 Bihar FIR against minister

 OUR BUREAU

 Jai Prakash Narain Yadav

 Oct. 22: Union minister Jai Prakash Narain Yadav has been accused of causing the illegal escape of his brother, an RJD candidate who was arrested and freed on bail, in an FIR.

 The FIR was filed at Khaira police station in Jamui, 200 km from Patna, from where Vijay Prakash Yadav was freed on October 18.

 Superintendent of police Arvind Kumar today said the junior water resources minister was accused of influencing and pressurising police illegally to release his brother and his two associates. The three were held before close of the first round of polling after being caught with arms, liquor and cash.

 Munger divisional commissioner S.K. Sinha, who probed the incident on an Election Commission order, has submitted his report confirming that the minister was at the police station for over three hours on Tuesday night and holding the officer in-charge, Mukeshwar Yadav, responsible for Vijay Prakashs illegal release. 

 Chief secretary G.S. Kang said necessary action would be taken.

 The Opposition BJP has demanded the immediate arrest and sacking of Jai Prakash. The registration of an FIR proves there was prima facie involvement of the Union minister in securing the illegal release of his brother who was arrested for a serious offence?. He must be sacked forthwith and arrested, general secretary Arun Jaitley said in Patna.

 Kumar said the police were looking for Vijay Prakash and Mukeshwar, who has also been named in the FIR. Both were declared absconders and police have raided the houses of the Union minister in Barhet and Patna, Kumar said.

 But the RJD nominee has filed a counter-case accusing Kumar and 25-30 unknown special task force personnel of plotting to kill him under the influence of the local Janata Dal (United) candidate. 

 The next hearing in the Jamui chief judicial magistrates court is on November 14. 

 The RJD defended its candidate. Every party nominee who has not got official security has the right to protect himself by arranging necessary arms, a party leader said.

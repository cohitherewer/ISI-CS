 Sisters get passes to church college

 RUDRA BISWAS

 Ranchi, June 26: For the first time in Jharkhand, St Alberts College, which claims to be the biggest theological college in the country, has admitted six sisters for the three-year Bachelor of Theology course.

 However, with the Vatican continuing to ban women from conducting mass, Cardinal Telesphore P. Toppo clarified that the sisters have joined the theology course for attaining academic excellence only. 

 In other words, it means they would not attain priesthood.

 On completion of their course, the sisters would play an important role in enriching others like them, lead prayer groups and even teach in seminaries.

 Of the six sisters who have joined the new batch of theology at the college, two are from St Annes Convent, Ranchi, and one each from the Franciscan Clarissan parish, Hazaribagh, Delhi province, Mary Immaculate, Calcutta, and Mother Generalate, Krishnagar, Bengal.

 Even for men, not all who successfully complete their bachelor of theology course are ordained as priests. It is only a select few who, on the will of God, are finally allowed to conduct mass. The theology course is open to everyone, including non-Christian men and women, provided the aspirants possess the basic knowledge of philosophy, Cardinal Toppo said.

 The cardinal said that the Roman Catholic Church was the largest and most organised congregation of Christians with the highest number of nuns and sisters in its fold.

 Equality between the sexes is unlikely to be achieved by merely ordaining women as priests, he added.

 When told the Protestant Gossner Evangelical Lutheran Church recently inducted a number of women, Toppo said the arbitrary actions of Protestant churches stood in the way of unity among the different churches.

 To accommodate the six sisters, St Alberts will soon come up with a newly-designed curriculum, which will not include practical sessions, including mass in a parish, as part of the Vaticans resolve to keep women at a distance from priesthood.

 Rector of the college Fr C.R. Prabhu told The Telegraph that 16 men and six sisters have enrolled themselves for the fresh batch. For the honours course, which is mandatory in case students intend to do their Masters, the students are required to undergo a years practical training in the different parishes, including conducting mass. For the sisters, we will introduce newer avenues of practical training, Fr Prabhu said.

 The rector added that on completion of the one-year practical session, the other students would be eligible for priesthood.

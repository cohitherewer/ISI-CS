 Rough ride for study bill

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 15: The long-pending legislation for free and compulsory education has run into rough weather with members of the Central Advisory Board of Education opposing unauthorised changes to the bill.

 Additions and deletions made recently to the draft of the Right to Education Bill, 2005, presented to the board yesterday, render it ineffective in regulating private schools and take away the right of students to study in their mother tongues, said board members.

 The members also objected to the rephrasing of a clause that withdraws all financial obligations of the Centre towards elementary education. This will be an abdication of the states constitutional obligation, a member said.

 The lack of monitoring of private schools would lead to the governments withdrawal from elementary education, lawyer-activist Teesta Setalvad said in her presentation to the board headed by human resource development minister Arjun Singh.

 The board also expressed concern that while the structure and functioning of the RSS-run shishu mandirs were being monitored by the government, the curriculum is being ignored. 

 They felt that the curriculum in shishu mandirs and madarsas should be monitored to ensure that it is in line with the secular and pluralistic ideals of the Constitution.

 Private unaided schools could be established without fulfilling the norms prescribed in the schedule of the act and function for extended periods without recognition in the absence of monitoring, said Anil Sadgopal, a professor of education at Delhi University. State schools, he said, could not be established unless this condition is fulfilled.

 Flood grounds Vizag airport

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Oct. 16: Visakhapatnam went under waist-deep water as rainfall lashed the port city for three days in a row.

 The downpour ? at 23 cm, it was the worst to hit the city in two decades ? has left the airport and houses flooded.

 Personnel of the eastern naval command carried out rescue operations across the city on boats.

 Ten bodies were traced today, taking the statewide toll to 35. Most of the deaths were due to house collapse, drowning, electrocution and lightning in the eight coastal and three Telengana districts, Shashank Goel, the state commissioner for disaster management, said.

 Water from an overflowing upstream reservoir seeped into the airport, which continued to be closed for the third day. The floodgates of the reservoir were opened due to heavy inflow, which led to inundating of the airport complex, including the lounge, tarmac and the runway, said district revenue officer Satyanarayana.

 This is the second time in the past month that the airport has been closed for so long because of a flooded runway.

 Nearly 1,500 tourists, mostly from Bengal, are stranded since Friday with the roads to Araku Valley and the prehistoric caves at Belum flooded.

 School and government offices were shut yesterday and will stay closed tomorrow. Most cinema halls and shopping malls, too, downed shutters for the third consecutive day.

 Diesel pumps have been pressed into service in Visakhapatnam and Kakinada towns to flush out water from homes and streets.

 Over 2,500 families from low-lying areas have been shifted to safety by boats, said a spokesperson for the naval command. Passengers stranded at the Visakhapatnam airport were also rescued by naval boats, said district collector Praveen Prakash.

 Thousands of steel workers could not make it to work yesterday. Bangarubabu said that when he woke up, the water had reached his front door. The milkman and paper boy were nowhere in sight.

 After a review of the situation with district collectors via video link, state revenue minister D. Prasada Rao said rescue, relief and rehabilitation activities were on in full swing and around 20,000 persons have been provided shelter in 150 camps.

 The rains have stopped now in the coastal districts and the north-east monsoon has moved over to Rayalseema and Kerala, said D. Subramaniam, the director of the cyclone warning centre at Visakhapatnam.

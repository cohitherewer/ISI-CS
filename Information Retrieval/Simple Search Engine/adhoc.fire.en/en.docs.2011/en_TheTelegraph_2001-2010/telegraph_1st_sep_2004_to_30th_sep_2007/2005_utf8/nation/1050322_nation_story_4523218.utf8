 Zarin and Bilal: VIP lunch

 New Delhi, March 21: Three ? not one ? Musharrafs were at the Prime Minister?s table this noon but there was no Kashmir. The guests and the hosts discussed more delectable issues like cricket and a common link ? a teacher.

 Manmohan Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur today played host to the family of the Pakistan President at the Prime Minister?s residence.

 Pervez Musharraf?s mother Zarin, son Bilal and brother Javed, who are on a private visit to India, were invited to lunch by Singh and his wife.

 Over a Mughlai repast from the Singhs? kitchen, the Prime Minister and Javed recalled their fond memories of Professor Gautam Mathur, who had taught both of them in Punjab University.

 Javed, who majored in economics from there, was junior to Singh at the university, said sources close to the Prime Minister. Javed said he was in touch with Mathur?s son, who works for the International Food and Agriculture Development Agency. 

 ?The lunch was a private affair,? a source said. The Musharrafs spent an hour and a half with the Singhs. 

 While Singh enquired from Zarin of her days in India and her friends and relatives living here, Gursharan Kaur told the family that Musharraf and his wife must have a meal with them when in Delhi. 

 Zarin, Bilal and Javed arrived in India on March 16. Among their stopovers were their ancestral home in Delhi?s Daryaganj, Aligarh Muslim University, where Zarin had studied, and Lucknow.

 In Parliament, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh said if Musharraf wants to discuss any issue during his visit here for the cricket match, India will be willing to do so.

 ?President Musharraf is coming here on April 16 evening to watch the cricket match on April 17. If he wants to discuss any issue, we are willing to do so,? he said.

 India also announced today that visas would be granted on arrival to Pakistanis above 65 years and below 12 at the Attari checkpost from April 1. The applicants will be given a 30-day visitor?s visa.

 Court shot at backlog

 New Delhi, May 11 (PTI): Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti today unveiled a Rs 670-crore five-year plan to tackle the backlog of over 3.4 crore cases pending across the country.

 Seminar after seminar, it has become a favourite subject with the speakers to raise the topic of huge backlog in the courts but little is suggested about a solution to ease the pendency in the courts, he said.

 Commenting on a plan to implement information technology in the judiciary, the chief justice said it was a very refreshing plan to speed up the justice delivery system by fully computerising it.

 Lahoti said Rs 335 crore would be spent in the first phase, Rs 177 crore in the second and Rs 155 crore in the third to connect each and every court with the Supreme Court.

 This would lead to tracing a case right from the date of inception in any court to the ultimate decision of the apex court, he said, and added that computerisation would also solve the delay caused by manual handling of cases.

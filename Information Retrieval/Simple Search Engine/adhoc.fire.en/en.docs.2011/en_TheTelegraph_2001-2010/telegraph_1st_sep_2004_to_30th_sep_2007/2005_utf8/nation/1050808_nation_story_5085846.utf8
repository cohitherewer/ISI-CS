 Mum on Mamata with eye on poll 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: The Congress is keeping its options open for a tie-up with the Trinamul Congress for next years Bengal Assembly polls with the party maintaining conspicuous silence in the Lok Sabha over the Mamata Banerjee episode.

 On Thursday afternoon, Congress members turned silent spectators when angry members belonging to the Left parties vociferously demanded an unconditional apology from the Trinamul leader. 

 Mamata had thrown a bunch of papers at the Speakers chair on being barred from raising the issue of illegal Bangladeshi migrants. The subject had already been debated in the House.

 Half-a-dozen Congress members, who are prone to habitually countering the Opposition, were quickly told they need not show solidarity with the Left. The MPs, none of whom are from Bengal, calmed down, leaving the Left benches guessing about the Congresss intentions.

 Left leaders repeatedly insisted that an experienced parliamentarian like defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is also the leader of the House, should share with the members what he thought of Mamatas conduct. But Mukherjee, who also heads the Bengal Congress, kept his counsel.

 Tongues started wagging in the Left. The Congresss calculations are determined by the considerations of Bengals electoral politics, said a prominent CPM member outside the House.

 A brief meeting of floor leaders in Speaker Somnath Chatterjees chamber ? aimed at ending the turmoil caused by the Mamata incident ? convinced the Left that the Congress was indeed going soft on the Trinamul leader.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who attended the meeting, is said to have virtually toed the BJPs soft line ? that the matter should end with a general condemnation in the House of the incident without specifically naming Mamata.

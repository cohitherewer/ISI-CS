 Mobs protest shrine demolition

 Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh government?s 

 initiative to remove religious shrines blocking traffic 

 has received a setback with the minorities protesting against 

 demolishing of five mosques on Saturday, reports our special 

 correspondent.

 Mobs ran riot on the Hyderabad-Mumbai National Highway on Saturday while four places of worship were being pulled down for the construction of a four-lane highway.

 Protesters pelted stones on revenue and police officials and gheraoed senior officials for over six hours till the demolition was stopped between the Rudraram and Muttangi villages on the outskirts of the state capital.

 People attacked state minority welfare minister Mohammed Fariduddin and minority welfare corporation chairman Farooq Hussain, holding them responsible for the demolition. Majlis-e-Itahadul-Musalmeen (MIM) leaders also joined the mobs in condemning the demolition. 

 District collector Anil Kumar Singhal was abused by MIM legislator and leader in the Assembly Akbaruddin Owaisi, who demanded reconstruction of the mosques on the same spot. The MIM leaders and the mobs held the collector and the officials hostage till evening.

 ?We cannot implement it (the government?s order), if there is such political intervention. I have complained to the chief secretary about it and also seeking legal opinion on the kind of ill-treatment meted out to me by the MIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi,? Singhal said.

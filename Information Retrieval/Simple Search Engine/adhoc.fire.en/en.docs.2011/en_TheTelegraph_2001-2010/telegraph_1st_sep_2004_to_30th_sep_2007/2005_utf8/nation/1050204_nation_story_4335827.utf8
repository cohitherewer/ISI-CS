 Kharagpur tech school networks campus 

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: IIT Kharagpur has moved to the next level of education dissemination by networking its campus, thus linking up hostel rooms, laboratories, classrooms and tutorial centres.

 ?The project is part of the plan to develop a comprehensive e-learning platform that will form the next level of the IIT education system,? said C.S. Kumar, assistant professor, mechanical engineering department.

 The project was conceived during the institute?s Golden Jubilee Partnership Programme in 2001 with a fund of Rs 30 crore allotted by the IIT Foundation.

 The IIT Foundation is a non-profit organisation comprising IIT Kharagpur alumni whose primary aim is to raise funds to enhance the institute?s education imparting capabilities.

 Cisco, a networking company, was in charge of creating and connecting the points of access and HCL Comnet was responsible for the implementation. The institute?s Centre for Educational Technology (CET) developed the content.

 ?Around 40 lectures of the 74 courses offered at IIT-K have been digitised into video mode by CET,? Kumar said.

 ?Students will also have access to library content, journals and research material. It will also allow students access to streaming voice, video and data access through 8 mbps bandwidth for Internet access.?

 Since the network is the first of its kind among the IITs, there is no equivalent database to access. The content, including lecture material, will also be available to companies and universities with which IIT Kharagpur has tie-ups.

 The project will benefit over 4,500 students in 14 hostels and, subsequently, two more recently added hostels, with a capacity of 800 each.

 The second phase will network the residential areas of faculty members, enabling students to consult them through videoconferencing.

 Cong seeks late polls 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: The Congress and two of its allies will approach the Election Commission with a proposal to hold the Bihar polls in two phases after November 8 instead of the four-phase schedule announced on Saturday.

 The decision to lead a joint delegation with UPA allies Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Nationalist Congress Party to the commission on Wednesday was taken this morning before Congress chief Sonia Gandhi left for a two-day visit to her constituency Rae Bareli.

 We will put up a request to the commission on September 7 for two-phase polling after November 8, party general secretary Digvijay Singh said. The RJD and the NCP, he added, were also in favour of two-phase polls.

 Singh, who returned to Delhi after four days of consultations with Bihar leaders in Patna, said the four-phase schedule ? the first is on October 18 and the last on November 19 ? would be inconvenient for campaigning because of festivals like Dussehra, Ramazan and Chhat.

 Earlier, Congress leader Ambika Soni had also pitched for a shorter duration on the ground that sustaining the campaign would be costly for both parties and candidates.

 Singh made it clear that the Congress would not hesitate to field candidates against Ram Vilas Paswans nominees if he persisted with his stand of having nothing to do with the RJD unless Laloo Prasad Yadav accepts his proposal that a Muslim be made chief minister.

 About Paswans offer yesterday not to field candidates against sitting Congress MLAs, Singh said his party was under no obligation to reciprocate. If he is not part of the RJD-led front, then it is not going to be quid pro quo from our side, he said.

 Sources said Sonia will try to persuade Paswan to give up his anti-RJD stand. The Lok Janshakti Party leader is expected to meet Sonia soon.

 With the Congress adopting a tough stand, Paswan sounded subdued today. I have decided not to put up candidates against the Congress. That is my partys position. I cant interfere with the decisions that the Congress takes in Bihar, he said.

 The Janata Dal (United), on the other hand, has already ruled out a possible alliance with Paswan in Bihar. Paswan has lost any ground that he had gained in Bihar, Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav said.

 According to Yadav, Paswans negative role in government formation after the last election has harmed him. The Bhumihars were with him last time round. So were a lot of musclemen. But most of these elements have moved away from Paswan, he said.

 The political forces in Bihar, said a senior Dal (U) leader, have shifted to present a bipolar contest in Bihar with the Laloo Prasad-led UPA on one side and the Dal (U)-led NDA on the other.

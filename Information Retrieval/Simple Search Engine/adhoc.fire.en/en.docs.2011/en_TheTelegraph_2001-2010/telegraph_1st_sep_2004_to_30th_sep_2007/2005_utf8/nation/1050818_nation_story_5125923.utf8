 Modi rivals keep Advani out of loop

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: As the anti-Narendra Modi legislators braced themselves for a fight to the finish against the Gujarat chief minister yet again, BJP chief L.K. Advani went into a huddle with his general secretaries this evening to take stock of the situation.

 Sources in the anti-Modi camp, however, made it clear they were not interested in meeting either Advani or his office-bearers, including Om Prakash Mathur, the Gujarat prabhari (in-charge).

 For the past year, we were knocking desperately on Advanis door. We sought his intervention to do something about Modi and Gujarat but there was no response. When we managed to meet him, his response was he would come to the state and hear out our problems. That never happened. We do not want to see him now, said a senior MP.

 He said according to their amended tactic, they would engage other leaders like A.B. Vajpayee and members of the BJP parliamentary board in resolving the impasse. Accordingly, the anti-Modi camp met Murli Manohar Joshi, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat today.

 There was another change of tack. Instead of flying down the dissident MLAs to the capital, they were advised by Keshubhai Patel ? the pivot of the counter-Modi campaign ? to stay put in Gandhinagar and let him and the others work out a strategy and battle on their behalf.

 Patel, a Rajya Sabha member, arrived this morning after putting up a show of strength in the Gujarat capital yesterday. While Patel is reportedly uninterested in the chief ministers post, two of his loyalists ? Vallabhai Katheria and Kashiram Rana ? are. Both are Lok Sabha MPs.

 Sources claimed Katheria had a better chance because he was younger than Rana and a Patel to boot. Modis dispensation allegedly gave short shrift to the Patels, the most powerful caste grouping in Gujarat. Sources said if the BJP has to retain its support, it is imperative to replace Modi (from the backward caste of oil-pressers) with a Patel.

 Patels camp claimed that 67 of the 129 BJP legislators went to his residence to call on his wife who underwent heart surgery in the US and returned after a long convalescence. 

 Patels arrival galvanised the anti-Modi MLAs into instant activity. Sources said the catalysts were:

 Advanis considerably undermined position in the BJP. In the past, a nod from him was enough to ensure Modis continuance. When approached by reporters, Advani refused to speak on Gujarat.

 The Nanavati Commissions report on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, which forced Jagdish Tytler to step down as a Union minister. The expectation is that Modi would be named in the list of culpable persons as the same Nanavati is, along with another judge, probing the Godhra and post-Godhra violence. 

 The withdrawal of the RSS-VHPs backing. 

 But sources close to Advani said Modi will not be sacked at this juncture.

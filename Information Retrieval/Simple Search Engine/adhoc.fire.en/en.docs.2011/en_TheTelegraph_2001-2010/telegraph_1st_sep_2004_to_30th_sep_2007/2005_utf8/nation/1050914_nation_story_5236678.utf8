 Salman seeks SC succour

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Salman Khursheed has taken his battle against Mulayam Singh Yadav to the Supreme Court after efforts to get the high commands nod for a campaign against the state government drew a blank.

 Khursheed had appeared before the apex court two days ago to argue in favour of a petition that sought to expose glaring instances of corrupt and fraudulent activities committed by the Mulayam Singh government.

 The PIL said residential plots in a posh Lucknow colony were allotted to top bureaucrats and politicians close to the ruling Samajwadi Party. It mentioned the names of 28 beneficiaries of the largesse, including Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh who was given a plot under a scheme for the economically weaker sections.

 Khursheeds legal approach against Mulayam Singh is being seen in political circles as a shift in strategy as his sustained campaign to topple the Samajwadi Party government has not received much support from the Congress central leadership.

 The high command has not even allowed the state Congress to withdraw the outside support it offers to the Mulayam Singh government.

 Asked why his party was not withdrawing support, the state Congress chief said: Our support was only for the formation of the government. We are now working in the Assembly and outside as an Opposition party.

 Khursheed and Congress legislature party leader Pramod Tewari accused the Mulayam Singh government of large-scale political murder of rivals. 

 The state government, senior ministers are shielding the perpetrators of these political murders committed in broad daylight, Tewari said, citing last months killing of Pratapgarh district youth Congress chief Satish Shukla.

 Khursheed wants the Manmohan Singh government at the Centre to make a case for dislodging the Mulayam Singh regime because of the law and order situation in the state. 

 When the Prime Minister visited Lucknow recently, the state Congress had submitted a memorandum in this regard. We hope the information we have provided would be closely scrutinised by the Centre, Khursheed said.

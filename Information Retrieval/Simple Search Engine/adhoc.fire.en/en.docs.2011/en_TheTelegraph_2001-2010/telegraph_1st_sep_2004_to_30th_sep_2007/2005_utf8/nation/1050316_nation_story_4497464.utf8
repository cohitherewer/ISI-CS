 Cong bows to Speaker 

 New Delhi, March 15: Presiding officers of legislatures in Congress-ruled states will attend the Sunday meeting convened by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, reports our special correspondent.

 Although there are doubts within the ruling United Progressive Alliance about the advisability of holding a meeting of presiding officers when Parliament is in session, the party said the Speaker?s power to call such a meeting must be honoured. 

 ?It is a convention that the Speaker, who is the highest legislative authority in the country, convenes the meeting of presiding officers. There has not been a single instance of the presiding officers boycotting such meetings,? party spokesman Anand Sharma said.

 The BJP has directed presiding officers in the states it rules to skip the meeting, called to discuss the Supreme Court?s ruling on Jharkhand.

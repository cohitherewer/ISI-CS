 Chennai, March 7: P. Chidambaram today hinted at expanding the service tax net to possibly include doctors and lawyers. 

 ?The service tax net may progressively be widened in future and this tax net may include lawyers and doctors too.... We don?t know,? the Union finance minister told a special budget meeting organised by the state Congress at Kamaraj Bhavan tonight.

 Chidambaram said an eye would be kept on the use of the budget?s allocation for various programmes to ensure optimum results. ?Financial outlays for every (central) department will have to be converted into physical outcomes.?

 As much as Rs 75,000 crore has been allocated for sectoral projects under the Centre?s national common minimum programme (CMP), he said.

 The Planning Commission, Chidambaram said, is already on the job of getting all central departments to prepare their individual targets to match their funds for 2005-06.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ?is very resolute on this?, he said.

 The move, the minister added, has come in the wake of a recent complaint that he received from a person in Theni district, who alleged that only Rs 25 lakh of a Rs 1.85-crore irrigation tank desilting scheme had been spent and the rest pilfered. The complainant had demanded a CBI inquiry.

 He said constant political vigilance alone could stop embezzlement of funds that the Centre earmarks for rural development and other programmes.

 Explaining the budget?s nitty-gritties in simple Tamil, Chidambaram advocated a wise mix of spending and saving as almost every section of people would benefit in some measure from the tax reforms initiated. For every gain of Rs 100, ?you must spend Rs 60 and save Rs 40?, he said.

 He thanked Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi for their support of his tax reforms, particularly of personal income-tax.

 Chidambaram said that as his party was part of a coalition, he had to do a balancing act to present a workable budget that did not raise tax for all sections of people but also cut customs duties in line with WTO commitments and, at the same time, provided enough for CMP projects.

 The corporate sector, he said, would eventually benefit from the net result of all the budget?s tax proposals made for it.

 Chidambaram took the opportunity to refute chief minister Jayalalithaa?s charge that the Centre was not providing enough funds for tsunami aid in Tamil Nadu, as also for other schemes like the Sethu Samudram project and the Chennai sea-water desalination plant.

 The Centre?s commitment to providing tsunami aid in all affected states was mentioned at the very beginning of the budget speech, the minister said, taking a dig at Jayalalithaa.

 Banks, he said, were ready to lend to tsunami-affected fishermen to help them buy one of two kinds of fishing vessels under the Centre?s modified scheme that subsidises up to half the cost. Loans will be sanctioned within 48 hours of submitting applications, he added.

 Chidambaram hoped that the state government would end the ?needless? controversy.

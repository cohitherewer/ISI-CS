 Jallianwala Bagh with batons

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 Gurgaon, July 25: Honda 

 Motorcycles employees injured in the Gurgaon lathicharge 

 have accused the police of killing their colleagues and 

 dumping bodies in the gutters.

 The local administration did not list any figure of fatalities but the workers said many of their colleagues and supporters were still missing.

 Suchinder Singh, the vice-president of the unregistered workers union in the company, said he had been told that 12 of his colleagues had died.

 I have been unconscious and it is difficult to say who is missing or dead right now. But my supporters say 12 could be dead. Many of my colleagues are missing. We dont know where the police took them, said Suchinder from a hospital bed in Gurgaon.

 Sources said the police were on edge after the workers beat up the DSP and set a sub-divisional magistrates car on fire during the showdown over the Delhi-Jaipur highway blockade. When the workers later reached the mini-secretariat, the police struck back, they added.

 It was the police who first started beating workers which made them retaliate, an eyewitness said.

 Suchinder, who was among those who went to the mini-secretariat to hand over a memorandum, suffered injuries on his leg and head. 

 At the instance of four Japanese officials, the police attacked us like the British at the Jallianwala Bagh incident, he said.

 When we reached the mini-secretariat and were just debating about handing over the memorandum, deputy commissioner Sudhir Rajpal asked us to come forward. Suddenly as we moved forward, we were attacked from behind by the police without any warning. I was surrounded by 10 policemen and was beaten. There was just no way to escape, Suchinder said. 

 The hospital and the premises of local police stations were overflowing with people trying to locate their relatives. Union leaders said the police had taken away people who were being released after first aid.

 Gokul, a Honda paint-shop worker with injury marks on his leg, too, said the police came from behind.

 First, they hit me on my back. I tried to run away by climbing the wall. But 10 to 12 policemen surrounded me and starting beating me, he said.

 A Honda official refused to comment on the clash. This is an event that has taken place outside our factory premises, PTI quoted the unnamed official as saying.

 Asked whether the company was ready to provide financial assistance to the injured, he said it could be considered if a specific request came in. If someone makes a request, we will take the issue up with the management, he said.

 Swami convicted of killing wife

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Sept. 14: A self-proclaimed godman who charmed an aristocratic woman away from her diplomat husband, married her and then buried her alive to gain her wealth was today described as a cunning, scheming, heartless person by Karnataka High Court.

 The court held Swami Shraddhananda guilty of killing Shakereh, his wife and granddaughter of the late Sir Mirza Ismail, diwan of erstwhile Mysore state, but put off sentencing till September 19.

 Shakerehs ex-husband Akbar Khaleeli, former high commissioner to Australia, and her youngest daughter Esmath Khaleeli hugged each other in the courtroom as the verdict was read out. 

 The bench of Justices S.R. Bannurmath and K.C. Kabbin was hearing the 60-year-old swamis appeal against a death sentence by the trial court.

 On May 21 this year, additional city civil and sessions judge B.S. Thotad had ordered that Shraddhananda be hanged by neck until death, ending an 11-year trial featuring DNA evidence. Today, the high court said the lower courts judgment was just and proper and needs no interference.

 The stocky Shraddhananda, originally Manohar Mishra of Sagar in Madhya Pradesh, is a high-school dropout. He met the Khaleelis while working for a royal family in Uttar Pradesh. 

 His boasts of special spiritual powers dazzled Shakereh, whom he promised a baby boy. She divorced Akbar Khaleeli in 1985 and married Shraddhananda in April the following year.

 The case made headlines when Shakereh was reported missing by her eldest daughter Sabah. 

 Her complaint of June 10, 1992, said her mother had not been seen since March 28, 1991. The city police registered a case. 

 Two years later, on April 30, 1994, Shraddhananda was taken into custody after a domestic help told the city crime branch that the swami had murdered his wife.

 The body was exhumed from a 100-foot pit dug under the porch of Khaleelis sprawling mansion, which had come to Shakereh, in the heart of Bangalore.

 The prosecution proved Shraddhananda had laced Shakerehs tea with sedatives and buried her alive under the porch.

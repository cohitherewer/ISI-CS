 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The Delhi government has been left red in the face over its effort to provide relief to those hit by the tsunami, with a cabinet minister allegedly having links with a city trader accused of supplying sub-standard tarpaulin covers meant for the victims.

 Delhi police are yet to arrest Pramod Aggarwal of Aggarwal Tirpal Udyog, 24 hours after a divisional commissioner in charge of relief, G.K. Marwah, registered an FIR charging the company with cheating and breach of contract for supplying 10,000 damaged tarpaulin covers worth Rs 15 lakh.

 However, the north district?s deputy commissioner of police, Rajesh Khurana, said today that the case had just been registered and ?the legal process has just begun?. The groundwork for the action is being prepared and the department has been asked to submit all the documents so that ?actionable evidence can be collected?, Khurana said.

 Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit denied any nexus between the cabinet minister and the trader. ?There is no such thing. Delhi police have already registered an FIR and the consignment has been stopped,? Dikshit said.

 The minister admitted to having recommended the trader, but refused to take the blame for the supply of sub-standard covers. 

 ?It is true that I knew the trader. I only suggested his name when Raj Kumar Chauhan, the Delhi development minister, said they wanted huge supplies and if I could suggest someone. There is nothing wrong in that,? said the minister accused of being in the supply nexus.

 Chauhan said the department has begun blacklisting contractors for supplying sub-standard material. ?It is really inhuman that something that was meant to be sent as relief to the victims is being used as a business opportunity by these traders.?

 The sub-standard material has given the Opposition a stick to beat the Congress with. ?The minister had recommended the trader. The material was of such inferior quality that it was not worth even one-fourth its price. I have told the lieutenant governor and the chief minister that the minister should no longer be allowed to remain in his post,? said Jagdish Mukhi, the leader of Opposition in the Vidhan Sabha.

 The Delhi government gave the order for the tarpaulin covers to Aggarwal Tirpal Udyog after the lowest bidder failed to supply the material. The first consignment of 4,700 covers had been airlifted on December 30. The remaining material was stopped after a sample from the first consignment was found to be defective.

 The Rs 8-lakh payment for the first consignment has not been made. After the second consignment was stopped, the trader sought to donate the material, but the divisional commissioner did not agree as a government order could not be converted into a donation.

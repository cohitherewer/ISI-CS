 MP caught on camera with deer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, June 24: Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, against whom a non-bailable warrant of arrest under the Crime Control Act has been issued, is once again in the thick of controversy.

 STAR News has put out a photograph that shows the Rashtriya Janata Dal MP and some other people armed with guns and standing behind a dead deer. The picture was allegedly one of the many objectionable articles seized by police during a raid on his house at Pratappur, 180 km from here, on April 24.

 The police had also seized a live deer from his premises during the raid. Some of Shahabuddins witnesses, who had appeared before district magistrate Santosh Kumar Malls court on Monday, claimed that the animal was orphaned by floods two years ago and rescued by villagers.

 This is just one picture. There are so many other evidences that can prove him guilty of many crimes of the wildlife act, a source said.

 Taking objection to Shahabuddins failure to report to the court in spite of being in Patna on that day, Mall ordered his arrest and directed the police to produce him on July 1.

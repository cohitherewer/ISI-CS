 Mumbai, Dec. 1: The condition of Amitabh Bachchan is stable, hospital authorities said today. 

 The administrative officer of Leelavati Hospital in the city, where the actor was operated upon yesterday, said this evening that he was well on the way to recovery. 

 Amitabh Bachchan was operated upon last evening at 6.30 for jejunal perforation. He is in the ICU now and has been advised a lot of rest. He is likely to be shifted to another part of the hospital soon, she said. 

 It would be up to the doctors to decide when Bachchan would be discharged, she said, but medical sources said he would be in the ICU for two or three days and was likely to be discharged within 10 days.

 The sources said Bachchan had reported normal for the several tests that he was taken through. His blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate and pulse rate were normal, they said. 

 The actor, who is 64, was operated upon by a five-member team of doctors for diverticulitis of small intestine.

 The surgeons also removed some of the old tissues which were remnants of the 1982 injury that he had sustained during the shooting of Coolie, sources said. A tissue sample has been sent for biopsy, but they said this was routine. 

 Bachchan was admitted to the hospital on Monday. He had been to Lucknow to attend a function in memory of his father Harivansh Rai Bachchan. He reportedly ate some kachoris, which seem to have started a severe abdominal pain. 

 For three days, his family has avoided making any statement on Bachchans health, fearing an exaggerated reaction, despite the surging crowds in and around the hospital. Two vans packed with policemen are on guard there. 

 Bachchans closest friends industrialist Anil Ambani, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh and industrialist Subroto Roy visited him earlier in the day. Ambanis wife Tina is in constant attendance. 

 I spoke to Amitabh. He is well and recovering, Singh, whom Bachchan calls bada bhai, said in the morning. 

 Other star visitors included Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray, in the eye of a storm after a rebellion by cousin Raj Thackeray, and his wife, actors Kajol and Ajay Devgan, Rishi and Neetu Kapoor, Jayaprada and Kirron Kher and filmmakers Ram Gopal Verma and Madhur Bhandarkar and friend Tinu Anand. Sunjay Dutt, Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif, Tabu, Akshay Kumar, Dimple Kapadia and Govinda had visited yesterday.

 Terror fight on ?summit? table

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, April 7: The meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf this month will for all practical purposes be a summit, and terrorism looks set to top the agenda.

 After yesterday?s fidayeen strike in Srinagar, Delhi is worried about coping with the situation if the peace bus comes under attack from terrorists.

 The brave face shown by the leadership this morning in flagging off the inaugural bus from Srinagar to Muzaffarabad may have helped Delhi salvage some pride after yesterday?s attack. However, it is uncertain how long tight security can be maintained to ensure passengers are safe.

 The Indian leadership, therefore, has to take the opportunity of Musharraf?s visit to extract a promise that he will do all he can to stop cross-border terrorism.

 Musharraf arrives in Delhi on a three-day visit on April 16 and is scheduled to watch the last one-day cricket match between India and Pakistan at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground.

 However, the match has been pushed to the background and the focus will now be on the peace process and how the two sides can find ways to show progress on Kashmir. 

 India has laboured to explain that the President?s meeting with the Prime Minister is not a summit. South Block has instead described it as a ?friendly visit?. However, it is clear that Musharraf?s visit will be regarded as a summit. The two leaders will meet to discuss important issues and may even come out with a joint statement.

 India will propose new confidence-building measures, but the Pakistan President?s sincerity about combating terrorism will remain the focus.

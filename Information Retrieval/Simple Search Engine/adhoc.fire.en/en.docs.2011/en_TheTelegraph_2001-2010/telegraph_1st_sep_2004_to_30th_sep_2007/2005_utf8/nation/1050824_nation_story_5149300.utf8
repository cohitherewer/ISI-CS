 Mobile missile blows up on actor

 M.R. VENKATESH

 A still from the film New

 Chennai, Aug. 23: Sizzling Simran in Suryas arms had been the original problem. Now Suryas mobile-turned-missile has snatched pride of place.

 A day after the sound and fury of the mobile turning 10, New actor S.J. Surya was arrested for allegedly flinging his mobile phone at a censor board member who snipped a song from the film as it was obscene and in bad taste.

 The Tamil actor, also the director of the film rumoured to be a take on the Tom Hanks starrer Big, had allegedly attacked Vanathy Srinivasan after the heat on New got too much for him to take. He was later freed on bail.

 From day one, womens groups had been protesting against the film which explores the relationship between a teenaged girl and an 11-year-old boy who is chemically transformed into a full-grown male by night.

 Then, Madras High Court turned up the heat, directing the censor board to revoke the certification granted to the film as it was nothing but vulgarity.

 Next, a woman advocate from Chennai filed a PIL against it on which the court banned screening of the film, though it had been a big draw at the box office. When the PIL was being heard, the court directed police to look into Srinivasans complaint.

 Amid allegations that New was being screened in some places with the objectionable song in place, the police picked up Surya on a non-bailable warrant and produced him before an Egmore court. He was remanded in 15 days judicial custody.

 Surya was, however, released on conditional bail after his counsel pointed out the offence was not a non-bailable one. Surya has given an undertaking that he will fully cooperate with investigations.

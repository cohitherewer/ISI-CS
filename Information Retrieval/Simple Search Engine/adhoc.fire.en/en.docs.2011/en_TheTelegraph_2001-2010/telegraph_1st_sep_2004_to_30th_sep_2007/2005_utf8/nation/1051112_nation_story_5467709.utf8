 (Top) Advani, Sudarshan: Patch up time?

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: After months of estrangement, RSS sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan and BJP president L.K. Advani are expected to meet at a function on November 18. 

 The occasion is the wedding of a BJP worker at the party headquarters on Ashoka Road but, party sources said, what made it distinctive was that the bride and the groom are both physically challenged. So, Sudarshan, Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee would be around to bless the couple.

 While BJP sources said they expected Sudarshan and Advani to do little else other than exchange pleasantries, the d?tente may cap the months of bitter wrangling in the Sangh parivar going back to the RSS chiefs televised interview on why the BJP needed new leaders.

 However, a chintan baithak (brainstorming session) of the RSS and BJP leaders has yet to materialise. Sudarshans second-in-command Mohanrao Bhagwat had said at the RSSs national executive at Chitrakoot last month that it would take place soon. Sources said the wedding could set the tone for the session which is meant to be a freewheeling discussion on the Sangh parivars present and future.

 Sangh sources claimed that Sudarshan wanted to leave the acrimony with the BJP and Advani behind and tone up the RSS whose image too, they admitted, had taken a beating in recent months. In the RSSs meetings, the sarsanghchalak was criticised for taking his battles with the BJP to the public domain ? something unthinkable in the days when the supremo would rarely emerge from the Nagpur cloister.

 Sudarshans propensity to join issue with the BJP on the smallest provocation had led to a debate within the Sangh on whether he should continue to lead it or not. There was a suggestion in Nagpur that in keeping with his own belief that it was time for younger leaders to steer the Sangh parivar, he should opt out and allow someone like Bhagwat to take over. 

 Recently, in an interaction with the media, Sudarshan denied that a change was in the offing.

 To undo the damage, sources said the RSS was keen to ensure Advani demitted office according to his December timeline without a hitch. The Sangh, they maintained, would keep a low profile to dispel the impression that it will have the veto power on the succession question.

 BCCI gets bid signal

 New Delhi, Dec. 16 (PTI): Delhi High Court today allowed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to invite fresh bids for grant of cricket telecast and broadcast rights in India for the next four years.

 A division bench of Justices M.K. Sharma and R.C. Chopra vacated the stay on the tender process, which Zee Telefilms had challenged as arbitrary and aimed at ousting Indian bidders.

 The green signal came after the BCCI filed an affidavit giving an undertaking to cancel the earlier tender process and invite fresh bids.

 However, Zee has not withdrawn its petition and has sought permission to respond to the affidavit. 

 The court granted Zee one week to file its response and posted the matter for further hearing on January 9.

 Air fares set to increase

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: Domestic air fares may rise following a five per cent hike in jet fuel prices.

 Jet and Sahara said they will hold meetings over the next week or so to discuss a fare surcharge. The fare rise could be now or with the winter schedule; we will decide soon, a Jet executive said.

 Jet fuel costs account for a third of an airlines operating costs; so a five per cent increase could mean a 2 per cent fare surcharge, if imposed.

 Smaller airline Spicejet said: We will take a decision tomorrow one way or the other; price hikes are tough nowadays with competition levels actually going up.

 Indian Airlines said it will wait and watch. Let others react; we will see what to do, an official said.

 The price of aviation turbine fuel had risen by 18.5 per cent in April, forcing all the three major domestic airlines to hike fares across the board by around 12 per cent. A smaller fare rise followed at the beginning of this month.

 The domestic jet fuel price had risen from Rs 27,250 a kilolitre to Rs 32,250 in April. It rose to Rs 32,322 a month ago, and will now touch Rs 33,922.

 With fuel prices rising, several international carriers have imposed fuel surcharge on their tickets. The hike in jet fuel was announced today after global oil prices touched an unprecedented high of $71 a barrel. For international airlines the hike would be in the range of $35-40 per kilolitre.

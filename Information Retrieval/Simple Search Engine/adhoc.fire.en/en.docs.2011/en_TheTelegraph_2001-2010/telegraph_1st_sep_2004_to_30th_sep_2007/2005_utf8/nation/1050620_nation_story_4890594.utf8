 Thackeray discloses Dutt poll promise

 Mumbai, June 19 (PTI): Bal Thackeray today said Sunil Dutt kept his promise of not contesting Lok Sabha elections against the Shiv Sena after seeking help for his son Sunjay in the Bombay blasts case.

 Sahab ne mere bachche ko bachaya. Main Shiv Sena ke khilaf election nahin ladunga (Thackeray has saved my son. I will not contest against the Sena nominee), the Sena leader quoted the actor-turned-politician as saying in the concluding part of an interview to party mouthpiece Saamna.

 Dutt, who died recently, had twice opted out of the poll fray but never explained the reason.

 Sunil Dutt kept his word and Madhukar Sarpotdar won the seat, Thackeray said, adding that the actor was an old friend and they often went with champagne to each others house.

 The Sena leader claimed: Dutt told me that NCP chief Sharad Pawar had ruined Sunjays life. Dutt trusted Pawars words and sent Sunjay, who was then abroad, to police.? He was arrested? kept rotting.

 The late Congress leader, Thackeray claimed, told him that he contested the last Lok Sabha elections on the insistence of party chief Sonia Gandhi.

 Thackeray also warned that he would crush anyone speaking about a separate state of Mumbai.

 I will crush them. I will crush that tongue? And the head. Let it be anyone. I will not care, he said.

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram had said in a conference last month that metropolitan cities like Delhi and Mumbai need authority with a sovereign character for better governance.

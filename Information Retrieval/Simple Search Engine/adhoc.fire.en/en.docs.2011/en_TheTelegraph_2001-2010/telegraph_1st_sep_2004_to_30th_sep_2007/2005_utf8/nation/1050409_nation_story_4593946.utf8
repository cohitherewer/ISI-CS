 Attack on RJD for train route cut

 - Cong gives Laloo party ?frustrated? tag

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 8: The Bihar Congress has launched a two-pronged attack on Laloo Prasad Yadav over his criticism of the party for not helping Rabri Devi return to power and truncating the Darbhanga-New Delhi Sampark Kranti Express, which was started recently.

 The Congress has expressed satisfaction that the decision to impose central rule ? instead of allowing a Rashtriya Janata Dal-led minority government come to office ? was in line with the mandate received in the Assembly elections.

 It has warned Laloo Prasad not to behave as the ?railway minister only of the Rashtriya Janata Dal? and remember that he was a minister in a Congress-led government. The party alleged that the decision to truncate the train ? and make it run from Muzaffarpur to Delhi ? was a result of the ?internal politics of the RJD?.

 ?The state Congress committee believes that the charge made by the RJD holding the party responsible for imposition of central rule is an act of political ungratefulness. The Congress has already given its letter of support to the RJD. This allegation is a clear sign of the RJD?s frustration. We strongly condemn the RJD leaders? statements blaming the Congress for the failure to form secular governments in Bihar and Jharkhand,? party spokesperson Prem Chandra Mishra said.

 Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan has been attacking the RJD for a long time. Now, the RJD?s relations with the Congress have also taken a nosedive. Despite strong rumours, the Congress high command has let Ram Jatan Sinha, who is known for his anti-Laloo stance, continue as the party?s state president.

 ?We also criticise the statement made by RJD leaders in which they have pressed the need to be wary of the Congress because our party wants to expand itself in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. If the Congress wants to strengthen itself, why does the RJD have a problem? Every party is free to make itself stronger in a democracy,? the spokesperson said.

 The Congress described the decision to truncate the train?s route as a ?fraud? on the people of Mithila region. ?Only a week ago, Laloo Prasad himself flagged off the biweekly train from Darbhanga. The railways had spent lakhs of rupees on advertising the inauguration. It is unfortunate that the photographs of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi are not being inserted in the rail advertisements,? Mishra said.

 The party said Laloo Prasad should ensure that the train ran according to the original schedule.

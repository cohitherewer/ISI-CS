 Advantage Paswan in Round II

 Paswan: All smiles?

 Patna, Feb. 13: As Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan are engaged in a competition for the Muslim and Dalit votes, the Congress and the BJP, which had hoped to profit from the slugfest, are wondering if they have not been too clever by half.

 The Congress? fond wish of wanting to ?fix? the Rashtriya Janata Dal by contesting several seats solo so that Laloo Prasad would be denied simple majority and it would have the ?key? to who would lead the next government has dissipated after the first round of polling. It is Paswan who may now benefit and he may well end up walking away with the ?key?.

 Congress sources admitted that given the Lok Janshakti Party leader?s inclination to do business with the NDA, he could do a Mayavati and take BJP-Janata Dal (United) support to become chief minister.

 Also, the already uncomfortable Laloo Prasad-Congress equation could become worse and make things tough for the UPA government on the eve of the budget session. The question asked by every Congress leader camping in Patna was: ?Was it worth sacrificing Laloo Prasad, who took the lead in legitimising Sonia Gandhi?s leadership at a time when the foreigner issue was raised by the NDA and Sharad Pawar, for the sake of a few seats in Bihar??

 The NDA, which banked on Paswan to do what it couldn?t for 15 years ? demolish Laloo Prasad ? finds the LJP eating into its upper caste votes. Its feedback is the Brahmins, Bhumihars and Rajputs are ?consolidated like never before? against Laloo Prasad and that like the Muslims, they are resorting to ?tactical? voting.

 This means they will plump for the candidate best suited to trounce the RJD even if he is from a Dalit-centric party like the LJP. So, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the darling of Bihar?s upper castes for years, is no longer the flavour of the season. Paswan has pipped him in the electoral sweepstakes, if only for expediency.

 BJP sources said they had revised their strategy for phase two and three of the elections to hammer home the message that Paswan is ?still cosy? with Laloo Prasad, no matter the ?outward? hostility.

 ?Our message to voters is don?t trust Paswan because he?s notoriously unreliable. He might say I will not shake hands with Laloo Prasad even if I am reborn seven times but if there?s a hung House, he will raise the secularism bogey and strike a hard bargain with the Congress and RJD,? a source said.

 The BJP?s ?information? is the ?hard? bargain entailed grabbing the railway ministry from Laloo Prasad in lieu of accepting a chief minister from the RJD and making one of his brothers, Ram Chander Paswan or Pashupati Nath Paras, the deputy chief minister.

 Congress sources denied any such pact is being thought up and dismissed it as an ?RSS-inspired? rumour to put down the UPA. ?If anything, such an offer may have come to Paswan from the NDA itself,? a source said.

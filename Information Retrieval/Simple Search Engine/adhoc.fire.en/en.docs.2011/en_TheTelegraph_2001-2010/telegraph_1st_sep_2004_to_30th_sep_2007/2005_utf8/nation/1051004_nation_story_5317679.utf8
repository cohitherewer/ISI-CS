 Fresh shot at guns hit by graft cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: The army today said it will seek bids from international manufacturers of towed and self-propelled cannons for an order of artillery guns that was put on the backburner after the government froze transactions with the South African firm, Denel, in June.

 The order is estimated to be more than Rs 12,000 crore. The army is in the market for 180 wheeled and 120 tracked 155mm/52 calibre howitzers that it plans to induct by 2010.

 Lt General S. Pattabhiraman, who took over today as the new vice-chief of army staff, said the allegations against Denel and the investigation ordered into them was a setback to the Indian armys artillery modernisation programme.

 He said the government will have to take a call on whether Denel can re-bid for the order. Among the companies that had bid for the order is SWS Defence, the latest avatar of Bofors.

 The army needs to upgun firepower in the 155mm calibre category of howitzers. The Bofors F/H 77 B is the only gun of this kind with the army. 

 Army headquarters can consider floating a tender again for the order. The defence establishment is still undecided if all the guns that have been tested would be re-tried.

 Among the guns in contention for the order before it was put on the backburner were Soltams TIG 2002 (Israeli), Bofors FH 77 B05L52 (Swedish) and the Denel G-5/2000.

 Lt Gen. Pattabhiraman added his key result area would be the modernisation of the special forces battalions. 

 India has developed an indigenous tactical battlefield command, control, communication and surveillance system which is in the process of being validated in live army exercises, adds PTI.

 We have developed a new TAC C3I system, comparable to any western army and this has already been validated during wargames conducted by the western army command, Lt Gen. Pattabhiraman said.

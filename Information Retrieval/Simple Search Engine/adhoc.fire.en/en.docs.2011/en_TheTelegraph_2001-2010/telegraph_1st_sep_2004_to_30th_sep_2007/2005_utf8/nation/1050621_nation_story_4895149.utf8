 Prank tag on calls to actor

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sachdev

 Mumbai, June 20: Mumbai police today downplayed the alleged extortion threats received by actor and TV personality Rajeshwari Sachdev, saying the telephone calls were made by a mischief-maker.

 There doesnt seem to be any evidence to show that (the) underworld is involved. We have lodged a (case of) non-cognisable offence, said deputy commissioner Amitabh Gupta.

 Rajeshwaris father Indrajeet Sachdev lodged a complaint at Versova police station on June 14 that his daughter had been receiving calls from an unknown person who demanded Rs 40 lakh as protection money. The caller neither identified himself nor referred to any underworld gang, the complaint said.

 Rajeshwari, who starred in several Shyam Benegal films before taking to television soaps, recently married actor Varun Badola. When asked if she suspected personal rivalry, Rajeshwari said: I have no idea. It was my duty to inform the police, and I have.

 Smriti Iraani, the star of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, had received death threats on phone earlier this year and the calls were traced to Balaji Telefilms scriptwriter Rekkha Modi. Police arrested Modi and a small-time actor. Investigations showed Modi had quarrels with Iraani on the sets of the TV serial and had made the calls to harass her. Modi denied the charges.

 Police statistics show that extortion calls to film personalities have dipped in the last two years.

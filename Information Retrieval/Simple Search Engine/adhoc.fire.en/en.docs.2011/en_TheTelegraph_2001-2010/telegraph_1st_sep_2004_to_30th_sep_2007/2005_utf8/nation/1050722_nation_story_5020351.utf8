 Class XI entry ruling 

 New Delhi, July 21 (PTI): Delhi High Court has ruled that schools cannot refuse admission to their students in a particular stream in Class XI on the grounds of merit when seats are still vacant. 

 Hearing a petition filed by N. Singh, a student of Delhi Public School, Mathura road, the court said the Class X exam cannot be regarded as a terminal examination for those who want to continue their studies in Class XI or XII in the same school. 

 Justice Vikramajit Sen directed DPS to admit Singh to the science stream in Class XI.

 Singh, who secured an overall percentage of 65.20 with 60 per cent in science and mathematics in this years CBSE Class X exam, was refused admission to the science stream on the ground that he had not been able to fare well enough for the stream.

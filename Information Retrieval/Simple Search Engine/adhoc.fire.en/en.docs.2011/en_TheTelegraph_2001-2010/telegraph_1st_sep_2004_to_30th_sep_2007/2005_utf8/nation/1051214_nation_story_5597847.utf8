 Big B fit for release

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Actor Shahrukh Khan and 

 his wife Gauri (PTI)

Mumbai, Dec.13: Amitabh Bachchans doctors said tonight that he was physically fit and could be discharged anytime. He is most likely to be discharged tomorrow, they said.

 However, unconfirmed reports suggest that the actor could be discharged late tonight or early tomorrow morning, so that he can slip out while it is still dark and elude the media.

 At the Lilavati hospital today, 

 actor Shahrukh Khan and his wife Gauri paid Bachchan a visit.

 What suggests that Bachchan could be released soon is the fact that his wife Jaya and son Abhishek visited the Siddhivinayak temple today.

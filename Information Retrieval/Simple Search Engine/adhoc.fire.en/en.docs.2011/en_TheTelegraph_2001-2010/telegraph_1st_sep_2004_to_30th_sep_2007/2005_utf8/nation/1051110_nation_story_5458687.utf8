 Childrens channels woo adult eyeballs

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Nov. 9: Losing the battle for the remote to your child may not be such a bore any more. Childrens channels, after hitting a plateau with their viewership in the past few years, have been focusing on content that appeals to kids and adults alike.

 Co-viewership programmes (those meant to appeal to both children and adults) are certainly on the rise as they get more eyeballs, confirmed Atul Phadnis, vice-president, Television Audience Measurement (TAM) India.

 The strategy to attract adult viewers is working, the latest figures show (see chart). The childrens and infotainment fragment now accounts for 3 per cent of the total Indian TV viewership ? a 50 per cent jump over the 2004 figure of 2 per cent.

 Content managers say the growth is driven by the shift in programming focus.

 We believe that multi-genre content has helped make kids TV more engaging for adult audiences. For example, in the evening, we have our games and sports block (GAS), Nick Ha-Ha-Ha comedy block and hosted shows, said Hema Govindan, general manager, Nickelodeon India. 

 Though targeted at tweens (aged 8-12 years), these programmes are fun for the whole family to watch together.

 The industry seems to have taken the cue from media buyers long-standing complaint that childrens channels lack the sort of innovative programming that could attract more eyeballs.

 There was a lack of innovativeness, said a senior official in a well-known media buying house, alluding to these channels over-dependence on foreign animation films. Then again, market leader Cartoon Network only has animation shows, which cater to children in the age group of 4 to 9 years. Because of this, children above 10 years are moving to other genres.

 Content managers of the kids channels admit the gap. Hungama has just come out with a family entertainment programme ? Hungama Fungama, shown on Saturdays and Sundays between 10 am and 12.30 pm. Other channels, too, are systematically making their programmes more broad-based.

 The Disney channel, primarily aimed at older kids, is doing more and more programmes that fetch co-viewership. The afternoon as well as the evening slots focus on movies and shows that can be enjoyed by the entire family, said Nachiket Pantvaidya, head of programming and production, Walt Disney TV International Ltd.

 The slots for pre-schoolers are also following suit. The Nick Jr block engages mothers to watch with the child and hence helps partnership in the learning process, Govindan said. 

 The results are showing even among children. TAM figures say viewership of kids channels among children (4-14 years) has gone up.

 Industry officials say children are watching TV longer and the prime-time slot for them has shifted from 2-5 pm to 6-9 pm, thus overlapping into the family viewing slots. The childrens channels are trying to take advantage of this with co-viewership programmes. 

 In the single-TV Indian household, such programmes are increasingly gaining popularity, an industry expert said.

 With increase in adult viewership, advertisement content on these channels is also changing. Just the other day, I noticed a commercial for electrical switches on a kids channel. This would have been unbelievable a year ago, Phadnis said.

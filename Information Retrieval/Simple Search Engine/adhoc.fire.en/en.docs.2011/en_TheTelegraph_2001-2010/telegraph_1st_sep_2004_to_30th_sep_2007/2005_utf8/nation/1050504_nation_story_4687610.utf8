 Orissa Opp. ire at delimitation

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 3: The proposed delimitation of the 21 parliamentary and 147 Assembly constituencies has sparked a political furore in the state.

 Leading the charge is the Orissa unit of the Congress, which has threatened to launch a statewide agitation against the delimitation process. State party president Jaydev Jena, who described the process as ?politically motivated?, alleged that it was a ploy to weaken the Congress base in the state.

 The delimitation process will favour MLAs and ministers of the ruling parties, he said, adding that some seats, from where Congress legislators were elected in the last polls, were not mentioned in the preliminary report.

 For example, the areas under Balikuda Assembly constituency in Jagatsinghpur district have been divided into the contiguous Tirtol and Erasama seats by the commission in its report. Similarly, Tirtol, an unreserved constituency, has been proposed as reserved for Dalits. ?This smacks of political vendetta by the ruling BJD-BJP combine in the state,? Jena said.

 The Congress chief said the party has requested the Delimitation Commission to consider the ?seriousness? of the matter.

 Congress MLA from Balikuda Umesh Swain alleged that the government has started the delimitation process to harass party MLAs. Echoing Jena?s views, he announced that they would soon meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party national president Sonia Gandhi in this regard.

 Orissa Gana Parishad president Bijay Mohapatra, too, flayed the move saying those involved in the process had no idea about the geography of the constituencies. ?These people (the state machinery) are misleading the commission,? he alleged.

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has dismissed the allegations, saying that the government was not part of the process and had nothing to do with it. The matter pertained to the Election Commission, he said.

 The delimitation of constituencies is based on the population figures for the 1971 census. The uneven growth of population in different parts of the country as well as within the same state and the continuous migration of people/electorate from one place to another have resulted in electoral constituencies of strikingly different sizes even within the same state.

 The Delimitation Commission seeks to correct the distortions on the basis of the 1991 census.

 Pension bill shelved, job takes its place 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 18: The controversial pension bill, which Left parties have branded anti-worker, will not see the light of day ? at least for now.

 The decision to bury the bill, part of the governments strategy not to ruffle its belligerent allies, has come with another. The Congress-led regime has decided to take up in Parliaments coming monsoon session the employment guarantee scheme, a pet topic with the Left.

 The scheme plans to employ one able-bodied person in each below-poverty-line family for 100 days in a year with minimum wages.

 The Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, which a parliamentary committee had cleared, was to be taken up during the monsoon session scheduled to begin on July 25. But with the entire Left bloc threatening to corner the government on the retrograde and anti-working class measure, the bill has not even been listed for introduction.

 The DMK, the governments southern ally, has also voiced concern about the bill.

 The Left parties have called the bill a fraud on central and state government employees and the unorganised working class. The safeguards in the bill, they say, are not adequate.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, however, disagreed with suggestions that the Left was out to rock the coalition boat and insisted that the government and its allies were working in close cooperation.

 They are not going to give up their issues and principles. The moment they give up there would not be a Left party but Congress party, but that does not mean that they vote against the government. The Left is a totally different entity. There are some fundamental issues where we have less meeting ground, but the bottom line is that they will support us for five years, the Congress leader said.

 The 33-day session, which will have 23 sittings, will take up 10 bills in all.

 Another controversial bill ? one that aims to reserve 33 per cent seats for women in Parliament and state legislatures ? is also missing from the government agenda.

 Azad said the government would introduce the bill only if there is consensus across the political spectrum. Home minister Shivraj Patil is still consulting various parties and the bill may be ready for tabling in the winter session, sources said.

 Referring to the Oppositions boycott of Parliament during the budget session, the minister said: I think the NDA will take part in the House proceedings, it is good for the House, democracy and also good for them, so that their attention is diverted from intra-party squabbles.

 An idle mind, he added, is the devils workshop.

 Azad said the government was ready to discuss any issue the Opposition wanted to. Asked if the UPA government would discuss the issue of tainted ministers, he replied in the affirmative.

 Among the bills that will be taken up during the monsoon session is the citizenship (amendment) bill. It intends to extend the facility of dual citizenship to overseas Indians in all countries (other than Bangladesh and Pakistan) beyond the 16 mentioned in the original act.

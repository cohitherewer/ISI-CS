 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: The cabinet today approved a 4 per cent increase in dearness allowance and a 21 per cent hike in dearness relief as a Puja bonanza for central government employees and pensioners.

 The package is expected to cost the national exchequer Rs 2,137.92 crore a year, information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy said after a cabinet meeting.

 Reddy said Dussehra and Diwali were also considered while recommending the hike. The increase in dearness allowance and dearness relief will come into force with retrospective effect from July 1. The arrears will be given in cash.

 The minister said the additional financial implication of the increase in dearness allowance would be Rs 1,521.92 crore a year while the dearness relief hike would cost about Rs 616 crore a year.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs, which met today, gave the go-ahead for implementing a Rs 631.83-crore hydrology project and setting up a tsunami warning centre. 

 The finance minister said the hydrology project would help improve the quality of hydrology and water-related data and enable framing of better water policies.

 The Centres component would be Rs 220.92 crore while the states would provide Rs 304.67 crore. There will be a contingency fund of Rs 106.24 crore for six years, the minister added.

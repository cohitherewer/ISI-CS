 Over to Centre, on Tytler

 Tytler

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: Jagdish Tytler faces no case in the 1984 riots, but witnesses have testified that he led mobs who butchered Sikhs ? so if the government chooses, it can take action against its minister.

 Twenty-one years after the riots that killed over 4,000 people ? 2,733 according to the government ? in the capital, the Nanavati Commission has found credible evidence against Tytler. But the government shrugged off the finding, saying it was not definite.

 Two FIRs were filed (Nos. 315 and 316 of 1984) at Bara Hindu Rao police station about the burning of Gurdwara Pul Bangash and the killing of Thakur Singh and Badal Singh, Sikhs in the area. 

 In neither, when the challans were filed, was Tytler included as an accused. While FIR 315 had 14 accused, FIR 316 had 31. 

 But witnesses later deposed before successive commissions and an independent Citizens Committee headed by Justice A.K. Sikri that Tytler had egged the mob on to attack the Sikhs and burn the gurdwara.

 Justice G.T. Nanavati cites these depositions to observe that the commission considers it safe to record a finding that there is credible evidence against Tytler.

 The Centres stand that there is no case against him gets nullified in view of the finding of the commission on record which has a stronger footing in law. 

 Of the 14 accused named in the first of two FIRs filed at Bara Hindu Rao, 13 were convicted and one was declared a proclaimed offender in 1997. The appeals of the convicts are pending. In the second FIR, all 31 accused were acquitted in 1992.

 In all such cases, only low-ranking policemen like ASIs or SIs, taxi drivers or local toughs have been convicted.

 None of the politicians who figure in the Nanavati report ever faced trial or were named by prosecution witnesses. But witnesses who deposed before various commissions pointed to their role. 

 In the case of Sajjan Kumar, a Congress MP, the FIR filed arrayed 27 persons as accused but not him. But the commission, relying on witnesses and other materials, held that there is credible material against Sajjan Kumar for recording a finding that he was involved in the crime. 

 On H.K.L Bhagat, the commission has said that owing to his condition (he is bedridden and is said to have lost sanity) no case need be pursued. But for all others, the commission has recommended action.

 If the government chooses, it can file a chargesheet after a probe. Although the recommendations are not binding, the commissions terms of reference say these are measures which may be adopted to meet the ends of justice.

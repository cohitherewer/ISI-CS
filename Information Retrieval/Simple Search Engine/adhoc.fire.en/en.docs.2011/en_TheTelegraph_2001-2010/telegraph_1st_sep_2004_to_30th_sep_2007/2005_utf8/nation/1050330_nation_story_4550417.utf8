 Bihar shuffle begins

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 29: The Bihar administration today transferred 16 senior IPS officers, triggering a speculation that the much-awaited bureaucratic shuffle after the imposition of President?s rule earlier this month would finally start.

 In effecting these transfers, the authorities seem to have broadly abided by the ?reverse logic? of replacing those posted in the ?field? with officers who have been ?habitually? stationed at the headquarters in the days of the Rashtriya Janata Dal government guided by Laloo Prasad Yadav.

 The transfers took place despite a Union home ministry ?directive?, which imposed restrictions on large-scale shifting, and the long delay in appointing advisers to Governor Buta Singh. Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam is playing the role of acting adviser at present.

 The chief secretary said on the directives of Patna High Court, the authorities have arrested around 15,000 absconders, including some dreaded criminals, who had arrest warrants pending against them. ?We will continue the drive,? Subramanyam said.

 The administration is also contemplating the formulation of an anti-crime law on the lines of the one in Maharashtra in a bid to provide more teeth to the police and improve the law and order situation in the state. Sources said the law would provide special powers to the police, including a provision of preventive detention and the authority to tap telephone lines, if necessary. 

 The modalities are yet to be made public.

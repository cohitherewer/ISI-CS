The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 BJP chief back in school

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karachi, June 4: L.K. Advanis hour-long stopover at St Patricks, where he studied from 1936 to 1942, was soaked in nostalgia.

 However, St Patricks is important for another reason. Its old boys list is a register of Pakistans whos who: President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, the late Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo and scholar-philosopher Jashan F. Vaswani, also known as Sadhu Vaswani.

 A notice board outside the principals office displays an article titled St Patricks Producing Prime Ministers and Presidents.

 St Patricks is Pakistans Doon School, a passport to success. Founded in 1861, it remains an elitist bastion and, unlike missionary schools in India, faces little or no competition from private entrepreneurs. The trajectory followed is A-levels from St Patricks, a degree from Oxford, Cambridge or the Ivy League, a career in the army or the bureaucracy and then politics.

 The principal, Father Joe Paul, stressed what it meant to be a Patrickan when he introduced the BJP chief ? at a function to felicitate Advani and his family ? as the second-most powerful person in the worlds second largest democracy.

 Advani told the gathering, which included classmates Danis Lopes, Simeon Periera and James D Souza, that when he first met Musharraf before the 2001 Agra summit, St Patricks kick-started the conversation. During Musharrafs recent visit, nearly 25 minutes of the 45 minutes they spent together were devoted to their alma mater.

 He asked me if I have any memories of that time. Those days, I remember it rained very little in Karachi, just four or five inches. Even a drizzle would occasion a holiday. But when it rained I always made it a point to come to school just to make sure the notice board said the school will remain closed, he said.

 Advani paid tribute to St Patricks, which he had visited in 1978 as I amp;B minister in the Janata Party government, and wound up his speech with a reference to Amartya Sen, who was anathema to the BJP because of statements he made on Ayodhya and Gujarat.

 These days, there is a lot of discussion and debate on what kind of economic strategy contributes to a countrys progress. I believe, as a Nobel laureate from our country said, that education and health are the ultimate indices to judge a countrys progress.

 Advani was welcomed by the school band, which played the Pakistan national anthem and school anthem, and was seen off to the tunes of Hes a jolly good fellow and Que, sera, sera, whatever will be, will be.

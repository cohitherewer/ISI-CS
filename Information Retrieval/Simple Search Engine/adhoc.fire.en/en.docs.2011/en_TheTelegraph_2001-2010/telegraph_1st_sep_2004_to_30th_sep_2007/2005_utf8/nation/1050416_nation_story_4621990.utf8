 SC grants time to medical council

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday 

 allowed the Medical Council of India (MCI) to file additional 

 documents for amending rules so that non-medical members 

 could be included in a state?s medical council, reports 

 our legal correspondent.

 A division bench of Justices P. Venkatarama Reddi and B.P. Singh also allowed state medical councils, various state governments and other parties to file their suggestions within four weeks. 

 A public interest litigation by Malay Ganguly, secretary of the Calcutta-based organisation, People for Better Treatment, sought directives from the apex court for drastic changes in the constitution of the MCI as well as the state medical councils. The organisation also called for implementing strict penal laws to bring to justice errant doctors in medical negligence cases.

 Nearly all the states and the Centre, besides the MCI and state medical councils, are parties in the case. 

 Compensation for torn pants

 New Delhi (PTI): When Bhim Singh bought 

 an expensive Allen Solly trouser to wear to his sister-in-law?s 

 wedding, it turned out to be a cause for embarrassment as 

 the garment tore at the party.

 The dealer agreed to replace the defective trouser. However, Singh sued the dealer, M/s Snow White, for not taking up the issue with the manufacturer. 

 A consumer court found this to be a ?deficiency of service? and ordered Rs 5,000 as compensation.

 ?It seems to be true that one of the trousers was defective as it got torn the very first day of being worn and the dealer did not bother to get this checked from the manufacturer, ? president of the district consumer disputes redressal forum (New Delhi wing), L.C. Jain, and members R.K. Manchanda and Janak Juneja said.

 ?One cannot expect the consumers to pursue the matter with the manufacturers when the goods have been returned to the dealer after they were found damaged,? the court said.

 The dealer argued that there had never been a complaint about the stitching or quality of the fabric earlier and the trousers, therefore, had torn as it was ?mishandled by the customer?.

 The court, however, said the ?trousers were purchased on April 12 and returned to them on April 19 which clearly shows that it could not have been damaged due to long usage?.

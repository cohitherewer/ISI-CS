 Death downpour

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, June 30: The army has been deployed for rescue operations in Gujarat as heavy rain continued to lash parts of the state, pushing the toll to 66 and snapping communication links.

 The state, in six days, has received 40 per cent of its average annual rainfall. According to the Met office, the downpour will continue for two more days. Vadodara recorded 365 mm of rainfall today. Kutch and northern parts of the state have, however, remained dry. 

 Army and disaster management teams have evacuated nearly 150,000 people from parts of south Gujarat. About 10,000 people were moved to safer places from Vadodara today as water levels kept rising in nearby Viswamitri and Wante rivers. Major parts of Surat, which suffers from perennial drainage problems, have been submerged as rainwater from surrounding areas flowed into the low-lying plains. 

 Thirty-one municipal schools have been turned into temporary shelter for over 20,000 people. 

 Over the last one week, more than 300 people, most of them from Surat, have been hospitalised following an outbreak of water-borne diseases.

 While over 6,000 villages in the state have no electricity, 36 villages in Bharuch and 25 in Navsari are cut off as road links have been disrupted due to waterlogging. Traffic on more than 500 routes, including two national highways, has been badly hit. National Highway 8 has been blocked for the last three days and movement through the Vadodara-Ahmedabad Expressway was stopped from today as rainwater did not subside. 

 Traffic on the Ahmedabad-Mumbai railway route has been disrupted due to flooding at Ranoli between Anand and Vadodara sections. Of the eight Mumbai-bound trains that left Ahmedabad this morning, only the Karnavati Express reached Vadodara, PTI reported. 

 Alerts were sounded in several places after 10 water reservoirs in Rajkot, nine in Surendranagar and the Shetrunji dam in Bhavnagar started overflowing. Ten dams in Junagarh district are also overflowing after heavy rain in the catchment areas. 

 The government has sought the Centres help to cope with the situation. Chief minister Narendra Modi had to abandon plans to undertake an aerial survey of the rain-affected areas today due to inclement weather.

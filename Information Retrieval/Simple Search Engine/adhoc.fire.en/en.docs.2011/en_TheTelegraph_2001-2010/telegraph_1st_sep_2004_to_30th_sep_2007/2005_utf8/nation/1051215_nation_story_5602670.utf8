The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pupils 300, teacher 1

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 14: After eight months of being taught by a single teacher, the 300 schoolchildren and their guardians had had enough.

 As soon as the school doors opened this morning, the pupils rang the bell that marks the end of classes, virtually dragged their Telugu teacher out and locked the doors. Then they hit the streets with their parents and neighbours, shouting slogans against the government for failing to appoint teachers to their zilla parishad high school.

 Some 25,000 of the states 9 lakh government schools do not have a single teacher and many more have just one, a recent survey has revealed. But remote, tribal-dominated Kanepalli, 350 km from Hyderabad, is probably the first to erupt into a mass protest against this.

 The village in Adilabad district, at the northern tip of Andhra Pradesh, is dominated by Gond tribals. As the children led the street protests with villagers, while some sat in dharna outside the closed school gates, they found support from their elders.

 Whats the point sitting in the classrooms without teachers? village head Ramaiah asked.

 The situation is roughly the same ? or worse ? in more than 250 schools in the district.

 At least, the students of Kanepalli are lucky that they have one teacher. Schools in the neighbouring villages dont have a single teacher, not even a peon, said a senior district official, R. Subba Rao.

 The villagers have threatened to hold education department officials hostage when they arrive the next time, unless they bring along a teacher or two. Our school should have had eight teachers but there has been only one for the past eight months. Last year, there were three, said Sarojakka, a parent.

 The nearest decent school is a walk of 6 km and the district residential school is about 30 km away.

 We had no alternative other than staging this demonstration and supporting the agitating children, said local sarpanch Kumaraiah, a Gond tribal.

 A district official said matters had got worse in the past year or so. The Congress governments move of abolishing the Telugu Desam regimes scheme of vidya volunteers has caused the vacuum, he claimed.

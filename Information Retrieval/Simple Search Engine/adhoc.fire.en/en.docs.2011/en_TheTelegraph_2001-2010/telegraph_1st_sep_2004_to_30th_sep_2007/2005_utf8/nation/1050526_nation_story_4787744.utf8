 Boost to defence ties with Beijing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 25: The chief of general staff of the Peoples Liberation Army of China, General Liang Guanglie, and heads of the Indian armed forces have proposed to widen military-to-military relations through bilateral exercises and exchanges of personnel.

 In the short term, the Chinese navy will be invited to participate in an exercise on Indias western seaboard. The Chinese army will also be invited to send a representative to an armoured exercise later in the year.

 General Liang Guanglie, who met defence minister Pranab Mukherjee this morning, made a number of proposals to further expand friendly cooperation between the two armed forces, a defence ministry release said. 

 Last month, India and China had signed a protocol to institutionalise confidence-building measures along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). 

 Under the protocol, each side informs the other of its military movements. Officially, there has been no exchange of fire along the LAC since 1967.

 In another meeting, Indias navy chief, who is also the chairman of the chiefs of staff committee, Admiral Arun Prakash, offered to conduct bilateral exercises with the Chinese fleet on Indias west coast. 

 In November 2003, the Indian Navy participated in the Search and Rescue Exercise with its Chinese counterpart off the coast of Shanghai. An Indian Army officer was also an observer at a military exercise in China in September last year.

 In his 30-minute meeting with General Liang, Mukherjee emphasised the need to take further the existing good relationship to a new height. 

 Defence ministry sources said General Liang and Mukherjee shared the view that the two sides and the armed forces must work to promote peace and tranquillity on the border and promote stability and development in Asia. 

 The two sides note that the Chinese generals visit follows the visit of the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, in April. 

 The military-to-military relations proposed to be charted flow from the agreements on strategic co-operation that were concluded and the protocol on military confidence-building measures along the LAC.

 Bus families pause in fear

 MUKHTAR AHMAD AND AGENCIES

Srinagar, April 2: Four militant groups today 

renewed their threat to kill those planning to take the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad 

bus, prompting second thoughts among some prospective passengers despite the army?s 

assurance that it would foil any attempt to disrupt the historic journey.

 ?My husband is still thinking whether to go to Muzaffarabad or not? If he is not able to go there, it will be a pity,? said the wife of Zainul Abidin Shah, hours after the rebels faxed their warning to local newspapers in Srinagar.

 In their statement, Al Nasreen, Al-Arifeen, Farzandan-e-Milat and the Save Kashmir Movement said they have ?complete computerised records of those intending to undertake the travel?. If the travellers did not heed the warning, they would have ?no option but to strike such families and their homes?.

 ?The intention of allowing the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service is to trade with the blood of thousands of martyrs who laid down their lives to end the Indian rule in Kashmir,? the statement said. ?Those undertaking the travel would be indulging in a luxury aimed at burying the Kashmir question for good.?

 The four separatist groups had earlier in the week warned Kashmiris not to travel on the bus, saying it was a ploy to sabotage ?Kashmir?s freedom struggle?.

 The rebels also said they had contacted some of those planning to make the journey and ?if they still decide to ignore the warning, we shall be attacking them and their homes?. They also renewed their call for a shutdown on April 7 when the bus service is to be flagged off here by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had yesterday assured the Assembly adequate security arrangements had been made for the passengers. 

 ?Only one person had received a threatening phone call made from England warning him against travelling by the Muzaffarabad-bound bus,? he said. ?The intending passenger told the caller that he was not afraid and would go ahead with his travel plan.?

 The army also reassured those planning to make the trip. ?We will foil the designs of the militants, as well as threats to the passengers of the Kashmir bus, which would be provided top security at all costs,? Nagrota-based 16 Corps commander Lieutenant General Sudhir Sharma said in Jammu. The army, Sharma added, has foiled such attempts in the past.

 But some families appeared to waver. Zamrooda, the daughter of Mohammad Abdullah Bhat who is to board the bus with his wife Fatima, said her parents were thinking whether to go ahead or not. ?The family is in a state of flux. We are not in a position to decide,? she said.

 Fatima, who wants to visit Muzaffarabad to see her married daughter, had earlier told a local newspaper the threats would not deter her.

 Bus too late

 A 105-year-old Kashmiri woman waiting to meet her brother ? one of the passengers from Muzaffarabad who was to reach Srinagar on April 7 ? after nearly 60 years, died yesterday following cardiac arrest, family sources said today.

 War games parade before the world

 GAUTAM DATT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: India is set to display its firepower before nearly hundred defence attaches from across the world.

 The India Armys open-up policy had been restricted to holding war games with foreign forces so far. Desert Strike, to be held in Rajasthan on Friday, will for the first time see a live demonstration of the countrys firepower capabilities. The event will also mark the first time China will be witness to war games on this side of the border.

 The Indian Air Force, too, is sending a component of its fighters and attack gunships that assist the army in pounding enemy territory with precision-guided bombs. 

 Defence attaches of around 100 countries, along with special observers from the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) of China, have been invited to witness the exercise.

 The lead in the confidence-building move between the neighbours was taken by China, when it invited Indian observers for a similar exercise in 2004.

 Indian military officials had crossed over to China to witness Iron Fist, the PLAs live ammunition exercise, held in the Queshan training base in Henan province. They were part of a group of observers from 60 foreign armies, including the Philippines, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, along with army chief General J.J. Singh and air force chief S.P. Tyagi, will be present during Desert Strike, slated to be held in the Pokhran field firing range near the international border.

 The notable absentee at Fridays war games will be the military representative of the Pakistan high commission, which has been kept out. A senior army official said the trust level between the two countries would have to be enhanced before opening up such serious military events for each other.

 US hardsells aircraft

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: US armaments major Lockheed Martin today offered to supply an aircraft for special missions to the Indian Air Force, expanding the list of products that it is hardselling to India.

 The C-27J Spartan built by Lockheed Martin with Alenia Aeronautica of Italy is touted to be the ?only military airlifter designed specifically for mid-sized missions, payloads and budgets and it can be used to airdrop troops, paratroopers and cargo?, Lockheed Martin?s India-based business developer, Michael N. Kelly, said here.

 The company has assessed that the IAF has projected the need for a squadron (about 10) of such aircraft and it is bidding for the order. The effort to sell the Spartan is in addition to the company?s pitch to sell the C-130J Super Hercules to the IAF. Kelly said the Spartan and the Hercules have much in common and that would reduce overhead costs. Lockheed Martin is also trying to win an order to sell an estimated 126 F-16 multirole combat aircraft to the IAF. 

 The Indian Navy is also in discussions with the US Navy on eight ?used and upgraded? P-3C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft manufactured by Lockheed. Kelly said four other countries had also evinced interest in the aircraft.

 Kelly said the IAF has sent a ?request for information? on the F-16 fighters that are the backbone of the US air force and are in use in 24 countries. Pakistan has also been trying to negotiate for F-16 from the US.

 Kelly added that companies like Lockheed Martin erect ?firewalls? within to check leakage of information on customers because often they were supplying to perceived adversaries, such as India and Pakistan. 

 He pointed out that Dassault Aviation of France had supplied Mirage aircraft to India and was also dealing with Pakistan, the Russians had sold the Sukhoi to India and China and ?historically we have had similar relations with Greece and Turkey?.

 An Indo-US security co-operation group meeting under the two countries? defence policy group is also expected to be held shortly to discuss confidentiality and future collaborations.

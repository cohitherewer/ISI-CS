 Violent election on CPML radar 

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Jan. 21: Recovering from the murder of its Jharkhand legislator Mahendra Prasad Singh, the CPI-ML today expressed fear that the Bihar elections too would be ?very bloody?.

 Party general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, just back from Singh?s funeral at Bagodar in Giridih, said the indications of the impending violence were already available on January 19 at Obra in Aurangabad district of central Bihar during an election meeting of RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav.

 ?In the presence of Laloo Prasad, local RJD leaders vowed to win the elections at any cost. They even said our MLA from Obra, Raja Ram Singh, would be ?dealt with? in every possible manner so that the seat goes to the RJD. We foresee a bloody election in Bihar,? the CPI-ML leader said.

 According to party state secretary Ram Jatan Sharma, the RJD leaders, including the mukhiya of Kanchanpur and the son of a former RJD minister, issued a ?warning? during the January 19 meeting. 

 ?They said ? ?Chahe khoon bahe, yeh seat is baar le lena hai (We will take this seat even if blood flows)?. This is not a positive indication,? Sharma said.

 The CPI-ML functionary said the party did not see any change in the situation on the ground to rule out violence during the elections. ?The Election Commission has made a lot of promises to ensure a peaceful poll. Such promises have been made in the past too but violence has rocked elections in the state. We will be surprised if these elections are any different,? he added.

 Bhattacharya said the ruling RJD, part of a scattered UPA in Bihar, was desperate to cling to power by any means. ?The inciting speeches were made in the presence of Laloo Prasad. That indicates the RJD?s desperation,? he added.

 The party has chosen to launch its election campaign from Arwal, which has a history of massacre. It will contest 33 seats in the first phase and has announced a list of 31 candidates for the second round.

 Bhattacharya said he welcomed the recent ?decision? of the Maoists not to target the CPI-ML cadre in Bihar. ?Our differences are ideological and violence should not be resorted to under any circumstances,? he added.

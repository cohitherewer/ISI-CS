 Dad fined for dumping child

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): A man has been fined Rs 5.25 lakh and socially boycotted on the charge of refusing to bring up his 2-year-old daughter.

 A community mahapanchayat met at Roorkali village near here on Sunday to decide the fate of the abandoned girl, Amrin, as her father, Javed, had failed to abide by its earlier order to look after her.

 Javed had divorced his wife when she was pregnant, refusing to accept the child as his own. The panchayat had granted the divorce on the condition that he brought up the child after one year. Both parents agreed and they had remarried. However, Javed did not honour the panchayats order as his new wife refused to adopt the child.

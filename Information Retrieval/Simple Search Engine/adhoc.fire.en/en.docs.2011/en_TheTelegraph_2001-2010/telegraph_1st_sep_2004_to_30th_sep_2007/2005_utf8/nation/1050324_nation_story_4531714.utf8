 Cong looks to ?reform? Left

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, March 23: The Congress has embarked on its toughest reform programme yet ? to get its key ally, the Left, to see its point of view.

 The move comes in the wake of the Congress?s successful behind-the-curtains engagement with the Left to get its support to pass the controversial patents bill in the Lok Sabha yesterday.

 The ruling party?s leadership is now more confident than ever about the United Progressive Alliance government?s ability to push forward some more politically contentious economic reform measures.

 The main UPA partner started speaking about bringing the Left parties round to supporting another controversial reform legislation ? the pension bill ? soon after the patents bill sailed through in the Lok Sabha with the latter?s endorsement.

 This, however, was done by accommodating most of the Left?s amendments.

 The Congress is willing to wait until the Left parties soften up again to support the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha last week and deferred today, though the BJP-led Opposition?s ?declared? support is available.

 ?Why should we hurry with the pension bill even though the BJP might be willing to extend support? The UPA government stands on the support of our outside partners. We will talk to them,? a senior Congress minister said.

 ?As in the case of the patents bill, we are confident of getting the Left endorsement later,? he added.

 Congress leaders, including ministers, said their party ?understands? the Left?s point of view. ?Our effort is to make them understand our point of view so that a common understanding evolves on any given issue,? a party leader said.

 He recalled how a similar effort had yielded the UPA?s common minimum programme last May.

 The Congress leaders believe the Left?s support to the patents legislation marked a significant development in the ruling coalition?s evolution into a stable and purposeful political entity.

 The Left overcame its tendency to occupy the Opposition space and supported the patents bill, which it had threatened to oppose almost until yesterday. Seemingly, the Left parties would have preferred a ?consensus? across Parliament?s political spectrum in support of the bill.

 As it kept negotiating with Left leaders, the Congress leadership made a consensus plea to the BJP for two consecutive days. But the rival party was wary of doing so and ending up vacating the Opposition space.

 The BJP leadership kept claiming it would vote against the bill until the Left parties decided to support the legislation. During the voting, the BJP-led NDA walked out rather than vote against the bill.

 Its threat to oppose the bill, however, helped the Congress persuade the Left to vote with the government so that the UPA could avoid the embarrassment of a defeat.

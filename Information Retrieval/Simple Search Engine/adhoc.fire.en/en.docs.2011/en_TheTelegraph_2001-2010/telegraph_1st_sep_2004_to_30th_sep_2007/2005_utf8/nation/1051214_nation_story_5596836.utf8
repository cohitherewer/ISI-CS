 Modi civic election hat-trick 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 13: There seems to be no stopping Narendra Modi in Gujarat. As in the first two rounds of local polls in October and November, the BJP has routed the Congress in the just-ended civic elections in five key municipalities.

 The states ruling party not only retained Vadodara, Surat, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar; it also wrested Rajkot, bagging 59 of the 69 seats. 

 Modi, who led the party campaign, fashioned huge victories in Surat (90-11), Jamnagar (37-9), Vadodara (77-6) and Bhavnagar (39-12).

 Leaderless and wracked by squabbles, the Congress had been banking on the anti-incumbency factor but that did not work. 

 The BJP had earlier captured the Ahmedabad corporation, 17 of the 23 district bodies and almost 80 per cent of all municipalities and talukas.

 The resounding victory will be enough to silence the chief ministers critics in Rajkot, Vadodara and Surat, Modis supporters say.

 Many of the dissident leaders, who have been questioning Modis autocratic style of functioning, are from these cities. They will now have to accept Modi as their undisputed leader or keep quiet for some time, a Modi aide said. The results suggest that people across the states villages, cities and towns have endorsed his development agenda.

 Senior Congress leader J.V. Momin blamed the rout on rampant factionalism.

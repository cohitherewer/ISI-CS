The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 24 in Bihar for JMM

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur, Jan. 10: The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) today said it will contest 24 Assembly seats in Bihar. 

 ?The JMM has decided to field candidates from those seats where the tribal population is sizeable,? the senior JMM leader and Jamshedpur MP Sunil Mahto said.

 According to him, the party believes that it stands a good chance of winning most of the 24 seats. ?We shall announce the names the candidates in due course,? Mahto said. 

 However, sources in the JMM told The Telegraph that the announcement was made in an attempt to exert pressure on the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) so that it does not bargain for more seats in Jharkhand. 

 ?Laloo Prasad Yadav is slated to meet the Congress high command to negotiate the number of seats it will contest in Jharkhand. But the JMM does not want the RJD to get more than what has been left for it,? a source said. 

 ?If Laloo Prasad agrees to what he has been given, we can also change our stand in Bihar and withdraw from some of the seats that we have earmarked to contest. But if he wants to get more seats in Jharkhand, the JMM too will stick to its stand of contesting 24 seats in Bihar,? a JMM leader said.

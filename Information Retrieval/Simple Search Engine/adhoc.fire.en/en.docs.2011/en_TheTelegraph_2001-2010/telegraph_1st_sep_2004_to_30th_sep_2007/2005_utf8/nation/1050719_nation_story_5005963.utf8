 Waste rap

 New Delhi, July 18: The Supreme Court today directed the chief commissioner, customs, of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust to file an affidavit on action taken against errant officials who allow dumping of tonnes of hazardous oil and chemical waste on Indian shores.

 The court took serious note of the alleged connivance of customs officials with importers and criticised their inaction. It also directed serving of contempt notices to all the polluters, who allegedly imported the wastes in huge shipping containers but left them on the shores. 

 Customs counsel Subba Rao told the court that the companies misdeclared the goods and in several cases the officials did not know the contents of the containers and could not find out who the offender was.

 Provogue owner quizzed in drug case

 Mumbai, July 1: Mumbai police have questioned the co-owner of the Provogue apparel brand, Salil Chaturvedi, in a drug-dealing case that threatens to rock the citys high society.

 In a statement, Chaturvedi confirmed that he was summoned by the police, but denied reports of involvement in the drug scandal.

 The Provogue promoter described these reports as false and misleading. 

 Chaturvedi said he was summoned for routine enquiry about Vishal Meghnani, a former employee who was arrested by Mumbai airport police on June 23 for his role in cocaine-dealing.

 The deputy commissioner of police, Shashikant Shinde, who is supervising the probe, said Meghnani was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Prevention) Act.

 In his confession, Meghnani provided information about his clientele and named places where the drug deals were cut, the police said. One of the places mentioned is Provogue Lounge, they added.

 The lounge is a popular night spot among Mumbais socialites. The showroom, located at Phoenix Mills in central Mumbai, doubles as a lounge-cum-fashion ramp at night.

 Senior police officials refused to confirm Provogue Lounge had been named but said Chaturvedi could be summoned again for questioning.

 Investigation into the case dates back to January when Allwyn Sequeira, manager of Provogue Lounge, was detained at Chennai airport for possessing a parcel containing white powder that proved to be cocaine on testing. 

 The parcel was meant for Meghnani, who was arrested and remanded in police custody till July 4.

 Meghnanis interrogation revealed sensational information about cocaine-dealing in Mumbai, according to police sources. The former Provogue employee has reportedly named a leading actor, a media personality known for flamboyance and at least three of Mumbais popular night spots as places where deals are struck.

 Actor Fardeen Khan, who is Provogues brand ambassador and hosts several big fashion shows, was himself in the middle of a drug scandal in 2001 when the Narcotics Control Bureau arrested him for possessing cocaine outside an ATM at Bandra. 

 The sleuths had caught Khan meeting a suspected cocaine peddler for whom they had laid a trap. The actor admitted later that he occasionally did use cocaine for relief from gruelling shooting schedules.

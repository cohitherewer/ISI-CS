 Allies at war over infotech turf

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 (Top) Gowda, Krishna: 

 IT tussle

 Bangalore, Oct. 18: Vokkaliga strongmen H.D. Deve Gowda and S.M. Krishna are locked in a war of words over the infotech industry that has catapulted this silicon hub to the world map.

 The reason for the spat between the two coalition allies is the Karnataka governments support for the industry.

 While Janata Dal (S) leader Gowda, a former Prime Minister, has opposed the proposed allotment of 845 acres on the citys outskirts for the industry, Krishna, who as a former Congress chief minister spurred the growth of the sector, spoke up on behalf of 1,500-odd companies here today.

 Krishna, now governor of Maharashtra, said if there are some shortcomings or doubts over use of land provided to IT companies, they can be clarified in a civilised manner and within four walls.

 I have no regret that I gave tremendous fillip to IT in our state?, he added.

 The JD (S) leader has criticised the IT industry, in particular Infosys Technologies, for pressurising the government over the allotment. These decisions should be taken with much caution because they will raise doubts in the minds of public, he said in a letter to chief minister Dharam Singh.

 Gowda also spoke of a whisper campaign by IT firms against the government on inadequate infrastructure in Bangalore. Some quarters in the IT sector are making concerted efforts to destabilise the coalition ministry, his letter said. The industry has declined to comment on his statements. An Infosys spokesperson, however, said chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy will respond to the charge after he returns from his overseas tour.

 The leaders ? from the dominant Vokkaliga community ? have also locked horns over corruption in government machinery during previous regimes (1999-2004 and 1994-99).

 Krishna, who was targeted by Gowda in the wake of remarks on corruption in a World Bank study on the climate for investments in the city, today asserted that the campaign against him would not dent his image.

 Regardless of how many man hours are spent in trying to tarnish my image, it would not work and dent my image. People of Karnataka know me better. Several programmes initiated by me when I was the chief minister have left a deep imprint in the minds of people. Yashaswini, a healthcare programme for farmers, is my brainchild, he said. 

 Krishna pointed out that on taking charge in 1999, he chose to concentrate on development and not to refer a legislature committee report on a Rs 400-crore deal during Gowdas regime to the CBI. The panel had recommended a probe into the deal, he said.

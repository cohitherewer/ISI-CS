 Mayavati hints at Goa rerun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Feb. 8: Mayavati today said there could be a rerun of the Goa scenario in Uttar Pradesh as she looked back in anger at her regime?s similar fate in 1997.

 ?This is a law of nature. Every action has its equal and opposite reaction,? the Bahujan Samaj Party leader said about Goa governor S.C. Jamir?s dismissal of the BJP government. Mayavati?s comments came in the light of the dismissal of her government after its then partner, the BJP, withdrew support in 1997.

 ?Where were these words of respecting democracy when my government was sacked and President?s rule imposed in the state in 1997?? Mayavati asked. The BSP leader was referring to BJP chief L.K. Advani?s accusation, at a sit-in in Delhi today, that the Congress violated democratic norms in Goa.

 Mayavati said BJP leaders should realise that they have to face the music now as they were party to a similar decision earlier.

 The BSP chief, however, said she was keeping a watch on the role of the Congress and the Uttar Pradesh governor regarding developments in the state. ?I have made an appeal to the governor (T.V. Rajeswar Rao). My party leaders met him and we hope he will do something about this government,? Mayavati said, accusing the Mulayam Singh Yadav government of trying to rule Uttar Pradesh by the power of the bullet.

 Mayavati said the second phase of her party?s agitation would start on March 31.

 The Congress said it would launch a stir against the Mulayam Singh regime on February 14.

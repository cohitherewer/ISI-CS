The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Parivar split on Advani attack

 OUR BUREAU

 June 15: Prodded by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and divisions in the Sangh parivar, the BJP has raised its voice against the VHP for demanding that L.K. Advani retire from politics.

 Senior vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu said the party can take decisions on its president and the VHP need not take any pains in this regard.

 The BJP decides who its president should be. We are a nationalist, democratic party and the party is capable of conducting its affairs, Naidu told a media conference in Chennai.

 He hailed Advanis contribution to the cause of Hinduism and nationalism as unparalleled.

 The BJPs decision to counter the VHPs attack was influenced not just by Vajpayee but by the perception that within the militant wing of the RSS, differences arose on whether an individual should be targeted.

 It is learnt that some of the influential religious heads in the Hardwar meet raised objections to the resolution that asked Advani to take sanyas.

 Acharya Avichal Das of Gujarat was quoted as saying that Advani spoke to Swami Vishesh Teerath of Udupis Pejawar Math this morning and refused to apologise for his remarks in Pakistan.

 The Udupi Swami is Uma Bhartis guru. BJP sources said the sadhvi ? who is trying to secure a foothold in the BJP after being out in the cold for months ? mediated after the VHP passed the anti-Advani resolution yesterday.

 The BJP chief reportedly told the swamiji that he said whatever he had to and wished to add nothing more.

 Avichal Das and Mahant Keshav Das of Ayodhyas Digambar Akhada ? the original seat of the Ram temple agitation ? declared that Advani could be forgiven if he worked for the interests of Hindus.

 Once the conciliatory noises started coming from the men in saffron, the hardcore elements in the VHP indicated that they could have a rethink on Advani.

 Statue showdown

 Eight hundred BJP workers led by four leaders courted arrest today in Rampur to protest the removal of Jan Sangh ideologue Deendayal Upadhyayas statue and vowed to carry on the agitation till it is restored to its original position.

 35 accused cleared of rape charge

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 20: Kerala High Court has reversed the conviction and sentence of all but one of 36 men accused of abducting and raping a schoolgirl over several days in 1996.

 A division bench of Justices K.A. Abdul Gafoor and R. Basant today ruled that the 35 defendants had consensual sex with the girl whose name was withheld.

 However, the bench sentenced Dharmarajan, a lawyer, to five years? rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 50,000, for confining the girl for 41 days and offering her to co-defendants. Dharmarajan would have to spend another year in prison if he fails to pay the fine.

 The case, known as the Suryanelli sex scandal, had raised a storm in Kerala. The CPM-led Opposition used the scandal ? in which Congress MP P.J. Kurian was sought to be implicated ? to beat its rivals with during the campaign for the 1997 Assembly elections. The Left government later gave Kurian a government job.

 The trial court had in September 2000 sentenced the 35 to rigorous imprisonment terms varying from four to 25 years and fines from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000 for rape, gangrape, kidnapping and conspiracy.

 Dharmarajan, who had gone into hiding, was picked up by police from a quarry in Karnataka and sent to jail for life in July 2002. However, the high court bench ruled today that the 35 defendants other than Dharmarajan were just customers and not involved in any other offence.

 The prosecutor submitted that the evidence should be judged on a different footing and evidence given by the victim should also be considered.

 However, the counsel for the defendants argued that the victim had not attempted to escape though she had travelled 4,000 km for days on end with the defendants.

 Contai/Delhi: Who is Suraj Jana?

 In the villages of East Midnapore, near Contai, Suraj is everyones jamai (son-in-law). The son of a retired primary school teacher at Dhandalibar is now the trusted emissary of the Jyoti Sai Group ? a registered placement agency ? who has promised scores of girls jobs in Delhi.

 In faraway Delhi, Suraj is nothing more than a dalal. A small cog in a dangerous wheel. The scrawny man is almost insignificant, with many more, just like him, working their way around the most vulnerable villages in the state, aiming for easy targets.

 Ami meye bechi (I sell girls), says a matter-of-fact Suraj, now in Delhi, explaining why there are cases against him, complaints filed back home by aggrieved parents, some of whom havent seen their daughters in years. 

 The short, thin man with a two-day stubble and bloodshot eyes denies the truth of the allegations. It is social service, he adds. Poor girl gets good job in big city and is saved from the clutches of poverty. But the Bhupati Nagar thana has sent a request to Delhi police to have him arrested and sent back to Calcutta.

 Tucked away in decrepit buildings, up narrow staircases stained with paan and reeking of urine, 750-1,000 agencies have set up shop in the capital, operating through a network of agents in villages, who bring children and young women, mainly between 12 and 25 years.

 Some are more formidable. Greenview Placement Agency, with a two-room office in south Delhis Shahpur Jat full of girls waiting to be chosen, has detailed registration forms for every girl. 

 Though it would seem above board, Nirmala Niketan, an NGO, recently rescued a girl placed in a home in Delhi. The girl was being abused and a neighbour complained, said Subhash Bhatnagar. They found that she had been told her mother had died, which was not true. They managed to track her down, and found that the mother, too, had been told that the daughter had died. 

 Girls from Bengal ? along with Nepal, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa ? are offered by just about all agencies. Most officially deny bringing in girls below 18. 

 Like the Geeta Thapa Agency, specialising in girls from Nepal and Bengal. The police verify the identities of all of the girls, so we make sure their papers are in order, says Geeta, the Nepalese woman who started the business along with her husband. 

 Monalisa from Calcutta, hanging around outside Geetas tiny office, tells another tale. My husband is bringing in two girls from Calcutta today. They are around 12 or 13 years. They will be perfect for you, she smiles.

 Once they reach Delhi, some of the girls disappear. Other cases of abuse and exploitation are reported. We see a number of children in domestic labour who are abused, says Bharti Sharma, chairperson of the Delhi Child Welfare Committee. 

 The girls are found sometimes when they run away or when concerned neighbours intervene. The agents, however, are difficult to pin down. They are very clever and all claim that they are doing a great service to society.

 Delhi police, spurred by a spate of cases involving domestic helps, have been running regular checks at the placement agencies. Suraj and his five cronies, for instance, who all freelance with the Jyoti Sai Group at Chirag in south Delhi, were rounded up recently by personnel from the Malviya Nagar thana.

 It doesnt matter. We were late in paying our monthly Rs 2,000 to the police, so they decided to crack down, explains owner Bimlaji, in whose clutches many of the returned girls claim they have faced abuse. 

 They are already back in business. The day the police come to close her office down she is in Punjab, recruiting more girls, and her daughter Jyoti takes care of business. When she returns, the middle-aged woman claims she has struck Suraj off the rolls ? he owes the girls up to Rs 3 lakh, she alleges. That is the salaries he was supposed to send home.

 Shanti Nurses Bureau, also owned by Bimlaji, has a visiting card that promises joyful, yielding, outstanding telented (sic), intelligent help for private duties at home, hospital, nursing home. 

 For Shikharani, however, the experience has been anything but joyful. She was taken to Jaipur. When we lodged a police diary against him, Suraj took her to his home in Delhi and threatened her, says mother Sandhyarani.

 Suraj also took Ashtami, 13, and Basanti, 16, to Delhi some years ago. That was the last their mother Arati Sheet heard from Basanti. By the time Ashtami was extracted from the agencys clutches, she was, according to her family, black and blue. She is now working in Calcutta, closer home, and hopefully less at risk.

 If Suraj is caught, he should be killed. One murder for another, says Arati, one of three wives who doesnt know precisely how many children she has or what has become of Basanti. What she does know is fear.

 Her son Buddhadeb was beaten up, allegedly by Surajs thugs, who are spreading word that Arati sold her daughter and is trying to cover it up. Now, with the case gaining momentum back home, families are receiving threat calls. Dont complain or else?

 A handful of angry villagers may now be speaking out, but the unending flow shows little signs of slowing.

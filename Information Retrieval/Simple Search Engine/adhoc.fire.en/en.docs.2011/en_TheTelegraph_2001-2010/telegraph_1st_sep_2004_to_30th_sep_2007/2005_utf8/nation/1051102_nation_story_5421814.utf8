The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Scramble for slice of minority vote

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Laloo Prasad

 Phulwari Sharif (Bihar), Nov. 1: With the BJP threat reduced after the Lok Sabha elections, Muslims in Bihar are willing to consider parties other than the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Sensing an opportunity, the various political alliances in this staggered Assembly election have practically laid siege to the states Islamic centres.

 The campaign to win over the community gets more intense by the day. So does the debate among Muslims: is Laloo Prasad Yadavs utter lack of performance over the past 15 years reason enough to back a BJP-backed combination?

 Imarat-e-Shariat, based in Phulwari Sharif near Patna, is the most important Islamic centre in northern India apart from the Deoband seminary in Uttar Pradesh. It runs over 40 dar-ul-qazas (Shariat courts), hospitals and schools for the community. It also mobilises Muslim support for political parties by issuing fatwas and messages during elections.

 During the Lok Sabha elections, the Imarat-e-Shariat had asked the community to vote for Laloo Prasad, thus ensuring a rout for the BJP. But since then, the situation has changed. The Muslims here do not mind considering other possibilities provided the BJP does not pose any immediate danger.

 The various parties, therefore, made a beeline for Imarat-e-Shariat after the elections were announced. Nitish Kumar came here. So did Ram Vilas Paswan. Laloo Prasad ? dropping his past arrogance, which came from the belief that the Muslims had no choice but to support him ? also came knocking.

 It is true that the Muslims have not supported Lalooji in the Assembly elections (so far) the way they had during the Lok Sabha polls. But the circumstances are now different, said Maulana Anisur Rehman Qazmi, general secretary, Imarat-e-Shariat.

 There are (other) options that may seem secular ? though we still believe that no one has proved it (secular credentials) better than Lalooji. Nitish Kumar was, after all, the railway minister when Godhra happened. What did he do? Had he acted in time, the Gujarat riots would not have happened. People understand this.

 But Qazmi also conceded: The Gujarat riots are not an issue any more. The real debate is: how strongly do you feel about Laloojis rule during the last 15 years.

 He, however, believes that if Laloo Prasad projects himself ? rather than Rabri Devi ? as the chief minister, the results would be far more favourable for him.

 Paswan has declared that all backward Muslims will support him this time. They have seen Laloo for 15 years. What has he done for them? They are among the poorest people in the country. Simply ensuring a riot-free state is not enough. It is your job anyway. What next? What about their aspirations? Paswan said.

 Others believe that the Muslim voting pattern would vary across the state. According to social scientist Shaibal Gupta, Laloo Prasad stands a better chance of getting their full support in areas where they are in a minority. 

 But in Muslim majority areas, they might consider other possibilities, Gupta said.

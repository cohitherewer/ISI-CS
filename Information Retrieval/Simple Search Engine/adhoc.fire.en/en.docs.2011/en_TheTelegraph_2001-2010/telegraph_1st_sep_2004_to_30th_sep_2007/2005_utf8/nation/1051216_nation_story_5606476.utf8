 SC relook at rape order

 New Delhi, Dec. 15 (PTI): Prompted by a daughter who changed her deposition against her father, the Supreme Court today reopened a case in which it had sentenced the 75-year-old man to life in jail for sexually assaulting her 17 years ago.

 Justices H.K. Sema and P.P. Naolekar took on record the daughters affidavit and decided to re-examine its November 17 verdict that not only set aside Asha Rams acquittal by Himachal Pradesh High Court but had also increased the five-year prison term handed down by a trial court.

 After the apex courts verdict, Asha Ram had filed a review petition along with his daughters affidavit. The affidavit claimed that her father did not rape her and the FIR was lodged at the instance of her mother, Asha Rams estranged wife. The daughter, allegedly raped on the intervening night of August 28-29, 1988, when she was a minor, said the evidence in the case was fabricated and she was not at her fathers place on that night.

 My father was innocent and he did not rape me and the case was falsely lodged against him, and I also deposed against my father in the court of additional sessions judge, Shimla, at the instance of my mother and police. If I had not deposed at the time against my father, my mother would have harmed me along with police, said the affidavit by the now married mother of two.

 In his review petition, Asha Ram, who stayed in the servants quarters attached to the Shimla Raj Bhavan, had contended that the apex court was not correct in enhancing his jail term as there was no appeal in the high court by the state government against the trial courts order.

 In its verdict, the apex court had observed that when the perpetrator of the crime is the father against his own daughter it is more rarest of rare, which warrants deterrent judicial hand.

 Sangh gives Advani a say on successor

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is prepared to listen to L.K. Advanis views on who should replace him after he resigns as party president in December.

 The Sangh, which had forced Advani to promise to quit before the end of his term, has already begun discussions with the BJP brass on his successor. Advani himself is likely to meet top Sangh leaders K.S. Sudarshan and Mohan Bhagwat on November 18.

 Former BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu briefly met sarsanghchalak Sudarshan this morning before going into a long huddle with Bhagwat. Though Naidu insisted that the talks centred on relief work in Kashmirs earthquake-ravaged areas, Sangh sources said the two leaders also discussed other important issues.

 The Sangh seems to have called a ceasefire after a feud with Advani over his controversial remarks on Mohammed Ali Jinnah ? the primary reason why he is having to quit the party presidents post. Sudarshan wished the BJP leader on his birthday and also called to exchange Diwali greetings. 

 Its becoming increasingly obvious that after having had its way by showing Advani the door, the Sangh is ready to involve him in the consultations about his successor.

 Advani is very close to the RSS even today. He expressed certain views on Mohammed Ali Jinnah in Pakistan. We conveyed our reservation on that. The matter ended there itself. Relations with the BJP continue to remain same as before, Sangh spokesman Ram Madhav had said last week.

 The issue of Advanis successor has been one of the hottest topics of debate in the BJP in recent months. Though there are reports that an interim arrangement may be found after Advani goes, Sangh sources said such a scenario was highly unlikely.

 While the Sangh insists on collective leadership within the BJP, it is likely that there will be a first among equals.

 The collective leadership formula would involve changes in the BJPs constitution to make way for general secretaries being elected along with the president instead of being hand-picked by him. This would make the general secretaries powerful in their own right and act as a check on the powers of the president.

 The Sangh wants the BJP to evolve this system because it thinks the current constitution had allowed leaders like A.B. Vajpayee and Advani to become too powerful. They had denied the Sangh the chance to run the show in the BJP as freely as it would have liked to.

 But this in no way means the Sangh will not place its favourite in the top post. Among the second-rung leaders, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Rajnath Singh is fast emerging as the front-runner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Elimination round kicks off

 Chennai, Sept. 18: L.K. Advanis announcement of his decision to demit office as the BJP president has set in motion the speculation on who could succeed him, even though a little over three months remain for the succession to happen. 

 Until yesterday, Advanis acolytes had proposed to the RSS, through the general secretary (organisation), Sanjay Joshi, that a presidium could run the BJP until it was time for the next poll. This presidium would have three members ? M. Venkaiah Naidu, Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley. 

 The idea was since the three are known as Advani loyalists, it would enable him to continue having a say in party matters, if not exercise surrogate control. 

 The technical argument was since the BJP chief has a three-year term ? which neither Advani nor his predecessors Naidu and K. Jana Krishnamurthy could complete ? Advanis successor will assume charge mid-way and be denied a full tenure. Knowledge of this could make him seem a lame duck president in the cadres eyes. So, it was more tenable for the presidium to keep things going until 2007 (when Advanis term would normally have ended) and then elect a new president.

 The RSS, which monitored the Chennai happenings with a microscope, reportedly shot down the idea and insisted that a new president will be in place on December 30, when Advani is expected to step down. 

 Sources admitted that as the Sangh will have a veto power, the process of elimination has got underway, with the first list deleting the names of the RSSs bete noires. The names of Jaswant Singh, Naidu and Mahajan figured in it.

 While the Sangh reportedly had no problem with Jaitley, the sources said it was doubtful if he would be up to the job after his recent bypass surgery. Specially since he had his legal practice on hand as well.

 The sources said the Sanghs choice had narrowed down to three persons: Murli Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj and Rajnath Singh and in the reverse order.

 Rajnath, because it felt his uncontroversial image, Hindi heartland roots and an unquestioned loyalty to the Sangh were assets at a time when Advani seemed set to take on the RSS. The fact that the BJP was down and out in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar was noted when Rajnaths name was mentioned. A Thakur from Uttar Pradesh, he is reportedly being backed by fellow Thakur and Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.

 Rajnaths perceived lack of articulation and an inability to get the big picture on politics and contemporary issues were more than made up for by Sushma, said the sources. She reportedly distanced herself from the Advani group during the recent crisis and stayed neutral in order to get into the Sanghs good books.

 Sushma, always an RSS favourite, was briefly out of favour when the RSS suspected she had misrepresented certain events during the Jinnah crisis.

 As for Joshi, the sources were doubtful if his public show of affinity towards RSS boss K.S. Sudarshan ? they travelled together from Nagpur to Chennai last week ? would help him score brownie points. 

 The general view was that his overt Brahminism and sense of aloofness from the rank and file may not make him the most effective leader of the BJP at a time when a lack of workers connectivity was identified as the biggest problem area.

 The sources said the power sweepstakes may end in a toss-up between Rajnath and Sushma.

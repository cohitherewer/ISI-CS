 Cop respite for Salem

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 29: The designated anti-terror court today cut down the number of police officers interrogating Abu Salem from five to two after his complaints of restlessness in the presence of too many cops.

 Heeding the plea of Salems advocates that the police were torturing him in custody, designated terror court judge P.V. Bavkar asked the police to produce Salem in court today.

 The judge spoke to Salem in private for 20 minutes after the don showed his reluctance to speak in public.

 When the judge asked him if he was being provided proper food, Salem said yes. When asked if he was being treated properly by the police, Salem, whose face looked slightly swollen, did not reply and hung his head.

 The judge said he would record Salems statement but not in the presence of either the police or his lawyers.

 Later, Bavkar spoke to Datta Dhawle, the investigating officer of the anti-terror squad team questioning the don, and said Salem was feeling restless for being questioned by too many officers. He said two officers were enough to question Salem and that Dhawle, an ACP, and inspector Sunil Deshmukh would be retained.

 After the CBI questioned Salem in connection with the 1993 Bombay blasts, he was put in police custody for interrogation in connection with the murder of builder Pradeep Jain. 

 Salem is lodged at the Bhoiwada police station lock-up in Wadala.

 Yesterday, Salems lawyers lodged a complaint with the Maharashtra Human Rights Commission alleging that he was being tortured. 

 Salems lawyer Ashok Sarogi added that lawyer Harjot Singh, who defended Salem in Portugal, is still abroad because Salems defence is planning to move his case back to Portugal.

 Jagat offers to be probed

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: In his faded T-shirt and crew-cut hair, Jagat Singh, 38, looks rather like an overgrown college boy.

 This is his first meeting with a journalist since Iraqgate broke and cost his father Natwar Singh his job as foreign minister; so he is understandably nervous.

 Hi, I am Jagat, says a small voice as a long, gangling arm is extended for a handshake.

 Jagat had been holding his silence under orders after allegations appeared in the media that his father benefited from oil allocations made by the erstwhile Saddam Hussein regime, which received kickbacks in return. Hamadan Exports, the company of his friend Andaleeb (Andy) Sehgal, was said to be involved in the deal.

 We were advised to keep quiet but the rumour mills had started working and done damage.

 He says in answer to a question: No, I have not been questioned by the enforcement directorate nor has my passport been impounded. In fact, I would like to be investigated and quickly. I want to clear my name and my fathers name as soon as possible.

 Suddenly, he sounds vehement. I do believe we have been framed. I am no expert on foreign policy but I do believe there are many global lobbies who stand to benefit with Natwar Singh out of the way, says the MLA from Lakshmangarh, a family pocketborough in Rajasthan.

 My name does not figure in any report and my father Natwar Singhs name was not there in any of the initial reports. The first report on the issue, in the Arabic newspaper al-Mada in January 2004, does not have Natwar Singhs name.

 Nor does the interim report produced by the Volcker Committee and submitted to a US House of Representatives committee in February 2005 have his name. It had, before the interim report came out, suddenly surfaced in a report by the CIA-funded Iraq Survey Group as Natora Singh in September 2004, and then flashed up again in the final Volcker report. Isnt that mysterious? asks Jagat.

 And if you see the Iraq Survey Group report (The Telegraph has a copy), all US citizens and companies names have been blacked out. Instead, there are entries (saying) US person, US company.

 His decision to end his silence, he says, is his own, though it was made after consulting friends.

 After my former wife Natasha expired, I went through a lot because I kept quiet. The crime branch investigated me for one whole year. An NDA government was in power and there were attempts to implicate me by turning it into a murder case. Two autopsies were done ? one was ordered as we were taking her for cremation. I ultimately came out of it all, but after taking a lot of flak simply because I chose to stay quiet in my moment of grief.

 Jagats estranged wife, Indo-Jordanian photographer Natasha Masary, had killed herself a few years ago. Some reports had suggested he was to blame for it. Jagat has not married again and his two sons keep flitting in and out ? to tell him, for instance, about the cricket shot that just crossed the Teen Murti Lane bungalows walls.

 His friend, Andy Sehgal who has married into the family, crops up in the conversation. Sehgal has been named by Volcker for having paid illegal surcharge against oil coupons allotted by Iraq.

 I know him, we go back a long way ? from college, long before he married my second cousin ? but believe me, I have never done any business with him, Jagat says. Whether Andy did any oil deals is something he will discuss with investigators.

 Did he himself go to Iraq? Yes, twice.

 The first time was in 2001 as part of a Congress delegation where I represented the Youth Congress, of which I was a general secretary. You have to remember Iraq supported us during the 1971 war and was among the very few which supported Indiraji when she declared Emergency. The Congress has always had good relations with the Baath party ? all said and done, both were secular and socialist.

 The second time was again in 2001, when he was sent by the Youth Congress to attend a global conference against the UN sanctions.

 Andaleeb was there in Iraq when we went on the first visit. He had been getting himself registered with various Iraqi ministries to try (and) supply foodgrain. I dont think he was very successful. We met at a party hosted by the Indian ambassador.

 I have learnt ? from now on, I shall always check who are on the flight I travel by, who are there in the city to which I travel.... Life is tough, Jagat says with a rueful smile. 

 Lots of people are trying to put two and two together and work out that I had something to do with his business. I cant blame them all. Prima facie it looks (as if) something is wrong. His name is in a report and he is a friend and relative.

 Jagat shows us out through his sons rooms, which have photographs of the hauntingly beautiful Natasha hanging from the walls.

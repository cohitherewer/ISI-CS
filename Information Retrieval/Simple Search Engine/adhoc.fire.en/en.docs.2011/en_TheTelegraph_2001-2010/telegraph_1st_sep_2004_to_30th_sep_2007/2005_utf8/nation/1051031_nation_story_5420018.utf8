 PM shield for Natwar

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: The Prime Minister today defended K. Natwar Singh against the charge of being one of the non-contractual beneficiaries of Iraqs oil-for-food programme during Saddam Husseins reign.

 Manmohan Singh made it clear that the facts mentioned in the UN probe report are insufficient and one cannot draw any adverse conclusion against the foreign minister from them.

 The Prime Ministers defence will be a morale-booster for Natwar. The Congress, which, too, has been tainted with the same brush by the UN report, has so far not offered much of a defence for the foreign minister.

 Many had seen the partys reaction yesterday ? when it said individuals were competent to defend themselves ? as an attempt to distance itself from the foreign minister. But the Prime Ministers public statement has sent out a signal that Natwar is not being abandoned in his hour of crisis.

 The foreign minister, who returned from Moscow last night, held a closed-door meeting with the Prime Minister.

 Natwar Singh categorically denied any involvement in the alleged illicit payments on oil transactions under the oil-for-food programme, as stated by the UN independent inquiry, the Volcker Committee report, the Prime Ministers media adviser, Sanjay Baru, told reporters.

 The Prime Minister agreed that the facts mentioned in table-3 of the report of the independent inquiry committee are insufficient to arrive at any adverse conclusion against the foreign minister and stands by him.

 Natwar had already denied the allegation. I am deeply shocked and outraged by these allegations which are baseless and untrue, he had said in a statement from Frankfurt yesterday before he boarded his flight to India.

 Many believe that Natwar is perhaps being singled out from the long list of alleged beneficiaries because of Indias stand on Iran. The foreign ministers visit to Tehran in September had raised concerns in Washington about the growing India-Iran ties. 

 Volckers allegation about him came out a day after he met the Iranian Vice-President in Moscow and stressed that Delhi would like the controversy over Tehrans nuclear programme sorted out in the International Atomic Energy Agency rather than the UN Security Council.

 Although Washington hasnt officially reacted to the Moscow meeting, indications are the Bush administration may not be too happy with it or with Natwars comments.

 But if the foreign minister has to prove his innocence and link the disclosure of Volckers charge with Indias stand on Iran, he needs the Lefts support.

 The Left today demanded a probe into the allegations. It should be noted in this context that the US and other Western countries who were instrumental in imposing the brutal sanctions for 11 years are biased against all those who had dealings with the then iraqi government, a statement issued by the CPM added.

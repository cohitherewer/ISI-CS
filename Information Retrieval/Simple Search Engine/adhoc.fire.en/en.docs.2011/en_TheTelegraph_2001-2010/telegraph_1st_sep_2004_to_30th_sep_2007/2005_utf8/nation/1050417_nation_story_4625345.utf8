 Hurriyat moderates carry Kashmir voice

 ALOKE TIKKU

New Delhi, April 16: When Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf meets Hurriyat leaders, one of them intends to make sure that the general carries the voice of 15 lakh Kashmiris back home to Islamabad.

 Musharraf will be given a pack of compact discs that Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chief Yasin Malik believes contain the voice of the Kashmiris that the separatists are trying to make Delhi and Islamabad listen to.

 The discs are the result of a signature campaign launched two years ago to urge India and Pakistan to ?actively involve? the Kashmiris ?in the process relating to resolution of the Kashmir dispute?.

 ?There are 37 discs containing one lakh photographs of signatures of the Kashmiri people seeking their involvement in the resolution of the dispute,? said Malik, who will meet Musharraf along with another separatist leader Shabir Shah tomorrow evening.

 Leaders of the divided Hurriyat Conference ? the moderate faction led by Mirwaiz Omar Farooq and hawk S.A.S. Geelani ? will meet the Pakistan President separately and make the same point.

 A Hurriyat leader said the Geelani faction would try to send across a message claiming that it is the ?true representative? of the Kashmiris.

 Geelani is learnt to be particularly unhappy at Islamabad giving too much importance to the moderate faction and is expected to hint at his concerns on the Kashmiri leadership issue. 

 Geelani had recently kept away from the Pakistan Day reception to make his displeasure known at the way he was being treated by Islamabad.

 The acting chairman of the moderate Hurriyat, Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, is said to have cleared the air at a one-to-one, unpublicised meeting with Musharraf last year.

 The Mirwaiz has supported the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service but emphasised that the Kashmiris had not sacrificed their lives just for a bus service or a handful of confidence-building measures.

 ?We want resolution of the Kashmir issue,? he had declared after the bus service was launched. In Delhi, the Hurriyat leader said the moderates would seek the involvement of the Kashmiris in the peace process before India and Pakistan take a big step forward.

 There are, however, indications that a meeting between the Hurriyat and the Prime Minister may not come through despite Manmohan Singh?s recent statement expressing his willingness to meet them.

 The government is not entirely convinced that the Hurriyat leaders really wanted to meet Singh. Some officials believe that the Hurriyat spoke of meeting the Prime Minister to ensure that they were not accused of being Pakistan?s stooge.

 Reports of the PoK-based Hizb-ul Mujahidin chief Syed Salauddin expressing his willingness to come to India to talk peace are also expected to dent the importance of the Hurriyat in Delhi?s scheme of things.

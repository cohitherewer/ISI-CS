 ?Neglect? doctors back in glare

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 8: The Supreme Court today asked Dr Kunal Saha to file his counter-reply in a medical negligence case, putting the focus back on a judgment that physicians are not criminally liable in such instances.

 The court gave Saha eight weeks to respond to the replies that Calcutta physicians Baidyanath Haldar, Sukumar Mukherjee and Abani Roy Chowdhury gave in response to apex court notices.

 Saha has to give his reasons why it should uphold the Alipore trial court?s conviction of the doctors and set aside their acquittal by Calcutta High Court.

 The three were charged with ?criminal negligence? under IPC Section 304A for allegedly causing the death of Saha?s wife, US-based Dr Anuradha Saha, during her visit to India in May 1998.

 The trial court had found Mukherjee, cricket captain Sourav Ganguly?s personal physician, and Haldar guilty and sentenced them to three months? rigorous imprisonment ? a first in India?s medico-legal history.

 Justice G.C. De of the high court reversed the ruling and acquitted all three on March 19, 2004. Roy Chowdhury had earlier been cleared by the trial court. Malay Ganguly, Saha?s brother-in-law, challenged the acquittal in a special leave petition before the Supreme Court. On October 11, 2004, the apex court issued notices to all three doctors.

 Haldar?s lawyer R.K. Jain, a former Supreme Court Bar Association president, argued that Saha was ?in fact a student of Dr Haldar?.

 Justice P.K. Balasubramaniyan of the bench quipped: ?This is perhaps the gurudakshina he (Saha) wants to give (to Haldar)?.

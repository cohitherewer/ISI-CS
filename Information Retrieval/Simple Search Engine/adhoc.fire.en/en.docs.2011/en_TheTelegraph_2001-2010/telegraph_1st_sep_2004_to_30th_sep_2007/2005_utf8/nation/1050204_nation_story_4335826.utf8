 BSP case

 New Delhi, Feb.3: Slain Bahujan Samajwadi Party MLA Raju Pal?s murder case took another legal turn today with the Supreme Court issuing notices to the Uttar Pradesh government on a petition by Pal?s wife that the case be handed to an independent agency, reports our legal correspondent. 

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha also issued notices to the CBI and Samajwadi Party MP Atiq Ahmed and his brother Ashraf Ahmed (the two have been arrested on murder charges in the case). 

 The petitioner, Pooja Pal, apprehended a threat to her and her mother-in-law?s life from the Samajwadi Party. She sought court protection following which the apex court directed the state police to provide them security.

 Pal alleged that her husband?s death was a political murder carried out at the behest of the ruling party and claimed that the police investigation was not fair and impartial.

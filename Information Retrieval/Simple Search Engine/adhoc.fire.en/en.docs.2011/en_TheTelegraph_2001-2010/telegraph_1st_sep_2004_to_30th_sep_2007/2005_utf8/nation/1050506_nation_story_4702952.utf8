The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The end of foreign origin

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 5: Six years ago, Sonia Gandhis foreign origin had prompted Sharad Pawar, Tariq Anwar and P.A. Sangma to break away from the Congress and float the Nationalist Congress Party.

 Today, the same NCP has decided to invite Sonia to address the inaugural of the partys foundation day national convention in Surat on June 10. 

 Last May, when the United Progressive Alliance government was being formed, there was speculation that the NCP would return to the Congress. Pawar decided to join the government, that too when everyone was convinced that Sonia would be the Prime Minister. 

 Perhaps, as an afterthought, the NCP found it fit to offer an explanation on why it allied with the Congress. Party leaders said as Manmohan Singh was heading the government, the partys foreign origin plank was no longer an issue. 

 The foreign origin plank had become ?irrelevant? after the 2002 Gujarat riots, NCP chief spokesman D.P. Tripathi said today. ?The riots fundamentally altered the context of national politics for the NCP? and necessitated that secular and democratic forces should come together, he said. 

 Tripathi said the decision to invite Sonia was in line with the coalition spirit. ?The 2004 verdict is to strengthen secular and democratic forces. In that spirit we are inviting Sonia. Our party president will shortly write to the UPA chairperson and Congress president?? he added. 

 Sangma, who had rebelled against Pawars decision to align with the Congress after the general elections, will also attend the convention. 

 A Congress functionary said the decision on Pawars invitation would be taken once Sonia receives it.

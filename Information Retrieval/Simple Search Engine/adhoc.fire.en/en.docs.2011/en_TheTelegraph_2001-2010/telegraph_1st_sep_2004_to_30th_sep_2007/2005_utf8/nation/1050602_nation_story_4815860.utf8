 Cinemas slash ticket rates for survival

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, June 1: Ticket prices in Andhra cinema halls will be slashed from tomorrow in a booster dose to the ailing Tollywood.

 The highest priced ticket will cost Rs 40 and the lowest Rs 10. Earlier, they used to cost Rs 75 and Rs 25 respectively.

 The idea behind the slash is to rationalise the tax burden on the industry that is reeling from the onslaught of pirated videos and CDs. Easy availability of these means viewers prefer watching films at home for cheap instead of flocking to cinema halls.

 The slab system introduced by the former Desam regime ? in which tax was predetermined by the number of seats and a fixed amount would have to be paid irrespective of ticket sales ? will be done away with. Distributors will now have to pay only as much tax as they sell tickets.

 To draw more people, the government is also making it mandatory for hall owners to increase low-priced tickets to 20 per cent of the total seats. Earlier, it was as low as 10 per cent. Theatre owners have, however, been allowed to charge an extra rupee for air-conditioning.

 Each of us must implement the measures as they are the only way we would be saved from further doom, said G. Adisheshagiri Rao, chairman of the Andhra Pradesh Theatre, Film and TV Development Corporation.

 The government has also tightened laws to contain video piracy under which those found indulging in the malpractice would have to undergo three years rigorous imprisonment. A task force has also been set up.

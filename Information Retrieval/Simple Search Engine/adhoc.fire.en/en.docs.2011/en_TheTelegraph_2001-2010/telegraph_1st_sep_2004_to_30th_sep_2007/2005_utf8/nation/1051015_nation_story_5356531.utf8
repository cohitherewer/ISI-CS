 Atal stands up for Sangh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: The RSS has got a fillip from Atal Bihari Vajpayee in its battle against L.K. Advani. 

 Asked to comment on Advanis views about interference by the RSS, Vajpayee stressed it does not interfere in the BJPs affairs.

 Sangh hastakshep nahin karta (the Sangh does not interfere), the former Prime Minister said on the sidelines of a book release today. There is no question of RSS interference, he repeated when asked if the Sangh denied the BJP its functional autonomy.

 Vajpayees views were construed by sections of the RSS as the leg-up it needed after the BJP president attacked it in his concluding speech at the partys Chennai national executive and demanded an open debate on BJP-RSS relations. 

 Sources close to Advani said his speech was vetted and cleared by Vajpayee before being released. The claim was refuted by the former Prime Ministers aides who said it was shown to him minutes before being read out.

 Advani secured unexpected support recently from Uma Bharti who, in a letter to RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan, had accused senior Sangh functionary Suresh Soni of scuttling her return to Madhya Pradesh as chief minister. 

 Asked to comment on general secretary Pramod Mahajans views on the need for collective leadership to restore discipline in the BJP, Vajpayee replied: We welcome everyones suggestions. 

 Mahajan had articulated this opinion reportedly as a response to a decision taken by Advani, Vajpayee and Jaswant Singh to replace Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur with Uma this month. 

 The second-rung leadership of the BJP stood as one in opposing this proposal.

 To a question on the problems within the BJP, Vajpayee said: Everything will be sorted out, dont worry.

 With Vajpayee apparently leaving Advani to battle it out solo, it appears that the party chiefs desire to have a public debate on the RSS-BJP polemics may remain unfulfilled, especially now that he has a little over two months to demit office.

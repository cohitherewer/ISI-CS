 Mystery of army deaths

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ujjani Tiphuk (Sivasagar), Jan. 7: In a counter-insurgency operation, Assam police yesterday killed two people who are believed to be military intelligence personnel.

 A shroud of mystery has descended over the incident with the army holding its silence. 

 It sent the body of Major Mukesh Chaurasia to his hometown in Bihar, making as little noise as possible, and had the family of the sepoy who died along with him, Bikash Sensowa, conduct the funeral quickly.

 Sensowa, 22, was buried barely an hour after being taken to his residence at Ujjani Tiphuk near Moran town in Dibrugarh district. The army team accompanying the body gave no explanation to his family about how he died.

 It is believed that the two were killed by mistake.

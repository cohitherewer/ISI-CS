 New Delhi, April 23: After General Pervez Musharraf?s visit to India, Delhi is in a quandary: how to deal with a military dictator who talks peace and what are the chances that his presidency will be stable?

 It is a sharp irony of contemporary politics that the world?s largest democracy should be concerned about threats to the stability of a military dictatorship. But that is seen as India?s best bet for lasting peace with Pakistan.

 The concern was reflected in a briefing by the Prime Minister?s special envoy to Pakistan, Satish K. Lambah. 

 A former ambassador to Pakistan, Lambah is also the convener of the 15-member National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), which met here on Thursday and Friday.

 The NSAB comprises retired general-rank officers of the army, navy and air force, former officials of intelligence agencies, security analysts, representatives of voluntary organisations and academics nominated by the Centre. It functions as a sounding board for the government and has no executive authority. 

 As special envoy, Lambah is engaged in back-channel diplomacy with his Pakistani counterpart Tariq Aziz. The two quietly scripted Musharraf?s trip and his talks with Manmohan Singh. 

 The envoy?s presentation and briefing to the NSAB mirrored the worry about the Pakistan President talking peace at a time he is confronted with domestic troubles.

 Apart from the insurgency in Baluchistan ? that is being dealt with by the Pakistan Army ? Delhi has also taken cognisance of the threat to Musharraf. It was important, peacemakers here concluded, for the general to have something substantial to ?sell? to his constituencies ? the army and the intelligentsia.

 Musharraf had pointed out that he has been a victim of terrorism. There have been three attempts on his life. 

 At a time when Delhi and Islamabad have embarked on a path to peace that has few parallels, Musharraf?s presidency is seen as crucial. 

 The general had remarked in his breakfast meeting with editors that the atmospherics were just right for a peace deal and he pushed for resolution of disputes with haste, lest the environment changes.

 Lambah is understood to have pointed out to the NSAB that Singh and Musharraf?s joint statement would allow the general to claim real gains. 

 In particular, by citing the words ?final settlement? in the statement, he would be able assure his constituencies that he has not abandoned his Kashmir agenda.

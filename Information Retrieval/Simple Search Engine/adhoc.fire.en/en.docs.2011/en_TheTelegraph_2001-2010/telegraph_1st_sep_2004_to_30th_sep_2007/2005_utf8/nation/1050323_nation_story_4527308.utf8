 Gold from garbage plan 

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, March 22: Delhi has got a chance to make some money from its mountains of solid waste.

 The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has invited investments in projects that can earn green energy credits for countries looking to trade commitments related to greenhouse gas reduction.

 To solve the problem of its three landfill sites that receive over 5,000 tonnes of solid waste a day, Delhi is planning the sale of fuel developed from garbage. It proposes to start projects to produce refuse-derived fuel and set up waste processing plants, compost plants and biomethanisation plants.

 For instance, a factory in Europe facing closure on environmental grounds can buy its way out by investing in processing methane gas from garbage landfill sites in India to prevent ozone depletion. The benefit for the company is that it will be allowed to continue functioning in Europe to help environmental causes.

 With the revenue potential from the sale of methane high at virtually no cost to the developing country, the World Bank has already approved the MCD?s proposal.

 In a bid to develop these facilities and invite global tenders for such projects, the MCD and the Infrastructure Leasing and Financing Services yesterday signed an MoU.

 In a departure from an earlier failed project of the ministry of non-conventional energy sources that tried the much criticised waste incineration process, the MCD will establish a refuse-derived fuel plant and a methanisation plant. 

 The refuse-derived fuel plant will make pellets out of garbage that has been dried and subjected to heat upto 800 degrees Celsius. While this is an alternative to coal, the methanisation plant will extract methane from the garbage and sell it as fuel.

 The MCD had obtained preliminary data on these projects from a study commissioned by the United Nations Office for Projects and Services. The Dutch company COWI, which did the study, has drawn up a comprehensive garbage master plan for Delhi.

 The plan not only includes a comprehensive proposal for waste treatment, it will also change the manner in which waste is disposed of. The plan will later be included in the new master plan for Delhi.

 Municipal commissioner Rakesh Mehta said he had no idea how much revenue could be earned by putting landfill sites on the international market for carbon credits. ?We are expecting a substantial amount as we know that we produce a high quantity of methane,? he said.

 Centre for Science and Environment director Sunita Narain said much depended on who was negotiating the deal and what price could be extracted for the carbon saved. At present, it is extremely low at $1-2 per tonne of carbon saved.

 Bihar fadeout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The Congress pre-occupation with the proposed shuffle of Manmohan Singhs team and the Natwar Singh row are threatening to divert attention from the partys poll campaign in Bihar.

 Barring Sonia Gandhi, few senior leaders have gone vote-catching in Bihar so far. Now, there is uncertainty about fielding Prime Minister Singh in the campaign field.

 So far no campaign programme for the Prime Minister has been envisaged, a party poll manager said when asked if Singh would campaign for ally Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 Although Sonia campaigned in Bihar for a day before the first phase, it is uncertain if she will go again before the third phase of polling on November 12. All of next week, she is expected to be visiting Kashmir.

 Some stalwarts overseeing the partys campaign efforts are out of Bihar. Though the ostensible reason for their absence is Diwali and Id, the proposed reshuffle next week is believed to be distracting them. Lobbying for ministerial berths has picked up momentum. Indications that Sonia is considering an AICC and CWC shake-up are not helping either.

 What is surprising is the relative indifference to the polls. Party leaders said crowds at campaign meetings, including those addressed by Sonia last month, were very thin.

 There is not much enthusiasm among the people for this election. There is hardly any election atmosphere though two rounds of polling are over, a Bihar poll observer said.

 Black day start to campaign

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, May 25: The NDA has picked the 30th anniversary of the Emergency, exactly a month from now, for the launch of its election campaign in Bihar.

 The rally will be addressed by our central leaders. It will not only commemorate the black June 25 of 1975 but also highlight the latest throttling of democracy by Indira Gandhis daughter-in-law in Bihar, state Janata Dal (United) president Vijendra Yadav said today. 

 But Laloo Prasad Yadav, who cut his teeth during the anti-Emergency movement led by Jaiprakash Narayan, will be the target of attack of the NDA.

 Before that, the NDA leaders and Lok Janshakti Party rebels said they would file an appeal against Buta Singhs decision to recommend dissolution of the Assembly. They dared the governor to order a CBI probe into his charge that horse-trading was on and that kidnapped MLAs were held captive in Jharkhand.

 Buta Singh as governor enjoys extraordinary executive powers. The authority of the council of ministers is vested in him. He is in command of the police forces. Yet he alleges that MLAs were kidnapped. If legislators can be kidnapped so easily, what about the common people? This governor must go back, Yadav said.

 In Patna, the LJP rebels said they would wait till the first week of June and decide whether to join the NDA or float a new party. Whatever the decision, we will support the NDA in the elections. The elections will not see any third player, least of all Ram Vilas Paswan, whose bluff has been called, rebel leader Narendra Singh said.

 The LJP rebels held a meeting, which was attended by 13 MLAs, including the legislature party leader Ramashray Prasad Singh. Narendra Singh said three MLAs could not attend because they were out of Patna.

 A BJP source said most LJP rebels were keen to join the Dal (U) while some wanted to come to the BJP. Officially, the NDA said it would welcome all LJP rebels and Independents who were in favour of a government led by Nitish Kumar. Asked about the criminal antecedents of some of them, state BJP president Gopal Narayan Singh said it was not a relevant issue. But Dal (U) leader Vijendra Yadav said the matter would be discussed before a decision was taken. 

 Not to be left behind, the original LJP, represented by former MLA Satish Kumar and don-turned-MP Surajbhan Singh, blamed the RJD and NDA alike for the dissolution of the Assembly.

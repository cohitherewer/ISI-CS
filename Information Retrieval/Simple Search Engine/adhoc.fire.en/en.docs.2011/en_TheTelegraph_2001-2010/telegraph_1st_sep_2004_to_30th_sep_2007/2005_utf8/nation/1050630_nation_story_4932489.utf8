 Womens cells 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, June 29: Government colleges in Haryana, which has Indias lowest sex ratio, will now have special cells for women that will hold workshops and seminars on social issues.

 One of the cells functions will be to implement a Rs 65-lakh scheme under which six women students, selected from colleges across the state, will be sent to attend national- and international- level workshops held by organisations like UN bodies and sports academies.

 The selection will be made on the basis of the students showing in their studies as well as in sports and other extracurricular activities.

 The cells will organise workshops on subjects as varied as dowry laws, property rights, sexual harassment, female foeticide and activities such as theatre, painting, music and crafts. 

 Gender sensitisation programmes will also be held for the benefit of male students and teachers.

 The sex ratio in Haryana (the number of girls per 1,000 boys) has fallen from 865 in 1991 to 861 in 2001. The all-India ratio is 933. The technology to find out the sex of the foetus combined with the practice of aborting a female foetus is the reason cited for the skewed ratio.

 A senior officer of the state higher education department said the scheme and the cells are meant to raise womens awareness of social issues. 

 We want more exposure for women in the state. The implementation of the scheme would be closely monitored, he added.

 The state government has announced a two per cent rebate in registration fees for transfer of property in the name of women, and a rebate of 10 paise per unit in electricity bills if the domestic connection is in the name of a woman. 

 A third of teachers jobs have been reserved for women. The uniform allowance for schoolgirls has been doubled from Rs 100 to Rs 200 a month.

 Bicycles are given free of cost to girl students of class VI, VII and VIII who do not have a middle school in their village.

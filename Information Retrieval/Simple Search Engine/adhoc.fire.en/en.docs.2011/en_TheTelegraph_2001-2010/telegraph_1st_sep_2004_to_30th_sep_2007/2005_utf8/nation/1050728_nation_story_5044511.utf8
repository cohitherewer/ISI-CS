NATION BRIEFS

 Mumbai, July 27 (PTI): As many as 5,000 jawans have been deployed for rescue and relief work in the metropolis battered by incessant rains since yesterday.

 Apart from army, air force and navy jawans deployed, two companies of the CRPF have been called from Pune to help in the suburbs, a state government source said.

 Forces have also been sent to Badlapur, Ambarnath, Ulhasnagar, Kalyan and Dombivili in neighbouring Thane district, sources said.

 Mumbai (PTI): Power utility Reliance Energy Ltd said on Wednesday it has restored power in 70 per cent of its supply areas in the city. However, supply had to be suspended in heavily waterlogged areas as a precautionary measure.

 Power has been switched off in areas like Kurla, Vakola, Saki Naka and some parts of Vile Parle, a Reliance Energy official said.

 The Maharashtra State Electricity Board has also kept its power supply shut in heavily inundated areas, including Thane, an official said. 

 Mangaon (PTI): Two rescue teams of the Indian Navy are on their way to Jui village in Raigad district, which has been the worst hit by floods and landslide as unabated rain continued to lash the Konkan region for the fourth day. Rescue operations have not begun yet as the floods have cut off all links to the place, district authorities said. In Kondiwate, where 34 people were killed in a landslide, only three bodies have been recovered.

 Mumbai (PTI): The Maharashtra government declared a public holiday in the city on Wednesday. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said schools in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane district have been asked to close down on Wednesday and Thursday. The chief minister, who cancelled his scheduled aerial survey of the rain-hit Raigad and Ratnagiri districts, urged people to stay indoors as the downpour is likely to continue for the next 48 hours.

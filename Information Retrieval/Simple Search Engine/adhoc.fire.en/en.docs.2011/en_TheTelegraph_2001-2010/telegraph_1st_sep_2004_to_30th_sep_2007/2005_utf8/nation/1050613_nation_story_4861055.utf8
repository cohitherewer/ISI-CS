 Laloo drama

 Patna, June 12: Laloo Prasad 

 Yadav was today accused of staging a political drama 

 after he allowed his train to be stopped by a crowd of women 

 demanding electricity and water, reports our correspondent.

 Police did not stop the women as they forced the Saharsa-bound train to a halt at a station in Barauni around 1.50 pm. The railway minister then got off his saloon car and promised to do whatever he could to make both power and water available to them.

 He accepted a memorandum from the women and spoke to them for about half an hour. 

 The railways, however, said the stop was scheduled and the women knew it, prompting several parties to question if Laloo Prasad was using the railways to campaign for the upcoming elections.

 It sounds like an orchestrated drama, a BJP supporter said in Patna. Laloo Prasad wants to raise an emotive issue and win votes.

 Hours before this, however, the main station in Barauni witnessed another demonstration. A mob, mainly of local railway colony residents, stopped the Delhi-bound Vaishali Express for about six hours in protest against power and water shortage. Some allegedly broke the trains windowpanes.

 Jaya amp; rival spar over Nokia deal

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Jayalalithaa and 

 Maran

 Chennai, April 8: Two days after Tamil Nadu inked a deal with Nokia, arch rivals ADMK and DMK are fighting to grab the credit for it.

 A memorandum of understanding was signed with the global mobile phonemaker on Wednesday to set up a plant in Tamil Nadu, the first in India.

 ADMK ministers asserted that party leader Jayalalithaa had won the Rs 675-crore handset manufacturing facility for the state.

 Industries minister Nainar Nagendran questioned the DMK?s claim of having played a key role in securing the project after the chief minister signed the MoU in Chennai. The DMK had made similar claims about projects initiated during 1991-96 under the previous ADMK regime, the minister alleged.

 The DMK pegged its argument on a statement in New Delhi two days ago by Union telecommunications minister Dayanidhi Maran that the agreement with Nokia ?was the outcome of the efforts taken by my ministry with the formation of the inter-ministerial task force headed by the telecom secretary last October to coordinate with various state governments?.

 However, Jayalalithaa today detailed in the Assembly the background of the talks Nokia had been having with her and the efforts she had made by offering a clutch of incentives that eventually swung the deal in Chennai?s favour.

 The chief minister referred to a letter she had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in January. Nokia had sought several concessions and had also asked the Centre to approve the idea of a product-specific special economic zone to suit the new business model the company was pursuing, she said.

 Jayalalithaa said the company had also been looking at Maharashtra and Haryana, but had decided to set up its manufacturing facility in ?our state for its conducive and proactive investment climate, good infrastructure and law and order situation?.

 DMK treasurer Arcot Veeraswamy said Maran had also made efforts to get the plant for Tamil Nadu. However, Jayalalithaa retorted that the central minister had merely referred to the Union finance ministry Nokia?s requests for concession on which the Centre had to take a decision.

 ?So, this is out and out the Tamil Nadu government?s effort,? said the chief minister in the House.

 Defence deficit 

 New Delhi, April 25: The government has been asked by a parliamentary standing committee to withdraw cutbacks in defence allocation and restore force levels in the army, the navy and the air force, reports our special correspondent.

 In its report released today, the parliamentary committee on defence said the government should try to allocate Rs 44,000 crore for capital expenditure by the services. The finance minister?s allocation of Rs 34,375 crore would not adequately address security concerns, the report said.

 The committee also recommended that the government guarantee a minimum percentage of the gross domestic product to the defence services ?at all costs every year?.

 The committee felt after presentations by the army, the navy and the air force that there were shortfalls in force levels. It said there was a ?critical shortage? of artillery guns with the army. 

 Gun trial lapse

 As a controversy rages over a deal with South African arms manufacturer Denel, the parliamentary committee has expressed surprise that no field trials were conducted to decide the suitability of bids received for acquiring self-propelled guns required for upgrading of the army?s arsenal.

 The navy needs mine counter vessels, submarines and long-range surveillance aircraft. A 10 per cent cut imposed by the finance ministry has made it difficult for the navy to recruit adequate numbers of civilian staff for its exclusive base in Karwar. Half the staff in the navy is civilian.

 The squadron strength of the air force, the report noted, is 37 as against a requirement of 39.5. By 2007, the end of the 10th plan, the shortage will be a third of the requirement. 

 The report also urged the defence ministry to simplify procurement procedure and buy new aircraft. It said the air force?s inventory should not be diversified.

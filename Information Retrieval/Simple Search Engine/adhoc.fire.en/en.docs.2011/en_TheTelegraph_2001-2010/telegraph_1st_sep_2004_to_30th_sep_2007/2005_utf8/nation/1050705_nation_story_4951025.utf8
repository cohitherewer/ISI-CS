 Mountains closer, by air

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, July 4: For those who love mountains, the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas have come closer. And they dont need to huff and puff their way up the steep slopes.

 Neither is there any fear of frostbites.

 The Jammu and Kashmir government today launched the air safari service for an aerial view of world-famous scenic spots in the state. 

 The inaugural flight of the Kashmir Air Safari today took its VIP passengers ? chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and civil aviation minister Praful Patil ? close to the Nun Kun mountain range in Zanskar near Kargil.

 After the plane circled the nearly 24,800-foot peaks, both Mufti and Patel said it was an experience of a lifetime and said the flight was a milestone in tourism promotion in the state. 

 Mooted by Mufti, the service is the third in South Asia since Pakistan and Nepal introduced such Himalayan safaris.

 While Nepal has the worlds highest peak, Mount Everest, second highest, K2, and Nanga Parbat are in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 This kind of tourism is only possible where natural beauty of the Himalayas is available, said S. Katoch, director, civil aviation, Jammu and Kashmir, who piloted the flight with Haroon Lone as co-pilot.

 The safari has been launched to showcase the natural beauty of the state, said tourism minister Ghulam Hassan Mir.

 Italian ambassador Antonio Armellini, who also had a close view of the snow-covered ranges, said he was delighted. 

 Abdul Aziz Wani, the managing-director of the state tourism development corporation, said passengers would be charged Rs 3,300 for an aerial visit to places such as Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Nun Kun, Yusmarg and Dodhpathri.

 While Rs 6,600 would be charged for an hour-long safari to Leh and Kargil, a Srinagar-Leh one-and-a-half-hour sortie would cost Rs 11,200, he added. Bookings, Wani added, have started on a good note.

 To begin with, the air safari has been started at a promotional rate by the tourism department and, depending on the response, the government intends to lease 10-15-seater private planes. At the moment, 11-seater state-owned planes would carry the eight passengers.

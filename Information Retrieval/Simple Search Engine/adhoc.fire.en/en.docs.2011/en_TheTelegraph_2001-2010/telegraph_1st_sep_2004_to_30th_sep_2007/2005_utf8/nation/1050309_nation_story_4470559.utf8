 Sleaze fest on Oriya TV

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, March 8: Move over Kaanta Laga and Pardesiya, it?s time for a Oriya music video sleaze fest.

 In the just-released video Tike lift dabaki (Can you give me a lift?), a girl in a towel makes suggestive gestures while tapping her feet to the tune of water trickling from an overhead tap. The camera zooms in on the girl?s body at will, making the video ?hot property? for viewers as well as producers. 

 In the video of Saare dauna khinki pahare (Why aren?t you hitting me, sir?), a girl teases her tutor in a manner which leaves little to the imagination. 

 The lyrics are mostly tasteless and the videos, cheap copies of Hindi remixes. While producers and a section of buyers are not complaining, voices are also heard against the growing obscenity on TV. ?The videos are so tasteless that I have to switch off the TV whenever they are shown. You can?t see the videos even with your wife,? said Sanjay Kumar Jena, a viewer.

 The Oriya music album boom began five years ago. With youngsters getting exposed to fashion shows and beauty pageants, not to mention Kaanta Laga and Kaliyon ka Chaman, producers of music videos felt the time was ripe to cash in on the sleaze trend.

 The emergence of a number of private channels also helped the producers find a platform for their videos. 

 Regional censor officer Amitabh Sharma admits that most of the videos, whose makers do not care for certificates, border on obscenity.

 In an industry where production costs are low and profits are guaranteed once 20,000 cassettes are sold, there is no dearth of players. ?With over 100 music companies currently in the race to churn out hits, some producers take the easy route and make raunchy videos that sell fast,? said Srikanta Nanda, proprietor of Sun Music, a Cuttack-based company. 

 Jayprakash Mohanty, a director, feels that not all music videos are vulgar. ?At times the girls come to the music companies requesting the producers for a chance to prove themselves at any cost,? he said.

 Namita Panda, chairperson of the State Commission for Women, said: ?The problem of unwed motherhood can be traced to vulgarity in the Oriya music videos. It?s as if nudity is becoming part of our culture. What is worse is that everyone seems to be enjoying them.?

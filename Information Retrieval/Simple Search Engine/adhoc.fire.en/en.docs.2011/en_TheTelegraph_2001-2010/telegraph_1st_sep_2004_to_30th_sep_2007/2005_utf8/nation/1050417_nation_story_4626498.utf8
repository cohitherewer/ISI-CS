 New Delhi, April 16 (PTI): A birth certificate believed to be that of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was handed over to the Prime Minister?s Office by the New Delhi Municipal Council today.

 The civic body handed over birth certificates of three children born to a Mr Musharraf in 1941, 1942 and 1945. It found entries for two boys born on August 11, 1942 and July 22, 1945, both identified as ?son of Musharraf? and delivered at the Lala Girdharilal Maternity Hospital. 

 entry for a girl born on July 19, 1941, identified as ?daughter of Musharraf, son of Shaiffudin?, was also found. 

 The August 11, 1942 birth certificate is believed to be Pervez Musharraf?s and is to be gifted to him.

 g her visit to the capital last month, Musharraf?s mother had visited the hospital and said she would like to get the birth certificates of her two sons, Javed and Pervez, born in July 1941 and August 1942.

 New Delhi (PTI): An organisation of Kashmiri Pandits in 

an open letter to the Pakistan President has stressed on the need to control jehadi 

elements and protect the values of ?Kashmiriyat?.

 ?We, the victims of genocide, seek your cooperation in establishing a humane society in Kashmir by controlling the jehadi elements who recently even opposed the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service,? the All India Kashmir Samaj said in the letter.

 This, it said, was important to ?reinstall the cherished values of Kashmiriyat so that all faiths, castes and creeds can live and co-exist as honourable citizens of this great country?.

 ?That now the process of uniting the divided people has been set in motion, it is surprising that the fate of Kashmiri Pandits, the worst victims of genocide, has never caught your attention,? the Kashmiri organisation said, adding that a secular Kashmir was important for having communal amity in the sub-continent. 

 Jaipur (PTI): The Pakistani general was caught on camera with Indian Air Force officers on Saturday.

 The pilots who ferried Pervez Musharraf and his entourage to Ajmer in their helicopters requested him for a group photograph with them on return.

 Vadodara (PTI): The Indian Fishermen?s Association will 

appeal to Musharraf in Delhi to free fishermen lodged in Pakistani jails and release 

boats captured by Pakistan Marine Agency.

 In all, 199 boats have been captured and 275 fishermen are lodged in different 

jails there,? association chief Veljibhai Masani said before leaving for the capital 

on Saturday. 

 ?But if this plan does not materialise, we will try to catch the general?s attention at the Kotla during the final one-dayer,? he said. 

 ?Our members will carry placards and don T-shirts with our demands written on them. 

 ?As India has released all the Pakistani fishermen, it is now Pakistan?s turn to reciprocate,? he said.

 Womans blood on rebel hands

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Aug. 14: For the first time in Andhra Pradesh, Maoist guerrillas have killed a woman who is not a renegade comrade.

 Salima, a 32-year-old schoolteacher, was dragged out of her home in Karimnagars Kasaram village in the small hours today and shot dead.

 According to a note left by the attackers, Salima was a police informer and had ignored several warnings from the rebels. In the interest of the movement and the village, we had to eliminate her, Chandranna, the leader of the local Maoist guerrilla squad, said.

 The district superintendent of police, Devender Singh Chauhan, denied that Salima was a police informer. She was only a policemans daughter, not an informer, he said.

 Maoist spokesperson P. Varavara Rao confirmed that Salima is the first woman civilian to have been killed by the rebels in the state, though renegade women Naxalites have earlier been eliminated.

 The police and the guerrillas have been fighting a bitter war in Andhra jungles since the collapse of the peace talks, which began in October 2004.

 Since the Maoists walked out of the dialogue in January, more than 375 people ? including 175 militants and 150 civilians ? have been killed.

 The state police chief, Swaranjit Sen, has urged his subordinates to attack the Maoists in their hideouts. Dont wait for them to attack police stations, he said in a circular. You should hit their hideouts and smoke them out.

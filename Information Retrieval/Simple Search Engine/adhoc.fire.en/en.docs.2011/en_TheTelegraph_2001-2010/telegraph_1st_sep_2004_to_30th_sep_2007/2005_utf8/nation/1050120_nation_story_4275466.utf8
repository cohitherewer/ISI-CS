 Drought moves to classroom

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

Hyderabad, Jan. 19: Three classrooms, two students 

and one teacher.

 If the seeds have failed to sprout through Anantpur?s arid earth, the drought has entered classrooms, too, as entire families have shifted out of their villages leaving behind empty schools. Like this primary school in D. Cherlopalli village.

 One of the many in Andhra Pradesh?s drought-stricken Rayalaseema region, the school has seen its attendance plummet with the exodus of families from the village. Over 85 of the 118 farmer families in D. Cherlopalli have turned into migrant labourers, unable to cope with rising debt and massive power bills.

 The drought has stagnated development in the rural areas, said Venkataswamy, a villager. ?All drinking water wells have dried up. Village roads have turned into playgrounds without maintenance,? he added.

 ?We have teachers, school buildings, etc., organised with World Bank funds. Even the mid-day meal programme has not attracted children simply because family after family has shifted to cities and out-of-state towns,? said a senior official in the school education department.

 The school in D. Cherlopalli is just one of the 7,132 primary schools in the state which has less than 10 students. The state capital alone has over 71 primary schools with around five to seven students. Drought, however, is not the only reason for the empty classrooms. Lack of infrastructure is also to blame.

 Vexed with mounting costs and lean attendance, the school education department had offered adoption of such schools by panchayats and philanthropists. ?We are not looking for just funds but also the need for social involvement in such institutions,? school education minister N. Rajyalakshmi Reddy said.

 According to statistics available, over 25,000 government schools and another 16,000 private institutions will be in a similar situation all over the state. ?Most of them will be schools run for scheduled tribes and Dalits,? said an official.

 To inspire private participation, the state government has launched a scheme to encourage donations. ?One could have a high school in their name if they pay a donation of Rs 10 lakh, an upper primary school in a place of their choice if they give Rs 7.5 lakh and a primary school if they can contribute Rs 5 lakh and above,? said school education chairman K.C. Reddy.

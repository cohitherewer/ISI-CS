 Atal state safety net in bin

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 28: The government has overturned decisions the Inter-State Council had taken when it was chaired by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to amend Article 356 to build safeguards into the Constitution for preventing misuse.

 At the council?s meeting in Srinagar in 2003, Vajpayee and his deputy L.K. Advani had agreed to demands from states to internalise the safeguards enlisted by the Supreme Court in the S.R. Bommai case. The court had advised against dissolution of an Assembly either by the governor or the President before the proclamation was laid before Parliament and approved.

 The NDA government had also agreed that state governments should be given an opportunity to explain their position before imposition of President?s rule.

 Vajpayee had instructed the law ministry to begin work on drafting amendments to the Constitution on the basis of the council?s recommendations. However, Advani?s successor in North Block, Shivraj Patil, has turned down both decisions of the council that had been agreed to by the NDA.

 The decisions have been conveyed to members of the standing committee of the council, now chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, that will meet tomorrow and could come up for discussion when the council reviews the implementation of the Sarkaria Commission report on Centre-state relations.

 A home ministry report on the implementation of the commission?s recommendations has argued that the judgment in the Bommai case would be adequate for providing safeguards against possible misuse of Article 356 that empowers the Centre to impose President?s rule.

 Incorporating the safeguards into the Constitution, it has been argued, could create difficulties. It could create political uncertainty, particularly when such a proclamation is issued at a time the Lok Sabha ? which has to ratify the decision within two months ? stands dissolved. 

 ?Sometimes, it can also lead to horse-trading in the intervening period, especially when it is a coalition government...? the report said.

 The report has also said issuing a showcause notice to a state government would ?lead to undesirable litigation? and frustrate the constitutional intent.

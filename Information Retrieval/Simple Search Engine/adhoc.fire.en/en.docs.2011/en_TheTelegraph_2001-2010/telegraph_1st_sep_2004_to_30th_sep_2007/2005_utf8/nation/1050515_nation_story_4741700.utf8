Cannes, May 14: Whatever the diehards back in Calcutta may or may not think about the marital status of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the fact remains that the Shyam Benegal directed blockbuster, Bose : The Forgotten Hero, is being sold in Cannes to the Germans partly on the strength that he married a German.

 There was no doubt that Netaji did marry a German woman, said Shabbir Boxwala, production head, Sahara One Motion Pictures, the producer of the movie.

 Shyam Benegal did a lot of research, said Boxwala, by way of evidence. We dont show the death of Bose but the film carries the radio announcement that his plane had crashed, added Boxwala.

 The plan was to hold market screenings of the film at Cannes, but we could not do this partly because of pre-release tension, he explained. We could not get a print here.

 Nevertheless, Sahara are trying to interest the Germans, the Italians and the Japanese because Bose lived in all these countries, he said.

 Germany was one of the countries where the film was shot. Other locations were India, Afghanistan, Singapore and Myanmar (Burma).

 Its one of the epic Indian films at Cannes, he said. It cost $6.2 million ? Rs 32 crore with marketing costs.

 The word from India, following the films nationwide release, is apparently encouraging. We are getting 65 per cent houses, said Boxwala.

 However, to recover the investment, the film will have to do well overseas. We have sold the film to all the overseas territories ? it opens next week in the UK where we have sold the rights to Eros, disclosed Boxwala.

 In Britain, British historians have usually taken a dim view of Netajis collaboration with Adolf Hitler. However, historians acknowledge that whatever the books might say it is often the film version of history that tends to stick in the popular imagination. Now, Sahara is trying to sell international rights to the DVD, VHS and VCD versions of the film.

 Boxwala was flanked by his colleague, Sandeep Bhargava, chief operating officer of Sahara One Motion Pictures, who commented: We have had interest from television companies in North America, Asia and Europe but the process is slow. Therefore, we are having to be pro-active.

 Although this is small compensation for the failure to hold a screening at Cannes, todays issue of The Hollywood Reporter does carry an ad for the film, which is described as an epic of Gandhi proportions. If Bose does well, there could be parallels with Richard Attenboroughs Gandhi, which is now taken by cinema audiences throughout the world as an accurate depiction of the life and times of the Mahatma.

 But the biggest culprits when it comes to distorting history are the Americans. According to Hollywood, the Germans secret code during World War II, known as Enigma, was broken by the Americans. 

 In real life, the code was cracked by the British without Polish help.

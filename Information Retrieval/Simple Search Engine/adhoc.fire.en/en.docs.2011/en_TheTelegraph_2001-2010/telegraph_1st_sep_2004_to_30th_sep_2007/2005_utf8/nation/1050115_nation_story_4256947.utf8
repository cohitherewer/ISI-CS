 New Delhi, Jan. 14: The Central Bureau of Investigation has decided, a day before Mayavati?s 48th birthday, to seek closure of the Taj heritage corridor case against the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and nearly half-a-dozen bureaucrats.

 The CBI had sought the opinion of attorney-general Milon Banerjee on filing a chargesheet against Mayavati after investigators and legal experts in the bureau could not arrive at a decision.

 The sleuths believed that they had sufficient evidence to pursue the case registered under the Supreme Court?s supervision, but legal experts in the bureau felt they had not been able to back up their suspicions with evidence to make out a legally sustainable case.

 The Rs 175-crore Taj heritage corridor case had acquired political overtones after Congress MP Renuka Choudhury, the tourism minister in the United Progressive Alliance government, played whistleblower to highlight reports of the scandal that she declared was the mother of all scams and demanded a thorough inquiry.

 Mayavati was then the Uttar Pradesh chief minister and considered an ally of the BJP. She has since been cautious and resisted any temptation to criticise the Congress government at the Centre.

 At a media briefing today, the BSP chief charged the previous BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government with trying to ?implicate? her in the case.

 ?It is a false case. The BJP tried to implicate me as part of a conspiracy to seek BSP support. They wanted to pressure me, but I did not fall in their trap,? she said. Mayavati blamed the BJP for her troubles, saying the party ?has tried several times to malign my image?. The Taj case, she said, was the latest example.

 The BSP chief did not seem bothered that the CBI intends to continue with the second case registered against her ? possession of assets disproportionate to her known sources of income. Mayavati said she was confident that the CBI would find her innocent in all cases like in the past.

 A CBI official said the bureau would file a status report before the Supreme Court, which has been monitoring investigations after ordering a probe into the Taj corridor scam.

 Amisha: Parent pain

Mumbai, Feb. 14 (PTI): The legal row between Amisha Patel and her family has got murkier with the actor issuing a notice in a newspaper warning the public against dealing with her parents and brother as they are not her constituted attorneys.

 Amisha issued the statement yesterday, saying those dealing with them would be doing so at their own risk.

 She had earlier slapped a legal notice on her parents Amit and Asha and brother Ashmit asking them to return her money that they had kept ?illegally and unlawfully?. 

 She had also alleged that they had ?misappropriated and used her savings?, according to her lawyer Vibhav Krishna.

 Amisha?s family denied representing her as her constituted attorneys and wrote a letter to her saying so.

 The public notice clarified that Amisha has not given any power of attorney, authority or authorisation to her father, mother or brother, singly or jointly.

 The actor, who has been staying separately from her parents, added that any such authority that may be shown by her family to the public would be false, bogus and fabricated and would stand cancelled, terminated and withdrawn.

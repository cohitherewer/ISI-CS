 New Delhi, April 12: Even the pavements will shine for the President.

 Four days before Pervez Musharraf sets foot in Delhi, authorities have gone into overdrive to spruce up the city. The facelift would cost Rs 4 crore.

 All roads leading to Ferozeshah Kotla, the venue of the final one-dayer that the Pakistan President is scheduled to watch, are set for a new look. While streetlights would change from the ordinary to the ornamental, footpaths ? about 2,600 square metres of them ? would get new tiles.

 Special bulbs would light up flyover underpasses and some 2,000 plants would add a touch of green. All because the government wants the Pakistanis to see Delhi at its best ? be it during day or at night.

 The four roads set for the facelift are the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, which houses the newspaper offices, Indraprastha Marg, on which are located the income tax office, police headquarters and offices of the Delhi Development Authority, Ring Road, on which are located Rajghat and Red Fort, and Vikas Marg that leads to the secretariat. 

 Khooni Darwaza, the monument on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg where the sons of India?s last Mughal emperor were murdered by the British and where a student of the nearby Maulana Azad Medical College was raped two years ago, would be lit up with special focus lights.

 Near the stadium, a high-security entrance for Musharraf is being carved out from the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Park that had been resurrected from a neglected park by former urban development minister Jagmohan.

 The park that was made off-limits for lunching office-goers to preserve its beauty is now where Musharraf will make the perfect entrance for the face-off between the rivals, a day after he lands in India.

 But cricket is not the only thing on the general?s mind. Musharraf also wants to keep his date with Ajmer Sharif this time. Pakistani officials handed over a preliminary travel plan according to which the general would like to land straight in Jaipur from where he would take a helicopter to Ajmer on April 16.

 Rajasthan officials, however, prefer the visit to be on Monday as there would be a huge rush to the shrine on Saturday because of an important religious occasion. 

 The Pakistani officials have promised to get back after talking to the President?s secretariat. Musharraf had planned to visit Ajmer in 2002 but cancelled the trip as the atmosphere was not congenial after the Agra summit failed.

 Sena threat

 The Shiv Sena today threatened to ?go to any extent?, including digging the Kotla pitch, to prevent the match from being played. ?This cricket series is nothing but rubbing salt on the injuries of the victims of Pak-sponsored terrorism,? Delhi unit chief Jai Bhagwan Goyal said.

 Shakuntala: Shifting stance

 Bhopal, May 17: A week after the brutal attack on Shakuntala Verma, a mob yesterday chased away a Madhya Pradesh government official in Khargaon district who tried to prevent child marriages from being solemnised in a village.

 Tehsildar M.L. Verma was threatened and abused when he reached Bistan, about 300 km from state capital Bhopal, where over 40 couples were tying the knot at a community function.

 Verma said he found two girls below consenting age. But when he tried to stop them from being married off, he was surrounded by members of the Kulmi samaj, an influential backward class grouping. 

 I was told that I was not required at the pious occasion. When I insisted, I was abused and threatened. In the absence of an adequate police force, I had little option but to flee the scene, he said.

 Mangla Chandore, supervisor of the state-run women and child welfare department, confirmed the incident but said she did not stay at the spot very long. The mobs vibes were not very friendly.

 The tehsildar, however, did not give up. He rushed to the office of Khargaon superintendent of police Meenakshi Sharma, who sent a police force to the village. Later, district collector S.K. Paul said the community leaders were persuaded not to marry off underage girls.

 A villager said these marriages were to have been solemnised on May 11, on the auspicious Akshaya Tritiya, but were rescheduled for May 16.

 In Indore, Shakuntala, who was brutally assaulted for opposing child marriages in Dhar district, today said she had not fully recognised the prime accused who was arrested on Sunday. 

 The police have shown me various photographs, but I have not fully recognised the arrested person as I had not seen him before, the woman and child development official said from the hospital where she has been admitted.

 For the first time since the attack on May 10, Shakuntala appeared unclear about the motive behind the assault in which one of her arms was nearly chopped off.

 The crusader against child marriage said her opposition to the social evil may or may not have been responsible. She said she had been touring a number of villages as part of her job. Maybe, some persons were affected because of it. This could be the reason behind the incident, she added.

 Asked whether her campaign against child marriage could be the reason, she said: It could be child marriage also.

 So far, Shakuntala and her family had been saying her crusade was the only reason for the gruesome attack.

 The states women and child welfare secretary, S.R. Mohanty, told The Telegraph a direct link between the attack on Shakuntala and child marriage was not important. 

 We are committed to two things. First, we will do everything to eradicate a social evil like child marriage. Second, we are committed to punishing anyone guilty of the dastardly attack on her, he said.

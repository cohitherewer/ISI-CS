 Oust illegal tenants from govt houses: Delhi court 

 New Delhi, Dec. 26 (PTI): A Delhi court has ordered the immediate ouster of unauthorised occupants from government accommodations in Gulabi Bagh following a rise in crime in the north Delhi area.

 It has been noticed that many flats in Gulabi Bagh have not been occupied by the original allottees but let out to strangers. Whenever crime is committed, these suspects are not located as they live for a short period due to which crime is on the rise, metropolitan magistrate Ajay Goel said while hearing a robbery case from the area.

 The police, who were on the lookout for a man involved in a vehicle theft, told the court that the accused was living in a government accommodation as a tenant of the original allottee. 

 However, now, some other tenant was occupying the house as the accused person had vacated the place. 

 Expressing concern at the brazen violation of government rules, the court sought a report from the executive engineer of the area and secretaries of the residents welfare associations by January 3, the next date of hearing.

 The court has asked them to inform it what action they have taken and how far they have succeeded in implementing the order.

 Earlier, a committee comprising the executive engineer of the area and the superintendent (allotment) of the public works department was formed to deal with the lawbreakers. 

 However, they could not make much headway.

 The assistant housing commissioner had also submitted that they had conducted a detailed survey.

 However, the court said it was not satisfied with the process.

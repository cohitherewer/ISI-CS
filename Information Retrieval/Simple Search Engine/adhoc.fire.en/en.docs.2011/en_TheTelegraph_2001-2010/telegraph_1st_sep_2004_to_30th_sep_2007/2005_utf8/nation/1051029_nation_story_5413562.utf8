 Heritage scanner on Mumbai mills

 mumbai: 

 Bombay High Court on Friday asked the Greater Mumbai 

 Heritage Committee to conduct a survey of 58 textile mills 

 and notify it within three months whether they can be declared 

 heritage structures, reports our special correspondent.

 The high court bench also directed mill owners to grant access to the panel to examine the structures and ascertain their heritage value. The ruling followed a petition filed by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.

 The bench asked the Maharashtra government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to provide assistance to the heritage committee to carry out the survey. The court did not stay the demolition of any structure on the mills premises, but said it hopes and expects the status quo on demolitions would be maintained.

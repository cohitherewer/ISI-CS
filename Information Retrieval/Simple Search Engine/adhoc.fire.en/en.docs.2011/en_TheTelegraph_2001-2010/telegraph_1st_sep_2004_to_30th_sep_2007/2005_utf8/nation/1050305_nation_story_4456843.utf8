 Cloud over Orissa power trade 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 4: A scam cloud hovers over Orissa?s power trade with the role of the Grid Corporation of Orissa (Gridco) coming under the scanner.

 Yielding to pressure from members of the Assembly, Speaker Maheswar Mohanty on Wednesday ruled that the House committee on power would look into the allegations of irregularities in power trading by Gridco and submit its interim report in three months. 

 Members of the Opposition had alleged during a discussion on an adjournment motion that Gridco sustained a loss of Rs 200 crore for trading power to outside agencies without floating tenders. 

 The members had also alleged that the deals involved a kickback of Rs 200 crore and adversely affected the state exchequer. They demanded an impartial probe by the CBI or the House committee headed by the Speaker.

 While rejecting the demand for a probe, energy minister Suryo Narayan Patro said Gridco had done nothing wrong in selecting marketing agents to trade the state?s surplus power.

 He clarified that the board of directors of Gridco had decided in November 2002 to float a national tender for selecting marketing agents for the purpose. A couple of agencies responded and Gridco entered into an agreement with Koyela Energy Resources Private Limited (KERPL), which made an offer of Rs 1.84 per unit. Gridco decided to sell 100 MW of power at the rate of Rs 2.03 per unit, which was later revised to Rs 2.12 per unit.

 The agreement with KERPL was for three months but it was terminated when the agency failed to trade a single unit in the period of agreement.

 On July 3, 2003, Gridco decided to supply 100 MW to the Power Trading Corporation and NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd each for a year at the rate of Rs 2.15 per unit as no other agencies were prepared to accept the security mechanism. Patro said Gridco?s cumulative loss was Rs 1,788 crore when the BJD-BJP government came to power.

 Orissa Gana Parishad leader Arun Dey accused the energy minister of defending the deal as two ?very powerful party leaders? had stakes in a private power trading company with which the Gridco had entered into an agreement.

 De-mining blast at George 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 6: Indias biggest military mobilisation called Operation Parakram has come in for flak from the comptroller and auditor general because the defence ministry under George Fernandes delayed the procurement of de-mining equipment.

 Both India and Pakistan use outdated landmines which take a toll of lives during the de-mining process and often years after the militaries have stepped back from confrontationist postures.

 Over the last two months, the army and the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in Jammu and Kashmir were involved in the tardy process of de-mining in the Uri sector to make the passage of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus safe.

 More than 10 lakh mines were laid by the army along the boundary with Pakistan during the face-off in 2001-2003 following a militant attack on Parliament. The mines laid in the forward deployment during Operation Parakram were twice the number used in the 1971 war.

 In its report presented in Parliament today, the CAG said the delay in procuring and deploying robotic equipment for de-mining forced jawans to manually clear the mines with a lot of risk. 

 The face-off during Parakram was possibly the biggest mine-laying operation in Asia since World War II. 

 The CAG has commented on the process of procurement of robotic systems for de-mining. The defence ministry had proposed to import a total of 40 special de-mining systems through the fast-track procedure. Three companies were shortlisted but a technical evaluation committee found only one that was suitable in Indian conditions.

 The company had given a delivery schedule of four months for 32 systems by November 2002. But the equipment was received only between June 2003 and March 2004, eight to 16 months late.

 The CAG noted that of about 2,78,300 mines that were to be mechanically recovered, only 1,182 were defused. The rest were recovered manually.

 Mine-clearing operations involve ?prodding? the ground at a 45-degree angle with an iron ?prodder?. If the ?prodder? strikes metal, the soldiers take cover. One has to use bare hands to slowly sift through the sand and dust and recover the mine. The slightest error can result in tragedy.

 Army sources say mining and de-mining during Parakram took a toll of 81 lives in 2002-2003.

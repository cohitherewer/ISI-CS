 Record visitors at Mughal Gardens

 New Delhi (PTI): A record 1.2 lakh people 

 visited the Mughal Gardens in Rashtrapati Bhavan on Sunday, 

 the highest-ever number of visitors in a single day since 

 it was thrown open for public viewing.

 The garden was open to the public for about a month for the first time during the tenure of the first President Rajendra Prasad and since then it has been a big attraction for people in Delhi and other parts of the country.

 ?This time it has received (an) unprecedented number of visitors since it opened on February 11. So far about 2.5 lakh people have visited the garden,? a Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson said.

 He said the Mughal Gardens and its adjacent herbal garden are open for public viewing until March 13. The garden is closed on every Monday for maintenance.

 Cheque bounce cases

 Mumbai (PTI): Forum for Fairness in Administration, 

 a non-government organisation, has written a letter to the 

 chief justice of Bombay High Court saying that in spite 

 of its order to expedite the disposal of cheque bounce cases, 

 no steps have been taken.

 The forum has filed a petition before the court against the large number of pending cases of cheques bouncing. On February 1, the high court had directed the Maharashtra government to set up additional courts in the state to expedite the disposal of such cases.

 A bench of Chief Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice D. Chandrachud also asked the chief secretary to appoint 100 more magistrates to deal with such cases and asked the state to provide them adequate staff within two months. The forum in its letter, however, said not a single magistrate has been appointed even after two weeks of the passing of the order.

 It alleged that different metropolitan courts had shuffled their duties, resulting in a chaos. They also alleged that courts assigned to handle cheque bouncing cases had been given remand cases, thus making it difficult for them to take up cheque bounce cases.

 CBI to oppose gutka bail

 Mumbai (PTI): The CBI and the Mumbai 

 police would oppose in Bombay High Court on Monday the plea 

 made by gutka barons Rasiklal Manikchand Dhariwal and Jagdish 

 Joshi for quashing non-bailable warrants against them for 

 their failure to appear in a case of alleged links with 

 underworld.

 Earlier, the court had extended till February 21 their order restraining police from executing warrants issued by a special court against them.

 Tortoises seized

 Varanasi (PTI): Police seized 300 

 tortoises worth Rs 4 lakh being smuggled to Bengal and arrested 

 four persons in this connection in Phoolpur area. Acting 

 on a tip-off, a police team intercepted a car near Khalishpur 

 railway station and recovered the tortoises from the vehicle 

 on Saturday.

 Fake licences

 Chennai (PTI): Six persons have 

 been arrested in connection with preparing and selling fake 

 driving licenses. Police nabbed a real estate owner, Sekar, 

 while investigating reports on sale of fake driving licences. 

 On the information given by him, they arrested five of his 

 accomplices, police said adding that a team would be sent 

 to Delhi to find some others involved in the case.

 Shops gutted

 Pune(PTI): Five timber shops were 

 gutted in a fire in Bhavanipeth area on Sunday. Nine shops 

 were partially burnt. However, no casualties were reported 

 in the fire that broke out around 5 am, fire brigade sources 

 said. The damage caused was estimated at Rs 30 lakh.

 including a four-year-old child, died and 27 were taken

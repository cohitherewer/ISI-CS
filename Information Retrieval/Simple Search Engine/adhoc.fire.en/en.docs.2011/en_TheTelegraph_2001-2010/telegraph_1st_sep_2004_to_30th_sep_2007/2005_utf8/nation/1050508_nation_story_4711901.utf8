 Foreign top gun home bill: Rs 41 lakh

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 New Delhi, May 7: Split air conditioners for bedrooms, special furniture for childrens rooms, coffee tables, durables like washing machine, microwave and refrigerator.

 Total expenses: Rs 40.92 lakh from 2000 to 2003. All for the foreign secretarys residence, according to the latest report of the comptroller and auditor general.

 While government rules put the cap at Rs 2.5 lakh for expenses on furniture and electrical appliances at the residence of a Union cabinet minister, the external affairs ministry spent about Rs 41 lakh on the foreign secretarys residence in the three years, the CAG report said.

 Although the ministry contended that the expenditure was made on the ground that the bureaucrat had to entertain foreign dignitaries, it was observed that most of the items were for bedrooms, the living room and for other areas of personal use.

 The report said Rs 31.26 lakh was spent during 2002-03.

 Giving the break-up, the audit said 10 split air conditioners costing nearly Rs 5 lakh were purchased and many of them were fixed in bedrooms, family living rooms and the lobby. It added that Rs 1.5 lakh was spent on five beds for the master bedroom, daughters bedroom and sons bedroom.

 The CAG noted that Rs 2.95 lakh was spent on six carpets and Rs 1.42 lakh on items like washing machine, microwave and refrigerator. About Rs 20 lakh was spent on coffee, breakfast and dining tables besides furniture.

 Following clarifications sought by the audit, the ministry said last year no orders had been issued on the monetary ceiling for articles to be used at the foreign secretarys residence and no scale of furniture prescribed.

 The CAG noted that during 2000-02, items like carpets, sofa sets, vacuum cleaners, gas cylinders and coffee tables worth Rs 9.66 lakh were bought, taking the total ?irregular and unjustified expenditure? to Rs 40.92 lakh during 2000-03. 

 The ministry contended these items were provided on the lines of what was provided to heads of Indian missions abroad. The CAG termed the reply ?untenable? and noted that the entitlement of heads of missions was governed by a different set of conditions and, even then, items of personal use were not allowed to be provided.

 The CAG also pointed out that the navy had not reclaimed funds and had overspent resources in procuring its three stealth frigates, the INS Talwar, INS Trishul and INS Tabar from Russia.

 ?Naval headquarters failed to synchronise the training of the crew with the actual delivery schedule of the frigates and repatriate the crew even after uncertainties in the commissioning of frigates became known. Irregular retention of crew and their premature expatriation earlier caused avoidable expenditure of Rs 30.12 crore. Navy also failed to levy liquidated damages of Rs 177.10 crore on the builder,? the CAG said.

 The frigates were contracted in 1997 with a Russian firm for Rs 3,040 crore.

 In another report, the CAG has dwelt at length on the slippages in maintenance of vehicles and artillery for the army. 

 ?There were significant underperformances in achieving the targets for overhaul of various equipment. The shortfall in overhaul of tanks and infantry combat vehicles was up to 68 per cent, transport vehicles up to 58 per cent, for vehicle engines it was up to 40 per cent and for manufacture of spares it was up to 42 per cent.

 ?As a result, the overhaul schedule of these equipment was not adhered to, adversely affecting their operational readiness,? the CAG said on the functioning of army base workshops from 1999 to 2004.

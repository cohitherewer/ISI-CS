 Chambal dacoit shot

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, March 1: Madhya Pradesh police have killed dacoit Hazrat Rawat in Dabra near Gwalior as part of a drive to cleanse the dacoit-infested Chambal region.

 However, there were conflicting claims on how Rawat?s end came. Home minister Jagdish Dewda said Rawat, wanted in 93 cases of murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping, extortion and intimidation, was trapped by the police early in the morning. 

 Residents of Dabra said the dacoit succumbed to injuries suffered in a police encounter on February 27 in neighbouring Shivpuri district. Rawat had received multiple bullet injuries in the jaw and below the waist at Chhota Bhansada village, about 90 km from Gwalior.

 Dewda said Rawat?s gang members were trying sneak into Gwalior?s Bhitargaon village for treatment when he was gunned down. ?An exchange of fire took place between the police and the gang, which left Rawat dead,? Dewda said.

 There seems to be some merit in the local buzz. The police had no plausible explanation for the absence of bloodstains at the scene of crime although they claimed the dacoit had been hit on his knees.

 Rawat?s reign of terror spread across Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh for over 12 years. He was carrying a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head. 

 In police records, he was given the code name, T-9 ? the ninth most-wanted target. The T (target) list had been drawn up after Rawat?s arch rival Rambabu Gadaria mowed down 13 Gujjars in Bhanwarpura village, prompting the state police to launch a massive hunt in the Chambal.

 A force of over 2,000 policemen had been combing Chambal since October 29 last year. Senior police officials claimed that their men were forced to eat sattu and muri as they were too tired to carry utensils along with arms, ammunition and other equipment.

 Considered a messiah by his caste, which he had protected against the Gadaria gang, Rawat was given the title of Hazrat (revered).

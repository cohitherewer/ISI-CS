 Laloo assets case enters last lap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 16: The startling revelation in the Supreme Court that a person tried to interfere in the judicial process has come at a time the trial in the disproportionate assets case is inching towards a verdict before the court of special CBI judge Yogendra Prasad.

 The assets case is an offshoot of the multi-crore fodder swindle in which Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi are accused.

 Arguments in the case continued today with special prosecutor L.R. Ansari appearing before the court. ?Recording of evidence and cross-examination of witnesses have concluded. Now the defence is putting forth its arguments,? Ansari told The Telegraph.

 Defence counsel P.N. Pandey, appearing with a battery of lawyers, argued on behalf of Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi.

 The much-discussed case, in which the couple is alleged to have amassed assets disproportionate to their known sources of income between 1990 and 1996, became a talking point yesterday when Supreme Court judge S.N. Variava disclosed that ?someone from the high court? had approached him to find out if the judge concerned could be changed.

 The bombshell revelation was hotly discussed by lawyers at the civil court with everyone speculating about the identity of the person who could have contacted the Supreme Court judge.

 Yogendra Prasad is the fourth judge to preside over the trial of the ?DA (disproportionate assets) case?, which was registered in 1998. Before him S.K. Lal, S.K. Pathak and H.K. Mishra have been judges of the special CBI court.

 Ansari said he had presented his arguments on behalf of the prosecution and was awaiting a verdict. A senior lawyer said that with Justice Variava ruling out the transfer of the CBI court judge, the trial was set to conclude ?quite soon?.

 Defence lawyers have sought adjournments from the court on quite a few occasions but the hearing is now expected to proceed smoothly.

 The income-tax tribunal in Patna has given Laloo Prasad and his wife a ?clean chit? in the matter of their filing of returns for the assessment year 1986-87 to 1996-97.

 In November 1996, Rabri Devi filed income-tax returns for the first time for the long period in one bunch, declaring some earnings belatedly from dairy farming and agriculture. But the income-tax officer did not accept the plea of Rabri Devi and Laloo Prasad.

 After the appeal was rejected, Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi filed a plea with the income-tax tribunal in May 2000.

 A controversial twist was added after the Congress-led alliance, in which Laloo Prasad is a partner, assumed power at the Centre.

 R.K. Tyagi, the member (judicial) in the income-tax tribunal, was transferred to Delhi. Two new members ?one from Calcutta and the other from Bangalore ? were brought in. 

 The tribunal gave a judgment in favour of the couple in June last year. Though the tribunal order went against that of the income-tax commissioner, the department concerned under the Union finance ministry did not file an appeal before the high court.

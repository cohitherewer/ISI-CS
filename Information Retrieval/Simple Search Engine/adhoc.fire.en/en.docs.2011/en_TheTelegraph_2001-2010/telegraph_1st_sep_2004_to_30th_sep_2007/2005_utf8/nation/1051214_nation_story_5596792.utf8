 Quake rerun in Kashmir

 MUKHTAR AHMAD AND AGENCIES

 Srinagar, Dec. 13: Frightened people raced into the freezing open in the dead of night and began chanting from the Quran as the impact of a quake that hit the Hindu Kush mountains coursed through Jammu and Kashmir and parts of Pakistan.

 The 6.8 magnitude tremor struck in thinly-peopled northeast Afghanistan around 3.16 am, generating a frisson of fear in the region where over 73,000 people died in a killer quake on October 8.

 There were no reports of deaths but many houses and makeshift shelters in Uri, Baramullah and Fafiabad in north Kashmir were damaged.

 Pakistan, too, reported neither damage nor death but people scurried out of homes in Islamabad and Peshawar. Scores of houses were damaged and 400 cattle killed in Afghanistan.

 I ran out of the house with my family though it was ?5 degrees Celsius outside. The choice was tough: shiver outside or get back in and wait for another shock.

 We stayed out till sunrise, said Abdul Majid, 45, who lives in the posh Hyderpora locality of Srinagar.

 That the quake was far less lethal than the October killer appeared to make little difference to the people, whose nerves are frayed by memories of the disaster and coping with the aftermath.

 A 26-year-old student Suhail Ahmad of Srinagar gave vent to the general exasper- ation. We have borne the aftershocks of the October 8 quake. Experts said they would continue for two months. Just as we believed those were ending, another shock has occurred.

 Now experts say aftershocks from this quake might continue for some time more.

 Doctors said the October quake and its aftershocks have taken a toll of peoples nerves, with several seeking help for psychosomatic ailments.

 Sleeplessness, nervousness, panic and agitation are some of the complaints I have been getting since the quake. People can suffer for long in the aftermath of seismic turbulence, a physician said.

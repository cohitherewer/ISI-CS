 Gautam in IAS return bid

 Patna: Former Patna district magistrate 

 Gautam Goswami, the main accused in the flood relief scam, 

 on Friday gave a letter to the state government withdrawing 

 his resignation from the IAS, reports our special correspondent.

 Goswamis letter was moved on a day governor Buta Singh said all steps would be taken to nab the bureaucrat and dismissal proceedings would also be initiated against him apparently on the grounds that he had joined a corporate house though his resignation had not been accepted by the government.

 Goswamis lawyer Tuhin Shankar said his client had a rethink since talk of his being dismissed was aired through the media.

 My client sent me a letter withdrawing his resignation and I, accordingly, served it to the personnel secretary. My client is now a full-fledged member of the IAS because his resignation was yet to be accepted by the government. He was fully within his rights to withdraw the resignation, Shankar said.

 The lawyer said Goswami had not surrendered before court as he was seeking anticipatory bail. If the bail is rejected, my client would definitely present himself before the court concerned, said Shankar.

 Earlier in the day, Singh said it was only a matter of time before Goswami was arrested.

 Smoke ban on foreign films

 New Delhi: The censor board will delete 

 all smoking scenes from Indian and foreign films released 

 for screening in the country after October 2 when the governments 

 tough new anti-smoking regulations come into force, reports 

 our special correspondent.

 Information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy said Indian and foreign films will be treated equally and all will have to abide by the countrys regulations if they are to be screened here. There will be a level playing field for all. We cannot have one law for Indian films and another for foreign movies, Reddy said.

 Bollywood heroes and villains will be banned from smoking on screen in any film made after October 2.

 Theatre owners will be responsible for ensuring anti-smoking warnings are displayed when films made before the new guideline comes into force are displayed. It is up to the owners to slip in a placard before or after the film, perhaps not when the scene is shown, Reddy said.

 The government will get stakeholders of the television and film industry, including advertisers, cable operators and theatre owners, to sit down together and discuss the ban on smoking.

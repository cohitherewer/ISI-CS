 Chennai, June 9: A day after returning to the Kanchi Mutt, acharya Jayendra Saraswati faced a round of questioning on some old land deals pertaining to the Jan Kalyan Trust.

 He was grilled by the polices special investigating team (SIT), which is investigating the Shankar Raman murder case as well.

 The Jan Kalyan Trust had been formed by the acharya in the late 1980s to promote welfare activities for people, especially Dalits, sources in Kancheepuram said over phone.

 Bhuvana Easwari, the new chief investigating officer of the SIT handling all mutt-related cases, came to Kancheepuram this afternoon along with two police officials to question the seer after the team received a complaint. 

 The acharya was asked five or six questions to which he replied patiently, the sources said. 

 The SIT has also filed a chargesheet in the second case against Jayendra Saraswati ? he is charged with involvement in the attack on Radhakrishnan, a former mutt aide and a Chennai-based chartered accountant, in September 2002.

 Apart from the seer, 11 persons have been named accused in the case, including Appu, the kingpin of the contract killers allegedly hired to kill Shankar Raman, building contractor Ravi Subramaniam, who later turned approver, Raghu, the junior pontiffs brother, and Sundaresa Iyer, former manager of the Kanchi Mutt.

 The SIT has filed a 600-page chargesheet in the assault case in the 23rd magistrate court in Saidapet here.

 Kancheepuram has been abuzz since last evening after a portion of the ceiling of the records room in the first judicial magistrates court, was found removed. 

 However, all documents on proceedings in the Shankar Raman murder case that were kept in the room had been moved to the Chengalpattu sessions court earlier. Miscreants who had barged into the room allegedly tampered with some records.

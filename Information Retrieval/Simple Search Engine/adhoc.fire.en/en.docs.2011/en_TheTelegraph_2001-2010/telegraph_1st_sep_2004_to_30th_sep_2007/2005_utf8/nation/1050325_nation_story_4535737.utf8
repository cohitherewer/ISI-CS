 Wisdom slick spares Goa

 SUJAN DUTTA

 The Wisdom and the Prapti

New Delhi, March 24: The oil slick from the 

ruptured tank of a Singaporean cargo vessel that threatened a marine reserve off 

the Goa coast yesterday has floated south of the protected zone after it was reduced 

to a sheen with dispersants sprayed by the Coast Guard.

 The Union ministries of environment and forests, tourism and defence and the Goa government sought continuous updates from the Coast Guard and assurances that the oil slick would not touch the coastline. The upshot was that the Coast Guard?s western headquarters in Mumbai was wholly taken up with the operation.

 The navy was concerned that the slick was floating south, towards the coast of Karwar where its latest base, Project Seabird, is due for commissioning shortly. The sheen of oil was some 45 miles north from Karwar and was expected to dissipate before it was in the base?s vicinity.

 The Coast Guard advised the Goa government and the Mormugao Port Trust that the fishing community should be warned against picking catches of mackerel, sardines, pomfret, catfish, kingfish, shrimp, squids, cuttlefish and some 30 other species of marine life from the zone through which the oil has floated. These species are much sought after in the area.

 But Coast Guard vessels at the spot reported that fishing continued ?as usual?.

 The government has asked the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa to carry out an environment impact assessment after the Coast Guard said the chemical dispersants were breaking up the oil into granular nodules. Coast Guard sources said even if much of the oil was dissipating, tar balls of oil could surface weeks later.

 This evening, the spill of furnace fuel oil was reported by Coast Guard Dornier aircraft and patrol vessels to be a ?film? that has broken into three or four patches spread over a two-to-three square mile area, 6 nautical miles from the coastline of south Goa.

 The sources estimated that the sheen was made up of about a tonne of oil. More than 100 tonnes had gushed out of the leak in the fuel tank of the MV Maritime Wisdom after a barge, the Prapti, ruptured it around 1 am yesterday in the anchorage of Mormugao port. 

 Coast Guard headquarters in Delhi were receiving continuous updates from the aircraft and the patrol craft at the spot. The ocean current was taking the slick in a south-southeasterly direction at less than 1 nautical mile an hour.

 They reported that at 8.15 this morning, the slick was 8 nautical miles west of Kolva in south Goa. By 5 pm, the sheen was 6.5 miles from Fatrade. It had floated nearly 20 nautical miles from where the ship is anchored off Fort Aguada in north Goa.

 The operation was likely to be called off tomorrow morning. The aircraft stopped spraying the chemical dispersants at sundown today.

 Muivah salvo at Delhi on talks-eve

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Bangkok, Dec. 15: On the eve of the next round of peace negotiations with representatives of New Delhi, Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), alleged that the Indian government was spurning the Naga hand of friendship.

 We Nagas have extended our hand of friendship and India is putting conditions before accepting it. Is this wise? Can we keep coming back again and again, demanding friendship from India? Do Nagas have no honour? Muivah asked.

 Signalling that the Naga talks were entering a turbulent zone, Muivah claimed that in the last six months of the ceasefire, there has been no progress from the Indian side.

 In fact, he alleged that some elements in India were trying to drive the NSCN (I-M) back to war. However, he said: They should know the truth ? that neither the NSCN nor the Nagas will ever bow down under threats.

 Muivah claimed: Even shortening the ceasefire period to six months has not brought the government of India to focus on the issue. Its approach seems to be ad hoc and its vision limited to how to get from one ceasefire extension to the next. But can we go on like this? A ceasefire is a means to an end and not the end in itself.

 He claimed that almost double the number of NSCN (I-M) cadres had been killed in the eight years of the ceasefire than in the preceding eight years of active engagement.

 Muivah charged that there was a wide gap between the words and deeds of Indian political leaders on the Naga issue. Top leaders in India ? Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Shivraj Patil ? tell us of their sincerity but unfortunately, they dont admit the ugly ground reality of the activities of the Indian armed forces and intelligence agencies, he said.

 By contrast, he claimed: There is no difference between what we say and what we do ? we have taken bold steps to bring the Nagas close to India but India seems to be spurning us. That is where the problem lies.

 Taking stock of the present state of the peace talks, Muivah remarked that there seemed to be no meeting point between the government of India and the NSCN (I-M) today. He said that in the last eight years of the ceasefire, India had given neither a road map nor a time frame for a settlement. 

 Now we are wondering whether it has been worth our while to have come so far, he said.

 Muivah said that if the Nagas were asked to go beyond what was acceptable and honourable, then they would have no option but to surmise that Indias current leadership does not really want a solution.

 The Naga leader asked: Is proposing a negotiated federal relationship wrong? Is it wrong for the Nagas to want to live together in a single political unit? Are we wrong to want a close relationship with India? And if we do this through dialogue, is that also wrong?

 That the peace negotiations were moving into a blame game was clear when Muivah said: The real intention of the government of India is to destroy the righteous cause of the Nagas, treacherously using Naga renegades who have no support among the people.

 The NSCN leadership, he claimed, was not responsible for the present situation. If I have not done enough to understand the position of the government of India or its constraints, then I should be blamed for merely talking big. But we are sure that we have done the best we could to address all issues of Indias apprehension.

 I will go by the truth I know. I will neither betray heaven nor earth. I will not betray the Naga people or the truth I know. I will not dishonour myself and the Nagas, Muivah declared.

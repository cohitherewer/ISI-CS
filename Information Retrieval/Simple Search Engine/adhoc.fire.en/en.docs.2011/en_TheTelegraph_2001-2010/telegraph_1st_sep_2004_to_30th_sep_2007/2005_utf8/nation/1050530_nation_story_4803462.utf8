 Indian gets a planet in his name

 Mumbai, May 29 (PTI): Bhushan Mahadik is sharing space with Einstein and Marie Curie somewhere in the solar system.

 Americas MIT Lincoln Laboratory last week renamed minor planet 17095 as Mahadik Planet in recognition of the Indian students achievement as a finalist in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Ohio two years ago.

 Mahadik, an alumnus of Fr Agnel Junior College at Navi Mumbai, is now an undergraduate student at Berkeley, the US, said the principal of the Mumbai college, Fr S. Almeida.

 Minor planets represent material left over from the time the solar system was formed ? most likely matter that never coalesced into a planet because of Jupiters gravitational influence.

 Ever since the first minor planet was discovered in 1801 and named Ceres after the Roman goddess, about a fifth of the discovered minor planets have been named after people.

 Two other Indian students have had minor planets named after them. So have celebrities like Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and the Beatles.

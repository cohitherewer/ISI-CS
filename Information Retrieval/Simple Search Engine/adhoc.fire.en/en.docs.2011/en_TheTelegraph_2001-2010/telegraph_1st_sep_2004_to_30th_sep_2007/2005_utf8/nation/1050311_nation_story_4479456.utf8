 Hostels to chant meal mantras 

 Jaipur (PTI): Ignoring all opposition, 

 the recitation of the Vedic Bhojan Mantra before meals has 

 been formally introduced in all hostels run by the social 

 welfare department of the Rajasthan government. 

 The recitation by the hostel inmates has been made compulsory under new rules issued recently by the department, official sources said.

 The rules were issued after the panchayat polls last month, the sources added.

 There was a hue and cry when social welfare minister Madan Dilawar announced last year that recitation of the Bhojan Mantra would be made compulsory for inmates of the hostels run by his department.

 Although no orders were issued last year, the mantra was made compulsory in the hostels informally, the sources said.

 Several human rights and Left organisations had opposed the move, saying that it would saffronise the hostel environment.

 Corrupt minister quits

 Mumbai: Nationalist Congress Party leader 

 Suresh Jain resigned from the Democratic Front government 

 on Thursday after an inquiry commission found him guilty 

 of corruption, reports our special correspondent.

 Jain, Maharashtra?s minister for technical and higher education, is among four ministers indicted by the Justice P.B. Sawant Commission, which investigated charges made by anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare. 

 Jain?s resignation comes a day after the Vilasrao Deshmukh cabinet decided to table the commission report in the Assembly session beginning on Monday.

 The Sushil Kumar Shinde government had appointed the one-man commission on September 1, 2003, after Hazare staged a hunger strike demanding a probe into corruption charges against the four ministers.

 Hazare had charged Jain with misappropriation of funds in the Jalgaon district cooperative bank when he was its director.

 Film ban appeal

 Mumbai (PTI): The Kerala Catholic Association 

 has claimed that the controversial film Sins has 

 been banned in Jammu and Kashmir and urged other states

 had undertaken a protest drive in Maharashtra. Bombay High 

 Court had dismissed a plea for a stay on the film.

 effect on the population.

Tremors

 Colachel (PTI): It is a herculean task that Blossom, a non-government 

organisation based in Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu, has taken up. 

 The Blossom team has been asked, without adhering to any written script, to enthrall tsunami survivors of the coastal hamlets in the area. They sing, dance and try to make the survivors participate in their programmes.

 They seem to be succeeding. For the survivors from Kottilpadu, camping inside a marriage hall here, a vaudeville performed by Igshanullah and Muthulakshmi on Thursday came as a comic relief amid the tragedy all around.

 The duo stopped the performance for a while and asked the attentive audience, consisting mostly of women and children, to sing. Initially, there was no response. The two started singing again and a little girl began to dance to the tune, lighting up the faces of all the children there. ?It is for the first time that I am seeing them laugh like this in the last few days,? a volunteer said.

 Nagapattinam (PTI): The future of a 17-year-old student from Akkaraipet 

village looks gloomy after he lost all his textbooks in the tsunami. Balamurugan, 

a Class-X student, lost his books and certificates when the waves lashed his fishing 

hamlet. ?I lost all my text and note books. I don?t know whether I will be able 

to appear for the public exam,? he says. The tsunami has also destroyed his family?s 

only boat.

 Bangkok (AFP): Two Thai naval officers have credited the spirit of a 

late prince with saving them when the tsunami struck a naval base, the Bangkok 

Post reported on Friday. They clung to the statue of Prince Chumphon Khet 

Udomsak, the founder of the royal Thai navy, as tsunamis swept the Phangnga naval 

base. ?I did not know where to run. Then I saw the statue of Sadej Tia (the prince)... 

So I climbed up and held his left leg as firmly as I could and prayed for his 

help,? petty officer Thananchai Phaewket told the paper. He believed he would 

be safe as he was wearing an amulet of the prince. His colleague Witthawin Manapattanawong 

soon joined him and clung to the statue?s right leg until the water receded.

 New Delhi/Dhaka (Agencies): An earthquake jolted the border areas of Myanmar and India on Friday, less than 14 hours after a similar tremor shook the region. The quake measured 4.5 on the Richter scale. An earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale also jolted southeastern Bangladesh on Friday.

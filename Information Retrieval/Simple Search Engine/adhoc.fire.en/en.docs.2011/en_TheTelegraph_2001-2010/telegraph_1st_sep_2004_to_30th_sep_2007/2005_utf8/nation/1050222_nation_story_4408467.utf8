 Haryana ballot before SC 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: Counting of votes in Haryana, scheduled to be held tomorrow, now hangs in balance following a petition filed in the Supreme Court for inclusion of postal ballots. 

 Zile Singh, a candidate of the ruling Indian National Lok Dal, petitioned the court to postpone the counting of votes from February 23 to February 27, to include nearly one lakh postal ballots. 

 The court has fixed the hearing on the issue tomorrow. 

 Singh?s petition contended that ?either the entire process? takes place on February 23 or if the counting takes off on that date ?then results should not be declared till? February 28 ?to take care of the postal ballots?.

 The Election Commission fixed February 23 for counting of votes, following which chief minister Om Prakash Chautala said that T.S.Krishnamurthy had lost his ?mental balance? and that the chief election comissioner knew how to only count currency notes and not votes.

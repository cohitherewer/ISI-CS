 Sunil charge

 Mumbai, May 8 (PTI): Union minister Sunil Dutt tonight attacked the Congress decision to induct former Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Nirupam into the party, saying Sonia Gandhi had not been given correct information about him.

 The sports minister, who had defeated Nirupam in last years Lok Sabha election, said the party president had not been told that the former Shiv Sainik had called thespian Dilip Kumar a ?traitor?. 

 ?If Sonia Gandhi knew the truth about Sanjay Nirupam and if she had been given correct information about him, she would not have taken into the party fold a tainted person like him,? he said. 

 Dutt said Sonia was being ?misguided? with ?incorrect? information that he had agreed to the induction. ?If I had agreed to his induction, I would have been the first to accord him a reception here,? Dutt said at a meeting organised by the North Mumbai district Congress to express support for the actor-turned-politician.

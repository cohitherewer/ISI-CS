 Mind meet kicks off

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, March 7: The three-day national conference of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology began at Magadh University this morning.

 More than 200 delegates are participating in the meet, being held in Bihar for the first time. Governor Buta Singh, who was earlier scheduled to inaugurate the conference, could not make it on account of his preoccupations in Patna.

 Inaugurating the conference, vice-chancellor Shamshad Hussain exhorted the community of applied psychologists to gear themselves up and meet the new challenges in the wake of high mobility, globalisation and other socio-political developments that have taken place in the past few years.

 Setting the agenda for the academic discourse, Hussain said the function of an applied psychologist is to bring ?happiness to the unhappy? and convert the ?happy people? into ?more happy ones?. 

 He further said stress-related problems affect inter-personal relationships as well as the social order. A combination of factors, which include stress and strain, competition, ambition and a long wishlist, adversely affect relationships, the vice-chancellor added.

 Punjab University professor and president of the conference Jitendra Mohan said applied psychology may have a ?very short history? but it has a ?very long past?. 

 Habibur Rahman, director of the conference, told The Telegraph that a special session would exclusively deal with the psychological rehabilitation of tsunami survivors.

 The participants will deliberate on a number of issues, including quality of life in the context of globalisation, stress and crisis management, AIDS ? prevention and rehabilitation, social changes in the past 10 years, inter-personal and inter-community relationships and problems of the disadvantaged in the country.

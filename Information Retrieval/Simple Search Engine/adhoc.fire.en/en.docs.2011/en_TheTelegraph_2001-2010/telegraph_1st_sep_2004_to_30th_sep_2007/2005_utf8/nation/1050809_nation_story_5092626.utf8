 Flood fuel to water war

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Aug. 8: A war of words between Maharashtra and Karnataka over floods in border districts could well invite the intervention of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and has added a twist to the row over sharing the water of the Krishna river.

 The riparian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have in the past clashed over sharing the rivers water.

 This year, the Maharashtra government has blamed Karnataka for the inundation of Kolhapur and Sangli districts. Deputy Maharashtra chief minister chief minister R.R. Patil has accused the Karnataka government of storing water in the Almatti dam, rather than releasing it and preventing floods in the border areas.

 Today, Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh asked the Prime Minister to verify the facts on the water level in the Almatti dam.

 We are expecting the Prime Minister to conduct an aerial survey. Union home minister Shivraj Patil will visit the border areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka on Tuesday, he said after reviewing the flood havoc in Bagalkot, Belgaum, Bijapur and Gulbarga.

 The excessive release of water has led to great loss in Karnataka and yet Maharashtra accuses us of causing loss to that state, the chief minister said. 

 Singh said Maharashtra had released water from not only Koyna but reservoirs in Warna, Doddaganga, Ujani and Veerbhatkal. We have clinching evidence to prove that Maharashtra is releasing far more water from Koyna and falsely informing Karnataka that only about 10,000 to 30,000 cusecs of water is released, he said.

 The state government will seek an aid of Rs 1, 037 crore for relief operations in flood-hit areas.

 Deputy Karnataka chief minister M.P. Prakash, who replaced Siddaramaiah, said unscientific and reckless releases by engineers of Maharashtras irrigation department led to flooding in the border areas.The charge that the backwater build up in Maharashtra areas is because of higher reservoir level in Almatti is untrue, he said.

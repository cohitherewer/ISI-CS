 Malaysian boss abuses Sikhs 

 New Delhi (PTI): Eighteen Sikh workers from India were humiliated by their employer in Malaysia who allegedly forced three of them to cut their hair and forbade them from wearing the turban, the Lok Sabha was told on Wednesday.

 The workers were also deprived of food and money. They fled further abuse by taking shelter in a gurdwara in August last year, minister of state for external affairs E. Ahamed said. Eleven of them have returned home. 

 Delhi took the matter up with the Malaysian foreign office, expressing grave concern at the incident and seeking urgent intervention.

 A case was filed in the Malaysian labour court against the employer. Hearing has been postponed several times with the employer pleading illness.

 The Indian high commissioner has met Malaysian authorities and requested them to speed up the process of redressing the Sikh workers grievance, Ahamed said.

 Ailing Indian freed of charge

 Dubai (PTI): A car rental company in Bahrain has decided to withdraw an eight-year-old case against an ailing Indian so that he could return home for treatment.

 The Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society had appealed to the company to drop the case after the 44-year-old was diagnosed with acute renal failure.

 Indian expatriates in the country have been raising funds to send Balakrishnan back home.

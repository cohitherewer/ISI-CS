 Hit on Imphal railway office 

 KHELEN THOKCHOM

 Imphal, April 24: Script activists struck in Imphal again last night, targeting the railway reservation centre here with a petrol bomb that left most of it gutted. 

 The arson, which occurred after midnight on Saturday, virtually cut off the state?s only railway link from the rest of the country. Manipur?s rail track begins at Jiribam near Assam. 

 A team of railway officials is scheduled to arrive from Maligaon in Guwahati ? the headquarters of Northeast Frontier Railways ? to decide on the fate of the reservation centre. 

 Police said volunteers of the Meitei Erol Eyek Loinasillon Apunba Lup, which is spearheading the Meitei script movement, torched the office building of the passenger reservation centre by hurling a petrol bomb inside one of the three counters shortly after midnight. It is located inside the State Road Transport Corporation complex here.

 The bomb sparked a fire, which destroyed all the three counters. Five fire-tenders battled the inferno for nearly an hour before it was brought under control. 

 Reservation officials today said the blaze has destroyed the facilities for booking railway reservations from here. Records, furniture, computer systems were damaged and Rs 30,000 in cash lost. Officials said reservation of tickets would not be possible until the system was restored, which is likely to take some time. Police had a tough time cordoning off the area.

 Transport minister Pheiroijam Parijat Singh visited the spot in the morning. The minister said the state government would request the railway authorities to restore the facilities as soon as possible.

 Pro-Meitei script activists had burned down the state?s central library here on April 13. The arson evoked angry reactions, but the activists are unfazed. The organisation has been demanding change of script from Bengali to Meitei Mayek from this academic session. 

 The latest attack exposed the lacunae in security arrangements for protecting government offices and other important installations in and around Imphal. 

 Sources said only three unarmed homeguards were deployed at the reservation centre during daytime and there was no security guard during the night. 

 The attack came just a few hours after chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh said his government would not act hastily while implementing the script. 

 Addressing a state function at Khongjom in Thoubal district yesterday, Ibobi Singh said he would first discuss it with all communities and ethnic groups in Manipur before taking any decision on the script switch. 

 The banned Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) iterated its threat to target all the ministers and MLAs from next month if they failed to resolve the script issue. Script activists, now lodged in Sajiwa Jail, announced that they would launch a fast-unto-death from May 1 if the government failed to concede their demand.

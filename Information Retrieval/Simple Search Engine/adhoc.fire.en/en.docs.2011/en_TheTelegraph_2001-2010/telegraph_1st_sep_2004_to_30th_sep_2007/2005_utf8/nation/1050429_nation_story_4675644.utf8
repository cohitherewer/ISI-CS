 Notice to raise medical quota

 New Delhi: The all-India students? quota 

 for MBBS and BDS admissions might be increased to 25 per 

 cent from the existing 15 per cent, if the Centre and states 

 listen to a Supreme Court suggestion, reports our legal 

 correspondent. 

 The apex court on Thursday sent notices to the Centre, all the states and Union territories seeking their reply in a week.Only Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim and Goa have filed their responses.

 The division bench also sought an explanation from the states why Class XII results could not be declared by June 10 so that the confusion over admissions to professional colleges could be cleared.

 It pointed out that a majority of the states had not filed replies to its earlier direction on these two suggestions. The next hearing has been fixed on May 13.

 The case has been brought to the court by a student, Mridul Dhar, seeking a directive to fill up the all-India quota, where a few seats ?invariably? remain vacant. Then the states concerned and managements of the professional colleges ?wage a legal war? on who should fill up the seats. By the time the case is decided, one academic year is almost over.

 The apex court had on January 12 ruled that Class XII results should be declared by June 10 every year to enable students to compete in entrance examinations for professional courses.

 US adds Ulfa to terror list

 New Delhi/ Washington: The Ulfa and a 

 Naxalite outfit, the Communist Party of India (Maoist), 

 have been declared terrorist organisations by the US, reports 

 our bureau. 

 In its 2004 Country Reports on Terrorism released yesterday, the US state department added both the outfits to the Other Selected Terrorist Organisations (OSTO) list. 

 The Ulfa was added to the OSTO list since it was continuing to target civilians. The report refers to the outfit as the ?most prominent insurgent group in India?s Northeast?, and noted the Ulfa?s use of extortion to finance military training, weapons purchase and trade in arms with other ethnic insurgent groups active in the region. 

 Mentioning the Ulfa?s links with Pakistan?s Inter-Services Intelligence and the Directorate-General of Field Intelligence of Bangladesh, the report said the outfit was carrying out its agenda to further destabilise the disturbed Northeast. 

 However, by naming the Ulfa and the Communist Party of India (Maoist) in its reports, the state department?s action has only buttressed the frequent complaints of US double standards on terrorism.

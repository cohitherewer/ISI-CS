 Junior doctors on pay strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, May 6: Junior doctors of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) have decided to go on an indefinite strike from midnight today. 

 The doctors had been demanding implementation of the hike in their stipend, as was agreed upon by the government last year, and proper hostel accommodation on the college campus.

 Strikes by students and nurses had paralysed medical services at the hospital on a number of occasions. Talks with the government temporarily solved the crisis every time, with the students hoping that the assurances will be translated into action.

 ?We feel cheated again and again. The government is not serious about our just demands. Lets see if the governor takes up our case now,? a junior doctor said. 

 The doctors alleged that their stipend was much lower than what their counterparts in other medical colleges got. Last month, chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam assured the students that their demands will be ?considered sympathetically? and without any delay.

 In another incident today, nurses of PMCH demonstrated against the dismissal of two colleagues for alleged negligence of duty.

 Womens bill hits consumer clause

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: A tussle is on between womens groups and voluntary organisations regarding the ambit of a bill the government wants to introduce to protect women from sexual harassment at the workplace.

 The Centre wants to pass the bill in the winter session of Parliament beginning November 23.

 The point being debated is whether the bill should include women consumers in its definition of complainants besides women employees in any workplace. We believe the bill should also cover women consumers who have to access services of doctors or lawyers. This means a woman consumer should have a redress machinery she can turn to if she is harassed by a doctor in a clinic or by a lawyer in his chamber, said a member of the Lawyers Collective, an NGO instrumental in drawing up the draft bill.

 A two-day discussion on the bill at a workshop recently, however, revealed differences between the All India Democratic Womens Association and the Lawyers Collective.

 The womens association does not want the bill to include consumers. It said widening the ambit of the bill would dilute it and so the bill should be strictly kept within an employer-employee framework. 

 The Lawyers Collective does not agree. A bill for protecting women against sexual violence at the workplace should not leave out consumers who are often sexually harassed at places they have to go to for their services, said a member. We believe the bill should cover all workplace relations and not just relations between employers and employees, she added.

 The draft bill says: No employer, supervisor or co-employee can sexually harass a woman who is present at the workplace in connection with her work.

 The Consumer Protection Act at present gives consumers the right to move court against a person who is guilty of deficiency in services at a service centre.

 The Lawyers Collective wants to include sexual harassment as part of deficiency and misconduct in service. It has suggested two redress mechanisms ? one, an internal inquiry committee for the employees that would look into their complaints and a complaints committee that customers can access.

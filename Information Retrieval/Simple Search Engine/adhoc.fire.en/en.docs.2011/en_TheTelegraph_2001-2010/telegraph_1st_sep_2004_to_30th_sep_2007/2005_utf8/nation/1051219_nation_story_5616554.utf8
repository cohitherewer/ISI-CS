 Valley shivers minus power

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Dec. 18: Electricity, the elusive guest in Kashmiri homes, is playing truant when the Valley is suffering one of its severest winters in recent times.

 For the 1.2 million residents in the states summer capital, lack of electricity means no power for light and heating systems at home. There has been no electricity in our locality for the last 12 hours and the authorities have issued advisories saying power would remain off for the entire Sunday, said Ghulam Hassan, who stays in the old city area.

 Earlier, the public distribution department used to supply firewood to residents during the winter months. That was stopped to protect the dwindling forest cover... It is depressing especially during the evenings with outside temperatures falling to minus 6.3 degrees Celsius, said college teacher Muzaffar Ahmad.

 But with a steep shortfall in generation and losses incurred by buying power, the electricity departments situation seems hopeless.

 The total availability of power at present is around 700 MW. This includes internal generation and buying from the Northern Power Grid. Our daily requirement is around 1,100 MW. That leaves us with a deficit of 400 MW, said a department engineer.

 Also, the cost of buying power is leading to huge losses. We buy power at anything between Rs 4 and Rs 7 a unit but supply to our consumers at a flat rate of Rs 1.87 a unit. That is a huge loss, which means the more we buy or generate, the more the losses, another engineer rued.

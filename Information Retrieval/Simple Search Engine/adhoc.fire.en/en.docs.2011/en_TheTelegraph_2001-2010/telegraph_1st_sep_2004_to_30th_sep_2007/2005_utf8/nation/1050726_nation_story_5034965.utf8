 JNU doors reopen for madarsa pupils 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, July 25: The Jawaharlal Nehru University has taken back its controversial decision to reject admission to madarsa students. 

 The university administration said the decision, taken on Friday, was a mistake and had also been misinterpreted. We have been admitting madarsa students for over 15 years. There has been no change in admission policy or procedure, said Harjit Singh, JNUs director of admissions.

 Most, however, see the turnaround as a result of the demand of the powerful students and teachers unions to maintain the varsitys secular image.

 An equivalence committee scans madarsa degrees of admission seekers every year to check if their education matches that of the Class XII degree. The committee is believed to have recommended this year that madarsa students be denied admission.

 Several students from madarsas apply to JNU for religious studies and languages after having studied for a year in Aligarh Muslim University or Jamia Milia Islamia. This year, some were apparently told to go back as their Amiliyat Fazeelat madarsa degrees were not adequate.

 While some teachers and students feel todays announcement may have come too late to prevent JNUs secular credentials from being tarnished, madarsa students heaved a sigh of relief.

 I am so relieved to find out that I can study here, said Faiz-ur-Rehman, who has applied for the German studies undergraduate programme. 

 The madarsa students cannot fathom why the controversy arose at all. When the departments we had applied to recommended us for admission, why should the equivalence committee suddenly find a problem? asked Rehman.

 Professor Kamal Mitra Chenoy, of the JNU Teachers Association, said: It is really sad that the students had to go through the trauma of not knowing if they were eligible to study here.

 He added: The equivalence committee never found problems with madarsa students before. JNUs secular image has definitely been tainted.

 According to university officials, the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), which recognises all central and state boards, had this year written to them, advising them against accepting madarsa degrees. The AIU does not recognise madarsa education as equivalent to a 12th class degree. However, since AMU and Jamia are central universities of repute, we will accept their students, said Singh.

 The administration clarified that the initial decision to ban madarsa students was not due to political considerations. Secular education is the hallmark of JNU, said acting students dean V.K. Jain.

 Tycoons line up at CPM door

 Karat, Swraj Paul: Business first 

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The CPM ? the party of the working class ? has been fraternising with top capitalists at its headquarters in New Delhi.

 The richest among the rich in India are dropping by at AK Gopalan Bhavan which they now see as a destination they must visit to further their business interests.

 During the last fortnight, party general secretary Prakash Karat and his junior Sitaram Yechury have met three top industrialists ? Reliance Industries chief Mukesh Ambani and steel magnates Lakshmi Mittal and Swraj Paul. According to sources, all three came to discuss economic policies, UPA-Left coordination and their investments in India.

 Last week it was Mittal and Paul who landed at the CPM office and had a chat with Karat. Lakshmi Mittal wanted a discussion on what he is doing in India. He explained that he has started investing in India and wanted to tell us about it, Karat said. 

 Mittal discussed with the CPM general secretary the steel plant project he is planning in Jharkhand. According to some party leaders, the Lefts recent opposition to a steel project by a Korean company in Orissa prompted Mittal to keep the Left in the know about his plans.

 UK-based Paul was the next to call on Karat, along with a team of British MPs. He was interested in knowing about the UPA-Left coordination framework. 

 Yesterday, Ambani of Reliance ? a group the CPM has never been particularly fond of ? met Yechury at the party office. Karat said he does not know what the hour-long meeting was about. He met Sitaram. He (Sitaram) just told me that Mukesh Ambani had come. But I do not know what they spoke about, said Karat. You will have to ask Sitaram about the meeting.

 Yechury was unavailable for comment. But sources said Ambani has a series of projects lined up for Bengal and wanted to discuss them with Yechury, who is also a Rajya Sabha MP from the state. 

 CPM sources said there was nothing unusual about the meetings. Ambani has met the Congress leadership and Mittal and Paul have sought meetings with CPI secretary A.B. Bardhan, they added.

 The meetings with the three tycoons are in line with the CPMs makeover from a dogmatic party to one willing to change with time. The visiting industrialists are keen to gauge the mood in the party as they try to assess how far it would back reforms and whether the party or its trade union wing, Citu, would be a hurdle for their future projects.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has made their job easy. He is already doing what the industrialists want ? cracking the whip on Citu. The CPMs central leadership is also backing the chief minister. 

 For both Bhattacharjee and the CPM leadership in Delhi, the crucial issue seems to be to send a positive signal to the business community and refrain from taking any step that could jeopardise investment prospects in Bengal.

 Pak asks for tents, copters

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Oct. 15: As relief and rescue work in Pakistans quake-hit regions entered the seventh day, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said an international donors conference will be held in Geneva next week to take stock of the damage.

 The conference is being organised by the United Nations, which has revised its initial flash appeal of $272 million to $300 million, he told a news conference in Islamabad, hours after local and international relief teams temporarily suspended operations because of bad weather.

 Financial pledges made by the international community for quake-ravaged areas rose to $500 million.

 Pakistan today raised the official death toll to 38,000. President Pervez Musharraf said he was unsure whether army rescuers had reached all affected areas and added more bodies could be found once routes into the Jhelum and Neelum valleys were cleared of landslides.

 I think it is going to rise, he told reporters after his aides released the latest toll.

 Aziz said a preliminary assessment of the damage had been carried out. 

 The overall assessment ? government, private sector and infrastructure ? would be close to $5 billion, the Prime Minister, who earlier this week said Pakistan would rebuild towns and cities, added.

 Aziz also launched a fresh appeal for at least 300,000 tents and an additional two dozen helicopters, saying the first snowfall in northern Pakistan and the Kashmir region in the last 24 hours made the need for shelter even more pressing. 

 Militants hit

 The Indian Army today said militant groups based in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir have suffered big losses in the quake, reports our special correspondent in Delhi.

 According to the director general of military operations, Lt Gen. Madan Gopal, the Hizb-ul Mujahideen has suffered maximum losses followed by the Lashkar-e-Toiba.

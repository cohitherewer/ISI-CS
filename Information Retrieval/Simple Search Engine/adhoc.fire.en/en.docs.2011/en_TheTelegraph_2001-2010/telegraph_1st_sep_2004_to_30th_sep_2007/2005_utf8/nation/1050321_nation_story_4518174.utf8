 Kashi priest seeks temple asset probe

 Varanasi, March 20 (PTI): A former priest of the Kashi Vishwanath Mandir has demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into alleged embezzlement of the temple?s properties, accusing its management of concealing 99 kg in gold and other assets.

 However, the Kashi Vishwanath management committee CEO, R.P. Pandey, said the priest, Kulpati Tiwari, was unnecessarily trying to create a controversy over the temple?s assets and that the ?CBI is welcome to probe any irregularities?.

 Tiwari today said the committee has not made public the temple?s assets, along with its regular income through chadhawa (offerings made to the deity) and other properties.

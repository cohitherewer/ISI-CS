 Jaya skips court date

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, March 14: A special court appointed to hear a case of unaccounted wealth against Jayalalithaa adjourned the trial till March 28 even as the Tamil Nadu chief minister skipped the first session today. 

 The ADMK leader?s counsel, N. Jyothi, filed a personal appearance exemption request to Justice A.S. Pachhapure on the ground that she had to attend the budget session of the Tamil Nadu Assembly in Chennai. 

 Three others ? Sasikala Natarajan, MP T.T.V. Dinakaran and Illavarasi ? also sought the court?s permission to skip today?s proceedings. Dinakaran?s lawyer told the court that his client had to attend the Rajya Sabha session. Jayalalithaa?s relative V.N. Sudharakan, however, turned up along with a team of lawyers.

 The judge adjourned the case till March 28 following Jyothi?s plea for sufficient time to check the translation, from Tamil to English, of all documents and records. 

 Justice Pachhapure initially agreed to grant 10 days for perusal of the translated copies, but settled for 14 days when Jayalalithaa?s counsel pleaded for three weeks.

 B.V. Acharya, the special public prosecutor, objected to grant of three weeks and insisted on resuming the trial forthwith, as only the presiding officer had changed following the transfer of the case from Chennai by the Supreme Court on November 19, 2003.

 Jayalalithaa is accused of accumulating Rs 65.66 crore during her tenure as chief minister between 1991 and 1996.

 Despite her absence, the court hall was packed with ADMK activists, advocates and journalists. The city police force, deployed around the city court complex, screened people seeking entry into the court hall to keep away onlookers and ADMK workers.

 During the trial, over 70 witnesses are likely to be cross-examined along with the display of at least 3,000 exhibits, including jewellery and documents relating to some important transactions.

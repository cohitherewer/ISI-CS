 Gold merchant gunned down

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 20: The crime graph continued to soar in the state capital with the killing of gold merchant Yogeshwar Dayal on Nala Road under Kadam Kuan police station this morning.

 Dayal, his wife Saroj and two employees of his shop, Swarna Mandir Jewellery, were travelling in his Fiat when four motorcycle-borne criminals accosted the group and shot at the jeweller around 8 am. They also looted gold ornaments worth Rs 5 lakh from the car.

 Dayal had gone to the railway station to receive the employees who returned from Mumbai with the gold ornaments. ?Dayal, aged about 60, was hit by a single bullet in his chest. The gang looted the gold from the trunk of the car and escaped,? a police source said. 

 Some policemen, who were on a vehicle-checking drive nearby, rushed to the spot and took Dayal to Patna Medical College and Hospital. But the gold merchant died on the way.

 Police have detained the two employees for interrogation. ?We are trying to establish how the assailants knew that there was gold in the car,? a police official said. Senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan said, ?The motive of the criminals is not yet clear.?

 A source said members of the Rakesh Singh gang, accused of abducting the gold merchant?s son in May 2003, had been threatening the family of dire consequences. Singh is out on bail at present.

 Information bill under scanner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: Aruna Roy and Jean Dreze of the National Advisory Council are set to turn the glare on ?flaws? in the right to information and employment guarantee bills when the council meets tomorrow.

 They will also demand that certain features of the draft bills that they had worked upon be incorporated.

 Roy said if the government fails to respond, she and Dreze will have to consider whether it is worth continuing in the council, which was created to oversee the implementation of the UPA government?s common minimum programme. 

 Roy?s objection to the right to information bill is that it applies only to the Union government. This essentially means that if a person wants to know whether funds promised by the Centre have reached a state, he/she will have to travel all the way to Delhi to access the sources and documents.

 Dreze, described the employment guarantee bill as a ?legally-wrapped ordinary employment scheme? devoid of safeguards inherent in a full-fledged employment guarantee act. She said the safeguards include universal eligibility, inalienable work entitlement and a guaranteed minimum wage.

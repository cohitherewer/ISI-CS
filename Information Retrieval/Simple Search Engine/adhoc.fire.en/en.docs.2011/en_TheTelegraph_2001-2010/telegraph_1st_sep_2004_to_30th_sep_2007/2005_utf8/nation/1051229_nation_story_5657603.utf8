 Defection bill in J amp;K House 

 BINOO JOSHI

 Jammu, Dec. 28: The Jammu and Kashmir government today introduced the anti-defection bill in the Assembly.

 The legislation, which was tabled with two other bills, provides for immediate disqualification of members who have quit the parties on whose tickets they contested elections. It also forbids them from becoming ministers till the term of the House is over.

 A host of leaders have defected to other parities, falling to the lure of a place in the council of ministers.

 The second bill introduced today seeks to downsize the ministry to only 20 per cent of the total strength of the two Houses.

 With the third legislation, the state government gets the power to attach, seize and take over properties of officials found guilty of corruption.

 All the three bills were introduced by deputy chief minister Muzaffar Hussain Beig, who also has the law and parliamentary portfolio.

 The move, expected to change the political landscape of Jammu and Kashmir, came after the main Opposition party, the National Conference (NC), decided to offer full support to the government on the bills.

 The NCs backing was a must as the combined strength of the Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party, the two major ruling coalition partners, is 37 ? 21 short of 58, two-thirds of the Assemblys strength. In the upper House, too, the NC occupies more than 40 per cent of 36 seats.

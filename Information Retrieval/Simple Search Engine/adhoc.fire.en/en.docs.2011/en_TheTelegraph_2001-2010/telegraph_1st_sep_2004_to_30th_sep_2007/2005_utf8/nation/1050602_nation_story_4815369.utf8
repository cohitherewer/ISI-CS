 465 child workers rescued in Mumbai

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 1: In a massive operation coordinated with several city-based non-government organisations, Mumbai police today rescued 465 children working in exploitative conditions from industrial units located in the congested Madanpura locality in central Mumbai.

 The children will be escorted back to their homes in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, and even Nepal on a directive from the juvenile justice court in the city.

 Hundreds of children, most below 18 years of age, packed the courtyard of the zone III office of additional commissioner Subodh Jaiswal after they were rescued this morning from 226 units. 

 They were employed in leather factories, bag-making factories, zari weaving units, and steel buffing factories, the police said.

 The rescue operation was supervised by DCP Santosh Rastogi along with an assistant commissioner, a senior inspector, 30 inspectors, 170 constables.

 The number of children rescued came as a shock for most, including joint commissioner (law and order) Arup Patnaik, exposing how blatantly child trafficking and child labour operate in the metropolis. 

 The raids were conducted with active help from the Task Force, an umbrella group of 46 NGOs of child welfare organisations like Bal Prafulta, Saathi and CCVC, among others. The social workers began the identification process of each child.

 The future course of action would be decided after all the necessary information is collected, said Patnaik, who admitted that child labour does not get adequate attention from the law enforcement agencies in comparison with trafficking and drug peddling.

 Defence hub tightens belt

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Bangalore, Dec. 29: A blanket of security has enveloped major scientific, nuclear and defence installations across the country a day after the Bangalore attack.

 The Centre has given instructions to tighten security at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Indian Military Academy (IMA), oil refineries in the Northeast and sensitive government buildings in Delhi and other major cities, Union home secretary V.K. Duggal said today.

 Security around IMA in Dehra Dun is being strengthened as it is considered a soft military target.

 In Bangalore, a spokesman said HAL had raised the level of security at all its units following alerts from central security agencies. Visitors are being frisked. Our gates are closed and barricades have been put up, he said.

 The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) provides security to the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel) and Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) offices and the HAL airport in Bangalore.

 Defence laboratories under the Defence Research and Development Organisation and autonomous units like the Aeronautical Development Agency have their own security personnel, who are being helped by armed policemen stationed there, sources said.

 The home ministry is still unwilling to say officially that yesterdays attack was carried out by a Pakistan-based terrorist group.

 No terrorist organisation has so far claimed responsibility. But we are not ruling out the possibility of a terrorist attack, Duggal said.

 We hope to get important clues from one of the survivors, a lab assistant, about the person who sprayed bullets?. He is not in a position to make a statement at present but by tomorrow or the day after we, perhaps, would be able to get the sketch of the terrorist involved, Duggal said.

 Central intelligence agencies havent decided between the Jaish-e-Mohammad and the Lashkar-e-Toiba. A source said the Jaish was the more likely suspect because of the small scale of the attack and its ham-handed execution.

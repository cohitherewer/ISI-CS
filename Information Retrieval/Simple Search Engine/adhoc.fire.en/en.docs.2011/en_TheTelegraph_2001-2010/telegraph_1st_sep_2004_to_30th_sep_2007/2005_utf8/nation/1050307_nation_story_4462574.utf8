 Congress fires from young gun shoulders

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, March 6: The Congress took three days to think up a strategy to fight the Jharkhand propaganda war. Prodded ? and sometimes taunted ? by allies, it finally decided to deploy its ?babalog?. 

 The dharna staged by Rahul Gandhi with other young Congress MPs in front of Parliament House on Thursday ? officially to protest against the repeated adjournments of the two Houses ? was part of this strategy.

 They were marshalled only after a senior non-Congress member taunted the party for doing nothing to put the BJP in the dock, United Progressive Alliance sources said. ?The BJP is getting away with disrupting the House... you have several, young, smart MPs, where are they?? he asked senior Congress members. 

 Two dozen MPs, including Sachin Pilot, Kuldeep Bishnoi, Jatin Prasada, Sandeep Dikshit, Ajay Maken, Madhu Gaur, Navin Jindal, Tejashwini, D. Purandareswari, had staged the sit-in outside Parliament. 

 ?We have come here to learn (from debates) but that is not being allowed,? Rahul had said and appealed to the Opposition not to ?disrupt and destroy the parliamentary process?.

 But the young guns were called to arms in such a hurry that at least one of them was not sure what the protest was all about. ?Are we protesting against the Jharkhand governor?? he was heard asking his stupefied colleagues.

 Some of the allies wondered why the Congress was not tapping the young talent at its disposal or whether the GeNext is unable to match the street-smartness of the BJP. 

 ?They look smart and profound, they may be good at talk shows on television, but politics has to be fought on the street also,? said a UPA member. 

 The UPA allies ? the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Left ? are miffed with the Congress for allowing the BJP to gain mileage after Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi invited Shibu Soren to form the government in Ranchi.

 The NDA got away with better coverage even after paralysing Parliament for four days last week while the Congress did nothing to counter it, said an RJD leader, concerned at the Jharkhand developments.

 ?First, the Congress failed to anticipate what the BJP could do. The Congress could have taken away the Independent MLAs before the saffron party. What was the Intelligence Bureau doing?? asked an RJD MP.

 A JMM member also criticised the Congress. ?The fact that the BJP abducted Independent MLAs to create artificial support was not highlighted in the media properly. The fact that the BJP, when it ruled the Centre, did the same thing (in the case of Bihar governor inviting Nitish Kumar to form a government without numbers in 2000) was not driven home properly,? he said. 

 The CPM and the CPI, though critical of the governor?s action, condemned the BJP bid to ?throttle democracy? by not allowing debates. 

 Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, on a few occasions, expressed his anguish at the method used by the BJP. On Friday, he was heard saying: ?This is a very sad day. I will not allow liquidation of democracy. I am compelled to adjourn the House. 

 ?There is no respect for the chair and Parliament. The leader of Opposition has sought recall of the two governors. As you know well, how can I do that??

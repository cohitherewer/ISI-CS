 Pak sets date to free fishermen

Islamabad (PTI): Pakistan will release 266 Indian fishermen 

currently in its custody on January 6 through the Wagah border point, officials 

said.

 It is rare that the fishermen, moved to Lahore on Sunday, are being released by road. Normally they are released along with their boats and permitted to set sail. Pakistan has informed the Indian high commission of its decision. The identification of the fishermen has been processed through consular access, Indian officials said here.

 Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Khokhar after his recent talks with his Indian counterpart Shyam Saran said that in future only the fishermen would be repatriated and their boats would be confiscated after provisions of consular access.

 An Indian delegation of the fishing community from Gujarat is currently in Karachi, negotiating with Pakistani authorities for the release of the seized boats.

 There are 966 Indian fishermen in Pakistans custody, while a little over 100 Pakistani fishermen are detained in prisons in Gujarat.

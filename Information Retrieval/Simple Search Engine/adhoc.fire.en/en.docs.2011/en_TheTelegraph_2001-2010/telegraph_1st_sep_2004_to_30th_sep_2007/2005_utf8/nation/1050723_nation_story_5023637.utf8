 Rane at Sonia door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 22: Narayan Rane is set to follow former colleague Sanjay Nirupam into the Congress.

 The expelled Shiv Sena leader has decided to join the Congress, said party leaders, including general secretary Margaret Alva, after he called on Congress chief Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath this evening.

 Congress sources said Rane would join the party after the Speaker recognises Ramdas Kadam as the Sena legislature party leader.

 Rane had conveyed to senior party leaders, including Alva and Union home minister Shivraj Patil, his preference for joining the Congress over Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party.

 But Rane, who had a dinner meeting with Pawar last night, gave the impression that he is keeping his options open. You people can draw your own inference about my future course of action after my meeting (with Sonia).

 Rane said 11 Sena MLAs were still loyal to him and claimed that several Sena MPs were also inclined to join hands with him.

 Modi baiters fire showcause salvo

 Ahmedabad/New Delhi (PTI): 

 Narendra Modi is facing fresh dissidence with several BJP 

 MLAs and 15 MPs from Gujarat demanding withdrawal of a showcause 

 notice to Govardhan Zadaphia for refusing to join the chief 

 minister?s cabinet.

 About 18 MLAs owing allegiance 

 to former chief minister Keshubhai Patel met state BJP president 

 Vajubhai Vala on Thursday and handed over a letter demanding 

 the withdrawal in larger interest of the party.

 In New Delhi, the MPs faxed a letter to Vala saying graver acts of indiscipline had taken place in other state units but nobody was show-caused.

 On August 1, Zadaphia refused to take oath during a swearing-in ceremony. When his name was called, Zadaphia folded his hands and said he was not interested in joining the cabinet. 

 The MLAs letter said just as the chief minister has the right to choose his ministers, MLAs have the right to refuse or accept a post, it said. 

 Defence surveillance system

 New Delhi (PTI): India will have a satellite-based 

 military surveillance and reconnaissance system in place 

 by 2007, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Lok 

 Sabha on Thursday.

 The project, a joint venture by the Indian Space Research Organisation and the Defence Research and Development Organisation, was to be operational by 2005 but validation of technologies had taken more time than anticipated.

 Experts said the extensive ground-based surveillance systems, hooked up to remote-sensing satellites, would help India keep a watch on all explosive spots, missile silos and movements in the neighbourhood as well as sudden military build-ups. 

 Pakistani spy 

 Jaipur (PTI): A Pakistani 

 national, living here for two years, has been arrested on 

 the charge of spying.

 Police have seized documents containing 

 sensitive information on defence installations 

 in Rajasthan from him. Shah Nawaz Khan, who lived in Calcutta 

 before migrating to Pakistan, has allegedly admitted to 

 being an ISI agent. 

 Marriage row 

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): A 

 couple?s refusal to let their son marry an underage girl, 

 with whom he had an affair, has angered a village council 

 in Uttar Pradesh. The panchayat, which wanted the young 

 man and woman to marry to avoid a scandal, fined the family 

 Rs 4,000 and expelled the youth from the village.

 Ayodhya victim

 Lucknow: Shanti Devi, a 

 40-year-old woman who was injured during the militant raid 

 on the disputed premises in Ayodhya, died on Wednesday. 

 She was in a coma for 30 days. 

 The cancellation of trains because of heavy rain in western India has affected pilgrim flow to Amarnath this year, with only 757 people visiting the cave shrine since the yatra began.

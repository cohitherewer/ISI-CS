 PM set for trip to Siachen

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 1: Manmohan Singh will arrive in Siachen on June 12, the first visit to the glacier by a Prime Minister.

 A ceasefire has held good in the glacier since November 2003. Last week the defence secretaries of India and Pakistan concluded the ninth round of talks aimed at de-militarising the area. No agreement was reached but both sides said progress was good and the talks would continue.

 The Prime Minister has been pushing for a pro-active approach to structure peace in Siachen. But Pakistan is understood to have conveyed in the defence secretary-level talks that Indias proposal for an authentication of the Actual Ground Position Line was not acceptable to it.

 India has consistently said that it can consider pulling back troops if the AGPL is authenticated, if not on maps, then by other means. But Islamabad wants a pullback without identifying the positions now held by the armies.

 Cabinet nod for fiscal bill

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 13: The Orissa cabinet today approved the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, paving the way for its introduction in the ongoing budget session of the Assembly.

 The cabinet could not give its approval in its last meeting due to the opposition of some senior leaders, including law minister Biswabhusan Harichandan.

 ?The Bill will enable the government to get central loans at a band rate of 7.5 per cent instead of the current rate of 9-13 per cent. We will thus save about Rs 600 crore annually,? finance minister Prafulla Ghadei said. 

 The bill will fix responsibility on the government to ensure proper financial management through progressive elimination of revenue deficit, reduction in fiscal deficit and greater transparency in fiscal operations. 

 According to the draft bill, state governments should be guided by the principles of transparency, stability and predictability, responsibility, fairness and efficiency for fiscal management. 

 During his recent visit to the state, senior World Bank economist V.J. Ravishankar advised the government to pay more attention to non-tax revenue, which has stagnated. 

 The Finance Commission has linked several relief measures to improvement in fiscal performance. It had recommended Rs 36,942.77 crore for the state for the period 2005-10, which constitutes 4.89 per cent of the total amount recommended for all states.

 Frisk-shy Speaker calls off trip 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 7: Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today cited ?my country?s prestige? to call off an official visit to Australia because he did not want to be frisked at the Sydney airport.

 Chatterjee was to attend a meeting of the committee of the Commonwealth Parliament Association as the head of the India charter.

 Sources in the Speaker?s office quoted Chatterjee as saying: ?My country?s prestige is at stake and I don?t want to compromise on it. I would prefer not to go.?

 Chatterjee ? expected to return here on April 11 after attending an Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting in Manila ? had conveyed to the foreign ministry that he would accept an invitation to attend the Sydney meeting only if he was not subject to security clearance, the sources said.

 His contention, they added, was: ?As Speaker of the Lok Sabha, which represents the world?s largest democracy, if I am not trusted in any of the countries, then I should not go there. We have to be exempted from security checks as heads of government and heads of state.?

 Chatterjee decided to call off his trip ? his first to Australia ? once Australian authorities communicated to their Indian counterparts that he would not be exempt from the mandated security checks.

 His view was that ?unless we (countries) respect each other, how can we have good relations??, sources said. The Speaker found it ?all the more painful when a fellow Commonwealth country does this?. 

 ?It is very unfortunate. It is really an affront to India that some country insists on rigorous checks on its Speaker in the name of security,? he was quoted as saying by sources.

 They added that the Speaker was not frisked when he visited the US in September, unlike some NDA leaders when they went as ministers.

 George Fernandes, then defence minister, was strip-searched twice in the US but made no noise about it. Not even his NDA colleagues Jaswant Singh and Yashwant Sinha, both former foreign ministers, were aware of this.

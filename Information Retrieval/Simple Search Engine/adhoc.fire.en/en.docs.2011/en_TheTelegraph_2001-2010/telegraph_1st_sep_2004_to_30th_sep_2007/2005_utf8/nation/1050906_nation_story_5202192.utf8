 BJP hits PC with stock stick 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: The BJP has found a new stick to beat the finance minister with.

 After demanding that P. Chidambaram quit because his wife appeared as a special counsel for an income-tax case for the revenue department, which reports to his ministry, the Opposition party is questioning the ministers lack of action against an erring Securities and Exchange Board of India director.

 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said Madhukar, a full-time Sebi member, had predicted that the sensex would skyrocket to 16,000 points within a year at a meet organised by the Bombay Stock Exchange on August 19 in Mumbai.

 He said despite complaints by investor associations and a letter from eight legislators of the BJP and the Shiv Sena, dated August 24, Chidambaram had neither expressed any opinion nor taken any action against the erring Sebi director. He demanded firm action against Madhukar.

 Asked why the BJP did not raise the matter when Parliament was in session, Javadekar said the party had wanted to give Chidambaram time to act on the letter. 

 We brought it up today because there is no word from the minister even after 10 days, he said.

 The BJP feels that millions of small investors could take Madhukars statement at face value. It is in violation of Sebi guidelines, corporate governance and also it is fraudulent and (involves) unfair trade practice under various Sebi regulations, Javadekar said.

 Section 12 A of the Sebi Act, 1992, states that no person shall engage in any act, practice, course of business that operates as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act.... 

 It stipulates a stiff money penalty in case of a violation.

 Section 15HA lists planting false or misleading news which may induce sale or purchase of securities as a manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practice.

 Javadekar said Sebi was mandated to regulate the market and not predict its movement. The director seems to have forgotten the sensitivity and responsibility of his role, he said. 

 Ironically, Sebi has issued several notices to market players against making such statements and has evolved guidelines for experts appearing on TV channels, Javadekar said, adding Chidambaram himself had cautioned about the sensex hitting the 8,000 mark.

 He cited a legal precedent in the UK where the financial regulator took action against two persons for issuing misleading and deceptive statements.

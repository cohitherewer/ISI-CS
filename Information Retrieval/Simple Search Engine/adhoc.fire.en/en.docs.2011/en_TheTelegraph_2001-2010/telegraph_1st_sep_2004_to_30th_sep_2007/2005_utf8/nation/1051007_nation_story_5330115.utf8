 Bhel balm with welfare poser

 - Congress chief sends Left leaders letter saying divestment is on hold

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karat: Letter lolly

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: After keeping the Left waiting for four months, the United Progressive Alliance regime today sent a letter saying the Centre has kept in abeyance the decision to divest shares in Bhel.

 The letter, signed by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, came with a request that the four Left parties begin attending the allies co-ordination committee meetings.

 However, sources said the Congress chief has asked the Left to come up with suggestions to find resources for meeting the social welfare commitments made in the common minimum programme. The government has been saying that the proceeds from the divestment were needed to fund welfare schemes.

 Sonias letter comes at a time when the Left is livid with the government for voting with Washington on Irans nuclear programme.

 The three-paragraph letter says: I am referring to your letter dated 26th June informing that the government should desist from Bhel disinvestment. 

 I have consequently received a letter from the Prime Minister informing of the government decision to keep Bhel disinvestment in abeyance. I hope this would allay your concern.

 In view of the government decision, I request you to resume participation in the UPA-Left co-ordination committee.

 Copies of the letter were individually addressed to Prakash Karat (CPM), A.B. Bardhan (CPI), Abani Roy (RSP) and Debabrata Biswas (Forward Bloc). Karat and Bardhan are expected to return to Delhi from Mumbai tomorrow.

 The four parties will come out with a response only after a Left Front meeting, but seem likely to resume attending the co-ordination committee sessions.

 Four months ago, the Left parties had announced they were suspending participation in the committee following the Centres move to divest 10 per cent of its shares in the navratna PSU. The Left decision had followed a series of deadlocked talks with the Prime Minister and the finance minister.

 The government then blinked first, signalling at various forums that it would keep the divestment on hold. But the Left refused to return to the co-ordination committee till the government sent an official letter.

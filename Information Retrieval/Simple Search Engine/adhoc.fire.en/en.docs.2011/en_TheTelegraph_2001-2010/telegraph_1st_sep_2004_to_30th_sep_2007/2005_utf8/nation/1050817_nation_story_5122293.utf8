The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 STAR News trumps rivals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: Its Bengali sibling had recently triumphed over competition in Bengal. Now, STAR News has managed to emerge as number one among all news channels in the Hindi speaking markets.

 According to viewership data from Television Audience Measurement (TAM), the channel garnered 25 per cent average market share during the period July 31-August 6. 

 The top four programmes were also on STAR News, with STAR Savera leading the pack.

 Our performance in the 16 Hindi-speaking markets clearly shows that we are fast becoming the preferred channel of the people, particularly when other channels are losing market share, said Uday Shankar, CEO of Media Content amp; Communications Services India (MCCS), which manages STAR News and STAR Ananda.

 STAR News beat close rival Aaj Tak in all the four metros with 28 per cent market share (Aaj Tak had 25 per cent). 

 The highest amount of average time spent (54 minutes) also points towards high viewer loyalty towards the channel, Shankar pointed out.

 What seems to have worked for the channel is its sharply people-focused programmes. 

 We dont have an agenda and our reporting seems to answer all the questions that people have, Shankar said. 

 But the battle for the number one slot is clearly far from over. 

 Theres a lot of turmoil in the Hindi market, but these results send out the right signals. We will work on all the areas to consolidate our position, Shankar added.

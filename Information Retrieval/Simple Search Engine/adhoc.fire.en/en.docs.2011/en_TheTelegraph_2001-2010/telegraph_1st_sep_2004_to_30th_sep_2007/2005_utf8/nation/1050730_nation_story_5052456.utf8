 Srinagar, July 29: Furious at her husband, Kafur Jan walked out of home and across the Line of Control, reports our correspondent.

 A resident of a village in Bagh district in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Kafur realised her mistake when she was caught by Indian troops in Uri in Baramulla district.

 She told the Border Security Force personnel that she had no malicious intentions and had run away from home after husband Yaqub Mir thrashed her.

 The BSFs 109 battalion then handed Kafur over to police, who are exploring the legalities of taking her back to her parents in Balian Wali Dhok village in Bagh district.

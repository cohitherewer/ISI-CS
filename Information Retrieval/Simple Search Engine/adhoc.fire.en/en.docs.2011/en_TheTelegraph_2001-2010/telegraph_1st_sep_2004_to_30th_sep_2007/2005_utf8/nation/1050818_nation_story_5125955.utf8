 Ban back on Maoists in Andhra

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Aug. 17: Andhra Pradesh today ended an uneasy truce with the Maoists, re-clamping a ban on their activities after holding out an olive branch for over a year.

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy signed the order outlawing the CPI(Maoists) and seven sister organisations two days after a senior Congress legislator, his son and seven others were gunned down.

 Announcing the re-imposition of prohibitory orders under the 1992 Andhra Pradesh Public Security Act, state home minister K. Jana Reddy said the government had tried its best to reason with the guerrillas to give up arms and join the mainstream but its efforts had come a cropper.

 Mondays incident wherein the veteran Congress legislator C. Narsi Reddy was assassinated along with eight others was the last straw in public patience and drove us to revive the ban on them, he said.

 For the first time, the state came down on the Revolutionary Writers Association and banned it. P. Varavara Rao and G. Kalyan Rao, Maoist spokesmen in the peace talks, were founder members of the RWA.

 The home minister said there were no plans to ban any more guerrilla outfits though over 12 operated in the state.

 Apart from the RWA, the other banned outfits include Radical Youth League, Radical Students Union, Singareni Karmika Sangham, Rytu Coolie Sangham, All India Revolutionary Students Federation and Viplava Karmika Sangham.

 Earlier, chief minister Reddy spoke with Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who said Andhra was experimenting with peace at the cost of innocent lives.

 You have tried it for almost a year. Now is the time for you to co-ordinate efforts and policies with other states facing the same problem, Patil said. The home minister said the Maoists had taken advantage of the lifting of the ban since July last year and resorted to killing innocent people, extortion and stockpiling arms.

 The government has a duty to maintain law and order and we can not keep our eyes closed for ever, he said.

 Civil rights groups have, however, condemned the ban. Rajasekhar Reddy has gone back on his promise to resolve the issue through dialogue. By re-imposing the ban, he has proved he is not different from fascist Chandrababu Naidu, poet-activist Gaddar said.

 In an article in a local daily, Maoist spokesman Varavara Rao wrote: Why dont the media and political parties condemn when police kill civil rights activists or Maoists? How can the right-minded just blame one side?

 VHP invites Cong 

leader to sting BJP

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 22: Even in his wildest dreams, Congress leader Arjun Modhvadia might not have expected an invite from the VHP.

 In a bid to snub the BJP ? the estranged member of the Sangh parivar ? the VHP has broken from tradition and invited the Opposition leader to a religious function, which it organises with great fanfare in Rajkot every year. 

 It is, however, not clear whether the Congress leader, who is now in the US, will attend the Janmashtami Shobha Yatra to be held on Saturday.

 Around 10,000 people participate in the yatra ? being organised since 1986 to mark the birth of Lord Krishna ? where more than 150 tableaux are displayed. Until last year, the procession was also used as an effective platform to promote Hindutva.

 In 2003, Godhra MLA and former VHP leader Haresh Bhatt was a special guest at the event which had a tableaux depicting the burning Sabarmati Express. 

 However, with BJP president L.K. Advani lavishing praise on Jinnah during his visit to Pakistan, the colours of the festival have undergone a sea change, although the VHP and BJP are loathe to admit it.

 Convener of the yatra, Chaman Sindhav, brushed aside the invitation to Modhvadia, saying it is nothing special and that he was chosen because he is a Hindu and not because he is from the Congress. 

 However, the fact remains that this is the first time a state-level Congress leader has been asked to participate in the festival.

 The BJP city president, Dhanshukh Dhaneri, said he was not aware why the VHP had invited Modhvadia this year. 

 But, he hastened to add, there is proper co-ordination between the VHP and BJP for the preparation of the yatra.

 Reports from Rajkot belie the BJP leaders claim, though. The tussle at the top ? VHP firebrand leader Pravin Togadia has virtually declared a war on Advani and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi ? has had a definite fallout on the yatra, say residents.

 So much so that VHP activists ? most owing allegiance Modis friend-turned-foe Togadia ? are not letting BJP workers decorate the streets in many areas of the city.

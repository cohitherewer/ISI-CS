New Delhi, March 17: The BJP today went to 

battle in Parliament over the bus-service peace move, prompting a spirited defence 

from Manmohan Singh while his foreign minister exchanged words with a rival.

 The main Opposition party claimed that dispensing with passports for the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service would weaken Delhi?s traditional position that Kashmir is an integral part of India and dilute its claim to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 The BJP, whose ruling alliance under Atal Bihari Vajpayee had initiated the move, believed India was playing into Pakistan?s hands by allowing travel permit instead of visa and passport.

 The party further felt that the Congress-led government was making it easier for people with dubious antecedents to enter the country, thus endangering national security.

 ?I can assure you that all agencies concerned with security in the country were consulted before the decision to allow permits was taken. All of them agreed that there was no threat to our nation?s security,? Prime Minister Singh said in the Rajya Sabha.

 Former foreign minister Jaswant Singh wanted to know what India had gained diplomatically from the bus decision. The Prime Minister said ?we are sincerely dealing with the human problem of divided families and hope to make access easier for them?.

 He fended off Yashwant Sinha?s claim that dispensing with passports would signal that normal Indian travel documents did not hold good for Kashmir.

 Pakistan says Kashmir is a ?disputed? territory and held by Delhi through military might. 

 ?I am satisfied that the particular document (special entry permit) that is being used for this purpose does not in any way compromise our rights and obligations with regard to the state of Jammu and Kashmir,? Manmohan Singh said.

 But before the Prime Minister stepped in, K. Natwar Singh took a swipe at Sinha when he wanted to know the authority in Pakistan designated for the permit system.

 ?This is an extraordinary situation where we have to answer for Pakistan,? the foreign minister said.

 ?I am amazed and disappointed,? Sinha responded.

 ?I return the compliment,? Natwar Singh said. ?I am also amazed and disappointed.?

 Jaswant Singh stepped in to ask why the government had decided to move away from the passport regime. Earlier, junior foreign minister E. Ahmed had gone through the details of the permit regime.

 Natwar Singh told Jaswant that ?I don?t have your style with words...People in Kashmir have welcomed the move and that is important...not what you or I think?.

 The fireworks in the Upper House, which was adjourned for over half-an-hour, started when Rajnath Singh said the Centre should have made a statement in Parliament about the bus service, scheduled to start on April 7.

 Natwar Singh said he had done so earlier. He added that the UPA government acknowledged that the bus talks were part of the Vajpayee-Musharraf engagement and that his government was taking forward what the NDA had started.

 A Congress spokesperson in the party?s routine briefing in the evening said permits had been allowed because travellers would be crossing the Line of Control between the two Kashmirs and not the international border.

 Passport would have been the only document acceptable to the government if the travel was across the international border with Pakistan, the spokesperson added.

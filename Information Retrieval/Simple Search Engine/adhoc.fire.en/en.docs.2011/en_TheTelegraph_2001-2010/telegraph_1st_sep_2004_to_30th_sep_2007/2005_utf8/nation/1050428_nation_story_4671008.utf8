 Mulayam sniffs phone-tapping

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 27: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has alleged that the Centre is tapping his phones.

 Addressing a programme on Muslim education here, he said: ?My phones, party general secretary Amar Singh?s and my brother Seopal Singh Yadav?s (a state minister) as well are being bugged.?

 Mulayam had levelled the same allegation four years ago against the then National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre.

 ?They (UPA ministers) want to keep a tab on me and my party workers. But this is undemocratic,? he said today. ?Perhaps they want to know more thoroughly about my plans in future,? Mulayam added, insinuating that his conversations are being monitored because he has been talking about a third front.

 The Samajwadi Party leader, who has been trying to wean away the Left from the United Progressive Alliance, claimed that he had authentic information on who had ordered the ?tapping?. Asked to reveal the identity, he said: ?It is too obvious to tell you.?

 Six months ago, Amar Singh had alleged here that Mulayam?s phones were being tapped. ?A conspiracy is on to implicate him in an old arms deal case,? he had said. Mulayam was defence minister in the H.D. Deve Gowda government at the Centre.

 Union minister of state for home Sri Prakash Jaiswal denied the allegations today and said: ?He (Mulayam Singh Yadav) wanted to get some publicity out of this.?

 In April 2001, Mulayam, who was not in power then, had set off a wave of angry reactions when he alleged that his phone was being tapped. Then, too, he had claimed authentic information and said he knew which Union minister had issued the order. He had threatened to divulge the name, but had not done so. Asked for the name today, he said: ?I will disclose the name at an appropriate time.?

 Sources said the latest phone-tapping charge is an attempt by Mulayam to mount pressure on the UPA government and earn the Left?s sympathy.

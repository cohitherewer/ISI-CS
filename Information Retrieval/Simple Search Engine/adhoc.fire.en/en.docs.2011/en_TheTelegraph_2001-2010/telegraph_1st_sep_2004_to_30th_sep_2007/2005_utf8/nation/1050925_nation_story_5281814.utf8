 Riot note buck in Centre court

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 24: Rashtrapati Bhavan has told a panel probing the Gujarat riots that it had consulted the Centre before refusing to hand over letters written by former President K.R. Narayanan to then Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee on grounds of privilege.

 The Presidents secretariat, which had twice refused the documents, today asked for two more weeks to respond to the Nanavati-Shah Commissions request. On September 6, the panel had rejected the claim of privilege and asked for the letters written during the 2002 riots to be submitted by today. 

 The secretariat said this order has been brought to the notice of the Union government for its advice. Adding that it had found it impossible to meet the deadline despite its best efforts, Rashtrapati Bhavan sought extra time. 

 Mukul Sinha, the riot victims counsel who had prodded the commission to ask for the papers, said he was surprised at the Centre. 

 The letters were written by Narayanan to Vajpayee between February 28, 2002 and March 31, 2002, advising him on how to tackle the violence. Narayanan told a magazine a few months ago that Vajpayee had ignored his letters that urged immediate deployment of the army and granting the forces the right to shoot.

 In view of the high position of the President, the commission requested Rashtrapati Bhavan to produce the documents instead of issuing a directive. It noted that the letters were relevant to its probe.

 Sinha, who represents the rights group Jan Sangharsh Manch fighting for the riot victims, today said the UPA government does not appear interested in finding out the truth about the riots or it would have not advised the President to refuse the papers.

 Banerjee probe

 The commission today instructed the U.C. Banerjee Committee probing the Godhra train burning to submit copies of all relevant records on the train burning in 15 days.

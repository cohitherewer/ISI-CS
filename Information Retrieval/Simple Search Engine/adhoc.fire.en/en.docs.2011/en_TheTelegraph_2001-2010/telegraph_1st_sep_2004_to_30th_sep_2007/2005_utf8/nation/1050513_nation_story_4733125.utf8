New Delhi, May 12: The Centre has decided to set up a wildlife crime control bureau, along the lines of the narcotics control bureau, to check poaching and illegal trading of animals, animal skins and other forest and animal products, especially from protected areas, the Supreme Court was informed today.

 The apex court, in turn, directed the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe the seizure of several leopard skins by Delhi police on April 6, find out about the persons behind the illegal trade and file a report before it by July.

 Solicitor general G.E. Vahanvati told a bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and Y.K. Sabharwal that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as head of the National Board for Wildlife has decided to set up the wildlife crime bureau.

 The ministry of environment and forests has taken proactive steps to stop poaching and a proposal for creating a wildlife crime bureau had already been approved by the National Board for Wildlife headed by the Prime Minister, Vahanvati told the court.

 The affidavit by the environment and forest ministry said the bureau would act as a multi-agency unit with full-time officers from the forest and wildlife departments, various paramilitary forces, police, the directorate of revenue intelligence, Intelligence Bureau, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Force and customs.

 The body would also work towards developing a national-level policy for containing illegal trade in animal products and investigate wildlife crimes in a professional manner, the affidavit said.

 The proposed bureau will have its headquarters at New Delhi and nine regional offices shall require creation of 260 new posts at various levels to ensure its operational efficacy and meet the objectives set, the ministry said. Funds for the bureau would be made available from the allocation for the tenth Five Year Plan, it said.

 Rain-wary Mumbai rushes relief

 Mumbai, Sept. 10: Heavy rain lashed the city for the second consecutive day but authorities, wary of a repeat of Julys devastating floods, moved fast to evacuate about 500 families from low-lying areas.

 The downpour claimed two lives but unlike yesterday, Mumbais transport systems remained largely unaffected. Central Railway stopped services briefly, but Western Railway and the harbour line functioned smoothly. The airport, too, was not affected.

 Overnight rain submerged low-lying areas in the central and western suburbs, flooding homes in Sion, Kalina, Kurla, Bhandup, Andheri, Bandra, Goregaon, Jogeshwari and Dahisar. Civic authorities pumped out water from affected areas and rescue teams remained at the ready in case of more bad weather and flooding.

 Now the water has been drained out (of the affected areas), the states top relief official, Krishna S. Vatsa, told Reuters. We have a warning for heavy showers in certain pockets. We are very much on standby.

 Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said the city received 200 mm of rainfall overnight. We have been monitoring the situation, and conducted evacuation exercises wherever necessary.

 Deshmukh said the civic authorities had worked out a plan to provide information on electronic billboards at major roads and rail junctions to warn residents and give them an idea about areas affected and the status of transport systems.

 In Pune, Met department sources said rainfall in the June-September season this year has erased a nearly 100-year-old record.

 Rainfall from June 1 this year has been recorded at 1000.2 mm, higher the 1907 record of 994.1 mm, the sources said. By the time the monsoon ends on September 30, the figure should swell by a few more millimetres, they said.

 The sources said they expected widespread rainfall over Maharashtra in the next few days but the downpour would not be very heavy except at isolated places.

 Pune deputy municipal commissioner Laxman Damse said there has been no flooding in any part of the city despite heavy rainfall in the past three days.

 In Mumbai, officials said rescuers had found the body of a woman buried in a mudslide in a rundown suburb. But conditions were nowhere near as bad as those in late July, when floods and mudslides killed more than 1,000 people in the region.

 The teeming city of more than 15 million people was brought to a standstill for four days in late July and early August when more than 900 mm of rain fell in 24 hours, flooding entire suburbs.

 Several old buildings collapsed last month after being weakened by the rain, killing over a dozen people.

 Cops rapped in Salem case 

 Mumbai, Dec. 8 (PTI): Designated anti-terror court judge P.V. Bavkar, who remanded Abu Salem in the anti-terrorist squads custody till December 17, was annoyed today as the squad failed to inform him about another courts order to produce the gangster before it.

 There is no problem with taking him to another court, but you should have sought this courts permission first, he said, adding that the public prosecutor will have to explain this omission tomorrow morning in his court.

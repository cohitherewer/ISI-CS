 Deadline passes but Uma mum

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: The BJP, having all but decided to sack Uma Bharti, is trying hard to play down the issue to keep the spotlight on the Volcker controversy. But the firebrand sadhvi is not so easily dismissed.

 The three days that Uma was given to reply to her expulsion notice lapsed today without any word from her.

 While the BJP did not react formally, general secretary in charge of Madhya Pradesh Arun Jaitley said the leadership had decided against calling a parliamentary board meeting and left it to L.K. Advani to settle her fate. The party president is fully authorised to take the decision, Jaitley said.

 The buzz in party circles is that the decision ? which is expected to go against Uma ? will be taken quietly within a couple of days and conveyed to her without fanfare. After the way she has been behaving, is there anything left to say? The Uma story is over, a senior party leader said.

 The BJP does not want to do anything that will take the focus away from the Volcker controversy that has erupted again on the Congress, with former foreign minister Natwar Singh being accused of involvement in the Iraqi oil-for-food scam by a former prot?g?. 

 But the sadhvi has other plans. She will make sure everyone gets to hear of her plight, sources said. Uma, who observed a maun vrat (vow of silence) today and locked herself up in a room till afternoon, is likely to address a public meeting tomorrow. She has already accused the party of discriminating against her on account of caste, class and gender.

 Expected to play the victim and hit out at the party at tomorrows rally, Uma will make sure that if she has to go, she will go with a bang.

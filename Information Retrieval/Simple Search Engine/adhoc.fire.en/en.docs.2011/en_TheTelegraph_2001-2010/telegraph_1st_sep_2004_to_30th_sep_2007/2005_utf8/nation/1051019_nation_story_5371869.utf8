 Guns silent in Red belt

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna/Jehanabad, Oct. 18: The Naxalite hotbed of central and south Bihar voted in the first round of Assembly elections today, free of rebel violence.

 Authorities reported just one death ? of a trouble-maker in police firing ? from the 57 constituencies that voted in the presence of over 90,000 securitymen. The turnout was between 43 and 46 per cent. 

 Four candidates ? three of them from the Rashtriya Janata Dal and one Independent ? were arrested for election-related offences.

 The RJD nominee from Gobindpur, Sanjay Prabhat, was arrested because he broke electronic voting machines. In Deo, Suresh Paswan was taken into custody as he and his men were moving with rifles, chief secretary G.S. Kang said. 

 Its Jamui candidate, Vijay Prakash, the brother of Union minister Jai Prakash Yadav, was arrested. In Dehri, Independent candidate Pradeep Joshi was taken into custody.

 Seventy per cent of the booths were fully manned by central paramilitary forces, which, unlike in earlier elections, did not patrol the roads. In the coming phases, we intend to increase this coverage, Kang said. At most, we expect a repoll in 20 booths due to technical reasons.

 Director-general of police A.R. Sinha said: In February, these areas recorded 185 incidents of violence and 24 deaths. This time, we have only five incidents and one death so far.

 The change was quite visible at three randomly selected booths in Masaurhi, Jehanabad and Makhdumpur, all Naxalite strongholds and notorious for election violence.

 The Lodipur booth in Jehanabad was guarded by CRPF personnel, who did not allow any voter in without specific identification. I am witnessing no-tension polling for the first time in my long career with the government, said polling magistrate Nand Kishore.

 The BSF guarded the booth at Makhpa village of Makhdumpur and some stood on the roof of a school building with guns. An RJD supporter, however, said the turnout was lower than that in February.

 Rajdev Yadav at the Sahwagpur village booth of Jehanabad was happy as no one was being prevented from voting unlike earlier times.

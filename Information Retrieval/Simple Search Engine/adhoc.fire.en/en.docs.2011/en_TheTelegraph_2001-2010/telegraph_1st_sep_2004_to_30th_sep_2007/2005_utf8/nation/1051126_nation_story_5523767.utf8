 Showpiece copter crashes

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: Indias showpiece Dhruv helicopter recorded a first crash today, immediately casting a shadow on efforts to export it for which the air force is sending a display team to Malaysia. 

 An indigenously-made Advanced Light Helicopter, the Dhruv, that crashed near Karimnagar in Andhra Pradesh this morning belonged to its maker, Bangalore-based public sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).

 The helicopter was flying from Bangalore to Ranchi. It crash-landed about 140 km northeast of Hakimpet Air Force base near Hyderabad after refuelling around 9 am. Apart from the two pilots, the helicopter was carrying four technicians. 

 Air force sources here said the crew and passengers were safe. Doctors had flown to the site of the crash at Paddapalli village from Hakimpet.

 The cause of the crash is not known. A board of inquiry has been constituted. Two possible reasons cited were loss of control by the pilots or an external factor. It was flying over a region that is known for Naxalite activity. During the elections in Andhra Pradesh last year, Naxalites had fired at two Indian Air Force helicopters that were flying low. The damage was inconsequential but the danger was established.

 Sources in the defence ministry in New Delhi said the twin-engine 5.5 tonne helicopter came down on soft ground and toppled over. It was a miraculous escape for the crew and passengers. On the positive side for HAL, the Dhruv has now also proved its crash-worthiness. 

 It is possible that the team from HAL was flying the helicopter to Ranchi to deliver it to the Jharkhand government. The Jharkhand government has booked two of the helicopters for policing and for VIP movement. The copter was to stop over at Raipur before landing in Ranchi. 

 Last year, a Dhruv helicopter used by the Royal Nepal Army also had a hard-landing. That led to political problems with some in the Nepalese establishment insinuating that India was palming off second-grade equipment. The copter was taken to HAL for repairs and has since been returned to the RNA.

 Apart from the export to Nepal, India is making efforts to sell the Dhruv to Latin American (Chile) and Southeast Asian countries. It was showcased at the Dubai airshow earlier this week. 

 The Sarang team ? a formation of ace Dhruv fliers of the IAF ? that performs breathtaking manoeuvres with the helicopter is slated to leave for the Langkawi International Maritime Aerospace 2005 airshow in Malaysia. They will also perform in Indonesia.

 But Fridays crash and the unanswered questions demand of the HAL that it clarify whether the chopper came down because of a technical glitch or for some other reason. Customers of high-value items like the Dhruv ? which is being exported with Israeli help ? are exacting and the Karimnagar crash will mean that HAL has a lot of explaining to do.

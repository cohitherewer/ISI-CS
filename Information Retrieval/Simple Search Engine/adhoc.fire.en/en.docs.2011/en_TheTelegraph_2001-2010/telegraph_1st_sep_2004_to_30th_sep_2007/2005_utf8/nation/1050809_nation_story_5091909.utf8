 Bigger bench to look at Bihar House mess

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The 

 Bihar Assembly dissolution case and the subsequent cloud 

 on fresh elections till the dissolution issue itself is 

 settled by the Supreme Court was today referred to a Constitution 

 bench.

 A three-judge bench of Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti, Justices C.K. Thakker and P.K. Balasubramanyan said if the larger bench could not be formed by September, the applications seeking to stay the Election Commission from issuing fresh notification for elections would be considered for final orders.

 This has put a cloud over fresh elections to the Assembly. At stake are the powers of the governor to recommend dissolution of the Assembly and the judiciarys jurisdiction to issue notice to the governor despite there being a constitutional bar on questioning actions taken by governors regarding their discharge of duties.

 The case is likely to set a precedent as, if the elections are stayed, it would be the first time in the countrys history that the electoral process is stopped by a court notice. 

 It would also be the first time that a dissolved Assembly is revived, if the court passes orders to that effect. Besides, if Bihar governor Buta Singh is asked to explain his action of recommending dissolution of the Assembly, it would be the first such instance in the country.

 There are six petitions challenging the dissolution. Four of these are in one group. They have been filed by National Democratic Alliance members of the dissolved Assembly, including a breakaway Lok Janashakti Party MLA. One petition has been filed by an Independent legislator of the Assembly, Poornima Yadav, and another is in the form of a public interest litigation by Supreme Court advocate Viplav Sharma.

 The advocate and the Independent legislator ? unlike the four NDA MLAs ? sought stalling of elections till the petition challenging the dissolution is decided. Sharma goes a step further and also wants a notice issued to the governor for his omissions and commissions.

 The court had earlier issued a notice to governor Buta Singh but had withdrawn it on being told that there is a constitutional bar. However, it kept open the question of issuing notices to governors by allowing Sharma to file a separate application impleading Buta as a respondent.

 During todays proceedings, all the counsel agreed that a larger bench should decide the issue. Milon Banerjee even said he ? in his capacity as the attorney-general and for the Union of India ? would demand a larger bench of nine or even 11 judges.

 The Supreme Court then said a Constitution bench would be formed tentatively on September 6 to decide all the issues.

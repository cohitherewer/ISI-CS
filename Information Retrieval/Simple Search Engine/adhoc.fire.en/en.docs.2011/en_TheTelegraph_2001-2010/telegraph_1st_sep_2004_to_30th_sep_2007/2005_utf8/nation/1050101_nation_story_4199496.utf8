The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Fax takes wind out of Sibal?s sails

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Dec. 31: Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal had yesterday distanced himself from the home ministry?s alert that unleashed a panic wave. 

 He had contended that the IMD had merely forwarded a warning received from a US-based firm that should not have been acted upon.

 A document accessed by The Telegraph, however, suggests that Sibal may not have been briefed properly before he held a media conference where he ran down the home ministry?s alert and the prediction. 

 The document, a fax from the IMD to the Union home ministry?s disaster management division control room, suggests the home ministry only followed the advice of the science and technology ministry.

 Home ministry officials said they received the first intimation about the Australian Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre?s alert a little past 9 last morning from the IMD and asked for the report to be sent in writing so that action could be taken.

 The written intimation came by fax at 9.50 am. It was sent by the director (seismology) R.S. Dattatrayam. 

 ?In continuation to the telephonic conversation, it is to be informed that the following message has been received from the director, Met Centre, Bangalore, at 0910 hours IST today,? the communication said.

 ?Mr Manikyam of Isro has received an e-mail message from his Washington office that the Australian Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has issued a warning that tsunami is expected by afternoon in the Indian context,? the fax message said.

 The message predicted earthquakes of the intensity of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale in the Australian region, adding that the ?largest earthquake that was recorded in the Andaman amp; Nicobar Islands region since 0243 IST of 30 December 2004 has a magnitude of 5.8?.

 Home ministry officials said they could not have ignored the warning forwarded by a scientific department of the government, especially when the Australian region was still unstable.

 Contrary to Sibal?s claim that the home ministry had not been asked to act on the report but it was sent was only for information, the fax message had a line saying ?for necessary follow-up action?.

 The Andaman and Nicobar region has witnessed around 75 aftershocks since the December 26 earthquake, six of them since last evening.

 ?The department deals with science and if it does not feel that the warning is serious enough, it should have chucked the prediction into the dustbin. Why send it to us and ask us to take follow-up action,? a home ministry official asked, suggesting that the IMD had ?played safe?.

 If the IMD did so, so did home ministry officials.

 ?Once they sent us the warning, had we not done anything and an earthquake and a tsunami wave occurred, they would have contended that they passed on the information and we kept sitting on it,? another home ministry official said.

 Questions are also being raised in North Block why the IMD did not respond to the request through the day for an independent assessment of the prediction.

 ?We had sent in a written request seeking their opinion as soon as they sent us the report for follow-up action,? the official said.

 A hand-written note from the IMD did come but well past 6.30 pm ? the forecast of the earthquake was valid till 6 pm. Even in this note, officials said, the IMD did not reject the forecast. 

 It said that as an earthquake had not taken place as predicted, the alert could be scaled down.

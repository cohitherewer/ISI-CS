 Ekta in nudity soup gets actor cover

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ekta Kapoor: Harmless fun? 

 Mumbai, Sept. 27: The Kahiin Toh Hoga cast and crew members whom Ekta Kapoor had dared to bare are surprised she has been accused of encouraging nudity.

 A day after trade magazine editor Kumar Mohan filed an application urging police to take action against Ekta for asking invitees to turn up in minimum clothes at a theme party, some actors in the TV serial hit out at the middle-class stink in the allegation.

 I know Ekta Kapoor well enough to say she will not do anything unscrupulous, said Deepak Parasher, an actor in the Kahiin Toh Hoga unit.

 To celebrate the 200th episode, we decided to have a little bit of fun by giving a theme to the party. Ekta always organises theme parties to make them lively and fun-filled. Obviously, no one would turn up nude, but we were expecting beachwear.

 Turning up in a jacket and shorts, Parasher won the award for the least dressed person. Most of those who turned up were wearing normal party wear. A few of us did experiment.

 This complaint stinks of middle-class attitude towards such parties. It was nothing more than harmless fun, he said.

 Among the women who experimented with their clothes were Rucha Gujarati, Teejay Sidhu and Mita Vashisht, who turned up in backless dresses. Of the men, Gaurav Gera, Nikhil Arya and Manish Raisinghania were adventurous. Raisinghania wore shorts and a rope around his bare chest.

 Gaurav Gera, who plays Nandu in Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin, was stunned at the complaint. I was there, wearing pyjamas and T-shirt and there was nothing indecent about the party.

 I have seen more nudity in pubs and discotheques. There were no swimming costumes either. I was at the party till 4 am, and it didnt lead to anything indecent either. I dont think anybody should make such a big issue out of it.

 Despite repeated calls, Ekta was not available for comment.

 Mohans lawyer Nagesh Mishra said that if Ekta, a well-known TV producer, could do such a thing, anybody could do it.

 By organising such a party, she is trying to encourage nudity. The party was well covered by TV channels and my client was offended by the obscenity in it, he said.

 If such a respected producer can do this, any producer can organise a nude party tomorrow to increase the TRP rating of his or her serial.

 The police confirmed they had received the complaint. If police do not proceed in this case, we will approach the courts directly for suo motu action, Mishra said.

 SC plainspeak on Raj Bhavan 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: The Supreme Court has said Raj Bhavans have become extensions of party offices, heightening the suspense over the fate of the Bihar elections and reviving a debate whether the country needs to preserve the post of governors.

 One is CM (chief minister) today and tomorrow he is a governor. He is not a machine to switch off and on. His political leaning cannot be changed overnight. Raj Bhavans have become extensions of party offices, Justice Arijit Passayat said today.

 Justice Passayat is one of the five judges of the Constitution bench hearing the Bihar Assembly dissolution case in which governor Buta Singh has been accused of recommending dissolution of the hung Assembly in haste before the MLAs were sworn in.

 The judges sharp comments came as the Centre, through attorney-general Milon Banerjee and solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati and additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanian, defended Buta Singhs recommendation to dissolve the Assembly.

 The outcome of the case will have a bearing on fresh Bihar elections scheduled for next month. The petition against fresh elections was filed by a group of four NDA legislators of the dissolved Assembly.

 The Centre today sought to clear the mystery over the governor attaching a clipping of a news report of a May 22 newspaper along with his report of May 21.

 Additional solicitor-general Subramanian, who was asked by the court to examine the time and date of the report, informed the bench that it was prepared on May 21 and the clipping was attached on May 22 before it was sent to the home ministry.

 He said the governors report was sent to the President in Moscow (A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was on a foreign tour then) by fax at 01.52 am (May 23) local time. India is two hours ahead of Russia, Subramanian said. The return fax was received at 03.15 am local time.

 The petitioners have cited the flurry of action in the middle of the night to underscore their contention that the House was dissolved in undue haste to deny the NDA a chance to form the government and prove its majority.

 The arguments will continue on Tuesday.

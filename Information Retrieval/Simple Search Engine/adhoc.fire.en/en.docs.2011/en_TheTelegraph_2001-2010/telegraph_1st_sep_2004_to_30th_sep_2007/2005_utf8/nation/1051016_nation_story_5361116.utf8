 Assam curfew after ethnic clash

 Diphu: A dusk-to-dawn curfew has been imposed in the Diphu police station area of Karbi Anglong district in Assam on Saturday after fresh violence erupted with more than 120 houses of warring Dimasa and Karbi ethnic groups being burnt down.

 District administration sources said the curfew would remain in force till further orders.

 Earlier in the day, the houses were burnt down but there was no casualty as the villages were either abandoned or had a few men who fled as soon as the assailants arrived, police said.

 The situation in the ethnic-strife-hit district was stated to be tense and the army, police and paramilitary forces were patrolling the vulnerable areas.

 A joint meeting of the major Dimasa and Kachari organisation in Guwahati condemned the violence that has claimed 31 lives of both tribes since September 26.

 Human rights push in Valley

 GAUTAM DATT

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Union home ministry today set up a three-member panel to draw up standard operational procedures for security forces engaged in anti-militancy operations.

 This follows an assurance by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Hurriyat leaders in September that the Centre would take steps to improve the human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

 Army and paramilitary forces are often accused of rights violations in the border state. 

 The panel will include the director-general of military operations and directors- general of the Border Security Force and the Central Reserve Police Force.

 A sensitisation drive for security personnel is also on the cards. A charter of dos and donts is being prepared that will be circulated among soldiers manning the streets and all others who come in direct contact with civilians.

 The decisions were taken at a review meeting convened by Union home secretary V.K Duggal here. 

 The meeting was attended by the director-general of military operations and the chiefs of the CRPF, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Central Industrial Security Force and the state police.

 Procedures will be laid down for cordon-and-search operations at night and situations when curfew has to be imposed. 

 The troops will be oriented to be people-friendly so that they can carry out their duties without inconveniencing civilians.

 The brief for the panel is to keep the standard procedures simple so that they can be easily followed by the troops.

 Stress is being laid on transparency in human rights violation cases. It was decided that the cases should be settled within 90 days of a complaint. 

 The heads of paramilitary forces informed the home ministry that complaints of rights violations in the state have dropped in recent months. According to figures they submitted, since 1990, 215 personnel have been penalised for excesses. 

 The security forces also want to publicise the steps taken to curb violations as the general impression is that no action is ever taken.

 Turf war tells on expat meet

 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, March 6: A turf war between the external affairs ministry and the newly-created ministry for non-resident Indians has prevented India from participating in a global conference on international migration in Cape Town.

 With a large labour force, which seeks its fortune beyond the country?s shores, India is a huge player in the global labour market. This section of poor and semi-literate Indians are the ones who send back the largest remittances to India. 

 So far in 2004-2005, this group has sent in as much as $14,494 million and the figure by April is poised to reach $20,000 million, according to officials. 

 After the Philippines, the largest number of migrations are from India ? around 4.7 lakh is the official figure for 2004. Although this figure is deceptive as hundreds do not register, India has missed out on a conference that aims to provide an international framework to thrash out a ?coherent, comprehensive and global response to international migration?.

 The Global Commission on Migration was launched by UN secretary-general Kofi Annan in December 2003 in Geneva to look into the problems of migration and to place this on the global agenda by promoting a comprehensive debate on all aspects of migration among governments, international organisations, academia, civil society and private sector companies.

 By refusing to attend the conference in Cape Town from February 28 to March 1, India?s case remained unrepresented. 

 As the invitation for the global conference comes through the ministry of external affairs, those in the NRI ministry had no inkling about the invitation. 

 Sources said the foreign ministry had no one to spare for the conference. It could have passed on the information to the NRI ministry, which could have sent someone to represent the country. 

 Earlier, the NRI division was part of the external affairs ministry. When the United Progressive Alliance came to power, it decided to have an independent ministry for NRIs, where all issues relating to them would be brought under one roof. 

 Sections in the commerce and the labour ministries, which dealt with NRI issues, were also divested of their charge. The labour, foreign and the commerce ministries have been generally indifferent about giving the support the new ministry needs. 

 In September, when the second Asian Labour Ministerial Consultations were held in Manila, no minister represented India. The Indian ambassador, Navrekha Sharma, put across India?s views, but the absence of representatives from the NRI ministry was pointed out by the host nation, the Philippines.

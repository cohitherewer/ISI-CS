 Singh donates, minus photo-op

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Anil Ambani donated a crore. Shahrukh Khan, Karan Johar and Rani Mukherjee posed for photographs with Manmohan Singh after handing over a cheque of Rs 85 lakh for the Prime Minister?s relief fund.

 But, away from the spotlight, Singh was among the first donors to the fund when he gave away a month?s salary and added Rs 40,000 to the Rs 350-crore corpus.

 Money has been pouring into the fund from government institutions, banks and private donors. On January 4 alone, the contributions totalled Rs 52 crore, sources in the Prime Minister?s Office said.

 When the 2001 earthquake devastated Gujarat, it took a whole year for the relief fund to collect Rs 410 crore, while contributions after the 1999 Orissa supercyclone totalled Rs 125 crore.

 PMO sources said they have no intention of putting the names of contributors or the amount donated on the official website because of the ?unprecedented? response and the ?sensitivity? involved in deciding whose names should be mentioned and whose should not. ?How can we just give names of celebrities or those who made huge contributions and ignore donors who sent Rs 1,000 or less? The point is every paisa counts,? said a source.

 In keeping with certain rules evolved by the Centre since the fund was created in the 1950s, the money will be utilised entirely for tsunami victims ? first for ex gratia disbursement and later for funding rehabilitation packages. It will not be diverted elsewhere.

 It is for this reason that the Gujarat corpus is still being used in tranches of Rs 2-3 crore a month for the 10,000-odd victims, some of whom need expensive medical treatment. The interest earned on the corpus funds the medical expenses.

 To ensure that the relief amount reaches the victims, the PMO has devised a mechanism to disburse the money by drafts directly into their bank accounts and not through the state government.

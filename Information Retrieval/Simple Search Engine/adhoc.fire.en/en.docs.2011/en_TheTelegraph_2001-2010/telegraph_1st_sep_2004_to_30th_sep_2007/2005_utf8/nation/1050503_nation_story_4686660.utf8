 Land cry rides on peace bus

 OUR BUREAU

 Srinagar/New Delhi, May 2: 

 After a ride back to her roots, Fareeda Ghani now wants 

 her piece of land.

 Fareeda, who came to Srinagar on the first bus from Muzaffarabad on April 7 with her son, has lodged a property restoration claim with the custodian department. Her father, who migrated to Muzaffarabad in 1949, owned a lot of property at Srinagar?s prime locations. His palatial house in Nageen has been turned into the residence of Kashmir University?s vice-chancellor.

 The properties, left behind by those who migrated to Pakistan after Partition, were declared evacuee properties and are entrusted with the custodian department.

 Fareeda is not alone, though ? seven more Muzaffarabad residents are reported to have made a similar demand.

 But they might all end up empty-handed, going by the Supreme Court?s observations and the state government?s stand.

 While the apex court wondered how those travelling on tourist permits could lay claim to properties on this side of the border, chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed promised that the ?status of the evacuee property... would not be changed?.

 The Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre and Jammu and Kashmir on a petition saying ?visitors from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir? should not claim any property and the state and the Centre should not vest any property right?.

 It observed that there was already a stay order on the resettlement act that allows post-Partition migrants to PoK to come and stay in Jammu and Kashmir. Passed in 1981, the act also intended to empower displaced persons to get back their properties once they returned permanently to this side of Kashmir.

 The bench pointed out that the properties have been allotted to Indian Kashmiris and it would not be possible for them to give them up. ?Restoration of those properties? would create a crisis the local administration would not be able to handle,? said a political analyst.

 Appearing for the state, advocate Anis Suhrawardy said the government would not take a decision now on the applications from PoK visitors in view of the stay on the resettlement act.

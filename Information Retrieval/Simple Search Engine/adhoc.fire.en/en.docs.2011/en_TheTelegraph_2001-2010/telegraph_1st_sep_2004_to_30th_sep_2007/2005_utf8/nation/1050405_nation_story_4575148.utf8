 Zahira: Exposed?

 Mumbai/New Delhi, April 4: The Best Bakery retrial in the Mumbai special court took one more turn today with a police video contradicting statements by prime witness Zahira Sheikh and her family, raising doubts about their deposition.

 The screening came on a day the Gujarat government joined the war of words between Zahira, who has turned hostile, and her former mentor Teesta Setalvad. In an affidavit in the Supreme Court, it claimed that Zahira?s earlier allegations of ?unfair? trial were made while she was in the social activist?s ?custody?.

 The video, shot on behalf of Gujarat police on the morning of March 2, 2002, when the Vadodara bakery was still burning as a result of the assault the day before, shows several members of the Sheikh family who have deposed in the court. But significantly for the prosecution, it also shows two women whose presence the family has repeatedly denied.

 The video shows a very old woman, said to be Zahira?s maternal grandmother Hasina Sheikh, also referred to as Zareena Shahu, peering out from the terrace. The Sheikhs have denied that any relative was present at the bakery during the attack except Zahira, her siblings and her mother. They have categorically denied that Zahira?s grandmother ? ?nani? ? was present.

 Shahu, who is in her eighties, now lives in Jhakiya, her village in Dumariagunj, Uttar Pradesh. She did not depose, but told the newspaper Tehelka that she was present at the time of the attack that killed 14 people.

 It is assumed the Sheikhs did not want her presence to be noted because of apprehensions regarding her statements on Zahira?s maternal uncle Qausar. Qausar, who took over the bakery after Zahira?s father died of a heart attack, is believed to have been among the seven persons burnt on the first floor. But Zahira, her siblings and her mother have maintained they do not know what happened to him. 

 The video also shows Yasmin, the first wife of Zahira?s brother Nafitullah. The Sheikhs have been saying Yasmin was not present.

 Yasmin, who has appeared in the court, has said she was hiding on the terrace. She also said Zahira?s ?nani? was present and has accused Zahira and her family of taking money to turn hostile. The photographer, who deposed last week, also attested to the presence of a ?very old woman?.

 In the apex court, the Gujarat government said: ?It is stated that during the entire period from July 6, 2003, as averred by Setalvad... in her affidavit, up to November 3, 2004, when Zahira tendered her affidavit to collector, Vadodara, she (Zahira) was under the control and custody of Setalvad.?

 The government also accused Teesta of impersonating Zahira.

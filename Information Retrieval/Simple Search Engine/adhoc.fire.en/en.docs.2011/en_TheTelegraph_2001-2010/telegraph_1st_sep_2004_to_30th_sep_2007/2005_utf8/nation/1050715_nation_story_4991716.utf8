The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Glass house dilemma in Ayodhya 

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, July 14: The god who conquered a nation with bows and arrows may now be given bullet-proof security.

 The Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government are discussing a proposal to protect the Ram idol at the Ayodhya complex with bullet-proof glass and a wire-mesh against possible terrorist attacks.

 The apex court, however, has banned any kind of construction at the disputed site. 

 If needed, the government may go to the Supreme Court to seek permission for this kind of construction, an official said.

 The suggestion came at a high-level meeting of top state and central officials. It was part of plans to put in place high-tech security mechanisms at the Ayodhya complex, Gyanvapi Mosque, Kashi Vishwanath temple, Taj Mahal and Shahi Mosque-Krishna Janmabhoomi complex in Mathura by early next month.

 In Ayodhya, the height of the iron-pipe barricade may be raised from 10-12 feet to 25 feet and the CRPF security ring around the sanctum sanctorum widened to cover more than the current 2.77 acres.

 The proposals include barracks for commandos near the makeshift temple and round-the-clock surveillance of the roads around the acquired area by guards in bullet-proof vehicles.

 The number of watch towers may be increased to 30 and they may be made proof against fire and bullets and equipped with closed-circuit TV cameras and night-vision devices. The wall near Durahi Kuan may be raised to 40 feet and the security forces armed with sophisticated equipment.

 A committee will recommend measures by July 25-26 after which a team of technical experts from the Centre will visit the four places (Ayodhya, Varanasi, Mathura and Agra) to give their inputs. All reports will be finalised by August 6, said Union home secretary V.K. Duggal.

 Till then, the paramilitary forces and state government are taking several short-term measures, such as stationing more security personnel, intensifying patrol and improving the monitoring system.

 Todays meeting discussed a possible role played by the Students Islamic Movement of India in last weeks militant attack in Ayodhya. They decided the organisation should be put under close watch by both central and state intelligence networks.

 The meeting was attended by Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Neera Yadav, director-general of police Yashpal Singh, Union special secretary (internal security) Anil Chaudhary, CRPF director-general J.K. Sinha, state principal secretary (home) Alok Sinha, senior intelligence officials, security experts and the police commissioners of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Mathura and Agra.

 HC brakes on Siachen sentence

New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court on Tuesday restrained the 

army from confirming the sentence awarded to Major Surinder Singh, who was found 

guilty by the general court martial of faking encounters with the enemy on the 

Siachen glacier.

 ?The sentence awarded to the petitioner (Major Singh) shall not be confirmed till further orders by this court,? a bench of Justices D.K. Jain and H.R. Malhotra said.

 The order was passed after additional solicitor-general P.P. Malhotra told the bench that the Centre will not confirm the proceedings of the general court martial against Major Singh till further order.

 The court issued notices to the defence ministry and army authorities, asking them to file replies within two weeks and fixed February 15 for further hearing.

 Major Singh, a Gorkha Rifles officer, was dismissed from service and sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment on December 21 after he was found guilty of all charges by the court martial held in Jodhpur in August-September last year.

 He has approached the court for a stay on further proceedings with regard to the confirmation of findings and sentence awarded to him during the pendency of his petition and also sought the records of the proceedings.

 Father kills children 

Hyderabad: Police are hunting for a man suspected of strangling 

two infants and leaving them to be devoured by scavengers to take revenge against 

his wives reports our correspondent. 

 Dilip Kumar, a 36-year-old tribal, had married two sisters, Sravanti and Manjula, and had three children by them. One had died two months ago because of illness. 

 The marital life of the factory worker, who lived at Alwal on the outskirts of the city, turned turbulent following the loss of his job two years ago. His wives threw him out for beating them and getting involved in drunken brawls. 

 Dilip Kumar?s anger was building against his wives as he wanted to live with them but they always refused to do so. Last Sunday, he kidnapped his two children, strangled them and left their bodies in a deserted place.

 After a futile search throughout the night, the mothers gave up hope and filed a complaint against their husband. The half-eaten bodies of the children were found by the rail track half-a-km from their houses.

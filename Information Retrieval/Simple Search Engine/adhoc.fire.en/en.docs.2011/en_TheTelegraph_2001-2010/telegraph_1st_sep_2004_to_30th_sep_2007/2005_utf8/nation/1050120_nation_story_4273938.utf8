 Patna, Jan. 19: Six-year-old Kriti Kamana, confused and scared, held out a photograph of her elder brother as a television camera came to life at her family?s residence in Patel Nagar here.

 Her father Krishnakant Gupta, an assistant commissioner in the central Intelligence Bureau?s sales tax department, was at a loss for words, much like his wife Manju Gupta, a schoolteacher.

 The abduction of their 14-year-old son, Kislay Kaushal, has left them shocked and bewildered. A student of Delhi Public School, Khagaul, Kaushal was abducted this morning while he was on his way to school.

 Eyewitness Yash Kumar, after recovering from the initial shock, wasted no time and ran to Kaushal?s house to inform his parents of the abduction. According to sources, the abductors were said to be four in number.

 ?My son Kaushal and his classmate Yash Kumar had hardly walked 100 ft to catch the school bus when a Tata Sumo stopped in front of them. Two men jumped out of the vehicle, picked up Kaushal and sped off. It was around 6.15 in the morning,? Gupta said.

 ?I just can?t think of a person who is hostile to us nor do I have enmity with anyone,? he added.

 ?Prima facie it appears to be a case of kidnap for ransom. There seems to be no reason to suspect any other motive,? city superintendent of police Shalin said. Patna police have constituted a high-level task force under the SP?s supervision to trace the abducted student.

 ?We alerted all police stations in the capital immediately after getting the report of the abduction. We also sealed all exit points and started checking vehicles at several places,? the SP said.

 While the police continued their search for Kaushal, Gupta was confident that they would be able to rescue his son soon. ?I am happy with the action the police have taken so far,? he said.

 Gupta?s colleagues in the sales tax department warned the government that they would launch an agitation if the police do not rescue Kaushal within 48 hours.

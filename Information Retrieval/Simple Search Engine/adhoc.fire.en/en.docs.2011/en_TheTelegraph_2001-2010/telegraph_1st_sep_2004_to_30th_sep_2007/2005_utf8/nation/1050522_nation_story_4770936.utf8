 Dara to knock on SC door

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 21: Two days after Orissa High Court commuted Dara Singhs death sentence to life term, the man convicted of killing Graham Staines and his two sons said he wants to move the Supreme Court for his acquittal.

 In an interview to a television channel from Baripada circle jail, where he is now lodged, Dara said: I will go to the apex court to get justice. 

 I am innocent and I have full faith in the judiciary, he said. His lawyer Bana Bihari Mohanty said as much. 

 In September 2003, a designated CBI court had awarded Dara the death penalty and life term to 12 others in the murder. But on Thursday, Orissa High Court set aside Daras death sentence and acquitted 11 of the 12 who were given life terms.

 Dara said he was not linked to any political outfit but would join politics once acquitted. I will decide on the political outfit after I am released, he said.

 Dara has now been shifted to a normal cell from the special one after the high court order was communicated to the jail. 

 The order also removed the curtain of silence around Dara, allowing his long-standing demand to speak to mediapersons. Prisoners on death row are not allowed to speak to the media according to the Orissa jail manual regulations.

 Cloud on eviction notice

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 18: With the Orissa government relentlessly executing the eviction of illegal Bangladeshi migrants from Kendrapara district, those on the deportation list are desperately trying to stall the move.

 Yesterday, a section of Bangladeshi settlers formed the Utkal Bangiya Surakshya Samiti. The samiti, which also includes local Oriyas, sent petitions to President APJ Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to draw their attention to the ?injustice? done by the Naveen Patnaik government. 

 Sources in the samiti alleged that revenue officials have included the names of those persons on the deportation list who refused to pay bribes. 

 Tension prevailed in the seaside villages of the district today after government officials and schoolteachers aided the police in serving the ?Quit India? notice on 256 settlers, taking the total to 493. 

 Yesterday, police officers knocked on several doors asking the settlers to leave the country within 30 days. Though some of the migrants argued that that they hailed from South 24-Parganas in West Bengal, they were allegedly forced to sign the papers. All the 135 who were served the notice yesterday were residents of Kharinasi revenue circle in Mahakalpada block. 

 Security has been beefed up in the coastal areas of the state with the deployment of two platoons of policemen to check any untoward incident, said superintendent of police Dayal Gangwar. 

 While the administration continues to serve the notice, the list has come under a cloud of suspicion as many settlers are armed with documents, which could prove that they are not illegal migrants. 

 According to sources, several of these ?shortlisted? settlers have valid passports, PAN cards and voters? identity cards. 

 But the district administration and the government do not seem to be in a mood to listen to their pleas. The migrants will be arrested and handed over to the Border Security Force if they fail to comply with the order, said district collector Hemant Sharma. In such a situation, the settlers will have no option but to move court to seek ?justice?, sources said.

 The concentration of Bangladeshi migrants is the heaviest in the coastal pockets of the district. They are responsible for the denudation of the mangrove forest cover, Sharma added.

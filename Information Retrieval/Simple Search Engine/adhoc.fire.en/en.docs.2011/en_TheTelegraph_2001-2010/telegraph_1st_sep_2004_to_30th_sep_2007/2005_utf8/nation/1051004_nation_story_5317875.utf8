 Court licence for garba revelry

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 3: Before the revelry, the licence.

 Residents of Gujarat began celebrating Navratri a day early after the Supreme Court relaxed the 10 pm deadline for loudspeakers till midnight.

 The relaxation would come as welcome relief not only for garba enthusiasts but also for all those involved with the nine nights of festivities ? like musicians, decorators and caterers. At stake was the livelihood of thousands.

 The apex court, which had earlier set 10 pm as the deadline for use of loudspeakers during the Ganesh Chaturthi festival in neighbouring Maharashtra, had last week rejected the state governments plea to relax the limit. The Congress, which had earlier agreed with the BJP to approach the court, then moved a plea. So when news of the relaxation reached Ahmedabad, the partys headquarters reverberated with firecrackers.

 V. Raj, spokesman for Karnavati Club ? a popular venue hired by garba organisers ? said the restrictions were coming in the way sponsorships. But with the court extending the deadline, the organisers are likely approach TV stars to make an appearance, one of the main attractions.

 Interestingly, while the BJP and the Congress were on the same side on the use of loudspeakers, the Congress is opposing the Vibrant Gujarat ? Navratri 2005, sponsored by the BJP-led state government.

 The chief minister has no business to organise Garba. Its a peoples festival. The government should not squander money, said Opposition leader Arjun Modhvadia said.

 Since 2003, the Narendra Modi government has been organising mega celebrations during Navratri, calling it Vibrant Gujarat to sell the states investment and tourism potential.

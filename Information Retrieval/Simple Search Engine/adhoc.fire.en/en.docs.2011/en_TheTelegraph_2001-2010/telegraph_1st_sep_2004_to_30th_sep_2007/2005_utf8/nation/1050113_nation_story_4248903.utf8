TREMORS

 Phuket, Jan. 12 (AFP): Poor Thai children, who could only fantasise about how affluent foreigners spent their holidays, got a glimpse of a different world when a four-star hotel on this tsunami-hit island turned some of its suites into temporary classrooms.

 Some 350 children, whose Baan Kamala Primary School was ripped apart by the waves on December 26, got a pleasant surprise this week when their school bus took them to the luxurious Kamala Bay Garden Resort.

 ?All my friends like it here. It?s very comfortable. There?s air-conditioning and television and we can use the swimming pool. It feels like we are on a holiday,? said nine-year-old Apinya Phuangkhew. 

 Nagore (Tamil Nadu) (PTI): The killer sea is their only hope for life. Fishermen here, who lost families and friends to the mammoth waves, are dying to return to the sea. ?Give us boats and fishing nets. We want to go to the sea and earn a livelihood on our own. For how many days more should we stand in such queues waiting for food and water?? asks Mayyalakan, a fisherman. 

 Port Blair (PTI): She should be in school herself. But 12-year-old Ashna Lucas finds herself on the other side of the classroom after the tsunami forced her school to close down. The student of Mount Carmel Convent has begun teaching toddlers at a relief camp.

 New Delhi: Maneka Gandhi has urged people to spare a thought for tsunami victims of the four-legged kind. Her NGO, People for Animals, has invited contributions to help care for the ?thousands of animal victims of the tsunami?. She expressed concern at the change in the behaviour of stray dogs in Nagapattinam. ?In this district, the dogs had started eating human flesh.... They became so violent that the collector ordered 80 dogs to be strangled and killed. This was about four days ago and then we stepped in and started a shelter there,? she said.

 New Delhi (PTI) A soccer team from Andaman and Nicobar will play matches across the country as the islands try to pick up the pieces. ?We are planning to organise matches in various places to help them overcome their psychological trauma,? sports minister Sunil Dutt said.

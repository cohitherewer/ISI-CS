 Farmer Amitabh wants more time

 Pune (PTI): Amitabh Bachchan, who was asked by Pune district authorities to submit documents by November 25 in support of his claim of being a farmer, has sought time till December 30.

 Under the Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act, 1963, only farmers can buy agricultural land in Maharashtra. The district authorities issued a notice to Bachchan earlier in November, seeking the original documents.

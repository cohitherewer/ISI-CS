 Foreign papers with riders

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 12: Foreign publishing houses will be allowed to print facsimile editions of their newspapers and journals in India, provided they do not contain local content or local advertisements. 

 A group of ministers today decided to relax the rules. The group included finance minister P. Chidambaram, home minister Shivraj Patil, information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy and communications and IT minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 The publishing houses will have to set up wholly-owned entities in the country and print only facsimile editions. 

 Alternatively, the overseas publishing houses will be allowed to establish joint ventures to publish their titles with the advantage of printing local content and carrying local ads. 

 In such cases, however, their investment in these ventures will be capped at 26 per cent with an Indian partner holding the remaining 74 per cent. These joint ventures will have to have an Indian editor and a board of directors that has a preponderance of resident Indians.

 RSS eyes swadeshi saviour

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Govindacharya

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: With Ayodhya, the Kanchi seer?s arrest and Sonia Gandhi?s ?foreign? origin making little or no impact on anyone other than its dedicated followers, the RSS has apparently picked on economics ? or more precisely the K.N. Govindacharya brand of ?alternative? model of economic development ? to recoup and make itself politically relevant again.

 Govindacharya, the former BJP ideologue who was out in the cold after being elbowed out of the party, resurfaced in the capital today to expound on the ?model? to a group of journalists.

 RSS sources admit that with the change in regime at the Centre, the semantics and substance of political discourse has begun to shift from the secular-communal polemics which dominated debates when the National Democratic Alliance was in power to economic issues. The organisation has to thus respond ?in kind? if it is to keep itself in circulation.

 The Sangh elected to have Govindacharya instead of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch enunciate its viewpoint because, according to sources, he is considered ?more articulate on esoteric aspects?. Also Govindacharya was the only BJP leader to have stuck to the ?swadeshi? line when the NDA was in power. Even Murli Manohar Joshi came through as ambivalent on occasions like when he pitched for foreign direct investment in the print media.

 Govindacharya has clarified that other organisations and individuals, besides the Sangh and the Manch, are supporting him. He said even those from the opposite end of the ideological spectrum like Sunilaam, the leader of the Samajwadi Party?s legislative wing in Madhya Pradesh, and former Madhya Pradesh bureaucrat B.D. Sharma, a follower of V.P. Singh, are backing him.

 Sangh sources said though the organisation ?distanced? itself from Govindacharya when A.B. Vajpayee wanted him out of the BJP, it returned to him because ?on economics, it considers the Swadeshi Manch a more credible spokesperson than the BJP?.

 The RSS and the ?millions of minds it represented? were reportedly upset with the BJP for reneging on its 1998 election manifesto which was committed to ?swadeshi?. ?When the party was in power, the RSS said little or nothing because it did not want to destabilise the government. Now it is watching the BJP carefully and trying not to involve itself with it,? said sources.

 Sources said the idea was that if the ?alternative? model ? which stresses on de-centralisation, diversity and de-marketisation as opposed to globalisation ? clicks, the RSS would officially claim it as an ideological progeny, involve its cadre in a ?largescale? movement and take on the UPA government, which they say is just as ?pro-globalisation? as the NDA despite Left pressure.

 Rebel note bomb ticks on Modi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 16: Narendra Modi could be in a spot of bother if rebel MLA Ramilaben Desais note alleging he was victimising and humiliating her does the rounds of the BJP national executive.

 Ramilaben recently stunned the BJP by threatening to set herself on fire if the chief minister and his coterie continued to harass her. She also feared she could be killed, as former home minister Haren Pandya had been, for standing up against Modi.

 Ramilaben was not seen in Gandhinagar today but there was a loud buzz about her note that encloses evidence that Modi had ordered the demolition of her house.

 Sources said the highly explosive note was specifically prepared for circulation at the Chennai meet. The note alleges she was being harassed by ministers close to Modi despite her association with the BJP since 1985.

 I fear that Modi, home minister Amit Shah and education minister Anandiben Patel may humiliate me further the way they did Haren Pandya. I fear for my life, the note said.

 But instead of being killed, I will prefer to kill myself. I will self-immolate.

 She alleged Modis brother had been instigating people against her in her Kheralu constituency and the chief minister threatened her saying she was in touch with Congress leaders and that I have been abusing him, which he has got recorded.

 Some time ago, another rebel leader Gordhan Zadaphia alleged his phone was being tapped. Additional DGP R.B. Sreekumar had told the Godhra probe panel Modi asked him to tap his rivals phones.

 24 hours of SMS housie 

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA 

 Mumbai, Feb. 22: There will be more work for your mobile while watching television. In fact, it can now work 24x7. 

 Essel Group, which owns Zee Network, announced that it will start PlayTV, a 24-hour channel devoted to gaming and interactive programmes. It is likely to be launched in the second week of March. 

 ?Along with the regular entertainment content like movies, music and reality shows, PlayTV will provide gaming news, contests, bidding and shopping. This will be on real time basis through SMS, email and chat,? Zee said. Scrolls will appear inviting the viewer to a game of housie, or to crack a jumble, even as lanky models walk in the background.

 The idea was prompted by the rapid expansion of the global gaming market, which stands at $30 billion today. The network said this would be the first such Asian channel. 

 But winning may not always turn into money. ?We may give away gift hampers as prizes,? the network said.

 The channel also hopes to win over advertisers and media planners with the new concept, as it feels that it will be a platform for advertisers to display their products.

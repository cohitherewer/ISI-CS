 Karat backs, Cong hits back

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat believes the Congress need not be apologetic about the Volcker committees report on the Iraqi oil-for-food programme.

 He neednt have worried.

 After dithering for days, the Congress today hit back at the NDA, saying the former ruling alliance spawned the biggest scam-tainted government in independent India.

 Party spokesperson Jayanti Natarajan called the BJP and its allies a bunch of political nomads whose sole reason for existence seems to malign and defame the Congress president.

 The counter-attack followed NDA convener George Fernandess allegation that Natwar Singh, who along with the party was named as a non-contractual beneficiary of the scheme, was made a scapegoat to take the heat off the Congress and its chief.

 Karats comment came in the latest issue of Peoples Democracy, the CPM mouthpiece. The Congress Party need not be apologetic or defensive about its ties with Iraq and other third world countries and organisations which were intent upon defending their national sovereignty, Karat says.

 The Congress Party and Natwar Singh as chairman of the foreign affairs cell of the AICC maintained relations with Iraq and the Baathist party during the entire period when sanctions were imposed and the attacks on Iraq were continuing.

 Karat also fears Natwars exit will strengthen the pro-US lobby within the government. In the recent period the UPA government has taken a series of steps which are a violation of the independent foreign policy it has promised. The Indo-US defence framework agreement, the Indo-US joint statement of July 18 and the vote in the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) on the Iran nuclear issue are such instances.

 India had voted with the US and the European Union against Irans nuclear programme at the IAEAs September meet in Vienna.

 Without saying it in so many words, Karat seems to suggest that Natwar has been a victim of a US-sponsored plot to get rid of its critics.

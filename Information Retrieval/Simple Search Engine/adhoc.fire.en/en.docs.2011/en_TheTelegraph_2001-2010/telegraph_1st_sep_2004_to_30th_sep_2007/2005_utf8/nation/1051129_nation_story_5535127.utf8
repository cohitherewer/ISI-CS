 Abu Salem: Threatened?

 Mumbai, Nov. 28: Abu Salems lawyers today moved the Maharashtra Human Rights Commission, alleging that the deported gangster is being tortured in police custody.

 When I met him in the morning, the left side of his face and his left eye were swollen, said his lawyer Ashok Sarogi. He also told me that they covered his eyes by tying a piece of cloth and gagged him with another.

 Sarogi said the police also threatened Salem that he has to sign a confession.

 My client is apprehensive that the police will use physical force on him to sign a confessional statement. Yesterday, some senior officers visited him, who said he should sign the statement. Otherwise, they said that if they got him back into police custody, they could do anything, Sarogi said.

 Sarogi added that the police had threatened Salem that there would be dire consequences if he opens his mouth before the court.

 The human rights commission, which Salems lawyers have requested to send a representative to the police station where he is lodged, will hear the application tomorrow.

 The police maintain Salem has not been tortured and the allegations are part of defence strategy. They took Salem for a medical examination immediately after his lawyers alleged torture last week and said the report did not bear any evidence of the charge.

 Sarogi said that today, too, the police claimed there was no torture.

 Tomorrow, Salem will be produced before a Tada judge, who will consider extension of his police custody in the light of the torture charge. Salems lawyers had made an application before the court, making the allegation. After hearing it, the court said he would have to be produced tomorrow. The police have been allowed custody till December 2.

 Salem, who was previously being questioned by the CBI for his alleged involvement in the bomb blasts in Mumbai in 1993, was moved to police custody on November 24 from judicial custody.

 The police are interrogating him in connection with the murder of builder Pradeep Jain. They are likely to seek his custody again to question him about the killing of Ajit Diwani, secretary to actors Manisha Koirala and Aftab Shivdasani.

 Salem is lodged at the Bhoiwada lock-up in Wadala where he is being interrogated by the anti-terrorist squad, consisting of five members ? an assistant commissioner of police, two inspectors and two assistant police inspectors.

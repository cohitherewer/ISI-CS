 Modi revolt brews

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, March 9: Rebel Gujarat BJP legislators today huddled at former chief minister Keshubhai Patel?s Gandhinagar home to chalk out a strategy to remove Narendra Modi as chief minister.

 Surat MLA Dheeru Gajera said 65 rebels were ?seeking change of leadership?. They were unhappy because Modi had made it a point to constantly insult them and hardly ever gave them an ear. As he preferred talking to bureaucrats, very little of their work as MLAs was getting done, Gajera said.

 Five MPs ? Kashiram Rana, Vallabh Kathira, A.K. Patel, Soma Patel and Keshubhai himself ? and former chief minister Suresh Mehta attended the meeting. The MPs then left for Delhi where they are expected to meet BJP chief L.K. Advani to brief him on the brewing crisis.

 Keshubhai, Modi?s archrival, is believed to be fuelling the rebellion. So far, he had been managing the show from backstage but now seems to take the leadership position.

 Dissident MLA Purushottam Solanki, who had dubbed Modi ?Hitler?, said the rebels had conveyed their stand to the leadership and it was now up to the high command to take a decision.

 If the rebels? claim that 65 MLAs attended the meeting is true, Modi no longer enjoys the popular support of his party. The BJP has 127 MLAs in a 182-member House.

 But a party insider close to Modi said only 38 MLAs had attended the meeting.

 The dissidents have been trying to push their candidate for Gujarat BJP chief but Modi has been blocking it as he wants one of his lieutenants in the chair. As a result, Rajendrasinh Rana ?whose tenure expired two years ago ?is continuing as ad hoc unit chief.

 The two names suggested by the rebels for the post ?Vallabh Kathira and A.K. Patel ? are not acceptable to Modi as both are hostile to him. Modi?s loyalists said the high command was likely to work out a compromise after March 11.

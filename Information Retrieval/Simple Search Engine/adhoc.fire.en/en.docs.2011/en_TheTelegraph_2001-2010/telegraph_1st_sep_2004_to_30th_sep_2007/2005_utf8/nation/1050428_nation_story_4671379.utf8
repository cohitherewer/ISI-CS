 Court glare on mosque promise

 New Delhi: Delhi High Court has took 

 exception to Manmohan Singh?s communication to Imam Syed 

 Ahmed Bukhari that the Jama Masjid would not be declared 

 a protected monument and asked the culture ministry to produce 

 records relating to the decision, reports our correspondent.

 The order came after the counsel for the Archaeological Survey of India, Sanjay Jain, said the Prime Minister had already written to Bukhari about the decision. 

 The court ? which was hearing a PIL seeking declaration of the 355-year-old mosque as a protected monument ? wanted to know how the decision was taken when the matter was sub judice. 

 Then ASI counsel Jain said the monument can 

 be preserved without being declared a protected one, the 

 court shot back: ?Why are the authorities shying away? Are 

 you afraid of anybody??

 The mosque, currently administered by the Delhi Wakf Board, has been against moves to declare it a protected monument. There is apprehension that once it is declared as one, the ASI would have effective control over it and there would be restrictions on offering prayers at the mosque.

 The court suggested that the Wakf board control the affairs inside the mosque and the ASI outside it. It asked both parties to examine the matter in the light of the suggestion and assist it on May 25, the next date of hearing.

 Delhi swimming pools sealed 

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi police sealed 

 at least 15 swimming pools in the city, including one run

 Dutt seat for daughter

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Priya Dutt

 New Delhi, July 1: Sonia Gandhi has nipped in the bud the jostling for the late Sunil Dutts Mumbai North-West Lok Sabha seat by giving it to his elder daughter Priya.

 The decision was announced by Congress spokesman Abhishekh Singhvi this evening after Priya and her brother, actor Sunjay Dutt, met Sonia.

 The announcement of Priyas name for the constituency was rather unusual as the by-election to the seat is expected only in October-November, when the Bihar Assembly polls will be held. 

 But the move has ended the hopes of several aspirants, including Andhra Pradesh governor and former Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, who has been eyeing a return to active politics.

 Priya had been tipped for the seat ever since the Union sports minister died in May. She has been closely associated with her fathers political programmes.

 Priya, the elder of Sunil Dutts two daughters, was the late actors campaign manager during the last election and had been nursing the constituency on his behalf.

 Priya had accompanied her father through his peace march in Punjab during the height of terrorism in the state. 

 She was also part of Sunil Dutts sadbhavana yatra, undertaken in several parts of the country to promote peace and communal harmony, before the 2004 Lok Sabha polls.

 Sunjay had on June 1 hinted that Priya was likely to contest the polls from the seat. But a couple of days later, he said: The family will decide who is going to contest the elections.

 Sunil Dutt had won Mumbai North-West five times.

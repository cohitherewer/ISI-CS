 Siachen reminder to Pranab

 New Delhi, Sept. 29 (Agencies): Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee has sought to put a positive spin to an agreement between India and Pakistan to withdraw troops from Siachen, prompting Islamabad to underscore the major differences on the modalities of the pullout.

 We have agreed. They (Pakistan) have agreed to withdraw troops from the present positions. There are no two opinions about it, Mukherjee said in a TV interview.

 The disagreement is where we are demanding that we must identify the places, delineate the places (where) we were before withdrawal, so that there is a record, the minister said. The Pakistani point of view is that when we have agreed to withdraw from the respective positions, what is the relevance after the withdrawal agreement is signed. 

 Reacting to Mukherjees statement, the Pakistan foreign office said the two countries are engaged in intense negotiations to reach an early agreement. But it added that there were some major differences on the modalities of withdrawal, which the two sides are trying to address.

 Congress considers Sayeed status quo

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Oct. 23: Sonia Gandhi is inclined to forego the Congress partys turn to lead the coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir during the second half of the six-year term beginning next month. 

 Unless there is a rethink, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed of the Peoples Democratic Party will continue as chief minister. 

 Just over a week ahead of the scheduled transfer of power as envisaged under the October 2002 agreement between the two parties, the Congress president today held consultations here with Mufti and his daughter Mehbooba Mufti.

 Later, she met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss the issue.

 Sonias discussions with the top PDP leaders was interpreted in political circles in the capital as an indication that she has second thoughts on her party taking up the responsibility of leading the coalition ministry in the sensitive state.

 Though the PDP won fewer seats than the Congress, Mufti successfully argued with Sonia that his party, being the larger of the two partners in the Kashmir Valley, must be given the first shot at the chief ministership. 

 The Valley-primacy argument is understood to be again strengthening the case for Muftis continuance. Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Congress partys candidate for the job, is not from the Valley, where the wounds of years of militancy are still raw. Besides, Azad, entrenched in Delhi as a key Union minister, is not too keen to shift to Srinagar. 

 While Sonias discussions with Mufti and his daughter signalled her readiness to rewrite the power-sharing agreement, there was no official word from the party about the outcome of the talks.

 Sources said it may take some more days before the party reaches a final view. 

 Sonia, who had yesterday invited the PDP leaders for talks in the capital, held two rounds of consultations with her senior colleagues ahead of the meetings with the father and daughter. 

 Among those involved in the intra-party consultations were Azad, Pranab Mukherjee and Ahmad Patel. Mukherjee, Sonias troubleshooter, held separate talks with Mufti and Mehbooba. 

 According to sources close to Mukherjee, the defence minister prepared the ground for the two PDP leaders cordial meeting with Sonia later. However, the sources said, the Congress president is expected to hold more extensive consultations in the party before taking a final decision.

 Sonias move to invite Mufti to Delhi for the talks came after the chief minister indicted that he may quit on his own on November 2 if there was no clarification from the Congress.

 Evasive about implementing the agreement, the Congress leadership has been saying for the past two weeks that its immediate attention was focused on proving relief and rehabilitation to the people affected by earthquake.

 Speculation was rife in party circles that the power transfer could be delayed by a few months because of the earthquake. Mufti is not keen on continuing in office on an ad hoc basis.

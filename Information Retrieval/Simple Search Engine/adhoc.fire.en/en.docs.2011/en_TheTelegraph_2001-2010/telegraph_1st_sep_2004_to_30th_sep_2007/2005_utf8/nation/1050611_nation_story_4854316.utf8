 Pincer strike on Buta 

 - NDA taps Kalam, dissolution case comes up in SC

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, June 10: Governor Buta Singh was in the line of NDA fire today, with his role in the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly being brought up in the Supreme Court and with the President. 

 In the apex court, the stage appears set for a constitutional debate not taken up even in the oft-quoted S.R. Bommai case ? whether a governors action in recommending dissolution of an Assembly is mala fide. 

 A vacation bench of the Supreme Court today asked the Centre to explain in an affidavit the reasons for the Bihar Assemblys dissolution. It will have to file its reply within two weeks, arguing how a prima facie case is not made out. 

 The petitioners, four MLAs of the dissolved Assembly, including two from the NDA, one an LJP rebel and an Independent, will reply to that affidavit a week thereafter. They have accused the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre of subverting democracy. 

 Hearings have, therefore, been postponed till the first week of July, when the court sits after its summer vacation.

 Mukul Rohtagi, arguing for the petitioners, said a discussion on the governors partisan role did not figure even in Bommai case. 

 In the Bommai case (dissolution of Karnataka Assembly with S.R. Bommai as chief minister), the Supreme Court had said it should not be to the subjective satisfaction of a governor to recommend dissolution of an Assembly and that he should explore ways to form a government.

 Buta did not even call the MLAs, Rohtagi said. The petitioners submitted the names of 22 of the LJPs 29 MLAs who had agreed to merge with Janata Dal (U).

 Without even trying to meet the MLAs and assessing the strength of Nitish Kumar (which Rohtagi put at 135), the governor decided to recommend the dissolution?. What is the reason for this tearing hurry? Rohtagi asked. Because someone you (governor) do not want would stake the claim to form the government. 

 This is against the democratic practice and spirit of our Constitution, he argued. 

 At this, the bench of Justices P. Venkatarama Reddi and Arijit Passayat said there was scope for limited judicial review in the matter and asked the Centres counsel, Gopal Subramaniam, to file the affidavit. But it did not issue any notice.

 Outside the court, the battle against Buta was taken to Rashtrapati Bhavan, with an NDA team that included L.K. Advani and George Fernandes parading 126 MLAs of the dissolved House before President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to prove they had the numbers to form the government. Six more MLAs had given letters of support, BJP leader Arun Jaitley said later.

 The President was misled about the situation in Bihar, Jaitley added. 

 The Congress dismissed the NDA move as showbazee. It was a funny, leaderless delegation, said spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi.

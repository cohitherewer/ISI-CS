 Common schools on Delhi desk

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The government is trying to revive the debate on a common school system first recommended by the Kothari Commission on education 40 years ago.

 The bill on free and compulsory education for children between 6 and 14, expected to be passed in the next Parliament session, underlines the need for a common system to reduce the widening gap between high- and low-grade schools.

 Ideally, every school should have a mix of students from different social backgrounds, says Anita Rampal, a member of the Central Advisory Board of Education (Cabe). 

 Although premier private schools make a commitment to keep aside 25 per cent of seats for poor neighbourhood children, few honour it.

 The Supreme Court had recently asked the schools to keep their word, but policymakers and academics believe there is still a wall of resistance to allowing poor students entry into the elite schools. This, they stress, can be broken through a common school system.

 A common school system requires every neighbourhood to have a good government school equipped with the infrastructure and facilities that private schools provide. The perception is that the management and teachers of the common schools will be more accountable because the rich will act as a pressure group. The idea, policymakers say, is not to downgrade private schools but to upgrade the existing poor quality government schools. 

 One of the ways could be to upgrade the Kendriya Vidyalayas which have a mix of students from different social backgrounds, says a human resource development ministry official. Kendriya Vidyalayas are under the direct control of the ministry.

 The current system promotes a clear segregation between well-heeled and poor students. The rich study in English-medium schools affiliated to the CBSE, ICSE and the IB (International Baccalaureate) boards. The schools offer globally accepted curricula. 

 English-medium government-aided schools affiliated to state-level examination boards are next in the hierarchy. These are attended by middle-class children. On the lowest rung are government and municipal schools which suffer from rampant teacher absenteeism and bad infrastructure.

 We must have common spaces for children. We cannot just relegate the poorer children to government schools, says Rampal. A system that will end this segregation will have to be pushed through.

 Experts say the bill on free and compulsory education shows that the Centre is serious about removing educational disparities as it cites a common school system as a goal.

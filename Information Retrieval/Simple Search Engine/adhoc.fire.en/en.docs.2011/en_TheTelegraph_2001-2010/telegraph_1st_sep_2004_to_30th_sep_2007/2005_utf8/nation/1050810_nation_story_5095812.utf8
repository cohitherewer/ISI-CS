 Aug. 9: Terror attacks continued in Assam for the fourth day today, with a killing in Karbi Anglong district and power and gas lines being targeted in Upper Assam. 

 Militants suspected to be from the Karbi Longri NC Hills Liberation Front shot dead the conductor of a truck in Karbi Anglong while the banned Ulfa blew up a high-tension power line tower and a gas pipeline in Upper Assam.

 Police said suspected KLNLF militants opened fire on a convoy of six trucks, carrying rice from Hojai to Diphu. The attack took place at Howraghat, 40 km from Diphu town, killing a conductor on the spot at 5 am.

 A Diphu police official said a group of KLNLF rebels laid an ambush in a jungle when the trucks running through NH 36 crossed the area. More than 50 rounds were fired from AK-47 rifles on the trucks. One driver was critically injured.

 In Upper Assam, militants blew up a high tension power line tower at Tengahola village in Golaghat district today.

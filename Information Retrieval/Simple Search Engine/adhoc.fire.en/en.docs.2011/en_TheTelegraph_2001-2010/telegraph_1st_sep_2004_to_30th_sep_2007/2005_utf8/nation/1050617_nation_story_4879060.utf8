 Net chat drives teen to kidnap

 Mumbai (PTI): A teenager, for whom chatting 

 with women online had become an obsession, was arrested 

 on Wednesday for kidnapping a three-year-old from suburban 

 Kurla to raise money for paying Internet bills and giving 

 gifts to chat partners.

 Mohseen alias Sheru, 19, was caught by police when he called up Zains family at Vinoba Bhawe Nagar in Kurla and demanded Rs 35,000 to release the child. The accused was remanded in police custody till June 28, police said.

 The teenager hails from Akbarpur in Uttar Pradesh, where he completed his schooling before the family shifted to Mumbai, according to deputy commissioner of police Ashutosh Dumbare. The teenagers interest in studies, the police officer said, faded and he dropped out of college.

 Mohseen got hooked to the Internet and spent hours chatting with women, Dumbare said. Mohseen was so obsessed with chatting on the Net that he started stealing valuables from home to meet his needs. This habit of stealing eventually forced his family to throw him out of the house, the police official said.

 He then worked as a caretaker at an Internet caf? in Kurla, which allowed him to chat for long. 

 Mohseens family knew Zains family, Dumbare said, adding the teenager had earlier borrowed money from the childs mother, Parveen Nazir Dabir, and had not returned it.

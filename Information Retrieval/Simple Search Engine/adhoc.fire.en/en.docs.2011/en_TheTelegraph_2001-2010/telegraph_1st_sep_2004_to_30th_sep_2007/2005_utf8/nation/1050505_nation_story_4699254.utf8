 No believer can skip Shirdi: Judge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, May 4: Justice S.N. Phukan today said he had not compromised on investigations in the defence deal by travelling in an air force aircraft.

 He said that in the highly secured defence establishments which he had to visit for the sake of investigations, only a defence aircraft would have been allowed access.

 Speaking to reporters here hours after defence minister Pranab Mukherjee?s statement in Parliament, the Tehelka commission chief said he did not ask for any aircraft from the government for his tour to defence establishments. He had asked the secretary to the commission to arrange the trip, Phukan said.

 The retired judge also heads the Assam Human Rights Commission. He said nobody could question his integrity in his long judicial career.

 The former Supreme Court judge also denied media reports that he had given a clean chit to George Fernandes.

 Phukan said it was for the court to acquit any person. But he added that in his report, he did mention that ?I did not find anything serious against his reputation?.

 ?I have submitted my report. The truth will come out when the report will be published,? he added.

 Phukan also rubbished a report which said that he, along with his wife and officials, had gone on a ?week-long junket? to Shirdi, Mumbai and Ahmednagar from Delhi. 

 ?My terms of appointment (as the chairman of the commission of inquiry) was similar to that of Justice Venkataswami. It was clearly mentioned in the terms of appointment that I can take my wife from Guwahati to Delhi and she can accompany me on my tours in connection with the probe,? he said.

 Phukan said his wife was ill and it was not possible for him to leave her behind alone in Delhi.

 He also refuted the allegation that his tour was a pleasure trip. It was necessary to go and see the weapon systems and other equipment for the sake of investigations as he was probing the defence deals, he added.

 Phukan justified his visit to Shirdi where there was no defence establishment, saying that no Hindu, unless he was a non-believer, could have come back without visiting the place after visiting Ahmednagar.

 ?Since I went to Ahmednagar, I couldn?t have come back without visiting Shirdi,? he added.

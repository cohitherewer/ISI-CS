 Tsunami scare at Cong meet 

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Oct. 8: First the glasses shook. Then the tables rocked and the chairs shivered.

 Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh was on the podium with Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, discussing how best to take social welfare schemes to the people, when the earthquake struck. Manmohan had finished his speech minutes earlier.

 Less than 30 seconds later, the Punjab Bhavan hall where the Congress chief ministers conclave was into its second day was cleared out by the SPG.

 Out on the lawn, Sonia took charge, asking home minister Shivraj Patil to find out where the epicentre lay and make arrangements for relief where needed.

 I was the last to get out, said Jairam Ramesh, a member of the party think tank.

 Ahmad Patel, Sonias political secretary, said he stayed put inside the recently refurbished conference hall packed with false ceilings till the others had been taken to safety. 

 It was a horrifying experience. Somebody seemed to be pulling me out of my chair. It was a tsunami of a different kind, said former Kerala chief minister A.K. Antony. 

 The Congress leaders, who were told to stay in a corner of the lawn till danger passed, resumed their meeting once the tremors stopped.

 I am worried about the effect on the far-flung and remote mountainous areas of my state, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh said as he tried to gather information. Sab theek hai na mere pradesh mein (Is everything ok in my state)? he asked an officer. 

 Ditto for Uttaranchals Narain Dutt Tiwari.

 Next door, at Haryana Niwas, where the media had been housed for the conclave, there was a mad scramble for the exit gate as chandeliers began shaking violently and a crack appeared in one of the walls. 

 A journalist covering the conclave had a miraculous escape as the false ceiling of his hotel bathroom came crashing down.

 This is the second earthquake in two days. Kal Bihar tha. Aaj bhukamp hai, another muttered.

 Outside in the city, cars came to a screeching halt and people jumped out. Those at home spilled out on the streets. Till long after the tremors had subsided, children continued wailing.

 We will have to sleep in the open tonight and perhaps for many more nights because of the aftershocks. The Gujarat tremors were terrifying. This one was horrifying, said Pappu Gujral, a resident of the upscale Sector 9.

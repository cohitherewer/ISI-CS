 Speaker in House call to Atal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chatterjee

New Delhi, May 3: Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today offered a way out for the Opposition to end its protest and return to Parliament as fissures surfaced within the National Democratic Alliance over its four-day-old boycott of House proceedings.

 Taking yet another initiative to end the UPA-NDA parliamentary deadlock, the Speaker today wrote to NDA chairperson Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 

 Assuring him that all matters of concern to the Opposition would be allowed to be discussed according to procedures, Chatterjee urged Vajpayee to lead the Opposition NDA back to the House.

 ?So far as I am concerned, I have always assured that all matters, which can be permitted, will be allowed to be raised and discussed in the House... I request you to please see that my friends in the NDA join the House and take part in the proceedings,? the Speaker stated in his letter to Vajpayee.

 Chatterjee?s move came soon after NDA leaders, who met this morning, decided to continue the boycott today after they returned to the Lok Sabha yesterday to pass the finance bill.

 There were indications from the BJP that the Speaker?s letter could be considered when NDA leaders meet tomorrow morning for a ?daily? review of the boycott decision. 

 ?Vajpayeeji has just received the letter at 4 pm. It will be taken into consideration when we meet for reviving the boycott tomorrow morning,? the BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, said.

 Sources said that before the Speaker appealed to Vajpayee, he had received feelers from the NDA about its willingness to return to Parliament if an honourable way out was found. 

 The Telugu Desam Party and sections of the Janata Dal (United) were unhappy with the indefinite boycott. The Desam stayed away from today?s meeting.

 The Speaker?s letter directly addresses the Opposition?s concerns. The NDA?s complaints are that the government was not responding to its demand for discussion on the tainted ministers, particularly Laloo Prasad Yadav, and treasury bench members were not allowing Opposition leaders to speak in the House.

 A Congress spokesperson, too, iterated that the government was ready to discuss all issues and accused the NDA of dishonouring the repeated pleas by the Speaker and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to end the boycott.

 The party dismissed speculation that the budget session could be adjourned sine die at the end of this week if the Opposition continued its boycott.

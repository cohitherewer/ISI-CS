 Witness tag back on Yadav daughter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: Delhi High Court today reversed a trial courts decision to drop former Rajya Sabha member D.P. Yadavs daughter Bharti as a witness in the Nitish Katara murder case.

 It directed the lower court to examine Bharti as a prosecution witness in the case.

 Yadavs son Vikas and nephew Vishal are facing trial for the abduction and murder of Nitish, the son of a senior IAS officer, in February 2002.

 The high courts order came from Justice R.S. Sodhi on a revision petition filed by Nitishs mother Neelam Katara, who challenged the trial courts order. 

 The high court said in its order that as Bharti was a material witness, she could not be dropped.

 Neelam had also asked that the passport office be told to cancel the passport of Bharti, so that she will be forced to return and record her statement before the court. Bharti, a classmate of Nitish, is studying in the UK.

 Nitish was allegedly kidnapped and murdered on the intervening night of February 16-17, 2002, from Ghaziabad, where he had gone to attend the marriage of a classmate. Later, his half-burnt body was recovered from Khurja in Uttar Pradesh.

 Vikas, out on bail in the Jessica Lal murder case, and his cousin, Vishal, were arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police in connection with the murder. 

 Vikas also contested the Assembly elections but lost.

 According to the police, Bhartis testimony was significant as her alleged relationship with Nitish was the motive behind the murder. 

 The police named her as the key witness and made all efforts to call her from the UK to appear before the court.

 Bharti was dropped as witness on March 30 following the UKs refusal to execute a non-bailable warrant against her. There were 36 witnesses in the case and Bharti was the only one left for examination. However, she resisted several attempts to get her to testify, which included the issuing of more than 25 bailable and non-bailable warrants.

 Neelam then moved Delhi High Court in an attempt to force Bharti to testify. The setback to the case had Vikas and Vishal attempt to secure bail.

 The high court, in an order on April 28, 2005, stayed the recording of statements of the accused till further orders and directed the trial court to keep in abeyance the order dropping Bharti as a witness in the case. 

 The bail petitions of the accused were rejected by the lower court, which observed that there was evidence against them.

 Vikas and Vishal had moved court for bail after the prosecution case appeared to take a battering with Bhartis non-appearance. 

 In addition, Shivani Gaur, the classmate of Nitish and Bharti, at whose wedding Nitish was last seen, denied any knowledge of the events.

 The defence counsel had pointed out that another witness, Ajay Katara ? he allegedly saw the accused driving away with Nitish on the night of February 16-17 ? had come out with his version of the events a month after the incident when the car number had already been splashed by the media.

 Pat for important Modi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: A day after the shock discovery of a mass grave in Gujarat, Narendra Modi was singled out for praise by L.K. Advani and allowed to speak longer than others at the BJP national convention.

 The media has been writing about Gujarat as if there is a civil war in the state BJP unit. They forget to make much of the fact that of the 129 seats in the Ahmedabad corporation elections, the BJP has won as many as 96 seats, the outgoing BJP president said.

 In the area falling in Gandhinagar, the party has won 39 of a total of 46 seats. Is this not an achievement for which the state leadership should be congratulated?

 Advani also praised Modi for outlawing cow slaughter. The bill Narendrabhai brought in the state was legally contested. But the Supreme Court approved it and gave a very well-argued judgment. Every state must follow Gujarats example, he said.

 Of all the chief ministers, Modi received the most enthusiastic welcome. Advani kept referring to him in reverential terms. Now I invite Narendrabhai to speak, he said as Modi approached the podium to loud cheer and applause from the over 3,500 delegates.

 Although Advani interrupted Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje as she listed her achievements, he allowed Modi to wax eloquent for over half an hour.

 Please finish early, others have to speak, Advani told Vasundhara. Advaniji, how can I recount the achievements of two years in 15 minutes? Please bear with me, she protested.

 The rush was for the benefit of Modi who was given the honour of being the last speaker. He did not touch on either the mass grave or the post-Godhra riots it is being linked to.

 Instead, he focused on development, obviously buffing up his image of vikas purush and Hindu hriday samrat.

 We have given three-phase, uninterrupted power supply to villages. We have improved agriculture income from Rs 9,000 crore to Rs 23,000 crore, he said.

 Insiders say Modi has emerged as one of the strongest leaders in the BJP despite the Gujarat riots. 

 We have told him to quietly do his work and not get embroiled in controversy. He is so popular in Gujarat that he can prepone Assembly elections and win by a handsome margin, a senior leader said.

 Modi is also believed to have become one of the principal financiers of the BJP. He finances everyones elections. He has become very important to the party, a source said.

 Disaster bill gets nod from Lok Sabha

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: The Lok Sabha today cleared the disaster management bill by a voice vote after home minister Shivraj Patil assured members that the Centre would take expeditious measures to help those affected by calamities. 

 The bill, which the government had decided to enact immediately after the December 26 tsunami last year, was passed by the Rajya Sabha last month. 

 The bill has been enacted under the entry of social security and social insurance in the concurrent list of the Constitution as that will allow state governments also to have their own legislation. 

 The bill seeks to provide punishment for obstructing response, making false claims, misappropriation of money or materials and issue of false warning. 

 It, however, provides immunity to government organisations and officers for action taken in good faith.

 Patil told the Lok Sabha that the bill provided for taking punitive action against departmental heads if they are found wanting in their duty. During a calamity, an official heading any wing of the disaster management authority should act like a team leader.

 The home minister also said a trained force would be raised to respond effectively in disaster situations. 

 The bill would institutionalise a mechanism at the national, state and district levels for responding to natural disasters and there would be accountability regarding funds released for disaster mitigation.

 The bill also provides for the setting up of a national disaster management authority under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, a state disaster management authority under the chief minister, a district authority under the district magistrate and local disaster management committees.

 It also provides for setting up a National Disaster Response Force, a National Institute of Disaster Management, National Fund for Disaster Response and National Fund for Disaster Mitigation and similar funds at the state level. 

 The National Disaster Response Force shall be constituted for specialist response in major cities.

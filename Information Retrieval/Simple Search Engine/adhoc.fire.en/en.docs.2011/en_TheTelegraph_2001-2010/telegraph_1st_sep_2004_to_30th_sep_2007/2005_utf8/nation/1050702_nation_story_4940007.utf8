 Murder cuffs on Jogi son

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Amit Jogi: Under cloud

 New Delhi, July 1: Amit Jogi, the son of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, was arrested by the CBI in a murder case today after being grilled for several hours.

 The bureau, sources said, wanted Amit in its custody to question him further on the murder of Chhattisgarh Nationalist Congress Party treasurer Ram Avtar Jaggi in 2003. He will be produced in court tomorrow.

 Amit, who was served the first notice on June 16, appeared at the CBI headquarters in Delhi this afternoon for questioning and remained there till late evening. 

 Officials decided to place him under arrest after he failed to answer questions properly, the sources said.

 Amit appeared before the CBI a day after its director, U.S. Misra, had said stern action would be taken if he continued to avoid the bureau.

 We have sent a second notice to him (Amit). We have been told that he will be appearing soon. Let us wait till then or else?. After all, the charges are serious, Misra had said.

 The shooting of NCP leader Jaggi on June 4, 2003, had stirred a political controversy. The case was later handed over to the CBI by the Raman Singh government in Chhattisgarh. 

 Some office-bearers of the state unit of the National Students Union of India, a wing of the Congress, had been arrested in connection with the murder.

 Amits name had come up during the interrogation of 14 accused. 

 The CBI started trailing him after two accused, Suresh and Bultu Pathak, named him, in a statement before a magistrate, as the man who provided the funds and chalked out the plan. 

 The statement also alleged that the state police had arrested several people merely to save some politicians named in the FIR, said the sources.

 Vivek shift draws Jaya fire

 - publicity blitz, says CM

 Vivek Oberoi: Aid trouble

 The rage of the killer sea brought out the altruist in him. Now, Vivek Oberoi has to contend with a different kind of fury ? of the human variety.

 Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa today slammed the Bollywood star?s rehabilitation efforts in tsunami-ravaged Devanampattinam village as a ?publicity blitz? more aimed at ?hogging the media limelight? after Vivek shifted the housing project he had planned to Karaikal in neighbouring Pondicherry.

 ?As far as Vivek Oberoi was concerned, it was the publicity blitz that was bigger, but what he did was very little,? Jayalalithaa said in the Assembly, a day after the actor had explained the reasons for his move.

 Vivek, who had ?adopted? Devanampattinam, a village in Tamil Nadu?s Cuddalore district, said he was forced to shift his initiative, christened Project Hope, as prospective donors ? corporates abroad ? ?had to close their books on March 31 and wanted specific commitments on the housing project by February-end.?

 The commitments the donors sought had to come from the state government in terms of land acquisition and allocation and rules for implementing housing projects for affected fishermen. The housing policy came too late ? it was announced last week ? for Vivek to hang on to Devanampattinam.

 But the actor, did not ?blame? anybody, ?least the Tamil Nadu government?. He said the state had to take its own time to ?assess? everything and the donors ?could not wait too long for financial year-end considerations?.

 Jayalalithaa, however, accused Vivek of trying to ride piggyback on the government?s relief and rehabilitation efforts to ?seek publicity for himself? and to project an impression that it was his ?personal effort?.

 While finance minister C. Ponnaiyan said Vivek had sought no approval for the housing project in Devanampattinam after the PMK raised the subject, Jayalalithaa was quickly on her feet to explain the ?Oberoi issue? in full.

 Even in areas where Vivek worked, Jayalalithaa said, it was the state government that had reached most of the relief material and cash doles to the victims. Whatever assistance Vivek had rendered, she added, ?it was not out of his own funds?. On the whole, she said, ?90 per cent of what was done (in villages in and around Devanampattinam) was the state?s effort and only 10 per cent was Oberoi?s contribution?.

 On the actor?s comment that his donors were ?backing out?, Jayalalithaa said Vivek had shifted to Pondicherry as he could not deliver on his commitments in Tamil Nadu.

 While Vivek was unavailable for comment, his father, actor Suresh Oberoi, said: ?Vivek did what he felt was right. He spent more than three-and-a-half months with the tsunami victims. We should not be making so much out of this. After all, we are not making money or fame out of this.?

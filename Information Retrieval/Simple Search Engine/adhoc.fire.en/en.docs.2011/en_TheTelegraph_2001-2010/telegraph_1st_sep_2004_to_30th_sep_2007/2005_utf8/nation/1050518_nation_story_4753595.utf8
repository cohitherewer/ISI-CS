 Palestine President comes calling

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Abbas

 New Delhi, May 17: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will arrive here on Thursday to discuss with Indian leaders the West Asia peace process and how the two sides can continue to sustain their traditional strong ties.

 Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen, will hold discussions with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and senior officials in South Block. He will leave on Friday.

 Announcing the Palestinian Presidents visit, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna spoke of Delhis consistent and unwavering support to the Palestinian cause and legitimate demand of an independent homeland. 

 He added that Delhi was in favour of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region on the basis of land for peace.

 This will be Abbass first visit to India since he was elected Palestinian President early this year. His stopover in Delhi is part of a tour of key nations in the region, including China and Pakistan, to apprise them of the latest on the West Asia peace process.

 The Palestinian President comes here at a time when a three-month-old ceasefire between Israel and his country threatens to come apart and push the two sides back to the old pattern of broken promises and mutual recriminations. If the truce holds it could lead to the disengagement by Israel from the Gaza Strip in the next few months.

 Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has already threatened to put the brakes on a proposed release of Palestinian prisoners and suspended the handover of security control in three West Bank cities till Palestine moves to disarm militant groups.

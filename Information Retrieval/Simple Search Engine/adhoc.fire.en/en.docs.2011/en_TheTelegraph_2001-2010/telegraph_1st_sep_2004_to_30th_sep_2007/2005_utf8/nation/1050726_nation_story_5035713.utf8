 Tax glare on Laloo 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 25: A closed income-tax case today re-surfaced to haunt railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and wife Rabri Devi as the Supreme Court asked for reports submitted by the director of investigations.

 The order came on a PIL by Rajiv Ranjan Singh Lallan of the Janata Dal (United) and Sushil Modi of the BJP seeking a directive for a proper probe against Laloo Prasad and Rabri. 

 A three-judge special bench of Justices S.N. Variava, A.R. Lakshmanan and S.H. Kapadia today said the date for final hearings would be fixed on July 29. 

 The court wanted the reports of the director of investigations. It said the reports were not pursued after the Patna Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal gave a clean chit to the couple. Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati agreed to give the reports in sealed covers. 

 Singh and Modi alleged that the couple was using political influence to get favourable orders in the income-tax and other cases related to the fodder scam.

 Petitioners counsel Mukul Rohtagi told the court that the special judge trying the case in Patna, Yogendra Prasad, had been transferred on June 4, a move, he said, stands testimony to the fact that the respondents are using their political influence.

 BJP aborted Ayodhya solution, hints Rao 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Rao: More out of closet

 Nov. 1: Its not only some of his cabinet colleagues that P.V. Narasimha Rao accuses of duplicity before and after the Babri Masjid demolition. In his book Ayodhya, set to be released on December 6, the late Prime Minister obliquely suggests that the BJP may have scuppered a possible solution to the temple dispute to keep the Ayodhya pot boiling.

 Till August 1992, Rao says, his talks with apolitical sadhus and sanyasis on how and where a Ram temple could be built in Ayodhya ? without breaking the law or upsetting communal harmony ? were proceeding quite well.

 Then, all of a sudden, the sadhus broke off the talks. Four months later, the mosque was demolished by hordes of kar sevaks.

 Why did they (the sadhus) go back on their promise (to explore all avenues towards a peaceful settlement of the dispute)? Rao wonders. 

 He then offers ? without naming the BJP ? what he feels is a plausible explanation: It was clear that there was a change of mind on their (the sadhus) part or, what is more likely, on the part of political forces that controlled them.

 These forces deliberately wanted to get out of? (a) friendly situation which the sanyasis were getting into with me and which, if left to itself, would have made the mandir issue wholly apolitical, Rao suggests.

 This subtle aspect of Ram Janmabhoomi matter is very important and brings home the undeniable fact that while Hindu masses were swayed by their devotion to Ram and their intense desire for the temple, the political forces behind the issue could not care less for the temple -- they only wanted to retain a long-term, vote-rich communal issue for as long as they could.

 Till August 1992, Rao had been in constant touch with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leadership at Nagpur to try and resolve the Ayodhya dispute amicably. Congress leaders such as V.N. Gadgil and Vasant Sathe acted as his emissaries.

 Rao had also sought the help of many apolitical saints, such as Jain Muni Acharya Sushil and his spiritual guru based in Ramtek (Maharashtra), to prevail upon the Sangh-Vishwa Hindu Parishad to go slow on Ayodhya.

 Several sadhus and sants ? such as Mahant Avaidyanath, Vamdeoji Maharaj, Ramchandradas Paramhans, Mahant Nrityagopal Das, Swami Paramanandji, Swami Chinmayananda and Pejawar Swamiji ? had held several meetings with Rao at 7 Race Course Road.

 After arguing that a political groups majority communal orientation and its need to keep Ayodhya as a permanent, evergreen issue led it to scuttle the talks, Rao makes an interesting point. He points out that the demand was not for just one temple ? more had been lined up, so that the agitation could be kept alive even if the issues of one or two specific temples were settled.

 The number was three (Ayodhya, Mathura, Kashi) and for good measure, in the unlikely event of all the three temple issues being settled amicably (unfortunately for them), there was a never-ending store of more than 3,000 controversial temples lined up all over the country! Rao writes.

 To his dismay, when he explained these finer points to his cabinet colleagues, they did not help him. Instead, they made him a scapegoat. It was me that they demolished, Rao rues.

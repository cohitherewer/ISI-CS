 Gutka baron reaches India

 Mumbai: Gutka baron Jagdish Joshi, who 

 has a non-bailable warrant against him in connection with 

 his alleged links with the underworld, arrived in India 

 on Thursday from Dubai, but his location could not be specified, 

 reports our special correspondent. 

 Bombay High Court has rejected his appeal to extend the stay on the warrant.

 Some reports suggested that Joshi was already in Mumbai and would appear before the CBI on Friday. 

 Joshi, however, surrendered his passport to the crime investigation department in Pune through a representative hours after landing in Delhi.

 The non-bailable warrant was issued by a special court against him for not appearing before it in the gutka case. 

 The names of Joshi, the owner of Goa Gutka, and Manikchand Gutka manufacturer Rasiklal Dhariwal came up in connection with extortion and smuggling of machinery by two alleged henchmen of Dawood Ibrahim, who were arrested in Mumbai.

 Joshi and Dhariwal, who were in Dubai from October 2004, failed to appear after several summons were issued to them for questioning in the case. They said they were required to stay abroad for a stipulated period to maintain their NRI status. 

 Dhariwal is still said to be in Dubai but has said he would appear before the CBI in March.

 Ansari: Aide held

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: A top Lashkar-e-Toiba militant, who had from Dubai masterminded the Sai Baba temple blast in Hyderabad three years ago, has been arrested in the capital.

 Abdul Razzak Masood, the chief co-ordinator of Lashkar activities in Dubai, was picked up in south Delhi yesterday, said deputy commissioner, special cell, Ajay Kumar.

 Delhi police officials said Razzak, who is from Andhra Pradesh, arrived in the country about a fortnight ago from Dubai, where he has been motivating people to take up militancy.

 Razzak was instrumental in the escape of Amir Reza Khan, the brother of Asif Reza Khan and a co-accused with Aftab Ansari in the attack on the American Center in Calcutta in January 2002.

 While Ansari was deported to India in February 2002, Amir contacted Razzak and sought his help to escape from Dubai.

 Razzak was involved in several high-profile militant attacks. From Dubai, he planned the Sai Baba temple scooter blast in Hyderabad in 2002. 

 He was declared a proclaimed offender in the case. One woman was killed in the explosion.

 The Lashkar militant also helped the three accused ? Imran, Abdul Bari and Muzzamil ? in the Ghatkopar blast of July 28, 2003, in Mumbai. He tried to help Imran escape to Pakistan by providing his own Pakistani passport. But the plan failed.

 Razzak was in regular contact with Muzzamil and Abdul Bari. 

 He was also in touch with Javed Sheikh, a key accused in the assassination attempt on Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi last year. Sheikh was later killed in a police encounter. 

 Razzak was also close to Hanif, an accused in the 2003 Gateway of India blast in Mumbai.

 Asked whether any links had been established between Razzak, who had returned from Uttar Pradesh, and the men who attacked the makeshift temple in Ayodhya recently, a top police officer said: We are not ruling out anything. We are questioning him to verify what his objective was in coming to Delhi.

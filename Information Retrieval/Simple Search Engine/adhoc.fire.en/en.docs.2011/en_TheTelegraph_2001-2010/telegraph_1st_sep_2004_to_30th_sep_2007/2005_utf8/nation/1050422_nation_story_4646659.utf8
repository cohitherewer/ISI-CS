 Uma picks Arjun role in BJP?s Mahabharat

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Amarkantak/Bhopal, April 21: Yesterday, she had invited an ?out of work? Atal Bihari Vajpayee to join her in tapasya. Today, Uma Bharti seemed keen to assume the role of principal dissident leader in the BJP.

 The sadhvi?s spiritual guru Vishveshwar Tirtha, who reached the temple town of Amarkantak today, set the tone by ruling out Uma?s ?sanyas? from politics.

 Tirtha, who hails from Udipi in Karnataka, arrived from Delhi. He had reportedly met some top RSS leaders in the capital. If the BJP circle in Madhya Pradesh is to be believed, Tirtha has secured the RSS?s backing before ?directing? the sadhvi to ?serve the nation?.

 Uma, hurt for being sidelined by the BJP brass, equated the ongoing power struggle in the party with the Mahabharat. The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said she was willing to play Arjun to take on the Bhishma pitamaha in the party, but was careful not to specify whom she intended to confront.

 Uma acknowledged that all was not well in the BJP, saying that some BJP leaders were maligning her image by giving ?off-the-record briefings?.

 Although she did not mention anyone specifically, it was clear that Uma?s accusing finger was pointed at virtually everyone in the top rung of the BJP central leadership.

 She said it was shocking that her party targeted her after she challenged Sonia Gandhi on grounds of foreign origin. ?I had thought the party would rally around me but I discovered that I was driven out of the BJP,? she said.

 ?I have been constantly labelled as one threatening the BJP government in the state. The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh is like my baby. I have undergone labour to deliver the state to the BJP. How can anyone think that could harm the government??

 Uma said that in her political career, spanning over 20 years, she has served the party with blood and sweat. ?It is my party and I will fight it to save it,? she said. ?Iske liye chahey mujhe apnno se larna pade (Even if I have to fight with party leaders for it),? she said.

 Yesterday, too, Uma took a dig at Advani when she said she was forced to retire at the age of 45.

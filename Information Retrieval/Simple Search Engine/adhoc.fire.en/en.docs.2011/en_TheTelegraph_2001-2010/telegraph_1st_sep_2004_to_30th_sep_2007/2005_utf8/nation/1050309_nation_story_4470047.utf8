 Banaras wins over Varanasi

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Varanasi, March 8: The din over Water has died down ? the holy city now echoes with strains from its musical past. 

 Director Pankaj Parashar attempts to explore the city?s tradition of classical music with Banaras, a film on the romance between a physics graduate and a music teacher.

 ?The city of Varanasi (the new name of Benaras) has been a subject of so many films. But Banaras will be the first on the continuing spirit of the city connecting the past and the present,? said Ratisankar Tripathi, the film?s production designer.

 Banaras Hindu University?s sprawling, leafy campus was abuzz with activity. It was chosen for the mahurat of the film and 200 unit workers had been busy recreating the locale as it was half a century ago. 

 ?This is the first time that 90 per cent of a film is being shot in Varanasi,? said Parashar.

 Apart from Ashmit Patel and Urmila Matondkar, who play the lead characters, the cast includes Raj Babbar and Dimple Kapadia. Vocalist Sanjeev Abhayankar is in charge of the music. 

 ?When Deepa Mehta?s Water sought to explore feminist issues like oppression of widows in the mutts by priests, it provoked the outrage of the orthodox. Filmmakers are now resorting to softer ways, avoiding controversy and going for easy escape into the past,? said Bandana Mishra, a student of journalism in Banaras Hindu University. 

 The shooting of Water was abandoned because of opposition from right-wing Hindu groups. Uttar Pradesh was then under BJP rule. 

 In December, Bubli aur Bunty, a mystery thriller starring Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee among others, was shot here. The shoot in the pilgrim town raised some eyebrows among Shiv Sena ranks, but this time, the shooting was not disrupted. 

 ?There is a difference between 2000 and 2005. Now we have a chief minister who has been promoting films, inviting film units from Mumbai to shoot and we are providing full security,? said principal home secretary Aloke Sinha. 

 The shooting of Banaras attracted a motley crowd of eminent citizens but the posse of policemen who stood guard underlined the director?s anxiety for the unpredictable. 

 A swimming pool had been created on the campus. Nearby was an old Shiva temple and a patch of green. As he sits by the poolside, Ashmit is suddenly inspired by the ambience and breaks into a song. When he stops, Urmila wonders: ?Itna achha gana kahan se sikkhe (Where did you learn to sing so well)?? 

 Varanasi has a tradition of ?guru-sishya parampara (legacy from the master to the disciple)?, which has contributed to the growth of classical music in the country. 

 Benaras gharana (tradition) is famed for its equal foothold in all three aspects of classical music ? instrumental, vocal and dance. 

 ?The uniqueness of the gharana is synonymous with the completeness of the city. Varanasi has a complete history of its own, being one of the oldest riverine cities of the world,? said Satish Chaturvedi, a Sanskrit scholar.

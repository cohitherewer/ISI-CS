 Uma deal on enemy radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 25: The Congress is banking on former BJP leader Uma Bharti for the leg-up it needs in Madhya Pradesh.

 State Congress sources said if Uma floats a party in the near future as she had declared, the Congress could consider having a tacit arrangement for the parliamentary and Assembly byelections.

 The Vidisha Lok Sabha seat was vacated by Shivraj Singh Chauhan after he became chief minister. Operation Duryodhan that exposed the cash-for-questions scandal claimed two other MPs ? Ram Sevak Singh of Gwalior and C.P. Singh of Sidhi.

 Another member from Mandala, F.S. Kulaste, was shown on television in the MP project funds scandal. A House report on him and six others who were shown taking or demanding money for sanctioning projects is awaited. 

 Of the four seats, three are held by the BJP, while Gwalior is in the Congress hands.

 Sources close to Uma said she might field her confidant, Prahlad Patel, from Vidisha. Patel, who lost to Kamal Nath in the last election from Chhindwara, left the BJP with Uma.

 The Congress sources said they are not averse to offering covert support to Patel by putting up a dummy candidate and getting Uma to back the partys nominees from Sidhi, Mandla and Gwalior. 

 Asked if the hard Hindutva line pursued by Uma might come as a deterrent, sources said Maharashtra had shown the way. 

 If the Congress can absorb hardcore Shiv Sainiks like Narayan Rane and Sanjay Nirupam, whats wrong with Uma? a Congress leader asked.

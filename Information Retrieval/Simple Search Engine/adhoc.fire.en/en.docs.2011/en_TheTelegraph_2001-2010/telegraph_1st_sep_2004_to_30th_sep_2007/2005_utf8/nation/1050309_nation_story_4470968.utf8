 Nepal 

 Kathmandu, March 8 (PTI): Kanak Mani Dixit, publisher and editor of Nepali fortnightly Himal, was released after a brief detention last night.

 Dixit was arrested from his house at 8 pm reportedly for criticising the emergency rule imposed by King Gyanendra.

 ?I was released at mid night after four hours of detention at Jawalakhel police station,? Dixit said. ?I don?t know the exact reason why I was detained,? he added. ?Probably the articles I had published in my magazine against the royal takeover prompted them to arrest me.?

 Dixit claimed that he was released early probably due to ?publicity and pressure?.

 No pinch of salt in this: non-iodised is out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 15: Non-iodised salt will no longer be sold in India.

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, who announced the decision today, said the ban had to be reinforced after a recent study showed iodine intake has gone down dramatically since the embargo was lifted by the previous regime in 2000.

 Lack of iodine leads to various complications, the most common being goitre. But what most people do not know is that iodine deficiency could lead to speech impediment, learning difficulties and is a major cause of anaemia in children and nursing mothers.

 Ramadoss said the study by the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences showed consumption of iodine had dropped from 49 per cent in 1998-99 to 37 per cent in 2002-03. 

 In states like Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal, consumption of iodised salt in households fell to just 5 per cent in 2002. Realising the consequences, the government decided to act fast.

 In all, 92 countries have banned sale of non-iodised salt.

 We are giving two months to manufacturers. The ban on non-iodised salt will be enforced from August 15 this year, Ramadoss said after a Unicef-government strategy review meeting on reproductive and child health was inaugurated this morning in the capital.

 The minister said a draft notification under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (PFA) had already been issued on May 27. The final notification will come three months later and the ban will be effective six months from today, health ministry officials said. They added that this much time will be needed to withdraw non-iodised salt from the market.

 India produces five million tonnes of iodised salt required for household consumption. Ramadoss said the cost of iodising salt is only 10 paise a person per year, so there will be no heavy burden on common consumers. Most of the salt produced in India comes from Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan.

 Earlier, the ban on non-iodised salt was lifted after the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, a Sangh parivar affiliate, championed the cause of the 8,000-odd workers in Gujarat who were involved in the production of non-iodised salt. The Manch lobbied BJP leaders, especially L.K. Advani who contests from Gujarat, to withdraw the ban.

 Ramadoss said the reinforcement of the ban would not hurt small producers as even crystallised salt could be iodised at a very nominal price.

 He also said the government would soon make fortification of salt with iron compulsory as anaemia, caused due to iron-deficiency, has emerged as a major killer among mothers and children.

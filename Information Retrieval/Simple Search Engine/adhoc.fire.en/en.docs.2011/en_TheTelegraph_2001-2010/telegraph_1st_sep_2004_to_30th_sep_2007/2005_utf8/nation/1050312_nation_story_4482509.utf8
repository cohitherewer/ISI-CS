 Friction over Bangla fence 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 11: Fencing along the Indo-Bangla border is fast turning into a contentious issue, with the Bangladesh Rifles and the Border Security Force having exchanged fire in Bengal?s Cooch Behar and south Tripura over the past few days.

 There are no casualties or injuries, but there are fears that relations between the two countries may be strained further if the situation is allowed to drift. 

 India says Bangladesh started the ?unprovoked? firing and has protested to Prime Minister Khaleda Zia through a ?note verbale? both in Delhi and in Dhaka.

 The deputy directors-general of the BSF and the Bangladesh Rifles have decided to hold a meeting in Agartala next week to defuse the situation. A more detailed discussion between them is planned for April.

 The controversy revolves around India fencing its porous border with Bangladesh. 

 Dhaka has argued that the fencing is in blatant violation of the 1975 agreement between the two nations, which prevents the construction of ?any defensive structure? along the border.

 Delhi has countered this by saying the fencing is not a ?defensive structure? and will help both countries stop ?criminal elements? from sneaking into each other?s territory taking advantage of the porous border.

 The trouble, according to Indian officials, started after the second phase of fencing began.

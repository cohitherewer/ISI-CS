 Sonia diktat under Toyota

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL AND GAJINDER SINGH

 New Delhi/Chandigarh, Oct. 

 6: Sonia Gandhi has just written to Congress chief ministers 

 to cut out all extravagance at government and party functions, 

 including free dinners and lunches. 

 This is how they are obeying the diktat:

 A fleet of swank new Toyota Camrys will ferry delegates at the two-day Congress chief ministers conclave beginning in Chandigarh tomorrow. The citys streets have been recarpeted for the occasion despite being in good condition.

 Lavish dinners and lunches are being thrown since yesterday for journalists, who have been put up at posh hotels at government expense by the co-hosts, Punjab and Haryana chief ministers Amarinder Singh and Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

 Sonias letter asks all party leaders ? including ministers and MLAs ? to keep even marriages and other private functions simple and unostentatious.

 It wants Congress-ruled states not to celebrate New Year and religious festivals or to print cards at government expense ? and try to avoid even foundation stone-laying ceremonies. Dinners and lunches at government or party functions, receptions and meetings are a no-no.

 In Chandigarh, though, hotels have been asked to import food items for the delegates. We have been asked to serve expensive dishes that we know many delegates will not eat because of the Navratri festival, a hotel official said.

 Over 60 senior officials from Punjab and Haryana are busy overseeing all the arrangements for the mega show.

 Amarinder ? whose government has bought the Toyota Camrys at a time when Punjabs farmers are furious because state agencies are not buying their paddy crop ? explained: We want to be good hosts.

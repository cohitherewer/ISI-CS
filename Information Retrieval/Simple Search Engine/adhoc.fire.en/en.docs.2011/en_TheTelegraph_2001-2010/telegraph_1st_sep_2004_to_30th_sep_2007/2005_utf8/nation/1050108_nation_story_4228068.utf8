 Caution call on adoption

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: Non-government organisations across the world have advised against hasty adoption of children orphaned by the tsunami.

 Many people have come forward with offers to provide a home for the children who find themselves alone after the calamity. But aid workers are advising families that want to adopt children to go slow to avoid complications in future. 

 ?In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, it is often difficult to ascertain that a child is truly an orphan,? said an aid worker.

 Aid workers said parents may have been separated from their children and may be staying in another refugee camp or just across the border. It is not ethical to place a child for adoption unless it is clear that no parent able to care for a child will be found.

 Ethical adoption practice requires that a child be considered ?legally abandoned? before being adopted by a family other than its own. The argument against hasty adoption rests on the ground that the governments of the tsunami-ravaged countries are in disarray. The courts and other institutions that handle adoptions may be in a shambles. 

 ?Adoption,? said an aid worker, ?cannot take place in such an environment.?

 The government today said efforts are underway to look for parents or extended family members of the children. ?The district magistrates are compiling lists of orphans. Efforts should be made to see that the child is not traumatised any further,? said Naveen Chawla, a secretary in the information and broadcasting ministry.

 Sri Lanka, one of the worst-affected countries with 42,000 dead, has banned adoptions for the time being. There is widespread apprehension that gangs of traffickers are on the lookout for vulnerable children.

 In such a situation, governments and NGOs believe, it is better to wait till they are sure about the status of the families of the children. The search for family members may take months in the aftermath of a disaster. 

 According to aid workers, the first priority is to treat the children?s post-traumatic stress disorders. Adoption by families from foreign countries may not be in their best interest now.

 Adoption guidelines differ from country to country. In Indonesia, couples wishing to adopt have to be residents of the country for at least two years. Sri Lanka does not allow a single parent to adopt. In Malaysia, adoptions are not common and non-Muslims are not allowed to adopt Muslim children.

 Indian law has no provision for foreigners to adopt children from the country but, under the Guardian and Wards Act, foreigners may petition an Indian district court for legal custody of a child to be taken abroad for adoption. Non-Indians are required to work through a licensed Indian adoption agency following a Supreme Court decision in 1984.

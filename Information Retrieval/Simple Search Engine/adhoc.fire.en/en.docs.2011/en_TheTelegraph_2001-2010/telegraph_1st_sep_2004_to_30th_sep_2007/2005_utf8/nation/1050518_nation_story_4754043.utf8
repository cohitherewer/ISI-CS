 Big cat bombshell in court

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: Grim statistics have been revealed days before the Prime Minister hits the tiger trail at Ranthambore: 411 of the big cats have disappeared from Indian forests in five years.

 As many as 352 of the tigers that went missing from 1999 to 2003 had fallen prey to poachers, the Centre has informed the Supreme Court.

 Manmohan Singh is to visit Ranthambore National Park on May 23, where a tiger census is underway. He was to have earlier gone to Sariska National Park, all of whose tigers have vanished according to a census in March that rang the alarm bells. The Prime Minister had ordered a CBI probe in March following reports of poaching at Sariska. Both parks are in Rajasthan. 

 An independent agency was commissioned to compile and analyse the available country-level tiger poaching data over a period of five years (1999 to 2003). The data collected records of 411 cases during the five years out of which 173 records relate to mortality and 238 records relate to seizures, the ministry of environment and forests said in its affidavit to the apex court. Only 59 tigers died of natural causes.

 The affidavit was filed in response to a public interest litigation by environmentalist Ashok Kumar, who is seeking a CBI probe in all tiger reserves in the country. 

 Madhya Pradesh had the highest number of seizures of tiger skins and body parts (57), followed by Uttar Pradesh (44), West Bengal (39), Maharashtra (19), Uttaranchal (15) and Andhra Pradesh (11), the affidavit said.

 Poachers are most active in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra accounting for the killing of 24 and 23 tigers, respectively, in the last five years, it added. Thirteen tigers were found killed in Madhya Pradesh.

 But while the CBI had reported a nil tiger count at Sariska ? suggesting that about 16-18 had gone missing since last summer ? the ministry said only two tigers were killed by poachers in the five-year period.

 The affidavit has given an international twist to the poaching problem, saying: The international border of India with Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar is relatively porous, which facilitates illegal transfer of contraband, including wildlife items, across these borders.

 It said the Project Tiger steering committee has recommended putting several tiger reserves across the country on the poaching watch list. 

 The PIL will be taken up for further hearing in July, after the apex courts summer vacation.

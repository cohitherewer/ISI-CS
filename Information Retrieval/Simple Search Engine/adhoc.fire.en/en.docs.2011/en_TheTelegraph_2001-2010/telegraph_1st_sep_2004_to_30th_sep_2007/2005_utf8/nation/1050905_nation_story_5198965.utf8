 Prayers by day, sleepless at night

 Hyderabad, Sept. 4: This 

 Sunday afternoon, Sania Mirza took Hyderabads mind 

 off the usual mutton biryani and matinee show.

 Instead, the city of 60 lakh seemed to make a beeline for temples, mosques and churches to pray for the city girls success at New York in the small hours of Monday.

 At the local sports clubs and shopping malls, at biryani joints and Irani tea shops, the only talking point seemed to be the teenage sensation who has risen to a world rating of 42 from 169 in eight months.

 The mania didnt spare archbishops and temple priests. It is yet another Hyderabadi who will create history once again, said the Archbishop of Hyderabad, Marampudi Joji.

 The tennis star figured in Sunday services at all the major churches, as she did in temple and mosque rituals.

 We too prayed for Sanias success, said priest Soundarajan of the Ganesh temple at Chilkur, about 30 km from Hyderabad.

 Most elite city clubs ? the Secunderabad Club, Nizams Club and Gymkhana ? made arrangements for members to watch the match late at night, and decided to keep their bars open.

 Sports and social clubs all over the state capital and other cities, such as Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam, announced they would keep their doors open for anyone looking to watch Sanias mouth-watering clash against Russian world number two Maria Sharapova on mega screens.

 We have made special arrangements to accommodate crowds at our sports clubs all over the state to watch the match, said M.S. Thakur, the chairperson of the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh.

 Malls such as Hyderabad Central, Shoppers Stop and Lifestyle put up blow-ups of the tennis star, with an eye on attracting the young crowd.

 On Sunday morning, sports officials held small rallies in stadiums with the handfuls of sportspersons who had gathered for their regular workouts.

 We dont want to appear tepid about the match though it is scheduled late at night, a sports official said. Sports minister M.S. Satyanarayana Rao said he would stay up to watch the match.

 Some industrialists and enthusiastic shopkeepers distributed sweets in advance and fed the poor.

 Sania is the mascot of Hyderabad. She has changed our lifestyle. Even my granddaughters and nieces have now taken to tennis, said industrialist G.V. Krishna Reddy.

 Vernacular publications have been full of Sania and her exploits for the past two days. After all, its not every day that a Hyderabadi scales such heights, explained Ashok Tankasala, editor of Vaartha.

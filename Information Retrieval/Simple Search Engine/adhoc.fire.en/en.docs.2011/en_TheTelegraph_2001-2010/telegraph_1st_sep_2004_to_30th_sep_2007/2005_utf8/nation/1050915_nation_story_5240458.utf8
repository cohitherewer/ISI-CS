 New Delhi: Two young women who had gone 

 to watch a movie in east Delhis PVR cinema hall on 

 Tuesday night were allegedly molested by five men when they 

 went to the ladies room during the interval, reports 

 our correspondent.

 Their three male relatives were in the auditorium when the incident, recorded on closed-circuit television, took place. One of the women is married while the other is her unmarried sister-in-law. Police arrested one of the accused, Mandeep, after a complaint was registered.

 Kamal Chaudhry, a relative of the women, alleged: 

 The police were trying to pressure us not to file 

 a complaint but it is because of the CCTV that they were 

 forced to take action. A spokesperson for the cinema 

 said action was taken as soon as the incident was brought 

 to the authorities notice.

 Sena opposes fine for bandh

 Ghatkopar blasts two years ago.

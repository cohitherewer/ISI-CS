 Nuclear pact 

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: Indias collaboration in the civilian nuclear sector with the US will not compromise security interests despite risks, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in the Rajya Sabha today.

 If there are risks, those are calculated risks worth taking, he said.

 Singh said before leaving, he had discussed his agenda with A.B. Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh.

 Information right bill tabled

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 10: The government today moved the right to information bill in the Lok Sabha but the budget session looked headed to end without clearing the national employment guarantee bill and the tribal land amendment bill.

 The information bill, which has been on the priority list of the national advisory council, makes it obligatory for a public information officer to provide a person the data he asks for within 30 days. 

 In a situation concerning the ?life or liberty? of a person, the information has to be furnished within 48 hours. A person can seek information without giving reasons.

 The bill states that an officer who fails to provide the information or gives out incorrect information will be fined Rs 250 for each day of delay and the amount may go up to Rs 25,000. The onus of proving innocence lies on the officer.

 Those below the poverty line will get the information they require without paying a fee. Others will have to pay a ?reasonable? amount.

 The Left parties focused more on the employment guarantee bill and the tribal land rights bill as their priorities. Neither may be passed in this session of Parliament.

 The national employment guarantee bill is pending before the parliamentary standing committee headed by BJP MP Kalyan Singh. The Congress and the Left are accusing Singh of stalling the act by deliberately putting off committee meetings.

 Notice to CID in Yunus case

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, March 11: The Khwaja Yunus custodial death case took a dramatic turn today with a special court issuing a show cause notice to the state Criminal Investigation Department asking it why it did not invoke the anti-terror law against four arrested crime branch officials.

 Designated judge A.P. Bhangale today directed the state CID to file its reply by March 14. The CID had arrested the four officers of the Ghatkopar crime intelligence unit under Section 302 (murder) and Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code.

 Judge Bhangale issued the notice on a plea by Yunus?s co-accused in the Ghatkopar bomb blasts case, Abdul Mateen Basit. In his application, Mateen Basit requested the court that since it was hearing the December 2, 2002, Ghatkopar blasts case in which Yunus was an accused, the four arrested police officials should be produced before it.

 Bombay High Court had in April 2004 directed the CID to reinvestigate Yunus?s alleged custodial death based on Mateen Basit?s eyewitness account. 

 Mateen Basit, currently lodged in Thane jail in another case, had told the court that he had seen 26-year-old chemical engineer Khwaja Yunus vomiting blood after police torture in the lock-up at the Ghatkopar crime intelligence unit on January 6, 2003. The police had earlier claimed that Yunus had escaped while being escorted by a police party in Ahmednagar on January 7, 2003.

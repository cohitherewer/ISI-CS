 Missile muscle parade for US eyes

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: India?s military establishment today test-fired an anti-missile missile, signalling to the US that it was willing to play hardball while bargaining for an advanced missile defence system.

 A team from Washington is currently in New Delhi and will give the defence establishment a two-day briefing beginning tomorrow on the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC)-II system. New Delhi is keener on the Patriot III missile defence system that was used to defend Kuwait successfully in the 2003 war on Iraq.

 ?The Security Cooperation Group will give a presentation on missile defence. This or earlier meetings and demonstrations is no indicator. What suits you or what does not suit you is your choice,? defence secretary Ajai Vikram Singh said. 

 Indian military officials have attended missile defence demonstrations in the US in the last two years.

 The scientific adviser to the defence minister and head of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), M. Natarajan, said an Akash surface to air missile test-fired from a mobile launcher at Chandipur in the Orissa coast ?met all technical parameters?. ?I expect the Akash missile to go for user-trials by the end of this year,? Natarajan said.

 The Akash, one of the systems being tried under India?s Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, has been in the works for more than eight years. It was initially designed as an anti-aircraft missile but was being re-configured as an anti-missile missile.

 It is said to have a range of about 27 km and can carry a 50kg warhead. In the test around 1 pm this afternoon DRDO sources said the missile hit a target towed by a pilotless target aircraft called the Lakshya. The Akash is used with a Rajendra radar and is being designed to engage multiple targets simultaneously.

 India?s security establishment has concluded that a missile defence system is necessary because of the ?no-first-use? nuclear doctrine adopted by it. This means that in the event of an attack with nuclear weapons by an adversary, India has to arm defences of its own nuclear capabilities. India?s choice of a missile defence system will be determined by efficiency of targeting and reaction time in seconds. 

 The briefing by US officials tomorrow and the day after will be given by a team led by Edward Ross of the Pentagon?s Defence Security Cooperation Agency. Ross leads the US security cooperation group that holds periodic dialogue on military-to-military ties with India. US embassy sources said tomorrow?s meeting flows from the agreement on Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) signed between New Delhi and Washington last year.

 Under phase 1 of the NSSP, Washington had agreed that it will give New Delhi a ?strategic briefing? on the PAC-II. Indian military officials have in the past attended at least two missile defence demonstrations in the US.

 But Indian defence officials said that the ?technical presentation? was no indicator that India had committed to procure the PAC-II, a system developed by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. The Patriot-II was partly successful in the 1991 Gulf War and was used to defend Israel from attacks by outdated Scud missiles fired by Saddam Hussein?s regime. In 2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Patriot III was performed more efficiently, bringing down tens of Iraqi Scud missiles aimed at Kuwait.

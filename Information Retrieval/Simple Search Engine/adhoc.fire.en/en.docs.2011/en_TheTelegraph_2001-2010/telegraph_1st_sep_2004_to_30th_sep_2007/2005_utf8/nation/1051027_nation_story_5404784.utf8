 Blast stalls relief traffic

 MUKHTAR AHMAD 

 Srinagar, Oct. 26: A car bomb blast on the strategic Srinagar-Uri National Highway has claimed a Border Security Force trooper and brought movement of relief convoys to quake-hit north Kashmir towns to a standstill. 

 Police said an explosives-packed car, parked on the highway, blew up this afternoon when a BSF convoy reached the spot at Omerabad, 12 km from here. Senior paramilitary and police officers rushed to the spot immediately. 

 The Hizb-ul Mujahideen has owned responsibility for the attack.

 Security forces have cordoned off the area for searches, bringing to a halt the traffic on the highway being used by relief convoys to reach places like Uri and Tangdhar. 

 One critically injured BSF soldier succumbed in hospital while six civilians and 22 BSF troopers sustained injuries in the attack, Javed Ahmad Mukhdoomi, the inspector-general of Kashmir police said.

 The police said the heavily-escorted convoy was on its way to Baramulla in north Kashmir. 

 Witnesses said shopkeepers in the area downed shutters in panic and rushed for cover after the blast. The ill-fated BSF bus was completely destroyed. 

 A resident said: The impact of the explosion resembled the recent massive earthquake. All windowpanes were shattered.

 It was a deafening explosion. Windowpanes of my house were smashed by the impact of the blast, said Abdul Rashid, another resident.

 Last week, militants gunned down Ghulam Nabi Lone, the Jammu and Kashmir minister of state for education, in the high-security area of Tulsi Bagh in Srinagar.

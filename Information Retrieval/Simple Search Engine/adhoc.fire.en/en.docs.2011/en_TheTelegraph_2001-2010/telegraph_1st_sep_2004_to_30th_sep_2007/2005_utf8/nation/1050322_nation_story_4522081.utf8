 Kabul health plea

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 21: Afghanistan wants India to lend it a hand to revive its health services.

 Afghan health minister Sayeed Mohammad Amin Fatemi today met his Indian counterpart Anbumani Ramadoss to discuss ways in which Delhi could help Kabul bring affordable healthcare to its citizens.

 Fatemi said he wanted the 200-bed Indira Gandhi Children?s Hospital in Kabul to be closely associated with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The Afghan minister said he was keen to have specialists from AIIMS working in Kabul on five-year deputations, as was the practice in the early nineties. Afghan doctors could also be given specialised training at AIIMS, he said.

 The first phase of the Indira Gandhi hospital in Kabul was begun in the late sixties and completed in the eighties. The second phase was delayed because of civil war and work on the hospital, built entirely with Indian grants, was revived in 2003.

 Crush drives boy to kill

 Dhanbad, June 20: A 14-year-old boy today murdered a 65-year-old man and a child, claiming before the police that irrational fear of a thrashing and love for a 12-year-old girl drove him to kill.

 Ajay Swarnakar, a student of Class IX, had left his cap, the knife and one of the blood-stained gloves at the place of occurrence, his clothes in the school a short distance away and the other glove below his study-table at home. 

 It was a cake-walk for the sniffer dogs and the police picked up the boy by 1 pm from Topchanchi, where he had taken shelter in a relatives house, less than 12 hours after he turned a killer.

 The bright boy next door had grown up with the two daughters of Forward Bloc MLA from Nirsa Aparna Sengupta and claimed to have developed a crush for the younger daughter, Lipi. 

 The elder daughter, he said, had learnt recently of the romance and threatened to alert her mother. She also discussed it with the domestic help, Shivani Ghosh. The mother was away in Ranchi, attending the Assembly session. 

 Deciding to kill everyone so that he could elope with the younger daughter, the teenager hid himself under the bed in the modest, two-roomed Sengupta household on Sunday night. It was easy because he had free access to the house and was considered a part of the family. Ajay would often walk across to lend a helping hand or to run errands.

 He used a sharp knife, used to sacrifice goats, to kill Satya Sengupta (65), the legislators uncle-in-law, who was asleep in one of the rooms. He then went up to the mezzanine floor and killed Santu (8), son of Shivani (35) before attacking the latter. She possibly woke up and tried to raise an alarm. 

 The sisters were asleep in another room on the ground floor, and the elder of the two woke up on hearing the commotion. There was a scuffle and Ajay pulled at her hair and hit her repeatedly with a screw-driver. Lipi, however, appears to have persuaded him to let the elder girl alone and leave the house.

 In the police lock-up, Ajay claimed that Lipi was horrified and exclaimed how he could have committed the crime. I wanted to end my life then but Lipi handed over the keys to the main gate and urged me to escape, he said.

 The sensational murder has put a question mark on the role of the five house-guards posted at the MLAs house.

 A shocked Sengupta claimed that she had complained to the SP about the casual house-guards and had demanded their replacement. Her request, she said, was not heeded. 

 The guards were placed under suspension and finally withdrawn today.

 The MLA, whose son studies in a school in Ranchi, also did not lose the opportunity of accusing her political rivals, notably the Marxist Coordination Committees leaders, of instigating the teenager to commit the crime. Senguptas husband was killed in 2002.

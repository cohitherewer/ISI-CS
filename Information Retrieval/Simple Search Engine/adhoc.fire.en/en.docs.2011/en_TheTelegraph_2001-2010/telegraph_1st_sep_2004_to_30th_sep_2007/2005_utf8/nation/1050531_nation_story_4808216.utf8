 Assembly dissolution appeal 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 30: A public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court today challenging the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly.

 The PIL filed by Shiv Kumar Prasad Singh, who unsuccessfully contested the last Bihar Assembly elections, claimed that he was a politically enlightened citizen of India and a voter in the state of Bihar and, therefore, had a locus standi to file the plea.

 The petition, filed under Article 32 of the Constitution alleging violation of fundamental rights, sought quashing of the Union home ministrys May 23 notification dissolving the Assembly in Bihar and a stay on the election process in the state till the Supreme Court decides the case.

 The petitioners counsel, R.D. Upadhyay, contended that the recommendation by governor Buta Singh to dissolve the Assembly was unconstitutional, not bona fide and meant to frustrate (the) mandate of the electorate.

 The PIL said the governor should have waited for some more time for the formation of a legitimate government in the state as it was already under Presidents rule.

 The petition accused the governor of acting on the basis of baseless reports about horse-trading of newly-elected MLAs. It said the governor should have proceeded against those indulging in horse-trading if he had solid evidence.

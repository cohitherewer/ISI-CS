 Natwar bid to remove Italy bar

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, June 20: India is now trying to get Italy to agree that it will not stand in the way of Delhis efforts to enter the UN Security Council as a permanent member. 

 External affairs minister K. Natwar Singh today held wide-ranging discussions with the Italian leadership in Rome, particularly on the proposed UN expansion.

 Italy heads the coffee club or the group of nations that is opposed to more permanent members in the UN. This camp is in favour of regional representation on a rotational basis with each country getting a four-year term in the Security Council.

 Apart from Italy, the other key member in the coffee club is Pakistan. 

 While Italy is against Germany getting a permanent seat, Pakistans attempt is to block India. Both nations are opposed to the Group of Four, comprising India, Germany, Brazil and Japan.

 Singh will try to impress upon the leaders in Rome that Italy has more to lose by aligning with Pakistan in opposing Indias UN bid. 

 The foreign ministers meeting with Italian leaders is of significance as on June 22 Natwar will be in Brussels to attend the emergency meeting of G4 foreign ministers. 

 The meeting was called after the US made clear its intention to support Japan and one more country in the proposed expansion of the Security Council. India is being seen as the possible second country. But the US move, most nations believe, is as an attempt to split the G4.

 Doubts are being raised on whether Germany and Brazil will be able to make it to the expanded council. There is opposition on making the UN too Europe-centric by allowing Germany in ? the UK, France and Russia are already in the permanent five. 

 Also some of Americas key allies, like Mexico and Argentina, are strongly opposed to Brazil making it to the high table.

 The head of US state departments policy planning, Stephen Krasmer, is here and in the next few days will hold talks with Indian officials on how the two sides could strengthen ties. 

 Later in the week, the US under-secretary for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, is due to arrive for talks with key South Block officials on the UN expansion.

 The visits of the US officials are of importance as they will play an important role in firming up the programme of the Prime Ministers proposed visit to Washington next month. The visiting officials will also clarify the position of the Bush administration on whether India fulfils the criteria set by the US for supporting new members.

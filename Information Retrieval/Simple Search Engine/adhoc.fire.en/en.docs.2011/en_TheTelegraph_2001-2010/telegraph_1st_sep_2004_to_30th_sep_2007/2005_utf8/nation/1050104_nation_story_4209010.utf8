 Another Zahira denial

 Zahira: Sign twist

 New Delhi, Jan. 3 (PTI): Zahira Sheikh today told the Supreme Court that no affidavit sworn by her was ever filed in the court, based on which the Best Bakery trial was shifted from Gujarat to Mumbai and the acquittal of 21 accused quashed.

 The bakery witness? latest affidavit came in response to an apex court notice on an application filed by Teesta Setalvad, a social activist whom Zahira has accused of pressuring her to implicate innocent people in the case.

 In her application to the Supreme Court, Setalvad sought a CBI probe into Zahira?s frequent flip-flops.

 The apex court, taking cognisance of Setalvad?s application, had issued notices to Zahira and the Gujarat government on December 6. The bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and H.K. Sema wanted to know if Zahira?s latest statement in favour of the accused did not amount to filing a false affidavit and hence be seen as a contempt of court.

 In retaliation through counsel D.K. Garg, Zahira today just stopped short of accusing Setalvad of filing a forged affidavit on her behalf. 

 ?All these matters contain an affidavit supposed to have been filed by me in September 2003. I do not recall having made any such affidavit because this one ?compulsive document?, which is found in every writ or application or appeal does not contain any evidence of my having sworn it as it does not bear my signature, nor is there any sign of having been sworn to or affirmed before any authority competent to administer oath,? the affidavit said. 

 Zahira termed the so-called affidavits filed on her behalf and another in her sister?s name by Setalvad?s NGO as ?leaflets?, as they had no official authentication on it.

 ?Surprisingly, also annexed with this affidavit is another so-called affidavit dated August 2003, supposed to have been filed by my sister Saira Banu, and this so called affidavit is neither addressed to any court nor to any authority, nor does it bear the signatures of any authority or person who is competent to administer oath. These two documents appear to be leaflets, distributed for free,? she said.

 Zahira termed the Tehelka sting operation ? which pointed fingers at BJP MLA Bablu Srivastava for allegedly bribing her to change her statement ? as ?blatant falsehood?. 

 The witness said Setalvad had ?incited so much hatred against me that the Muslim Tyohar Committee? issued a fatwa, excommunicating me.? She reiterated her allegation that ?Setalvad and her agents? had pressured her in the name of ?religion? to falsely implicate persons in the case.

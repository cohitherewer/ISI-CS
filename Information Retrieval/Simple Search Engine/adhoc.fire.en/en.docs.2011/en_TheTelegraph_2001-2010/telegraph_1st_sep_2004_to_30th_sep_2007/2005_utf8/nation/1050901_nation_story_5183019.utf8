 Left talks reform, PM waits for walk

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: Despite 

 the recent pro-reform statements by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee 

 and Prakash Karat, the Prime Minister prefers to wait and 

 watch.

 After his successful trip to Southeast Asia, the Bengal chief minister has coined a slogan: Reform, perform or perish. Now, party general secretary and hardliner Karat has endorsed this, saying: We (the CPM) are not dogmatic. With time, our party has changed its stand on various issues. We are open to change and have changed.

 But Manmohan Singh isnt ready to see this as the green light to pursue his largely stalled liberalisation agenda. He will watch how these sentiments expressed by the Left leaders play out in the weeks to come, sources said.

 At his one-to-one with Bhattacharjee this evening, the Prime Minister tried to get a clear understanding of the CPMs mind. Depending on this, a meeting of the United Progressive Alliance-Left co-ordination committee ? which the CPM and CPI have stopped attending in protest against the proposed Bhel divestment ? may be called.

 A senior CPM leader confirmed the party will come on board once the government publicly announces that it has put the Bhel issue on the backburner and will not touch the other navratna PSUs.

 Among the sticking points between the government and the Left are FDI in the retail sector, liberalisation in the financial/banking sector and FDI in insurance (see chart). Labour law reform is another contentious issue, with government sources saying this is a must to attract greater investment in special export zones. 

 Also, the textile industry has not kept pace with the global scene because of Indias inflexible labour laws. Pakistan and Bangladesh are competing better because theirs are flexible, a source said.

 The Prime Minister has repeatedly stressed in his public addresses that to reach the eight per cent growth rate, investments have to go up by 32 per cent compared with the current rate of 28 per cent.

 Singh is also worried that infrastructure ? whether its power, roads, railways, ports or coal ? has hit a roadblock because FDI was not coming at the expected pace. Airport construction is behind schedule, a source said.

 On FDI in retail, the governments argument, articulated by a source, has been: It is one of the high-investment areas, and the US is keen on it. Investments in retail have had a huge impact on China.

 This is what the Prime Minister explained to Bhattacharjee. Retail investments do not mean the neighbourhood grocer will become extinct. It means more and more Indian goods can be outsourced; (that) Wall-Mart will take Indian goods to other countries. Bhattacharjee understood the argument but was non-committal. Let us see how his party ideologues receive it. 

 Realising how nuanced the equation with the Left is, Singh is keen to avoid being seen as intervening in its internal debate on economic reforms.

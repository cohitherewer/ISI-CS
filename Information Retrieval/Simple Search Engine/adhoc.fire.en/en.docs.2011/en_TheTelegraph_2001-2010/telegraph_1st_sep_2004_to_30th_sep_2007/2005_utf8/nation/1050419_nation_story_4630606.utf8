 Call for tobacco pictorial warning 

 Jaipur (PTI): The Indian Asthma Care 

 Society has demanded that packets of cigarettes and other 

 tobacco product should have a pictorial depiction of a ?skull 

 and cross bones? to make consumers aware of the ill effects 

 on their health.

 The society?s secretary, Dharam Veer Kateva, in a letter to Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, said as the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products (prohibition of advertisement and regulation of trade, commerce, production, supply and distribution) Act, 2003 was in force in the state, it was mandatory for manufacturers to print a pictorial warning.

 Besides a picture, every cigarette packet must also indicate the nicotine and tar contents, he said. The act provides for seizure and confiscation of packets that do not contain such warning, Kateva added.

 Satellite rescue system 

 New Delhi (PTI): The country?s satellite-based 

 search and rescue system detected and supported two distress 

 calls that led to the rescue of 25 people, said the annual 

 report of the space department.

 Wage jab at rural job bill 

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The rural job bill, set to be passed by Parliament in days, allows workers to be underpaid, members of a think-tank headed by Sonia Gandhi said today.

 National Advisory Council members Jean Dreze and Aruna Roy cited another flaw: a clause that permits the Centre to stop the funds for a project if it is satisfied prima facie (on the face of it) that the money is being misused.

 This means two things, the council members say. One, workers will not report corruption for fear of losing their livelihood. Two, the Centre gets an easy excuse to hold back funds.

 The objections have been raised just two days after council chief Sonia Gandhis forceful defence of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill in the Lok Sabha. The bill, one of Sonias pet projects, guarantees work for at least 100 days to one member of every rural household.

 Dreze and Roy have targeted the amendments made to the bill, which was tabled in its original form in December 2004. Dreze, an economist, said clause 6 of the current bill allows a worker to be paid less than the minimum wage fixed for his state.

 Clause 6 says: Notwithstanding anything contained in the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the wage rate for purpose of the clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 22 shall be sixty rupees.

 This means workers will be paid Rs 60 a day under the scheme everywhere in the country, though the statutory minimum wage is much higher in many states, Dreze said, and though the Supreme Court has ruled that paying a worker less than the minimum wage violates one of his fundamental rights.

 The apex court had, in Sanjit Roy versus the state of Rajasthan, said: Every person who provides labour or service to another is entitled at least to the minimum wage and if anything less than the minimum wage is paid to him, he can complain of violation of his fundamental right under Article 23 and ask the court to direct payment of the minimum wage to him so that the breach of Article may be abated.

 Former Prime Minister V.P. Singh, too, has objected to clause 6. The Left MPs, however, have been silent on this, with CPM general secretary Prakash Karat saying he had not read the text of the bill and so could not comment.

 Dreze said the initial draft of the bill prepared by the National Advisory Council had laid down that a labourer cannot be paid less than the statutory minimum wage applicable to his or her state.

 Dreze and Roy have the support of the Peoples Action for Employment Guarantee, a forum of intellectuals.

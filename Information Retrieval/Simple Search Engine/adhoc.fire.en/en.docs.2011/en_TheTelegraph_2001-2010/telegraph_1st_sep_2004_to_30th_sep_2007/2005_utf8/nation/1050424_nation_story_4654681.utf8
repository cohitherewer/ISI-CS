 Pak salute to Inzy?s boys

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, April 23: Thousands of cricket fans will gather in front of the Pakistan Parliament tomorrow to honour Inzy?s boys for their ?historic success? in the friendship series in India.

 Pakistan Television has organised a daylong reception for the cricket team, appropriately titled Hai Koi Hum Jaisa, which will end with an awards ceremony at the Convention Centre at night.

 The programme was unveiled at a news conference today by information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad.

 While PTV will begin its special transmission at 9 am local time, the cricket stars will arrive in the Blue area ? Islamabad?s main commercial boulevard ? at 3.00 in the afternoon.

 Escorted by a cavalcade of motorcyclists, sport cars and members of leading music groups, the cricketers will be ferried to Parliament House in specially decorated buses where Ahmad and other legislators will receive them.

 PTV will air special programmes in which Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, Pakistan Cricket board chairman Shahryar Khan and top entertainment stars will participate.

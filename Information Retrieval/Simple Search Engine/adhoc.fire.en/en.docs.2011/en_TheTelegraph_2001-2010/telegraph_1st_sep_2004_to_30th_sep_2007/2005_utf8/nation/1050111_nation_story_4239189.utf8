 Bangalore, Jan. 10: Fifty-seven passengers drowned in the Almatti dam canal in Bijapur early on Monday because of inept driving by a conductor of a state-run bus.

 The conductor, Siddappa Sharanappa Pujar, was at the wheel when the accident occurred near Nidungundi, 60 km from Bijapur and 530 km from Bangalore. The victims included 18 women and two children.

 Pujar lost control while negotiating a hairpin bend along the canal and drove the bus through the culvert into the swirling waters. He was among the seven passengers who survived. 

 Pujar has been charged with negligent driving, Bijapur superintendent of police S.K. Singh said.

 The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation bus was operating between Hubli and Chitapur in Gulbarga.

 This evening, bodies of all the victims were recovered from the canal. Police and fire brigade personnel deployed four cranes to hoist the mangled bus out of the 15-foot-deep canal before retrieving the bodies that got entangled inside the bus.

 ?Most of the victims were asleep when the accident took place. One of the survivors told us that the conductor was at the wheel and the driver was asleep at the rear of the bus,? Singh said.

 Among the victims were seven members of a family bound for Jewargi in Gulbarga district, the home constituency of chief minister Dharam Singh.

 The magnitude of the accident prompted a visit by Dharam Singh and transport minister Mallikarjun Kharge. While the chief minister instructed the district administration to initiate steps for the prevention of such accidents along the canal, Kharge announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the next of kin of those who died in the accident.

 The dam, built across the Krishna, has earlier figured in riparian disputes between Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The state government completed the construction of the dam in the late nineties to irrigate the parched tracts of north Karnataka and provide drinking water to Gulbarga and Bijapur cities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 NDA bent on boycott

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 4: The NDA has decided to boycott the rest of the budget session and rejected a fresh appeal issued by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee asking the Opposition to reconsider its decision. 

 The ostensible reasons were an alleged demand by Congress general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Ambika Soni for an ?apology? from the NDA for its conduct in and outside Parliament and a statement by the Prime Minister?s media adviser that Manmohan Singh will not urge the Opposition to return to the House. 

 The NDA declared the decision was irrevocable.

 But cracks were visible in the Opposition, with the Telugu Desam Party ? which is an ?outside? constituent ? indicating that its MPs may withdraw their support from the boycott and come back to the House tomorrow. 

 The Desam parliamentary party is meeting in the morning to take a decision. Its leader Yerran Naidu said: ?It depends on my party high command?s decision.? 

 While Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu was initially persuaded by the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, L.K. Advani, to be part of the boycott, sources said the MPs were under pressure from their constituents to function like ?bona fide elected representatives? and not be absent from the House. 

 ?You ask any MP elected by the people. They have to go to Parliament, they have to discuss people?s problems. Not only for the TDP, but for any political party,? Naidu said. 

 After a meeting this morning, which was chaired by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA released a statement which said: ?After considering the issue of boycott in detail, NDA leaders have unanimously come to the conclusion that in view of the government?s undemocratic and intemperate attitude towards the Opposition and its complete disregard of all parliamentary norms and standards, the NDA has no alternative except to boycott the rest of the session.?

 Left battle shifts to banking 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Calcutta, Feb. 15: Banking has become the new battleground between the Left and the finance minister.

 The Left parties have sent a note to Sonia Gandhi, objecting to a proposal to raise the cap on foreign investment in banking. They are also worried over reports that the ceiling on foreign investors? voting rights might be raised. 

 Earlier this week, finance minister P. Chidambaram signalled to CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan the government?s plan to go ahead with the proposed hike in foreign direct investment in banking. 

 The Left parties had given a note of dissent on telecom, too, but the government went ahead with its plan and raised the FDI cap in the sector. 

 Chidambaram has argued that the previous A.B. Vajpayee regime issued a notification on March 5, 2003, increasing the scope for foreign investments in private banks to 74 per cent from 49 per cent. His government is implementing the notification, which cannot be scrapped. 

 In the latest note, also submitted to the government, the Left has asked the Centre not to adopt the ?notification route? to facilitate acquisition of shares by foreign banks. 

 The other issue of contention is the limit on voting rights of foreign investors. The RBI has put a 10 per cent cap on their voting rights. It means the foreign buyers cannot take over the private bank they have invested in. 

 But the Left feels that the RBI is about to raise the voting limit.

 The removal of the cap on voting rights will require an amendment of Section 12 (2) of the Banking Regulation Act. The Left parties have stated that they will oppose the amendment if it is tabled in Parliament.

 ?Initially, RBI was lukewarm to the proposal, but it seems that the apex bank has changed its stand. If RBI issues the guidelines before the budget, we apprehend that the bank regulation amendment act will be moved during the budget session. We will vote against it,? said a CPM source. 

 ?We do not have problems if FDI flows into the banking sector under the current regulatory framework,? said the source.

 The Left is banking on the fact that every time the government wants to raise the cap on voting rights of foreign buyers, it will have to move amendments to the regulation act. It will be virtually impossible for the government to push through any amendment if the BJP and the Left oppose it. 

 The main Opposition party, the BJP, is likely to resist such an amendment. 

 The Left bank employees? federations have threatened a daylong national strike in March. The CPM and the CPI have left it to the unions to stage a protest outside Parliament during the budget session while the parties will raise the issue inside.

 Party to govern govt 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Sept. 9: The Madhya Pradesh government, which recently lifted the ban on trishuls, has decided to appoint in-house advisers from the ruling party for all departments and ministries.

 The move to induct BJP cadre and Sangh pracharaks ? the brainchild of state BJP chief Shivraj Singh Chauhan ? is ostensibly meant to bridge the gulf between the party and the government. 

 But the state bureaucracy fears interference in the day-to-day functioning by unauthorised persons.

 BJP spokesperson Vijesh Lunawat defended the measure, saying members of these technical committees would help realise the agenda on which the BJP came to power in Madhya Pradesh. 

 We won the mandate on our charter and we are earnest about fulfilling it, he said.

 The move envisages a mix of state BJP leaders, retired officials, Sangh leaders and sympathisers who are experts in various fields being attached to various departments and ministries. These advisers would interact with the minister and officials of the department, give their recommendations when required and even attend meetings in the party office to monitor functioning.

 However, they would receive no honorarium or perks.

 The move was set in motion last month at the state BJPs brainstorming session at Panchmarhi, where MLAs accused chief minister Babulal Gaur of giving the bureaucracy a free run. 

 As Gaur went on the defensive, Chauhan seized the opportunity to underline the need to tame the bureaucracy. His suggestion that the government should benefit from the vast talent of BJP-RSS experts found instant favour.

 Gaur was initially opposed to the idea, said sources, but succumbed to pressure. He is on shaky turf as former chief minister Uma Bharti has repeatedly shown interest in reoccupying the post. In Gaurs scheme of things, keeping Chauhan and the MLAs on his side is crucial for his continuation as chief minister.

 In Vallabh Bhavan, the state secretariat, senior officials said they would make a formal representation to the chief secretary once the move is made public. 

 An official of the rank of principal secretary said the many problems included the one of secrecy. Ministers are under oath and bureaucrats are governed by service conduct rules, but these extra-constitutional authorities are not bound by either.

 The leader of Opposition, Jamuna Devi, said the Congress would oppose the move tooth and nail.

 Free power feels shock 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 10: Wracked by a power crisis, the Maharashtra government today decided to stop providing free power to the states 25 lakh farmers from June 1.

 To keep the farmers happy, however, the government announced a subsidised power scheme for them. The 10 months of free electricity to farmers has so far cost the state Rs 1,720 crore in revenues. The new scheme will help the government save around Rs 500 crore a year.

 The free power was announced by former chief minister S.K. Shinde in July 2004, three months ahead of the Assembly elections. The move helped the Congress-NCP return to power.

 The rollback comes just two days before chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh meets Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has promised to provide additional power. NCP chief and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar is to attend the meeting.

 Todays decision has been preceded by two weeks of intense protests in Pune, Nagpur, Amravati and Kalyan against load-shedding in rural areas. The state had imposed a nine-hour power-cut schedule for rural areas, while urban areas and IT hubs like Pune suffered for four hours.

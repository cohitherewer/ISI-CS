 Buddha meets a Bakri in Jakarta 

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Abu Rizal Bakri

 Jakarta, Aug. 25: Other than signing an agreement with the Salim Group on an economic zone, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee achieved what he called a major breakthrough with a coal mixing project at Haldia.

 He met Abu Rizal Bakri, another major Indonesian business giant who is also the most important minister in the government here, and put final touches to the project. Bakris son and a senior executive of the Bakri group has already visited Haldia and chosen a site for the project.

 It involves mixing good Indonesian coal with the Indian variety, processing it and supplying the mixed coal to thermal power plants. 

 Id no idea how big this business is, the chief minister said. 

 Several other Indonesian companies such as Ciputra, Mitra Adi Prakasha and Tungal have shown interest in investing in Bengal. 

 If Salim goes somewhere, the rest of Indonesian businessmen follow, said Ciputra, the 75-year-old chief of the company. 

 At a meeting between Bhattacharjee and local entrepreneurs, he asked Indonesian groups to take the opportunity and go to Bengal now, for in another 5 or 10 years, there would be too much competition for space.

 It was all music to the chief ministers ears.

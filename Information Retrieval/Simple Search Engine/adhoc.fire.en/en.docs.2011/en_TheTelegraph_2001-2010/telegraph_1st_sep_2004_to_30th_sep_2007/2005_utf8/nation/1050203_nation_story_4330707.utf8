 Jaya flaunts package reversal 

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Feb. 2: The Prime Minister has ?reversed? P. Chidambaram?s ?unilaterally made? rehabilitation package for tsumani-hit fishermen, Jayalalithaa said today.

 The Tamil Nadu chief minister had written to Manmohan Singh, protesting against the Union finance minister?s decision to deliver subsidy and loans to the fishermen directly through commercial banks for the purchase of boats and nets. She had accused Chidambaram of bypassing her government in routing the funds and thus hurting Centre-state relations.

 Jayalalithaa disclosed the latest information to thumping of desks in the Assembly and said the Centre?s official notification, received yesterday, mentions that the subsidy amount would be routed through the state government.

 Intervening in the debate on the motion of thanks to the governor?s address, the chief minister said the Centre had in effect indicated a transfer of Rs 983.68 crore. ?For now, we will be getting only Rs 733.68 crore,? she added, as Rs 250 crore provided by the Centre as immediate relief has been deducted from the package.

 Jayalalithaa took the opportunity to refute the charge of E. Pugazhendhi of the DMK that the third phase of relief and rehabilitation was being delayed. 

 She said the Centre was yet to release funds to kickstart the third phase.

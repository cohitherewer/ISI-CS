 Match-fixing cases under scanner again 

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Oct. 1: The cricket match-fixing cases could be reopened if it turns out that the man who busted the racket had made money while he was investigating them.

 Delhi police are trying to find out exactly how and when their blue-eyed boy, inspector Ishwar Singh, had amassed the disproportionate wealth that led to a CBI raid yesterday.

 He could have made the money during his stint at the crime branchs anti-extortion cell, CBI and police sources said. Perhaps he compromised himself while investigating a few big cases or took the opportunity ? as the Delhi polices star eavesdropper ? of tapping phones of powerful people and prying on their secrets.

 Or, he could have made a killing in his wet posting as station house officer with Connaught Place police station.

 If Singh (amassed his wealth) during the period when he busted the match-fixing scam and solved cases of extortion and kidnapping, these cases might be reopened. It may help unearth hidden facets of the match-fixing scam, a senior Delhi police officer said.

 CBI sources said they are still trying to ascertain how much Singh is actually worth and will make the next move depending on their findings.

 The agency seized Rs 1.07 lakh cash and assets worth Rs 75 lakh from Singhs home. It also listed his other possessions: a Rs 7.2-lakh plot, a flat (that the CBI valued at Rs 14 lakh but whose market value should be Rs 40-45 lakh) and a bank balance of Rs 1.6 lakh. He had also invested Rs 25 lakh in a petrol pump in Jind, Haryana.

 Team of four tips Sonia on shuffle

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, June 7: A powerful quartet, led by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, has Sonia Gandhis ears as she goes about her task of revamping the party organisation and its team of Union ministers.

 Other than Mukherjee, this inner group of advisers is made up of AICC general secretary Ambika Soni, political secretary Ahmed Patel and Union minister of state Oscar Fernandes, who is also chairman of the partys central election authority.

 Sonia has held at least three rounds of consultations with the quartet since last Saturday on recasting the Pradesh Congress Committees and the AICC set-up. 

 Sources said the party-level changes are linked to those that Sonia and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh plan in the middle and junior rungs of the Union ministry. Sonia began her discussions with the four leaders immediately after a lengthy meeting with Singh on Friday night on possible changes in the ministry. 

 The talks with the quartet, however, have apparently been inconclusive. Sources say the ministry shuffle is unlikely to happen before the Congress presidents Russia visit beginning next Monday. Before that, the Prime Minister will be visiting Siachen, Leh and Kargil.

 But some organisational-level changes will start happening before Sonias foreign trip. The Congress chief may name some state presidents. In Punjab, she may retain the incumbent, H.S. Hanspal, and name a working president.

 A decision on convening a special AICC meeting in Delhi may be taken by the weekend. The meeting is envisaged to hold elections to the working committee with a view to bringing Rahul Gandhi into the high executive body.

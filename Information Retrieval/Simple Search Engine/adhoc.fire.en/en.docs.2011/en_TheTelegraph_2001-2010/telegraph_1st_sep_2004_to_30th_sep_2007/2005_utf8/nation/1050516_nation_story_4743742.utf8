The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 First stirrings of thaw in BJP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 15: The BJP today said it might consider taking part in parliamentary standing committee meetings between the budget and monsoon sessions of Parliament.

 Everything, however, would depend on the ruling alliances attitude, former law minister Arun Jaitley told reporters this evening.

 Let us watch the conduct of the government itself, Jaitley said, referring to parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azads suggestion, made yesterday, to end the standoff between the Opposition and the UPA over the formers House boycott.

 If the Congress wants the Opposition to apologise before returning to Parliament, Jaitley said, then these media appeals are mere lip sympathies to break the stalemate.

 The BJP leader hinted that his party was not as adamant as before on the Parliament boycott and that it was quite comfortable on the Opposition benches. When the next session of Parliament approaches, the NDA will meet and plan its strategy, Jaitley said.

 He, however, declined to comment on the Telugu Desam Partys decision to attend the Houses. The TDP is entitled to take its decision and I wont comment on what they have said, Jaitley told reporters. 

 The former minister was at his best criticising the governments alleged failure to perform in its first year in office. 

 It was a year in which a continuous assault was made on constitutional institutions, he said, mentioning the attack on the Election Commission by railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav as the latest of them.

 This government prefers a Parliament without the Opposition. This has been a year of vindictiveness, Jaitley declared. 

 When the Phukan Commission gives a report exonerating George Fernandes (former defence minister), it is consigned to the dustbin and even a man of Arun Shouries integrity is harassed.

 It was a year of major compromises on national security. We have seen the inability of this government to push through major economic initiatives because of contradictions in their own support (the UPAs allies), he said.

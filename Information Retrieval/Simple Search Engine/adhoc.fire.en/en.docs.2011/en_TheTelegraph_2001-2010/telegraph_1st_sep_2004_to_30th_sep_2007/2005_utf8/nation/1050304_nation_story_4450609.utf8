 New Delhi, March 3: King Gyanendra may take the first step towards restoring normality to Nepal with the release of political leaders in the next few days.

 Sources said indications from Kathmandu are that the king, who has been facing mounting pressure from India and the international community ? particularly the US and the European Union ? may start releasing the democratic party leaders by next week.

 Gyanendra had taken them into custody since February 1 when he dismissed the Sher Bahadur Deuba government and declared emergency.

 He may still be dragging his feet on giving time to Indian ambassador Shiv Shankar Mukherjee for a meeting, but the signs show that the king has started wilting under pressure.

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh is scheduled to make a statement in Parliament soon, clarifying India?s stand on Nepal?s ?political turmoil? and, probably, stressing the need for immediate restoration of democracy there.

 India wants Gyanendra to release all political leaders, lift emergency, start talks with democratic leaders for a permanent solution to the Maoist problem, and strengthen democracy.

 India has withheld arms supplies to Nepal since February 1, which the palace sees as Delhi?s attempt to mount pressure on the king. 

 But Delhi has felt encouraged by the strong statements emerging from the West, particularly the US and the European Union, and the World Bank?s decision to withhold development aid to Kathmandu. 

 Singh?s scheduled statement may re-emphasise the Indian call for democracy in Nepal.

 Mukherjee was sent back there over a week ago with a strong message for Gyanendra, asking him to take immediate steps to restore democracy. Since then, the king has not given the ambassador time for a meeting. This is unusual for a Nepal monarch as he rarely keeps an Indian ambassador waiting for more than a week for an ?audience?.

 South Block sees Gyanendra?s decision as an attempt to register his protest against Delhi?s refusal to support him. But he may now be inclined to look for a way out of the tight corner he has pushed himself into and may meet the Indian ambassador to accomplish this.

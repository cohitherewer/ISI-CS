 Quit drama in Modi ministry

 Narendra Modi: Heat rises

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 22: He defied Modi; Modi ticked him off; so hes upset and wants to quit the cabinet.

 Thats the state of affairs for chief minister Narenda Modi, a day after BJP boss L.K. Advani found Gujarat under him blazing a trail for other states to follow.

 This evening, Bavkhubhai Unghad drove to the state BJP headquarters in an ambulance to seek party chief Vajubhai Valas permission to resign as minister of state for sports, youth and cultural activities.

 In a letter, 47-year-old Unghad is believed to have said he cannot continue in Modis cabinet as he is deeply hurt the chief minister rebuked him at last Wednesdays cabinet meeting.

 Unghad, considered close to Modis arch-rival Keshubhai Patel, had visited his mentors home last Tuesday in defiance of Modis diktat that he shouldnt as rebels were gathering there to renew their campaign against the chief minister.

 After Modi ticked him off the day after, an upset Unghad shut himself up in his office and refused to take calls. But he complained to his wife of chest pain and told her he had had an argument with the chief minister.

 Soon after, he was admitted to a hospital in Amreli and kept under observation for 48 hours.

 Modi loyalists dubbed his resignation request a political stunt. Other sources said it was a ploy to keep the sack-Modi campaign alive.

 Several MLAs are slated to visit Delhi soon to apprise the senior BJP leadership of the growing resentment against Modi.

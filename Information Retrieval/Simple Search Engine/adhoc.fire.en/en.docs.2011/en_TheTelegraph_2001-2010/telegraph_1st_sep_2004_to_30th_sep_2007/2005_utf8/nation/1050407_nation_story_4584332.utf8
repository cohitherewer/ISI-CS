 ?Travel is not worth the risk?

 Srinagar, April 6: Farhat Ara, 50, was visiting her husband at the Tourist Reception Centre when militants attacked the building hiding passengers who will take the bus to Muzaffarabad tomorrow.

 ?It was touch and go. The fire seemed to be approaching us fast when securitymen came and asked us to leave the building immediately through the rear exit. It is a miracle my husband and I are alive,? she said.

 Farhat?s husband, 60-year-old retired school headmaster Syed Zain-ul- Abbadin Shah, is one of the passengers on the inaugural bus that has been threatened by militants.

 When police knocked on the doors of their Jehangir Chowk residence last Sunday, saying they had come to escort her husband to a secure location, Farhat was gripped by fear for his safety.

 ?I told the police party that perhaps the travel was not worth the risk my husband would be taking if he had to remain in a safehouse as if he were some politician or VIP. I was not allowed to meet my husband after he was escorted out of the house till today,? she said.

 Fearing militant attacks, the passengers had all been moved to the reception centre where they have been living in virtual quarantine.

 Farhat?s fear heightened after today?s attack, to which she was an unwilling witness. ?What use is seeing your relatives if your family on this side of the line is going to face danger?? she asked. 

 ?The point of bus is that families across the Line of Control are to be united and for that they are to be separated from their relatives on this side and kept at an undisclosed place days before travel. It is a logic I fail to grasp.?

 Voicing the fear of a backlash after the bus returns and the hype subsides, Farhat said: ?We have to be on edge even after the safe return of my husband from Muzaffarabad. It is a hanging sword, God knows for how long.?

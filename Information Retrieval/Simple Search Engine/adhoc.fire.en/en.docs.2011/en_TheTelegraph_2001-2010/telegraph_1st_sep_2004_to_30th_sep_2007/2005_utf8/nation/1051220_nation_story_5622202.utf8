 Stampede transfer

 Chennai, Dec. 19 (PTI): Chennai collector S. Chandramohan was transferred today, a day after the stampede in a flood relief centre claimed over 42 lives.

 N. Muruganandam, the executive director of the Tamil Nadu Corporation for Development of Women Limited, will replace Chandramohan, who is yet to be given a new posting.

 A pall of gloom descended on the citys MGR Nagar, where a mad rush for flood relief coupons crushed 42 people to death yesterday morning. 

 Shops downed shutters, and silent processions were taken out in the area today. Residents also lit candles to pay homage to the dead.

 While some bodies were either buried or cremated yesterday on government expense, the rest were given their last rites today. The bodies of a few victims were taken to their native places.

 Hundreds of volunteers of the Democratic Progressive Alliance took out a silent procession. Led by DMK leader M.K. Stalin, the marchers protested against the improper distribution of relief to those affected by the rains.

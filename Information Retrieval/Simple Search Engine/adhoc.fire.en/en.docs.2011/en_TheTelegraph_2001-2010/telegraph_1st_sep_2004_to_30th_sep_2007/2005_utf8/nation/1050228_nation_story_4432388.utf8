 No Bihar, please: DMK

 Chennai, Feb. 27: The DMK today sought action against a Congress junior minister for demanding coalition rule in Tamil Nadu and cautioned that party against repeating a Bihar in the state.

 ?We demand the Congress high command take immediate action against the Union Minister (E.V.K.S. Elangovan), who at the February 24 Congress meeting in Chennai had personally abused Karunanidhi and his family members in the most derogatory manner,? said a resolution passed today at an urgent meeting of the DMK?s strategy committee.

 M. Karunanidhi said the Congress high command ?was free? to snap ties with his party but expressed the hope that the former would not ?repeat? in Tamil Nadu the rift in the United Progressive Alliance in Bihar ? to which he attributed the ?poor showing? by Laloo Prasad Yadav?s party.

 The DMK, however, appears unlikely to rock the UPA at the Centre for now after Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rang up Karunanidhi last night. Elangovan, too, had expressed regret yesterday.

 The party was not only perturbed by the state Congress?s coalition demand but took a serious view of the ?verbal cannon let loose in bad taste? by the likes of Elangovan.

 Elangovan did not stop with saying the ?time is ripe? for a Centre-like coalition in Tamil Nadu, Karunanidhi said after the two-hour meeting at Anna Arivalayam, the DMK?s headquarters here.

 ?He went beyond the coalition issue, personally ridiculed me by my caste name and charged me with once having organised an attack on his late father, E.V.K. Sampath, which is total gibberish,? the DMK chief said. Sampath had left the DMK in the early 1960s.

 The party, allaying fears of a pullout from the Centre, said it expected the Congress high command to take action against Elangovan based on Sonia?s assurance that such things will not recur and that her party ?will uphold coalition dharma?.

 ?Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh having telephonically expressed regrets to him (Karunanidhi) for the Congress minister having used scurrilous language against him, showed their magnanimity? and keenness to keep the UPA going, the resolution said.

 Asked whether the DMK was demanding Elangovan?s removal from the Union cabinet or the party, Karunanidhi said the Congress would have to decide whatever it ?deemed appropriate?.

 Karunanidhi was clear that Elangovan did not have the ?blessings of the Congress high command? to have brusquely raised the coalition issue. He suspected the remark was made at ADMK chief Jayalalithaa?s ?behest? to break the DMK-led state alliance.

 Elangovan apparently ?wants to strengthen his base within the party in the state by raising the coalition issue, but that is not the real reason?, the DMK chief said.

 According to Karunanidhi, the state Congress was ?contradicting? itself by speaking of ?reviving Kamraj rule on the one hand? and seeking a coalition government on the other. ?How can there be sharing of power if they want to bring back Kamraj rule, which simply means rule by the Congress??

 Insurance agent in fraud net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, April 22: Sudipta Banerjee, an insurance agent, faked a heist on himself last evening and went to police to lodge a complaint.

 He entered Burdwan police station in tattered clothes and told the officer on duty he had been hit by a car at nearby Bajepratappur and looted of a bag containing Rs 4.95 lakh, a gold bracelet and his mobile phone. The police launched a search for the car, but failed to locate it. 

 Questioning local people and a truck driver, the police got the sniff of a fraud. During interrogation, Sudipta, 30, broke down and confessed to lodging a false complaint.

 District superintendent of police Niraj Singh said Sudipta was supposed to deposit in bank Rs 4.95 lakh of policy holders? money that he claimed had been stolen. ?He wanted to pocket the amount and so he lodged the false complaint.? 

 The money and his mobile phone were recovered from his friend?s house. Sudipta was detained for interrogation and later released on a personal recognition bond.

 Road dream finds no takers

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, April 26: There are few takers for the ?four-lane? dream Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh is trying to sell.

 On Sunday, he announced that the Gaya-Patna Road would be included in the Golden Quadrilateral project and converted into a four-lane superhighway. 

 Reacting to the announcement, activist Shree Bhagwan Bhaskar said the people of the region would be happy if the Dardha bridge near Dhanarua was fixed and the Patna-Gaya Road periodically repaired to make it ?motorable?. The bridge collapsed more than two years ago and vehicles have to take a rather uncomfortable detour.

 The road, which becomes almost unusable after a moderate shower, turns into a death trap during monsoon. ?Hum din mein sapna nahin dekhte. Jo sarkar pool ki marammat nahin kar sakta woh four-lane superhighway kya banayega (I do not indulge in day-dreaming. How can a government, which cannot repair a bridge, be expected to provide a four-lane superhighway)?? Bhaskar asked.

 Bhaskar is not the lone sceptic. According to author Ahmed Qadri, Nitish Kumar, during his brief stint as Union surface transport minister, had announced that the Gaya-Patna Road (via Punpun-Parsa) was converted into a national highway. But for some milestones, there was nothing to justify the road?s status as NH 83. Even tractors overturned on the stretch between Punpun and Masaurhi.

 ?Such announcements do only one good?. they provide plots to fiction writers like me,? he joked.

 If the fate of ambitious schemes in the district is any indication, then the sceptics have reasons to question the announcements. 

 About seven months ago, railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav had laid the foundation stones for two overbridges in Gaya town. The project, which was to cost Rs 11 crore, is yet to see the light of day.

 More than nine months ago, Union energy minister P.M. Sayeed had laid the foundation stone for a Rs 80-crore power project to streamline the distribution network. That, too, has been a non-starter. 

 The food-for-work programme was started with fanfare in October 2004. But its progress has been far from satisfactory.

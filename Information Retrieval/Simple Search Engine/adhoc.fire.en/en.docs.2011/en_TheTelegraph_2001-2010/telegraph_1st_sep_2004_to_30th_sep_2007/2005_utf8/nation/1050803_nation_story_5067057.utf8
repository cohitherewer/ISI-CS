 Bid to soften N-critics

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The Prime Ministers advisers today used a Ficci function to try and win over some possible critics of the Indo-US nuclear pact a day before it is scrutinised in Parliament.

 The Left and the BJP-led Opposition alliance are expected to attack the government as both Houses discuss Manmohan Singhs US visit.

 At a function organised by Ficcis Indo-US Parliamentary Forum, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) aired the Centres view that the pact had not compromised Indias interests.

 The forum, which includes over 130 MPs, has Congress leader Murli Deora as chairman and the BJDs B.J. Panda as co-chairman. It counts among its members BJP MPs Manvendra Singh and Dushyant Singh, who are to speak on the pact in the Lok Sabha.

 The PMO also circulated a backgrounder among Congress MPs and the media that sought to address doubts about the agreement.

 For instance, the backgrounder asked: Does the commitment made by the US amount to recognition of India as a nuclear-weapon state? 

 Answer: The agreement? is not about nuclear-weapon status. The steps? should be seen as essential steps for broadening our co-operation in the civilian nuclear sector. We look upon this agreement as a recognition of Indias accomplishments in the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

 Question: Will such cooperation adversely affect Indias nuclear deterrent?

 Answer: Cooperation in the sectors of civilian nuclear energy and outer space between India and the US is predicated on India maintaining its indigenous nuclear and missile programmes, and the commitments made by India will have no impact whatsoever on our minimum credible nuclear deterrent.

 Delhi dash to restart Sikh riot probe

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: Acting faster than expected, the Centre has asked the CBI to probe whether Congress MPs Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar had any role in the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.

 The agencys investigation will also cover Delhi Congress leader Dharam Das Shastri. 

 The home ministry has sent to the CBI the request to look into the cases against the three Congress politicians, sources said.

 Copies of the Justice Nanavati Commission report have been attached to the request. The commission had found credible evidence against the three politicians and recommended further investigation.

 The move to forward the request assumes significance as the 21st anniversary of the riots on October 31 is approaching. The winter session of Parliament, where the Opposition is expected to raise the issue, is also nearing. 

 The furore that followed the tabling of the commissions report in August had forced Tytler to step down as minister and prompted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to apologise to Sikhs. 

 He had also said the government would consider reopening cases against those who have been indicted by the panel. 

 The government feels that the decision to reopen the cases would leave the Opposition with little ammunition to launch a fresh offensive.

 This is the second time the CBI has been asked to probe the cases. The agency had earlier proceeded against Tytler and Kumar but the cases had collapsed due to lack of evidence.

 The Nanavati Commission had made the following recommendations against the three politicians.

 Jagdish Tytler: Credible evidence against him. He very probably had a hand in organising attacks on Sikhs. It is recommended to take further action as may be found necessary. 

 Sajjan Kumar: Credible material against him. He was probably involved as alleged by witnesses. Investigation recommended into cases in which he was an accused.

 Dharam Das Shastri: Credible evidence that he instigated his men, Tek Chand Sharma and Rajinder Singh, to organise attacks. It is recommended that the relevant material be examined and further investigation taken up.

 The sources said the cases against the then lieutenant-governor P.G. Gavai, police commissioner S.C. Tandon and about a dozen police officials against whom the commission had made adverse observations, are not likely to make any headway.

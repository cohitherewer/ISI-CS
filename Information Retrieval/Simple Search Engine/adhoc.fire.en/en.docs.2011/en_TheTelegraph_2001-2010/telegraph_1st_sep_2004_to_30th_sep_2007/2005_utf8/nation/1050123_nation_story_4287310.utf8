 Nightmare on train

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 22: Train robbers struck again in railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav?s Bihar, looting three coaches of the Rampurhat-Gaya Express and shooting dead a passenger who tried to resist them. The victim?s uncle died of shock soon after the incident.

 Last night?s strike in Munger district, at a time when Bihar is headed for elections, is the latest in a series since Laloo Prasad took over as minister last year. The incident also happened on the eve of release of manifestos in which almost all parties vowed to rid the state of crime.

 Railway sources said six dacoits struck near Ratanpur station around 10 pm. When Umashankar Jaiswal of Purnea resisted them, he was shot dead. His uncle Mahesh Prasad Choudhary died of heart failure at the sight of his nephew?s body. ?Police have already launched a drive to arrest the culprits. They are narrowing in on some suspected gangs of the area,? a source said from Munger.

 The bodies were sent for post-mortem after the train reached Jamalpur.

 K.K. Varma, the superintendent of railway police (Jamalpur), said because of inadequate security personnel, no escort party was accompanying the train at the time of the attack. ?However, the train that was running two hours late was to get an escort party at Jamalpur,? he added.

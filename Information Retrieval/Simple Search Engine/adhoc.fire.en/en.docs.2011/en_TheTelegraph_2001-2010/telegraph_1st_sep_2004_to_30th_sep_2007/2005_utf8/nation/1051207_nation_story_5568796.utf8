 Reactor nod, four pacts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Moscow, Dec. 6: As Russia told India it would have to comply with global rules and separate its military and civilian nuclear facilities before enhanced cooperation in nuclear energy was possible, there was cheery news for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The news on the last day of his visit was that India has been accepted as a full partner in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project by consensus evolved among partner countries, which include Russia, China, Japan, the EU, the Republic of Korea and the US. The decision was taken in a meeting at Jeju in Korea today.

 An official release of the Indian government said the talks to finalise the ITER agreement were likely to be clinched shortly. It said Indias acceptance as a full partner was an acknowledgement of India as a responsible nuclear state with advanced nuclear technology, including in the field of fusion research.

 The three-day visit resulted in inking four agreements:

 Reciprocal Protection of 

 Intellectual Property Rights in military technical cooperation 

 Safeguard technologies 

 while implementing long-term cooperation in joint development, 

 operation and use of the Russian Global Navigation Satellite 

 System, GLONASS

 Cooperation in the field 

 of Solar Physics and Solar-terrestrial relationships within 

 the framework of the CORONAS-PHOTON project ? this mission 

 is aimed at research in solar physics and solar-terrestrial 

 relationships 

 To jointly design and produce 

 a multi-level transport aircraft using fifth-generation 

 multi-role fighter aircraft technology.

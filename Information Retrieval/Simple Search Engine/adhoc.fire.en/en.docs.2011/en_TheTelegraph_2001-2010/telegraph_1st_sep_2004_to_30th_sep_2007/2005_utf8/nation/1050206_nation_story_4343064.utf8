 Eye on minorities, Laloo longs for Modi

 Laloo Prasad: Calling the Hindutva brigade

 Patna, Feb.5: Laloo Prasad Yadav is desperately seeking Narendra Modi.

 Although he has another Modi (Lok Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi) to torment him, reports that Muslim voters are getting disillusioned with 15 years of his regime have made Laloo Prasad realise he needs the Modi from Gujarat to salvage his crumbling edifice.

 He wants the BJP to rake up Hindutva and make the blood of the minorities boil. RSS chief Praveen Togadia and the BJP?s Uma Bharti ? both champions of Hindutva ? are also being sorely missed.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief has been asking BJP leaders why the Gujarat chief minister is not coming to campaign in Bihar. ?I would like to hear what Modi has to say on the Justice Banerjee Committee report on the Godhra train fire,? he reportedly told a BJP minister at Patna airport.

 But the party is in no mood to oblige him. Though Uma did some lacklustre roadshows spewing venom against backwardness and lawlessness in the state, she has been kept away from her pet cause. Sources close to Laloo Prasad said he is also wondering why the BJP is not putting Togadia?s vocal chords to use.

 The BJP?s trick, however, appears to have paid off. The Muslims have not yet been roused into en bloc voting for the Muslim-Yadav combination, which spells doom for Laloodom.

 The signs of desperation in the RJD camp are visible. After Bhagalpur and Jehanabad, posters of the Gujarat carnage surfaced in Samastipur yesterday.

 With talk of a hung House gaining ground after the first phase of polls, a fierce fight is on for the second and third phases on February 15 and 23. The major players ? the RJD, the NDA partners, Congress and Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party ? are leaving nothing to chance.

 Making a mockery of criminalisation of Bihar ? an election plank for most parties ? the RJD, LJP and Nitish Kumar?s Janata Dal (United) have been generously doling out tickets to criminals. 

 At least four dons are in the spotlight in the second and third phases. While Mohammed Shahabuddin, the RJD MP who controls Siwan and its neighbouring areas, is expected to fetch between five to eight seats, Suraj Bhan, an upper-caste don and now an LJP MP, is expected to fill Paswan?s kitty with a few seats in Begusarai.

 RJD MPs Pappu Yadav and Mohammed Taslimuddin ? he is also a Union minister ? may turn out to be a source of trouble for Laloo Prasad. While Taslimuddin, who wields considerable clout in Kishanganj district, bordering Bangladesh, is not happy with the RJD chief for not giving tickets to some of his supporters, Pappu Yadav, currently in jail, has declared war against the RJD chief for ignoring his cronies.

 Pappu is now being indirectly approached by the BJP and the LJP either to transfer his votes to their candidates or work against the RJD in his area.

 RJD sources said Laloo Prasad is set to step up his offensive even on the Congress ? its ally at the Centre ? to net upper-caste votes. 

 Amid speculation that the Congress may not hesitate to cobble together a post-poll alliance with the LJP and the Dal (U), the RJD election in-charge, Bhola Prasad Singh, today warned the party against playing games. ?Any attempt to destabilise RJD may affect the health of UPA,? he said.

 Laloo Prasad is also desperately trying to keep his Muslim supporters in good humour and cautioning them that if his party is not voted back to power, the BJP may stage a comeback at the Centre as well.

 The BJP, on the other hand, is saying: ?If you do not vote for the NDA, you are doomed to another five years of Laloo raj.?

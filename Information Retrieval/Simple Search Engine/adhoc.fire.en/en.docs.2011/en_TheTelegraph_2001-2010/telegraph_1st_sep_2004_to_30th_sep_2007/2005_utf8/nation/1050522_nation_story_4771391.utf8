The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left irked by varsity quota

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 21: The CPM politburo has opposed Aligarh Muslim Universitys (AMU) decision to reserve 50 per cent seats for Muslim students in 36 postgraduate courses. 

 This is an inadvisable step, the party politburo said in a statement today. 

 It argued that AMU, being governed by an act of Parliament, has the status of a central university. It is not proper to have reservation on religious lines for students in such a university. 

 AMUs academic and executive councils have decided to reserve 50 per cent seats for Muslim students ? a decision the human resource development ministry had endorsed earlier this week. 

 The BJP has dubbed the decision communal and anti-national and has hinted that it will consider legal options to challenge the policy.

 The CPM said Article 30 guarantees protection for minority educational institutions. There can be a reservation quota for minority students under this provision. 

 It said the AMU did not come under the category of a minority educational institution. 

 The AMU Act, amended in 1981, states the university should be open to all religious faiths keeping with its tradition.

 Dalit dreams in fight with Laloo ?demon? 

 K.C. PHILIP 

 Madhubani, Feb. 14: A diminutive Dalit woman is leading a silent revolution in this Brahmin-dominated district.

 Sita Devi may be unlettered, but that has not deterred the Bahujan Samaj Party candidate from Pandaul or her supporters from aiming high. 

 Sita, who won several admirers for the work she has done under the umbrella of a local women?s self-help group, started campaigning even before she got a BSP ticket. ?If I win, then it will be for my people?I?m their candidate,? says Sita, the first Dalit woman to contest an election from Madhubani.

 As animator of the SHG, she made several Musahar women of her native Palivar village in Rajnagar block join hands for the development of the community. Under Sita?s leadership, the women took up the fight for the possession of a four-acre plot of land four years ago. Thanks to their efforts, forty households have ceased to be landless. 

 There is more to 35-year-old Sita?s achievements. ?Gone are the days when our children were sent to Delhi and Uttar Pradesh to work as bonded labourers. Besides, no higher caste men will ever dare to abuse or thrash us,? she says.

 Yet, it is a dream for most Dalits here to cast their votes by resisting the might of Yadavs and upper castes. 

 Over 2,000 people accompanied Sita to the district headquarters, where she filed her nomination papers, on January 25. She delivered her first official election speech at the Town Club ground shortly after the formalities.

 ?Do you think the present regime or the Opposition parties will ever deliver you social justice? We have to fight for our rights. I?m grateful to the BSP for accepting me. But don?t forget that I stand for you,? Sita told the audience. 

 A month into her campaign ? official and otherwise ? Sita has covered several villages on foot. ?Even upper caste men listened to me, although some spoke ill of me privately. But they can?t take Dalits for granted anymore, nor will they dare write me off now,? she says.

 ?I am a Dalit and continue to suffer as one. But if elected, I will work for the welfare of all communities as a true representative of the people,? Sita claims, sounding like a seasoned politician.

 ?This is a new experiment in the political empowerment of Dalits. Sita is perhaps the only true people?s candidate this time,? says Sudeep Chacko, director of Prabhat, an NGO.

 ?Though we have to contend with the RJD?s Muslim, LJP?s Yadav and the BJP?s Brahmin candidates, the equations are in our favour as we have the support of all Dalit and extremely backward caste voters,? claims Manohar Mandal, the campaign in-charge. 

 ?But exorcising the bhoot of Laloo Prasad Yadav from the people?s psyche is still a challenge for us,? says Chandra Kant, coordinator of Prabhat. He fears that Laloo Prasad?s ?charisma? will give the sitting MLA, Nayyar Alam, an edge.

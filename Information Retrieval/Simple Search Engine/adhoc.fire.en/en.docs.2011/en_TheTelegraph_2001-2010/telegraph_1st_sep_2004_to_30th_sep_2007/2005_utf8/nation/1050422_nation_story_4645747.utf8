 Mulayam woos Left with front call

 Mulayam Singh: Hopeful

 New Delhi, April 21: Mulayam Singh Yadav has invited Left leaders Harkishen Singh Surjeet and A.B. Bardhan to the Samajwadi Party?s national convention that has begun in Patna, hoping to revive a third front that will be equidistant from the Congress and the BJP.

 Surjeet will not be able to attend the meet due to ill health but Bardhan will.

 The Uttar Pradesh chief minister?s relations with the Congress are far from cordial. The party is hurting the Samajwadis? Muslim vote bank in the state. The BJP is Mulayam Singh?s principal adversary.

 But the Left, which is supporting the Congress-led alliance at the Centre, does not see any prospect of a third front emerging right now. At the 18th party congress that concluded recently, Prakash Karat, the CPM?s new general secretary, said the situation is not conducive to a third front at the moment. However, in the long run, the CPM hopes to put together such an alternative.

 The CPM and the CPI are clear that their task is to keep the United Progressive Alliance government in place at the Centre in order to keep the BJP out. 

 Former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu had said at the party congress that the Left needs the Congress as much as the Congress needs it.

 Mulayam Singh, however, would like to hasten the formation of the third front. 

 Rahul Gandhi, the Congress?s MP from Amethi, has added to the chief minister?s discomfort by openly attacking the Samajwadi Party government on law and order problems in the state.

 In Patna, Mulayam Singh today claimed: ?The Congress and the BJP are facing dissidence and the alliances headed by them are soon going to disintegrate. The SP and the Left parties will then put together a strong and viable third front.? 

 The Left parties, which do not see eye to eye with the Congress on economic issues, would be most comfortable supporting a third front government like they did in 1996. But their earlier experiences with successive third fronts have not been pleasant.

 The People?s Front, the backbone of the United Front between 1996 and 1997, had crumbled like a pack of cards when one partner after another pulled out. 

 It was Mulayam Singh who had dealt the last blow when he withdrew from the front after deciding to back the NDA?s presidential candidate A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

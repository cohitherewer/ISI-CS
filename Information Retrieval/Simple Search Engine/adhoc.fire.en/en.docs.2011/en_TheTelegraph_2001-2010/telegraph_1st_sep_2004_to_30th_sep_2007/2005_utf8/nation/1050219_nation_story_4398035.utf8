 Arrests cut short protest

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Feb. 18: More than 15 political activists were arrested here when they demonstrated against the February 1 royal coup today to coincide with the annual Nepal Democracy Day.

 The short demonstration happened despite all the royal government?s efforts to quell any form of protest during Democracy Day celebrations.

 For the second time this month, all telephone lines were cut off at 6 am to prevent people from communicating with each other and discussing any possible plans for street protests. The lines were restored at 4 pm.

 The government also deployed the army and armed police all over the city to prevent people from assembling at any given point. Security at the homes of politicians under house arrest since February 1 was also beefed up.

 Hundreds of people mobilised by the government, however, took to the streets to celebrate Democracy Day and hail the royal takeover. They also flocked to the Kathmandu valley?s parade ground to attend Queen Komal?s 55th birthday celebration, which King Gyanendra presided over.

 Earlier, the king used his Democracy Day address to the nation to lash out at political parties and Maoist rebels. He justified his actions and defended the coup in the address, which was broadcast over the state-owned media.

 A defiant Gyanendra claimed that he dismissed the Sher Bahadur Deuba government and took charge mainly to safeguard democracy, which, according to him, was under threat from the Maoists and inefficient political parties.

 ?Terrorist activities, coupled with politics far removed from the common man, gave a fillip to instability in the nation, putting democracy at risk,? he said. 

 Irrespective of the semblance of normality in the valley, rural Nepal continued to be paralysed by the Maoists-imposed indefinite transport blockade, which entered its seventh day today. 

 The army continued to escort vehicles in and out of Kathmandu but the movement of cargo was reduced to a trickle.

 Transporters said that only 200 vehicles entered the valley as against the normal traffic of 1,200 trucks a day. As a result, prices of several essential commodities have begun to soar in the valley.

 Mixed bag for Salem

 Salem 

 New Delhi, July 20: Portugals highest constitutional court rejected Abu Salems appeal against extradition on Monday, but it could be months before the underworld don can be brought back to India.

 The reason, CBI sources said, is a request for the gangsters extradition that had been made by Madhya Pradesh police in connection with a local case. 

 The case is still pending in the high court of Lisbon, and till it is disposed of, Salem cannot be handed over.

 Even if the high court rules in favour of extradition, Salem can probably appeal in a higher court and buy more time, a source said.

 Salem is wanted in connection with the 1993 serial blasts that killed about 250 people in Mumbai. He and his companion Monica Bedi were arrested in Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, on September 18, 2002.

 To strengthen the case for his extradition, the Indian government had given Portugal an executive assurance that Salem would not be awarded the death sentence if found guilty of the charges against him. 

 European law bans extradition of any accused to a country where capital punishment is in vogue for the crime he is charged with.

 Bedis extradition was sought in connection with a passport forgery case in Hyderabad. After prolonged hearing, the high court of Lisbon granted Salems extradition in July last year, but only for the charges not punishable with death or life imprisonment.

 The Portuguese public prosecutor, at the instance of the CBI, appealed in the supreme court of Portugal against the high court order. Salem, too, filed an appeal against the order granting his extradition.

 The supreme court of Portugal rejected Salems appeal and authorised the gangsters extradition for all the crimes included in the extradition request.

 Salem had then appealed to the constitutional court of Portugal.

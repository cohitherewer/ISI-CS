 Mirchi on UN hot list

 Mirchi

 London, Feb. 13 (PTI): Iqbal Mirchi, sought by Indian police in connection with the 1993 Bombay blasts and other cases, is among the top 50 global druglords, a UN report has said.

 According to the report, Mirchi, who has lived in the Essex town of Hornchurch, the UK, the last 15 years, is a senior figure in don Dawood Ibrahim?s ?D? company, a worldwide organised crime syndicate.

 Mirchi, though, has claimed in an interview to The Observer on Sunday that he has no involvement in organised crime or terrorism. He also said he has written to the US state department expressing outrage over his name being included in the list of druglords.

 ?The British police, the Indian police, the American police, all have my address because I have written to them and told them. If I am a kingpin and they want to arrest me, they know exactly where to find me,? he told the paper.

 Mirchi, however, admitted meeting Dawood in Dubai. ?He is from Mumbai, I am from Mumbai. There was some contact but I have never worked for him. It was social. These people are the mafia, they kill people. I have never hurt anybody in my life,? he claimed.

 ?...I have offered to return to India but asked for a guarantee that I would be given judicial protection,? he told the paper. 

 Last week, his name cropped up during the trial of Hemant Lakhani, an NRI accused of smuggling a shoulder-launched missile to the US. Lakhani is said to be one of Mirchi?s associates.

 A request for Mirchi?s extradition to India was turned down by magistrates at Bow Street here.

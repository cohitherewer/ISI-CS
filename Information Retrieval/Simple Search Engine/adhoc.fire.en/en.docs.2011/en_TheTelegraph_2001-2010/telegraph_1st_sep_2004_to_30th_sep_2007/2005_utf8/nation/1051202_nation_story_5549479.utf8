 Take poll test: Digvijay

 Bhopal, Dec. 1: Enjoying the disquiet in the Madhya Pradesh BJP, former chief minister Digvijay Singh has dubbed Uma Bhartis ongoing Ram, Roti yatra the Rozi-roti yatra (bread-and-butter yatra) and advised her to take on chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan in an election.

 If Uma is serious about teaching him (Chauhan) a lesson, she should contest against the chief minister as an Independent, Digvijay said. It will be a befitting test of her support base in the state.

 In the 2003 Assembly polls, Chauhan had contested against Digvijay from the Raghogarh Assembly segment and lost badly. Chauhan is Lok Sabha MP from Vidisha. He has to get elected to the Assembly within six months of assuming office as chief minister.

 Uma trained guns on the BJPs central leadership, accusing it of indulging in indiscipline by making public the contents of the showcause notice served on her. 

 I dont know how to reply to the notice ? before (the) people or in a sealed envelope, an angry Uma said. It was appropriate to announce that I have been served a notice by the parliamentary board. But handing out the notice to (the) press?, doesnt it amount to indiscipline? she asked.

 When it was pointed out that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and party president L.K. Advani, too, had charged her with indiscipline before television cameras, Uma said sarcastically: It was not indiscipline. But when I reply to the charges, it becomes indiscipline.

 Asked about loyalist Prahlad Patels resignation from the BJP, she said he quit despite her advice against it. He seemed upset over the developments, Uma said, claiming she had asked the MLAs and other leaders, who were issued showcause notices, to tender apologies.

 Some apologised and others like Prahlad Patel sought (to do) otherwise, she said.

 Asked whether she planned a similar move, Uma said: I am BJP. BJP means the ideology of workers on the street. I consider the government (Madhya Pradesh) as my child and like a mother, I am trying to save it, without letting it to be harmed.

 Chief minister Chauhan has deferred the expansion of his council of ministers by a week and postponed the Assembly session slated for December 5 to 16. Sources said the idea was to let the Uma episode blow over before forming his ministry.

 A group of BJP MLAs and ministers considered loyal to Uma, which has not walked out with the suspended leader, now expects some rewards in return. 

 The anti-Uma lobby, too, is hoping to bounce back. Former chief minister Babulal Gaur is eyeing the post of Speaker. As a loyal partyman, he was not hankering for office but keen to serve the party in some capacity, Gaur said.

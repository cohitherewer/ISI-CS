 Voter fear holds the key in Bihar

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: Fear is the key to the third phase of elections in Bihar, with the Muslim apprehension of the BJP and the upper-caste uneasiness over Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav being the factors that will tilt the balance.

 The last phase of the elections on February 23 ? that has become a nightmare for psephologists ? is crucial for Laloo Prasad, whose party had won 52 of the 93 seats going to polls in 2000.

 Of the 243 seats, the Muslim-Yadav factor dominates 119 seats, accounting for 30 per cent of the electorate with Muslims alone mattering in 75 constituencies. Analysts said, even in the best of times, Muslims did not vote en bloc for the RJD. 

 In 2000, the party?s tally in the state was 132 with only 66 per cent Muslims backing him. In 2004, with the Congress and Paswan aligning with the RJD, the party secured 80 per cent of the Muslim vote.

 RJD sources said the media and pollsters have ignored that a crucial factor to the advantage of Laloo Prasad is the creation of Jharkhand state as the Yadav population in the parts remaining in Bihar has swelled by 4-5 per cent. The party?s voteshare in undivided Bihar was 28.17 per cent. This shot up to 32.70 per cent after the division of the state.

 However, it remains to be seen whether the increase in Yadav voters would neutralise a host of other hostile factors working against the RJD. 

 In more than a dozen seats, most of it won by the RJD, the victory margin was between 35 and 868 votes. This will be to the party?s disadvantage with a divided United Progressive Alliance. In 45 seats, the victory margin was around 5,000 votes and in 39 it was between 5,000 and 10,000.

 The picture has become hazy with vast changes in the dynamics of the electoral scenario since 2000 and a divided Congress-led coalition taking on a united National Democratic Alliance.

 Besides, a strong and resurgent BJP had worked in Laloo Prasad?s favour and with the party losing power at the Centre and being down and out in Bihar, the RJD leader has a problem. The BJP changed its strategy after the initial inertia, with the media and pollsters writing them off. It also adopted a low profile to ensure that Muslims were not apprehensive and did not consolidate behind Laloo Prasad.

 The BJP has scattered Muslim votes between the Congress, the RJD and the Lok Janshakti Party, while consolidating the upper-castes behind the NDA. It also attacked Paswan, saying that he will shake hands with Laloo Prasad after the polls to ensure that his party does not lure away the upper-castes.

 The vote difference between NDA and the RJD combines was about 8 per cent. NDA strategists feel that with Paswan deserting Laloo Prasad, the RJD is bound to lose at least 5 per cent of the 8.2 per cent votes polled by the Lok Janshakti.

 The Congress is becoming redundant in the third phase and Paswan?s credibility is touching a low with his talk of making a Muslim the chief minister. The LJP leader has also spoken in favour of President?s rule in the state and has also said that he would be the next chief minister. All this has contributed to Laloo Prasad?s worries.

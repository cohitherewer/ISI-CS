 Kabul back on Delhi flight path

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: The government today decided to resume Indian Airlines flights to Kabul from March 27.

 It also opened the skies to flights from France, raising the number of weekly flights between the two countries to 35 from current 14. The new pact with France also allows India to designate carriers other than Air-India and Indian Airlines to fly to that country.

 The move, which follows a substantial expansion in flight services to the US and the UK, is expected to help private carriers Jet and Sahara fly to Paris. 

 France has also allowed Fifth Freedom traffic rights to Indian carriers, permitting them to operate to points beyond France. This is expected to enable flights out of India to touch France en route to the US and Canada. 

 This means that Indian carriers will be able to fly to New York and four more points in the US, as also to Toronto and Montreal in Canada, after a stopover in France.

 India allowed the French to fly to new airports at Bangalore and Hyderabad, besides the existing ports of call at Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai and Chennai.

 The government also signed a pact offering to help war-ravaged Afghanistan rebuild its civil aviation sector. Among other things, India will help Afghanistan to upgrade its air traffic management system and maintain aircraft.

 Girls shake off marriage to misery

 Calcutta, Nov. 10: Shibnandan Ram isnt surprised at the similar tales told by Moni Kumari and Priya. It happens in aat anna (50 per cent) families in Bihar, the father of Moni Kumari shrugs.

 What separates Moni and Priya from most fellow sufferers is that they sought an escape and landed in Howrah station. On Thursday, they were handed back to their families by the social welfare department at Sukanya home, Salt Lake.

 The shy, 20-year-old Moni was married to Santosh of neighbouring Kahelgaon village. He would drink and beat me up. My mother-in-law also kept up a torrent of abuse, she says. Moni bore it for three months; and then fled.

 A train ride and a 15-day-stay at a state home later, she met her folks again. Monis family had kept her disappearance under wraps to avoid badnami.

 She should have borne it. This happens in every home. Do they run away? father Shibnandan wondered. 

 Eldest brother Umesh was more indignant. She was brought up in luxury in our pucca house. Her in-laws stay in a jhopri and must have asked her to do chores.

 The father, a shop-owner in Bhagalpur, promises to let her stay with him if she doesnt want to return to her in-laws. He is even ready to discuss a second marriage, if she so wishes.

 But marriages come at a price in Bihar. Ram has shelled out a dahej of Rs 31,000 and spent another Rs 30,000 on the wedding. With a second daughter to marry off, can he afford to spend more on Moni?

 Priyas ordeal began much earlier ? at age eight, and four years ago. Her mother, a deserted wife, was only too happy marrying her off to a man in his thirties. He was already married, with a daughter older than Priya. It was Priyas uncle who arranged the marriage.

 Last year, they locked me up in a goatshed. A huge man came and said he would take me away as he had paid my uncle Rs 35,000. So she fled.

 The 12-year-old spent a night in the wheat fields, fending off wolves. The local police eventually sent her back to her mother but the stay was short. 

 She saw someone from her in-laws at a fair and vanished, said Utpal Ray of Diganta, who followed the route described by the daughter to fetch the mother from Banka district.

 Mother Sangeeta Devi is a bewildered woman. My uncle betrayed us, Priya spoke on her behalf. 

 After a year of moving from shelter to shelter in Bengal, the jeans-clad girl looks a far cry from the village child who fled her home. 

 Can she adjust to the rural ambience now? wondered Nilima Krishnamurthy, chairperson of the Child Welfare Commission, as she signed her release order.

 Cancer queries at your fingertips

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, May 26: Someone you know has a chronic stomach pain and is losing weight. Should he see a cancer specialist?

 Someone in the family has tongue cancer; should he eat from a separate plate? To find out the answers, all you need to do is dial 044-55167688. Or email your queries to cancerhelpyahoogroups.com.

 The Government Royapettah Hospital in Chennai has set up a 24-hour Cancer Help Line to help people get rid of their doubts, suspicions and prejudices relating to cancer and to offer patients across the country and their families any assistance they might need.

 It is the hospitals doctors who will take turns at manning the helpline desk, said Dr R. Rajaraman, head of the department of surgical oncology at the hospital.

 The helpline has several objectives. One, to dispel myths surrounding cancer. Examples: that the disease is contagious, that patients need to be kept in total isolation, that cooking for them must be done in separate vessels. Two, to drive the message home that early detection brightens the chances of a near-complete cure.

 Another objective is to make people understand that cancer treatment doesnt end with surgery ? which must be followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy ? and encourage them to come for regular check-ups even after treatment.

 Finally, to see that more people from different parts of the country are able to access it (the helpline) and even actually come here for free treatment if they wish, Dr Rajaraman said. In future, we plan to have a website of our own.

 The initial response to the helpline has been good. On the first two days, we got about 200 telephone calls while the first email was from Dubai. 

 An average of 20,000 cancer patients come every year to the hospital to be treated free of cost, about 2,500 of them being new patients.

 The hospital has developed several innovative methods of cancer treatment, Dr Rajaraman said. He cited two cases:

 Government clerk Jayaprakasam of Thiruvonam had cancer of the elbow or soft-tissue sarcoma. He did not want his arm amputated ? usually the first step in the treatment of this form of cancer. 

 What we did was remove the cancerous portion and fix the (unaffected part of the) forearm to the arm bone so that Jayaprakasam could still work as a clerk, the doctor said.

 The other patient, Prakkash of Chennai, had bone tumour in the hip. We replaced the affected bone with a bone from a cadaver. This was the first time this type of cancer treatment was done in India.

 Thus the helpline would also enable people to know about the new cures. Our investment on this was very little: just a dedicated telephone line and a computer the government gave our cancer department to receive and send emails, Dr Rajaraman said.

 Shukla on Cong radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 8: Fresh efforts are on to pave the way for V.C. Shuklas return to the Congress. 

 With his Chhattisgarh rival Ajit Jogis stocks down after son Amits arrest in a murder case, Shuklas chances seem to have brightened.

 The question of re-admitting the former chief minister was reportedly discussed at a meeting of AICC office-bearers at the party headquarters this evening. We took up some of the pending applications for admission to the party, said a source. 

 Party treasurer Motilal Vora, Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel and AICC general secretary Ambika Soni were present at the meeting. Vora, one of Jogis prominent detractors, heads the Chhattisgarh Congress.

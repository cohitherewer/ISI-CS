 Glare back on tainted five

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, July 15: The Supreme Court today asked the attorney-general to help it decide on a public interest litigation that has challenged the presence of Laloo Prasad Yadav and four other tainted ministers in the Union council.

 The division bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice P.K. Balasubramanyan also appointed senior counsel Rakesh Dwivedi amicus curiae ? or friend of the court ? to assist it and fixed August 1 for the next hearing.

 The petitioner contends there are ministers tainted and having criminal track record and cases, the bench said after hearing A.K. Jha, the lawyer for Manoj Narula, who had filed the PIL.

 We ask the attorney-general and also the amicus curiae to assist this court in deciding the issue of maintainability of the petition as a PIL and also whether a direction to Parliament would be possible for debating the issue.?

 The judges said a similar plea and a review petition had earlier been dismissed after the Centre assured the court it would debate the topic in Parliament. 

 But now that the petitioner has contended that Parliament, despite sitting for about three months, did not debate the matter, the court wanted the attorney-general to advise it, they said.

 The bench ordered copies of the petition to be given to the attorney-general and the amicus curiae.

 Besides Laloo Prasad, the petition ? which has also sought a ban on appointing persons with criminal records as central or state ministers in future ? lists the names of Mohammed Taslimuddin, Jai Prakash Yadav, M.A.A. Fatmi and K. Venkatapathy. Cases are pending against all the five ministers.

 The PIL challenged their appointment on the ground that ministers who are required to carry out important constitutional functions should be of impeccable integrity. Jha said ministers with criminal records jeopardised public interest. 

 The tainted ministers issue had snowballed last year after an arrest warrant was issued against Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Shibu Soren in a murder and arson case. But the warrant reached the locked doors of the Union ministers official bungalow in New Delhi. Soren, however, surrendered later before a trial court and stepped down as minister.

 Law minister H.R. Bhardwaj said the Centre was ready to frame a guideline on the subject and also for a debate.

 PF players wait for Singh to step in

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: The central board of trustees of the employees provident fund organisation today failed to arrive at a decision on the rate of interest to be paid to its subscribers for the current financial year.

 The board, chaired by labour minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, has decided to meet again on December 7. The fund does not have the resources to sustain the interest rate at the current 9.5 per cent but trade unions are insisting that the payout should be left untouched. 

 Rao indicated that the board is also examining the option of investing up to 5 per cent of its corpus in mutual funds and equities.

 The finance ministry has permitted investments in mutual funds and equities. An expert committee is examining the options of investment and the report is expected shortly, Rao said after a meeting that lasted almost six hours.

 The labour minister said he would brief the Prime Minister. I will definitely apprise the Prime minister and it is my duty as a colleague to do so, he said.

 The trade unions, which represent the subscribers, have asked the labour minister to impress upon the Prime Minister the need to increase the rate of interest on the special deposit scheme (SDS) ? the government facility in which the provident fund parks over 65 per cent of its cash.

 We request you to kindly take up the issue of enhancing the rate of interest on the SDS, as well on government bonds, with the Prime Minister, a joint representation by nine big trade unions asked the minister.

 The finance ministry has so far resisted attempts to raise the interest rate paid on the special deposit scheme accounts. The government now pays the provident fund 8 per cent, 1.5 percentage points less than what is passed on to subscribers. 

 The labour minister was non-committal about a revision in the rate of interest for provident fund subscribers. It is not a question of hope, it is a question of accounts, Rao said, asked whether he was hopeful that the 9.5 per cent interest rate could be maintained.

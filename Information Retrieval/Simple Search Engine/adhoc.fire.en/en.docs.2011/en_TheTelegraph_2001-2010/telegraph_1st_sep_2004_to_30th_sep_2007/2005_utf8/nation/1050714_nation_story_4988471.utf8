 Dhaka demands bus for bus

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 13: Bangladesh is demanding a return for having allowed India to run the Calcutta-Agartala bus through Dhaka with a double entry visa.

 It has asked India again to let it run a bus from Dhaka to Kathmandu through Siliguri. But the demand has put India in a spot as Northeast militants could avail the bus, making it dangerous for the countrys internal security.

 Official sources said though the double entry visa had been decided on at last years home secretary-level talks, Dhaka had started issuing them only after the June 22 talks between the foreign secretaries.

 This was after India had given positive feedback about the proposed Dhaka-Kathmandu bus. But Delhi is now having second thoughts. 

 External affairs ministry officials said Dhakas request was still being processed as several ministries and other organisations are involved.

 Sources said intelligence agencies and paramilitary forces are not in favour of allowing the bus as militant outfits like the Ulfa, NSCN and the Maoists could use it to access Tibet and China through Nepal. 

 However, if it refuses Dhakas request, the Agartala-Calcutta bus service could be in jeopardy.

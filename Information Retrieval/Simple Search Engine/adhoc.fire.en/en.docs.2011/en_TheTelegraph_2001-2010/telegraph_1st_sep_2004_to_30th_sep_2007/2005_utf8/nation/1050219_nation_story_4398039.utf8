 Suicide report puts YSR in spot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 18: The Andhra Pradesh government is in two minds whether to table the Jayati Ghosh report on farmer suicides in the Assembly this session.

 The report links the agrarian crisis to a combination of ?macro liberalisation and globalisation policies? at the central government level, specific policies of the state and local governance failures. About 3,000 farmers have committed suicide in the last two years.

 The Left parties and the Telugu Desam Party are clamouring to have the report tabled. The Desam is on the offensive though the report slams the N. Chandrababu Naidu regime for creating the crisis by mindlessly pursuing liberalisation and globalisation.

 Congress chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, who commissioned the report, is in two minds because he will have to detail the steps his regime plans to take to improve the farmers? lot once the report is placed in the House. This would entail taking policy decisions on liberalisation, globalisation and market reform.

 Soon after it assumed power, Reddy appointed Ghosh, a professor of agricultural economics in JNU, as chairperson of the farmers? commission to study the suicides and suggest remedies.

 Two months ago, she handed in a detailed report, saying agriculture in Andhra was in an advanced state of crisis and farmers? suicides were an extreme manifestation of this.

 ?The policies of the central government since the beginning of the 1990s have had direct and indirect effects on farmers? welfare. The economic reforms did not include any specific package specifically designed for agriculture,? the report said.

 Giving reasons and listing suggestions, it said the combination of low prices and output volatility for cash crops had had the most adverse effect on farmers. While output volatility increased with new seeds and other inputs, the prices of most non-foodgrain crops weakened, and some prices, such as those of cotton and oilseeds, plummeted for prolonged periods.

 In the absence of state protection, farmers had to operate in an uncertain and volatile environment, competing against highly subsidised large producers in developed countries. They had even taken to selling kidneys to raise money, the report said.

 It attributed the crisis to public policy and, in particular, to an economic strategy at both the central and state levels, which systematically reduced the protection afforded to farmers and exposed them to market volatility and private profiteering without adequate regulation.

 ?The state of Andhra Pradesh had become almost a laboratory for every neo-liberal economic experiment, with a massive shift towards relying on incentives for private agents as opposed to state intervention and regulation of private activity, in virtually all areas,? the report said.

 The decline in the government?s role began when the state started incurring massive external debts from bilateral and multi-lateral agencies. Many problems in its economy can be traced to this reduction in government role and the collapse of a wide range of public institutions, the report said.

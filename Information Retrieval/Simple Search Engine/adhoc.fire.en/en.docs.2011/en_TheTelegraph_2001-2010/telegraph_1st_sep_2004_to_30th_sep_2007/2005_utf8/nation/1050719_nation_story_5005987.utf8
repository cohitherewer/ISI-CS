 Power contract haunts Left

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, July 18: The CPMs Kerala unit and the partys state secretary, Pinarayi Vijayan, have come under a cloud over a Rs 374-crore electricity contract awarded to SNC Lavalin of Canada by the previous Left government.

 The Kerala electricity board had awarded the contract to Lavalin in February 1997 ? when Vijayan was the states power minister ? without a global competitive bid. 

 The award followed a commitment by the company that it would mobilise Rs 98 crore for setting up a cancer hospital at Tellichery in Kannur, the Assembly constituency of the late chief minister, E.K. Nayanar.

 The deal was struck apparently during a visit to Canada by Vijayan and senior power officials. Doubts were then raised about the contract but the Left government cited the charity component to silence critics.

 Congress leader A.K. Antony, who came to power in 2001, was loathe to probe the contract as this could be seen as witch-hunting. This also bogged down the state vigilance bureau, which has not been able to make much headway in the probe for the last four years.

 However, the deal has assumed the proportions of a major scandal with the accountant-general making a preliminary finding that the contract had resulted in a loss of Rs 110 crore to the board.

 The CPM, which sponsored a no-confidence motion against the Congress-led state government, is facing more discomfort with the scandal becoming the centrepiece of the no-trust debate.

 The Marxists, who oppose the US armed intervention in Iraq, could be in more hot water when it becomes public that SNC Tech, a subsidiary of SNC Lavalin, has been a major supplier of small-arms ammunition to various countries, including the US. In Canada, anti-war protesters have stepped up their campaign against SNC Tech, which had allegedly supplied five million bullets for US soldiers in Iraq.

 The power deal is in stark contrast to the tough anti-imperialist advice CPM general secretary Prakash Karat gave Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about his US visit.

 Chief minister Oommen Chandy is learnt to have decided to announce the governments stand on expediting the probe in the Assembly tomorrow during his reply to the debate on the no-confidence motion. State Congress president Ramesh Chennithala plans to convert his Kerala yatra in August into an anti-CPM campaign.

 The Muslim Leagues state general secretary, P.K. Kunhalikutty, said in Kozhikode today that his organisation would support the government on a thorough probe into the contract. The BJP wants a probe by the CBI.

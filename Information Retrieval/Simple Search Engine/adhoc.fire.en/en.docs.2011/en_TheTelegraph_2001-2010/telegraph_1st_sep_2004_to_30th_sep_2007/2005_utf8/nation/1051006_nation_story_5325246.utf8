 Girl in love, dad head over heels

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: Alls well that ends well, only the father of the bride collapsed in the courtroom.

 Mahendra Kumar, 46, fainted after his 21-year-old daughter told the court that she had, of her own will, married a man accused of kidnapping her.

 Metropolitan magistrate Chandra Sekhar then accepted the girls request that the accused, Sonu, be acquitted. Since they were adults, the magistrate said, they were free to go wherever they want.

 The girl had left her home in east Delhis Mandawli on September 7, saying she wanted to see a doctor. When she failed to return, her father lodged a missing persons report with the police.

 Kumar also lodged an FIR against Sonu, a neighbour who had gone missing around the same time, under IPC Sections 365 (kidnapping for confining secretly) and 366 (inducing a woman to compel her to marry). He suspected the young couple were in love.

 Sonu, accompanied by the girl, surrendered before the court on Tuesday. 

 The girl said she loved Sonu, denied she was kidnapped and declared she was happily married and that the decision was our own.

 Kumar could not take it any more and slumped to the floor.

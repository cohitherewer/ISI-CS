 Will to live beats three killer waves

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

Port Blair, Jan. 11: Three killer waves and 

two broken collar bones were not enough to crush Santosh Augu?s will to live. 

Seventeen days after the tsunami swept the coast, the Nicobarese survivor was 

found injured, but alive, near Campbell Bay. 

 Santosh, who was flown by the Coast Guard to Port Blair today and rushed to Dhanwantari Hospital, is a field assistant with the Andaman and Nicobar Environment Team. He was accompanying a team of scientists, led by biologist Ambika Tripathy, studying Leatherback turtles near Campbell Bay. 

 At 6 am on December 26, Santosh and seven others were on the field on Great Nicobar Island. ?When we saw the water coming, we all climbed up a tree,? recalls Santosh, who stepped off a Coast Guard aircraft with an IV drip, refused a stretcher and limped his way across the hot tarmac to an ambulance close at hand. 

 The first wave struck, the second wave followed, but the team managed to hold on, even filming some footage, Santosh says. The third wave, however, uprooted the whole tree. He hasn?t seen his companions since. 

 Bones broken, surviving on seawater and no food, Santosh walked to higher ground. After spending days in the ruins, the man who appeared to be in his early 30s, reached a jungle, where he finally got some sleep. 

 ?Then I met someone who gave me some food,? Santosh mutters, disoriented but preferring to sit up, even inside the ambulance. 

 Santosh was finally found around 11 am today at the 35 km point on the island and the Coast Guard was immediately notified. ?A helicopter left from the Brahmaputra, a naval ship anchored at Campbell Bay,? explains Commandant Anil Pokhariyal, commanding officer of the Coast Guard at Port Blair. 

 He and another patient were transferred by air to Port Blair by 2 pm. On preliminary examination, a doctor who was present on arrival said Santosh ? complaining of chest pain ? may have also suffered contusion of the lung, but was stable. ?It is unbelievable that a man with two broken collar bones walked that kind of distance,? the doctor adds. 

 Had Santosh strayed to the western side of the island, his chances of survival would have been diminished, points out Pokhariyal, as the area is infested with crocodiles. 

 This rescue, the last in a long list for men at the frontline of Operation Madad, holds out hope that at least a few more on the missing list ? and possibly even the lost scientist and his team ? may miraculously turn up alive.

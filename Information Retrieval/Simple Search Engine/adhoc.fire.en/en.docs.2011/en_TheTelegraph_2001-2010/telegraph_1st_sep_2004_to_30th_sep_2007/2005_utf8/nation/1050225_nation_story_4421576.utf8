 Sibal suspends secretary

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: Union science and technology minister Kapil Sibal today suspended his additional private secretary following complaints from a bureaucrat that the aide was trying to use his name to swing tenders in favour of a particular party.

 Sibal suspended Yogesh Buta and instituted an inquiry into the charges levelled by National Brain Research Institute director Vijayalakshmi Ravindranath. Buta joined Sibal?s personal staff eight months ago.

 ?I was shocked at the blatant manner in which my name was being used to pass a tender. How can a minister be expected to keep a watch on each and every phone call that is made from his or her secretariat?? he asked.

 Sibal said he feared there might be more such incidents that may not have come to light and was surprised at the resistance from his staff to his decision to suspend Buta. ?I convened a meeting of my staff last Tuesday and asked them to maintain integrity.?

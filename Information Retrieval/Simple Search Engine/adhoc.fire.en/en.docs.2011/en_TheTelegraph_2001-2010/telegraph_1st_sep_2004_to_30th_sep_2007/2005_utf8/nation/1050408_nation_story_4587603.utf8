 Diabetes pill hope

 Mazumdar-Shaw: Magic cure?

 New Delhi, April 7: A pill for diabetics is just two to three years away ? if everything goes according to the plan that Biocon chief executive and India?s richest woman Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has drawn up.

 By the end of the year, Mazumdar-Shaw expects to file an application to investigate a new drug (INDA in pharmaceutical parlance) which would formally kick-start the process of developing a pill that could potentially free 32 million diabetics in India from the agony of regular insulin jabs.

 ?We hope to file the INDA by the end of this year. Clinical trials will begin early next year. It will, however, take two to three years before the drug hits the Indian market,? Mazumdar-Shaw, chairman and managing director of Biocon India, told The Telegraph.

 The pill is being developed in collaboration with Nobex of the US and is just one of several plans that Mazumdar-Shaw has devised to take the biotech company into the high risk but high rewards world of cutting-edge pharmaceutical research.

 The company, which launched its injectable insulin brand Insugen last year, has taken the competition to companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, aided by its low drug-development cost, a fraction of what the global majors have to spend.

 Developed over the last four years with an investment of nearly Rs 20 crore, Insugen has carved a new direction in the company?s growth strategy. Biocon has now emerged as a branded formulation player from a mere supplier of active pharma ingredients.

 While the domestic market for diabetes drugs is pegged at approximately Rs 220 crore, the size of the global market for such drugs is estimated to be Rs 22,000 crore.

 Biocon is also focusing on developing drugs to treat cancer. ?If everything goes well and we get a fast-track approval, then we might launch the drug early next year,? Mazumdar-Shaw said.

 In 2002, Biocon licensed a promising molecule ? Thera CIM (h-R3) ? from the Center of Molecular Immunology in Cuba. The pharma research major is at present testing the molecule for treating cancer of the neck and brain. 

 Biocon has five other oncology drugs in the pipeline, which include three vaccines to suppress relapses in cancer patients and two that target colon, breast and other forms of cancer.

 Biocon has been keen to branch into new areas even as it focuses on its core area of statins (cholesterol busting drugs). Statins currently account for about 60 per cent of the company?s overall revenues, but this is projected to recede when the other businesses start growing.

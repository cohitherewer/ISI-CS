 Jammu: The Border Security Force killed 

 five infiltrators along the Line of Control in Poonch district 

 on Tuesday, reports our correspondent. 

 The infiltrators opened fire when BSF jawans saw a group of around 12 militants and challenged them in the Acchar area of Mendhar, said Bansi Dhar Sharma, inspector-general of BSF, Jammu frontier.

 The five infiltrators died in the encounter that lasted for more than two hours. The others fled to the Pakistani side. A BSF jawan was injured in the encounter.

 SC piles judge pension heat

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has directed 

 all states and Union territories to implement the higher 

 pension scheme for judicial officers as recommended by the 

 Shetty commission, reports our legal correspondent.

 A three-judge bench of Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti and Justices N. Santosh Hegde and Y.K. Sabharwal on Monday rejected an argument of most states that they were facing a ?financial crunch?. The bench ruled that ?not even minor deviation? from the commission?s recommendation would be allowed.

 The judges warned that if states and Union Territories do not comply with the order within 12 weeks, it would be ?viewed seriously? and the court would summon chief secretaries concerned to appear in person and give an explanation.

 Amicus curiae in the case Fali Nariman told the court that the higher pension scheme has been implemented without change by Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. 

 Some states told the Supreme Court that their respective pension rules allow only a certain hike. The bench then directed them to amend the rules ?wherever necessary? to execute the scheme in ?letter and spirit?.

 The court also directed the Meghalaya government to initiate the process for separation of judiciary from the executive, which discharges judicial work in some Northeast states.

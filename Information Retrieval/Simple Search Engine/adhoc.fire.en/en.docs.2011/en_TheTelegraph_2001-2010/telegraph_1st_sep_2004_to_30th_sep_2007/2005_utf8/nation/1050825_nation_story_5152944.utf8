 Singh shuffle on hold

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: The much-awaited cabinet revamp, which was to take place after the monsoon session of Parliament, has been put off again.

 Government sources cited Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs excessively busy schedule as the main reason for postponing the exercise. 

 But Congress sources said the shuffle/expansion has got bogged down on the question whether it should be major or minor and, if the former, how major it should be.

 They said while Singh wants an overhaul of sorts, Congress president Sonia Gandhi favours a cautious approach, which would not claim the heads of senior ministers.

 The other hitch, they said, was accommodating aspirants from the Congress from both the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. A conservative count puts their number at 25.

 Singh leaves for Kabul on August 28 and returns the following day. He takes off for Lucknow on September 1 for an official event. On September 2 and 3, he will be in Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram.

 The sources said apart from gracing a health-related meeting on alternative medicine, Singh might announce sops for Tamil Nadu in keeping with the promises of the common minimum programme. The CMP had promised to install desalination plants along the Coromandel coast starting with Chennai.

 Tamil Nadu goes to polls next year, as does Kerala. But the Prime Ministers Kerala agenda is still not known.

 After he returns from the south, Singh will be preoccupied with the European Union summit in the capital on September 7 and 8. The sources said Singh is unlikely to make the cabinet-related changes between September 4 and 6 amid preparations for the EU summit.

 Singh leaves for Paris on September 10 for a bilateral visit before heading to New York to attend the UN General Assembly. He will return to Delhi on September 16 or 17.

 If the Election Commission announces the Bihar election dates, the revamp could be postponed yet again.

 HIV kids back in class

 Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 4: Two HIV-positive siblings in Kerala broke free from their segregated classroom and shared a bench with their classmates on Thursday, crowning a sustained rights campaign victory by voluntary groups.

 No frowns or sneers greeted Akshara, 8, and brother Ananthu, 6, as they hurried to classes after the morning assembly at Sree Narayana Lower Primary School at Kottiyur in the northern district of Kannur.

 Atul Mohan and Ajil Satheesh, cousins who had shared the siblings? separate classroom, also joined them.

 Their expulsion from the school had hit the headlines in July last year after fear gripped parents that other students might get infected through merely touching the siblings or by sharing common school facilities with them.

 Back in school, Akshara was a little sad and said she would miss special teacher K. Vinod Kumar who had cared for them during their quarantine over the past six months. 

 She is in Class II and Ananthu is in Class I as are also Atul and Ajil. 

 The district collector?s order to disband the separate classroom and send the children back to regular school followed a threat by activists of Science Vision, an NGO, to start an indefinite fast in front of the Kannur collectorate from January 14.

 Science Vision chief Mohandas, who is Atul?s father, said the threat was made to pressurise the school management, which delayed the readmission of the siblings fearing mass migration by the other students. This would have led to a fall in class strength, affecting the prospects of the teachers.

 Akshara and Ananthu had lost their father, Shaji, to AIDS in June 2003. By then, his children ? barring eldest daughter Aathira ? and their mother, K. Rema, were infected with the virus. 

 On learning that the children had tested positive, the school asked Akshara to keep off for some time and later cited her prolonged absence to strike her off the rolls.

 Ananthu, in a government-run kindergarten, was deserted by all but one of his playmates.

 Last year, Rema led her children to the state capital and staged a sit-in in front of the secretariat, demanding her children?s right to study at the local school.

 Then chief minister A.K. Antony ordered their readmission but the parents cried foul. As a compromise, the government set up a separate classroom under a special teacher.

 Science Vision and the Kerala Shastra Sahitya Parishad, a progressive science movement, then stepped up their campaign for ending the segregation. ?After all, no other kid in the school or the kindergarten where Akshara studied got the infection, convincing the people of the fallacy of their fears,? Mohan said.

 The parents soon shed their inhibitions. They paid for the electrification of Rema?s house and bought her a television set.

 Rema has a regular income from working as a ?positive speaker? at the Kerala AIDS Control Society?s Nava Jyothy Home for sex workers. Her daughter Aathira is in Class VII at a private school.

 The local chapter of Y?s Men?s International, a social organisation, has announced it will host the family at the house of a member every month.

 PM puts trade carrot before neighbours

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Three weeks before the Saarc summit in Dhaka, the Prime Minister is pushing for more pro-active trade ties with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar so that they can benefit from Indias economic growth.

 Our neighbours must acquire a greater stake in our economic growth by benefiting from it, Manmohan Singh told a meeting of the trade and economic relations committee yesterday. India must be willing to import more from our neighbours, especially the less developed economies.

 The statement of intent, expected to be conveyed loud and clear at the Dhaka summit, is aimed at easing the recent political tensions with Bangladesh over issues such as cross-border killings, immigration and export-import imbalances.

 All bilateral relations are political and economic. Any improvement in political relations impinges on economic relations and vice versa, Singhs media adviser Sanjaya Baru explained.

 Baru said certain major decisions taken by the committee would form the bedrock of good neighbourliness:

 A free trade agreement (FTA) and comprehensive economic co-operation agreement (CECA) Delhi has clinched with Sri Lanka and Singapore, respectively;

 An India-Asean FTA;

 The South Asian FTA;

 An India-Gulf co-operation council FTA (which the committee emphasised must be implemented fast);

 Proposals for FTAs with Korea and Israel and an Indo-Mauritius CECA.

 From the Malaccan Straits to the Gulf countries, these treaties and agreements span all our neighbours, except China, Baru said. He held them up as the governments most important achievement of the last six months, when the committee was formed with the Prime Minister as its chairman.

 Asked why China has been excluded, Baru said: Indias trade relationship with China has spiralled over the last four or five years. We dont need to do more to increase it. The market takes care of this relationship and the government does not need to do much on it.

 He singled out Bangladesh as the country most meriting greater economic engagement, pointing out that the trade deficit was huge: while Indias exports total $1.2 billion, its imports from Bangladesh are worth only $50 million.

 Delhi reckons that an increased trade engagement will encourage Dhaka to ease transit rights to India, which could benefit the Northeast. Baru suggested Bangladesh could take the initiative to sell gas to India. Delhi, he said, is looking at importing more textiles and jute products: the Food Corporation of India will buy jute bags from Bangladesh.

 Myanmar is keen to export pulses and wood while Pakistan has textiles and molasses on its radar. During his last Indian trip, President Pervez Musharraf had proposed to Singh that Delhi import molasses in wagons rather than barrels, making bulk imports possible. Singh had asked the food ministry to look into the matter.

 At the committee meeting, Singh is believed to have cited how fast Pakistan had four-laned the Lahore-Wagah road and said India, too, should get cracking.

 Delhi also hopes that Islamabad would ease restrictions on transit to Afghanistan so that reconstruction projects can move faster.

 Officials said the Saarc summit is expected to decide on whether to take Afghanistan on board.

 Singhs enlarged vision doesnt end with the neighbours. On President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams initiative, the government will start a project to bridge the digital divide in Africa and facilitate tele-education and tele-medicine across 53 member countries of the African union.

 Christened the pan-African network project, it will enable India to share its expertise in the diverse areas of information technology and satellite technology, education and health care, Baru said. The Prime Ministers Office is monitoring the projects progress.

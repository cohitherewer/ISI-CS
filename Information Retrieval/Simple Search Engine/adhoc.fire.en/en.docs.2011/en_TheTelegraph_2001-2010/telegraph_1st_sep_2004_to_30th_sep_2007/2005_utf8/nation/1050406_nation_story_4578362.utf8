The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Travel bandh on Friday

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 5: Air-India?s loss had been gain for Lufthansa or British Airways for the past few days.

 Not anymore.

 With Air-India deciding to slash commission rates from 7 to 5 per cent from May 1, travel agents, after a meeting in Mumbai today, decided to not only call a travel bandh on Friday but also boycott a major European airline from the same day.

 ?The airline, which has connectivity to major destinations around the world from India, also played a major role in influencing Air-India?s decision. We have, therefore, taken a unanimous decision to boycott ticket sales for the airline from Friday onwards,? said Zakkir Ahmed, the all-India president of the Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Air-India, which is trying to enter the elite Star Alliance of leading global airlines, has decided to stick to its decision. ?There is no question of any reconciliation from our end because what we are offering the agents is good enough,? said Jeetendra Bhargava, director, public relations.

 But with foreign airlines also getting affected, things could change dramatically in the next few days. ?We had a meeting between all the travel agents? associations and we have unanimously decided to remain closed on Friday,? Balbir Mayal, president of the Travel Agents? Association of India, said from Mumbai.

 This means anyone planning to buy a ticket on Friday to any place in the country or abroad will be in for a surprise as no tickets will be issued by the agents. The boycott would bring to a halt daily transactions of over Rs 50 crore.

 In Calcutta, travel agents, who number between 700 and 800, have put up posters outside offices saying: ?Sorry, we don?t sell Air-India tickets.? But that has not stopped customers from coming to them. ?We are offering attractive prices on other airlines that go to all Air-India destinations. The fares we are offering seem to have gone down well with the people,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (eastern region) of the travel agents? federation.

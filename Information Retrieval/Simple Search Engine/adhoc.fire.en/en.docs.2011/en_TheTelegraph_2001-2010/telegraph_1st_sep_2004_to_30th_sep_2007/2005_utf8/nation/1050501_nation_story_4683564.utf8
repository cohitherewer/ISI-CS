 Calcutta, April 30: ICC Super Series in Australia, October 2005 ? MAX. India vs Pakistan in Pakistan, January 2006 ? Ten Sports. ICC Champions Trophy in India, September 2006 ? MAX. India vs Sri Lanka vs South Africa in Sri Lanka, November 2006 ? Ten Sports. ICC World Cup in the West Indies, February 2007 ? MAX.

 The balance of power, as far as the cricket beam goes, has shifted ? at least for the next two years. If Team India telecast is what matters, Ten Sports and MAX have beaten ESPN-STAR Sports by an innings and some.

 Be it India?s immediate next outing in Sri Lanka, the high-profile Pakistan visit, the innovative Super Series or the World Cup, most of the prime cricket content is divided between Ten and MAX, the two channels recently united on the distribution platform One Alliance.

 ?We have got the channels together knowing the content they have,? says Anuj Gandhi, senior vice-president (sales and marketing) of One Alliance, which also distributes channels such as Discovery, AXN, MTV, Nick and NDTV.

 ?As far as cricket is concerned, it really boils down to who has what over the next two years and the two channels dovetail each other very well with their content,? Gandhi says.

 The Dubai-based Ten Sports has the rights to all cricket played in Sharjah, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the West Indies and Morocco till 2008 while MAX has rights to the ICC tournaments up to 2007, including the World Cup. ?MAX reflects the two biggest passions for India ? movies and cricket ? and we have pitched for the best in both,? claims Albert Almeida, business head of MAX.

 ?When we started out, there was very little cricket content featuring India that was up for sale. But over the years, we have managed to acquire as much content relevant to the Indian viewer as possible,? says Ten Sports managing director Sharmista Rijhwani. ?And Indian cricket is what makes the business model for sports channels viable.?

 ESPN-STAR Sports steps out to the challenge. ?We have more than double the number of days of Indian cricket than Ten and rights to six cricket-playing nations,? counters Himanshu Verma, director, corporate communications for ESPN-STAR Sports. ?Besides, there are several series in India rights to which are still open.?

 But with Team India almost constantly on tour in the next 24 months and the telecast rights fiasco getting more complicated by the week, the prospects of the few home matches raking in the moolah have dimmed and hopes of broadcasters beaming the away tournaments have brightened.

 One Alliance is all set to leverage the ?killer combination? to get results on the ground. ?We are trying to reach agreements with cable operators for the next two years to ensure that there are no switch-offs,? says Gandhi.

 The last-mile operators would only be game because of what the Ten-MAX combination would be bringing to cable homes ? Team India cricket and more cricket.

 The channels are drawing up mega promotion plans for the action ahead. ?World Cup as a format is well established, but Super Series is a novelty,? says Almeida. 

 In the Super Series, Australia takes on Rest of the World for three ODIs and a six-day Test. ?So our build-up will start from May when the Super Selectors, including Sunil Gavaskar, Richard Hadlee, Clive Lloyd and Michael Atherton, start picking the teams,? says Almeida.

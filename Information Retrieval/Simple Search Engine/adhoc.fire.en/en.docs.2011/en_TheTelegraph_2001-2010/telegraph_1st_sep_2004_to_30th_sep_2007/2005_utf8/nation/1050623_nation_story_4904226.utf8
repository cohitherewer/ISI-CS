 NRI university on cards

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, June 22: A special university for non-resident Indians and persons of Indian origin (PIO) is on the agenda of the ministry for overseas Indian affairs. 

 Officials in the ministry believe the idea could see the light of day in as soon as two months.

 While most places where Indians are settled have good facilities up to the high-school stage, many Indians living abroad have to face disappointments when it comes to higher education, Jagdish Tytler, minister of state for overseas Indian affairs, said. 

 The move, though, is being seen by many as another attempt by the Centre to win over the fairly well-off Indian community living abroad and to get them to invest more in India. 

 Some of the PIOs have expressed the desire that their children receive Indian education from Indian teachers and the ministry sees this as a vindication of the high standards maintained by the Indian education system, said a senior ministry official. Indians abroad also want their children to be enriched by Indian culture, the official added.

 Talks have begun with the human resource development ministry and the overseas Indian affairs ministry described HRD minister Arjun Singhs response as very positive.

 Officials of the newly-created ministry believe the financial success of Indian students, like the alumni from IITs and IIMs, is largely responsible for NRIs and PIOs wanting Indian higher education for their wards.

 At present, while NRIs have a small quota in internationally-reputed Indian institutes, PIOs, who do not possess Indian citizenship, are not even eligible for this quota.

 The ministry does not foresee many roadblocks in the university initiative as the government is not expected to fund it. Several prominent NRIs have apparently agreed to put their money in the endeavour.

 All they want is that we should help them set up high-quality facilities for higher education. They want Indian teachers and they want the university to be recognised in India, Tytler said.

 Around 25 million people of Indian origin live abroad. According to the Reserve Bank of India, in 2004, NRIs and PIOs sent $332.7 billion to India.

 The ministry also reiterated its intention of soon establishing an Overseas Indian Centre in New Delhi. The land for the Overseas Indian Centre has been obtained, Tytler said.

 Azad exit sets up shuffle

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: The exit of Ghulam Nabi Azad to Jammu and Kashmir has set the stage for a cabinet shuffle and a revamp of the Congresss top executive bodies.

 Azad holds two portfolios in the Union ministry: parliamentary affairs and urban development. With the winter session of Parliament due from November 22, the changes, on hold for the past few months, must take place soon.

 Officials said the shuffle will happen between November 5 and 10 ? that is, after Id and before the Prime Minister leaves for Dhaka on November 11 to attend the Saarc summit.

 The core Friday group ? made up of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, her political secretary Ahmed Patel, home minister Shivraj Patil, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and Azad ? met this evening at the Prime Ministers residence, ostensibly to bid Azad farewell. But they also discussed cabinet and party changes, sources said.

 Information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy could be shifted to urban development with his current job going to party general secretary Ambika Soni.

 It is uncertain who will get parliamentary affairs but the favourite seems to be water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who was the Congresss chief whip during the National Democratic Alliance regime. Das Munshi, party sources said, has been asking for an additional ministry.

 The other vacancies are in the ministries of coal, sports and youth affairs, and overseas affairs, previously held by Shibu Soren, Sunil Dutt and Jagdish Tytler.

 Sonia is also considering nominating members to the party working committee, despite her preference for having elected members, in the face of a clamour from the newly elected All India Congress Committee (AICC) members.

 AICC members are supposed to elect 12 of the 24 working committee members at the party plenary session. But a deferred plenary is expected only in the third week of January, and many AICC members have made an emphatic representation to Sonia to form the working committee through nominations.

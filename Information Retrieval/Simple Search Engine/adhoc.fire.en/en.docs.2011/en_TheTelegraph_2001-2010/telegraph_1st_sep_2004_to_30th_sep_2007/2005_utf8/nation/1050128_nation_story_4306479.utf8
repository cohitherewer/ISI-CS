 Whisky with glass pieces

 New Delhi (PTI): A consumer court ordered 

 the Delhi Tourism Development Corporation to pay compensation 

 to a man who found glass pieces in a sealed whisky bottle 

 he had bought at a retail outlet of the corporation.

 ?The opposite parties (DTDC, its retail outlet along with Patiala Distillers and Manufacturers Ltd) had exposed the complainant to health hazard by selling such kind of bottle,? the district consumer disputes redressal forum (north Delhi) said.

 ?Broken pieces of glass were lying at the bottom of the bottle which was visible to the naked eye. It is thus a clear case of sale of whisky which is not fit for sale and was in fact a health hazard,? the court added.

 The court ordered the parties to pay Rs 30, the price of a quarter bottle of whisky, Rs 5,000 as compensation and Rs 500 as litigation costs.

 Sanjay Kumar, a resident of Ambedkar Vihar, said he bought the Winner brand of whisky on April 10, 2003, from the corporation outlet at Gokhala market.

 DTDC and the others denied negligence on their part and claimed that Kumar did not furnish any proof of the purchase. The court rejected their claim as the findings were made after inspecting the bottle produced before it.

 Probe after Pappu jail threat 

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Jan. 9: Bihar prison minister Raghavendra Pratap Singh today ordered a probe into the alleged threat episode at Beur Central Jail featuring Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav.

 The government has also deputed a magistrate in the jail to take stock of the situation. Yesterday, Pappu Yadav allegedly threatened jailer Bhola Singh and other staff members with dire consequences for their refusal to allow some visitors to meet him. 

 ?Inspector-general (prisons) Deepak Kumar Singh will submit the report tomorrow, following which I will take action,? the jail minister said here. The IG (prisons) is understood to have asked the superintendent of Beur Jail, Dilip Kumar Singh, to furnish a detailed report.

 The jailer was allegedly mobbed by Pappu Yadav?s supporters outside the prison who held him hostage for over an hour for not allowing them inside. Bhola Singh somehow managed to contact the district magistrate as well as the senior superintendent of police, who immediately sent a force and an official to bring the situation under control.

 An angry Pappu Yadav then allegedly reminded the staff of the ?fate? of former jailer Nagendra Singh, who was killed, and threatened Bhola Singh with dire consequences. Later, Dilip Kumar Singh brought the incident to the notice of the jail department.

 Magistrate Umakant, deputed by the government today, said: ?I?m here to inspect security measures on the jail premises. The situation is under control. If any discrepancy is found, I will report it to the district administration and other officials concerned.?

 Pappu Yadav, accused in the murder of CPM leader Ajit Sarkar, is likely to be shifted to a jail outside Bihar. The Supreme Court has taken strong exception to his ways inside the prison and the CBI has suggested to the court that the politician be shifted to a jail outside Bihar. 

 A list of six jails ? in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat ? has also been submitted to the apex court in this regard. 

 Last month, Pappu Yadav held a ?durbar? inside the prison in violation of the jail manual. Besides, a raid on the jail ? ordered by the high court ? revealed that the MP used a mobile phone to call up ministers and senior state officials.

 On Friday, Pappu Yadav allegedly held another ?durbar? with his supporters on the banks of the Ganges while being taken to a local court for hearing.

 Modi punches back at rivals

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 20: It was Narendra Modis turn to show his strength.

 Four days after his rivals regrouped in Gandhinagar to renew their campaign to oust him, the beleaguered Gujarat chief minister chose a public function organised by the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority to parade his popularity.

 Local BJP legislator and state home minister Amit Shah had been assigned the job of mobilising a huge crowd for the function. It was attended by party chief L.K. Advani, who has backed Modi whenever the dissidents have raised questions about the chief ministers style of functioning.

 At the function, too, Advani praised Modi for sound governance.

 On Tuesday, the rebel MLAs had raised anti-Modi slogans at Keshubhai Patels residence and urged the former chief minister to lead their campaign. To counter that, Modi loyalists were today seen carrying banners that read: Modi, you march ahead, we are with you.

 The dissidents were present at the function but only to follow protocol. The rebels have already made it clear they would not meet Advani to air their grievances during his two-day visit to the state.

 Sources said Modi would try to drum up public support when Advani attends functions in a village in Patan district and in Gandhinagar tomorrow.

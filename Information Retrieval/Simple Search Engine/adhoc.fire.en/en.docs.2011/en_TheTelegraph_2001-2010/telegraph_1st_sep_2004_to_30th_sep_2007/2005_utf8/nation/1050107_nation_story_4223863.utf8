The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Scramble for skeleton clue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Agartala, Jan. 6: The Tripura home department 

today began going through all records of security deployment at the chief minister?s 

residence since 1990 in an attempt to unravel the mystery behind the sensational 

discovery of skeletal remains of a woman inside a septic tank there.

 Samples of the remains will be sent to the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics in Hyderabad and the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Calcutta to ascertain the victim?s age, time of death and other details. A police official said the samples would be despatched after being ?processed?.

 Workers of the Agartala Municipal Council found the skeletal remains while cleaning the septic tank on Tuesday. 

 Hemant Kumar Pratihari, the chief scientist at the forensic laboratory in Agartala, said that ?nothing definite? could be said about the remains until comprehensive tests were conducted at the laboratories in Hyderabad and Calcutta.

 Sources in the home department said the investigation was focusing on identifying the security personnel who were deployed at the chief minister?s residence since 1990. 

 The tank where the skeletal remains were found is connected to a toilet adjacent to the house meant for security personnel and other members of the chief minister?s staff. 

 The sprawling campus has two buildings and a number of security sheds. 

 Apart from police and Tripura State Rifles personnel, a unit of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary had been deployed there in 1990. The main bungalow was then occupied by Surajit Dutta, who was the public works department minister in the Congress-Tripura Upajati Juba Samity coalition government. The then chief minister, Sudhir Ranjan Mazumder, chose to stay in his private residence.

 ?The skeleton apparently cannot be as old as 15 years, but we do not want to leave anything to chance. That is the reason why we are poring over old records of security deployment at the chief minister?s residence. These could come in handy during the course of investigation,? a senior official said.

 State Congress vice-president Tapas De demanded that chief minister Manik Sarkar be arrested, while the state unit of the BJP questioned the efficacy of security arrangements at the residence. 

 ?The fact that skeletal remains have been found in such a high-security zone as the chief minister?s official residence is shocking,? state BJP president Ranajay Deb said.

 The Left Front government yesterday decided to hand over the case to the CBI after initially announcing a CID probe. 

 Sarkar is understood to have taken the decision after consulting his colleagues in the Left Front and senior police officials.

 A section of the Opposition criticised the move, contending that the CBI was already overburdened and a judicial inquiry by a sitting high court judge would have been more appropriate.

 The CBI had earlier failed to crack the conspiracy behind the assassination of BJP leader Shyamhari Sharma while he was addressing an election meeting in the heart of the capital on November 13, 1991.

 Rape MMS clip cry

 New Delhi, Nov. 20 (PTI): More than the MMS sex clip and the blackmail, the surprise lay in the victim: a man in his 20s.

 An MBA working with ICICI Bank has alleged he was sexually assaulted by a male friend and two other men who shot an MMS video clip of the attack and blackmailed him by threatening to circulate it.

 Police sources said the victim, who is from Shamli in Uttar Pradesh, has alleged he was severely beaten when he protested.

 According to the victim, the friend ? a share broker named Sharma ? had taken him to a house in south Delhis Srinivaspuri earlier this week, saying he had been invited to a party and wanted the victim to come along.

 Two other men joined them there and they all had a few drinks. Suddenly, Sharma and the two others attacked him. The victim said he had already paid the blackmailers Rs 30,000.

 A senior police officer, however, said the bank employee had lodged a complaint that he was beaten up but did not mention a sexual assault.

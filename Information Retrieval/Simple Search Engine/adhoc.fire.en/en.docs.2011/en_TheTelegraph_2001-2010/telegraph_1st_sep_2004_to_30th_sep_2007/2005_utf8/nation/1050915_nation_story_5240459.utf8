 Left seeks say in trade talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept 14: The Left parties, the Congress-led governments most significant allies, will use their leverage with the Centre to highlight what they believe are issues critical to the WTO talks.

 They had earlier submitted a note to the government outlining their position on subjects the world trade body has been discussing.

 Last week, the Centre said: Our approach to the talks is being dictated by our national interests, especially our concerns for the millions of farmers who are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. It is also our objective to stimulate economic growth and development through export of goods and services.

 Yesterday, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said: We want to start discussions with the government on WTO negotiations. We have identified the subjects of discussion.

 The Left parties, which were opposed to the WTO in the past, now want to play a role in shaping the terms of the negotiations. They played a part in drawing up the provisions of the Patents Amendment Act and held several rounds of discussions with senior Congress ministers to thrash out a document acceptable to both.

 The Left parties want to use their influence at the Centre to send the message that they can make a difference in major policies. This is what they claimed after the patents act was passed ? that it was their persistence that made the government come up with a draft better than the one prepared by the previous regime.

 In their note to the government, the Left said: Before agreeing to any tariff reduction, there should be substantial reduction in all forms of subsidies granted by the US and the EU. India should mobilise G20 and G33 countries to ensure that the US and the EU are prevented from granting subsidies at the high levels they were doing.

 The Centre responded, saying: India has been seeking to secure its negotiating objectives in agriculture through strategic alliances such as the G20 and G33.

 The government says its objective is to protect the countrys low-income and resource poor farmers and agricultural landless labourers.

 It has reminded the Left that the G20 has consistently taken an aggressive stance against the high volumes of trade distorting support which continues to be provided by three major subsidisers ? the EU, the US and Japan.

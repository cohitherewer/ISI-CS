 Parched villagers turn to Naxalites 

 JOY SENGUPTA

 Ranchi, June 5: Their hopes 

 fast drying up, the residents of a cluster of parched villages 

 in Latehar have rushed to the red brigade to get them water. 

 Enraged with the administration for not paying heed to their requests, the inhabitants of eight villages in Balumath block of Latehar, 70 km from Ranchi, have asked the extremists to help them arrange for water. Sources said a formal application was handed over to the extremist cadre at a public meeting a couple of days ago. 

 Among the villages that have asked for help are Heranj, Balubhung, Murpa and Phulsu. There are more than 30 small and big villages in Balumath, a Naxalite-dominated area in Latehar.

 An official at the Latehar police station said: Yes, we have got this information. It is a fact that there is a severe water crisis in the Balumath area. Most of the wells and ponds have dried up. The villagers have requested them to help them dig a few wells. A formal application has been sent. 

 The sources said repeated requests to the district administration to ensure adequate supply of water had fallen on deaf ears. Ever since the onset of summer, the villagers put in several requests for timely action. But none was taken. Even now, the condition is the same. Under such circumstances, the villagers do not have any option but to go to the Naxalites, said a resident.

 The sources said on Friday, that the rebels organised a public meeting at Balumath. People from many villages travelled miles to attend the rally. All the villagers joined hands and requested the rebels to take some steps in order to improve the deteriorating condition. They were assured of immediate action, he said.

 The police passed on the responsibility to the district administration, saying it was not a law and order problem. We dont have anything to do with this. How can we ensure water to the masses? Balumath is a Naxalite hotbed and meetings like these take place every now and then. It is a civic problem and the responsibility is with the Latehar district administration, said a police official.

 The sources said the villagers had requested the Naxalites not to stop government officials from holding surveys in the area. They are still hopeful that the officials will do something. Government officials do come down for surveys, but each time they are forced to return after being warned, said a resident. 

 Latehar deputy commissioner K.K Sone admitted there was a water crisis. Yes, there is a water problem. Many hand pumps are out of order. I have given instructions to the block development officer to get them repaired.

 Sone said the administration had written to the public health and engineering department. But we do not have any information on whether the villagers have approached the Naxalites to help them, he said.

 Bad times for Kaal

 - Notice 

 for violating wildlife act 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 29: Bollywood has entered the summer release season desperate for a hit, but one of the films it has its hopes pinned on is already feeling the heat.

 The Karan Johar-Shahrukh Khan 

 produced Kaal (picture shows a poster of the film) 

 ran into legal trouble today, with the Supreme Court issuing 

 notices to the producers and the Centre for violating the 

 wildlife act. 

 Amicus curiae Harish Salve told a bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal, S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia that the film, which was released today, was shot in locations in the protected area of Jim Corbett National Park. 

 The bench also issued notice to Uttaranchal where the national park is located. 

 Salve contended that the shooting of the film took place ?in gross violation? of the wildlife act and prevention of cruelty to animals act. He sought a directive to impose ?exemplary damages? on the film?s producers as it was shot without necessary permissions either from the central government or the authorities concerned.

 Salve sought an order asking the Centre to initiate appropriate action after investigating the matter and submit a report to the court.

 The film stars Ajay Devgan, Vivek Oberoi, John Abraham, Isha Deol and Lara Dutta. 

 The court will also look into whether there was any cruelty to the animals such lions, tigers and eagles that performed in the film.

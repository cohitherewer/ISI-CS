 Tandon accused in sari stampede

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 11: The sari tragedy in the run-up to last year?s general elections has returned to haunt the Uttar Pradesh BJP just as it was trying to put its house together and take on the Mulayam Singh Yadav government.

 About 10 months ago, 22 women and a child were crushed in a stampede when saris were being distributed free during then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s election rally here.

 The incident was exhumed late last month when a new chargesheet was filed in a subdivisional judicial magistrate?s court. The chargesheet names Vajpayee?s aide Lalji Tandon as a key accused. 

 Tandon?s name had not figured in a chargesheet filed earlier. His name appeared in an FIR in a separate case, but it was deleted in the course of investigation.

 Tandon, an MLA, has now been accused of bribing voters and ?trying to influence voters in favour of BJP candidate and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?.

 Two organisers of the programme on Tandon?s birthday ? Brajendra Murari Yadav and Manoj Singh ? are members of the Nagrik Seva Samiti, a BJP affiliate, and have been charged along with the BJP leader.

 The chargesheet has drawn evidence from witnesses and newspaper clippings announcing the programme in which saris were to be distributed among the poor women of the locality. The model code of conduct for the elections was already in force by then.

 It also says the organisers failed to get permission for the programme at a park near the Gol Market area of the city. Tandon was present when the stampede occurred and left soon after.

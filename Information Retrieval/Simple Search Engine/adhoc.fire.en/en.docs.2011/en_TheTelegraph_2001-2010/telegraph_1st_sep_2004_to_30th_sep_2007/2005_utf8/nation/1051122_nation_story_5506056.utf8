 Big-bang city facelift plan

 Renewal road

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: Come December 3 and India will be ready to start spending Rs 100,000 crore to give its cities better roads and transport, cheaper housing and cleaner slums.

 The Manmohan Singh government has cleared one of its most ambitious projects, the National Urban Renewal Mission, that will look to improve the quality of life in 60 cities with a million-plus population, including all state capitals. A few other towns with religious or historical interest or tourism potential will also benefit.

 The money will be provided jointly by the Centre, state governments and civic bodies.

 The seven-year scheme will focus on infrastructure ? which can mean anything from road repairs and new flyovers to an underground railway ? and basic services to the poor, such as housing and improved slum sanitation.

 The mission will also try to streamline the way civic bodies manage and govern cities and boost economic development.

 The scheme will be guided by a national steering group chaired by the urban development minister and co-chaired by the minister of state for urban employment and poverty alleviation. It shall have two sub-missions, one for infrastructure and governance and the other for basic services to the urban poor.

 Under the scheme, civic bodies will strive to improve their finances and creditworthiness and try and get the public to participate in their functioning. To ensure that the new infrastructure or services do not languish over time, the mission will try to improve their operation and maintenance.

 Critics, however, say that for all its talk of pushing the municipal model, the Centre has retained a firm grip over the flow of funds.

 There is nothing new except the name. These are all part of the urban reform agenda being followed over the last five to six years, said town planner and School of Planning and Architecture faculty member Geeta Dewan Verma.

 The government has also approved two other schemes ? an infrastructure development scheme for small and medium-sized towns and an integrated housing and slum development programme for cities not covered by the mission.

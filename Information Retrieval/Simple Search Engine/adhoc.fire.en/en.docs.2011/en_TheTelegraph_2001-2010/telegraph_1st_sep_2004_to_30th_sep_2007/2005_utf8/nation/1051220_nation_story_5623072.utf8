 ESPN in court on telecast rights

 Calcutta: Sports broadcaster ESPN STAR Sports has moved Delhi High Court challenging the information and broadcasting ministrys guidelines for downlinking that makes it mandatory for private channels to share telecast rights of national and international sports events with Doordarshan, says a staff reporter.

 The high court has issued notices to the ministries of information and broadcasting and sports, and Prasar Bharati on the petition filed by ESPN and asked them to file replies by January 18, the next date of hearing. 

 It, however, refused to grant an interim stay to restrain the government from acting on the guidelines.

 According to the Centres guidelines, all sports content will have to be shared with Doordarshan. In case of cricket, this includes all matches featuring India and extends to even tournaments for which rights have been bought prior to the issuance of the guidelines.

 A suitable friendship

 Vajpayee: Sherwani ahead

New Delhi, April 17: Busy fighting a war within, Atal Bihari Vajpayee will be glad to know that a general who once pushed him into a bloody battle will not return without looking up a friend won during a peace offensive.

 On Pervez Musharraf?s insistence, the external affairs ministry has departed from protocol and arranged a meeting between the Pakistan President and the former Indian Prime Minister.

 The general will call on Vajpayee at his residence tomorrow before he leaves for the Philippines.

 The Pakistan high commission had put in a request for Musharraf to meet Vajpayee. When the ministry indicated that it might not be possible, a second request was made, which could not be turned down.

 Ten days ago, a tailor was sent to take Vajpayee?s measurements because the general wished to gift him a sherwani. 

 Many believe that Musharraf is going out of his way to be courteous to Vajpayee despite the abortive Agra summit because of the widespread belief that it was the former Prime Minister who went against the sentiments of his party and the RSS to repair bilateral relations.

 The latest meeting is also taking place at a time when Vajpayee is under attack from RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan. 

 Vajpayee had taken the peace initiative in spite of the memories of Kargil ? Musharraf was the Pakistan army chief during that conflict ? Agra and the attack on Parliament.

 In early 2003, Vajpayee put the ?peace process? in motion ? first by publicly stating that it took two hands to clap, and then declaring in a rally in Srinagar that India was prepared to extend a hand of friendship to Pakistan.

 Islamabad reciprocated the gesture by promising not to allow its territory to be used for terrorist activities.

 Musharraf echoed Vajpayee when he spoke at a banquet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hosted last night. ?It needs two hands to clap. They say it takes two to tango, we may be too old to tango but my hand is extended to clap.? 

 Vajpayee may have been isolated within the parivar when Agra happened. This time round, he has L.K. Advani for company.

 The BJP president, who initially wanted to invite the general to dinner, called on him in his hotel. Advani, who is also facing the flak from the RSS chief, has accepted Musharraf?s invitation to visit Pakistan. He would do so in June.

 Musharraf told Advani that he should also visit Karachi, where the BJP leader was born. 

 Musharraf, who on more than one occasion had insinuated that Advani had aborted the Agra peace effort, discussed Kashmir with him today. 

 According to Advani, the general?s view was ?mutual intransigence? was the root cause of the ?problem? while his theory was it was ?mutual mistrust?.

 Common test poser to Centre

New Delhi: To streamline admission to professional colleges 

throughout the country and avoid litigation every academic year, the Supreme Court 

on Tuesday asked the Centre and the University Grants Commission (UGC) why a common 

all-India entrance exam should not be held for the purpose, reports our legal 

correspondent.

 A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and P.P. Naolekar issued notices to the Centre and UGC and sought their responses within two weeks. The notices came on a petition filed by the All India Medical and Engineering Colleges Association seeking permission to conduct a unified entrance test for management quota seats.

 The bench said that on receiving a response from the Centre and the UGC, it would consider transferring the petition to a Constitution bench as a decision on the management quota issue was pending before a larger bench.

 Currently, states conduct separate entrance tests for filling management quota seats in private medical and engineering colleges. But the managements of these institutions want to conduct the tests themselves. 

 The petitioner sought a direction for conducting a common entrance test for the management quota seats as several seats remained vacant last year due to anomalies in the procedure of the test conducted by the consortium of private medical colleges.

 SC stays Andhra projects

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a notice to 

the Andhra Pradesh government in the Rs 26,000-crore ?irrigation projects scam? 

and continued its stay on the high court order that had allowed short-listed contractors 

to carry on with their work, reports our legal correspondent.

 These contractors were said to have been allotted tenders for some of the 21 projects of the 26 involved.

 A division bench of Justices D.M. Dharmadhikari and A.K. Mathur also issued notices to all the other parties, including contractors who had been allowed to continue work and those denied permission by the high court. The stay and the notices came on a petition filed by one Dolendra Prasad who challenged the December 6 order of the high court.

 The apex bench, which had on December 15 passed an interim stay on the high court order, fixed the second week of February for further hearing.

 Prasad had challenged before the high court the governments policy to divide all kinds of work, including irrigation and bridge construction, into projects worth Rs 26,000 crore and charged the state with ?doling out favours? to a chosen set of contractors.

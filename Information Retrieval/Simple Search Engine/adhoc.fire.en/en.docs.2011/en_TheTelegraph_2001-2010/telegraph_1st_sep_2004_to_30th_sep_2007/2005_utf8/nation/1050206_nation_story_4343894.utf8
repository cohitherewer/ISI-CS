 Anara to file cop slander suit 

Jammu (PTI): A day after police closed the porn CD case against 

Anara Gupta, the former Jammu beauty queen has decided to file a defamation suit 

against the police and the media.

 ?My client, Anara Gupta, will file defamation cases against police and a section of the media for defaming and falsely implicating her in the much-publicised porn CD case,? her lawyer Rahul Pant said. ?The amount to be claimed for defamation would be decided later,? he said.

 Following a forensic report from Hyderabad which made it clear that the pictures of the woman in the CD were not that of Anara, the crime branch of the state police on Friday asked Jammu and Kashmir High Court to permit them to close the case.

 Pant said they were awaiting the formal closure of the case before they could file the defamation case.

 ?At present, all the cases, including illegal confinement, permission to go to the National Human Rights Commission and porn CD cases are sub-judice and the court has demanded the status of Anara?s illegal confinement from October 24 to November 4 last year from state deputy general police Gopal Sharma by February 17,? Pant said.

 All details of ?defamatory? content given by TV news channels would be collected and they will also be sued, Pant added.

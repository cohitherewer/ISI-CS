 Man held for bid on judges life

 New Delhi (PTI): A disabled man who allegedly 

 tried to attack a judge with a knife inside her chamber 

 at the Patiala House courts on Friday has been arrested.

 Mohammad Saleem, who is bound to a wheelchair, said he was frustrated over the delay in getting compensation in a motor accident case. 

 I prefer to go to jail rather than live in penury, Saleem said after being arrested by the Tilak Marg police.

 Saleem entered the chamber of additional sessions judge and the chief of Delhi Legal Services Authority (DLSA), Sangita Dhingra Sehgal, around 11.45 am and began crying about his long-pending accident claim case. 

 He suddenly pulled out a knife concealed under his shirt and shouted main maar dunga ya mar jaaunga (I will kill or die). He was overpowered by the court staff, DLSA superintendent Dalip Madan said. 

 Saleem said he had suffered a serious leg injury in an accident in February 2004 following which he was forced to discontinue his job as a scrap collector. 

 Saleem, who is from Kanpur, said the DLSA had provided him a lawyer to fight his case in the accident claims tribunal. However, the matter had been dragging on for over a year and he was yet to receive any money.

 I wanted to get my plight highlighted. Now I know I will go to jail and thats what I wanted. It is better than living in penury or begging, Saleem said.

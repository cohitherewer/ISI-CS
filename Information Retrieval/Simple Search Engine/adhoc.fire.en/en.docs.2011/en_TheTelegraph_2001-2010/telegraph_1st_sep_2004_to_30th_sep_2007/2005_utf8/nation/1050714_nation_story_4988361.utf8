 Marble cements parties

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, July 13: When it comes to Taj Mahal, most political parties are more or less at one, unlike on the sensitive personal law.

 Parties on the left, centre and right of the political spectrum have contested the Wakf boards ownership claim on the Taj.

 Addressing its core constituency, the BJP has asked the Centre to intervene in the controversy, warning that complacency would encourage others to stake claim to monuments such as the Qutb Minar and Red Fort.

 This (the Wakf board decision) is a very wrong trend. This is definitely politically motivated. If the central government does not intervene, other such boards or people will start claiming ownership of the Qutb Minar, Red Fort and other historical monuments, said Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the BJP spokesperson.

 The Congress said the Taj is a national heritage monument. It should be the property of the whole country, said Anand Sharma, the party spokesperson.

 Sharma said the Congress would come out with a detailed statement soon.

 The Uttar Pradesh Congress, under attack for initially taking an ambiguous stand on the Imrana controversy, too, contested the Wakf boards decision.

 State party president Salman Khursheed said in a statement that the board was well within its rights to register properties fulfilling the required norms as Wakf property. But in the case of Taj Mahal, the ASI is providing much better security and maintenance, he said. 

 The CPM said monuments like the Taj should belong to the whole country. 

 It is a national property. The entire country feels proud of Taj Mahal. It ought not to be the property of any board or group, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said.

 Historian Irfan Habib termed the Wakf claim illegitimate. 

 Just because somebody makes a claim on the Taj does not mean that the monument should go to them, said Habib.

 Neither the Mughal empire nor the emperor who built the Taj is there any more. Who succeeds him as the custodian of the Wakf, who is legitimate is not clear, he added.

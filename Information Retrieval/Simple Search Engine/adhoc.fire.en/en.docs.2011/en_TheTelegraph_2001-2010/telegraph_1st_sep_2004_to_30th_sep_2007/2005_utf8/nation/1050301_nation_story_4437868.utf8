 Bounty bypasses Valley police

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has provided a Special Plan Assistance to Jammu and Kashmir under a recently approved reconstruction plan but has not been able to accommodate the home ministry?s request for a substantial raise in allocation of funds for the modernisation of police forces.

 Chidambaram told Parliament that the government had fixed the plan size of the state at Rs 4,200 crore, up from Rs 3,008 crore in the current fiscal, and promised to provide adequate funds for the Baglihar project that was allocated Rs 300 crore this year.

 But internal security ? that Union home minister Shivraj Patil believes needs a huge infusion of funds ? did not appear to be on the finance minister?s radar. 

 The home minister had drawn comparisons with the defence modernisation funds at a recent parliamentary consultative committee meeting to mobilise opinion for a generous dose of funds.

 There may not be a full-fledged war but the police forces will certainly have to handle the low-intensity war waged by terrorists and extremists, Patil had argued. He does not seem to have got his way with Chidambaram, who raised funds for police modernisation by a meagre Rs 40 crore to Rs 900 crore.

 The finance minister, however, increased the allocation for a planned expansion of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) that guards the borders with Nepal and Bhutan. 

 The non-plan funds for the SSB have also been proposed to increase from Rs 360.24 crore to Rs 532.77 crore and will help the force set up more checkposts along the border, begin raising 20 additional battalions and procure modern equipment.

 There has also been a significant increase in the allocation for the Civil Defence Force in the next fiscal, with the government proposing to increase the budgetary provisions from Rs 16.11 crore to Rs 213.38 crore. A major chunk of this amount is expected to be spent for conducting disaster mitigation and awareness programmes.

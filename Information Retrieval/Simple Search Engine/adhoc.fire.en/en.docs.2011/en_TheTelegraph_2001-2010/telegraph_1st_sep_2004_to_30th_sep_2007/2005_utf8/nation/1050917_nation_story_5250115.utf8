 Waste of time, cry Pak leaders

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 16: Pakistani leaders have termed the New York meeting between President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as a complete failure with most blaming Delhis obduracy for the lack of headway.

 Some leaders wondered whether its any use for Pakistan to continue the peace talks.

 The four-hour meeting, which included a 30-minute one-to-one, was followed by a joint statement that pledged not to allow terrorism to hobble the peace process.

 The statement does not speak of any progress; it just repeats stated positions, said Opposition MP Liaqat Baloch. He felt its mere wishful thinking on the part of Pakistani diplomats that they can persuade a stubborn India to settle outstanding issues, especially Kashmir.

 Musharraf claimed the meeting was successful but former ISI chief Gen. Hameed Gul was sceptical even of the larger peace process.

 The dialogue, he said, will drag on because of US pressure, but it will not make any headway. Both he and Baloch partly blamed the mechanics of Indian politics.

 We should not expect any breakthrough because Singh is one of the weakest Prime Ministers in Indian political history, being a member of the party headed by Sonia Gandhi, who does not in a real sense enjoy acceptability among the people of India, Baloch argued.

 Gul echoed this, suggesting Musharraf was perhaps shying away from the reality of Indian politics.

 Sherry Rehman, a woman MP from Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party, was equally disappointed at the lack of forward movement.

 The information secretary of Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League, too, thought that Pakistan was wasting its time discussing Kashmir with India.

 Singh did not mention Kashmir anywhere even after meeting Musharraf, which shows Indias stubbornness on the issue, Siddique-ul-Farooque said.

 He argued that Delhi has been able to convince the West that the freedom struggle in Kashmir is a terrorist movement. I dont think anybody would like to listen to Pakistan in the West because of the strong clout enjoyed by India there.

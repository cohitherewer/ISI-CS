 NDA in code cry on Buta 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The BJP-led NDA today urged the Election Commission to cancel appointments made by Bihar governor Buta Singh after the schedule for the Assembly polls in October and November was announced on Saturday.

 An NDA delegation submitted a memorandum to the poll panel pointing out that the model code of conduct had come into effect immediately with the announcement of the elections. The governors appointments that day to the Bihar Public Service Commission, Bihar Backward Class Commission, Bihar State Minority Commission, the 15-point programme implementation committee and the Bihar State Nagrik Parishad should therefore be cancelled, it said.

 The memorandum cited a provision in the model code that forbids public appointments after polls are announced even in states that are under Presidents rule, as is the case in Bihar. It said the vacancies in these bodies were there for a long time and there was no hurry to fill them on the day the election code came into force.

 The memorandum pointed out that politicians wielding influence had been appointed to the bodies. Laxmi Devi and Sudama Rai, appointed to the public service commission, are from the RJD and Congress. Ram Karan Pal, appointed to the backward class commission, is a state vice-president of the RJD and Gulam Tahir, who has made it to the minority commission, has been personal secretary to former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi.

 The decision of the governor is colourable and amounts to a direct challenge not only to the model code of conduct but the impartial authority of the EC, the memorandum said. The leaders in the delegation included Arun Jaitley, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Sharad Yadav, Nitish Kumar, Shambhu Nath Singh, K.C. Tyagi, Prakash Javadekar and R. Ramakrishna.

 A UPA team is likely to meet the election commissioners tomorrow and ask for the election schedule to be revised.

 Arm chopped in bus race

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: A man lost his arm this evening when the bus he was in made a mad dash to overtake another.

 Sukhari Paswan, 58, was in a bus plying on route 234, his arms hanging out of the window, when the vehicle tried to race past a route 34C bus, which was waiting to pick up passengers near Khanna cinema around 6.15 pm.

 The mans severed arm fell into the 34C bus as the 234 raced ahead. Then it dumped him near Belgharia police station and sped away. 

 Belgharia police saw the man bleeding profusely and rushed him to RG Kar Hospital around 6.45 pm. Passengers of the other bus discovered the severed portion of the arm and officers from Shyamapukur police station took it to RG Kar Hospital, an official of Calcutta traffic police said.

 Hospital officials said Paswans arm has been operated upon but the severed portion could not be re-attached.

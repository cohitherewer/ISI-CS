 Cold water on couples sex test hopes

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR 

 Mumbai, June 13: For once, somebody doesnt want a boy. But Vinod Soni has no way of finding out if his third child will be a girl till his wife delivers.

 A division bench of Bombay High Court today dismissed a petition filed by the 28-year-old Mumbai goldsmith that sought permission to allow his pregnant wife Sunita to undergo a sex-determination test.

 After two sons ? Dharmesh, 7, and Dharma, 2 ? the couple wants a daughter and had challenged the ban on sex-determination tests, saying the state had no right to interfere in such personal matters of an individual. 

 But Justices V.G. Palshikar and V.C. Daga threw out the couples plea, saying the current laws did not have the provision to allow such tests and granting permission would be a violation of the Constitution.

 The petition had run into controversy after a newspaper reported that Vinod, who runs a shop in Kalbadevi, and Sunita had not filed the plea on their own but at the alleged prodding of infertility expert Aniruddha Malpani. 

 The doctor, who runs a successful infertility clinic in Colaba, had challenged the ban on gender tests in the Supreme Court in 2001.

 Following the reports, two non-government organisations ? the Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes and the other represented by activist Teesta Setalvad ? had intervened, seeking the dismissal of the petition.

 The NGOs said if the court granted the couples request, it would, in the long run, have an impact on the already skewed sex ratio in the country, which has slumped from 972 girls for every 1,000 boys in 1901 to 927 in 1991. According to statistics, Mumbai has an even worse gender ratio ? 898 girls for 1,000 boys.

 The couples lawyer, Anil Anthurkar, said: I would have to consult my clients and decide if they wish to challenge the order. The detailed judgment would be available two days later.

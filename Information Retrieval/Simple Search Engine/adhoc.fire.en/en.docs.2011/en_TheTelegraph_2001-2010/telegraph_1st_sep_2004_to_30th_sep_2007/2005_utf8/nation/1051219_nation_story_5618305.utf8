 Demolition fury gets Sheila scrambling

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dikshit: Party woes

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: Numbed by the violent reaction to large-scale demolitions in Delhis residential areas, chief minister Sheila Dikshit today sought the Centres help.

 Her colleagues in the state Congress, though, seemed to rejoice in the chief ministers plight. They chose to make their own plans about how to cope with the immense public anger generated by the demolitions. 

 As the rage was mostly directed at the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the state government and Dikshit, local Congressmen made sure they distanced the partys activities as far as possible from the chief minister, who is bearing the brunt of the protests.

 While residents of some west Delhi localities, particularly Pitampura, resorted to pelting stones at policemen, peaceful protests were staged across the city. 

 Anger was mounting against the Congress, which ironically won all but one Lok Sabha seat here in the last polls as there was widespread anger against former urban development minister Jagmohans demolition drives in the city.

 The Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, headed by Dikshit-baiter Ram Babu Sharma, held an emergency meeting this afternoon.

 Local MPs Jagdish Tytler, Sajjan Kumar and Krishna Tirath, all known to be virulently against Dikshit, attended the meeting. Dikshits son Sandeep, the MP from East Delhi, Ajay Maken, the MP from New Delhi, and science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, who represents Chandni Chowk, skipped the meeting. 

 Ajay Maken and Kapil Sibal had informed us in advance. There was no word from Sandeep, said Sharma.

 We are all very concerned about this series of demolitions. Of course, we will not interfere in the courts orders but we have to seek redress for the common people who are suffering. We will meet the lieutenant-governor and the urban development minister.

 Asked why he was seeking separate meetings when Dikshit had met them, Sharma said: The organisation has to have a different approach. We have to think of different ways to solve the problem.

 Dikshit said she met Union urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy today to discuss the problem of unauthorised constructions in Delhi. I have already requested the Centre to make amendments in the master plan of Delhi so that people do not suffer for the wrong deeds of others.

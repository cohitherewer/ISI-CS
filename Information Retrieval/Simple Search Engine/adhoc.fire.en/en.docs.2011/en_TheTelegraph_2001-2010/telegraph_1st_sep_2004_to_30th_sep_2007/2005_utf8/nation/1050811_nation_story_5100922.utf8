The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Night amp; morn, Left pesters amp; forces govt hand

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: The morning finally decided the day.

 Left leaders had last night told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh they could not defend his governments action taken report in Parliament unless his party changed its stand on the Nanavati Commissions recommendations.

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan spoke to Singh late in the night after a daylong dilemma over what stand to take on the Opposition-sponsored adjournment motion against the government. 

 Sources said Bardhan told Singh it was impossible for the Left to defend the action taken report as it is on the floor of the House and hoped ? also for the Prime Ministers sake ? that the Centre would change it.

 The Congress-led regime could have been in a spot had the BJP and the Left voted against the government. It was this consideration that earlier in the day had prompted Left MPs to assure the Congress at a parliamentary co-ordination committee meeting that they would not vote with the BJP.

 But their dilemma intensified as the day wore on. The Left did not want to support the Opposition-sponsored motion but at the same time did not want to send out the message that they were with the government on the action taken report. Conflicting signals went out from the parties.

 We have decided not to vote with the BJP on this issue. We cannot vote with them, said CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta, who attended the co-ordination committee meeting.

 Dasgupta conceded that the Left was in a bind but the bottom line was they could not support an adjournment motion backed by a party that condoned the 2002 Gujarat violence and jeopardise the survival of the United Progressive Alliance dispensation.

 The stand changed a couple of hours later. In the evening, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and his CPI counterpart Bardhan met at A.K. Gopalan Bhavan.

 Karat told Bardhan the Left could not vote in favour of the government if it stuck to its action taken report, which virtually exonerated those named by the probe panel. 

 Even abstention from voting would be tricky as it would suggest that the Left is reluctant to take a firm stand.

 News of the Lefts dilemma reached the Congress. Senior leaders Pranab Mukherjee and Ghulam Nabi Azad scheduled a meeting with Left MPs at 9.30 this morning before the Lok Sabha session started.

 With the Left mounting pressure on the government on the adjournment motion, it had little option other than holding out concrete assurances to deliver justice.

 The government, at this mornings meeting of the co-ordination committee, told the Left it has decided to re-open and probe cases against those the Nanavati Commission has pointed a finger at, take action against the guilty police officials and work out a rehabilitation package.

 At the end of the daylong debate, the Left voted against the Opposition-sponsored motion.

 Sonia keeps Natwar out

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: Sonia Gandhi has dropped former foreign minister Natwar Singh from the guest lists of all Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi trust functions.

 Singh is a key member of both the Nehru and the Indira Gandhi memorial trusts. Indications suggest his name has also been removed from the list of invitees to Singaporean leader Lee Kwan Yews lecture scheduled in the capital next week.

 Speaking at a recent function, Sonia had made it clear that neither she nor the government would interfere with the investigations into the findings of the Volcker Committee report. 

 The Congress president had added that all attempts would be made to pin down those who had used the partys name to get funds for personal use from Saddam Hussein.

 As part of the decision, Singh, who is vice-chairman of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, was absent at todays function where Thai Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhon was honoured by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam with the Indira Gandhi peace prize. Sirindhon was chosen for the award because of her development work in villages.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia were among the guests at the function.

 Soon after he was removed as foreign minister, Singh had embarrassed the government by landing up at Kalams banquet for the visiting Czech President at Rashtrapati Bhavan a fortnight ago. Guests at the banquet said that though Singh was seated at the same table with the Congress president, she hardly spoke to him at the dinner, which lasted nearly two hours.

 Sonias move to distance herself from Singh, who was seen as a confidant, is significant at a time when Parliament is scheduled to start its winter session. 

 The Volcker report will be one of the main issues to be raised by the Opposition during the House session.

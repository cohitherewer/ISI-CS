 ?Upper hand? troubles Singh 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Manmohan, Sonia 

 New Delhi, March 15: Manmohan Singh is apparently keen to allay an impression in the political establishment that the Prime Minister?s Office and the government have the ?upper hand? over the Congress, party sources said.

 The buzzword in the ruling establishment is that the Prime Minister has a ?consensual? approach to policy and decision-making and consults his party as also the UPA allies.

 The impression, or rather ?mis-impression?, was created when sections of the government tried to project former Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren?s resignation and the invitation to the NDA?s Arjun Munda as Singh?s ?unilateral? decision.

 The Prime Minister was ostensibly agitated by the goings-on in the Jharkhand Assembly and the strong criticism these drew from opinion-moulders.

 The Supreme Court?s orders of March 9 advancing the Ranchi floor test and specifying the manner in which it should be conducted are said to have exacerbated Singh?s sense of disquiet. Also, Singh, party sources said, wanted to counter leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani?s incessant charge that he was an ?invisible? Prime Minister.

 Conscious of the Jharkhand issue?s potency in driving a government-party wedge, Advani praised Singh the very next day for showing ?glimpses of visibility? by getting Soren to quit even as the BJP continued to blast Congress chief Sonia Gandhi over her ?greed for power?.

 The sources said a section in the Congress, including a senior cabinet minister allegedly unreconciled to Singh as Prime Minister, privately voiced ?reservations? about him trying to be ?one-up? on Sonia by ?distancing? himself from the party and showing himself as ?squeaky clean?.

 At this stage, Singh?s strategists stepped in to banish any such ?misgiving?. ?It was a joint decision of the PM and Sonia Gandhi that Soren should be asked to step down after the House (Jharkhand legislature) was twice adjourned,? said a source close to Singh.

 ?The PM first spoke to her and then consulted his allies ? the Left, Laloo Prasad Yadav and M. Karunanidhi. When he got their go-ahead, he called the home minister, who conveyed the decision to the Jharkhand governor,? the sources said.

 Singh was of the view that the apex court had pushed the frontiers of its jurisdiction vis-a-vis the legislature because the latter had ?provided an opening? and that public sympathy was with the NDA, rightly or wrongly, they added.

 This was why he was not keen that Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee should hold a meeting of presiding officers of Assemblies and councils when Parliament was in session.

 Bangla amp; Bengal link in grain scam

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Feb. 6: The multicrore foodgrain scam in Uttar Pradesh has revealed a link to Bangladesh via Bengal.

 A dossier on the scam that various state government departments submitted to Allahabad High Court showed that some fly-by-night operators based in Uttar Pradesh were selling the grain, meant for the Sampurna Gramin Rozgar Yojna (SGRY), in Bangladesh.

 The grain, fraudulently procured from the welfare programme?s stock supplied by the Centre, was sold through Benapole, Petrapole and Gede at the Bengal border with Bangladesh.

 Several firms in Calcutta and Siliguri in north Bengal are under the scanner for their alleged role in brokering a deal with Bangladeshi traders.

 The pilferage ? estimated at Rs 1,000-odd crore, though the state puts it at Rs 50 crore ? was first detected in October last year.

 The SGRY was launched by the Centre in 2001 to end the cycle of poverty in rural areas. Uttar Pradesh, with a large below-poverty-line population, was the biggest beneficiary.

 Railway records, made available to the high court, showed that a large number of railway rakes had been booked to carry foodgrain from Gonda, Basti, Nakhajangal and Muradabad districts of Uttar Pradesh.

 The scamsters produced fake papers and vehicle registration numbers to show the grain had been delivered to the poor. But it had instead found its way from 30 districts to the black market and then to Bangladesh.

 The number of rakes booked for the grain made investigators suspicious that it could have been lifted from the open market.

 ?It is impossible to imagine that the frequency with which the booking for selling foodgrain was made could have been possible by honest traders. We have asked for details of such bookings in 2003 and 2002,? a state officer said.

 Petitioners who went to the high court against the scam are now using the latest revelation to demand a CBI probe.

 Viswanath Chaturvedi, a lawyer, filed a writ petition, arguing it would be impossible for any agency other than the CBI to explore the dimensions of the scam.

 The court will take up the issue in the second week this month.

 Uttar Pradesh, which ducked the probe demand in an affidavit filed in court, maintained ?it is incorrect that the state is not taking action?.

 ?The state government has suspended 17 officers and six officials. Sixty-five FIRs have been drawn up,? said Kapil Dev Tripathi, special secretary, food and civil supplies department.

 In November last year, P.C. Chaturvedi, principal secretary in the department, had written to two railway officers seeking details on the ?indents of foodgrain for a very large number of railway rakes, placed by various parties for movement of wheat/rice to Bangladesh?.

 Chaturvedi had felt that ?presently, the stock of wheat and rice in open market of UP is not such as to fulfil the required capacity of railway rakes?.

 K.K. Srivastava, divisional railway manager, North-Eastern Railway, replied on December 10, giving exhaustive details of the indents and mentioning the names of companies involved in both Bangladesh and India.

 Srivastava also informed that 106 railway rakes had been booked to transport wheat and rice to Bangladesh between August and November 2004.

 Amitabh Lal, Srivastava?s counterpart in Northern Railway, wrote on December 23 that 47 rakes for Bangladesh were booked from Barabanki district alone between September 26 and October 25, 2004.

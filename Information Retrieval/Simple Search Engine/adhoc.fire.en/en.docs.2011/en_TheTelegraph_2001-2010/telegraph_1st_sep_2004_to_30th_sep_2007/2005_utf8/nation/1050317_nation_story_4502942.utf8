 Sonia spared Naidu ?roadshow?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, March 16: With Rajiv Gandhi on her lips, Sonia Gandhi flew through a political storm and got off the ground the construction of an airport named after him.

 ?It was here in Hyderabad that Rajiv Gandhi had undergone training as a pilot before joining politics,? she said after laying the foundation stone for the international airport at Shamshabad, about 25 km from here.

 Former chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose Telugu Desam Party has kicked up a storm over the airport?s name, and supporters tried to march to the place where Sonia landed but all were taken into preventive custody and released later.

 Demanding that the airport be named after N.T. Rama Rao, Naidu said the move to ignore NTR was a blot on Telugu ?pride?. 

 Ironically, NTR had spent his last years in political oblivion and distress following a coup by Naidu, the late leader?s son-in-law. 

 Sonia did not refer to the controversy during her speech but she surprised local Congress supporters by praising P.V. Narasimha Rao, the former Prime Minister who passed away recently. Congress leaders in Andhra Pradesh never lose any opportunity to create the impression that the Nehru-Gandhi family and Rao could not get along.

 ?He (Rao) served the state and the country in various capacities and one cannot forget his contribution to the party at large,? she said at the outset of her speech.

 In an oblique reference to the development in Jharkhand and Goa, the Congress president said political parties are playing power games. ?Politics is not a game for power for me,? said Sonia, who has come under Opposition attack over the Jharkhand fiasco.

 ?Some parties had made politics a khel to meet their political agenda,? she added.

 Sonia also addressed the bitter tussle between a section of Congress leaders and supporters of a Telengana state. The Congress president said Telengana is on top of her mind and she would make every effort to achieve that soon. 

 Her assurance is being seen as a balm on the wounds of the pro-Telengana lobby in the Congress and its ally TRS. The partners were at loggerheads on the issue.

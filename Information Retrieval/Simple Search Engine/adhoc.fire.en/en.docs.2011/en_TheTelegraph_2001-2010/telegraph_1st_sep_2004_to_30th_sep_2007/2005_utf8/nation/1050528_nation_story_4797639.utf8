 Vajpayee backs Modi 

 New Delhi, May 27: A year ago, around the same time and at the same place, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made a scathing attack on Narendra Modi. Today, in Manali for his annual break from Delhis sweltering heat, the former Prime Minister sang a different tune, reports our special correspondent.

 On vacation after two months of hectic campaigning last year, Vajpayee had squarely blamed the Gujarat chief minister for the NDAs shock defeat in the Lok Sabha elections and suggested he step down.

 But today he lent his support to Modi and warned the UPA government against dislodging his government through undemocratic means. 

 His reference was to the Gujarat Congress clamour for Modis scalp after a former state police official publicly accused him of aiding and abetting the communal violence during the post-Godhra riots.

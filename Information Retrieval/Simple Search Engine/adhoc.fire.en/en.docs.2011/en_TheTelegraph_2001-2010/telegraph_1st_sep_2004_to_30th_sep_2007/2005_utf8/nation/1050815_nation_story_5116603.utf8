 Mahajan sleepless

 Guwahati, Aug. 14 (PTI): Pramod Mahajan is losing sleep, and its not because of the opposition.

 The BJP leader today complained that the sound of drums kept him awake at the three-star hotel where he was staying during a three-day visit to the state.

 As I reached my room in the first floor after dinner at a friends place and took to bed around 10.30 pm, I heard the sound of drums from beneath, Mahajan said. The noise was traced to a disco bar just below his room.

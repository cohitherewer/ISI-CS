 Literary flight fails don

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Babloo: No luck

 Lucknow, Oct. 14: A music band waited to greet the don-turned-author at his 43rd birthday celebrations, which coincided with the release of his book, Adhure Khwab (Unfulfilled Dream). 

 A Delhi court had granted him two hours parole, from noon till 2 clock, to let him make the journey from Bareilly jail to Lucknows Co-operative Bhavan and back.

 It was the government helicopter that failed Babloo Srivastava. And his khwab of releasing his own book remained adhura.

 His publisher and party comrades were forced to stage a Hamlet without the prince of Denmark: they had the book released in the absence of the author. The Co-operative Bhavan hall was packed with workers of Apna Dal, the party on whose ticket Babloo ? one-time Dawood Ibrahim henchman and now his sworn enemy ? had fought an election.

 The state police later officially regretted their failure to get the jailed don to the venue, saying the panchayat poll schedule in Bareilly had kept the force too busy.

 Babloos book has the author on its cover, looking the archetypal gangster in dark glasses, prominently carrying a gun as well as a pile of currency notes, a burning cigarette dangling from his lips. Running to 331 glossy pages and priced at Rs 85, the book is expected to be made into a film with Babloo himself in the lead role.

 In the book, Babloo, who has been in jail for the past 12 years, has described the D-Companys methods of operation. He has described how hawala money is channelled to various countries and fake passports sold.

 We have passports of Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Philippines, an agent tells gangsters in the book. I will get a Citibank credit card made for Pakistan. Give me the money: Rs 60,000 for a passport.

 The book traces the rift between Dawood and Chhota Rajan, Babloos life in Nepal and his attempt to dismantle Dawoods D-company.

 The book is named Adhure Khwab because Babloo failed to destroy the D-company, said publisher Satish Verma.

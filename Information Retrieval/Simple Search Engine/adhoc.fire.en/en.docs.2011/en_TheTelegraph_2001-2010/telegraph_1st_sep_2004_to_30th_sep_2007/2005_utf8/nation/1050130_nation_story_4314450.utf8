The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Advani plays film host

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 29: As home minister and later deputy Prime Minister, he gifted a new phrase to the nation?s political lexicon.

 It was called ?film diplomacy? and used mostly on Saturday evenings at the capital?s Mahadev Road auditorium where almost every Bollywood release would be screened to keep political friends and journalists happy. 

 Now, as leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, L.K. Advani has resorted to ?film diplomacy? to win over ?foes?. The venue was a mini auditorium in his residence. A film ?anchored? by his daughter Pratibha was the medium of the ?diplomacy?. 

 Instead of fanning out in the badlands of Bihar, the BJP president this week played host at the screening of Ananya Bharti. The film was a Chitrahaar clone of patriotic songs from Bollywood films since the 1940s. Pratibha was appropriately dressed in a ghagra-choli in the colours of the Indian flag.

 It began with a song from Kismet, one of Ashok Kumar?s earliest films, and ended with one from Ashutosh Gowariker?s Swades. In between, songs from Chetan Anand?s Haqeeqat, Manoj Kumar?s Shaheed and Purab Paschim, Gulzar?s Maachis, Gowariker?s Lagaan and Mani Ratnam?s Roja were thrown in.

 The spectators included senior Congress ministers Shivraj Patil and Sunil Dutt and the Nationalist Congress Party?s Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel. Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee put in an appearance as did the Samajwadi Party?s Amar Singh. India Inc. was represented by Sunil Mittal and the culture world by danseuse Sonal Mansingh.

 The guest list was interesting not so much for who the guests were but how they vibed with each other. Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Ram Jethmalani were perfectly comfortable in each other?s company despite the acrimonious circumstances in which Jethmalani had quit the NDA government as law minister. Vajpayee reportedly feasted on raaj kachori, stuffed with yoghurt. 

 Narendra Modi and Smriti Z. Irani, who had demanded the Gujarat chief minister?s resignation, publicly buried the hatchet. In what seemed like lines plucked out of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, the soap queen told Modi that when ?kids? make mistakes, it was for their ?elders? to forgive them. Modi placed his hand over her head and proclaimed let bygones be bygones.

 There was no paucity of explanations for the show?s timing. Some claimed the ?rumblings? in the ruling alliance over seat-sharing in Bihar and Jharkhand did not augur well for its stability and it was time to blueprint an alternative in which Advani would have a major role. Others said it was meant to keep the BJP chief ?in circulation?.

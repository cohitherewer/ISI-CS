 Age cant test Dalai patience

July 6: Prayers, dancing and the sound of bagpipes marked a key moment in the Dalai Lamas long, public life today. He became an old man, officially.

 But as his followers and admirers celebrated his 70th birthday at Dharamsala, the monk showed no signs that, looking at his unfinished tasks, he might be feeling pressed for time.

 Does he still hope the dispute with China will be resolved in his lifetime, someone asked from among the crowd of Tibetan refugees, reporters and foreign tourists.

 I hope so! We need patience and determination, the Nobel Peace Prize winner replied.

 A 70th birthday, a landmark in any culture, is especially significant for Tibetans as it is believed to mark the start of old age. But Tibetan Buddhisms supreme spiritual leader measures time in days, not years.

 For me, each day is a birthday. Each day, you realise something is important, he said as thousands braved a heavy downpour, standing silently under colourful umbrellas to hear him speak.

 Each day, I begin with a pledge that the rest of the day should be utilised in a positive way. I am grateful to all the people praying for my long life. As long as I live, I will live for others.

 So, for Tibetans in exile who want to return home, he had a one-word message: Patience.

 Others, obviously have less of the quality than him.

 Two of his representatives met Chinese government officials in Switzerland last week and both sides were said to be nervous about what would happen if the celebrity monk were to die in exile.

 Yet there is little sign of compromise in Beijing and no relaxation of the countrywide ban on observing his birthday. Chinas official spokesman said that if the Dalai Lama wants to return to Tibet, he has to clearly and publicly recognise that Tibet is an inseparable part of China.

 The Dalai Lama has dropped demands for Tibetan independence and is asking for cultural and religious autonomy under Chinese sovereignty.

 In Dharamsala, the seat of his government-in-exile, some 10,000 people prayed outside his home, many of them having risked the perilous journey over the Himalayas from Tibet.

 Bagpipers in multicoloured brocade robes and brown fur hats played sprightly tunes and women in traditional Tibetan silk robes danced to the sound of cymbals as the smiling monk entered a vast pavilion with his hands folded.

 Even activists of the Tibetan Youth Congress, a hardliner organisation that campaigns for full independence and often opposes the Dalai Lamas middle path approach, joined the prayers. 

 He was remembered even in Scotland where the worlds eight richest nations begin a meeting tomorrow. 

 At a news conference in Edinburgh, rock singer Annie Lennox read out a statement from the Dalai Lama, who called on G8 leaders to do their utmost to ease the plight of millions suffering from poverty.

 Chandigarh, Sept. 5: The embers of the Gohana hut burnings smoked again today as angry Dalits clashed with police in Amritsar, Kapurthala and Ludhiana.

 Protesting against the end-August torching of 50 huts by the Jats, the Dalits took to the streets, trying to ransack private property and forcing shopowners to down shutters. But the police dealt with matters with a firm hand.

 Trouble erupted when the protesters reached the bus stand on G.T. Road and started pelting stones on the police and damaging shops and cars parked nearby.

 They dispersed after the police wielded lathis but gathered again near the Town Hall inside the walled city and manhandled some schoolchildren. There was a second round of lathicharge, with policemen even pelting stones at the protesters.

 More damage would have been done had the police not acted swiftly. The protesters were bent on destroying public and private property.

 Some had to be pulled out of homes they had barged into to escape the police. Window panes of houses were damaged by the miscreants, a police officer said.

 The protesters broke the window-panes of three Punjab Roadways buses in Amritsar and damaged some cars, trucks and scooters. The police stepped in when they tried to set the vehicles on fire.

 Twenty people were arrested for rioting in Amritsar. They were freed in the evening. Six police personnel were injured. Fear of impending violence hung in the air till late in the evening. 

 Security has been beefed up and extra forces deployed to maintain law and order and thwart any further attempt to disturb the peace.

 In Kapurthala, protesters tried to set on fire a religious place, causing damage to the structure. Police presence in the town has been beefed up but the situation remained tense.

 Punjab was rocked by caste violence in 2003 when Dalits clashed with Jats in Talhan near Jalandhar for control of a gurdwara.

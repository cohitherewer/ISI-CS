 Sena shock

 Mumbai, Nov. 22: Beaten in Bihar, the Congress found a balm in Maharashtra.

 Congress candidates Narayan Rane, the most trusted lieutenant of Bal Thackeray till six months ago, and Priya Dutt, daughter of the late Sunil Dutt, drubbed BJP ally Shiv Sena in the byelections.

 In Mumbais North West parliamentary constituency, Priya defeated her Shiv Sena rival Madhukar Sarpotdar by a margin of 172,043 votes.

 Doubts had set in about Priyas electoral prospects because of her brother actor Sanjays suspected involvement in the Bombay blasts. The issue returned to haunt the actor after gangster Abu Salem was extradited.

 Bal Thackeray, who is said to have played a key role in getting Sanjay released from prison, did not rake up the case during the election campaign.

 Many in the Sena feel that their leader, who had a good rapport with Sunil Dutt, did not launch a full-throated attack on Priya. The seat she won was held by her father for five terms.

 In the Malwan Assembly seat, Sena candidate Parshuram Uparkar fought ex-comrade Rane. A bitter political squabble with Thackerays son, Uddhav, led to Ranes ouster from the Sena, which had built him as the voice of Konkan. 

 The Malwan result has dealt a body blow to the Sena as both Thackeray and Uddhav had campaigned extensively there. For Uddhav, whose leadership is under a scanner within the Sena, Malwan was a battle of prestige.

 Rane, who called for Uddhavs resignation as Sena chief, is believed to be close to Raj, Uddhavs cousin and bete noire. Raj stayed away from campaigning at Malwan complaining of a bad back.

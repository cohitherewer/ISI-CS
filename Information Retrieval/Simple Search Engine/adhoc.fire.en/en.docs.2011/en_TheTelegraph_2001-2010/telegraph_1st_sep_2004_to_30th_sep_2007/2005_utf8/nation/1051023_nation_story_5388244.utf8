 Red vs Red in Moscow 

 - CPI faces stiff challenge from CPM in Bihar bastion 

 TILAK D. GUPTA

 If Begusarai district had been termed Bihars Soviet land, Bihat village is known as Moscow in local parlance. 

 It has given birth to five MLAs, including two ministers, and all of them save one belong to the CPI. However, this election, the CPI is having a real tough time holding on to its declining political base in the region.

 Bihat falls within the Barauni Assembly constituency that has been held by the CPI uninterruptedly since 1962, says 72-year-old Janardan Singh, a villager and an educationist. 

 And the biggest irony of the situation here is that three-time CPI winner Rajender Singh now faces the stiffest challenge of his political life from none other than Dinesh Singh of the CPM. 

 The clash between the comrades has attracted much media attention in Bihar.

 The voters may get confused because the flags and the poll symbols of the two contenders are so similar, says an apprehensive CPI supporter in the village. 

 Although the reds are contesting each other for three seats ? Barauni, Begusarai and Rajgir ? the hammer and sickle is expected to give a fight only in Barauni. 

 Unlike Bengal, where the CPM leads the Left show, the CPI is the big brother in Bihar. Polls here are scheduled on October 26.

 The now-closed Barauni Fertiliser factory, the dying Barauni Thermal Plant and the Barauni Oil Refinery are near Bihat. The Barauni railway yard also cuts through the village and its inhabitants are politically well informed and articulate. TV has entered many homes and many others routinely listen to BBC radios Hindi service. 

 Prabhat Kumar, a plus-two student and a first-time voter, insists that the Congresss and the Rashtriya Janata Dals support to the CPM nominee has made the going tough for the CPI. He, however, hastens to add that Rajender Babu will eventually scrape through by a narrow margin.

 As night falls, the low-voltage electricity comes off and on, but consumers are not complaining too much. Most villagers, both rich and poor, illegally hook power from the transmission line and free electricity is a perk they habitually enjoy here. 

 Maize is the staple diet in this district, though Bihar is predominantly a rice-eating state. The crops have been poor this time due to inadequate rainfall but no political party is talking about it at poll meetings, alleges Ramnaresh Singh, a poor peasant-cum-dairy farmer.

 Bihat is a large Bhumihar-dominated village. The dominant community is clearly split into pro-CPI and anti-CPI lobbies. The CPI has cheated the masses, alleges Prabhat. Asked to illustrate the point, he says though all the lower caste poor rallied behind the party, the leaders and the MLAs here have always been Bhumihars. 

 Prabhat, himself a Bhumihar, seems to belong to the anti-CPI camp. His father, however, concedes that the CPI once played a glorious role in organising the rural poor against feudal tyranny, but now it has turned more into a party of self-seekers.

 The other irony of the situation is that the old feudal elements as well as the neo-rich in Bihat, including anti-socials, may vote for the CPM this time, if only to defeat the CPI. 

 We would have voted for Nitish Kumar but his partys candidate here is rather weak, says Rambilas Singh, a civil contractor in Bihat. So we will back Dinesh, the CPM candidate, to end CPI monopoly over the seat. 

 Another wealthy landowner-cum-transporter of the village says that his vote will go the CPM way. The anti-CPI Bhumihar lobby would largely support Dinesh Singh, he suggests. 

 Although a significant number of landless labourers are now disillusioned with the CPI, the majority among them continue to back the party, concede even anti-CPI elements.

 Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit are seeking votes for Dinesh Singh at a mass meeting being held on the Bihat Thakurbari ground. RJD MP Ramkripal Yadav also urges people to support the CPM candidate.

 Aiyar talks about modernising the Barauni Oil Refinery and reviving sick industries. The RJD speaker asks people to rise up to attain social justice.

 At Bihat, everyone says the CPM does not have many votes of its own. The CPM voters here are moneyed people living in brick houses, but the CPI votes will come from huts as well, says Prabhat. 

 The CPM has not joined the Secular Democratic Front (SDF), formed by the RJD, the Congress and Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress, and has only a seat adjustment with it. 

 The CPM central committee has also decided against a joint campaign with the SDF and the party issued its separate manifesto. With Dikshit garlanding the CPM nominee at the Bihat meeting amid slogans of Inquilab Jindabad, it is evident that desperation for electoral gains has prevailed over lofty principles.

 On a different plane, the clash between the comrades is also a battle between the two most aggressive upper castes of Bihar. Dinesh, a Rajput, has dared to challenge the entrenched Bhumihar hegemony. And it reminds us that before the emergence of OBCs or Dalits as independent entities in the political arena, it was the Rajput-Bhumihar rivalry that largely dictated the course of Bihar politics.

 DMK chief keeps son waiting for lollipop

 Stalin: Papa going strong 

 Vellore, Aug. 28: The DMK has named M. Karunanidhi as its chief minister candidate for the April 2006 Assembly polls, ending months of ambiguity that had kept its allies worried.

 The other name doing the rounds had been that of Karunanidhis son M.K. Stalin, especially because of the four-time chief ministers age. But todays announcement makes it clear that the octogenarian is ready for a fifth term if the Democratic Progressive Alliance ? which includes the Congress ? can upset chief minister Jayalalithaas apple cart.

 The announcement solves a problem for the DMKs allies, particularly the MDMK, whose leader Vaiko is more comfortable with Karunanidhi being projected the chief minister candidate. Had Stalin been chosen for the top job, the allies would have been hard put to answer the ruling ADMKs charge of dynastic rule.

 At the DMKs two-day party conference under way here, speaker after speaker rose to support the choice of Kalaignar (Karunanidhi). The reason offered was an emotional one: the party had scores to settle with Jayalalithaa.

 Shortly after coming to power in 2001, the chief minister had Karunanidhi arrested at midnight from his home, sparking a controversy.

 It was former state agriculture minister, Veerapandi S. Arumugam, who suggested that the party make Kalaignar the chief minister again. Stalin immediately seconded the line, saying: I fully endorse Veerapandi Arumugams plea that Karunanidhi should come back as chief minister ? not because he is hankering after power, but because Jayalalithaa has ruined Tamil Nadu during the four-and-a-half years of her rule by her arbitrariness and authoritarian ways.

 This means Stalin, a DMK deputy general secretary, must wait for some more time before he can step into his fathers shoes.

 Party insiders said with Jayalalithaa rolling out a slew of social welfare programmes and other sops, it would have been tough for Stalin to take her on. It needed someone of the stature of Karunanidhi to match the chief ministers popularity.

 Arumugam has exhorted party functionaries and cadre to be ready for any sacrifice as we have a score to settle with Jayalalithaa for her brutal midnight arrest of Kalaignar in June 2001.

 Referring to the Supreme Court verdict freeing self-financing colleges from government quotas, the former Coimbatore MP, M. Ramanathan, said that social justice could be restored only under Kalaignars leadership.

 Stalin told the conference that top state officials, including the chief secretary and director-general of police, were furthering the ruling partys interests. We must be ready to even sacrifice our lives to protect the ideals of the Dravidian movement and place the (poll) victory at your feet, the son said turning towards his father, seated on the dais.

 Bilkis set for month-end court date

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 13: A special court today framed charges against 19 of the 20 accused in the Bilkis Bano case, the second high-profile riot-related trial to be transferred outside Gujarat after the Best Bakery case. 

 Judge U.D. Salvi of the special court here also directed Bilkis to be present on January 27 when the recording of evidence will start. One of the two eyewitnesses in the case among a total of 115 witnesses, Bilkis will appear before a court for the first time. 

 According to the prosecution, 17 members of the minority community, including a pregnant Bilkis and her three-year-old daughter, Saleha, were attacked by a mob at Devgarh Baria village of Dahod district on March 3, 2002, as they were running from one place to another after the riots began. Only Bilkis and two others survived. Eight were killed and six are reported missing. 

 The prosecution alleged that accused Shailesh Bhatt had snatched little Saleha and killed her by hurling her to the ground while Jaswant Nai, Govind Nai and Naresh Kumar raped Bilkis, who was six months pregnant at the time. Eight others ? Radhesham Shah, Bipin Joshi, Kesarbhai Vahania, Pradeep Mordiya, Bakabhai Vahania, Raju Soni, Mitesh Bhatt and Ramesh Chandana ? were involved in the massacre. 

 The CBI has also accused six police officers and a doctor couple of abetment. All the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges explained to them in court today. 

 The policemen allegedly refused to take down Bilkis? complaint. Instead, they forced her to sign some papers and threatened her not to go public with her accusations. 

 The two doctors ? Arun Kumar and Sangeeta Prasad, who conducted the post-mortem ? were charged under sections 120(b) (conspiracy) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. 

 The court today separated the trial of Sangeeta on the ground that she was under medical treatment, but framed charges against her husband. 

 The others have been charged under nine sections of the IPC, including 120(b) (conspiracy), 302 (murder), 376 (2) (e) and (g) (rape on pregnant woman and gang rape), and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), said R.K. Shah, the CBI prosecutor from Gujarat. 

 The Supreme Court had transferred the case from Gujarat to Maharashtra in August 2003 after she raised doubts about a fair trial in her home state.

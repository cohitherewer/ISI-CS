The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pamphlet, sweets and an elephant

 ASHISH SINHA

 Laloo: Mass contact

 Garib Chetna rath, Feb. 20: Laloo Prasad Yadav looked fresh after 14 whirlwind election meetings across north Bihar, hopping from one place to another in his helicopter. And then he landed near the Chak Sikandar railway station in Raghopur, his wife and chief minister Rabri Devi?s constituency.

 Entry to his rath was easy as the usual rush of reporters was missing. In fact, Laloo Prasad himself offered a seat beside him to four print journalists, the sum total of the travelling press corps.

 ?Delhi par chadhai kiya, ab Bihar ko badalna hain (We have conquered Delhi, now we have to change Bihar).? These were the first words he barked into a microphone kept in front of the seat that Laloo Prasad occupied. 

 ?The chief minister is your candidate. Let the lantern glow all around. Bhajpa, Jadyu aur Paswan ka balloon phoot gaya (The bubble of BJP, JD(U) and Ram Vilas Paswan has burst). That is why they need cinemawallahs to campaign for them,? Laloo Prasad told the crowd.

 Scores of palms pop up from all over, each wanting to give the RJD president a handshake. Laloo Prasad tried not to disappoint anyone. ?Laloo Yadav bolta hain. Lalten par battam dabana hai (This is Laloo Yadav speaking. You have to press the lantern button),? he keeps on saying into the microphone.

 Someone from the crowd asks for a pamphlet. ?Kya pamphlet chahiye? Hum Laloo Yadav hain, hum hi pamphlet hain. (I am myself a pamphlet),? he tells the man. The RJD president suddenly spots a roadside vendor. ?What are you selling. Oh, khurma (a sweetmeat). Get some for me,? he says and immediately asks his orderly to pay the man.

 Between two stops, Laloo Prasad gets talking with the journalists. ?What do you think of the results?? he repeatedly asks. One reporter says the RJD?s position is not very good. The leader takes his time to reply. ?We will form the government,? he finally says.

 At Deva Chowk, an anxious father tells Laloo Prasad that his graduate son is not getting a job. ?Ask him to sit for competitive exams. We will have many vacancies soon. But is that guy over there selling fish?? he asks, pointing at another vendor.

 A large number of people carrying placards suddenly appear from somewhere. They are demanding a railway halt, to be named after Akshayvat Rai, a local freedom fighter. ?I have registered your demand in mind. Now the model code is in operation. So meet me after the elections,? he tells them. The crowd cheers. 

 The Hajipur nominee, Panchi Lal Rai, is travelling on the rear side of the rath, which has now entered his constituency. ?Dhakadhak lalten par battam lagana. Panchi ko vote dena. Iske paas haathi bhi hain (Press the lantern symbol. Vote for Panchi. He has an elephant too),? he tells a group of women. The nominee owns an elephant and Laloo Prasad thinks that is an attractive idea.

 The RJD chief is passing through Ram Vilas Paswan?s territory and he makes it a point to stop at all villages. ?My appeal is to all,? he tells the reporters. A young man comes with his toddler, seeking Laloo Prasad?s blessing. The leader puts his hands on the child?s head. The father is pleased.

 A few villages later, the rath is back on the highway. Laloo Prasad asks the driver to speed up so that he is home before the 10 pm campaign deadline. But at Dak Bungalow Chowk in the heart of the capital, he stops again. ?Paan le aayo,? he tells the orderly at his favourite betel shop.

 Sex worker shatters an ivory tower

 VEIL LIFTS: A sex worker at a Delhi rally 

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 29: A 152-page book by a street sex worker has smashed the sales record in Kerala, till now held by a Marxist scholar.

 Fifty-one-year-old Nalini Jameelas autobiography exposes like never before how deeply politicians and senior officials in the progressive state ? which tops welfare and literacy charts ? are involved in a flourishing sex racket.

 It was at the states cultural capital of Thrissur that a 25-year-old Nalini was initiated into prostitution.

 A police jeep had taken her and friend Rosa, a veteran in the trade by then, to Ramanilayam ? a government guest house and political beehive ? to serve a senior police officer and a politician.

 Unlike many young women who have been forced or tricked into prostitution by powerful people, however, Nalini says she joined the profession of her own will. She is determined to carry on as long as her body permits. 

 The first edition of Oru Laingigathozhilazhiyude Atmakatha (Autobiography of a Sex Worker) was sold out in less than 10 days. The publisher, DC Books, which had printed 2,000 copies, is planning a second edition soon, publications manager A.V. Sreekumar said.

 Bereft of vulgarity and eroticism, the book is a description of the authors views on sex workers and married women.

 There is no difference between a scientist who uses his brains, a teacher who uses his verbal abilities, a labourer who uses his hands and a sex worker who uses her body, Nalini writes.

 She concedes feminists may not agree with her concept of liberation, but asks: Who else normally enjoys the freedom to select the father of her child? Can an average homemaker walk out of an unhappy wedlock?

 How many women in Kerala have to live with men they dont like, suffering insults, torture and even domestic rape, all because of some false concepts about marital life?

 Nalini was into her third marriage when she decided to become a sex worker. She and Rosa were picked up by the police jeep from a cinema. At Ramanilayam, a haunt of politicians, she was ushered into a room by a khadi-clad man with an imposing personality.

 Ramanilayam has been the hub of many political intrigues. Former chief minister K. Karunakaran used to plan strategies there. Being a government guest house, it used to be a stopover at cheap rates for politicians on the way to the nearby Sri Krishna Temple at Guruvayur.

 DC Books has been getting enquiries about Nalinis book from outside the state. A Tamil weekly has sought the rights for serialising it.

 Sreekumar says the earlier records in the Malayalam publishing industry were held by Marxist ideologue M.P. Parameswaran in the non-fiction category and N.S. Madhavan in fiction.

 VHP bays for Advani blood

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 4: As reports from the RSSs closed-door meet in Surat hinted that it may give L.K. Advani a breather, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) remained firm on its call for Advanis head.

 According to agency reports, Sangh leaders decided that Advani should be allowed to continue as BJP president till the end of the year after he stripped Sudheendra Kulkarni ? the architect of the secular blueprint for the Advani-led BJP? of his official posts as his secretary and the partys national secretary.

 They believed the move indicated that Advani was unwilling to tolerate any public criticism of the Sangh and that his remarks on Jinnah, Ayodhya and Akhand Bharat were an aberration.

 Asked if Kulkarnis sacrifice was atonement enough on Advanis part, senior VHP leader Acharya Giriraj Kishore told reporters: Kulkarni is not even a lamb. He is just a rooster. I believe for a proper, ritualistic sacrifice, you need a bada bakra (huge sheep). 

 Asked if he had Advani in mind, Kishore smiled and said: I dont take names of individuals.

 He added: I do not know if Kulkarni was offered as a sacrificial lamb or a bhiksha (alms).

 Another VHP functionary said a buffalo would have been more appropriate.

 Kishore dismissed Kulkarnis resignation, saying: Was Kulkarni ever a subject of debate? We dont even know who he is. The subject here is of the BJP leadership. 

 But he refused to comment on Advani. Whatever had to be said on him has already been said.

 Asked what kind of leader the VHP wanted for the BJP, Kishore said: A leader who believes in Hindutva. And Advani certainly does not.

 The VHP veteran invoked certain norms and precedents to bolster his demand for Advanis resignation. 

 He said the rule of one-person-one-post had been in place from the Jan Sangh time until the BJP amended its constitution. The RSS is of the view that Advani ought to give up one of his two posts ? BJP president and leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha.

 Kishore also referred to an advisory committee the VHP had constituted during its last executive, which is an adjunct to the Marg Darshak Mandal, its apex steering committee. The advisory committee is meant to give post-retirement jobs and has former VHP president Vishnu Hari Dalmiya and Kishore as members.

 Senior people must be used for their advice and guidance but at the same time, they should make way for the induction of younger persons in official posts, he said. 

 Asked if Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee should also retire, Kishore said: We have set an example, it is for them to follow it.

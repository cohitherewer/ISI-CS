 Push to amend contempt law

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: The United Progressive Alliance is pushing to amend the Contempt of Court Act to make truth a defence.

 The Congress-led government at the Centre had on December 1 reintroduced the amendment bill that is pending in the Lok Sabha. The parliamentary standing committee on personnel, public grievances, law and justice, headed by Congress MP Sudarsana Natchiappan, has now sought suggestions from the public for further amendments.

 The bill proposes to amend Section 13 of the act so that courts will allow ?justification by truth as a valid defence in any proceedings for contempt of court?. 

 Once the bill is passed, a person accused of contempt of court for a comment on a judge or a judgment can place on record the ?truth? as a defence, a course the defendant cannot take now.

 A note issued by the standing committee said the Contempt of Court Act (Amendment) Bill, 2003, ?will enable the courts to permit a defence of justification by truth on satisfaction as to the bona fides of the plea and it being in public interest?.

 The importance of ?truth? as defence in contempt cases involves judges of Karnataka High Court. Several publications had reported on a sex scandal allegedly involving judges of the high court, but it was argued during contempt proceedings that ?truth is not a defence? in such cases.

 However, on appeal last year, the Supreme Court ? then presided over by Chief Justice V.N. Khare ? had orally observed that ?truth is a defence?. Justice Khare had also stated in the open court proceedings that ?truth is a defence but nobody comes forward with the truth?.

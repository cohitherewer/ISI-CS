 Diplomat date for spy

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Aug. 29: Indian diplomats will meet Sarabjit Singh tomorrow, four days after Islamabad granted consular access to him. Sarabjit is on death row in Pakistan after being convicted of espionage and terrorism.

 The meeting will take place tomorrow, Pakistan foreign office spokesman Naeem Khan told reporters in Islamabad. But he did not say where the diplomats will meet Sarabjit, who is in Lahores Kot Lakhpat jail.

 Indian foreign minister K. Natwar Singh had met the Pakistan high commissioner, Aziz Ahmad Khan, in New Delhi on Thursday and asked for consular access to the condemned man. A day later, Pakistan granted the request.

 Pakistans Supreme Court recently upheld the death sentence handed down to Sarabjit by a lower court. Sarabjit had been convicted of being an agent of Indias external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), and of involvement in a series of blasts in Pakistan. He apparently operated in Pakistan under several aliases, including that of Manjeet Singh.

 We are clear that he (Sarabjit) is a terrorist, who carried out bombings in Lahore, Faisalabad and Kasur in 1990, the Pakistan foreign office spokesman said.

 Sarabjits family insists it is a case of mistaken identity. They say the man is innocent and had never worked for RAW.

 Sarabjit can file a review petition in the Supreme Court and also appeal to President Pervez Musharraf to release him or commute his sentence to life imprisonment.

 Some Pakistani lawyers have asked the government to free Sarabjit in exchange for the release of 400 Kashmiris detained in India, a newspaper reported.

 The Daily Times said 17 members of the Lahore High Court bar association have written to the Senates standing committee on foreign affairs, demanding Pakistan strike the deal with India.

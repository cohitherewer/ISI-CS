 Guwahati/Agartala, April 17: The Border Security Force (BSF) today warned Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) against any adventurism along the international border. 

 The warning came a day after an assistant commandant was killed and two others injured near the Tripura border. A group of Bangladeshi civilians, backed by BDR soldiers, had attacked them. 

 BSF director-general R.S. Mooshahary flew back from Dhaka today amid escalating tension along Tripura?s border, where the guards have been put on maximum alert.

 A DG-level meeting between the BSF and BDR was held in Dhaka yesterday. 

 Mooshahary stated in Guwahati that the BSF had exercised utmost restraint yesterday. But he pointed out that if Bangladesh did not stop such adventurism in the future, the BSF would be compelled to take stern action.

 A Bangladeshi girl was also injured as she was caught in the border crossfire, he added.

 Mooshahary clearly told his Bangladeshi counterpart that such incidents would not help in building a conducive atmosphere for friendship.

 The meeting failed to make much headway as Bangladesh did not give a ?positive response in resolving contentious issues, such as handing over Indian militant leaders taking shelter in that country, destroying militant camps there and stopping infiltration from across the border?.

 A flag meeting between BSF and BDR officials was held this evening for one-and-a-half-hours at the zero point on the Indo-Bangladesh border at Akhaura near Agartala, but ended inconclusively.

 Referring to the flag meeting, BSF deputy inspector-general R.P. Chowdhury said: ?We talked but the result was zero.?

 BDR commandant at Fakiramura camp, Kumurajjaman Khan, had showed marked reluctance to hold a flag meeting. BSF officials at Lankamura camp, where assistant commandant Jeevan Kumar was posted, finally persuaded him.

 While the bodies of injured jawans were recovered late at night, the body of Kumar was handed over after the brief flag meeting at Akhaura.

 Speaking to mediapersons after the meeting, BDR sector commander Jahangir Alam said the force ?sincerely condoled? the death of the Indian official who had ?trespassed into our territory?.

 But his claim was disputed by sources in Agartala. It also became clear that BDR jawans hacked and shot to death the BSF assistant commandant and injured two other jawans. 

 Sources in Lankamura said Kumar, who hailed from Ranchi, was known for his relentless drive against smugglers. 

 West Tripura district magistrate J.K. Sinha visited the Lankamura area this morning.

 Delhi clears air on tribes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The government today released 2001 Census figures for rare Andaman and Nicobar tribes along with a preliminary assessment of the situation in the islands to clear the confusion over the fate of the tribals.

 Although initial fears that the killer waves may have wiped out many of these primitive tribes have proved wrong, the authorities do not yet have a clear picture of the exact extent of the devastation. Many of these tribals have fled to the thick tropical jungles in the remote archipelago and the Centre is in no position to say how many have been killed.

 There are six main tribes living in the islands. Of these, five ? Andamanese, Jarawas, Onges, Sentinelese and Shom Pens ? are primitive. The sixth, Nicobarese, are numerically the largest.

 According to the 2001 Census, the Andamanese numbered 43, Jarawas around 240, Onges 96, Sentinelese 39, Shom Pens 398 and the Nicobarese 28,653.

 The Andamanese, most of whom lived in Strait Island, are safe, though their dwellings have been damaged.

 The Jarawas, who like the Andamanese have a Negrito origin, are all safe, according to the authorities. Among the most primitive tribes, they live in six villages in Andaman.

 Latest reports say the Onges ? who live in two villages in Port Blair ? are safe and have taken shelter in the hill and forest areas.

 So far, no contact has been established with the Sentinelese, who shun links with the outside world. However, they have been sighted during aerial surveys over the North Sentinel island. The Centre assumes the Sentinelese are safe.

 The Shom Pens, who live in the southernmost part of Nicobar island, are scattered over 17 villages. All bridges in this area are damaged and efforts are on to reach the Shom Pens by foot. Although they were feared to have been the worst affected, aerial surveys have shown they are more or less safe as they had fled to the forests. 

 The Nicobarese are the worst affected. At least 3,000 of them are missing.

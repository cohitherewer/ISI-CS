 Salman tape pits cop vs cop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 19: Investigation into the Salman tapes has pitched Mumbai crime branch officials against three of their colleagues. 

 A crime branch team yesterday interrogated former deputy commissioner Pradeep Sawant in August 2001, the time when the alleged conversation between Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai was recorded. Sawant supervised most encounters conducted by the police from 1999 to 2001 in which over 300 alleged gangsters were gunned down.

 The investigating officers today summoned encounter specialists, police inspector Pradeep Sharma and sub-inspector Daya Nayak to the crime branch to record their statements. 

 Sharma and Nayak worked at the Andheri crime branch unit and had conducted the phone-tapping operations of the Bollywood-underworld nexus probe involving diamond merchant and film financier Bharat Shah. The two had tapped the phones of several film personalities.

 The police team questioned Nayak and Sharma if the purported conversation between Salman and Aishwarya was recorded as part of those investigations. They also asked them if clearances required under the Indian Telegraph Act were taken before the phones were tapped. 

 The conversation is believed to have been recorded between August 28-30, 2001, months after the police filed the chargesheet in the Bharat Shah case on March 30, 2001.

 According to procedure, lower-rung officials conduct the actual phone-tapping but the proposal has to be mooted by the deputy commissioner. After that it has to be approved by the joint commissioner, the commissioner of police and home department officials.

 Legal experts say police officers can avail of emergency powers to tap phones in extraordinary circumstances, but post facto approval requires to be taken within a fortnight.

 Questions whether Sharma and Nayak had acted independently or with permission remain unanswered.

 Sources said that to prevent unauthorised phone-tapping, the department had centralised the electronic surveillance systems at Crawford Market headquarters in 2003.

 This means that in August 2001, the crime branch had a decentralised structure for electronic surveillance, and each of the 11 crime branch units independently monitored phone-tapping operations.

 The Salman tapes continued to rock the Assembly. BJP leader Gopinath Munde accused the police of dilly-dallying to protect its image. Munde presented the Speaker with a CD containing a recording of the alleged conversation and demanded a CID inquiry.

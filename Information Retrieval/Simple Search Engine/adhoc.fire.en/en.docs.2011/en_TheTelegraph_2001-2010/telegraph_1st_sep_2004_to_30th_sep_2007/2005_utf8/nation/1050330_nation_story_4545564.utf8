 Abuse after steal slur

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, March 29: An eight-year-old girl who worked at a household in Jaleswar town of Balasore district has become the latest victim of violence on domestic helps in Orissa.

 The employers of Naseema Begum, a married couple, have been accused of scalding the girl with a cooking utensil after they suspected her of stealing a gold chain.

 Daughter of a rickshaw-puller, Naseema had been working as a maid-cum-babysitter in the house of Abdul Safiq alias Haku since January. The girl lived in the Tihidi area of Bhadrak district before one Akhtar Begum brought her to the Safiq household. 

 When Safiq?s wife Hafiza Khatun lost her gold chain in the first week of March, the needle of suspicion pointed at Naseema. Safiq allegedly stripped the girl and tied her up while his wife scalded her with a smouldering utensil. 

 Naseema?s body bore at least eight burn marks. ?I repeatedly told them that I did not steal the chain. I begged them to let me go; but they wouldn?t listen to me,? Naseema told Jaleswar police while showing the wound on her neck. 

 ?It was barbarism at its worst. The woman seems to be of sadistic nature,? said Balasore superintendent of police Sanjeev Panda, who has ordered a search for the absconding couple.

 The police on Sunday lodged a case under Sections 354, 506, 323 and 342 of the Indian Penal Code against Khatun and Safiq. They could also slap Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act on the two accused after their arrest, Panda said.

 Though Safiq?s neighbours could hear the cries of the girl, nobody came to her rescue. The couple did not take the girl to a doctor and instead tried to heal her wounds at home. After Naseema?s condition improved a little, Safiq took the girl and dropped her at a market in Tihidi. 

 Naseema managed to reach her village, where she recounted the torture tale before her parents. Her father Sk Tayub then lodged a case with Tihidi police, which transferred the same to their Jaleswar counterparts.

 In June last year, a similar tale emerged from Nuapada district. A member of a former royal family and his wife had allegedly tortured their eight-year-old domestic help, Prashant Nahak, at the Khariar palace. 

 In the same month, Rayagada police arrested a couple on charges of torturing a 12-year-old Dalit girl who worked in their household.

 Worm lurks behind chick lure

 Chennai, Feb. 7 (PTI): A new computer worm that spreads through MSN Messenger is likely to tempt Internet chat users with ?sexy? images, a Chennai based anti-virus software firm has warned. 

 ?The worm attempts to send copies of itself in different file names to all online contacts, pretending to be alluring images,? said the firm. 

 ?MSN Messenger users get a comical photo of a roasted chicken with a bikini tan line. The worm also bears the agobot worm as part of its payload, capable of opening the backdoor on infected systems,? added Trend Micro, issuing a ?medium risk? alert.

 Sightings of the worm have been reported in Taiwan, China, Korea and the US. 

 When a PC is infected, the memory resident worm (worm_bropia.F) drops a copy of itself in the Windows system folder and tries to propagate to other MSN Messenger users by sending a copy of itself under other file names.

 ?The worm also executes a file called sexy.jpg, which displays a photo of a chicken that appears to have been cooked in the oven with its bathing suit on,? the company said.

 Potboiler chase

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 29: Picture this: a traffic policeman astride the bonnet of a speeding Mitsubishi Lancer, holding on to its windscreen wipers.

 A scene from a Bollywood potboiler? No, a real one that was played out on a busy road in the capital last week, starring a traffic constable trying to get hold of a driver without a licence.

 Sandesh Kumar, recently posted at the Chanakyapuri traffic circle, got into the act after Somesh Kumar Dua, who was driving the Lancer, ignored his colleague?s order to show him his licence.

 Sandesh put his commando training to good use and jumped on to the bonnet of the car and grabbed the wipers. What would have been a minor offence soon turned out to be big trouble for Dua, who was booked by Chanakyapuri police for attempt to murder and obstructing a public servant from performing his duty.

 A resident of Pitampura and the owner of a jewellery shop in Karol Bagh, Dua was stopped by the traffic policemen at Shantipath on Wednesday evening and asked to show his licence. He was not carrying his licence and tried to speed away. 

 Sandesh, who has been trained by the elite National Security Guards and completed a stint at the Prime Minister?s house as a commando last July, stepped in front of the car, police said.

 Dua drove over his right leg, after which the constable leapt to the bonnet. An undeterred Dua accelerated further, even jumping over three or four speedbreakers.

 The mad ride continued for another 2 km till the car neared Jesus and Mary College, where other vehicles on the road forced Dua to stop.

 The jewellery shopowner was soon arrested. During interrogation, Dua said he had acted out of panic as he did not have his licence. 

 A city court granted him bail on Thursday.

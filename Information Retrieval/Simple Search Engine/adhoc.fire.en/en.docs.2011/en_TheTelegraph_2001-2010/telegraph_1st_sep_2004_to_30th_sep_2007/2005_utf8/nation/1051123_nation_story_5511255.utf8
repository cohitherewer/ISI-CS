 Centre counts costs and benefits of Lalu loss

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: In hindsight, two submissions ? one from Sonia Gandhi and the other from the Left ? signalled that the UPA was heading for a rout in Bihar, according to Congress sources.

 The Congress president said in response to a question last week that she did not share 100 per cent the optimism of her colleagues and her ally of a victory.

 The Left said it would avoid a confrontation with the government on the issues that had exercised it in the recent past ? the Iran vote and the proposal to sell stake in profit-making non-navratna companies. 

 The Left would not have toned down its stance had it not sniffed an NDA win and the prospect of a BJP revival in the heartland. It realises that the BJP is keen to exploit the political divisions in the UPA. The Left will not want to compound this mess by making things tougher for the government, a source said. 

 The Congresss reading was the Lefts change of heart was brought about by the perception that it was placed in a dream situation now of exercising power without responsibilities and authority without accountability. 

 Were the Left to force a mid-term election, the dream can evaporate. A cabinet minister said: The UPA is united. Soon, the Congress and Left will be pitted against one another in Bengal, Tripura and Kerala. The Mohun Bagan and East Bengal teams are the bitterest of rivals on home turf, but if they have to play against a national team, they become one. The analogy holds true when we see the BJP emerging on the horizon.

 As the BJP leaders predicted the beginning of the end for the UPA, the view from the Congress and the Left was Lalu Prasads defeat would cement the alliance, although for different reasons.

 Off the record, most Congress leaders sounded jubilant that the RJD chief ? who, rightly or wrongly, was regarded as a tormentor of its leaders ? had to eat crow.

 A senior functionary distributed copies of a pre-poll projection done by an unknown pollster last month, predicting a majority for the NDA. He said he would have gladly distributed sweets, too, had it not looked so improper.

 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh ? who was criticised by his colleagues for being a tad too indulgent towards Lalu Prasad ? put up a brave face and said the party would not ditch him. We do not ditch dependable allies. Winning and losing is a part of politics, he said.

 While Singh admitted that 15 years of anti-incumbency was tough to buck, he took a swipe at the LJP chief, Ram Vilas Paswan, and the CPI for dividing the secular vote. 

 However, sources in the Congress, the Left and the RJD said the blame game the major players resorted to today would not affect the governments stability. CPI secretary D. Raja said it was unfair to single out his party and the LJP, calling the verdict a negative vote for a negative alternative.

 The more objective view emerging from the Congress was that while the party could have the vicarious pleasure of seeing Lalu Prasad tamed, it would not help in the long run to have an enfeebled ally in a crucial state like Bihar.

 The RJDs revival, stressed sources, was absolutely necessary before the next Lok Sabha elections if the UPA was to have a fighting chance of retaining power.

 Look at the map. The Congress is non-existent in the heartland, barring the two small hill states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal and Haryana, said sources.

 They conceded that a revival eluded the Congress in Uttar Pradesh as local politics is still polarised between the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. The 2007 Assembly elections could end up seeing these two parties in the fray.

 As of now, the Congress ruled out an alliance with either. If we have to register our presence in Bihar, we have no choice but to bank on Lalu Prasad, said sources. 

 Therefore, they said the best political course was to retain Lalu Prasad and Paswan in the UPA. A cabinet minister said: The two may have fought each other but so did the CPM and the CPI. But this does not stop (CPI leader) A.B. Bardhan from attending the coordination committee meetings.

 Officially, the Congress said issues like the continuance of Paswan could be discussed. However, it added that there are certain things we say during an election campaign, which should be seen as part of the campaign. 

 With Lalu Prasad keeping mum on Paswan, the sources maintained there would be no problems for some time.

 The crunch, they said, would come if the prospective Bihar government started targeting RJD leaders and workers and slapping charges against them. How far will the Centre go to protect us? asked an RJD leader.

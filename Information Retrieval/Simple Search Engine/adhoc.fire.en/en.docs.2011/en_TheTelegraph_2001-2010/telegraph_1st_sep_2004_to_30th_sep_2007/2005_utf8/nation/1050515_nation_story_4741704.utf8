 Shakuntala alleges 

she was threatened 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, May 14: Shakuntala Verma, the crusader against child marriage who had her hands chopped off on May 10, today said she had been threatened on May 3 when she went to a village to campaign against the social evil.

 The statement, her first since the attack, has provided a crucial lead to police who claim they are on the verge of arresting the assailant. I took the threat lightly as I never thought they would actually carry it out, Shakuntala said.

 She told police that a man who had originally tipped her off about a likely child marriage had turned against her after his name was leaked to community leaders. The man, around 35, is in police custody though he has not been formally charged.

 Shakuntala criticised the local administration for claiming that the attack was the result of personal enmity or a love affair. Even chief minister Babulal Gaur had suggested the attack could be the result of personal enmity.

 Shakuntala denied she had any enemies. All I can say is that the attack on me is directly linked to my campaign against child marriage.

 Her daughter Raina said once her mother recovers, she would prevail upon her to quit as supervisor in the states department of women and child welfare. What is the point of working for an organisation that does not stand by its employees? she said alluding to Gaurs statement.

 Shakuntala said she was combing her hair on Tuesday when a man of around 24 approached her, apparently looking for an address, and then attacked her with some sharp weapon, perhaps a sword.

 Alarm rings on illegal mining

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, May 7: A series 

 of devastating landslides and quakes could hit eastern India, 

 killing hundreds of thousands, unless rampant illegal mining 

 is stopped, a petitioner has told the Supreme Court.

 The court gave the director-general, mines safety, three months to file a report on this after the public interest litigation contended that the destruction would be a national disaster ?worse than the tsunami?.

 Petitioner Haradhan Roy, former CPM Lok Sabha member from Raniganj, said illegal mining that flouts all safety norms could turn the eastern region ? particularly the coalfields of Raniganj, Jharia, Asansol and Dhanbad ? into a ?firebowl?, endangering not only people but the entire vegetation.

 He submitted the report of the parliamentary sub-committee on coal (part of the standing committee on energy), which maintains that the situation ?may lead to one of the greatest economic disasters in the country?.

 ?Major railways like grand chord and national highways, which are the lifelines of the country, besides other traffic network, shall be destroyed,? warns the report, titled ?Preliminary Material on Environmental Measures and Subsidence Control in Mines?. 

 ?Lakhs of people shall face danger due to the after-effects of the fire in the long run, virtually turning these coalfields into a firebowl,? it adds.

 Tapash Ray and L.C. Agrawala, the counsels for Roy, told the three-judge bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde, S.B. Sinha and Ashok Mathur at the May 5 hearing that the ?flagrant? breach of mine safety laws was a violation of the fundamental rights of eastern Indias populace.

 The petition said a group of consultants had suggested a ban on new construction over areas declared unsafe, but it was being ignored. 

 He sought a direction from the court to the Centre to state on affidavit the decisions it had taken to avert a disaster, the reports it had placed before Parliament on this, and the nature of the work carried out in the eastern coal belts.

 Left avoids Iran battle 

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: The Left parties will meet tomorrow to decide their strategy on Iran. Their leaders, however, have indicated they may not press for a vote during a discussion on the subject in Parliaments winter session.

 The Left has served a notice for a short discussion on Indias vote against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in September. But it has done so under rule 193, which does not provide for voting.

 CPM boss Prakash Karat said Left leaders did not plan to meet the Prime Minister to discuss the issue. We have no plans to meet the Prime Minister now, he said.

 Neither the ruling alliance nor the Left is keen to be thrown into a situation where they might have to slug it out on the floor of Parliament. Both hope there will be no voting at the next IAEA meeting on November 24.

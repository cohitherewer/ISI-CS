 Bride walks out over dowry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Varanasi, Feb. 18: Neha Pathak has done after marriage what Nisha Sharma had done before it.

 Angry over demands for more dowry, Neha publicly broke her marriage barely 12 hours after it was solemnised in Cholapur, 4 km from here.

 Delhi girl Nisha had in 2003, broken off her engagement on the eve of marriage after her prospective in-laws continued to pile fresh demands for dowry.

 Neha seethed with anger after overhearing arguments between the elders of the two families over demands for more dowry, including a colour television set. She then refused to accompany her newly-wed husband, Keshavdutt Shukla, to his house.

 Encouraged by the bold act, the bride?s family held 40 members of the groom?s party hostage, demanding return of the money and other items given to them, villagers said.

 According to Varanasi senior superintendent of police S.N. Sawant, those taken hostage were released after the groom and his father, Amarpal Shukla, were taken into custody around 10 pm and a case filed against them under dowry prevention laws.

 The Varanasi subdivisional judicial magistrate remanded them in two weeks? judicial custody.

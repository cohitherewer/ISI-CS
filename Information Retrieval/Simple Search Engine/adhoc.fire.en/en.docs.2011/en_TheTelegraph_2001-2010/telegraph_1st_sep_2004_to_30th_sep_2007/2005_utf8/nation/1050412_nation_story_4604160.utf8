 Seer case in trial round

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Jayendra Saraswati: Trying times

 Kancheepuram, April 11: The stage is set to ?commit? the Shankar Raman murder case, involving Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati, to the higher sessions court at Chengalpattu that will decide in which court the trial should be conducted.

 Kancheepuram first-class judicial magistrate G. Uthamaraj today posted the ?committal proceedings? to April 13 after the prosecution?s star witness-cum-approver, Ravi Subramanian, was grilled by the defence counsel for nearly two hours. The Chennai-based builder has been absolved of all charges after he turned approver in January.

 The prosecution had already examined Subramanian when he made his deposition before another magistrate on April 7. Today, lawyers for both pontiffs ? Jayendra Saraswati and his junior Vijayendra Saraswati ? and the counsel for the third accused, former Kanchi mutt manager Sundaresa Iyer, grilled the builder. 

 Last month, the seer had petitioned the Supreme Court pleading for shifting the case outside Tamil Nadu as he feared there could be no fair trial in the state.

 Subramanian today said that two sets of payments, allegedly made by the Kanchi seer to him and which were to be given to the gang that killed Shankar Raman on September 3, were made ?more than a month after the murder?. The builder said the first payment of Rs 5 lakh was made on October 6 last year, but could not recall the date of the second payment of Rs 20 lakh. He only said the second payment was made ?by the end of October 2004?. 

 The cross-examination also left some questions unanswered. These include why Subramanian visited the Ganesh temple in Pilliyarpatti in Sivaganga district after the murder of Shankar Raman. The approver has also not specified, either in his earlier statement to police or in his statement recorded before the other magistrate, as to when he was arrested and how long he had been kept in police custody before his arrest was formally shown. 

 Dinakaran, the seer?s counsel who did the bulk of the cross-examination, dubbed Subramanian as a ?tutored witness? of the police. The defence counsel asserted that none of the incidents Subramanian claimed ? including a September 1 meeting at the mutt between him, the killer gang kingpin, Appu, and the seer ? had actually happened. 

 The seer is said to have shown him and Appu the ?final warning letter? from Shankar Raman. The seer wanted ?such letters to be stopped forthwith and to finish off Shankar Raman even if it cost Rs 50 lakh?. Today, too, Subramanian stood by his claim. 

 Uthamaraj has asked both pontiffs to appear at the next hearing.

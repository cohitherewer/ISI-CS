The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 In jail, but still a star 

 - Lack 

 of arrogance disappoints fellow inmates 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Nov. 13: Locked up in a cell with petty criminals, the screen actor and gangsters moll is still a star.

 Monica Bedi sleeps on an ordinary jail bed and shares the same food and bathroom with the rest, but her awed half-a-dozen cell mates are keeping their distance.

 The 200 and odd assorted prostitutes, pickpockets and husband-killers in the other, more crammed, cells in Chanchalguda jails womens wing scrambled for a good look when the VIP detainee went out for a stroll in the corridors.

 They wanted to see what a film actor and mafia dons woman looks like face to face. They were disappointed that Monica is neither a stunning beauty nor an arrogant woman. She even smiled at some of them and said namaste, a jail official said.

 The jail authorities have deliberately kept Monicas cell less crowded and moved her bed a little away to give her a semblance of privacy. But she has to sleep with the lights on, because thats the rule.

 She had a disturbed sleep. She got up only at 7 am, an official said.

 Jail superintendent R. Sharada said Monica has been allowed to keep with her only two of the six bags of clothes she had brought. The remaining four are in the storeroom. After reaching the jail yesterday, Monica had changed into a salwar and kameez.

 On the whole, Abu Salems girlfriend has declined the little offers of special treatment.

 She can have any kind of food as a VIP inmate, but she has chosen to eat the general breakfast of masala rice and tea and lunch of rice and dal. Today being Sunday, dinner will consist of mutton curry with sweets and a banana for dessert, the official said.

 A tight security ring has been thrown around her to ensure she doesnt try to escape or kill herself. She is being accompanied by two women constables round the clock.

 In the afternoon, Monica went to the prison library and borrowed two newspapers and two magazines, including a Hindi film magazine.

 But Monica, who was interrogated at the CBI complex on Friday night and Saturday morning, isnt talking. 

 All we got from her were tidbits of their travels and stay in Portugal. Either she doesnt know much about Salems career of terrorism or has been tutored well by her counsel, an agency official said.

 When her bail plea comes up before the CBI court on Tuesday, the agency will demand her custody. Monica is in judicial remand till November 25.

 Naukrani vs maharani

 KAY BENEDICT 

 Hajipur/Raghopur, Feb. 4: About 40 km from Patna, Raghopur was supposed to be the Rae Bareli of Bihar but it turned out to be a ?land of Ravanas?, especially for the non-Yadav population.

 A 25-km drive on a narrow, potholed and backbreaking road from Hajipur to Raghopur diara gives a clear picture of what Rabri Devi?s ?subjects? think of her. Bishnudeo Rai Yadav, sitting on a charpoi with a group of men at Bilawarpur Govardhan, said: ?We voted for Rabri Devi thinking that she will nurse this constituency. See how Sonia Gandhi has worked for Rae Bareli.?

 The village falls under Biddhupur, a model block. ?But look at our plight now. The primary school across the road has just one teacher,? Yadav said. 

 Another villager, Uma Shankar Chaurasia, said there is no road to go to the nearest railway station, Chakeshkandarpur, and people have to walk 3 km to reach it. 

 The villagers said lack of power supply is another concern for them. ?We watch TV using batteries? Sometimes, we get electricity when we go to sleep. Lack of power is also affecting agriculture in the region,? one of them said. 

 Despite the lack of development and voices against the ?Ravanraj?, Rabri Devi?s victory is a foregone conclusion, thanks to the support of the huge Yadav population. 

 Vijay Shankar, a Dalit activist in Pahadpur, said: ?Even Yadav kids are aggressive. After the killing of a criminal, Rajeshwar Gope Yadav, by another Yadav criminal, there is more tension in the area.?

 The anger against the ?first couple? is such that a small outfit, the Rashtravadi Janata Party, is likely to pit local maid Manju Devi against the chief minister to make it a ?naukrani? versus ?maharani? fight. 

 Accompanied by Laloo Prasad Yadav and brother Subhash Yadav, Rabri Devi today filed her nomination at the Hajipur subdivisional office for the second phase of polls on February 15. 

 Soon after, Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi addressed a meeting at the adjacent Kacheri court grounds. Union minister and RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh was present. The crowd was not impressive and appeared inattentive.

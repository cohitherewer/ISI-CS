 Pranab camp looks for enemy within

 Mukherjee: Whodunit?

 New Delhi, April 14: The Centre may have saved face by reloading the Kargil deal cannon but it has done little to smooth ruffled feathers in the Congress.

 The Centre had first filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court indirectly absolving George Fernandes. However, stung by criticism by allies as well as a section of the Congress leaders, the government yesterday added a supplementary document that promised to look into the role of the former defence minister in several deals.

 But the embarrassing controversy has left behind an air of suspicion in the Congress.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, the target of several pot shots as it was his ministry which filed the affidavits, is understood to be nursing a grievance that some of his own party colleagues might have lent credence to the perception that a clean chit was given to his predecessor.

 The defence minister feels that the original affidavit could not be construed as a clean chit because it had a second part that said five procurement deals have been referred to the CBI.

 Notwithstanding the Congress?s official statements that echoed his position, sources close to Mukherjee said he is convinced some leaders of his party have reinforced the impression that the ministry tried to let Fernandes off the hook.

 Adding to the defence minister?s discomfiture, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Left leaders are understood to have sought clarifications from him when they met informally over breakfast last week at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s official residence. 

 Subsequently, the Prime Minister is understood to have sought explanation from top defence ministry officials on how such an affidavit found its way to the court.

 Law minister H.R. Bhardwaj added fuel to the controversy with his public assertion that the draft cleared by his ministry and the affidavit submitted in the court were different. 

 Congress leaders claiming proximity to Mukherjee are now trying to identify the leaders who tried to tar him. The ?sleuths? have not yet zeroed in on the mastermind, but they have a list of suspects who might have tried to convince Sonia that the original affidavit has caused political damage.

 They also suspect that some of Mukherjee?s own party colleagues in the government could have reasons to get involved in the imbroglio.

 The alleged whisper campaign has coincided with Mukherjee?s emergence as the party?s point man on crucial matters of governance. 

 Recently, as leader of the Lok Sabha, Mukherjee had won the Left?s support for the controversial patents bill after protracted closed-door negotiations.

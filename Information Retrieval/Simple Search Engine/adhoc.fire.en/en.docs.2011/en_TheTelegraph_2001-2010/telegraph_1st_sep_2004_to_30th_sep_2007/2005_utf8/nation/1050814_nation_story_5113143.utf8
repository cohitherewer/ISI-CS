 Time to read riot act in Lanka, feels Delhi 

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: India feels it is time the Sri Lankan government as well as the international community should read out the riot act to the Tamil Tigers and redefine the peace terms to the rebels.

 Delhi has not officially blamed the LTTE or anybody else. But after the brutal assassination of foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, it wants a strong signal to the Tigers that such violent acts in future would lead to global isolation.

 Kadirgamar, a hardliner who helped outlaw Tamil Tiger rebels internationally and was long seen as a prime target, was shot dead yesterday by a sniper at his heavily guarded Colombo home.

 In a brief but strongly worded statement, India today unreservedly condemned the assassination. Although it did not name the LTTE, it expressed hope that the perpetrators of the terrorist crime will be brought to justice.

 Delhi made it clear that the assassination was aimed at undermining Sri Lankas unity and political stability and maintained that it will not support any move for a separate Tamil Eelam.

 The Government of Indias support for the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka remains constant and undiluted, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said while reading out the statement this afternoon.

 This is a known Indian position but that Delhi decided to repeat it now was a clear signal to the rebels what its stand is on the issue.

 The statement expressed hope that the Sri Lankan government will overcome the challenge posed by the assassination by making sure that the peace process remains on track. 

 Sources in the Indian government said it was for Colombo and the international community to turn the heat on the Tigers. But, at the same time, it was important that the LTTE does not break away from the talks for a peaceful settlement of the ethnic conflict that has claimed thousands of lives.

 Although the Sri Lankan government has not yet blamed the LTTE, its army has clearly said the Tigers are behind the killing. Sources in Colombo said the Tigers may have denied any involvement, but the assassination bore the hallmark of the LTTE.

 The sources pointed out that though it was the first time that a sniper had killed a senior political leader, similar tactics had been used against army officials when the Indian Peace Keeping Force was deployed in the eighties.

 Kadirgamar, they added, was killed not only because he was one of the strongest opponents of the Tamil Tigers but also because the LTTE wanted to return to the limelight. 

 With the focus being on the coming presidential elections, the Tigers, the sources said, were getting increasingly agitated that their demands were being pushed to the backburner by President Chandrika Kumaratunga and the leadership in Colombo.

 An official announcement is likely on the dates of the presidential polls by next week.

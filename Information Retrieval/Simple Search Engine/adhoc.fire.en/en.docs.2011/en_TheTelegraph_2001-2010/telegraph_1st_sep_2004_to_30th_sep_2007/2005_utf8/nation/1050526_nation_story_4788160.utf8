 Siliguri boy battered to death in school clash with SFI

 Sonu Kumar Patel

 Siliguri, May 25: A student 

 of Class X died today after a clash with SFI activists who 

 had gone to Siliguri Hindi High School to enforce a strike.

 Sonu Kumar Patel was rushed to hospital after the brawl outside the school campus, off Burdwan Road, but did not survive.

 The Chhatra Parishad and the Trinamul Congress have called separate bandhs tomorrow and on Monday.

 According to students and teachers, about 16 activists of the Students Federation of India, the CPMs students wing, descended on the school around noon. While nine of them entered the chamber of teacher-in-charge Satyen Banerjee to protest against the recent fee hike announced by the management, the others went around telling students they should immediately vacate the classrooms as a strike was on.

 While some students started coming out, others, in particular Class VII and X students, told the SFI members that they would have nothing to do with the strike, said A.K. Dwivedi, a senior teacher of the school.

 Sensing trouble, the teachers are understood to have told the SFI members that they could talk to the students during the tiffin break.

 When the bell rang for the break at 1.40 pm, the students came rushing out of their classrooms. In the rush, a student is believed to have accidentally collided with an SFI member, who was waiting in the veranda with his group. This led to a full-blown fight.

 As the SFI members ran out of the campus the students gave chase. In the fight that followed, Sonu was badly beaten up. He was rushed to Paramount Hospital, where he died.

 An FIR has been lodged with the Siliguri police station, but no names have been mentioned in it. We are, however, looking for one individual who we believe did Sonu to death, said additional superintendent of police Tripurari. He said no members of the SFI have been arrested yet.

 The incident has been widely condemned by the local units of the Trinamul and the Chhatra Parishad.

 The CPM denied the involvement of its students wing. There is no SFI hand in the incident that occurred outside the school, said CPM state committee member Jibitesh Sarkar. It is unfortunate that a section of local political leaders are trying to squeeze political mileage out of it.

 Sarkar said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya called up from Calcutta to enquire about the incident. 

 The police have been told to arrest the guilty without delay, he added.

 Trinamul leader Krishna Pal said the incident proves the highhandedness of the SFI in educational affairs. We demand immediate punitive action against those guilty. Also, the police should remain impartial in bringing the offenders to book.

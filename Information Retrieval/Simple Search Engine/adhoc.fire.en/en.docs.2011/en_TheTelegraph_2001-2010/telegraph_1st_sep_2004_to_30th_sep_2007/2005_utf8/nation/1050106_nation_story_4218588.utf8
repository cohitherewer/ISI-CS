 Rescue team on forgotten island

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Cuddalore, Jan. 5: Battered and forgotten, an island in the backwaters of the Bay of Bengal received the first ray of hope 10 days after the deadly tsunami struck.

 A team of personnel from the army, police and the fire services department reached Pillumedu today to look for 56 missing people, Cuddalore district collector Gagandeep Singh Bedi said.

 Largely inhabited by tribals and fishermen, the island has been virtually ?washed away?.

 A central team visiting tsunami-affected areas in Tamil Nadu could not reach Pillumedu, nearly 50 km from here.

 The team was stunned to see the devastation across the state, the worst-hit on the country. Around 606 bodies have been recovered from Cuddalore district alone.

 However, the damage to the livelihood of the fishermen is incalculable. Up to 15,000 tonnes of fish used to be exported annually. ?There is no fish available in Cuddalore today and is being brought here from far away Mumbai and other places,? Bedi said.

 The central team has split into three ? one has gone to Nagapattinam, the most battered district in the state, one is surveying Cuddalore district and nearby Pondicherry and third is in Kanyakumari.

 It was mostly women and children who bore the brunt of the killer waves, Bedi said, adding that 312 women and 170 children have died in this district. 

 The team to Cuddalore is being led by Vijaya Srivastava, the executive director of the Delhi-based Central Social Welfare Board. Srivastava said her team members have not seen such a natural calamity in their lives, it is even bigger than the earthquake that shook Gujarat in 2000.

 Bedi stressed on the damage done to fishery and agriculture, the latter due to sea water intrusion in several places. He said two other islets ? MGR Thittu and Chinna Vaikal in the backwaters near Kille, close to Chidambaram ? have also taken a lot of the tsunami?s fury.

 Most fishermen?s boats are ?beyond repair?, Bedi said. Country boats ? known as kattumaram ? fitted with outboard engines and nets could cost up to Rs 1 lakh each, while the price of the bigger motorised fibre-glass boats could go up to Rs 25 lakh, Bedi explained to the central team.

 It would take considerable amount of money to rehabilitate the coastal belt, he said, urging for generous central assistance. 

 Removing the big boats pose a huge logistical problem as well as cranes cannot be taken to certain places, the district collector said, adding that a 50-tonne crane had to be carried all the way from Chennai port to lift some of the larger boats stuck in the debris.

 C.K. Gariyali, one of the relief commissioners of the state government, told the team about a ?small outbreak of measles? in the district. The Centre should arrange for large quantities of anti-measles and anti-typhoid vaccines besides tablets to prevent cholera, Gariyali added.

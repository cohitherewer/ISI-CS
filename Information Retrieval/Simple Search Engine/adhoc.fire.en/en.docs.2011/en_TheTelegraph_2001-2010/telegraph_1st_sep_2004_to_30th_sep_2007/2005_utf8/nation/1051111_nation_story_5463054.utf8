 Reform wind in defence

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: A committee 

 appointed by the Centre to study the defence industry in 

 the country has recommended sweeping changes aimed at liberalising 

 the sector, involvement of the private sector, stepping 

 up exports and, in general, has made a case for a military 

 industrial complex that can compete globally.

 The committee led by economist Vijay Kelkar submitted its final report to defence minister Pranab Mukherjee this evening. In an earlier and partial report submitted in April, the committee had recommended changes in the procedures for acquiring defence equipment.

 In Part II of the report submitted today, the Kelkar Committee has said ordnance factories and defence public sector undertakings must have greater freedom... to become global players in defence production and be able to effectively perform the role of designer and integrator of large systems and platforms. 

 Large systems and platforms mean critical capital equipment for the war machine such as big artillery guns and warships.

 The Kelkar Committee has recommended that defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) ? like Bharat Dynamics that makes missiles and Bharat Earthmovers Ltd that makes heavy vehicles for the military ? should have the liberty to form joint ventures with private and multinational companies and consortiums and must also be empowered for cross investment in foreign countries for the purpose of obtaining technology.

 The committee held up Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the most high-profile DPSU, as a role model and urged the government to allow all such undertakings to forge alliances like HAL.

 The committee has not restricted itself to recommending policy changes but has also suggested an implementation method. It has said a team should be formed to formulate the changes in policy to facilitate DPSUs and ordnance factories to assume the role of designer and integrator.

 The Kelkar Committee comprised 16 other members, among whom are defence scientists and technologists, bureaucrats and representatives of the Confederation of Indian Industry and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

 It had sub-committees that included all chief executive officers of DPSUs, the directorate general of Ordnance Factories and officers of the armed forces.

 The defence minister was given a presentation on the committees recommendations as Kelkar submitted the report. 

 He said the government will take a view on the recommendations shortly.

 Link just a friend: Jagat

 New Delhi, Nov. 2 (PTI): Foreign minister Natwar Singhs son and Congress legislator Jagat Singh said tonight that the owner of an Indian company which had allegedly paid surcharge to import oil from Iraq was his friend.

 Jagat told a television channel that Andleep Sehgal, owner of Hamdaan Exports which had allegedly paid the surcharge on behalf of Swiss company Masefield AG for the oil import, was his friend but made it clear that does not make me privy to his business dealings.

 He dismissed as total rubbish the Paul Volcker panel report which names his father as a beneficiary of Iraqs oil-for-food programme.

 Jagat said the Volcker committee had not sought any reaction from his father, though it had got in touch with some other individuals and companies named in the report and given them a chance to defend themselves.

 You can make any allegation against anybody.? But you have to substantiate. The report has talked about my father being a non-contractual beneficiary. But what exactly does that mean? They have kept it open-ended, Jagat said.

 Even Russian and French governments have denied similar charges and said the documents and signatures on them were fakes, he said.

 The Congress MLA from Rajasthan said he had no contact, no dealings with and never heard of Masefield AG.

 Jagat said Volcker had never contacted Natwar Singh for his reaction neither on telephone, nor on the Internet and nor through mail. I fail to understand how he could make such a major omission. My father is no ordinary citizen. He is the external affairs minister and has great responsibilities.

 Jagat said he had visited Iraq twice as a Youth Congress member. Once he was part of a Congress delegation led by his father and on another occasion, he attended a youth conference convened by Saddam Husseins Baath Party.

 House statement

 Natwar Singh said today that he has decided to make a suo motu statement in Parliament on the allegations.

 Mumbai, Dec. 7: The court hearing the Bombay blasts case today said charges against Abu Salem would have to be re-framed, raising questions whether he could be kept in custody for that long without being given bail.

 The decision of Justice P.D. Kode of the Tada (anti-terror) court means the verdict in the case, which was to be delivered this month, will be pushed back by five to six months.

 It is a legal requirement. Charges against Salem were framed when he was absconding. Now he has been extradited and is in India. So charges need to be re-framed. It is a technical matter, the dons lawyer, Ashok Sarogi, said.

 Salem is charged with procuring and distributing weapons and explosives that were used to set off the 1993 Bombay blasts and is one of the prime accused in the case.

 The gangster, extradited from Portugal on November 11, is now in judicial custody. As re-framing of charges will take a minimum of five to six months, questions are being asked on what happens to him in the interim.

 The verdict of the 1993 blasts case would automatically be pushed back by some five-six months due to the re-framing of charges. The question is will Salem stay that long in judicial custody? a senior crime branch official asked.

 Sarogi said if that was the case, we will definitely seek bail for Salem at the appropriate time.

 The Tada court today extended Salems custody till December 20 and ordered that he be produced in court on Friday. He is being questioned by the anti-terrorist squad of Mumbai police in connection with builder Pradeep Jains murder.

 The crime branch of Mumbai police, which wants to grill him in the murder of Manisha Koiralas secretary, was today refused custody by the court. It asked the crime branch to file an application after the anti-terrorist squad finishes with him on December 17.

 The Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission yesterday turned down the state governments plea to dismiss a petition filed by Salems brother Abu Lais alleging the don was being tortured in custody.

 Lais also claimed the don could be made a victim of a staged encounter.

 Although the state refuted the charges, the commission said the petition could not be dismissed in the absence of the applicant.

 It asked both parties to file documents to support their respective contentions before Thursday.

 Extra mile to skip search

 Chatterjee: Detour alright

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Bengal Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim might end up losing a few votes but Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee is firm he will not allow himself to be strip-searched on way to Fiji for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association elections.

 Chatterjee has decided not to take the most common Sydney or Auckland routes when he travels to Fiji later this month for the nine-day CPA meeting beginning in Nadi on September 2.

 On the agenda is the election of the CPA executives chairman, slated for September 9, in which Halim is one of two candidates.

 Since Australia and New Zealand do not rule out frisking and strip-search at their international airports even of VIPs on commercial flights, Chatterjee has decided to travel to Nadi via Tokyo, even if it means longer flying hours.

 It is not as though Chatterjee is opposed to intrusive security checks. All he expects is that the two countries should reciprocate the courtesies that India offers their VIPs on arrival in India. India exempts foreign dignitaries from frisking.

 In Australia, only VIPs landing on chartered flights are exempt from frisking. Chatterjee is due to leave for Nadi via Tokyo on August 30.

 Chatterjee had skipped Aprils CPA executive meeting in Sydney on the same grounds. He was to have travelled from Manila to Sydney but chose to return than accept Australian protocol. Australia and New Zealands reaction to Chatterjees stand is not known.

 A few months ago, Parliament had disapproved of George Fernandes being strip-searched in the US when he had gone visiting as defence minister.

 Lobbying is under way by some countries, particularly smaller island nations in the South Pacific, to prop up Cook Islands deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry as a rival to Halim.

 Barring these countries, Halims candidature has been proposed and seconded by countries in every other region, sources said.

 As such, Halim should have a cakewalk in the September 9 voting, they said.

 Many Commonwealth countries have apparently pledged their support for Halim in writing, they said.

 The voting is by secret ballot. The electoral college, which comprises presiding officers of national and state/provincial assemblies from Commonwealth countries, has 277 members. India has 38 votes.

 Sting to sing for Pepsi amp; charity

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: After Bryan Adams, the Rolling Stones and Shaggy last year, Pepsi is celebrating the new year with a concert by Sting in early February.

 Sting will perform in Bangalore 

 on February 4 and two days later in New Delhi.

 The event, which is being promoted by DNA Networks, has Nokia, Hutch and VH1 as associate sponsors.

 Part of the proceeds will go to tsunami survivors in south India, said T. Venkat Vardhan, managing director of DNA Networks. But he did not specify any amount.

 Bringing in international rock stars is proving to be a highly effective way of connecting with the upmarket youth of the country, said Vardhan.

 The Bangalore-based event management company plans to bring in at least two more international music icons this year, though Vardhan did not mention names.

 The managing director said on an average, bringing in an international music icon for a one-night performance costs Rs 5 to 6 crore. 

 Thereafter, the cost escalates by about 25 per cent for each performance.

 Vipul Prakash, executive vice-president of Pepsi Foods Ltd, said music, cricket and movies have always been Pepsi?s platforms to connect with its target population in the country.

 Vardhan said the company plans to take international music icons beyond Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai in the future. In the east, he said, Shillong could be a possibility but ruled out Calcutta as a venue.

 Pak visas hit blast hurdle

 MANAN KUMAR 

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: The Delhi serial blasts could slow down loosening up of the visa regime between India and Pakistan. 

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil hinted at the possibility immediately after an emergency cabinet meeting within 24 hours of the blasts. 

 Patil said mediapersons coming from different areas and countries to Delhi and other metros would be watched closely. Why and how these people were coming would also be looked into, he added. 

 Asked if there would be stricter regulations for foreigners, Patil said details are being worked out. 

 Senior officials said granting of business visas easily to Pakistanis, which was to be discussed at the next home secretary-level meeting between the neighbours next year, may now go into limbo. 

 The two countries were planning to grant multiple-entry business visas to individuals without police verification, basing the screening only on the antecedents of the sponsoring company. 

 The rules could also be tightened for medical and student visas to Pakistanis. 

 According to senior home ministry officials, Delhi is mulling a more stringent screening process for people coming from Nepal and Bangladesh. 

 There is ample evidence that terrorists frequently use the Nepal border to enter India, so the Centre is planning to tighten entry from gateways like Sanauli, Raxaul and Jogbani, they said. 

 The Centre has also woken up to Pakistanis overstaying in India. There are more than 100 such Pakistanis, so instructions may be given soon to the local foreigners regional registration office to look for them.

 Flood PIL

 Mumbai, Aug. 17: Bombay High Court today asked the municipal corporation to come out with the number of people who died during the recent floods without delay, reports our special correspondent.

 The bench of Chief Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice S.F. Vajifdar asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for information within three days about people who have died or are missing.

 The court said the rehabilitation of widows and children should be taken up on a priority basis. 

 The state government should also make it known which officials people can turn to in each ward in such a situation. 

 The next hearing of the PIL, filed by filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt and others, is on August 22.

 Seventeen more people were reported to have died over the past 24 hours, most of them of leptospirosis.

 But the municipality officials said there was an improvement in the health situation. The death figures are showing a steady decline, they added.

 Mumbai, Aug. 5 (PTI) Actor Preity Zinta has lodged a police complaint saying she has been receiving abusive SMSs from an unidentified person for the past few days.

 Zinta said the messages were sent 

 in the names of Bollywood stars, but she suspects it is 

 somebody else trying to trouble her, police sources said 

 today.

 Although she ignored the SMSs initially, the actor decided to approach the police earlier this week when their frequency increased, they said.

 Deputy commissioner of police Amitabh Gupta said the police are trying to identify the cellphone from where the messages are being sent.

 One thing is for sure. The sender is from Pune and the case appears to be similar to the ransom demand made by some college students to another Bollywood actress, Kim Sharma, Gupta said.

 Sources close to Zinta said only a few people have her number. 

 The prankster, perhaps, managed to get hold of it from one of them, they added.

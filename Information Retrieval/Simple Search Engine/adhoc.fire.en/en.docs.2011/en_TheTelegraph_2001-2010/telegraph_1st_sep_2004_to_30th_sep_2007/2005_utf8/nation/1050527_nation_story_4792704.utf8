 IAF chief vows fair probe

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, May 26: The controversy over the general court martial of Anjali Gupta today prompted the chief of air staff to come out with a statement that the flying officer would get justice and will not be harmed.

 We are not at war with Anjali. Why should we harm her? Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi asked in his first public comments on the trial of the woman officer. Gupta is accused of financial irregularities and indiscipline.

 We are very conscious of looking after our own people. We will be open and transparent (in the military court). Please understand that I am the father figure of IAF and she is one of my officers. Everyone who wears this uniform will get justice, he said after a courtesy call on Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh.

 The air force chief will tomorrow unveil a memorial at the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment here for personnel killed in air mishaps.

 Gupta, who was serving at this establishment, was held under close arrest from April 8 to May 24 on its premises. On Tuesday, she was shifted to the air force command hospital for psychiatric evaluation.

 Guptas family has expressed fears that she would be declared mentally ill and unfit to serve the force. 

 Tyagi tried to allay these apprehensions saying the reason a panel of doctors would put her through psychiatric evaluation is to rule out suicidal tendencies.

 If somebody threatens to take her life, will you protect her or keep quiet? For her protection, she was confined to a room with two women escorts, he said.

 These tests have been delayed because of Guptas failure to co-operate with air force personnel, the air force chief said.

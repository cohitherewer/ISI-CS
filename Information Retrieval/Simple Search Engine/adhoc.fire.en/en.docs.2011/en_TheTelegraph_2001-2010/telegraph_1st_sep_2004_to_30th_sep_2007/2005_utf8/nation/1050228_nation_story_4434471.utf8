 All options open in Jharkhand

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi, Feb. 27: At the end of a dramatic Sunday, the election result in Jharkhand appeared more ?open? than ?shut?. 

 With Shibu Soren appealing to Stephen Marandi to ?return home? and Congress poll-managers reportedly opening their arms and purse-strings to a dozen candidates who are believed to be sitting on the fence, the post-poll situation in the state remains pregnant with possibilities.

 Both NDA and the UPA formations declared their resolve to stake respective claims to form the government. BJP leader Rajnath Singh and the outgoing chief minister, Arjun Munda, pointed out that the pre-poll NDA alliance had won more seats (36) than the Congress-JMM-RJD combine (33).

 Soren, however, contested the claim and pointed out that with Forward Bloc(2), UGDP (2), Ajsu (2) and NCP and CPI (ML) winning a seat each, the ?secular bloc? had the mandate to form the government.

 A sombre Soren issued a public appeal asking Stephen Marandi to return to the party. ?Stephen is always welcome in the JMM and he can return whenever he likes,? said Soren and added that the rebel, who defeated the party chief?s son at Dumka, could retain his seat in the Rajya Sabha or in the Assembly.

 Chief minister Arjun Munda and his predecessor Babulal Marandi had a closed-door meeting with Rajnath Singh at a city hotel. The elected members of the NDA, they indicated, would meet in the state capital on Monday and possibly elect a leader. By Monday evening, Rajnath Singh said, the alliance will be in a position to call on the governor and stake claim. 

 ?The NDA is clearly ahead of the UPA and ought to be invited for forming the government and given a chance to prove its majority on the floor of the house,? said the BJP leader. He also added that the party would welcome the ?winning? rebels back into the fold.

 Both Munda and Marandi declared that the issue of who would be the next chief minister is secondary to them and the immediate challenge is to cobble together a majority. Marandi, however, added that he was ready to shoulder any responsibility although he is not in the race for the chief minister?s chair.

 There was hectic political activity in the Congress camp as well with the troika of Imran Kidwai, RPN Singh and Subodh Kant Sahay entrusted with the task of contacting potential supporters. A television channel even went on air and suggested that the Congress had kept a helicopter ready at the Ranchi airport so that it could carry the favourable Independent candidates to a safe house. 

 While the mood in the BJP camp was obviously upbeat, the UPA camp tried hard to put up a brave face to what is seen as a debacle. 

 The Congress tally has actually come down from 11 to 9 in the Assembly, despite a high-profile campaign. Its pre-poll ally, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, has managed to improve its tally marginally from 13 to 17. 

 The uneasy alliance appears to be under considerable strain and the blame-game appears to have started. Even the justification for continuing the alliance with the JMM is being questioned.

 Congress workers blamed JMM?s ?over-ambition? and Soren?s mishandling of the Stephen Marandi episode for the electoral setback. They also blamed their party leaders for choosing wrong candidates. Their ire was specially directed towards Kidwai and Singh, who have been camping in the state capital for the last two months.

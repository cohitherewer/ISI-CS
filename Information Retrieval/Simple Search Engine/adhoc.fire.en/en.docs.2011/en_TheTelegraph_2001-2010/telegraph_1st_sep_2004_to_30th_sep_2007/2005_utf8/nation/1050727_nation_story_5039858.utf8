 Shutdown after protest culture shock

 New Delhi, July 26: Japanese-owned Honda Scooter and Motorcycle India Pvt Ltd today shut down its plant at Manesar near Gurgaon as clashes between its protesting workers and police continued for the second day.

 It has been decided to halt production completely today as there can be some security-related problems. However, this is just a precautionary measure and we hope to resume production again tomorrow, a company official said. 

 The two-wheeler maker, which came under media glare and political scrutiny after the clashes, went into damage-control mode today. 

 The workers had started an agitation in May protesting against low wages and what they claimed was an unjustified policy of keeping workers on tenterhooks by not confirming their jobs. 

 The Japanese motorcycle maker decided to crack down by sacking five employees and suspending three dozen more, while inviting the local police to post a strong picket at the factory gate. This aggravated the situation with most of the 2,500 workers in the plant intensifying their agitation.

 For the Japanese top brass, the workers protests were a culture shock as they were used to workers back home who showed discord with the management by over-producing or wearing black badges. 

 The plant management decided to enforce the discipline it was used to, following up the sackings by asking the workers to sign an undertaking that they would not resort to any more strikes, a thing most workers were unwilling to do. 

 The next step was a virtual lockout by the management early this month when it decided to debar the workers who did not sign the undertaking from entering the plant. 

 Processions, dharnas and gate meetings, scuffles between workers and guards and the police posted at the factory became the order of the day.

 The company managements statement today condemned all acts of violence and expressed deep regret over the injury to the workers. We will provide all medical assistance and hope that our workmen recover quickly and join back soon, the statement said.

 The situation has come to us as a complete surprise and we wish to put it on record that we would continue to look at negotiating with the workmen until a mutually agreeable solution is reached upon, the company said.

 Some outside forces misled our workmen and workers of several other units in Manesar area, leading to an unfortunate incident that saw many of them being injured, it said.

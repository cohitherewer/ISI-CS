 Cloud over Rashid trip

 New Delhi, June 23: India is unlikely to give Pakistani information minister Sheikh Rashid permission to travel by the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus, reports our special correspondent.

 Rashid who was recently involved in a controversy when JKLF leader Yasin Malik said he ran training camps for Kashmiri militants, has applied to come to India by the bus. We have received Sheikh Rashids application which will be processed in due course, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said.

 Though he remained non-committal on whether Rashid will be allowed to travel by the bus, the opinion in the Indian establishment is gathering round to denying him permission to come here by the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus.

 Anjali seeks new defence counsel

 Bangalore: Flying Officer Anjali Gupta 

 told the general court martial trying her on Tuesday that 

 she wanted to withdraw her defence officer because of serious 

 differences between them, reports our special correspondent. 

 She sought seven days time to find a civil lawyer. The presiding officer, Group Captain V. Ganesh, granted her a five-day break ?in the interest of justice and not to prejudice (Gupta) in any manner?. He said it was her ?last and final chance? to find a defence counsel.

 Gupta cited differences with the defence officer, Wing Commander Vijay Bhupesh ? who wanted her to question the jurisdiction of the court martial ? on the ?lines of attack? and ?grounds of attack?.

 ?My lines of defence are different. My interests are at stake. It is a question of my career and my life. Therefore, I seek seven days time to get a defence counsel (a civil lawyer),? she told the court martial.

 The court martial has asked Gupta to appear before it with her defence counsel at 9 am on May 16. She was ordered to depose over the next five days before the court of inquiry set up to probe her charges of sexual harassment against three senior IAF officers.

 Karnataka High Court has declined to admit Guptas petition to stay the court martial proceedings. She was asked to face the court martial, which is trying her for insubordination and financial irregularities, and seek the high courts intervention against its final orders.

 JJs club eyes novel ideas

 New Delhi: General JJ Direct. The army 

 chief is looking for ideas and he will not pull rank.

 The chief of army staff, General Joginder Jaswant Singh, celebrated a Eureka moment on Tuesday and launched his Dreamers Club, a forum for troops and all those interested in the military and with an idea to sell.

 Any idea. Like, at the launch this morning, he commended a soldier who had modified the INSAS rifle, the standard issue weapon for infantrymen, and made the trigger more user-friendly. 

 ?The army is a million-strong. We have a large pool of talent; I want to tap into that. There must be a free flow of ideas,? the chief has told his soldiers.

 General Singhs inspiration for the Chiefs Dreamers Club is a Sergeant Whittle of the Royal Air Force who conceived the idea of the jet engine. 

 But the general has felt that the rigid hierarchy can discourage latent talent. So the Dreamers Club on the army intranet will be made accessible to all troops. Soldiers at division and even some at brigade headquarters can log in and send their ideas to the chief directly.

 Flock of 41 splits to go into hiding

 MANISH SHARMA AMP; RANJAN DASGUPTA

 Jaipur/Jamshedpur, March 4: The BJP alliance?s flock of 41 split into three groups for safe-keeping till the hour of reckoning in the Jharkhand Assembly in much the same secretive manner they reached Delhi from Ranchi.

 One group stayed back in New Delhi while a larger team arrived in Jaipur late on Friday afternoon, escorted by Rajasthan police and Dushyant Singh, son of chief minister Vasundhara Raje. 

 The third gang, presumably comprising the Independent legislators, disappeared en route to an undisclosed destination, escorted by BJP central leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, among others. 

 The BJP handled the mission with great aplomb as party leaders in Delhi solemnly disclosed different destinations ? ranging from Sariska to Nimrana to Jaisalmer ? to different sets of people.

 A resort, about 50 km from Jaipur off the highway to Delhi, was hosting one group. It was at this resort that BJP legislators from Goa had recently put up. In spite of the tight security, which would not allow access to the media, one of the Goa MLAs had managed to strike a deal with the Congress and defected.

 It is difficult to even establish contact on the phone because of poor connectivity to the resort that is surrounded by the Aravalli hills.

 The four-hour drive from Delhi, the legislators confided, was pleasant but tiring for some of the older members. They were also delayed because once they entered Rajasthan, they were stopped at several places by BJP workers and garlanded. 

 ?We were pleasantly surprised by the huge reception. Our bus was stopped at over a dozen places where each one of us was garlanded. We loved every moment of it,? said an MLA. 

 The group had a much-delayed lunch around 6 pm and the menu was simple ? rice, chapati, dal, paneer and gobi-papad. Some of the MLAs took a fancy to mirchi pakodas.

 Enjoying all the fuss over them, some of the MLAs said they expected to have lunch tomorrow with the Rajasthan chief minister and do some sightseeing. 

 Each room at the resort is being shared by two MLAs but no one is complaining. ?The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the Rajasthan unit of the BJP has deployed workers to look after our needs,? said an MLA.

 Soon after they arrived, the MLA from Jamshedpur (West), Saryu Rai, sat down before the television set. Former Union minister Karia Munda headed for the lawns with a group.

 Former chief minister Arjun Munda seldom took his ears off his cellphone. The legislators claimed they were all aware of what was happening in Jharkhand. It is apparently Rai?s responsibility to keep tabs on the developments. 

 They have clearly been briefed against speaking about the Independent MLAs. ?Hum saath saath hain (we are all together)? is all that they were prepared to say but would not allow the media to speak to either Enos Ekka or Harinarayan Rai, the two Independents whose names appear on the lists of both the BJP and the Congress.

 ?We will present them on the right platform and at the right time,? said a terse, even tense, Munda, though his colleagues claimed the former chief minister was ?totally relaxed?.

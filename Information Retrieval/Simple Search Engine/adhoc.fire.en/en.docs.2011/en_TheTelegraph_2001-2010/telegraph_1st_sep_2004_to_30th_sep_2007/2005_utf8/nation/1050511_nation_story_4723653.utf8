 Bad exam? Switch script

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 10: An audacious answer script swap racket has blown up in the face of the prestigious Anna University.

 A handful of students from self-financing private engineering colleges affiliated to the university have been replacing their answer scripts with freshly written ones the night after taking an exam.

 Police said the students have been bribing temporary staff to supply them with fresh scripts, ?rewriting? their exams in peace and quietly swapping them with the originals locked up in the control room.

 Eleven students from two colleges in Chennais suburbs and three daily wagers employed by the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) ? an institute of the university ? have been arrested. Cases have been registered under several IPC sections, including cheating and criminal conspiracy.

 The universitys top officials got whiff of the racket through anonymous phone calls and emails which hinted that answer scripts of a particular zone were being clandestinely ?replaced?.

 On conducting a random check, the authorities found that some bundles of scripts had been tampered with. In case of some scripts, the twine with which individual sheets were tied together had been removed and fresh sheets stapled on.

 Immediately, the university registrar K. Jayaraman and vice-chancellor E. Balagurusamy contacted the police, who swooped on the mischief-makers. 

 Balagurusamy said the students would not have managed to pull through such an audacious operation without the help of ?insiders? who knew exactly where the answer scripts were stored and what security arrangements were in place. He has ordered a state-wide check of all bundles of answer scripts of affiliated engineering colleges.

 A police officer said this is the first time a racket of this nature has rocked Anna University, considered one of Indias leading technological varsities. Script-tampering had earlier been reported from Bharathidasan University and Annamalai University.

 The Anna University was started as a ?unitary type? institution in September 1978, comprising a few top institutes like the MIT. Its main objective was to promote excellence and research in technical education on a par with the IITs and to set high academic standards. But it was forced to switch to an ?affiliating type? of university under pressure from self-financing engineering colleges that mushroomed in the nineties.

 Official figures said Anna University became a ?very large affiliating-type university? from December 2001, bringing into its fold about 226 self-financing engineering colleges, three government-aided and six government colleges.

 The university also conducts the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examination every year which is taken by about 1.5 lakh students from the state alone. 

 Known for its high standards and held in good esteem in the US, most self-financing colleges want to be affiliated to the university. In the last academic year, about 2.2 lakh undergraduate and 10,000 postgraduate students took exams in about 1,500 subjects in 37 UG and 47 PG engineering programmes.

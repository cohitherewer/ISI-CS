 DMK looks to Italy to heal Cong rift

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Dindigul (Tamil Nadu), March 12: The DMK is going Italian to woo the Congress.

 Desperate to cement the cracks that appeared after Congress minister E.V.K.S. Elangovan?s outburst against M. Karunanidhi, the DMK seems to have found an ingenious way to mend ways with Sonia Gandhi?s party. 

 A key constituent of the Congress-led UPA coalition at the Centre, the party has built a facade of an Italian palace at the venue of its two-day conference.

 At a remote village in drought-prone Dindigul district, a DMK flag flutters on the imposing facade of the Renaissance palace that owes its inspiration to Michelangelo ? a symbol far removed from the replicas of Parliament or some Tamil king?s insignia that party workers are used to.

 The principal organiser of the meet, the DMK?s Dindigul district secretary, I. Periyasamy, is unwilling to say much about the ?palace? at the entrance to the Anna Nagar venue, about 15 km from here.

 When Elangovan demanded that the state Congress press for a coalition government in Tamil Nadu after the Assembly elections due in 2006, the DMK not only threatened to pull out its ministers from the Manmohan Singh cabinet, but also went on to pass a resolution asking the Congress high command to take action against the minister. 

 The resolution was unexpected as both Sonia and Singh had expressed their regrets to Karunanidhi for Elangovan?s comments. It enraged some senior Congress leaders in the state, who said the DMK was trying to ?interfere? in the party?s internal affairs.

 Last week, Elangovan called on the 82-year-old DMK patriarch and the party dropped its demand for action against the minister. Although Karunanidhi said the ?chapter was closed?, it left a sour taste in the Congress-DMK relationship.

 The DMK, through its monumental gesture, is now hoping to steady the boat. 

 Just as the DMK?s support is crucial for the Congress at the Centre, Karunanidhi, too, needs to keep the Democratic Progressive Alliance led by his party intact in the state. The coalition, forged during the last Lok Sabha elections, includes the Congress, PMK, MDMK and the Left parties.

 There is trouble from outside as well. ADMK chief Jayalalithaa is allegedly trying to draw a wedge between the DMK and the state Congress. 

 Taking no chances, the DMK has made this conference a power-packed affair with special addresses by state Congress president G.K. Vasan, MDMK chief Vaiko, PMK leader S. Ramadoss along with Left leaders on the second day.

 The need to mend the rift notwithstanding, Karunanidhi today expressed disdain at the ostentatious display. The Dindigul-Madurai National Highway has been dug up on both sides to erect poles to fly flags. A 36-km stretch has been illuminated by tube-lights. 

 An annoyed Karunanidhi, as he walked to dais today, asked party workers to remove a luxurious sofa. He opted for an ordinary wooden chair instead.

 Farmhouse weddings on, with road rider

 New Delhi, Dec. 6 (PTI): Delhi High Court today allowed weddings and other social events to be held for the time being in farmhouses facing at least 60-foot-wide roads, relaxing its earlier ban on such use of the properties in violation of the Delhi Master Plan.

 The order came from a division bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Rekha Sharma. 

 The bench stayed the Municipal Corporation of Delhis (MCD) decision to allow soc-ial functions in farmhouses facing roads that are 30 feet or more wide.

 The court asked the MCD and the Delhi Development Authority to conduct a survey to identify the farmhouses that could be allowed to organise social functions.

 The bench also issued a contempt notice to MCD commissioner Ashok Kumar for allegedly failing to implement its July 6 order banning use of farmhouses for social events in violation of the Delhi Master Plan.

 After Bhrashtachar Virodhi Sangathan alleged that the order was being violated with impunity, the bench sought Kumars personal presence on January 13, the next date of hearing.

 The court made it clear today that except to the ext- ent relaxed, its order would continue to be in force and said goods would be seized from farmhouses flouting the order.

 The MCD had been seeking modification of the July 6 order since September, demanding permission to continue social functions in farmhouses, banquet halls and parks till December 2006.

 The bench has sought a fresh reply from the government on whether any steps were taken as directed by it to appoint a special officer to ensure compliance of its earlier directive.

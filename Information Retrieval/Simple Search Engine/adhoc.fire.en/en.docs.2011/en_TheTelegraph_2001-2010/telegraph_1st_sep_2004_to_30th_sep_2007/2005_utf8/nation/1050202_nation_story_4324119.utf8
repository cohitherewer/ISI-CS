 Charter of dissent for Laloo

 FARHANA KALAM

 Patna/Gaya, Feb. 1: Muslim organisations in Bihar appear almost as desperate as Rashtriya Janata Dal strongman Laloo Prasad Yadav. 

 The latter, sensing that Muslims are wavering in their support, has taken the desperate step of inviting maulanas and Muslim organisations from outside the state, including Salauddin Owaisi from Hyderabad, to pledge their support for him.

 A recent meeting of Muslim organisations in Patna witnessed sharp differences though pro-Laloo clerics did succeed in getting a resolution adopted that defeating communal forces was still a high priority. Not everyone agreed.

 Maulana Abdul Sami Jafri, head of the Wahabi sect, kept away from the meet on the alibi of poor health. Sanaullah Rizwi, head of the Adara-e-Shariah, refused to give his consent and reserved his decision.

 Meanwhile, United Muslim Morcha, the organisation espousing the cause of Dalit Muslims, has come out with a nine-point ?chargesheet? against the RJD government in the state.

 The morcha ?chargesheet? says no less than 48 per cent of Muslims in Bihar live below poverty line and more than 50 per cent do not know how to read or write. 

 It further says no less than 252 members of the community have been victims of 130 incidents of communal violence in the state in the Laloo Prasad-Rabri Devi regime. Of the total 82,031 killings that have taken place in the state in the past 15 years, no less than 26,000 victims have been Muslims, the morcha says.

 If Ejaz Ali?s ?chargesheet? is to be believed, RJD supporters have grabbed no less than 400 grave yards in the state. Besides, 2,370 units of real estate belonging to the WAKF have also been grabbed, with 1,670 of the grabbers being RJD members. It adds that victims of the Bhagalpur riots are yet to get justice and the closure of handlooms and powerlooms has rendered 9 lakh weavers jobless.

 Ejaz Ali prefers the MD (Muslim-Dalit) combine to the existing MY (Muslim-Yadav) and has launched a campaign for a non-BJP, non-RJD alternative for the state.

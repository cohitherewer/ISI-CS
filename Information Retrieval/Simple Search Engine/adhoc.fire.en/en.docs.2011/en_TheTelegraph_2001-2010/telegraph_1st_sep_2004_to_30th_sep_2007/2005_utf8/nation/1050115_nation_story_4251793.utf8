 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 14: Aided by the economic upturn and alumni support, Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB), has emerged as the favourite hunting ground for corporate recruiters this year.

 The placement season, which came to an end on January 8, saw 113 of its 116 students landing jobs with frontline information technology, finance and FMCG companies, among others. But what takes the cake is the highest pay offered to an XIMB student in the institute?s history.

 Silicon Valley-based company Sierra Atlantic has hired three students of the institute with an annual pay package of $84,000 (Rs 40 lakh) each. The three students are Pijush Gupta, Parag Dave and S. Narayan. Last year, the highest pay packet on offer was Rs 12 lakh per annum.

 This year, the highest salary offered by an Indian company was Rs 9 lakh. The offer was made by Wipro Technologies to Satyanarayan P. Jayapaul.

 Director of XIMB Fr E. Abraham said there were 198 offers for 113 students this year. ?2005 is one of the best placement years for us considering the kind of companies that visited the campus, the job profiles and the pay packages offered,? said Muktikanta Mishra, head of the XIMB placement cell. 

 This year, the average pay packet was Rs 5.24 lakh compared to Rs 4.65 lakh last year. On account of the deluge of offers, 14 of the 59 companies that participated in the placement had to return empty-handed, he added. 

 Mishra revealed that the demand was especially high in the IT and marketing sectors this year. Among the IT companies, the star recruiters were Infosys (16 offers), Tata Consultancy Services (nine) and Polaris (six).

 Among the companies that offered marketing jobs were Marico Industries, Britannia, Godrej Consumer Products and CavinKare. 

 Among the leading financial and banking institutions that visited the campus were HSBC, KPMG, Batliwala and Karani, HDFC, Kotak Bank and IDBI. The students have been recruited as business analysts, project consultants and deputy managers.

 Besides, manufacturing concerns like Larsen and Toubro, Tata Steel and Aditya Birla and consultancies such as Mckinsey, Frost amp; Sullivan and PricewaterhouseCoopers also visited the campus. 

 Mishra pointed out that IT companies (42 per cent) banking and finance organisations (20 per cent) and FMCG firms (17 per cent) were the leading recruiters this year.

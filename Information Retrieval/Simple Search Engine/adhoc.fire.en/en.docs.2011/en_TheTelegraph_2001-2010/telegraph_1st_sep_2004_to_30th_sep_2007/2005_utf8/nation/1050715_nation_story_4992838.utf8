 Temple bar on Kanchi seer

 Chennai: Kanchi acharya Jayendra Saraswati 

 faced further humiliation when he was refused entry into 

 the sanctum sanctorum of the Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameshwaram 

 by two priests on Thursday, reports our special correspondent.

 Centuries-old tradition confers the privilege 

 of performing the abishegam (sacred bathing) of the 

 Shiva linga in the sanctum on only three persons: 

 the Kanchi acharya, Sringeri Mutt acharya and the king of 

 Nepal.

 The chairman of the temple board and former king of Ramanathapuram state, who was with the seer, tried to convince the two priests and a temple official that the acharya should be let in. 

 But they said the order to keep the pontiff out had come from the state Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments commissioner in Chennai.

 Cops Godhra claim rejected

 Ahmedabad: The Gujarat government has 

 dismissed additional director-general of police R.B. Sreekumars 

 allegation that he was superseded for speaking out 

 against the handling of the post-Godhra riots as false 

 and baseless, reports our correspondent.

 The 1971 batch IPS officer, who had challenged the governments decision, had named chief minister Narendra Modi as one of the respondents.

 The governments counsel, B.N. Doctor, said Sreekumar was not promoted because he was not eligible. The rules are you cannot be promoted if there is a criminal case pending against you, he said.

 Circus case

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): The CID has 

 submitted its final report on the Apollo Circus sex abuse 

 case to the judicial magistrate with insufficient evidence 

 after the two purported victims said the accused were their 

 husbands. 

 In 2003, police rescued 43 Nepalese women from the circus and medical examination of the two had confirmed sexual assault.

 Indian held 

 Dubai (PTI): An Indian video shop-owner 

 in Bahrain has been jailed for three months on charges of 

 selling and renting out pornographic films. The 26-year-old 

 salesman will be deported after his completing term. 

 Drug peddler 

 Ratlam (PTI): A Madhya Pradesh court 

 has sentenced a man to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for 

 trying to smuggle nearly 40 quintals of opium powder in 

 1999. Rampal, a resident of Rajasthan, has also been fined 

 Rs 1 lakh. 

 The 76-km-long, Rs 150-crore Mughal Road, which will be an alternative to the Jammu and Kashmir National Highway, is expected to be completed by March 2007.

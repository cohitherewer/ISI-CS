 Modi faces state chief hurdle

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, April 1: Narendra Modi is staying on as Gujarat chief minister, but his troubles are far from over.

 The party high command will name the new state BJP chief after the national executive meeting in Delhi on April 6. 

 If the chief minister can push his nominee ? either Dilip Sanghani or Purushaottam Rupala ? for the post, he will have an upper hand in dealing with the coordination committee to be set up to monitor the interaction between the government and the party. 

 The panel is to be headed by former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, who is Modi?s arch rival.

 However, if a Keshubhai loyalist such as Gordhan Zadaphia or Vallabh Kathiria is chosen, the chief minister will find it difficult to coordinate with the state party president. He dislikes any other power centre in the state. 

 This is one reason for the BJP not nominating a state chief though Rajendrasinh Rana?s tenure had ended more than two years ago.

 After the dissident leader?s meeting with L.K. Advani yesterday, Modi has survived his opponents? attempt to oust him. But he is not a winner as the battle is not over yet.

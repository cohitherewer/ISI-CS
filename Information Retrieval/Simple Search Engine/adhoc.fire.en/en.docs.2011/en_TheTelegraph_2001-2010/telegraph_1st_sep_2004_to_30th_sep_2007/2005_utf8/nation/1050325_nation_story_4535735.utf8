 New Delhi, March 24: Pervez Musharraf had appealed to Sonia Gandhi last November to take ?a lead? in improving bilateral relations.

 Next month, Sonia will share the pole position with the Prime Minister in a pathbreaking India-Pakistan initiative, flagging off the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service.

 The Congress chief will also address a public rally along with Manmohan Singh and chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in Srinagar on April 7 before formally flagging off the maiden bus service across the Line of Control.

 The rally is being organised to celebrate the ?happy occasion? of the start of people-to-people contact between the two Kashmirs. ?It is going to be a very happy occasion for the people of Jammu and Kashmir,? said Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma.

 The Prime Minister was scheduled to signal the launch. But as Sonia, too, would be present on the occasion, Sharma said, the two, along with the chief minister, could jointly raise the green flag. 

 The high-profile event comes just over a month before the UPA government completes its first year in office. The decision on roping in Sonia for the bus launch is understood to have been taken at a meeting between Singh and senior Congress leaders yesterday.

 A day before they head for Srinagar, the top leaders would be making a joint appearance in Gujarat to mark the conclusion of the Dandi March replay. Sonia and Singh would march together on the last lap. They will also address a public meeting there.

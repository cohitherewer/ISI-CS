 Voices in defence of shariat courts

 Jilani

 New Delhi/Lucknow, Aug. 16: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board is likely to meet soon to discuss the Supreme Court notices on a petition seeking dissolution of all Islamic and shariat courts in India.

 Senior board member Zafaryab Jilani said the Shariat law was used in accordance with the Shariat Application Act, 1937.

 He said Muslims were governed in matters of marriage, divorce, inheritance, guardianship, the right to will away property, title suits etc by this act but made it clear that a verdict delivered by the qazi of a court was not final or binding.

 The act does not say the verdict cannot be challenged in a civil or a higher court.

 The Lucknow-based Jilani said almost 99 per cent of judgments delivered by the oldest shariat courts in Bihar and Orissa were upheld by civil or higher courts when challenged.

 But he was less forthcoming on criminal cases and the prevalence of a parallel criminal law according to the Shariat. On the Imrana rape, he said: The Imrana judgment was not directed by an Islamic court but pronounced by the mufti of Deoband in the light of the Hanafi sect of Islam. It is an exposition of law.

 Board vice-president Kalbe Sadiq said by looking into complaints and dispensing justice, shariat courts and seminaries were actually helping out the judiciary.

 Millions of cases are pending in various courts. The number would increase tenfold if cases were not adjudicated by organisations like the Dar-ul-Uloom and dar-ul-qazas.

 The political establishment was more circumspect in its response. An aide of Mulayam Singh Yadav said the Uttar Pradesh chief minister was very aware of the court notice but would react only after a detailed discussion with urban development minister Azam Khan.

 The state principal secretary, home, Aloke Sinha, said the government was gathering information on the so-called parallel Muslim judicial system and would furnish a proper reply to the notice.

 We are in the proper of compiling reports, he said.

 CPI leader A.B. Bardhan said: It is a matter which affects an entire community. It should be looked at much more seriously.

 Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Salman Khursheed said: The court has just issued a notice and it does not constitute a verdict. But if it generates debate and discussion, it is good. Let a view emerge from this.

 He said the concept of a religious court was hazy. We do not know if there is a formal court and if it can exercise authority on issues of religious nature. But if people approach such bodies and accept their verdicts, what can be done? he asked.

 The BJP was more upfront. Spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: The Muslim Personal Law Board behaves like an extra-constitutional authority. It can advise on religious matters but on issues impinging on civil and criminal laws, it should not interfere. I support the immediate dissolution of Islamic and shariat courts.

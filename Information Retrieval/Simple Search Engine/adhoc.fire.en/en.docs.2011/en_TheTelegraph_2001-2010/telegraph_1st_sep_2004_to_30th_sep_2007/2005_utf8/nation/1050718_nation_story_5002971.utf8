 Gaur serves diktat for lunch

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, July 17: Get tiffin to office, dont waste valuable time and fuel going home for lunch and getting back.

 Thats Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaurs latest diktat to government employees, some 5,50,000 of them.

 The order ? Gaurs effort to discipline the bureaucracy is well known by now ? comes close on the heels of others such as making singing the Vande Mataram mandatory to attempts to enforce a dress code and flash names and designations.

 Gaur said he had information that many employees were stealing a siesta after lunch and using official cars to go back and forth. All this was needless waste of time and fuel, he said.

 Sarita Rani, an employee in the state education department, said order or no, the practice was still continuing. Now instead of the saheb, the car goes to fetch the lunch box, she claimed.

 Expectedly, employees reacted angrily. It is none of the governments business if someone is eating in office or at home as long as the employee returns during the stipulated time, fumed Ramesh Chandra, Madhya Pradesh Government Employees Union co-ordinator.

 He said the state secretariat at Vallabh Bhawan had electric gadgets to monitor arrival and exit times. So whats the fuss all about? he asked.

 The diktat did not spark much enthusiasm in Gaurs party either. At a state BJP brainstorming in the hill resort of Panchmarhi, 80 officials complained that nobody ? from collector to patwari ? bothered about the ruling party.

 They alleged that bureaucrats were a law unto themselves and did not listen to elected representatives of the Assembly, panchayat and the municipal corporation.

 The Congress, too, made light of Gaurs efforts. Leader of the Opposition Jamuna Devi said Gaurs lunch order proved that the rationale behind enforcing Vande Mataram had not served its purpose.

 Gaur had made singing Vande Mataram mandatory from July 1, hoping it would inculcate a sense of patriotism and ensure punctuality.

 Naidu: Close shave

Patna, Jan. 29: Former BJP president M. Venkaiah 

Naidu had a close shave this afternoon when his helicopter made an emergency landing 

in Gaya district before extremists set it ablaze.

 The incident took place around 3 pm in a field in Pararia village in the Barachatti area. Naidu, who is campaigning across the state for the Assembly elections, was on his way to Hazaribagh via Bodh Gaya when the helicopter ran out of fuel.

 As soon as it landed in the Naxalite-infested area, the BJP leader contacted party general secretary Arun Jaitley who, too, was in Gaya.

 Jaitley informed the district administration and sought security arrangements for Naidu, party sources said.

 But no one reached the site for over an hour, after which Naidu and his aides set out for Barachatti police station by road. ?Within half an hour, the extremists surrounded the field and attacked the helicopter,? a local source said.

 The rebels, suspected to be Maoists, threw petrol bombs at the abandoned chopper, damaging it partially.

 The BJP leader later went to Hazaribagh where he will continue his campaign.

 The CPI (Maoist) ? the unified Naxalite outfit comprising the Maoist Communist Centre and the People?s War ? has given a call for boycotting the polls and has threatened to disrupt them. The rebels have already killed two candidates and attacked some others. 

 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad condemned the incident and said it reflected the failure of the government. ?The administration knew that the area was infested with Naxalites and a VIP was travelling on the route. Yet, the local administration failed to make foolproof security arrangement for him.?

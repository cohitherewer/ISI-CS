 PF board shuts market door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 31: The Left has won the second round in the tussle over the employees? provident fund. The first time, the Prime Minister had yielded to its demand to restore the fund?s 9.5 per cent interest rate. 

 Union labour minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao today said the central board of trustees has decided against investing in the share market or mutual funds.

 ?We do not want to take risks. We want to safeguard workers? interests,? he said, giving in to the demand of the Left parties not to park the social security money in the erratic stock market.

 The finance ministry, which wants the board to invest in stocks for high returns, may not like the decision but it has made trade unions happy.

 The decision of the central board of provident fund came a little over a month after the trustees of the Rs 1,30,000-crore corpus, which has 40 million subscribers, appointed the international consultant Mercer Human Resources to recommend measures to improve returns on the fund?s investments.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s announcement of a 9.5 per cent interest rate has landed the board in a spot. It faces an annual deficit of Rs 927 crore ? the sum that represents the gap between the return on its investments and what it would have to pay subscribers.

 ?We still do not know where the money will come from. But the Prime Minister has made a commitment and it will have to be honoured,? an official in the labour ministry said. 

 The labour ministry has not yet issued a notification announcing the restoration of the 9.5 per cent interest rate. Officials said the rate could at best be sustained for a year. The board of trustees will meet next month to discuss new investment options.

 The fund in the past invested 80 per cent of its money in the government?s special deposit scheme (SDS). But over the years the interest rate on the SDS came down from 12 to 8 per cent, forcing the government to slash the provident fund interest rate from 9.5 to 8 per cent in 2002. The fund does not invest any money in the SDS at present because of the low returns.

 W.R. Wardharajan, a leader of the Citu, the CPM?s trade union wing, said: ?The government will not be able to find enough resources to meet its commitment of a 9.5 per cent interest rate unless it increased the interest rate on government-sponsored small saving schemes like general provident fund and public provident fund.?

 This means the government would have to increase subsidies at a time when the general trend is to squeeze out subsidies in every sector. It is unlikely that the finance ministry will agree to reverse the trend.

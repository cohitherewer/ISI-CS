 Taste of India to tickle Pakistani fans

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, April 16: Chaats, jalebis, halwa 

and parathas ? if you can?t beat them on the field, win outside.

 With warmth, that is.

 But not by food alone. Along with the chaats of Chandni Chowk will be bhangra at Dilli Haat. After all, music ? as the bard said ? is the food of love.

 A taste of India awaits Pakistani fans as they touch down in the capital for the final face-off between the cricket rivals. If Pervez Musharraf is the honoured guest at the Ferozeshah Kotla tomorrow, the city wants to give the President?s compatriots memories to take back home ? a sight of the Qutb Minar, Red Fort, Humayun?s tomb and the Lotus temple.

 Starting on a sober note on Sunday, the last day of Navratra, the Delhi cricket association is planning to serve vegetarian fare from Hotel Intercontinental to the 2,000 Pakistani fans expected to be at the stadium. 

 A big treat also awaits them at Chandni Chowk where its former MP Vijay Goel has organised a cultural programme to showcase the Ganga-Jamni tehzeeb of the Old City to symbolise communal harmony. 

 Strains of qawali, a performance of traditional dances and a display of fireworks will greet the visitors in the heart of Chandni Chowk near the historic Town Hall, just a few metres from the stadium. The programme is being organised by Lok Abhiyan Sanstha, a local non-government organisation. Volunteers from the NGO will be at hand to give the fans a guided tour of Old Delhis ancient havelis, temples, mosques, gurdwaras and churches.

 Goel, who heads the NGO, said the special programme was his way of returning the warm welcome he got when he went to Pakistan for the Revival Series last year. ?Our Pakistani friends will get a firsthand experience of Old Delhi through various cultural programmes organised by us on Sunday evening,? the former Union minister said, adding that he would like to present a copy of his book The Emperor City ? Chandni Chowk to the visiting President. 

 A Baisakhi festival, which is being organised at Dilli Haat that has food courts as well as artisans selling handicraft and handloom items from all the states, is ready with a bhangra music and dance performance for the visitors.

 Suman Sharma, chief manager of the Delhi Transport and Tourism Development Corporation, said the Pakistani fans will be allowed free entry to Dilli Haat while there will be a 25 per cent discount for them on all sightseeing tours organised by the corporation.

 Tourists who are having trouble finding their way around Delhi are being helped by the corporation?s information centres at the airport and at other places.

 ?The trouble is they have not come in an organised way. They are going to have problems in finding places like Chitli Bazar because some of the names have changed. But special buses can be arranged for the visitors if they come in a group,? Sharma said.

 Last-minute ticket seekers hovered outside the stadium under the watchful eyes of security personnel. Those who entered, including the cricket body?s officials and journalists, were frisked.

 Inside, four policemen armed with machine guns guarded the pitch ? the Shiv Sena has threatened to go to any extent, including digging the pitch, to prevent the match from being played.

 Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul inspected the stadium to check security arrangements, especially the bullet-proof box for Musharraf and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

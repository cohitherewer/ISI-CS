 New Delhi, April 29: Having cut a CD of his favourite Elvis Presley songs and crooned along with Hollywood hero Tom Cruise, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was a hit even before he entered Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram, this morning.

 Six-year-olds dressed in little kimonos and waving the Japanese flag greeted his cavalcade and as he stepped out, a tilak and garlands awaited Koizumi.

 When principal Shyama Chona declared that Japan?s most unconventional Prime Minister was a ?maverick?, there was only the sound of ice breaking as Koizumi chuckled aloud. ?I feel much more popular here than in Japan,? he said.

 DPS has a three-decade history of teaching its students Japanese and running a student exchange programme with the east Asian country. One of the few schools that teach the language from Class VI, DPS R.K. Puram now plans to introduce it in Classes X and XII. 

 Welcoming Koizumi, the principal said: ?You are a popular leader in Japan. And today, you have become a popular leader of the children of India.? In November 1992, Prince and Princess Akishino had visited the school.

 Accompanied by Japanese ambassador Yasukuni Enoki who chose the school for the visit, Koizumi looked surprised when the students welcomed him in Japanese and reciprocated with a namaskar. As they burst into a Japanese song about joining hands and living together, the guest hummed along.

 Unlike Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao who spoke in Chinese at IIT Delhi a fortnight ago, Koizumi opted for English. ?I am surprised that you are very good at speaking Japanese, very proud that you are learning Japanese very well. Also, I am very proud to hear that many people are eager to learn Japanese,? he said. 

 The children put up a dance performance, which was a fusion of Bharatnatyam and Japanese styles, and brought gifts ? a handmade bouquet, portraits of Indian leaders, a painting and scrolls and cards to be given to Japanese children.

 Koizumi also dropped into a Japanese language class. As the students sang If you are happy, clap your hands, in Japanese, Koizumi joined in clapping and stamping his foot. 

 ?I like him. He is kind and he is gentle,? said Shruti Sinha, a Class-VI student.

 Nitish sticks to NDA path

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 11: In a fresh twist to the Bihar drama, Nitish Kumar today said it was not possible to form a government in the state without the BJP. 

 His announcement came on the day rival Ram Vilas Paswan met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to assure her of his support to the UPA.

 On Saturday, Nitish had said his party, the Janata Dal (United), was calling off all efforts on government formation because of Paswan?s ?intransigence?. 

 But, today he said: ?We are part of the NDA. Many parties are there. We have contested the elections jointly and now how can we adopt different paths??

 But he put a rider. ?Paswan has put many conditions, all of which will be acceptable to me. I am putting only one condition before him ? a merger of his LJP with the JD (U).? 

 Paswan gave Nitish a cold shoulder when he tried to cobble together a non-BJP, non-RJD government. The CPI and the CPM also rejected Kumar?s offers, while the Nationalist Congress Party, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party did not respond to his letter seeking support.

 So, ?now, whatever attempts will be made, the BJP will be part of the exercise?, Nitish concluded.

 Dal (U) sources said the assessment in their camp is that Paswan would never leave the UPA or relinquish his cabinet post. By asking him to merge his party with the Dal (U), Nitish was trying to expose him before the people, the sources added. 

 ?Nitish knows that Paswan would never merge his party with the JD(U) as he never digested Nitish?s hold on Bihar politics. Both are ambitious politicians fighting a turf war. So, a merger would be the last thing in Paswan?s mind,? said an LJP leader. 

 At the conclusion of a two-day national executive of the Dal (U) today, Kumar said there was a thinking in the party that it should quit the NDA, but after sensing that some non-RJD parties were not interested in backing him, the party has now decided to stick to the BJP. 

 He rubbished the claim that the Dal (U) was poaching on Paswan?s flock. ?None of the JD (U) leaders can afford to stay in a hotel in Patna. Despite having a house there, he (Paswan) chooses to stay in a posh hotel. So, it is there for everyone to see who can poach and who cannot.?

 Disabled women in distress

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 17: Domestic violence is a reality that a large section of disabled women in the state has to cope with.

 A city-based organisation, Swabhiman, yesterday released the findings of an Oxfam-funded survey, ?A study on domestic violence against disabled women in Orissa?, which revealed that 67 per cent of physically-challenged and 46 per cent of mentally-challenged women in the state were victims of domestic violence.

 The survey was conducted last year in Puri, Cuttack, Jajpur, Khurda, Sundargarh Jagatsinghpur, Bolangir, Nuapara, Navrangpur, Koraput, Malkangiri and Mayurbhanj.

 About 50 per cent of the 729 women interviewed ? 595 physically challenged and 134 mentally-challenged ? had been assaulted by their husbands. Parents, husbands and close family members were the usual perpetrators of emotional or physical abuse for both groups. 

 Some hearing-impaired and mentally-challenged women have also been sexually abused by family members and close friends, the study showed.

 ?While people with disabilities are at the end of the priority list in our society, their parents are the most apathetic lot,? said Shruti Mohapatra, secretary-general of Swabhiman. 

 She was in charge of the survey along with Mihir Mohanty, associate investigator of the project. 

 Not surprisingly, only 30 per cent of the respondents were married, indicating lack of interest on the part of parents to get their disabled daughters married off. 

 The possibility of being considered asexual and therefore deprived of their right to raise a family, childbirth, adoption and housekeeping is directly proportional to how evident the disability is, the study showed.

 Around 44 per cent of the respondents reported being kicked during pregnancy while husbands of 12 per cent threatened them by pouring kerosene. 

 Thirty per cent of the victims of physical abuse required medical attention while 22 per cent of the women said they have been assaulted at home.

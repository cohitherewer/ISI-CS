 Fruit, faith and a ride

 Ghatagaon (Keonjhar), Jan. 30: In Orissa and want a free and safe ride? Get yourself a coconut.

 Wave the fruit wrapped in a piece of red cloth anywhere in the state and it is certain that bus drivers will stop to pick up the shelled fruit, if not the person holding it. The destination: Maa Tarini Thakurani Temple in Ghatagaon village of Keonjhar, which draws thousands of devotees from all parts of the state every day.

 In case a bus is not headed for Ghatagaon, the coconuts will change hands like batons in a relay race before reaching the temple. 

 ?I have never been to Ghatagaon. But I am sure my offering will reach the goddess safely,? says an ageing Raghunath Swain of Nirakarpur in Cuttack while handing over a coconut wrapped in a red cloth to a driver at Baramunda bus stand in Bhubaneswar. 

 Bus drivers in the state may be abusive to passengers like Swain, but they dare not refuse the coconuts for reasons of faith. 

 ?It will be sacrilege if we refuse the fruits. After all, Maa Tarini keeps us safe on the roads,? says Gadadhar Bhoi, a driver who operates between Bhubaneswar and Jajpur. 

 With road accidents on the rise, drivers seek divine intervention to keep the highways safe. Not surprisingly, the driver?s cabin in Bhoi?s bus is stacked with coconuts donated by devotees here. 

 ?It?s pure faith that drives the service,? says G.C. Singh, secretary of the temple trust. 

 Though the road leading to the temple is in horrible shape, thousands of devotees come to the temple everyday to offer coconuts and prayers. 

 The devotees have played a significant role in expanding the network of the courier service, setting up hundreds of coconut collection centres in Cuttack, Bhadrak, Bhubaneswar and even Jajpur. The system works like a well-oiled machine. 

 At the temple, tribal priests take turns to break the coconuts in front of the deity. Though about 10,000 coconuts arrive at the temple everyday ? 6,000 by bus and the rest with devotees ? there is space for only a few hundred near the deity?s feet.The temple authorities sell the unused coconuts at Rs 2-3 each to local shopkeepers and make a profit of Rs 30 lakh annually. 

 This has spawned a local industry as shopkeepers use the coconuts to make sweetmeats and oil and sell them to devotees. The profit from the coconuts has helped the temple managing committee build a VIP guesthouse and a restroom for visitors. A market complex too has come up near the temple.

 Certificate relief for J amp;K women

 Jammu (PTI): The state government has 

 withdrawn its controversial order restricting the period 

 of validity of permanent resident certificates of unmarried 

 women till their marriage. 

 The withdrawal of the January 2005 circular was communicated to Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Monday by additional advocate-general A.H. Qazi in connection with a public interest litigation and contempt petition filed by professor Hari Om. 

 The court observed that Qazi had placed on record the copy of a circular dated August 2, 2005, whereby the government withdrew its earlier orders stating that the permanent resident certificates for unmarried women would be re-issued after marriage. 

 Hari Om challenged the circular saying that it was in violation of a three-year-old high court ruling.

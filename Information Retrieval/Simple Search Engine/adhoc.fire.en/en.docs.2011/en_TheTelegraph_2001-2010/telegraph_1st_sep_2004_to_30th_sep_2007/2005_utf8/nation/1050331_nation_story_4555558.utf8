 Small neighbours in focus

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Port Louis (Mauritius), March 30: Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his party flaunted the ?maturing? of Indo-US relations as a high-point in the six-year life of the National Democratic Alliance government.

 Vajpayee?s successor, Manmohan Singh, has chosen Mauritius as the destination for his first bilateral visit and it did not happen by chance, claimed sources close to the Prime Minister.

 Foreign policy is not Singh?s first area of interest or concern but his choice is influenced by his view that India needs to focus on countries that are specks on the world map but count in their own ways.

 In the process, the sources said, the Prime Minister is ?redefining? the concept of India?s neighbours. ?Who is a neighbour? In a village, the nearest house can be 10 miles away but the occupant is a neighbour nonetheless. As the crow flies over the Indian Ocean, Mauritius is India?s nearest neighbour,? quipped a source.

 In his departure statement, Singh said he saw Mauritius as a ?friendly gateway to the African continent and an invaluable partner at multilateral fora?.

 Singh?s original bilateral trip would have included Sri Lanka as well, reinforcing his notion of global diplomacy.

 But after the Pakistan President expressed a desire to watch an India-Pakistan one-dayer in Delhi, Singh had to drop Lanka from his itinerary from where he was to reach Kochi in Kerala to meet Pervez Musharraf, according to the original schedule. By then, reworking his travel plans was ?not possible?, a source said.

 Singh?s second bilateral visit would probably be to Singapore next month. He will go to Afghanistan in October to inaugurate the Parliament complex built with Indian help.

 The Prime Minister, sources said, is still undecided about a US visit despite an invitation. It is believed he would rather wait for Washington to first clarify its offer of civil and nuclear technology cooperation.

 In Mauritius, Singh will call on President Anerood Jugnauth and leader of the Opposition Navinchandra Ramgoolam. He will also address the national Assembly.

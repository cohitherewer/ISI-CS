The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Scapegoat in Sonias hand, cries George

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Alleging that Natwar Singh has been made a scapegoat in the oil-for-food scam, George Fernandes today launched a vicious attack on Sonia Gandhi, saying the former external affairs minister worked at the UPA chairpersons behest.

 The NDA convener demanded a probe into the Congresss involvement in the scam and said Sonia should relinquish all posts paid for by the exchequer in the wake of the scandal.

 With party colleague Digvijay Singh by his side, Fernandes said: The nation demands a full disclosure of the exact nature of promises made by the Congress to the then Iraq government in return for favours. What were the contents of the letter that our now minister without portfolio (Natwar) carried on behalf of Sonia Gandhi to Saddam Hussein? How much money has been made in the transaction and where has it gone? 

 Natwar Singh should not be made a scapegoat as the Congress, too, has been mentioned in the Volcker report. If Natwar Singh deserved to be deprived of his portfolio, surely Sonia Gandhi cannot hold on to her responsibilities currently supported by the public exchequer. 

 The former defence minister alleged that the government was trying to hide the truth and manipulate procedures so that the Congress president could escape scrutiny. 

 A commission of inquiry headed by Justice R.S. Pathak has been appointed in a blatant attempt to mislead the nation. From the terms of reference, it is clear that the commission has not been empowered to inquire into the role of both the Congress and Natwar Singh. 

 When told that the terms of reference for the judicial commission had not been spelt out yet, Fernandes said: We have learnt it from somewhere. 

 On being pressed further, Digvijay, a former minister of state for foreign affairs, said science and technology minister Kapil Sibal has disclosed it in a television interview. 

 We heard him saying it. He is not only a minister but an eminent lawyer as well. We take his word for it, Digvijay said.

 Hinting that the NDA would raise the scam forcefully during the coming Parliament session, Fernandes said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should set matters right. 

 We demand that he does so in accordance with his principles and status or resign with his cabinet before the people bring this government down, the NDA convener said.

 Electronic junk poisons air, soil

 - Study raises alarm on waste recycling

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: Imported and domestic electronic junk recycled in India is contaminating the nations air and soil with toxic organic compounds and metals, Greenpeace International has claimed.

 Investigators of the environmental group said air and street dust as well as soil sediments around electronic waste recycling units in China and India contain levels of organic contaminants and metals higher than normal.

 Their findings are based on a study of 70 dust and soil samples analysed earlier this year at the Greenpeace Research Laboratories in the University of Exeter, UK. While activists have long warned that India has emerged as a graveyard for electronic waste, the new study analysed environmental contamination in and around recycling units in Chinas southern Guang Dong province and in parts of Delhi.

 This study has shown that contamination has moved beyond the recycling units, said Ramapati Kumar, a campaigner with Greenpeace. The levels of some contaminants were higher than normal 200 metres away from recycling units.

 Greenpeace said the study is not exhaustive, but illustrates the concerns that emerge from a largely unregulated recycling industry.

 Levels of some toxic substances were 20 times higher than the background around the workshops in India and 50 times higher around sites in China, Kumar said. The larger volume of recycling in China accounts for the higher values there, he added.

 Dust from one Delhi workshop showed cadmium concentration 40,000 times higher than normal, the Greenpeace report claimed. The level of nickel in dust at this workshop was 500 times higher than normal.

 The investigators also detected unusually high levels of copper, cadmium, mercury, lead and tin and organic contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyl in several samples from recycling workshops in both countries.

 Greenpeace said the findings highlight the need to reformulate all new electronic goods to facilitate proper dismantling and component separation and to avoid the use of hazardous chemical components at the source. Germany, Switzerland and Taiwan are among countries that have passed laws that make it mandatory for manufacturers to take back domestic electrical and electronic goods at the end of their life span.

 India and other Asian countries lack such legislation. Last year, an environment group called Toxics Link had estimated on the basis of an informal sample survey that about 20,000 kg of electronic waste was entering India every day.

 Computers, cathode ray tubes, discarded mobile phones and electrical items make up most of the electronic junk that enters India, activists have said. Recycling such junk for metals is cheaper in India than it is in the US or Europe. Discarded domestic hardware and electrical goods also add to the volumes.

 Left smells fuel for fire in gas pipeline

 New Delhi, July 22: The Prime Ministers remark in the US about the many risks associated with the proposed Indo-Iranian gas pipeline could set off another controversy with the Left.

 Only preliminary discussions have taken place (on the pipeline), Manmohan Singh had told The Washington Post on Wednesday.

 But I am realistic enough to realise that there are many risks because, considering all the uncertainties of the situation there in Iran, I dont know if any international consortium of bankers would probably underwrite this. But? we desperately need the supply of gas that Iran has.

 The Left parties have read in the remarks an indication that the pipeline could be put on hold. They today stressed that going ahead with the project will be seen as an acid test for the Centres commitment to an independent policy serving (the) national interest.

 In the past few months, Washington has dropped enough hints that it is opposed to the pipeline coming up. The Left parties want an explanation from Singh whether his remarks were made under American pressure.

 It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister has made such remarks in Washington when it is well known that the US is opposed to the project, the CPM, CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc said in a joint statement after a meeting this afternoon.

 The Prime Minister should immediately clarify whether the commitment to the pipeline project has been diluted (during his) visit to the United States.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, however, said negotiations with Pakistan were on to ensure the pipeline would be safe from all risks.

 The project entails taking the required measures to mitigate (the) risks involved, Aiyar said here. Negotiations are on schedule. We are working towards that.

 Singh is scheduled to make a statement in Parliament on his US visit and the agreement he has signed with Washington on cooperation on civilian nuclear energy. He may take the opportunity to clarify his remarks on the gas pipeline. The Left is likely to wait till then before saying anything more on the subject.

 The Left had yesterday accused the Centre of a pro-US shift as reflected in the joint statement signed by Singh and President Bush on a strategic Indo-US partnership. The CPM and the CPI feared the Centre was compromising the national interest by conceding too much to Washington.

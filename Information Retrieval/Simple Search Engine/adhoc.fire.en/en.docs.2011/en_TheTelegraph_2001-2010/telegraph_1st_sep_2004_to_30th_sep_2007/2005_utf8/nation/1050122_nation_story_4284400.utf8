 Congress targets hung House

 - With Paswan on its side, party mounts bid to keep Laloo in check

 KAY BENEDICT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: With the Congress? aspirations in Bihar running into a wall called Laloo Prasad Yadav, Sonia Gandhi?s party has been working quietly with Ram Vilas Paswan, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief?s rival. 

 Two days ago, much to Laloo Prasad?s chagrin, the Congress and the Lok Janshakti Party reached an understanding on seats for the first phase of polls involving 64 constituencies. 

 Curious though it may sound, the Congress and the LJP are working in tandem for a hung House. They know none of them can form a government alone in Bihar, where the RJD still has the upper hand. 

 ?The only way to keep Laloo Prasad in check is to have a hung House so that the RJD is heavily dependent on the Congress and LJP for support,? said a source. 

 Reining in Laloo Prasad seems to be as much on the minds of Congress strategists as an old score they have to settle. On the eve of last year?s Lok Sabha polls, they had sent a chopper to Madhya Pradesh to fetch Paswan to Delhi for talks. They hoped to be able to pull the rug under the feet of Laloo Prasad, who was being stingy about seats, as he tried to be this time as well.

 With Laloo Prasad driving a hard bargain, the Congress quietly tried to forge a Dalit-upper caste alliance, numerically superior to the RJD?s Muslim-Yadav combination. 

 But that was the heyday of the Laloo-Paswan honeymoon, and after his talks with Congress leaders, the LJP chief called him in Patna and apprised him of the offer. Laloo Prasad summoned Paswan and hastily sealed a seat deal. 

 Paswan was offered eight seats and the Congress just four, leaving the party shocked. 

 That was some 10 months ago. Now, Laloo Prasad has fallen out with Paswan and the Congress is paying back. 

 The new friends are hoping the Congress can bring upper caste and Muslim votes while Paswan commands about 7-8 per cent of the Dalit votes.

 Though Laloo Prasad?s personal equation with Sonia seems to have remained intact, sources feel the Congress is trying to tame the RJD chief. The party believes Laloo Prasad needs the Congress more than the Congress needs him. 

 The Congress had bailed him out when the NDA was plotting to impose President?s rule on Bihar. Moreover, the RJD chief and four of his ministerial colleagues are facing various charges and they need Congress backing. Though the Manmohan Singh government would be vulnerable minus the support of the 25-member RJD, Laloo Prasad?s political compulsions do not give him the option of backing out. 

 Talks are on between Paswan and the Congress to extend the seat-sharing deal to the second and third phases.

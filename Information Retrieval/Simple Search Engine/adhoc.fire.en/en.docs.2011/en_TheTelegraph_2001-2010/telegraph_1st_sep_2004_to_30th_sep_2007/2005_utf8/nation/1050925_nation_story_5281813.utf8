 Brake on easy bail

 Court Scan 

 Before 

 granting bail the court must consider:

 How bad the alleged offence is

 If there is reason to believe accused might tamper 

 with witnesses or pose a threat to 

 complainant

 How strong, prima facie, the evidence against 

 the accused is

New Delhi, Sept. 24: Getting bail in criminal cases will no longer be a matter of routine. The Supreme Court has asked lower courts to exercise discretion while hearing bail applications.

 If a court grants bail, it should also give (its) reasons, particularly where the accused is charged with a serious offence, a division bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and Arun Kumar said. Any non-reasoned order (granting bail) is clearly indefensible.

 A court dealing with the bail application should be satisfied? whether there is a prima facie case, the September 19 judgment said, citing several points that must be considered before bail is granted (see box).

 The Supreme Court order applies to applications for statutory bail in cases of non-bailable offences. In such cases, the accused is taken into custody and produced before a magistrate.

 He then usually gets remanded in police or judicial custody, the remand being continually renewed till, after 60 days, the deadline for police to file the chargesheet arrives.

 After this, the accused becomes eligible for statutory bail and can file an application for one. 

 In cases of bailable offences, the accused is served a warrant, appears before a magistrate and secures bail by depositing an amount. These offences are relatively lighter, and bail is given as a matter of routine.

 Its the trend of routinely granting statutory bail for the more serious non-bailable offences that has brought the Supreme Court stricture.

 The apex court cancelled the bail granted by Allahabad High Court to a certain Sher Mohammad, accused of shooting a man dead with a double-barrelled gun following a property dispute. Justices Passayat and Kumar mentioned that Mohammad had earlier, too, been accused in several criminal cases and faced proceedings under the Goonda Act.

 The Supreme Court upheld the trial court order that had denied bail to Mohammad and set aside the high courts grant of relief.

 The trial court had elaborately analysed the factual position and had rejected the prayer for bail, the bench said. The grant of bail to the respondent by a non-speaking and non-reasoned order was not proper.

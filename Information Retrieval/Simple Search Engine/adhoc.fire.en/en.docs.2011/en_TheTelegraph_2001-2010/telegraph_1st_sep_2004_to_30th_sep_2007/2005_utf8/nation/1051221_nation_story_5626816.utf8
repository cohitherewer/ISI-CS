 Tyreburst at LA, but safe

 Los Angeles, Dec. 20 (PTI): A New Delhi-bound Air-India flight today made a safe emergency landing at Los Angeles international airport, about 90 minutes after blowing a tyre during take-off. All 267 people on board escaped unhurt.

 A woman was, however, taken to hospital after fainting, an official said. A media report suggested that she might have suffered a mild heart attack. 

 Some passengers were also treated for anxiety. There were emotional injuries and stress, city fire department spokesman Jim Wells was quoted as saying.

 The Air-India flight 136, which was to fly via Frankfurt, took off from the airport at 8.33 pm (10.03 am IST today) but blew at least one of its tyres, airport spokeswoman Nancy Castles said.

 The Boeing 747 then dumped fuel over the ocean before returning to the airport at 10 pm (11.30 am IST), emanating sparks as it touched down. 

 About 150 firefighters and paramedics responded at touchdown, spraying foam to douse the flames emanating from its wheels as the plane came to a halt.

 A spokesman for the airline said in Mumbai that a probe had been ordered and the engineers were attending to the aircraft. Depending on the serviceability of the jet, it would take off again. Otherwise passengers would be accommodated by another airline.

 State in dark, CM goes to Hollywood

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 19: His state is groping in the dark with 12-hour blackouts and a power shortage of 3,500 mw but Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is out on a 16-day US tour to chase foreign investment and take a short Hollywood hop. 

 The worlds most famous film industry will be a two-day halt for Deshmukh, who left for the US yesterday with a 27-member entourage. It includes state industries minister Ashok Chavan, 16 CII representatives and 10 top officials of various departments. 

 The chief ministers tour has come in for criticism in political circles. Without adequate power, which American industrial house would be so foolish to invest in Maharashtra that faces 12-hour load sheddings? the leader of Opposition, Nitin Gadkari, asked. It is not practical to undertake a tour for investment at this juncture. If it is a pleasure trip, why do it in the name of investment? This is like Nero playing the fiddle while Rome was burning.

 The chief ministers tour begins with Bio 2005, an international conference on biotechnology in Pennsylvania today. 

 Deshmukh will make a presentation on biotech advances in Maharashtra. He will travel to New York next, where the stock exchange will be one of his halts. He will also meet Indo-US business representatives and attend a trade meet, jointly organised by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce and the Indian embassy. 

 On Wednesday, Deshmukh is scheduled to meet the IBM top brass to explore how the information technology major could increase investments in his state. 

 The next stop will be San Francisco where the chief minister will take a look at the Napa Valley wineries to explore the scope of investment in the sector.

 Deshmukh will also go to Los Angeles for his two-day Hollywood halt and a meeting with Indian diamond traders. Deshmukh, whose younger son Riteish is an actor, will stop at Universal Studios, ostensibly to explore potential tie-ups with Bollywood.

 On June 28, Deshmukh will hit Seattle for talks with top officials of Boeing and Microsoft. He will also go to Atlanta to meet representatives of Delta Airways and other American corporations.

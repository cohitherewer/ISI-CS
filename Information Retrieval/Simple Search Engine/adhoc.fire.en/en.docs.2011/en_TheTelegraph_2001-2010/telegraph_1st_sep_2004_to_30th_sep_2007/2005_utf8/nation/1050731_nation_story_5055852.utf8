 Varsity scraps pregnancy clause

 Shimla (PTI): A controversial 

 order of the Himachal Pradesh University asking married 

 women applying for admission to B.Ed to furnish ?not-pregnant? 

 certificates has been dropped after the state women?s commission 

 slapped a notice terming the provision ?inhuman and discriminatory?.

 Taking suo motu notice of news 

 reports saying married women were asked to produce such 

 certificates during counselling for the course, the commission 

 issued the notice demanding clarification on the discriminatory 

 provision.

 Don?t disturb! Honeymoon cell in jail

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Feb. 6: What a Gujarat court had refused to permit has all but got the nod of a conservative Islamist government in Pakistan.

 A prisoner serving a life term in the Northwestern Frontier Province will soon have a room to himself to spend time with his family once every three months. 

 In Gujarat, Firoz Khan?s plea to be let out on bail so that he could be with his wife was turned down.

 The Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal government in the Pakistan province will construct at least five rooms each in four provincial jails to enable long-serving inmates to catch up with their kin. Senior provincial minister Siraj-ul-Haq told The Telegraph: ?We have decided to begin construction in the next few months to enable prisoners serving life terms to live with their wives and children for five days after every three months.?

 The Pakistani experiment is being widely hailed by people and not just rights activists and non-government organisations. Even the Senate (the upper House) functional committee on human rights has greeted it. ?This is a welcome decision, which other provinces must try to follow,? the committee observed in a meeting held in the parliament house on Friday.

 The pro-Taliban Majlis-e-Ammal, which occupies Opposition benches in the federal legislature but is in power in the Northwestern Frontier Province, has been criticised in the past for implementing strict Islamic laws ? banning cable TV and disallowing women models in fashion shows.

 But for the construction of family rooms in the prisons in Haripur, Peshawar, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan, the provincial government has already done the necessary homework. ?Every room will have a separate kitchen and washroom,? Siraj-ul-Haq said, adding that construction work will be completed by the middle of the next financial year.

 ?We hope that philanthropists and well-off people will cooperate with our government in this noble task,? Haq said.

 Rights activists believe there is a need for drastic jail reforms in Pakistan, and hope the decision of the province?s government will prove a step forward.

 ?This is a wise decision from the medical point of view, as allowing the prisoners to spend time with their spouses will also discourage homosexuality and prevent spread of AIDS and other deadly diseases among the inmates,? said Ruquia Haider, a Pakistani doctor practising in the UK.

 Haider said many European cities have such jails, where the prisoners enjoy family reunion for two or three days once in a couple of months. ?This is how we can help prisoners live a happy life behind bars.?

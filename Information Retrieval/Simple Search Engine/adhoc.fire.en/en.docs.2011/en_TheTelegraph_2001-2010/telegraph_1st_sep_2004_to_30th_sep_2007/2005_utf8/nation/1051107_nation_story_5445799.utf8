 Attack probe

 Patna, Nov. 6: BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad today demanded a high-level probe into the gun attack on him during a poll rally at Nokha in Sasaram on October 6, reports our special correspondent.

 The Rajya Sabha member alleged that as part of a larger conspiracy, his attacker, Hulchul Rai, was not given proper treatment and as a consequence, he died at a Patna hospital last month.

 The authorities could have shifted him to All-India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi or some other speciality hospital out of Bihar. But it seems no one was interested, Prasad said at his first news conference after the attack.

 Rai had been beaten up by a mob after he opened fire on Prasad, hitting him in the arm. The attacker then slipped into a coma and died in hospital a few days later.

 The former Union minister claimed that he was sure that the next target of the shooter was his party colleague Pramod Mahajan, who was present on the stage. I was conscious for more than two hours after the attack. I could see the attacker and he was set to target Mahajan after me. 

 Prasad said not a single policeman was present at the venue though a crowd of nearly 12,000 people had assembled there. Steps had also been taken to inform the district administration in advance, he added.

 When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh came to meet me at AIIMS, I urged him to ensure better security for politicians campaigning in Bihar. I now appeal to him to order a high-level probe into the incident so that the truth comes out, Prasad said.

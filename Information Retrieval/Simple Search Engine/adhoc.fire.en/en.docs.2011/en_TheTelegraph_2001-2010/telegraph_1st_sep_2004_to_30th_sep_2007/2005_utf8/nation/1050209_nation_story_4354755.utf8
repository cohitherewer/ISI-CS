 Congress backs Vyas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: Girija Vyas, chairperson of the Congress? media department, seems all set to head the National Council for Women. 

 She will succeed Poornima Advani who was appointed in the former NDA regime.

 The human resource development wing recommended Vyas?s name and the PMO, according to sources, has cleared it. A formal announcement is yet to arrive. 

 Noted actor and former Rajya Sabha MP Shabana Azmi and social activist Nafisa Ali were the two other names on the panel of recommendations. Vyas, who is a political lightweight at present, was not faring too well in the Congress? media department. She, however, seems keen on the council chairpersonship. 

 The commission, like others of its kind, investigates cases of harassment, discrimination and abuse to women. 

 It gives a list of recommendations that are not binding on the government. 

 The UPA government wanted to get rid of Poornima Advani, who had acquired the reputation of being a ?handmaiden? to the NDA government.

 Sound of music in hills

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shillong, Jan. 24: Traditional musicians shared stage space with popular rock bands at the State Central Library here on Sunday evening, giving music aficionados the best of both worlds. 

 Ka Miet Ki Sur Nylla, an evening of fusion music, was organised by the Meghalaya tourism department as part of the Meghalaya Day celebrations. The department brought some of the best traditional musicians under one roof to revive the flavour and uniqueness of the music that has been reverberating in the hills of Meghalaya for ages. 

 ?This was, indeed, a rare opportunity for us to showcase out talents,? a local musician said, echoing the expressions of other artistes. 

 The artistes came from far-flung areas such as Nartiang, Sohra and Jaintia and Garo hills. Battamai Kurkalang and Bah Bilck and their group from Sohra and Cathrine Pyngrope and company enthralled music buffs with their performance on the duitara (a two-stringed instrument). 

 The talented young local singer, Nicholas Dunn, touched hearts with his lyrical notes sung to the accompaniment of flute recital by Shantiniketan-returned Benedict Hynniewta. ?The platform and the response from the audience was awesome,? said Nicholas.

 Besides music and songs, the evening also came alive with traditional dances. The Shad Pasthieh and Shad Pilang performed by a troupe from Nartiang in Jaintia hills and presented by the Hynniewtrep Cultural Welfare Organisation held the audience spellbound.

 Said Meghalaya tourism department director Hima Shangpliang: ?We were sure that the event would kick-start an affinity for traditional music among the younger generation, brought up on western music. The traditional music of Meghalaya is rich as well as interesting as it narrates folk tales.?

 Even before the show began, the traditional instruments had roused the curiosity of music buffs, some of whom had never heard these being played before. 

 Egnis, who swears by Dylan and Jim Morrison, said: ?There is so much to know about our state and its rich heritage. I had never heard the duitara before, but I loved it. It sounds like a cicada humming in the pines ? it?s so natural.?

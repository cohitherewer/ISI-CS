 11 tribals back from dead

 New Delhi, Jan. 9 (PTI): Eleven tribals of Little Nicobar Island were given up for dead until an intrepid group of securitymen rescued them.

 They survived a fortnight on a diet of green coconut water.

 The army and the air force had declared there was no survivor on the remote Little Nicobar, said Omvir Singh Vishnoi, an assistant commissioner of police from Delhi?s Tilak Nagar locality who led the rescue team.

 ?But we took a chance and were determined to get there after some tribals reported having spotted survivors,? Vishnoi said over telephone from Campbell Bay Island, where he has been sent on deputation.

 ?Some policemen, including myself, some CRPF troopers along with some local tribals sailed on a boat, MV Shompen, this morning to the island,? he said.

 ?After several hours of search, we located the 11 tribals hiding behind a tree at Lunur village around 3.30 pm.?

 They had escaped the killer waves on December 26 by scampering on to an elevated landmass and clinging on to trees, the police officer said, quoting the survivors.

 They survived on the water of green coconuts that hung from a few trees left unscathed by the tsunami, he added.

 ?This is indeed a remarkable example of the survival instinct of humans,? Vishnoi said.

 Seven-year-old Rowshni, who lost her parents and all her siblings, was one of those rescued.

 Vishnoi said many of the 11 had lost their family members. He cited the instance of Matthew, 35, who has lost his wife and two daughters.

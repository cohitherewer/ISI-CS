 Idlis on menu

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 16: No mincing words about his menu for this foodie: during his India visit he would like to eat only what is not available back home.

 That?s what the Pakistan high commission has told the chefs at Hotel Taj Mansingh. So for the next three days it will be puri chole, kachori, gulab jamun, chilman biryani, dal quereshi and, not to forget, idli-dosas for President Pervez Musharraf.

 ?He?s come for a short time and we have tried our best to tailor the menu to his tastes. We were told by the Pakistan high commission that he would like to have local food, which he does not get to eat back home,? said Taj executive chef Amit Chaudhary.

 Although Musharraf is known to prefer Awadhi cuisine and has a sweet tooth, Chaudhury said the hotel had taken special care to include south Indian food on his menu. On his last visit, he had gorged on Hyderabadi biryani and Malabari paratha and is believed to have loved it.

 ?We have added dishes like idli-dosa because we?ve been told he likes south Indian food a lot,? said Chaudhary.

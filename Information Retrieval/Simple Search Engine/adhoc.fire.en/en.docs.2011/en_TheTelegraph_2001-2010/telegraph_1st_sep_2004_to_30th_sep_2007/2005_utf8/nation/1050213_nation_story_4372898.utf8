 Infotech brain trust in making

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Feb. 12: Prime 

 Minister Manmohan Singh today gave a kick-start to the knowledge 

 commission the United Progressive Alliance had promised 

 to set up two months ago, announcing it will be put in place 

 in the next two weeks.

 The commission, which initially aimed at turning India into a one-stop infotech shop, will now incorporate IT for the common man as one of its themes. Post tsunami, stress is being put on harnessing IT expertise to predict natural disasters and disseminate the information.

 Three persons have been short-listed to head the panel: Infosys Technologies chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy, an IAS officer and R.A. Mashelkar, who once headed a committee on drugs.

 ?The knowledge commission will be headed by a dynamic and eminent individual to exploit the latent potential of our knowledge network and make India the knowledge engine of the world.

 ?We aim to make India the natural choice of all knowledge-based activity,? Singh said after inaugurating a sprawling Global Education Centre of Infosys Technologies Ltd in Mysore.

 The panel will encourage universities and research institutions to work on contemporary challenges. ?Our endeavour in future will be to increase the spending on R amp;D. We are spending less than 1 per cent of our GDP now, but I cannot say how much it will rise in one year,? he said.

 Manmohan also spoke of the Centre?s initiatives on convergence of technology, broadband connectivity and information and communication technology.

 He hailed Narayana Murthy as ?a national icon, a global brand, a source of inspiration for entrepreneurs and a role model for CEOs worldwide?. 

 On reported differences with the Left Front, Singh said: ?We value our relations with Left colleagues. From my experience, I see no insurmountable barriers to prevent our government from completing the five-year term. We will fulfil the commitments mentioned in our CMP.?

 Corruption ?curse?

 Voicing concern over financing of political parties becoming a major source of ?black income?, Singh sought a national consensus to help clean politics of ?the curse of corruption?.

 ?No single party can say that it can deal with the problem by itself?. Maybe the time has come when issues of state funding of elections should be on the agenda of the nation so that it can help clean our politics of the curse of corruption,? the Prime Minister said.

 Declaring he would be ?the last one to deny that corruption is a problem?, he added: ?Some measures have been taken but we have large areas where action is still called for. It requires a collective mobilisation of the will of the nation and a broad national consensus to push this process forward.?

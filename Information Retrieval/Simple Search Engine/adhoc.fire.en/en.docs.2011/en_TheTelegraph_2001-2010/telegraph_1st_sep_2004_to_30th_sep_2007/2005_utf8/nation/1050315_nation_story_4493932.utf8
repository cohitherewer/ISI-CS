 Stick for ?harassing? minister

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 14: The Uttar Pradesh government today suspended 13 officials for their alleged misbehaviour with a minister yesterday.

 The suspended officials include Ghaziabad city magistrate Sarvajeet Ram, additional district magistrate Chandra Prakash and two additional superintendents of police.

 The officials allegedly frisked and harassed state parliamentary affairs minister Azam Khan at a programme to inaugurate a Haj house in Ghaziabad. He was also reportedly not allowed to enter the venue though he was one of the key organisers.

 Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, who was to open the house and who Khan is believed to be close to, later skipped the function.

 Police claimed they did not recognise Khan, although a picture of his was hanging at the venue. They also seized Khan?s cellphone.

 ?I felt humiliated. I had to return. I have informed the chief minister. A probe has also been ordered into the incident,? Khan said.

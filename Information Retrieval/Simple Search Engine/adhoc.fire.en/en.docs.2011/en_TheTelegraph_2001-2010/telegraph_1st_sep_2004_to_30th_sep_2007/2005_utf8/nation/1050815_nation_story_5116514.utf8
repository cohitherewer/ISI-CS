 Inheritance bill row brews

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: Thanks to the National Advisory Council (NAC) headed by Sonia Gandhi, Hindu women, especially in rural areas, could be entitled to their rightful share of ancestral property.

 That is, if the amended Hindu Succession Act, 2004, is ratified by Parliament. The amended legislation, cleared by the Union cabinet two weeks ago, will be introduced this week.

 But if the mood in the political establishment is an indicator, the amended bill could meet the same fate as the womens reservation bill.

 Among the far-reaching changes mooted by the cabinet are removing discriminations against women in the inheritance of arable land. In its communication to the government last month, the NAC noted: Since land ownership is a basic pre-requisite for dignity and economic development, we trust that the government would accord this matter the priority it deserves.

 Government sources said the amendment seeks to do away with anomalies in state laws on the access women have to arable land and related issues ? fragmentation of agricultural holdings, fixation of ceiling and devolution of tenancy rights ? and make it incumbent on governments to implement the new law.

 For instance, in tenurial laws operating in Haryana, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, the specified rules of devolution show a strong preference for agnatic (an agnate is one who is descended by male line from the same male ancestor) succession, with preference for agnatic males.

 In all these states, land (ownership and inheritance) devolves in the first instance on male lineal descendants in the male line of descent. Except in Uttar Pradesh, a widow inherits only in the absence of male heirs. Daughters and sisters are excluded as heirs.

 BJP sources said party members from western Uttar Pradesh and Punjab and the Shiromani Akali Dal have already opposed it. The issue will be discussed in an NDA meeting on Tuesday.

 The Akalis reportedly made it clear the changes had to be viewed in concert with the skewed male-female ratio in Punjab and Haryana ? because of rampant female foeticide ? and if the land had to be shared by women, it may encourage the practice further.

 The Samajwadi Party and its ally, Rashtriya Lok Dal, are not in favour of it. 

 Publicly we cannot oppose the bill, said BJP MP V.K. Malhotra, and if we support it together with the Congress and Left, there will be no problem.

 A woman (married, unmarried or in any other capacity) can hold only a limited interest in the land in that after her death, the holding goes not to her heirs but to the heir of the last male landowner. 

 She also forfeits the land if she remarries or does not cultivate the land for a year.

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) chief will leave shortly for Afghanistan to assess the security situation in the country where an Indian, Maniappan Raman Kutty, was slaughtered by the Taliban.

 Maniappan, a driver with the BRO, was abducted last Saturday when he and three others were travelling by car in Nimroze province.

 The BRO is building an important link road in the area that will help India bypass Pakistan in reaching goods to various parts of Afghanistan after shipping them to a port in Iran. Maniappan, 36, who leaves behind a family of five, was working on this project.

 Although a decision will be taken only after BRO director-general Lt Gen. K.S. Rao returns from Afghanistan, India is thinking of increasing substantially the strength of the 40-member Indo-Tibetan Border Police team guarding the BRO camps.

 While the ITBP will guard the camps or the work sites, India will have to depend on Afghan authorities for security to the employees when they are on the move. Delhi is in touch with Kabul about this.

 As many as 290 Indians are working for the BRO in the country and 600 more are engaged in different projects in various parts of Afghanistan.

 The Opposition has accused the government of being slow to negotiate with Maniappans abductors to save his life. But South Block officials say the kidnappers did not want to talk, they wanted to send a political message to India to leave Afghanistan. A note in English pinned on Maniappans body read: This is not India or America. Indians should go out.

 Although Delhi has not named Pakistan, it is convinced about the external links of the Taliban with elements in Islamabad, if not the Musharraf regime.

 South Block officials said from the time India learnt of Maniappans abduction, all attempts were made to secure his release, by engaging with Afghan authorities and religious and tribal leaders, as well as with the US, Iran, China and European countries.

 But no direct link with the abductors was established, a senior official said. Delhi was prepared with contingency plans, including an expert to negotiate with the Taliban, he added. However, they never got in touch with us.

 That the Indian driver was separated from the others travelling with him ? an Afghan driver and two security guards ? has raised suspicion about the abductors intention. The Afghan driver has been released while the fate of the other two is not known.

 Left raises Posco battle cry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, July 24: The Left parties have decided to start a nationwide campaign against the memorandum of understanding signed between the Orissa government and South Korean steel major Posco for setting up a 12-million-tonne capacity steel plant in the state.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan said today the agitation against Posco would be the stepping stone to building national opinion against a proposal to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the mining sector.

 The Posco deal is not only harmful for Orissa, but for the country as well. It would mean large-scale displacement, Karat said.

 Bardhan said the Left parties had sought the Prime Ministers intervention on the deal but instead, he tried to convince us that the huge foreign direct investment (Posco is investing $12 billion, the highest foreign investment in India) would help the state. When there is no one to listen at the top, people in grassroots have to fight.

 The CPM general secretary said the existing National Mineral Policy is faulty and successive governments in Delhi have systematically allowed foreign players to exploit our non-renewable and strategic resources.

 The policy is heavily tilted in favour of a few big industrial houses while the poor tribal population pays the price for it, said Karat. The mining policy was the root cause of all disturbances, he said.

 Both Karat and Bardhan said they would raise the issue at different national fora to shape a better mineral policy.

 Prabhat Patnaik, an economics professor of Jawaharlal Nehru University who was also present, came down heavily on the manner in which mines were leased out to private players. When the question of exploitation of natural resources belonging to people is concerned, the issue should not be left to the mercy of a handful of bureaucrats. 

 He said any investment of the magnitude like the Posco deal must have the appropriate approval of legislators and must be backed by legislation.

 Patnaik also raised the point of inter-generation equity that says no government can exhaust all natural resources within a certain period of time.

 The present Orissa government cant exhaust all the mineral resources within the span of one generation. It seems to have no respect for ethical rights of tribals and future generations. After exhausting all resources, the state would become pauper, he warned.

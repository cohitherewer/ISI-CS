The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Political donation by an Indian: ?2 million

 AMIT ROY

 London, July 14: Lakshmi 

 Mittal, the biggest steel-maker in the world, has taken 

 the Indian rich set by surprise by yesterday announcing 

 a ?2-million donation to the Labour Party.

 Considering he was very upset at the controversy caused by his relatively modest gift of ?125,000 four years ago, many expected him to steer clear of Labour or any other political party. 

 But it seems that the Indian-born tycoon, whose Mittal Steel Company is the largest steel firm in the world, is enamoured of Tony Blair and New Labour.

 Mittal made London the base for his international operations eight years ago when he moved to the UK from Indonesia.

 Although he has given no indication that he is interested in politics ? Bollywood is more to his liking ? Mittal issued a ringing endorsement of Blair yesterday.

 He cannot be accused of seeking a peerage or a knighthood because he has said he is proud to remain an Indian passport-holder. The money was going to be announced last week but he held it back because of the London bombings.

 I believe that the Labour Party has made a significant and very positive impact on the overall prosperity of the United Kingdom since it came to office in 1997, said Mittal. The party has set out long-term investment plans to further improve education, health, employment, skills and technology and I am supportive of the work it is doing in these fields.

 Mittal has had a much more favourable press in America. In 2004, he was awarded Fortune magazines European Businessman of the Year Award and the Wall Street Journals Entrepreneur of the Year Award. 

 He is chairman and chief executive of Mittal Steel Company, the worlds largest and most global steel company that has operations in 14 countries and employs some 179,000 people worldwide.

 A Labour spokesperson said the donation was among the largest cheques the party has ever received. 

 We are grateful to everyone who contributes whatever they can to the Labour party. We appreciate this very generous donation and thank Lakshmi Mittal for his continued support, said the spokesperson.

 The money matches the amount given by Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, before the general election in May.

 Meanwhile, less is clear about Mittals investment plans in India or whether he wants to set up a plant in Jharkhand or in neighbouring Chhattisgarh. 

 Talks are continuing, is all his spokesperson would say.

 As to why he is giving ?2 million, a highly placed Indian source had this nugget to offer: I dont think he wants to be in the House of Lords. He just wants to show he is making a contribution to Britain. He wants to be seen as a good boy. ?2 million is a lot of money for you and me but for him its loose change.

 Another was more cynical: You dont have to be a British national in order to seek a favour.

 Paswan digs in heels

 Paswan: Adamant

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Ram Vilas Paswan is sticking to his anti-Laloo Prasad Yadav line for the Bihar elections though the Congress has mounted pressure on him to join an all-inclusive UPA alliance.

 The Lok Janshakti Party leader, who met Sonia Gandhi today, repeated his demand for a Muslim chief minister.

 I told her that if the RJD could float the name of Rabri Devi as the chief ministerial candidate and the NDA could prop up the name of Nitish Kumar, then why is my demand for a Muslim chief minister being dubbed unrealistic, he said after the hour-long meeting.

 Briefing reporters after the meeting, AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh said Sonia told Paswan we cannot wait forever and he should make up his mind whether to go along with the RJD-led United Progressive Alliance by September 23, the day the poll process starts.

 The Congress has already made it clear that it would not hesitate to field candidates against Paswans nominees if he persisted with his stand of having nothing to do with Laloo Prasad unless the RJD chief accepts his proposal for a Muslim chief minister.

 Party sources, however, dismissed reports that Sonia had virtually served an ultimatum on Paswan to choose between being part of the UPA and fighting the elections outside the umbrella.

 Paswan, the sources said, was urged to give up his insistence on projecting a Muslim chief minister. 

 How can you say that the chief minister should belong to a particular religious community? You can project a candidate but it is not correct to say that the chief minister should belong to a particular religion, said a source.

 Singh said Paswans rigid stand and plans to float a third front with the CPI and the CPI (ML) would only help the Janata Dal (United)-National Democratic Alliance.

 Asked if Paswan would be told to quit the UPA government at the Centre if he did not join the alliance in Bihar, Singh said Sonia would take a decision. The central coalition chairperson will take stock of the situation with Laloo Prasad when the railway minister meets her tomorrow.

 Singh, who is preparing for seat-sharing talks with Laloo Prasad, is understood to have identified 114 seats as favourable for the Congress. The AICC leader hopes the RJD chief would leave at least 50-55 of those seats for the party.

 Last time, the Congress leadership had turned down Laloo Prasads offer of 25 seats.

 Laloo blinks first in seat scrap

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: The Congress today told Laloo Prasad Yadav to mind his language as the war of nerves between the two sides continued over seat-sharing in Bihar and Jharkhand.

 At an inconclusive meeting, Congress negotiator Arjun Singh told the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief he could not push the party around and that he should not rush to the media with his grievances.

 Laloo Prasad, stumped by the Congress sewing up an alliance with the JMM, had yesterday threatened to go it alone, saying ?if they (Congress) do not need us (in Jharkhand), we also do not need them (in Bihar)?. 

 But Laloo Prasad appears to have blinked first as his bete noire Ram Vilas Paswan renewed his alliance offer to the Congress. 

 After declaring yesterday that he would not talk to any Congress leader other than Sonia Gandhi, the RJD leader called on Singh at his residence today.

 Emerging from the two-hour meeting, Laloo Prasad said he was a ?trusted ally? of the Congress and ?it is our duty to take along alliance partners in the Assembly polls?.

 ?There is no question of complaints. We will contest jointly by sorting out differences.? The talks, Laloo Prasad added, would continue till a positive outcome was reached to defeat ?communal? forces.

 Asked to comment on his outburst yesterday, the railway minister, with Singh by his side, shot back: ?Can?t you see we are standing together? Arjun Singh is a respected senior leader and our guardian.?

 Singh said: ?Today?s talks are successful.? The talks will resume on Tuesday.

 Paswan, the Lok Janshakti Party leader, had yesterday made his package more attractive with the offer of chief ministership to the Congress.

 The Congress assessment is that the RJD needs it more, rather than the other way round. Laloo Prasad, the party reckons, cannot cross over to the National Democratic Alliance as his politics depends on overwhelming support from Muslims and Yadavs.

 Besides, the RJD has seven ministers, including two holding the important portfolios of railway and rural development, in the United Progressive Alliance government.

 Laloo Prasad left for Patna late this evening and is expected back on Tuesday. He had waited in vain throughout yesterday for a call from Sonia.

 Sources said the RJD chief had a word with Sonia on the sidelines of an all-party meeting on tsunami convened this morning by the Prime Minister. Sonia is reported to have told him to talk to Arjun Singh.

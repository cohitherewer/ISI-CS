 Bilkis in court, not before judge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 8: A special court hearing the Bilkis Bano rape case today directed that fresh summons be served to her after being told that she had failed to turn up for the hearing for the second successive time.

 However, CBI prosecutor R.K. Shah insisted that Bilkis did not fail to report before the special court judge, U.D. Salvi, but was neither produced before the court nor examined today.

 The court adjourned the hearing of the case till February 21 after the defence sought more time to prepare for the in-camera trial.

 After the hearing, Shah said: ?Bilkis was present in a closed room on the court premises during this hearing and the previous hearing. However, she was not examined today.?

 Asked why Bilkis was not presented before the judge, he said: ?We do not want her to be influenced by anything.?

 The judge directed that a fresh summons be served on Bilkis, one of the two prime witnesses in the case.

 Earlier, the prosecution had argued for an in-camera trial stating that gang rape was a serious offence and Bilkis? testimony was significant to the case. 

 She was among the three survivors when a mob attacked and killed 17 people in Devgarh Baria village of Dahod district in Gujarat on March 3, 2002, in the aftermath of the Godhra riots.

 According to the police, a six-month pregnant Bilkis was gangraped, while her three-year-old daughter Saleha was snatched from her and killed by smashing her on the ground.

 The court heard the matter pertaining to the trial of Sangeeta Prasad, the 20th accused in the case.

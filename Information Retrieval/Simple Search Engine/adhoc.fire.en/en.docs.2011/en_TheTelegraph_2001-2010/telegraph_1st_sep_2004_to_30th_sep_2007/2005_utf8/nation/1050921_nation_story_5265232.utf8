 Kurien scores sack victory

 Ahmedabad: Verghese Kurien, known as 

 the father of the White Revolution, scored a victory on 

 Tuesday with Gujarat High Court setting aside the reinstatement 

 of K. Pratap Reddy, who was sacked in April as director 

 of the Institute of Rural Management, Anand, reports our 

 correspondent.

 Reddy had challenged his sacking in court, arguing that since he had been appointed by the board of governors, Kurien, the institutes chairman, didnt have the authority to remove him.

 The single-judge bench of R.M. Shah had reinstated Reddy, but a division bench on Tuesday held that the judge had not strictly followed the institutes constitution and sent the matter back to Justice Shahs court. 

 Kurien had challenged Reddys reinstatement on the ground that his term had expired on September 2 and that some board members, whose tenure had also expired, had passed an illegal resolution extending the directors term by three months.

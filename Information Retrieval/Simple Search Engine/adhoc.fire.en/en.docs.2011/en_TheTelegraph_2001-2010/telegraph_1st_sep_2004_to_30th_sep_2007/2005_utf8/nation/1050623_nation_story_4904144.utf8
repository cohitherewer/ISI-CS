 Metro driving force eyes exit

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 E. Shreedharan

 New Delhi, June 22: E. Shreedharan, the man behind the antidote to the capitals traffic problems, wants to call it a day after eight years in the saddle.

 As the Delhi Metro rail races to complete the final section of its first phase by the end of the year, sources said the 73-year-old chairman and managing director has communicated his wish to step down once his extension ends in November.

 Top officials of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) are aware of Shreedharans plan to demit office. A letter sent recently to the Delhi transport department by the corporations company secretary regarding routine appointments mentioned that it would like the appointments finalised before Shreedharan demits office by November.

 The DMRC is a joint initiative of the Centre and the Delhi government. The Union urban development ministry appoints the chairman and managing director on the recommendations of the Delhi government.

 Shreedharan, who also heads the advisory team planning the extension of the Calcutta Metro, was appointed head of the DMRC in 1997 when the government was still preparing the groundwork for the project. His success at Konkan Railway had then Delhi chief secretary P.V. Jayakrishnan rallying for his appointment.

 Although the railway ministry opposed the appointment of the then 65-year-old Shreedharan on the ground that he exceeded the age limit for such extensions, Shreedharan was given a three-year extension.

 In 2000, the question of his extension came up again just when the project had begun to take shape. Several former railway ministry officials were in the race for the prestigious assignment. But with chief minister Sheila Dikshit backing him, Shreedharan got a rare second chance.

 By 2001, a year short of the inauguration of the Metro rails first run in Delhi, Shreedharan got another extension till November 2005.

 Sources said Shreedharan is keen to leave the Metro rail on a high note. 

 He has already been flooded with offers of foreign assignments and from several cities in India to start similar projects.

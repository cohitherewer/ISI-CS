 Boycott a blessing in disguise for Left

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, May 5: The BJP-led Oppositions decision to boycott Parliament has come as a blessing in disguise for the ruling coalition. 

 The boycott, which began on April 27 and entered its eighth day today, was called by the NDA in protest against the United Progressive Alliance governments ?undemocratic and intemperate? attitude. 

 Left parties have benefited particularly as they have filled in the role of the Opposition.

 The cabinet yesterday cleared 11 bills. With the BJP and some allies continuing the boycott, the UPA will be able to introduce most of them and even pass a few by the time the House adjourns sine die on May 13. In the NDAs absence, the House was able to transact business smoothly.

 The House was in turmoil from day one when it met after a recess till April 26. 

 The alleged attack on railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav by Sangh parivar activists in Vadodara and the controversial defence deals signed during George Fernandess tenure as defence minister rocked the House. 

 When a CBI special court filed charges against Laloo Prasad in the fodder scam, the BJP revived the ?tainted minister? slogan. 

 After forcing repeated adjournments, the NDA began its boycott from April 27, though it made an exception for the discussion on the finance bill for a day. 

 Here is a list of the important business transacted till May 5:

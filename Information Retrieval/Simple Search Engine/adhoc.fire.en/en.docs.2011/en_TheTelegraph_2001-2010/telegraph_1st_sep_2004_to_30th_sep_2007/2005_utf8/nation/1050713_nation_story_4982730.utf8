 High-level security meet

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 12: The Centre today convened a high-level meeting to tackle the new face of terror on a nudge from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Sources said Singh, back from the G8 summit in Scotland that was rocked by the London blasts, prodded the home ministry to call the meeting as he is keen to beef up internal security in the face of the increased global threat perception.

 The Prime Minister has taken terrorism as a new challenge especially after the London blasts. He wants internal security strengthened in the wake of the change in terrorists methodology and targets. There are signs he is not fully satisfied with the working of intelligence agencies, a source said.

 A decision is believed to have been taken to evolve a new security mechanism to protect sensitive places and installations. 

 But national security adviser M.K. Narayanan refused to divulge details.

 We do not want terrorists to know how we are planning to deal with them. But we are taking all possible steps to thwart their designs. We are also studying what other countries are doing, he said.

 Apart from Narayanan, the meeting was attended by junior home minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, the cabinet secretary, directors general of paramilitary forces, chiefs of internal security agencies and top home ministry officials.

 Jaiswal said the meeting discussed the possible change in terrorists strategy in moving out of Jammu and Kashmir and pulling off unconventional attacks elsewhere, as in Ayodhya last week.

 It was decided to apply a new security mechanism for the Delhi and Calcutta metros because of the increased threat perception. A new mechanism will be worked out for ports, airports, places of worship and other installations. The changes in terrorists methodology warrants changes in our methodology and security mechanisms too, he said.

 Sources said the Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing had been asked to beef up their information gathering network. Paramilitary forces have been asked to come up with proposals to tackle the new face of terror.

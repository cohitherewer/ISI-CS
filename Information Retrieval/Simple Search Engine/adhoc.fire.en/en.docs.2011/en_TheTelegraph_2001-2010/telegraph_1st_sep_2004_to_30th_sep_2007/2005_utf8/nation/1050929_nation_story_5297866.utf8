The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Forces move in, but many flights off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: Air force personnel have moved in to lessen the impact of tomorrows nation-wide airport strike, but airline services are likely to be hit across the country and totally paralysed in Calcutta.

 Jet and Sahara have cancelled flights to and from the Bengal capital, seen as the focal point of the strike called by Left unions Citu and Aituc in protest against privatisation of some airports and the Centres economic policies. State-run Indian Airlines, however, said it would operate five to six flights to and from the city.

 Airlines also said they were clubbing flights on other sectors like Delhi-Mumbai because of cancellations. A Jet Airway spokesperson said air links to Calcutta and the Northeast would be the worst hit.

 My advice is dont fly tomorrow, said CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta who also heads Aituc. 

 I have already called up civil aviation minister Praful Patel to tell him it is risky to get semi-trained IAF personnel to run modern civilian airports and any mishap would rest on his shoulder.

 But the Centre is determined that the Left, which backs the ruling coalition, will not have its way anywhere else except in Calcutta, its bastion. 

 Officials said they would see to it that most airports worked normally with help from officers, engineers and air traffic controllers who are not going on strike while air force and navy personnel would back up the efforts.

 Civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad said a notification has been issued to act against those indulging in violence or sabotage.

 There will be no compromise on the safety standards and necessary steps have been taken to ensure that all flights operate with full safety measures in force, Prasad said. We have also asked the state governments to maintain law and order as well as ensure that passengers do not face any problem while reaching or coming out of airports.

 Of some 124 functional airports, 78 are operational and handle air services regularly.

 Defence officials said air force personnel have already moved in to airports. The air forces regional commands have allotted duties to staff for the airports in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai. While IAF air traffic controllers will be on standby, the air force has already begun to take over the functions of airfield safety.

 The air forces regional commands have also been asked to be prepared to take responsibility for 22 civilian airports, some of which the IAF co-manages with the Airports Authority of India.

 Dasgupta said the strike would be the largest called by trade unions in the last 10 years and involve millions of workers.

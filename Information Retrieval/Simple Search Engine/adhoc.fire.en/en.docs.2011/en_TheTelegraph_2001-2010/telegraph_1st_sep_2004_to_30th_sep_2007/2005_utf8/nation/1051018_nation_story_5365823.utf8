 Reprieved CM returns sting

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Oct. 17: A day after declaring war on Babulal Gaur, Uma Bharti turned to prayer.

 She went to Ujjains Mahakal temple today during the lunar eclipse, which comes 13 days after the solar eclipse ? a rare and ominous occurrence. A similar pair of eclipses had occurred some time before the battle of Kurukshetra.

 On the Bhopal battlefield, a triumphant Gaur demanded the resignation of some ministers who had joined Umas campaign. Now that you have lost faith in me, how about resigning? the chief minister asked sarcastically, minutes after earning a reprieve from Delhi.

 But the ministers refused, saying if Gaur wished, he was free to sack them.

 Earlier in the day, the state BJP tried to gag the MLAs gunning for Gaur. Four ministers loyal to the chief minister came out in the open asking for the resignation of about a dozen of their colleagues for expressing dissatisfaction with Gaurs leadership. 

 In separate statements, ministers Jayant Malliya, Raghavji, Kailash Vijayvargiya and Umashankar Gupta said those unhappy with Gaur were free to quit the government.

 The chief minister tried to portray a business-as-usual attitude and chaired a cabinet meeting. 

 State BJP chief Shivraj Singh Chauhan, along with party leaders Kaptan Singh Solanki and Kailash Joshi, summoned the dissidents. They were told the party did not approve of their joining a signature campaign to oust Gaur. But most of the 100-odd BJP MLAs stuck to their stand. 

 Uma will return from Ujjain tomorrow to hold a religious discourse. 

 Her loyalists have not given up hope of turning the tide. A move is afoot to send MLAs to Delhi to press for a change of leadership. Umas supporters went into a huddle today to chalk out their future strategy. 

 The battle is far from over and the lunar eclipse may well take its toll.

 Bardhan ?prophecy? upsets PM

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is unhappy with CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan for saying ?bad days are ahead of the UPA government? if it persists with its economic policies.

 Singh called him up on his mobile after he made the remark at the inaugural session of the CPI state conference in Andhra Pradesh two days ago. Bardhan was in the middle of another conference when the call came. Singh asked Bardhan what he meant by ?bad days? and what the ?provocation? for the outburst was.

 In his address, Bardhan had said some UPA cabinet ministers had ?hidden their faces? when asked about the government decision to increase FDI cap in telecom. ?These ministers asked me to put the question to Chidambaram, Montek Singh Ahluwalia and the Prime Minister.?

 Bardhan also asked Sonia Gandhi to advise her colleagues to ?mend their ways?. ?Bad days are ahead of the government if you continue to ignore our reservations. You must ask the government as UPA chairperson to take note of the communists,? he said.

 The CPI leader told Singh ? who felt the finger was pointed at him ? his party was under pressure from its cadre and supporters to take a hard stand on FDI and disinvestment.

 Study scheme scanner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: Concerned over the quality of education in the government-sponsored Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, experts have decided to put the project under the public scanner.

 For the next two months, Pratham, a Mumbai-based NGO along with a network of other organisations will conduct a citizens audit. The high-profile project was launched by the government in 2002 to ensure elementary education for all.

 The survey will be spread over 11,500 villages in 575 districts covering 60 lakh children to find out the status of elementary education, said Madhav Chavan of Pratham. The report should be ready by the end of January.

 Last year, Pratham had carried out a similar exercise. The findings revealed a gross mismatch between the data supplied by the government and that collected by the NGO.

 The Pratham report showed that 90 per cent of children were enrolled in schools. But 45 per cent in the 7-10 age group could not read words. An alarming 60 per cent could not write a simple sentence dictated to them, while 75 per cent could not solve subtraction problems. 

 We would congratulate the government if our data matched that of the government. If not, our report should be a reminder, said Chavan.

 Two days ago, Unesco released a report on the status of literacy and education, which showed that 46 per cent of the worlds adult illiterate population lives in India and China. The human resource development ministry contested the finding on the ground that it was not based on the 2001 census data.

 Pratham volunteers have prepared a set of questions for community members. Some of them are: 

 Is there a school in the 

 village? 

 Are there enough rooms 

 and adequate facilities? 

 Are there enough teachers 

 and textbooks?

 Are the schools providing 

 mid-day meals?

 By 2010, India is expected to fulfil its commitment to achieve universalisation of elementary education. Unesco officials, however, told a news conference that they were not too hopeful. Even if the goal is met, the quality of education is bothering the experts.

 Court orders MLA arrest 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 31: Patna High Court today directed the government to arrest four ?absconding? MLAs who face non-bailable warrants of arrest and property attachment orders.

 The four MLAs in question are Surendra Yadav (Belaganj), Prahlad Yadav (Barsoi) and Pappu Khan (Biharsharif) of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Muhammad Alam (Suryagarh) of the CPI-ML.

 The division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S.N. Hussain passed the order asking the government to arrest them before February 7 while hearing the petitions of some voters who informed the court that the four were openly going around campaigning for the elections despite their ?wanted? status. 

 Of the four, Surendra Yadav has been asked to surrender by February 4 and the police have to arrest the rest before February 7, when the case will be taken up again.

 The same court had on January 27 ordered Gaya police to arrest Yadav by issuing a fresh warrant. 

 Earlier, a BJP candidate had observed in the court that Yadav, a wanted criminal, got away with filing his nomination papers for the Belaganj constituency. 

 The court had directed the government on January 7 to produce a list of all wanted and absconding criminals and arrest them when they arrived to file their nominations.

 However, the police have failed to arrest Yadav, although they have arrested a few other ?absconding? politicians of the state.

 The court also had a few strong words for inspector general (headquarters) Neelmani for his department?s failure to execute court orders.

 ?The court is determined to ensure free, fair and fearless elections in Bihar this time?it is the need of the hour,? said advocate Mahendra Prasad Gupta who filed the IMA petition in the high court about eight months ago.

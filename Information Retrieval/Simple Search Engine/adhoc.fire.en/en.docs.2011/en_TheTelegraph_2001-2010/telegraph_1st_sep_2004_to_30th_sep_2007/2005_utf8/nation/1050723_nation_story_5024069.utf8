 Fighter show to woo forces

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 22: The Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy will be given a presentation on the F/A-18 Superhornet aircrafts performance in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq shortly, a senior executive of Boeing, the company that manufactures the fighter, said here today.

 Boeing is currently executing multi-year contracts to supply the US Navy with the aircraft for about $53.8 million each. The price of the Superhornet for India will be dependent on the size of the order and the demands of the IAF. 

 Washington has said the F/A-18 Superhornet, along with the Lockheed Martin-produced F-16, are being allowed to bid for a huge IAF contract for 126 multi-role combat aircraft. 

 Air headquarters is currently vetting the requests for information that it had sent out to and the responses it has received from the manufacturers of the F-16, the Mirage 2000-V, the Grippen and MiG-29M/M2.

 Boeings expression of interest to sell its F/A-18 aircraft to India comes even as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is winding up a tour of the US that he has said will foster bilateral cooperation in nuclear, military and economic cooperation.

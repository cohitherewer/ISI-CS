 New Delhi, Sept. 9: Chaos reigned at Indira Gandhi International Airport today as passengers had to be evacuated when a fire broke out at a terminal.

 Fire department officials said the blaze started around 9 am in the computer room at terminal 1B. While they claimed the fire was caused by a short circuit in the room and smoke drifted into the departure lounge through the air-conditioning vent, ministry officials said a mechanical or electrical fault was to blame.

 People who had queued up with their luggage near the conveyor belt saw the smoke. Airport officials swung into action and evacuated the passengers from the terminal.

 Computers were damaged in the fire, which was brought under control by four to five fire tenders around 10.30 am. The terminal was functional again from 1 pm.

 Several passengers were stranded for over two hours as eight flights were disrupted. Among them were actor Mahima Chaudhary who was waiting to take a flight to Pune and Hurriyat leader Abdul Ghani Bhatt who was on his way to Srinagar.

 Almost all Jet Airways flights to and from Calcutta were delayed. According to Jet officials in Calcutta, the departure of almost all the flights to Delhi, Mumbai and other parts of the country was deferred by one to three hours. The arrival of several Jet Airways flights at Calcutta was also delayed. Air-Indias Calcutta-London flight was also delayed by two hours.

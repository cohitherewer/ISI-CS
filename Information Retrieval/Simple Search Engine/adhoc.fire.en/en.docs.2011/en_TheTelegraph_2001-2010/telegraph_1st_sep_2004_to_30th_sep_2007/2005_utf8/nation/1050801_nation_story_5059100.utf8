 Character proof for job extension

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme 

 Court has directed courts and tribunals to wait for evidence 

 that a soon-to-retire public servant has an unimpeachable 

 character before granting him any interim relief in case 

 of an age dispute.

 The court or the tribunal 

 must, therefore, be slow in granting an interim relief or 

 continuation in service, unless prima facie evidence of 

 unimpeachable character is produced, the court said.

 If the public servant succeeds, he can always be compensated, but if he fails, he would have enjoyed undeserved benefit of extended service and thereby caused injustice to his immediate junior. 

 The court noted that a recent trend of public servants, on the eve of their retirement, raising a dispute about their service records and correctness of their dates of birth.

 And even if ultimately their applications are dismissed, by virtue of interim orders, they continue for months after the date of superannuation, the court said.

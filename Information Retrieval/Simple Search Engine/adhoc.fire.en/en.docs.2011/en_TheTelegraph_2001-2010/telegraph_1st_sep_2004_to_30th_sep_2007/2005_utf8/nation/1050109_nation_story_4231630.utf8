 BJP to contest 65 seats in Jharkhand

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: The BJP today decided to contest 65 of the 81 constituencies in Jharkhand, leaving the remaining seats for allies. 

 Party sources indicated 15 constituencies will be left for the Janata Dal (U) and one for the All Jharkhand Students Union. The BJP had won 33 of these seats in the last poll held in 1999 in undivided Bihar.

 In the first list of candidates released today, BJP dropped six of its sitting legislators and instead nominated four former MPs, who had lost the Lok Sabha election last year, to contest for Assembly seats. 

 Prominent among the former MPs is former Union minister Karia Munda, who will be contesting for the Khijri seat. 

 Other former MPs nominated are Laxman Gilua, Som Marandi and Pradeep Yadav. State BJP president Raghuvar Das will contest from Jamshedpur (East). 

 The party has also fielded the son of late Binod Bihari Mahato, a prominent Kurmi leader, from Sindri.

 The BJP?s central election committee will meet here again tomorrow to decide on the 13 remaining candidates in Jharkhand and also to consider names for Bihar. 

 Several important constituencies like Dhanbad and Jamshedpur (West) were left out of the first list and indications are that a few more former MPs could be thrown into the ring. 

 The committee is also expected to decide on whether to field former chief minister Babulal Marandi, the solitary BJP candidate to win a Lok Sabha seat from Jharkhand in the last general election. 

 Party sources said Marandi?s name is being considered and that he himself is keen to contest. A decision on Marandi was, however, deferred today at the last moment, apparently because the committee could not decide upon a constituency for him. 

 Chief minister Arjun Munda?s name, however, figured in the first list from Kharsawan constituency.

 Among the 52 names released on Saturday, only three happened to be women, two of them new faces. 

 While the sitting MLA from Potka Menaka Sardar has been re-nominated, the party has decided to field the widow of Surajdeo Singh from Jharia and Lalsa Singh from Koderma. 

 Kunti Singh, the Dhanbad don?s widow, had formally joined the BJP in Jharia a few weeks ago.

 Eighteen sitting MLAs figure in BJP?s first list and even if the party decides to retain all the sitting MLAs in the 13 seats to be decided tomorrow, heads of more sitting MLAs are likely to roll. 

 The sitting MLAs dropped are Arun Mandal, Phulchand Mandal, R.C. Naik, Dinesh Oraon, A.R. Tuddu and Chunna Oraon.

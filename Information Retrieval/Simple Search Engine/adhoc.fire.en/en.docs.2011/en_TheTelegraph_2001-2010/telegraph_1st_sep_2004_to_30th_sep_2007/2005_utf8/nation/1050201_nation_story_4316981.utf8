 Rs 600-crore grant for Orissa

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 30: The British government?s department for international development (DFID) is likely to provide a grant of Rs 600 crore per annum to Orissa for the next four years to implement schemes in social sectors and carry forward fiscal and civil service reforms in the state.

 During his meeting with chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday, British deputy high commissioner to eastern India, Andrew Hall, said Orissa was one of the focus states for DFID and assured that the funds flow would not stop.

 The issue of stopping direct budgetary support to the state also figured in the meeting. Hall told the chief minister that the issue needs to be settled with the Centre, which was against the idea of providing direct budgetary aid.

 The other major issue discussed was financial support to the state government to leverage larger funds under Centre-sponsored schemes for sectors dealing with Millennium Development Goals like health, education, sanitation and drinking water.

 At present, DFID-funded projects such as Western Orissa Rural Livelihood Project, Orissa Tribal Empowerment and Livelihood Programme, District Primary Education Programme and Public Sector Reforms Programme are under implementation.

 Patnaik said since the assistance was in the form of a grant, accessing the agency?s funds for social sectors would be extremely beneficial for the state.

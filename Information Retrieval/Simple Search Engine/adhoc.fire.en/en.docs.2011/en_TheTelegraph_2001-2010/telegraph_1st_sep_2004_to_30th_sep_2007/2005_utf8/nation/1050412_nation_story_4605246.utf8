 Sonia on hold, Sangh keeps BJP hands full

 KAY BENEDICT

 Vajpayee

 New Delhi, April 11: Top BJP leaders emerged tonight from a huddle with a statement that expressed total faith in the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani, as the party took on the chief of its political parent.

 The RSS, too, sought to play down sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan?s comments in a television interview that Vajpayee and Advani should make way for younger leaders. The RSS said it has always held the two in high esteem and the BJP needed their ?leadership and guidance?.

 The BJP?s original plan for the day was to attack Congress chief Sonia Gandhi for meeting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao before he called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The party felt it was one more example of her position as ?super PM? and an ?extra-constitutional authority?.

 The BJP was also planning to target the ?differences in the Union cabinet? over the ?clean chit? to former defence minister George Fernandes in the Kargil procurement case. But the party cancelled its daily briefing and shifted a meeting of general secretaries on organisational revamp to discuss Sudarshan?s comments.

 Advani, who talked to Vajpayee over phone, convened the meeting at his residence. Midway through the meeting, attended among others by Jaswant Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Pramod Mahajan, Rajnath Singh and Ananth Kumar, Jaswant drove to Vajpayee?s residence, presumably to show him a draft of a statement they planned to release to the press.

 Jaitley later read out a statement that said the party has ?noted? Sudarshan?s comment but had total faith in Vajpayee and Advani?s leadership and was of the opinion that the NDA government under Vajpayee?s leadership was ?one of the best performing governments of the country?.

 In the interview, the RSS chief had said he did not rate Vajpayee among the country?s best Prime Ministers. He also said that he had warned Vajpayee about his foster son-in-law dabbling in party and government affairs. 

 Sources said a livid Advani spoke to Sudarshan last night and asked him whether the Sangh chief wanted him to step down as BJP president. The sources, however, said the RSS chief?s prime target was Vajpayee who had, in any case, expressed his desire to quit active politics and the mention of Advani was incidental. 

 The RSS today tried to control the damage. Senior-most leader Mohan Bhagwat issued a statement saying the remarks were taken ?out of context to create an erroneous impression?. The RSS, he added, is of the firm view that Advani should ?continue as the president? of the BJP.

 Spokesman Ram Madhav said the RSS considered Vajpayee a ?highly respected leader of our movement?. Asked if Sudarshan?s remarks would affect Sangh-BJP ties, he said their relationship is based on ideology. ?I am sure it will not affect our relationship. There is also a conscious effort to maintain good relations.?

 US official on arms mission 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: A senior US state department official is in New Delhi giving a briefing on Washingtons military sales programme to officials of the Indian defence and external affairs ministries for anticipated major arms transfers.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is slated to visit the US next month, has said he is not going to Washington with a shopping list but has noted that offers of American military hardware were forcing an adjustment of Indian defence procurement policies.

 Gregory M. Suchan, deputy assistant secretary of state in the bureau of political and military affairs, met defence and external affairs ministry officials and is scheduled to meet representatives of industry as India-US defence cooperation widens from being buyer-seller arrangements to technology transfer and co-production. 

 Suchan had led a team to New Delhi on the invitation of the Indian government.

 Suchan said it was his purpose to de-mystify arms sales procedures and policy and he foresaw an increase in sales under the US governments Foreign Military Sales programme.

 Joshi sends Modi ball to Advani court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Till the other day, Murli Manohar Joshi was counted among L.K. Advanis prime detractors in the BJP. So when the dissidents, who were clamouring for Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis head, called on him in batches between yesterday and today, they hoped to find an instant sympathiser in Joshi. That was not to be.

 This afternoon, when former Gujarat chief minister Keshubhai Patel, the spearhead of the oust-Modi campaign, visited Joshi with Suresh Mehta, another ex-chief minister, and Surat MP Kashiram Rana, they were told to meet Advani. According to BJP sources, Joshi told Patel and the others that as Advani was the party president, he alone could solve their problems.

 Joshis response prompted the dissidents to revise their strategy of keeping Advani out of the loop. A Patel loyalist and a former legislator, Nalin Bhatt, said: Advani is our natural leader. There is no dissidence against him. Going by the party hierarchy, we will speak to everyone else and approach him last.

 Neither did Atal Bihari Vajpayee fan the anti-Modi sentiments although he had wanted him sacked shortly after the NDA lost the Lok Sabha elections in 2004. While Rana claimed that Vajpayees response was good, BJP sources said like Joshi, he advised the dissidents to speak with Advani.

 Political observers believe that Vajpayee and Joshis plan is they distance themselves from the mess in Gujarat, let Advani wallow in it and step in only if absolutely necessary.

 Advanis position on the matter, they said, was tenuous because he has lost the support of the Gujarat BJP and the RSS-VHP after the Jinnah controversy. The RSS-VHP is of the view that he should not contest from Gandhinagar again. Its a no-win situation for Advani. He only has Modi and his cronies for company, everyone else has virtually deserted him, said a state BJP MP.

 To go through the ritual of finding a resolution, Advani plans to call a meeting of his office-bearers on Saturday or Sunday. The Gujarat rebels had met practically all of them and barring Arun Jaitley, sources claimed the others ? especially Pramod Mahajan and M. Venkaiah Naidu ? felt Modi should not stay.

 In July 2004, Naidu (then the BJP president) was all set to ask Modi to step down. Had Vajpayee not made a public show of it, things would have gone according to his plan, the sources added.

 Patel, whom Advani might meet next week, and the others are upset with general secretary Om Prakash Mathur, the Gujarat prabhari (in-charge), for advocating disciplinary action against them. We have not violated any discipline. The party president alone can decide on that issue and not anybody else. The prabharis responsibility is to coordinate and take everyone with him and not take sides, Patel said.

 It is believed that Mathur will be told by Advani not to make any more statements.

 As a counter-offensive, Modi loyalists landed up in Delhi and called on Naidu and Mahajan. Bolstered by the support of four MPs ? Jayantilal Barot, Jayaben Thakkar, P.S. Gadhvi and Hari Patel ? they told the leaders that Modis record as chief minister was spectacular and he should be allowed to continue.

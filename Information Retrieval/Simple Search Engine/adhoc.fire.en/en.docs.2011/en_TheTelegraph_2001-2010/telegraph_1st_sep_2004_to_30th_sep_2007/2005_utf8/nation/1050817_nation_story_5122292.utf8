 Aussie jobs on offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: Want to work abroad and looking for a break? This could be your chance.

 Australia has launched a massive recruitment drive ? its biggest since the 1950s ? for skilled workers from across the world. Up for grabs are 20,000 jobs in various fields.

 The Australian government will be launching a series of expos, advertising the countrys culture and lifestyle, in London, Berlin, Amsterdam and Chennai.

 We are looking for skills from anywhere, immigration department spokesman Abdul Rizvi was quoted by the PTI from Sydney as having told the national radio.

 Rizvi said the focus was on fields like engineering, business, health and accounting. Though he did not mention information technology, sources said those with skills in this area can be recruited.

 Though no details of the potential work force has yet been spelt out, Canberra has indicated that migrants are selected on the basis of their skills, age, English-language ability and family relationship.

 The last probably means that those who have relatives already living in Australia might get preference provided they could manage sponsorship or references from them.

 Officials at the Australian high commission in Delhi were caught a little unawares by the immigration officials announcement. But they felt that the guidelines for potential workers would come from Canberra in the next few days.

 The recruitment drive is a clear indication that Australia is softening its strict immigration laws to meet the acute labour shortage.

 According to the PTI report, recent statistics show that Australia welcomed the highest number of immigrants in the year 2004-05. At present, of the 120,060 migrants who have been granted permanent resident status, around 65 per cent came through one of the many skill streams.

 Doctors lead the countrys most successful immigrant population, followed by accountants, nurses and trade workers.

 The current campaign is considered a sequel to the 1950s recruitment drive. The government had then recruited about one million migrants from Britain under assisted migration laws.

 If you think about what we did in the 1950s and the impact it had on Australia, well were doing it again, the immigration official was quoted as saying. 

 The present drive intends to fill specific job shortages.

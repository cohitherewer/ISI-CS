 Delhi push for twin medical body reforms

 R.VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, April 11: The Delhi Medical Council has inducted non-medical members into its disciplinary committee and has suggested that doctors should register themselves with the councils in every state they operate in.

 The inclusion of non-medical members ? the Bengal government is also actively considering such a proposal ?has been a long-standing demand of the Union ministry of consumer affairs. Many feel that such a step is essential to remove any perception of bias when the council acts as the arbiter in cases of medical negligence.

 In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court in response to a public interest litigation, the Delhi council said ?non-medical members have been included in the disciplinary committee?.

 The Union ministry had directed the Medical Council of India in 2000 to ask all state councils to include non-medical members. However, since the national council?s decisions are not binding on the state panels, few have taken such a step.

 According to the ministry?s directive, ?the ethics-cum-disciplinary committee of the medical council must have a majority of non-medical experts representing law, health administration, consumer affairs, nursing or pharmacy. Medical experts on the committee must be senior government doctors or private practitioners from outside the state?.

 The affidavit was filed on a notice the court issued after the health-activist organisation, People for Better Treatment, filed the PIL.

 Referring to another important issue, the Delhi council said in the affidavit that ?every doctor may be directed to register in the state medical council under whose jurisdiction he/she is practising. This will provide relief to the public, since registration is the basis of effective regulation?.

 This has been a big bone of contention with many state councils complaining that they cannot proceed against doctors when they register themselves in one place and treat patients elsewhere.

 ?In case a doctor is practising in more than one state, for instance a doctor working in Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon should be registered with the respective state medical council. This will ensure swift action against a delinquent medical practitioner,? the Delhi council?s petition said.

 Bengal has also mooted a proposal to get doctors from other states to register themselves with the state council.

 The hearing in the case will resume on April 15.

 Cong hesitates to touch Raj

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Raj Thackeray: Untested

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: After Narayan Rane and Sanjay Nirupam, is it Raj Thackerays turn to join the Congress? 

 No, thank you, said Maharashtra Congress sources. We would rather wait for the Shiv Sena to split and commit hara-kiri before taking in this heavyweight, said a senior state leader.

 Sena chief Bal Thackerays nephew (Rajs father is Thackerays brother and his mother is the late Mrs Thackerays sister) is engaged in a fratricidal battle for control of the regional party. But, Congress sources claimed, he has sent feelers to them and the NCP to consider taking him. 

 The sources said when Rane and Nirupam were inducted immediately after they left the Sena, the imperatives were different. First, had the Congress rejected them, they would have certainly joined the NCP. That would have been a huge morale booster for Sharad Pawar. The buzz would have been that the Congress is down-and-out, so nobody thinks it is an attractive option, a source said. 

 Second, Rane was tried, tested and trusted and was seen as a leader who could, at any point, ensure that he returned at least five legislators from his Konkan borough. 

 Ranes win in the Malwan Assembly bypoll also proved he could escape from the tigers (Thackerays) den and not only remain unscathed but vanquish the tiger.

 While the Congress rated Raj as politically and organisationally superior to Thackerays heir-anointed, Uddhav, the sources said he had never contested a poll nor campaigned actively. We are not sure if he can deliver the votes.

 Third, the party factored in the possibility of a Sena revival if it took Raj in. He will be seen as a traitor as the battle involves the Thackeray family and we will have to suffer the stigma as well. It could have the effect of consolidating the Sena cadre, said a source.

 In Mumbai today, chances of a patch-up between the cousins seemed remote despite the efforts of senior party leaders Manohar Joshi and Sanjay Raut, adds PTI.

 At Matoshree, Bal Thackeray was visited by almost all senior Sena leaders. We have spoken to both Balasaheb Thackeray and Uddhav on the issue of Raj. We are yet to arrive at a solution, Joshi said. 

 The party is understood to have taken the help of a senior BJP leader from Maharashtra. The former Union minister is reported to have had a telephone conversation with Raj but there was no official word on this.

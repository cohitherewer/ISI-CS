 Laloo kin accused of extortion 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 13: Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav?s nephew has landed himself in trouble with shopkeepers of a locality here accusing him of extortion.

 The matter came to light after the Patna inspector-general of police, Abhyanand, visited the Shastri Nagar area of the city yesterday where several shopkeepers complained that Krishna Yadav, a nephew of Laloo Prasad, had been forcibly collecting money from them for the past few months.

 A shopkeeper said Yadav used to collect the ?rangdaari? in the name of Patna Municipal Corporation and would hand over receipts of Rs 10.

 Police said Yadav appears to be the ?partner? of one Birendra Prasad, who has been awarded a Rs 6.17-lakh contract by the municipality for collecting toll from medium, small and petty shopkeepers.

 ?We have received a complaint against Krishna Yadav where he has been charged with collecting illegal fees,? said the deputy superintendent of police, Arshad Zaman.

 The police are yet to register an FIR against Yadav.

 and the police official said the matter was being investigated.

 ?Krishna Yadav forces us to part with money. Any shopkeeper who refuses to pay up is taken to task. We are living in constant fear,? a shopkeeper said.

 Nagendra Rai, another nephew of Laloo Prasad, had faced similar charges from shopkeepers of the locality. Rai had made no secret of his political ambitions but the RJD president did not pay much heed to his demand for being given a ticket for MLC.

 Police sources said the number of extortion cases has ?remarkably? come down in the capital after the imposition of central rule. ?This is the first complaint we have received after a long time. The number of ransom calls has also come down. I suspect that the lack of constant political patronage has a major role to play in this change,? a police official said.

 A resident of the adjoining Raja Bazar locality, however, said extortion was ?continuing as before? and the ?same names? were involved. ?The only difference now is that much of the operation is going on under cover. Unless the junior police officials and constables, who have built a network with the rangdaars, are transferred, we do not expect much change,? he added.

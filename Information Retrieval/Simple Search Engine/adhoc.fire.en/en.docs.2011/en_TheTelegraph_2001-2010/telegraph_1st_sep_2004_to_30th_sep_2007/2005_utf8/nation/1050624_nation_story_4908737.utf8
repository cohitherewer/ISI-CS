The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Iron Man bares fangs once again

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Lakhanpur, June 23: Once-bitten, BJP president L.K. Advani appears to be shying away from playing the dove ? at least on an occasion and a place close to the Sanghs heart.

 In his first rally after returning from Pakistan, Advani sounded like his old Iron Man self. The Agra summit failed because President Pervez Musharraf declined to accept the mayhem in Jammu and Kashmir as terrorism. 

 Instead, he termed the gory happenings as freedom struggle, the BJP chief said to cheers from a crowd of about 20,000, gathered for Shyama Prasad Mookerjees death anniversary.

 I had told Musharraf not to allow Pakistani territory for subversive acts against India. But he refused to budge and kept silent on the matter. That is why the talks failed. 

 It was a tone very different from that heard in the beginning of June, when Advani reached out to Pakistan with praise for Mohammed Ali Jinnah, regret over the Babri Masjid demolition and acceptance of Partition.

 The BJP chief nearly lost his job over these comments, with an angry Sangh parivar baying for his blood and the party unwilling to stand up for him. The RSS has now issued a list of dos and donts for Advani, which includes withdrawing all his statements and not speaking on secularism.

 At the rally today held at the spot 90 km south of Jammu where the Jan Sangh founder was arrested in 1953, the BJP chief appeared to be sticking to the script. 

 Mookerjee gave his life for one India. He fought against permits for entry of Indian citizens into Jammu and Kashmir and for abrogation of Article 370. He was arrested and died today 52 years ago in Srinagar. His was true sacrifice for the motherland, Advani said. The Jan Sangh leader had died in jail after his arrest for violating the permit rule.

 Advani, celebrated by the BJP as Iron Man before his fall from grace in Pakistan, said that like Mookerjee, he too would not allow Indian interests to be sacrificed. 

 Warning the UPA government against taking hasty steps to solve the Kashmir problem, Advani said terrorist camps still existed in Pakistan. We want peace but without sacrificing our interests. 

 Jinnah was not mentioned.

 Advani berated the Congress for pushing through Article 370, which grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

 I consider Article 370 a major blunder committed by Indias first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He made two blunders. One was granting special rights and the other was to approach the UN despite resistance by his own home minister Sardar Vallabbhai Patel. It was a historical blunder and has made the problem more complex. People should read about Patels role, he said, referring to his original hero.

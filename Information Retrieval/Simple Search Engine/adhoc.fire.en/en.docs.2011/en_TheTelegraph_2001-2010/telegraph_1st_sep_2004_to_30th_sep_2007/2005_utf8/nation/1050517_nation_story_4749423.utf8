 New Delhi, May 16: The CPM today fielded its new chief Prakash Karat to flash a report card scarred with red marks that underscored what the party felt were failures of the government.

 Listing a litany of complaints against the government after a two-day appraisal by the politburo, Karat said: The UPA government is obsessed with FDI? but many of the pro-poor commitments in the common minimum programme (CMP) have remained unfulfilled.

 The CPM handed out a catalogue of unfulfilled promises that outnumbered those that were kept. Overall, the UPA government has shown eagerness to push through measures which are in the interest of foreign capital and big business, it said. 

 The government is, however, reluctant to take up measures which can provide relief to and livelihood for tens of millions of farmers and workers, the party added.

 The four Left parties will meet tomorrow to formally decide whether or not to attend the UPA governments celebrations this Sunday. The mood is against joining the celebrations.

 Karat conceded that the UPA government has only spent just one year in office. The people are expecting them to fulfil their promises in the next one year, said the new CPM boss.

 Responding to a question, Karat said the government was not taking such good care of the Left as was being suggested. All they are doing is refrain from bringing to Parliament the bills we oppose, said Karat. Outside, they are going ahead with their reforms. 

 The UPA government has not brought two crucial bills the Left is opposing ? the insurance regulatory authority bill and the pension regulatory authority bill. The government runs the risk of having them defeated on the floor of the House if both BJP and Left oppose them. 

 Outside Parliament, however, the government has pushed through a decision to raise the foreign direct investment cap in telecommunications in the teeth of opposition from the Left. The cabinet could raise the FDI limit by an executive decision without requiring parliamentary sanction.

 The CPM feels the government will go ahead with reforms for which it does not need the Lefts support in the House. On the UPAs radar, there are several immediate policies that the Left is opposing. Banking reforms, FDI in retail and the electricity review act are some of them.

 Karat repeated the CPMs threat of taking the struggle against anti-poor policies to the streets. In the coming days, the CPM will step up mass mobilisation and movements to ensure the implementation of the common minimum programme, he said.

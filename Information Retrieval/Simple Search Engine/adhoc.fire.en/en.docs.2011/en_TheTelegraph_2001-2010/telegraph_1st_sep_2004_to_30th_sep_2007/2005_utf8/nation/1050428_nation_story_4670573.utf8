 IAF to probe abuse charge

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, April 27: The IAF announced a court of inquiry into charges of sexual harassment against three senior officers on a day when flying officer Anjali Gupta told a general court martial (GCM) that she had no faith in it. 

 An IAF spokesperson said today the court of inquiry, headed by an air vice marshal, will commence its probe on May 2. Two of its four members will be women officers of the air strike wing.

 At the GCM, a frail, bespectacled Gupta said on the first day of the hearing at the Aircraft Systems and Testing Establishment: ?Justice in this command (Training Command) and with this court cannot prevail.?

 She complained of attempts to silence her over the last 15 months and how the authorities neither appointed a defending officer of her choice from the force nor allowed her to meet a civil lawyer. 

 The court?s presiding officer, Group Captain V. Ganesh, warned Gupta that such statements would amount to contempt of court and a prison term of three years.

 The 30-year-old flying officer is being tried on six charges, including financial irregularities and indiscipline.

 Gupta?s mother Uma and brother-in-law Jitender Garg said they would like a civil court to hear the case. ?They won?t help her in any way. She must come home (Delhi) for a month and meet a legal expert who can defend her.?

 The flying officer today turned down summons from a local police station to turn up tomorrow in connection with her harassment complaint on the ground that it had earlier refused to act on it.

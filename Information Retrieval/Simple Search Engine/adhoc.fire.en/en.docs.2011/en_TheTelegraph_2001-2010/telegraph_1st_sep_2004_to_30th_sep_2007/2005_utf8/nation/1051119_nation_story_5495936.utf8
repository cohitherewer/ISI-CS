 Sania steers clear of premarital sex row

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Sania: Safety first

 Hyderabad, Nov. 18: As Hindu and Muslim fundamentalists burnt her effigies across Andhra Pradesh, Sania Mirza today denied that she had ever advocated premarital sex.

 I would like to clearly say on record that I could not possibly justify premarital sex as it is a big sin in Islam and one which I believe will not be forgiven by Allah, the tennis queen said in a long statement.

 Zealots have accused the 19-year-old of defending Tamil actor Kushboos reported remark that it was all right for women to have sex before marriage so long as they took precautions against disease and pregnancy.

 But when she was asked about the Kushboo controversy at a function in Delhi on Wednesday, the teenage sensation had quickly spotted the spin.

 So there are two issues here ? safe sex and sex before marriage, she had said. She then chose to comment basically on the first issue: You dont want me to tell you that you have to have safe sex, whether it is before or after marriage. Everyone must know what he or she is doing.

 This was taken by many to be an endorsement of premarital sex. Sania has brought shame to Indian society. Police should arrest her for advocating premarital sex, said Vijay Kumar, Visakhapatnam unit chief of Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the BJPs student wing.

 In Chhattisgarhs Raipur, Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Acharya Dharmendra, too, fired a salvo: I am an ardent fan of Sania. But she is trying to destroy institutions like marriage and other social institutions by saying certain things that are beyond imagination.

 The reaction of the Islamic clergy in Hyderabad was no less strident. A devout Muslim man or woman cannot even mingle freely (with the opposite sex) before wedding, leave alone having sex, said Moulana Haseebul Hasan Siddiqui, the general secretary of the Sunni ulema board here. If a Muslim promotes fornication, he or she may be excommunicated.

 Siddiqui defended the wave of protests as a natural reaction to such an outrageous stand (on Sanias part).

 Sanias statement said she had been misquoted in a section of the media, which read in her remarks totally false connotations of my justifying premarital sex. She said she was deeply pained at the attempt to malign my image and converting a non-issue into a serious controversy.

 Sania, who has taken to wearing full-sleeve shirts and trousers at her public appearances, had, however, taken a pot shot at critics of her short skirts. As long as I keep winning, people should not bother whether the length of my skirt was six inches or six feet.

 Formula 1 driver Narain Karthikeyan, who was at the function with Sania, had spoken far stronger words in Kushboos support. South India is a closed society. There was nothing wrong in what she (Kushboo) said. It has spiralled into a big issue unfortunately.

 After Sanias clarification, Islamic activists dropped their plans to burn her effigies after the Friday prayers. 

 Those close to Sania said the reports of criminal cases being filed against Tamil actress Suhasini Manirathnam for supporting Kushboo were one reason why Sania had issued the clarification.

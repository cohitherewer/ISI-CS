 Israeli tourist found in lodge

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 4: A government desperate to show the world that no tourist, foreign or domestic, had perished in the killer waves, finally caught up with a former Israeli conscript who was missing from here since December 25.

 Ditza Israeli, 25, was traced this morning to a lodge at the beach resort of Bakel in Kerala?s northern district of Kasargod, where she was found along with Farooq Ahmed of Jammu and Kashmir.

 Ditza told Kanhangad deputy superintendent of police Habeeb Rahman that she never expected her private jaunt to cause such a media upheaval.

 Asked why she suddenly broke off email contact with her parents, Ditza said she never gauged the seriousness of the situation until she read in the morning papers about the extent of the tsunami havoc.

 Deputy inspector-general of police Arun Kumar Sinha told The Telegraph that the woman travelled north, reaching Kollam on December 25, Alappuzha and Kochi on December 26, and Bakel the next day. She had arrived in Kerala on December 22.

 Ditza?s vanishing act had sent police into a tizzy. Israeli special ambassador Amikam Levy had also joined the search efforts.

 The state government was a little concerned, especially after Levy told the local media that he did not rule out the possibility that his compatriot might have been caught in the waves either at the beach resort of Kovalam or at Kanyakumari.

 The envoy has faxed a thanks message to the state police chief on learning that the woman has been found.

 Sinha said Ditza had been to a beautician?s at Varkala, some 40 km south of Thiruvananthapuram, before disappearing. She had told the beautician that she planned to visit either Kovalam or Kanyakumari. The police scoured all hotels and lodges at probable locations, only to find that she had left no trail. 

 At the Varkala hotel, she had not signed the ?C? form containing travel details, mandatory for all foreign visitors.

 Asked about the significance of the special ambassador?s visit, a government official said Ditza must be highly connected. She had a dual passport and was here on an American visa. Her father, Derry Israeli, is a businessman in the US.

 While Ditza may now return without hassles, the hotels that hosted her without proper papers would have to face the law.

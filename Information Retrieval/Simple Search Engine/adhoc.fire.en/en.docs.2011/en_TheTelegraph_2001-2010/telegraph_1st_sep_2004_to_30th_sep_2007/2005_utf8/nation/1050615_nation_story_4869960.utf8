 11 Dalits killed in UP village blaze

 Lucknow: Eleven Dalits, including eight children and a pregnant woman, were burnt alive when a raging fire on Tuesday engulfed their village in Lakhimpur-Kheri district, about 89 km from here, reports our special correspondent.

 The fire broke out when a woman was lighting some dry wood to cook a meal. The fire, which spread from one house in Sujan Tanda village under Veera police station area, soon engulfed other huts.

 Altogether 54 huts, most of them made of straw and dry wood, were completely gutted. Two other women and six goats kept in a hut were also killed in the blaze.

 Uttar Pradesh principal secretary, home, Aloke Sinha said the fire had broken out around 3 in the afternoon when the men were away at work. He added that the village belonged to landless labourers.

 Fire brigade personnel ? the station is about 40 km from the village ? arrived after it was all over, said a district official.

 What seemed to have added to the woe of the villagers was the dry gusty wind and a heat wave sweeping the area. The small fire was helped by the wind to spread fast, said another official.

 Novel scheme to go green

 The NGO, Parisara, and the state government have formed a committee to take up the project.

 The panel has proposed planting saplings on a 300-acre land ? which belongs to the state-run Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board ? in and around the catchment areas of the Tippagondanahalli on the outskirts of the city.

 Fifty saplings will be grown on each acre, Eshwar Prasad of the NGO, said. Additional chief secretary Vijay Gore was among the first to pay Rs 500.

 Each tree will be numbered and a certificate with all the details will be issued to individuals.

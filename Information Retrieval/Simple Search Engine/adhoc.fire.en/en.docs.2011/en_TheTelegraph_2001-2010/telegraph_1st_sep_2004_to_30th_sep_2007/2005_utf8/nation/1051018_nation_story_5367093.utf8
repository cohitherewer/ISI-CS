The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Curtain goes up on road drama

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Thumbs down

 Madurai, Oct. 17: The next 

 time a Vellaiyampatti residents bullock cart gets 

 stuck on a slushy village path, he might just shrug and 

 mutter to himself lifes a drama anyway?.

 The village, 25 km from Madurai town, has just vetoed the panchayat chiefs call for a pucca road so that the money can be better spent in building a dais for staging plays.

 Last month, the Jayalalithaa government had announced an additional Rs 400 crore for building and upgrading village roads ? part of a package of sops in a pre-poll year.

 At first, the gram sabha in Vellaiyampatti had taken the beaten track, plumping for a road under the new Namadhu Gramam (our village) development scheme.

 But the villagers were quick to change their mind, deciding life was one big party and the thing they needed most was to watch their annual play on a concrete dais, protected by a sliding roof. They didnt need the Rs 3 lakh a plan for a road might have brought them; just Rs 1 lakh for their drama stage would be enough.

 Panchayat chief M. Irulandi is livid. He says the local MLA, who is from the ADMK, prevailed over the villagers to take a foolish decision.

 People who first voted for the road quickly changed their mind and, under the MLAs influence, began demanding a theatre stage as our neighbouring village has one, too, he said.

 We may use the dais just once a year, but we need a road urgently. Yet I had to give in, Irulandi sighed.

 The MLA, V.R. Rajangam, who represents the Sholavandan constituency within which Vellaiyampatti falls, is unabashed.

 I had suggested a stage because that is what most people in the village want, he told The Telegraph over the phone. Its under construction and will be completed soon.

 If the people really preferred a stage, why did the gram sabha first vote for a road? The MLA evaded a direct answer, saying a stage has several uses for the people.

 See, they will enjoy their annual folk plays, like Harichandra Natak, more if they watch it staged on a pucca dais, he said. The stage is a minimal structure in concrete, to be covered with a sliding concrete roof.

 At other times, he suggested, if the villagers wish to watch films of MGR, Shivaji Ganesan or Rajnikant, they can place a portable screen on the dais.

 The dais thus fulfils a larger entertainment purpose, the MLA said. It can also serve a social purpose: marriages can be conducted there.

 There are many villages in his constituency, Rajangam said, that are dying to have a drama stage of their own. The fact, however, is that few of them are ready to trade a road for one, and have chosen to use government funds to improve the more mundane aspects of their life.

 Under the Namadhu Gramam scheme, every village panchayat gets an extra Rs 3 lakh every year to improve basic infrastructure.

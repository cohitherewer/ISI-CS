 Bhubaneswar, March 31: Women in Orissa continue to cope with violence in different forms ? both in the private and public spheres.

 While making notes on the incidence of violence, the first human development report of the state ? released last Thursday ? also showed that the state has not attached adequate importance to issues like women?s health.

 Quoting the National Family Health Survey-2, the report states that at least two out of seven married women in Orissa have experienced domestic violence since the age of 15 years and at least one out of eight has faced the same in the past 12 months.

 On most occasions, women are abused at home on the grounds of disrespecting in-laws, suspicion of infidelity and going out without informing the husband. Rape is a major form of non-domestic violence against women while eve-teasing and sexual harassment at the workplace are also common in the state.

 Violence on women had been on the constant rise in the Nineties, with the period between 1993 and 1996 throwing up alarming figures. Among the various forms of violence against women, the percentage of molestation (35.23) was the highest, followed by dowry-related abuse (25.37).

 While the incidence of dowry-related deaths was low in the tribal regions of the state, the same could not be said of the coastal district, the report said. More than 90 per cent of the dowry deaths occurred in joint-family settings, it added. 

 Dowry-induced violence manifested itself in the form of female foeticide and infanticide as well. The report also noted that there had been an increase in dowry-related deaths despite the enactment of the Dowry Prohibition Act in 1991.

 The report observed that successive governments in Orissa have cut their budgetary allocation for women?s schemes. The low level of resource allocation for such programmes showed that gender sensitivity was yet to significantly influence budgetary considerations in the state. 

 The report further noted that budgetary allocation in recent years for the departments of women and child development and health and family welfare did not present a positive picture.

 According to the report, 48 per cent of the women in the state suffered from nutritional deficiency. In the case of illiterate women, the figure was an alarming 54.6 per cent. About 55.5 per cent of Scheduled Tribe women and 55.2 per cent of those with a low standard of living faced the problem of malnutrition.

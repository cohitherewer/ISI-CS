 Indians in infotech drivers seat in Britain

 AMIT ROY

 Bridging the digital divide

 London, Nov. 20: The overwhelming majority of foreign IT workers coming into Britain to meet a skills shortage in this country are from India because they are said to be the best in the world, it will be disclosed in a report to be published tomorrow.

 Out of the 22,000 foreign information technology engineers recruited to fill vacancies in Britain over the past year, eight out of 10 came from India, a report published by the Association of Technology Staffing Companies will state.

 Ann Swain, the associations chief executive, commented: The transfer of jobs between the UK and India is now very much a two-way traffic. The irony is that while low-skilled IT jobs continue to be shipped to India, highly skilled Indian IT professionals are coming to the UK to take up managerial roles.

 The association says its report reveals the true extent of Britains dependence on foreign IT workers. Some analysts suggest that multinational companies are hiring staff in low-cost countries and transferring them to high-cost markets.

 But this explanation appears not to be valid, at least for India, where there is apparently less desire among middle-class engineers and scientists to go abroad to better themselves. If they can earn good money in India, many would rather stay at home, it is being claimed.

 Well-known British IT analyst, Mark Kobayashi-Hillary, author of the best-selling Outsourcing to India, told The Telegraph today: People are considering they dont have to go abroad. India and China are where its all happening.

 Tomorrows report will come as a rude shock to British trade unions who have consistently tried to discourage outsourcing by arguing Indian IT workers and call centres simply cannot do the jobs as well as they can be done in the UK. Now, it is being revealed that since the UK is not producing enough good IT engineers at home, it has to raid India for highly qualified staff.

 This has not yet reached the proportions of a brain drain from India, though, said Kobayashi-Hillary. There seem to be enough people in India, with new graduates coming on to the market. But Britain has to worry about what will happen here in the next 20 to 30 years.

 In British academic circles, there are mounting worries that fewer and fewer young people are taking up maths, physics and engineering at A level and at university, and turning instead to soft options such as media studies.

 Kobayashi-Hillary, who is also global director, Commonwealth Business Council Technologies, said Indians who came to Britain to fill jobs in middle management were being paid at British rates. Someone in middle management would expect to get ?50,000 a year. British companies could go elsewhere to get cheaper workers.

 He agreed that workers who came on short-term contracts could save substantial sums.

 Other figures tell substantially the same story.

 Over 30,000 UK IT work permits have been granted to foreign computer experts within the last year-and-a-half, according to data obtained by Contractor UK under the Freedom of Information Act.

 More than 80 per cent of the 30,090 permits approved between January 2004 and June 2005 went to Indian computer experts, coming to the UK as software engineers, system analysts and in other IT-related posts.

 It seems that Indian staff are better than their counterparts from the US, which also depends on the flow from India. 

 The total of 24,764 Indian nationals arriving in the UK is many times the second-highest number of entrants ? 1,700 ? who originated from the US.

 Kobayashi-Hillary emphasised the reason why India was being targeted by British companies: India is now the pre-eminent source of IT expertise in the world.

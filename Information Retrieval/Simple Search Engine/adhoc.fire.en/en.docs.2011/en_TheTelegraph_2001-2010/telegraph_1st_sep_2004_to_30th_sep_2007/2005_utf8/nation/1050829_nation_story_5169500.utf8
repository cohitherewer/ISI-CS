The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Champ coolie in dire straits

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 28: P. Suresh, who was today crowned the strongman of India in powerlifting, lives in such penury that he may soon have to quit the sport.

 I am glad to receive this title in my home state and at a venue that is just 25 km from my village, Chelanoor, said the quarry worker when the announcement was made at the close of the Senior National Powerlifting Championship at the V.K. Krishna Menon stadium in Kozhikode this evening.

 The 29-year-old notched up three records in the 52-kg class at the start of the championship on August 24 ? in squat and bench press and in the total.

 However, the strongmans chances of participating in the Commonwealth Powerlifting Championship in London are bleak. 

 The powerlifter told The Telegraph over phone from Kozhikode that he has not been able to raise the Rs 81,000 required for registration and travel.

 How can a coolie, who earns Rs 160 a day on an average, hope to raise this amount? Besides, I support my parents and two brothers, who are unemployed, said Suresh.

 The youth once sold land to attend an event, but that was a once-a-lifetime option.

 Sureshs next big hope is the World Championship in November, but he is not sure whether he will make it to the meet, despite earnest efforts by well-wishers.

 Suresh has great potential, said coach K. Sreenath at the Panicker Road Young Stars Multi-Gymnasium, where the champion practises.

 His own rigorous regime of cutting, lifting and loading stones at the quarry, almost every day, strengthens his prowess. His hands and shoulders are like steel, Sreenath said. 

 Powerlifting calls for intensive training and high- calorie nourishment for the trainee. Track suits are expensive. 

 The Kodankandath International Arts Foundation and the local club have been contributing nearly Rs 4,000 every month to sustain Sureshs training, Sureshs coach said.

 Suresh dares not think about marriage. If he misses a days wages, his family misses a meal. Obviously, he doesnt want to add another hungry mouth to feed.

 The powerlifters efforts to get a government job have been in vain. 

 The Kerala government last year decided that only sportspersons in events listed in Olympics be considered for jobs.

 All my hope now rests on M.P. Veerendra Kumar, MP, who has agreed to take up my case for a job with railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, said Suresh, who feels that time is running out.

 Abuse finger at RNA

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 1: Nepal?s security forces are responsible for a widespread pattern of enforced disappearances of people, a report released today by the US-based monitor, the Human Rights Watch, said.

 The Royal Nepal Army (RNA) is one of the world?s worst perpetrators of enforced disappearances. More than 1,200 cases have been documented in the last five years, the report, Clear Culpability: Disappearances by security forces in Nepal, said.

 ?There is very little information coming from outside the towns (since King Gyanendra?s February 1 coup). The army is completely unaccountable and the RNA has established itself as a major human rights violator,? said Sam Zarifi, the organisation?s deputy director for Asia, who was here after a survey of the situation in Nepal.

 The Human Rights Watch has said the international community should act immediately to prevent a deepening of the ?disappearances? crisis in the wake of the royal takeover. 

 It has urged the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to adopt a resolution at its upcoming session condemning abuses by both sides of the conflict. The rights body also urged the appointment of a special rapporteur to monitor the human rights situation in Nepal.

 ?Maoist forces have a horrendous record of killings, torture and intimidation, but the response can?t be to unleash an army that has been responsible for so many ?disappearances? and other egregious human rights abuses,? Brad Adams, the organisation?s director for Asia, said in a release.

 Zarifi, who visited Kathmandu and Nepalgunj, said it was important for international powers to snap links with the RNA. 

 ?The point of our report is that this (the RNA) is not an army that the outside world should be linked to. India has taken a principled stand by stopping military supplies. As a responsible power in South Asia, it cannot afford to have such a situation in what is its backyard,? he said.

 Among the places of detention recorded in the report are army establishments where the ?disappeared? persons were last seen alive.

 These are Bhairabnath Gulm (Maharajgunj) army barracks (Kathmandu), Chhauni (Jagadal), Balazu police station and Balazu army camp (Kathmandu), Shorakutte police station (Kathmandu), Farping army camp (Kathmandu), Fulbari army barracks (Kaski), Bijayapur army barracks (Kaski), Pokhara police post (Kaski), Bharatpur police post (Chitwan), Rajdal army barracks (Lalitpur), Suryabinayak army barracks in Bhaktapur (Kavre) and at least 12 other establishments.

 Schoolboys? return raises eyebrows

 Patna/Ranchi, Feb. 2: Kislay Kaushal, the schoolboy who was kidnapped a fortnight ago, was freed today, a day before the first round of Assembly elections in Bihar. So were Dipak Bharti from Bhagalpur and Anjali Kumari from Hajipur, both abducted last month.

 Questions are, however, being raised about the rescue of the three children as political parties kicked and screamed as they got ready for the poll.

 In Bihar, the question was whether the ?rescue? or ?return? of two abducted boys, to their homes in Patna and Bhagalpur, would benefit the ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal. In Jharkhand, the worry was how peaceful the polling would turn out to be.

 RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav did go on the offensive, alleging that the cellphone used by abductors belonged to ?a BJP guy? and that the abductors belonged to the Chunnu Thakur gang with close links to Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party. 

 The kidnapping was a conspiracy hatched by the Opposition to discredit the state, he alleged. The fuming Opposition retaliated in kind. 

 Paswan threatened to sue Laloo Prasad, asking: ?Who is Chunnu Thakur? He has no links with our party?? both in the same breath. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi of the BJP alleged that ?Laloo Yadav certainly knows when to get children kidnapped and when to get them released for political gains.? Sushil Modi even alleged that the chief minister?s brothers, Sadhu and Subhash Yadav, had secured the release of the boy after paying a ransom of Rs 10 lakh.

 In both Bihar and Jharkhand, meanwhile, officials kept their fingers crossed for fireworks on the polling day. Most of the constituencies going to the polls tomorrow fall in areas deemed to be Naxalite strongholds. Recovery of landmines and bombs on poll-eve, renewed threats of violence and calls for boycotting the poll have cast a shadow on the election. 

 Unprecedented security measures and concentration of all resources in the Naxalite-infested areas in one go, officials hope, would do the trick on Thursday in keeping the polling high and violence on the lower side.

 The UPA goes to the polls in both states as a divided house. The allies will be pitted against each other in as many as 57 constituencies tomorrow and practically everywhere in Jharkhand. 

 The stake of the RJD is the highest in Bihar as the party had won 33 of these 64 constituencies in Bihar last time. Janata Dal (United) had then won 12 and Congress just one. The split in the UPA is so sharp that there are constituencies where Congress and LJP candidates are also pitted against one another despite the alliance they supposedly have.

 In Jharkhand, the polling tomorrow will decide the fate of four ministers and 12 MLAs. Five choppers have been kept on stand-by, four of them from the air force. 

 The return of the abducted children, however, raised several eyebrows. Speaking to a television channel in the morning, Kislay, a Class IX student of DPS, Patna, claimed that he was confined to a room for 15 days and this morning, around 9 am, the door was opened by the police who rescued him.

 The police, however, claimed that the abductors released the boy early in the morning and he reached the highway near Sipara, on the outskirts of Patna, on his own.

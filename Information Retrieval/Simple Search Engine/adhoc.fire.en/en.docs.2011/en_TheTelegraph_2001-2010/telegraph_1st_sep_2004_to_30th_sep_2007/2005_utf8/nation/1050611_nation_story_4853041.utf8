 Lanka deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Colombo, June 10: Sri Lanka today agreed to accept an air radar defence system from India amid reports that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam had secretly built two airstrips in Jaffna and acquired several warplanes.

 Yes, this (the radar system) is very much under discussion and we will certainly accept it, Sri Lankan foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar told reporters after a meeting with Indian external affairs minister Natwar Singh. We are looking at ways and means on how this can be done.

 Though the two countries have been discussing air defence for a while, Colombo had never acknowledged it in public before. One reason could be that an admission might shut the door on a diplomatic resolution of the issue.

 Both India and Sri Lanka, however, are still thinking of using the Norwegian mediators to find a solution, sources said. The Tamil Tigers have till now have not allowed anyone, including the western observers, to inspect the alleged sites of the airstrips.

 That India and Sri Lanka are worried was evident from their recent talks and the joint statement issued after President Chandrika Kumaratungas visit to Delhi last week. 

 Concern was expressed over ceasefire violations. Particular concern was expressed over the illegal acquisition of air capability, the joint statement said.

 Apart from the air defence system, the two countries are also working on a defence co-operation agreement. 

 India and Sri Lanka have extensive co-operation in the defence field. A defence co-operation agreement is in the process of being finalised, Natwar Singh said.

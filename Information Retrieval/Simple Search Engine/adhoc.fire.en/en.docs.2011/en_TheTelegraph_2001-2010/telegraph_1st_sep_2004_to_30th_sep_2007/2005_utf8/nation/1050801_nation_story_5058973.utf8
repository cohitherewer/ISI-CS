 Orissa rivers in spate

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, July 31: As Mumbaikars braced for another round of flood, Orissa found itself in the midst of one.

 Continuous rain since Thursday night, rapid rise in the water level in all major rivers and a deep depression in the Bay of Bengal has unleashed a deadly cocktail of natural forces for the state.

 Nearly 5 lakh people in Jajpur district of Orissa have been affected as the river Brahmani, its tributary, and the river Baitarani inundated vast areas, claiming three lives in the state, said revenue secretary Tarunkanti Mishra.

 At least seven out of 10 blocks in Jajpur district have been affected in the floods triggered by the swollen Brahmani, its tributary Kharashrota and the Baitarani. 

 A population of 6.22 lakh spread over 600 villages in 123 gram panchayats have been marooned while 63,336 hectares of paddy land had been submerged and over 800 kutcha houses damaged in the floods, sources said.

 The Brahmani and Baitarani had been flowing above their danger mark while the Mahanadi was also rising. Brahmani was flowing at 23.22 metres against the danger level of 23 metres at Jenapur while the Baitarani, which had flooded vast areas of Jajpur and Bhadrak districts a month ago, was flowing at 18.67 metres against the red mark of 17.83 metres at Akhuapada.

 While Jajpur braced with flood, floodwater inundated Bhadrak district for the second time in the last fortnight. Dhamnagar and Tihidi blocks of Bhadrak have been the worst affected. 

 In Dhamnagar, six breaches have were reported. Thirty gram panchayats in the block have been under water. Transport and traffic movement along Bhadrak-Chandbali Road and Bhadrak-Aradi Road have been badly affected as floodwater swept through the roads.

 The deep depression over northwest Bay of Bengal of the Orissa coast remained stationary and lay centred close to Keonjhar. Heavy to very heavy rains are likely to occur at places over Orissa during the next 24 hours.

 The weather officials have sounded a heavy rainfall warning (50 mm or more) at isolated places over all the catchments except Subarnarekha, Budhabalanga, Vamsadhara and Rushikulya catchments during the next 48 hours.

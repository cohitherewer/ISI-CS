 Consumer cover on rail hospitals

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has 

 ruled that railway hospitals providing free treatment to 

 its employees are liable for deficient service under the 

 consumer protection act.

 A bench of Justices Ruma Pal and C.K. Thakker also set aside a concurring order of a state consumer forum and the National Consumer Disputed Redressal Commission holding that as the services were rendered free of cost, it could not fall within the purview of the consumer protection act.

 A railway employee, I.T. Kotgiri, accused the Central Railway-run B.R. Ambedkar hospital of negligence leading to his wife?s death and claimed compensation under the act.

 The apex court said where medical service was rendered as part of the terms and conditions of service, it would not amount to free service and would constitute service for a cosideration, bringing the hospital under the purview of the consumer protection act.

 The bench said there was no dispute that the treatment in the railway hospital was given to the appellant and his family members as part of the conditions of his service .

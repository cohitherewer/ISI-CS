 Family at Buta door for death relief

 Patna, April 5: Poverty-struck parents, husband and son of 30-year-old Kanchan have appealed to Governor Buta Singh to allow mercy killing of the woman, comatose for the past five-and-a- half years.

 Kanchan slipped into coma after an unsuccessful pregnancy and her family members alleged that negligence on the part of doctors attending on her was responsible for her condition. 

 The family had earlier filed a petition in Patna High Court but it was turned down on the grounds that the law did not permit such action and any permission would not have the woman?s consent.

 Ibrahim Kabir, the lawyer who has taken up the woman?s case, said the material condition in the state has changed with the imposition of President?s rule and the governor has the power to promulgate ordinances. 

 ?It is a special case under special circumstances. The governor should take this fact into account while deciding on the appeal,? the lawyer said. 

 Mercy killings are not permissible under Indian law but countries like Holland and Belgium provide such a right. In their petition to the governor, the woman?s family has cited the recent case in which a Florida court allowed the life of Terri Schiavo, a woman who had been in coma for 15 years, to be ended by withdrawing her life support systems.

 Kanchan, whose husband Tarkeshwar Chandravanshi runs a small betel shop to earn a living, has been lying immobile and her family has to feed liquid diet to her.

 Her father Baiju Ram is unemployed while her mother Lakshmi Devi works as a maidservant. The family lives in a slum in the Shastri Nagar locality of the capital.

 ?My daughter is dying a hundred deaths every day. She is helpless and cannot move on her own. She is almost unconscious. We love her very much and it is with great pain that we have sent this appeal to the governor. We want our daughter to be relieved of the pain,? Baiju Ram said.

 Kabir said mercy killing is tantamount to murder under the present law. ?But it is time a healthy debate started on the matter. The court rejected the petition because her consent cannot be taken,? he added.

 ?I feel private mercy killings are openly taking place in society. What do you make of a doctor?s suggestion to a family to treat an elderly well during his or her last days? It may sound harsh but it is like saying that a person has reached his last stage. What if the family of a person in coma stops feeding him? The person will obviously die,? the lawyer said.

 ?A new law needs to be formulated on this issue after a healthy debate. A timeframe needs to be fixed as to after what period mercy deaths can be allowed. This will be doing justice to the comatose person who dies everyday and the family has to bear untold hardship,? Kabir said. 

 Kanchan?s husband said doctors have given up all hopes of her revival. ?There can be other families like us. I can understand their miseries. This issue needs to be addressed and we expect the governor to take a favourable and humane position in this case. We cannot run away from the truth and social realities for ever,? he added.

 A similar permission sought for an Andhra Pradesh youth, Venkatesh, by her mother had been denied a few months ago. The youth died while the issue was being debated.

 Baglihar

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: Indias case with the controversial Baglihar hydro-electric project on the Chenab river is in for a tough test next month after continuous rain and landslides have choked its tunnels and raised fears from Pakistan about its impact, reports our special correspondent.

 A diversion tunnel was blocked on Sunday night, prompting engineers and technicians working on the project into an inconclusive brainstorming session to get it back on the rails before the World Bank-appointed expert visits it around the last week of September.

 According to information available in Delhi, six of the dams 18 blocks are choked. In mid-July, another diversion tunnel was blocked. Official sources said there was no threat to the 73-metre-high dam but there were reports that water could be flowing over it. 

 The project is due for commissioning in the middle of 2006 in spite of the dispute raised by Pakistan that says the dam blocks the Chenabs flow.

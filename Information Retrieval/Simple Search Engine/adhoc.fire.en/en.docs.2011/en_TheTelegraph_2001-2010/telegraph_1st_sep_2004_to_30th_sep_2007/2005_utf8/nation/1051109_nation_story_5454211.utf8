The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Netaji report

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: The Mukherjee commission, which probed Netaji Subhas Chandra Boses mysterious disappearance, today submitted its report to the Centre. It is likely to be tabled in Parliaments winter session.

 Netajis nephew Subrata Bose, who was involved in the investigations and depositions before the commission, told The Telegraph: Taiwans government has denied any air crash taking place on August 18, 1945, and I think it will be reflected in the commissions report. But then it automatically gives birth to another question ? what happened next? It would be interesting to know what the report says.

 Hopes of a breakthrough into Netajis disappearance were belied when Justice Mukherjee returned almost empty-handed from Russia last month saying the commission had not found any relevant material. But Subrata Bose thinks diplomatic help by the government could have helped access KGB archives and brought out interesting facts.

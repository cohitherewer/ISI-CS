 BJP conclave at Bihar altar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, August 12: The Bihar polls may put off the BJPs national executive for the second time.

 BJP sources said the partys feedback is that the elections could take place in early October ? or the middle of the month at the latest ? before the season of festivals begins.

 We will have to plunge into poll preparations right after the monsoon session of Parliament (which ends on August 26) and will have to forget the Chennai conclave, a BJP leader said.

 The executive was to be held on September 16-18 after it was deferred last month following the spat between party president L.K. Advani and the RSS. The Sangh, which feared that Advani might use the gathering to show off his strength, wanted the postponement.

 The BJP views the Bihar election as extraordinarily significant for the party and the NDA for two reasons. One, it may help Advani strengthen his position and allow him to complete his term as party chief. Two, it may restore the Opposition alliances status as a viable alternative to the ruling United Progressive Alliance.

 All three members of the Election Commission will be in Patna on August 24-25 to meet representatives of political parties as well as senior civil and police officials. The BJP expects the poll dates to be announced soon after that.

 Party sources said they believe the elections will be held before the festival season begins in the middle of October with Dussehra, followed by Diwali and Chhat Puja.

 Coinciding with Chhat is Ramzan, which will extend through November. Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan, has already told the poll commission that elections should not be held in November because of Ramzan.

 In December, Parliament will meet for the winter session. After that, elections are possible only in January or February before the budget session begins.

 The commission had earlier indicated that the polls may be held towards the end of November. The explanation was that Bihar could be in the grip of floods till September-end, which would make it tough logistically to revise the electoral rolls and issue voter identity cards.

 BJP sources admitted that their expectation of an early election in Bihar may have been influenced by the belief that this would favour the Opposition alliance rather than Laloo Prasad Yadav and the Congress coalition.

 They claimed the nyay yatra launched by Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar has been a huge success. A senior leader from Paswans party backed the claim, saying: Earlier, barely 500 people would come and listen to Nitish. Today, some 10,000 show up at every meeting he holds.

 Even Laloo Prasad has reportedly told his confidants that turnouts at rallies do not indicate voter support -- a sign that he is nervous and defensive.

 While the BJP-Dal (United) alliance is intact, the United Progressive Alliance is still assailed by doubts about Paswan.

 The Lok Janshakti Party boss is looking at a third formation that will include his party, CPI and CPI(M-L), all of which are anti-Laloo Prasad. Sources close to him said that right now, his only aim is to ensure that Laloo Prasad is pushed to third place.

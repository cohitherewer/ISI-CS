 After CD, sadhus fall off pedestal

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 19: Revered yesterday, loathed today.

 Stunned followers of the Vadtal Swaminarayan sect in Gujarat now feel ashamed of the ?holy men? they had venerated so long after a local channel showed some of them in sexual acts with women.

 Some are so hurt they do not even want to talk about the CDs that have led to the arrest of a sadhu of the Junagadh Swaminarayan temple and three touts who arranged for women to be taken in and videographed them having sex. The CDs were being sold in the market.

 Devotees say the impact of the scandal ? believed to be a result of the bitter rivalry between two factions of the sect ? is palpable. ?Now we can clearly see a low turnout in our regular satsang and religious activities,? says Dr Rajshree Swaminarayan, a follower.

 Rajshree?s faith has not been shaken but, like Shardaben, another follower from Dholaka town near Ahmedabad, she feels ?no one should give money to these sadhus? and devotees should stop attending functions presided over by these swamis.

 The sadhus, she says, could be trapped only because they were morally weak and corrupt. Sadhus of the Swaminarayan sect are supposed to keep a distance from women.

 But Natubhai Patel, a die-hard optimist, is sure the followers will shake off the taint. ?They will forget everything, just like the murder of a swami in 1997? which, he says, ?nobody? remembers today, even though five sadhus of this sect were sentenced to life imprisonment last year.

 Devotees like Patel stress on what they claim is the scandal?s ?positive side?. They believe the ?dirt and the rot that had set in is getting cleared? and the followers only need to unite and act as a pressure group to remove the black sheep from the sect.

 Rajshree recalled an incident a few years ago in her village where devotees forced a seedy sadhu to leave the village.

 Atul Barodia, a third-generation follower of the sect, has no sympathy for the swamis but believes they are victims of a conspiracy that has its roots in the power struggle between the rival groups.

 That a power struggle is on is evident in Gadhada, a village in Bhavnagar district where a function got underway today to mark 200 years of the sect. Posters of deposed acharya Ajendra Prasad are everywhere and not a single one of acharya Rakesh Prasad, the current spiritual head of the sect. ?One can feel what is going on,? says Barodia.

 On Thursday, police searched the deposed acharya?s residences in Nadiad and Anand and found ?incriminating evidence? after Mansukh Patel, who is in custody, revealed that Ajendra Prasad had hired him to frame the sadhus. Sources say the noose is tightening on the deposed acharya who is likely to be arrested. ?It is a matter of time,? says a police source.

 Additional police commissioner D.G. Vanzara says they are examining the material seized from Ajendra Prasad?s bungalows and the police would call him for ?questioning?.

 Sealdah girl in brothel glare

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Oct. 26: When a group of Benaras Hindu University (BHU) students barged into one of the squalid, dimly-lit rooms in the Shivdaspur red-light district last evening, 12-year-old Rahida Khatoon took them to be plainclothesmen.

 Please dont arrest me; I havent committed any crime. I was brought here three months ago, she said and hid her face in her arms.

 Some 150 BHU students and social workers raided the brothel, 5 km from Varanasi on the highway to Allahabad, and rescued 31 sex workers, mainly children tricked or forced into the flesh trade.

 The students said they decided to act on their own after the local (Madhuadih) police kept dilly-dallying despite being told a large number of minors were being exploited at the brothel.

 We had done some research. We had learnt that a girl from Sealdah had been forced into prostitution there, a student said.

 The students joined hands with Gudia, an NGO which, too, had complained to the police about the brothel. The raid lasted from 5 pm to 8 pm. 

 Of the girls, at least a dozen were from Assam and Bengal.

 Rahida said she lived in Sarkarbazar, Sealdah, and pleaded to be taken back to Calcutta. I lived with my uncle. Three months ago, a man brought me here after promising to find me a job as a maid in Varanasi, she said.

 The district police are unhappy. They have filed two FIRs, one of them against the students. This FIR is based on a complaint by some of the brothels adult sex workers that the students had snatched their belongings and money and molested them.

 The second FIR, lodged by the NGO, names a certain Rahmat as the kingpin of the racket. He apparently runs a network of traffickers who bring young girls to the brothel. Rahmat is in hiding.

 National Commission for Women chairperson Girija Vyas wrote to the district authorities this morning, asking them not to target the students.

 I heartily laud the initiative of (the) BHU students and urge the police not to be harsh on them considering their intention was honest although their move might not be legally authorised, she said.

 But the senior superintendent of district police, Navneet Sikera, questioned the raid. The unfortunate part is that none of the traffickers could be arrested. It was the poor women who bore the brunt of (the action by) some over-enthusiastic social workers, he said, adding the police would probe the incident.

 One of the girls, Reshmi, had asked a student, Tum mujhe yahan se nikaal rahe ho. Iske baad kya hoga? Kahan jayenge hum? Tum mujhse shaadi karoge kya (You are taking me out of this place. What will happen after this? Where shall I go? You are not going to marry me, are you?) Her rescuer replied: We are students, we are still studying; we cannot bear to see you here.

 The girls are at a home for women in Varanasi. 

 Their guardians will be contacted, said city superintendent of police Anant Dev.

 Wage woes 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 17: After the sweet taste of success, the bitter truth.

 The BJP?s newly-elected legislators in Bihar are crying foul as, according to a Bihar legislature act, they will not get salaries and other entitlements until they take their oath of office.

 BJP MLA Rameshwar Prasad urged the Supreme Court to strike down the provision as ?unconstitutional?, saying a legislator is deemed elected from the date his name is notified by the Election Commission. Prasad?s petition was accepted and will be heard on April 4.

 Once elected, an MLA cannot hold an office of profit and his salary is his only means of sustenance, the petition argued. A legislator needs to travel extensively within his constituency and cannot be deprived of his travel allowance, it said.

 Buddha plea

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee petitioned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for ITBP forces to guard the state?s border against intrusion by Nepal?s Maoists.

 ?Bengal is under a lot of pressure because of the situation in Nepal. We want ITBP forces to guard our border adjoining Nepal,? said Bhattacharjee after meeting the Prime Minister today. The chief minister said he ?hoped? his request will be met with.

 Bhattacharjee fears that turbulence in Nepal will further threaten Bengal?s already vulnerable borders. He fears that Maoists persecuted by the Nepalese Army may try to cross over to Bengal.

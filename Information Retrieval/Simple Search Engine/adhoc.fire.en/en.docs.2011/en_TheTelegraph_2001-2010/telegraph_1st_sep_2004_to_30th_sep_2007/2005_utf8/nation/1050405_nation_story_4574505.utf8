 Last bow with BJP on lips

 Surjeet: ?Beware?

 New Delhi, April 4: Harkishen Singh Surjeet has warmed up for his last bow with a familiar warning ? beware of the BJP.

 The 87-year-old Surjeet, who is set to quit as CPM general secretary at the coming 18th party congress in Delhi from Wednesday, has asked his comrades not to allow the BJP to destabilise the central coalition. At the same time, he has cautioned that the current arrangement at the Centre hinges on a fragile balance.

 ?The present national level correlation of forces cannot continue for long, and we have to maintain utmost vigilance so that we are able to meet any sudden development,? Surjeet has said in the latest issue of People?s Democracy, the CPM mouthpiece.

 ?It is a tricky situation for the Left. While we cannot allow an unhindered run of the IMF-World Bank policies, we also cannot afford to give to the BJP what it eagerly wants.? In other words, the CPM should stick to its stand of not pulling the rug from under the Congress-led UPA government?s feet, though there might be critical differences on economic policies.

 Surjeet, who has been general secretary for four terms, has along with another veteran, former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu, always been in a minority within his party on tactical political issues. Both have held the view that the CPM should support the Congress at the Centre to keep the BJP out.

 As a section in the CPM is still resistant to proximity with the Congress, Surjeet has warned such leaders that the CPM has not won the ?last battle? with the installation of the UPA at the Centre. ?The 18th party congress is going to meet at a time when communal forces though ousted from power still have the potential to come back,? he has said.

 Pointing to the recent Bihar and Jharkhand elections, the CPM general secretary said the ?non-Left secular forces are yet to grasp the communal threat in full? and the fragmentation of secular votes was damaging the country. 

 So, before giving up the top job, Surjeet has once again reminded his comrades that the BJP remains the CPM?s ?number one? political adversary. ?It is natural that the Left has to negotiate such a situation with utmost caution, when the communal forces are waiting in the wings, hoping that a rift between the UPA and Left parties would give them a chance to come back,? he has said.

 Surjeet also said the situation confronting the CPM is ?particularly complicated?, especially because the UPA government is bent on following the same set of economic policies that have discredited regimes led by P.V. Narasimha Rao, H.D. Deve Gowda, I.K. Gujral and Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the last 14 years.

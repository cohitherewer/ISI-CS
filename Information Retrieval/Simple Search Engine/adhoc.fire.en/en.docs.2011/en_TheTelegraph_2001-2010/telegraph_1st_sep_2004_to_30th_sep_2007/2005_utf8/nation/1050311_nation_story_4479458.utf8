 Security check lands Wipro man in firing line

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, March 10: Prashant Kumar wanted to test how safe his office was. But security is probably the least of his worries now.

 The Wipro employee has landed in a soup for the anonymous call he made yesterday to his colleagues claiming that a bomb had been planted in the office.

 The call, which turned out to be a hoax, forced the company to evacuate its staff and call police to search the building for explosives. The call was later traced to a public phone booth near a petrol station. A few enquiries with the staff there led the police to questionnaires collected by a mobile phone company. The entries in these forms helped them zero in on the 30-year-old.

 ?On interrogation, he told us that he made the call to check the security arrangements in his office and how the police would respond,? a police official said.

 Kumar, who was arrested a few hours after the morning call for playing a prank and later released on bail in the evening, said his worries had been heightened by reports that militant outfits were planning to target infotech companies in Bangalore.

 His company, however, does not seem to share his concern. The infotech major is keen to haul him up for the misdemeanour. ?We have sought an explanation from him for making such a call. We will take appropriate action after an inquiry by the HR department. At this point, it is difficult to state how we will deal with him,? a spokesperson for the company said.

 Earlier this week, the city police found arms and ammunition, including a sten gun, at the cantonment railway station here. 

 But police commissioner S. Mariswamy said neither his counterpart in New Delhi nor the Union home ministry had informed him about such a threat perception.

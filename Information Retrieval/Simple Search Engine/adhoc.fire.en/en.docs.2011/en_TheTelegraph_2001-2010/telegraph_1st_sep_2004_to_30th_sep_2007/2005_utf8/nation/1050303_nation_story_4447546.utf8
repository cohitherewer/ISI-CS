 Bricks fly over new housing tax

 OUR BUREAU

 March 2: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today dismissed fears that the imposition of a service tax on housing would lead to a sharp escalation in real estate prices.

 Builders say the cost of housing could go up by Rs 45-55 per square foot.

 ?I do not want anyone to propagate the idea that the imposition of the service tax of 10 per cent would hurt the housing industry. That is a bogus argument,? Chidambaram said at an interaction with industry leaders in Delhi.

 The budget proposed a service tax of 10 per cent on ?construction of residential complexes having more than 12 residential houses or apartments, together with common areas and other appurtenances?.

 Chidambaram said the tax is on the value added by the builder. He argued that the mechanism would work in much the same way as the modified value added tax (modvat) chain.

 For example, a builder could hire an architect and pay a service tax on his fees. When he sold the flat he would collect a service tax from the buyer. While paying this service tax to the government, the builder would deduct all the service tax payments he himself had made.

 However, real estate developers say no such mechanism exists under the law.

 ?We are not allowed to claim back the credits. There is no provision for set-off against the service tax or excise duty we pay. Builders sell a finite physical asset and not render a service. So how can we charge service tax?? asked Sumit Dabriwala, director of Calcutta Metropolitan Green.

 The Confederation of Indian Industry is going to take up the issue with the finance minister on Friday, he added.

 ?There is little clarity. I am still awaiting clarifications. But, prima facie it seems there could be a hike in prices,? said Harsh Neotia, managing director of Bengal Ambuja Housing.

 Dabriwala explained that the service part is generally 30 per cent of the construction cost. ?So there will be a corresponding rise (because of the service tax). Moreover, steel and cement prices will go up. So we are expecting over 4 per cent rise in cost.?

 Construction cost varies between Rs 600 and Rs 1,200 per square foot.

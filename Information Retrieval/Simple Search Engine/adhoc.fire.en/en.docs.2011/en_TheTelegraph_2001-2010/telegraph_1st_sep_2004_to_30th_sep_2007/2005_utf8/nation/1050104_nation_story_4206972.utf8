 Out of army, into B-school

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Jan. 3: They are used to handling guns; today they held pencils.

 A few appeared nervous as they fiddled with the mouse and darted an occasional glance at the open computer screen in front. The rest listened in rapt attention.

 ?You are still fit, talented and actually in need of an alternative career,? the man lecturing them was saying. ?I hope you will do your best and come out with flying colours.?

 In another time and another place, a response of ?Yes Sir? would have boomed out from the fifty sturdy men. Instead, they merely nodded. After all, this was not an army drill but a classroom in the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Lucknow.

 The students, all ex-defence personnel, today began a special six-month course in Master of Business Administration (MBA) that IIM Lucknow has launched for retired defence officers. The course, said to be the first of its kind, is aimed at resettling officers who take early retirement from the army. The class, in the leafy surroundings of the IIM-L campus, began at 9 when the winter morning mist had still not lifted. The men listened as Major General K.S. Siddhu, director-general, resettlement, who had flown in from Delhi, addressed them.

 For the next one hour, they heard lectures from the institute?s professors on evolving management trends and how unlike as in the army corporate management was not always about decisions imposed from the top. 

 ?We breathed in an academic atmosphere after long and it is a great feeling for us,? said L.K. Singh, who was in the air force.

 For the next six months, the students would stay in the hostel, have lunch and dinner at the mess and be part of other campus activities. IIM-L authorities said the institute condensed a regular two-year MBA course into a six-month one for the retired defence officers after a yearlong research. ?This course includes 30 hours of contact programmes and a week of field assignment at the end of the classes. The defence students would then face a rigorous evaluation process with grading for the diploma,? said Vinod Arora, a senior administrative officer.

 Arora said the resettlement directorate had to take special permission from the defence ministry for the course. Earlier, retired officers used to approach the Management Development Institute in Gurgaon but the three-month course there was inadequate.

 Archana Srivastava, chairperson, management development programme, IIM-L, said the course would familiarise the former officers with economics, price management, information technology and human resource among other things.

 Senior army officers have welcomed the course as at least 60,000 army personnel retire every year of which 6,000 are officers.

 No roars, only eerie silence in Sariska 

 - Vanishing

 One of few: A tiger in 

 Ranthambore 

 Sariska, March 23 (Reuters): Flamboyant maharajahs in natty breeches once combed the sprawling Sariska forest nestled in the low lying Aravali hills in Rajasthan, hunting for the many tigers that roamed the jungle.

 But, today, there?s an eerie silence in Sariska.

 For months, nobody has heard a tiger roar in Sariska and activists fear the story may be the same in sanctuaries across the country, which has almost half the world?s surviving tigers.

 ?It?s probably the biggest conservation scandal in modern times,? said Belinda Wright, the executive director of the Wildlife Protection Society of India. ?There are some parks with none or so few tigers it?s not a viable population. Sariska has been an incredible wake-up call.?

 A recent World Wide Fund-India report says there may be no tigers left in Sariska, a rich deciduous forest which until last year was home to about 16-18 tigers, but where you now only see stunning peacocks and delicate spotted deer roam freely. 

 ?The damage to the Sariska Tiger Reserve is likely to have taken place between July and December 2004. If any tigers remain, their numbers are likely to be small,? said the WWF report.

 Panic over India?s dwindling stock of tigers set in after another non-government group said last month that at least 18 of 47 tigers in the famous Ranthambore park could have disappeared in the past year.

 Alarmed by reports of a rapid fall in numbers, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has ordered a police investigation and created a task force to save the endangered species. 

 But the question on everybody?s lips is: where have all the tigers gone?

 Tigers are poached for their skin, claws and bones used in traditional Chinese medicine, and as coat trims. A single tiger is said to be worth some Rs 22 lakh.

 ?Trade in tiger parts is very high,? said Ravi Singh, the chief of World Wide Fund-India. ?For a few thousand dollars, people are willing to kill the tiger.?

 A shrinking habitat and drought are further pushing the tigers towards extinction: according to government figures, the tiger population fell to 3,642 in 2001 from 4,334 in 1989. A century ago, there were an estimated 40,000 tigers in India. ?But we?d be very lucky if it?s even 2,000, going by some recent seizures,? said Wright. ?Every tiger reserve in India without exception suffers from habitat pressure and poaching.? 

 Bandhavgarh, Sariska and Ranthambore, the showpiece of India?s tiger conservation programme launched in 1973, are big on the wildlife tourism map. 

 While the circumstances vary from park to park, animal rights activists say Sariska exemplifies the overall state of the country?s wildlife management. Wildlife teams at the Sariska reserve, looking for tiger pug marks, found no foot prints in December compared with 178 the same month last year. 

 ?When we were young, we didn?t step out of the house in the evening because we were scared of tigers. You could hear them roar at night,? said Ram Babu Maheshwari, a villager living in the sanctuary. ?But now children play around in the evening.... We haven?t seen a tiger in eight years.?

 Sangh aims democracy gun at Advani

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is gunning for a change in the BJP constitution to democratise the party ? with an eye to curbing L.K. Advanis powers.

 It has dusted up the old Jan Sangh constitution, which gives the party president less powers, and wants the BJP to adopt it.

 With this in mind, the Sangh has called a chintan baithak of its parivar just before the BJP national executive begins on September 16.

 The baithak will be attended by BJP as well as Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders, who have been openly hostile to Advani in recent months.

 The Sangh has, for some time now, been saying that the days of larger than life leaders ? Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani ? are over.

 It wants a redistribution of powers within the BJP to give officials like the organising secretary, general secretaries, vice-presidents and even the state secretaries a degree of independence from the party presidents control.

 At the peak of the Sanghs campaign to oust Advani, its spokesperson Ram Madhav had openly said the BJP needs to be more democratic, with a less powerful president and more powerful organisation.

 The Jan Sangh model offers this possibility.

 The Jan Sanghs office-bearers, including its president, were chosen by an electoral college. It was made up of a representative from each parliamentary constituency and the secretaries of all the state party units.

 Thus elected, the Jan Sangh general secretaries drew their clout directly from the electoral college and did not depend on the presidents whims to hold on to their posts.

 In the Jan Sangh, the organising secretary and general secretaries were extremely powerful. The tallest leader in the party ? Deen Dayal Upadhyay ? was organising secretary for a long time. When he took over as president, Sangh stalwart Sunder Singh Bhandari became organising secretary.

 Bhandari continued till the birth of the BJP in 1980. Through his first term as BJP president, Vajpayee retained Bhandari along with five other general secretaries. But in his second term, he got rid of all the general secretaries except for one ? Advani.

 Under Vajpayee and Advani, the party slowly concentrated all powers in the presidents office.

 The BJP president is now selected by a handful of the partys top leaders in consultation with the Sangh. They let the decision be known and the state units send in their nomination papers with his name.

 The president can nominate all the office-bearers in the party, manning the executive committee, executive council and all other top decision-making bodies. He can remove any party official without an explanation.

 This has helped Vajpayee and Advani carve out their distinct space. This is also the reason the Sangh finds it so difficult to get rid of Advani despite his ideological deviations.

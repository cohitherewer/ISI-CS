The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Speaker says sorry to Opp.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 31: The six-day stalemate in the Orissa Assembly ended today with Speaker Maheswar Mohanty expressing regret, but another minister had his foot firmly in the mouth over his remarks on tribals.

 After six days of deadlock in the House during which the Opposition boycotted Mohanty, the Speaker said he was sorry for his remarks. Raising the issue just prior to the lunch recess, the Speaker said he was feeling sorry about the abnormal situation in the House for the last few days.

 The Opposition had taken exception to a remark of the Speaker on March 23 which led to a fracas following which Congress member Tara Prasad Bahinipati was suspended for seven days. 

 Mohanty, who wanted the Opposition to seek apology, did not press the issue after chief minister Naveen Patnaik did some tough-talking with him. A chastened Mohanty told the Opposition that he did not remember if anyone had made ?uncharitable? comments against him. ?All is well that ends well,? he said. 

 But before the controversy could end, scheduled caste development minister Kalindi Behera landed in a spot over his ?loose talk? on ways to increase the number of depleting tribals in Mayurbhanj district. On Wednesday, BJP legislator from Mayurbhanj Draupadi Murmu had sought a reply from tribal development minister Balabhadra Majhi about the reducing number of tribals in her district. As Majhi was absent, Behera was assigned to reply on his behalf. In his reply, Behera said if the legislators wanted they could raise the number of depleting tribals. 

 Though Murmu took affront to Behera?s reply, she did not raise the issue immediately. As the House reconvened today, Murmu raised the issue calling the minister?s reply as ?tasteless? and an ?insult to tribal sentiments?.

 Srinagar, June 24: A car bomb shattered the calm today at Srinagars Nishat Gardens ? once a favourite Bollywood locale ? killing nine soldiers just back from leave.

 Twenty-five people were injured in the blast that had tourists scurrying for cover.

 All the dead and 21 of the injured were troopers of the 13 Rashtriya Rifles, headed for the Manasbal army camp, 34 km away.

 Militants ? the Hizb-ul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility ? triggered a blast in a parked Maruti packed with RDX as the army convoy drew near it, Kashmir range police chief Javed Mukhdoomi said. 

 I was just entering the garden when the bomb exploded. It shook the area. When I looked around myself, I saw tourists crying and running for cover, said Mushtaq Ahmad, a Srinagar resident.

 The vehicle worst-hit was a bus the army had hired, whose driver and cleaner have been admitted to hospital. The two other civilians injured were passers-by.

 The wounded soldiers were taken to the armys base hospital in the Badami Bagh cantonment area.

 A caller claiming to be a spokesman for the Hizb-ul Mujahideen told a local news agency that his group had carried out the attack.

 Paramilitary troops moved in immediately after the afternoon blast and began house-to-house searches. Several people were detained for questioning.

 The busy highway leading to the Nishat Gardens, on the outskirts of Srinagar, was closed to traffic, forcing the buses carrying Amarnath Yatra pilgrims to take an alternative route to the Baltal base camp.

 The Nishat Gardens ? considered the pick of the famous Mughal gardens around the Dal Lake ? is a tourist hotspot. It was laid by Asif Jah, the brother-in-law of Mughal emperor Jehangir.

 Its beauty is said to have made Jehangir so jealous that he ordered its water supply to be cut off, causing the plants to wilt and the cascades and ponds to dry up. The emperor relented after much pleading, allowing the garden to survive.

 Nishat Gardens also served as the locale for many Bollywood blockbusters of the late 1970s and 1980s.

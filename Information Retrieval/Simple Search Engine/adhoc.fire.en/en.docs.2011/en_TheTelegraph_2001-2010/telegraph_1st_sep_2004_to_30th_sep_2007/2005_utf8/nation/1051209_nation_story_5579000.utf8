 Dasgupta: On protest path

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: As expected, the Left bared its fangs today.

 CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta led the charge in the Lok Sabha against the governments anti-poor policies, a day after labour minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announced that the employees provident fund interest rate has been brought down from 9.5 to 8.5 per cent.

 Let the government understand that the trade unions and the Left parties will no longer be a stamping machine for endorsing their wrong policies, he said. The labour minister makes a statement on this crucial issue outside Parliament even when the session is on. And he does not deem it fit to present himself when the issue is to be discussed here.

 Dasgupta said the decision will cause grave distress to over 4.5 crore workers. 

 The government needed an additional sum of only Rs 700 crore to maintain the interest rate at 9.5. But they chose to ignore the workers distress, he said.

 When brokers from the stock exchange protest against the turnover tax, the government conveniently agrees to lose over Rs 7,000 crore by agreeing to their demands. This is shameful. We are warning them. Thousands of workers are in Delhi to protest. We will not allow them to do away with the only social security the poor have in India, he added.

 Left MPs also referred to the finance ministers capitulation to pressures from players in the capital market. The finance minister had last year diluted provisions of the securities transaction tax that had the potential to curb speculative excesses in the stock market. The turnover tax, as it was called, was expected to collect over Rs 7,000 crore, which was reduced to merely Rs 1,000 crore after the dilution.

 The MPs were joined by members of other ruling coalition constituents like the NCP and, to the Lefts consternation, even the BJP. 

 You have our wholehearted support, was the collective message from the Opposi tion. This is completely unsolicited support, Dasgupta said.

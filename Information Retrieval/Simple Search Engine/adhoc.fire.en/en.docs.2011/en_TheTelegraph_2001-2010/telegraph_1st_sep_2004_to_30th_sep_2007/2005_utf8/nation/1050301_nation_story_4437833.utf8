 Puff pinch to boost health

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: The United Progressive Alliance government?s promise to ensure better healthcare for all, especially the overwhelming majority of the poor and those living in rural areas, has taken effect with the allocation for health going up by nearly 27 per cent for this financial year. 

 The health ministry will now have a total outlay of Rs 10,685 crore as against Rs 8,436 crore last year. 

 The national rural health mission, through which the government hopes to give a fillip to medicare in the countryside, will take off in April. The project hopes to strengthen primary healthcare through grassroots-level public health intervention based on community ownership. 

 Building on the lines of barefoot doctors, the government hopes to train community workers to deliver basic health facilities to villagers. The health worker from the village will also have a supply of medicines to deal with common ailments like diarrhoea, dysentery, headaches, colds and similar uncomplicated problems. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram has said the programme will be funded by money raised through a 10 per cent cess on cigarettes and a surcharge of 10 per cent ad valorem duties on other tobacco products, including gutka, chewing tobacco, snuff and paan masala. 

 By raising the price of cigarettes and other tobacco products which are bad for health, the government hopes to kill two birds with one stone: make prices of tobacco products exorbitant to discourage consumption and generate crucial funds for health schemes in the countryside. 

 Ironically, bidis, the preferred puff of the poor, have been exempted. Bidis are as harmful to health as cigarettes and other tobacco products, but the government probably decided to leave bidis out for fear of hurting its votebank. 

 The bidi lobby is also very powerful in the country. 

 The minister has also allocated Rs 250 crore for building six medical institutes in the lines of Delhi?s All India Institute of Medical Sciences. 

 The NDA government had earlier announced the scheme but had not provided the money. Patna, Bhopal, Raipur, Rishikesh, Bhubaneswar and Ranchi will have the new teaching hospitals. 

 The health ministry has three distinct divisions: health, family welfare and traditional Indian medicines like ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy, unani, siddha and homeopathy. This year, the money earmarked for health is Rs 3,827 crore, as against Rs 2,687 crore in the last financial year. Family welfare will get Rs 6,453 crore, an increase from last year?s Rs 5,524 crore. The Indian system of medicine has also benefited with a grant of Rs 405 crore as against last year?s Rs 225 crore.

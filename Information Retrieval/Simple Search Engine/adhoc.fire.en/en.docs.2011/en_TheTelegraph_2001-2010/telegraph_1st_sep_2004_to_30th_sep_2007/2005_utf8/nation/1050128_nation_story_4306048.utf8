 Blast close shave for bus

 Hyderabad, Jan. 27: Violence unleashed by the CPI (Maoist) in Andhra Pradesh continued unabated with the rebels setting off a landmine in Guntur district today, reports our special correspondent.

 The blast missed the passengers of a state bus by a whisker, hitting its front portion and injuring the driver. A few armed policemen were among the about 50 passengers. 

 DSP Jitender said the policemen spotted about 10 rebels hiding in the bushes and fired at them, starting a gunbattle. 

 The Naxalites have gunned down seven people in the last 48 hours as the government refused to accept their fresh conditions to resume peace talks.

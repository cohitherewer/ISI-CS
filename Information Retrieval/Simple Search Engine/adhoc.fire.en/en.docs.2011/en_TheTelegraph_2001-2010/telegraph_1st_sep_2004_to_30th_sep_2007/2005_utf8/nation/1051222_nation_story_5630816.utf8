 Radioactive drill at Narora

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: At 7.32 on Tuesday morning, a telephone call from the Narora Atomic Power Station in Uttar Pradesh set into motion a four-hour mock emergency drill that pretended radioactivity was about to engulf two neighbouring villages.

 Narora station director Dev Kumar Goyal called in sub-divisional magistrate Manoj Kumar who declared an off-site emergency at 8.45 am, alerting police, paramedical staff and the state bus transport service that had a vehicle on standby for the exercise.

 We do this once every two years as part of emergency preparedness, Goyal told The Telegraph later.

 Indias atomic power stations have a 1.6-km exclusion zone within which no habitation or activity is allowed. Any event that leads to the leak of radioactivity beyond this zone is classified as an off-site emergency, Goyal said.

 Its hard for me to envisage how this might actually happen, he said. Like other Indian atomic power stations, the Narora station, which is located close to the Bulandshahr tectonic fault, has multi-layered safety systems. Strong ground motion after an earthquake will lead to automatic shutdown of the plant, he said.

 But the mock emergency yesterday assumed that radioactivity had leaked from the plant and was heading towards Gangagarh and Rambas, two villages with a combined population of about 2,500 about 5 km from the plant.

 Policemen from Narora and Ramghat positioned themselves at diversion points along roads leading to the plant and paramedical staff from local government hospitals moved in with iodine tablets to be used as an antidote to radioactivity exposure. The bus drove in from a depot 20 km away to both Gangagarh and Rambas and returned as part of the evacuation exercise.

 At 11.40 am, a scientist in the environmental survey laboratory at the power station reported reduction in radiation fields in the affected areas. And Neena Sharma, the director for off-site emergency and the district magistrate of Bulandshahr, declared an end to the emergency. 

 Goyal then called an end to the exercise and sought feedback from experts watching the drill.

 The Nuclear Power Corporation that runs Indias atomic power stations said the exercise was quite successful.

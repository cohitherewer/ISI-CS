 Promise to junk rote learning

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, May 30: School students ? if they are lucky ? may soon escape the torture of studying a cumbersome curriculum that requires learning by rote.

 The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) under its new director, Krishan Kumar, has brought out a blueprint of a new school curriculum that will replace the one drawn up during the NDA regime.

 The new draft will be placed before the Central Advisory Board of Education next week. This is just a concept framework and a beginning, said Kumar.

 The promise of an imaginative curriculum is anything but new and goes back almost two decades to 1986 when the new education policy was mooted. The policy assured a glorious education system that would ease the tension of students and increase comprehension skills.

 However, the system has become more taxing, driving students to despair and often to taking their lives on being unable to cope with failure and tension. 

 One of the main chapters in the new education policy was how to create a system that would deliver the new concept, said Anand Swarup, the then education secretary and the brain behind the 1986 policy.

 Successive governments since then have dabbled with the concept but failed to put in place the system that would make it possible for the new syllabus to work, Swarup said.

 One of the main reasons for the failure lies in not being able to re-orient the teachers to teach a curriculum that requires different teaching skills, asserted Swarup. The curriculum will say one thing, the text books a second thing and the teachers a third thing, he said.

 The fact that learning has become a source of burden and stress on children is an evidence of the deep distortion of educational aims and quality, says the new draft curriculum. It says the new school syllabus will shift the focus from learning by rote to understanding. It will make examinations more flexible and integrate them with classroom life, the draft underlines.

 A section of those working on the new curriculum and the textbooks that would be used from the next academic session is hopeful of success.

 The hope lies in the effort that is being put by all of us into making the syllabus and the textbooks conform to the concept in the curricular framework, said Anita Rampal, who teaches in Delhi Universitys education department and is a member of the group of curriculum experts. We are struggling to put together an integrated syllabus that will end compartmentalisation of subjects, said Rampal.

 The task of authoring textbooks will begin after the education advisory board puts its stamp of approval on the new curriculum.

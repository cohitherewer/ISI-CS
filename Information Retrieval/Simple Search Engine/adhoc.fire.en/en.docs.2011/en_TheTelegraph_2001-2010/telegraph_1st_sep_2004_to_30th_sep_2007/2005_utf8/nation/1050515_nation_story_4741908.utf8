 Jharkhand

 Ranchi, May 14: The BJP faced a full-blown revolt in Jharkhand today, reports our bureau. 

 Dissidents demanded the removal of Yadunath Pandey, whose appointment as the new president of the state unit was announced yesterday.

 He would be forced to resign his Lok Sabha seat and the party national vice-presidents post if the BJP fails to reconsider the decision, said former chief minister Babulal Marandi.

 Wastelands on job radar

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: The National Advisory Council, chaired by Sonia Gandhi, has proposed to the Centre that when the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act is implemented in the 200 pilot districts, top priority should be given to wasteland development programmes.

 Such programmes, whether they relate to watershed management, afforestation, soil conservation or pasture development, are highly labour-intensive and contribute to poverty alleviation, said NAC member and former bureaucrat N.C. Saxena.

 On the councils behalf, Saxena sent a set of recommendations to the government on wasteland development and farm forestry, one of which is linked to the employment guarantee scheme. 

 He said the wasteland programme could be incorporated in Schedule-I of the act that lists various schemes and programmes the district collectors and field officers could pick and choose for engaging labour.

 Saxenas note said:

 Growing trees on private wastelands (as opposed to good quality land which can be used for more labour-intensive annual crops) was desirable, economically and socially, because it could substantially enhance farmers incomes and produce the much-needed biomass. 

 Governments attention has, therefore, to shift to research bearing on wasteland development and complementary agro-forestry in the rain-fed and semi-arid regions of the country, as also to investments in wastelands. 

 The subject of wastelands and agro-forestry could be assigned to a specific ministry or government department, with measurable targets.

 Consider doing away with subsidies to industries buying wood and bamboo from government forests in order to correct price distortions and protect farmers interests, which are adversely affected by the production and sale of commercial wood from government forests to industry. 

 Review the decision to allow duty-free import of pulp. 

 The council recommended that while free import of timber could continue (because it reduced the pressure on the countrys forests), a similar sop for pulp hit the farmers hard because eucalyptus and bamboo ? both sources of pulp ? are short-gestation crops and eminently suitable for the farmers.

 Resuscitate unproductive and degraded lands not by giving them away to industry as captive plantations but by engaging people. If productivity is defined in terms of subsistence value, then such forests (deemed as unproductive) are an important source of livelihood for the poor. Such lands may have low tree density but fulfil the fuel wood and fodder needs of some 100 million people, said the note. 

 It underlined the point that such lands did not require capital investment or high-grade technology as protection and recuperation that can be done only by working with people.

 The council note critiqued the working of the joint forest management scheme and observed that the poor still saw it as a contract and tend to approach it with a what will we get, if we protect your forests? attitude.

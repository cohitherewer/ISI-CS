 British agency freezes funds

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 28: The Orissa government will no longer receive financial support from a British agency, which had been granting funds for poverty alleviation.

 The British aid agency, Department for International Development of United Kingdom, would no longer provide direct budgetary support to the Orissa government following a diktat from the UPA Government at the Centre.

 ?In the past, a lot of money coming to Orissa was in the form of direct budgetary support. The present government in Delhi has asked us not to undertake budgetary support and so we are not going to give any such support. The funds provided would henceforth go directly to developmental projects on the field,? said Andrew Hall, deputy high commissioner to Eastern India, at a press meet here today.

 DFID has been providing financial support to the state government to help allocate resources for the poor. It provides assistance for poverty reduction through support for the Poverty Task Force. DFID?s assistance in Orissa was Rs 185 crore (?24.7 million) in 2001-2 while in 2002-03 it was Rs 357 crore.

 All DFID assistance is provided entirely as a grant. 

 ?I understand the chief minister has announced a single-window clearance. That is good news for us,? he said.

 ?This year, we expect the UK trade to reach $10 billion. But we realise that there is a lot to cover. We need to make a further push in the trade area,? he said.

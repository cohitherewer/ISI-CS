 DGP to file death report

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 9: The Orissa State Human Rights Commission (OSHRC) has sought a detailed report from the director-general of police within three weeks on the custodial death of an accused in the lock-up of Sahid Nagar police station in the city last week.

 Perusing the petition filed by human rights activist and advocate Prabir Das, OSHRC chairperson Justice D.P. Mohapatra and two other members issued a notice to DGP Bipin Bihar Mishra with a directive to submit a detailed report explaining the circumstances under which Dillip Sahu died in the lock-up. 

 Mishra will also have to furnish copies of the post-mortem report indicating the cause of death and the findings of the subdivisional magistrate?s inquiry. 

 Four officials, including the officer-in-charge of Sahid Nagar police station, R.P. Behera, have been suspended in the suicide case pending investigation.

 The death rocked the Assembly as the members demanded action against the officer-in-charge.

 Dilip Sahu, who was arrested in connection with a snatching case, was found hanging from an iron bar above the lock-up gate on the morning of March 3.

 Police said Sahu seemed to have used his full-sleeve shirt to hang himself from the bar. He was found dead around 4.30 am. Besides Sahu, there was another person in the lock-up.

 The policemen on duty as well as the other detainee had no idea of how and when Sahu committed suicide. The police also remained tight-lipped about what could have driven the accused to the extreme step.

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has announced in the Assembly that the incident would be inquired by the human rights protection cell of the state police.

 Residents of Sahu?s native village in Patkura block of Kendrapara and the victim?s widow have lodged two separate complaints with the police demanding the immediate arrest of the Bhubaneswar policemen they felt were responsible for the death.

 The complaints by the residents of Batira and Sabita Swain stated that Sahu was innocent and was subjected to third-degree treatment in the police station where he died.

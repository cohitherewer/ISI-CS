 Buta forms committee for arrests

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, March 17: The fight for law and order continues in Bihar, with Governor Buta Singh leading the charge.

 Singh has constituted a high-level committee for proper implementation of the latest high court order against criminals roaming freely in the state. 

 The court yesterday directed the police to arrest the absconders ? who face non-bailable charges ? at the earliest. It also asked director-general of police Narayan Mishra and other senior officers to report to it by March 31.

 Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam has been made chairperson of the committee.

 ?Having consulted the officials concerned, we decided to form a committee for speedy implementation of the court order. The order is a very serious one and I want all to take it seriously,? the governor said.

 Subramanyam suggested that the administration would leave no stone unturned this time to ?carry out the order?. ?We are determined to implement the court order promptly,? he said.

 The court order and the prompt reaction of the administration have raised hopes of a better future among residents of the capital. ?It is refreshing to learn that the police force has become alert, prompt and always on the move,? said Lakshmi Sahu, a political observer.

 ?The police can work more freely now as they are no more haunted by the fear of transfer or political interference in their work,? a senior officer confided.

 Yesterday, people here were thrilled to see DGP Mishra shuttling between the headquarters and the Town police station after the court order. He apparently spent about an hour at Sri Krishnapuri station trying to solve a suspected case of abduction. It was later found that the student who had disappeared was not kidnapped but was involved in a love affair.

 Expressing concern over the supply of illegal firearms in the state, Mishra urged children not to ruin their future by getting into crime.

 Chief secretary Subramanyam, who is also the acting special adviser to the governor, is busy reviewing the law and order situation these days. He said the delay in the appointment of special advisers has not affected administrative work in the state. ?Nothing is pending and nothing will be allowed to be pending,? he added. 

 Subramanyam further said the authorities would look into the threat perception to former ministers, politicians and officers and take appropriate steps.

 The governor has reportedly directed the administration to ensure security to all the newly elected legislators of Bihar. A group of MLAs had earlier met him and sought security.

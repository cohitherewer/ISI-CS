 Paswan foes turn active 

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, March 22: Rivals Laloo Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar are cosying up to each other with the objective of consolidating half the backward social base and thus isolating Ram Vilas Paswan.

 Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party contested elections on its own for the first time and secured a rainbow social combination. Of his 29 MLAs, nine are Bhumihars, seven Rajputs, three Brahmins, one Kayasth, three Yadavs, three Koeris and three Dalits.

 He could not get a single Muslim elected though as many as eight minority candidates of his party stood second.

 For the first time in 15 years after the post-Mandal backward consolidation that catapulted Laloo Prasad to power, backward caste leaders such as the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief and Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav of the Janata Dal (United) are worried.

 Last month?s Bihar elections threw up the upper castes as key players.

 Sharad Yadav is now advocating the reunification of all old socialists (read Mandalites) to counter the likely revival of the Congress and check the Lok Janshakti. 

 Dal (U) and RJD strategists feel that a throwback to the pre-1990s ? when power shifted from upper castes to Other Backward Classes ? is necessary.

 The political space will then be occupied by the RJD-Dal (U) versus the BJP, the latter having replaced the Congress. This suits the backward caste leaders as the BJP factor will keep the Muslims with them. 

 The first signs of Nitish warming up to Laloo Prasad were visible on Saturday in the Lok Sabha.

 The Dal (U) leader launched a scathing attack on Paswan, whom he was wooing till central rule was clamped on the state. Nitish later looked towards Congress president Sonia Gandhi and asked: ?How long will you do the balancing act? You choose between Paswan and Laloo Prasad.?

 Blasting Paswan?s comment that President?s rule had launched Bihar on the path to development, Nitish said: ?Khatals are being removed, cows and buffaloes are herded into trucks and taken away in the name of vikas (development)?. After the polls, Paswan said ?the garbage has to be cleared (read RJD rule)?.?

 According to insiders in both camps, efforts are on to split Paswan?s MLAs to ?weaken the LJP and show Paswan his place?. Laloo Prasad is extending a helping hand to Dal (U) strategists.

 They aim to get 20 Lok Janshakti legislators to merge into either party using loopholes in the new anti-defection law that allows a two-third merger. They believe Paswan?s upper caste MLAs are easy targets.

 But Paswan is not sitting idle. Sources said he is aware of the machinations. Paswan could pre-empt the move by expelling around 10 MLAs, the sources said.

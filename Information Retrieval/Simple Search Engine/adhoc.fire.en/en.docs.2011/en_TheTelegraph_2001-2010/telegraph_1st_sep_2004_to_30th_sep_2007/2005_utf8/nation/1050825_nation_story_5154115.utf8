 Principal clicks student in the nude

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Vijayawada, Aug. 24: A school principal took nude pictures of a Class VII girl in his chamber, loaded them into his office computer and threatened to sell them to a porn magazine if she told anyone.

 When the 14-year-old finally told her parents after a few days of agonised silence, a huge crowd of guardians stormed the school in Vijayawada and beat up V. Srinavasa Rao before handing him to police.

 Furious police officers, some of whom had daughters studying in the same school, forced Rao to spend the night in the lock-up in his underwear before producing him in court this morning. The 40-year-old was granted bail but returned home to find that his wife and two daughters had left him.

 The principal had called the girl to his chamber last week, forced her with threats to strip and taken her photographs with a digital camera. He later enlarged some of the pictures on his computer, showed them to the girl and told her to keep her mouth shut.

 After suffering in silence for a couple of days, the girl confided in her class teacher, Shanta, only to be told she couldnt help her. If I take up the issue, Ill lose my job, the teacher said. She, however, asked the girl to tell her parents.

 When she did, her mother Durga, a social worker, went from door to door, telling neighbours and the parents of other students of the school what had happened. Yesterday morning, some 200 of them barged into the school.

 At first, Rao denied the accusations and threatened to call the police. But soon his bravado left him and he admitted his act. I took the photos because I wanted to send them to a contest, he told Durga. But the indignant mother screamed: What sort of competition accepts nude pictures?

 Durga dragged Rao out of his office and began beating him with her slippers. Other guardians and students, too, joined in. 

 The police said the principal had been ill-treating the girl for the past two months. My daughter would often come home bearing the marks of a cane on her hands. At that time I thought it was just a case of disciplining, Durga said.

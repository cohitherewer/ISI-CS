 Notice on Singh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: The NDA has served breach of privilege notices against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for allegedly leaking details of the budget to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi last week. 

 Sonia had written to Singh urging him to keep the promises made in the common minimum programme in mind while preparing the budget. He had replied saying that her concerns would be addressed to. 

 Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today said the notices were under his consideration. ?The notices for breach of privilege against the Prime Minister for alleged violation of the secrecy of the Union budget 2005 are under my consideration,? he said.

 Chatterjee made the observation in the House shortly before the budget was presented when NDA convener George Fernandes demanded that his notice be referred to the privileges committee. The Speaker said he had also received notices from P. C. Thomas and BJP leader V.K. Malhotra.

 Left wants Ram to back Laloo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 8: The Left parties want the United Progressive Alliance government to pressure Ram Vilas Paswan into supporting a secular government in Bihar even though they are publicly adopting a ?hands-off? policy. 

 The leaders say they are leaving the matter to the UPA government. 

 Two days ago, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet said his party would not interfere in Bihar. Privately, however, CPM leaders are saying that since Paswan is a Union minister in the UPA government, he should help in the formation of a secular government in Bihar.

 The Lok Janshakti Party leader, however, has made it clear he will not support an RJD-led government. He conveyed this to the Bihar governor a day before President?s rule was recommended. 

 Paswan today met the home minister and the Prime Minister. He thanked Manmohan Singh for imposing central rule in Bihar and requested him to appoint good officers in the state. Iterating his criticism of Laloo Prasad Yadav, Paswan said the railway minister should not treat the UPA government as his fiefdom. ?It is not just one person who has toiled for the formation of the UPA government. We have also spent our sweat and blood,? said the Union steel minister. 

 Laloo Prasad yesterday met Surjeet and thanked him for standing by him through thick and thin. The Left parties are not in favour of fresh elections in Bihar so soon ? a reason why they want the ruling alliance to pressure Paswan to support an RJD-led government in Bihar.

 The Left agrees with Laloo Prasad that the Congress president Sonia Gandhi?s advisers ? Arjun Singh and M.L. Fotedar ? were responsible for the mess created in seat sharing. ?I hope the Congress has learnt some lessons from these elections,? said a Left leader. ?Sonia Gandhi is not responsible for what happened in these elections. She was being given wrong advice,? he stressed.

 The Left, however, has decided not to advise the Centre even though Singh called up CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan a day before the governor recommended President?s rule and sought his advice. Singh told him that there seemed to be no way out other than imposing President?s rule.

 Spruce-up promise after IT boycott

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Sept. 15: The Karnataka government today moved to placate belligerent infotech companies which had threatened to boycott the states yearly flagship IT event here next month unless civic amenities improved in the silicon hub.

 After a meeting with industry representatives, the Congress-led coalition disclosed plans to spruce up roads and get rid of traffic bottlenecks over the next three months.

 The government also assured the representatives of the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce and the Bangalore Forum for Information Technology ? the last two had threatened to skip the IT.IN event ? that it would upgrade infrastructure through a slew of medium- and long-term measures.

 The industry has offered to fund and support our long-term projects. They (the companies) have assured to support the government in the image-building exercise, chief secretary B.K. Das said.

 Das said the government would make every effort to improve the image of the city and its living conditions.

 After the meeting, BCIC president Ananth Koppar said IT companies will support the government to improve facilities in Bangalore. We have clarity and, therefore, will not take to confrontation. In a day or two, we will take a decision on our boycott threat.

 On September 20, chief minister Dharam Singh will discuss the citys infrastructure problems with top executives of IT companies.

 Singh, however, has been forced to walk a tightrope on complaints of inadequate facilities because some ministers from his coalition partner, the Janata Dal (S), attacked these companies and questioned their contribution to the states development and creation of job opportunities for Kannadigas.

 Infosys chief financial officer Mohan Das Pai countered the allegation at todays meeting. The industry has provided jobs to five lakh people. We are contributing $23 to $25 billion of foreign exchange to the country. So do not hurt the image of the industry because it will in turn hurt the country and this state. The IT industry contributes 25 per cent of Karnatakas GDP. The debate on the issue should end here, Pai said.

 Som Mittal, the president and CEO of Digital Globalsoft Ltd, said the industry would soon hand over a white paper to the government on reforms essential to sustain the growth in the sector. We will help the government draw up a time-bound plan and its implementation will be monitored by the state and the industry.

 Sources in the industry said the crumbling infrastructure had no impact on the flow of investments. Between April and July this year, 64 new companies set up shop with an investment of Rs 1,181 crore, they said.

 Fire devours heritage college

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, March 3: Assam?s third oldest educational institution, the 62-year-old B. Borooah College, was today reduced to ashes in a devastating blaze that began around 6.40 pm and raged for nearly three hours. 

 At ground zero, all that remained were mangled metal and a few half-burnt wooden planks jutting out from the smouldering embers. 

 In the hearts of hundreds of pupils past and present, all that remained were memories of an educational institution whose founder principal was also the state?s first chief minister, Gopinath Bordoloi.

 ?Everything is finished,? cried principal Rekha Deka, who watched helplessly along with hundreds of others as flames leapt from one portion of the structure to another. 

 Barring the department of zoology, a portion of the physics department and the newly built auditorium, nothing could be saved. There were murmurs of foul play because the fire appeared to have started simultaneously at both ends of the semi-circular old college building. 

 Home minister Rockybul Hussain, however, pleaded for restraint. ?It is too early to say anything. We will know only after the investigation is over,? he said at the site of the blaze.

 Students and staff expressed anger over the delayed start of the fire-fighting operation. 

 Inmates of the boys? hostel, attached to the college, said the first fire-tender arrived nearly half-an-hour after the fire was detected. 

 Students blocked the entire stretch of Nehru Stadium Road and shouted slogans against the fire department. 

 Jatin Mipun, the director of the State Fire Service Organisation, denied allegations of a delay in dousing the flames. ?We did whatever we could. The fire spread very fast, thanks to the wooden structure,? he said. As many as 16 fire-tenders were pressed into service initially. Additional fire-tenders from the army and the airport were brought in later, but the blaze just kept growing bigger and bigger. 

 Sheaves of answer-scripts of the higher secondary final and degree examinations were lost in the fire. The college was open till 4.30 pm because of the examinations. 

 Some students out for an evening stroll said they saw the fire starting at the examination branch. They claimed to have heard a deafening sound resembling an explosion.

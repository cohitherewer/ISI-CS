 Kin-rapist in custody

 Lucknow, June 16: Ali Mohammad, who raped his daughter-in-law Imrana Bibi in a Muzaffarpur village last week, has been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days, reports our special correspondent.

 Arrested last night, the 59-year-old was today produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court.

 The rape not only provoked Imranas husband Nur Elahi to divorce her by uttering the triple talaq, she was also ordered out of the village by the local qazi as the assault had altered her relation with her husband.

 Elahi, whose move to utter the triple talaq was criticised by Muslim scholars and women activists, is absconding.

 Rural job bill

 New Delhi, July 1: The much-awaited National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill will be introduced in Parliament during the monsoon session starting from July 25, report our special correspondent.

 A parliamentary standing committee headed by senior BJP leader Kalyan Singh, which scrutinised the employment guarantee scheme, has almost finalised the report. Singh had earlier drawn flak from UPA leaders for deliberately delaying the report.

 Confirming the bill will be tabled in a month, rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said the modified bill will provide employment guarantee for 100 days to all rural adults ready to do unskilled jobs.

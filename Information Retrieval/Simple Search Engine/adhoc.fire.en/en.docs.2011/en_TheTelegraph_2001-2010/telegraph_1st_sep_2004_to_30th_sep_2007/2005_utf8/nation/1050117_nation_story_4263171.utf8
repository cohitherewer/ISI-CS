The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 MLA gunned down at noon 

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 16: CPI-ML legislator from Bagodar Mahendra Prasad Singh was gunned down this afternoon, triggering questions about security in extremist-dominated areas ahead of the elections and conspiracy theories that blamed everyone, from Naxalites, politicians to a senior police officer, for the murder. 

 Singh, 50, was talking to some physically challenged persons at Durgi Dhowaiya village in his constituency, around 75 km from Giridih, after addressing a meeting in the area when three persons, dressed as commandos, drove up in a motorcycle and asked for him. Kedar Mandal, a CPI-ML cadre who was with Singh, said: ?The three persons first asked, ?Mahendra Singh kaun hain.? Singh replied, ?Main Mahendra Singh hoon.? At this, the three whipped out revolvers and shot him from point-blank range. 

 The legislator sustained bullet wounds in his head, neck and other parts of the body. Sources said he suffered 13 bullet injuries in all. But police sources said the exact number of bullets fired could be ascertained only after the autopsy report.

 Chief minister Arjun Munda has told the police to hunt down the culprits within 48 hours and said his government would go for a CBI probe ?if the circumstances so desired?. 

 Speaking in Calcutta, where he went to receive BJP president L.K. Advani, Munda said: ?It is still not clear whose hand is behind the killing. We will not tolerate killings in the state. I have directed the police to take immediate action. I have told them that I need results within 48 hours.? Singh?s killing, Munda said, was a ?personal loss?.

 Home secretary J.B. Tubid did not rule out the possibility of Naxalites having a hand in the killing. The police in Giridih, a district wracked by Naxalite activities, were working on the line that the killing could have been executed by the Maoists active in the region.

 Superintendent of police Deepak Verma said: ?It could be an extremist act.? But reports from Patna said the CPI(Maoist) has denied involvement in the murder.

 The cadre brought the body to the Women?s Teacher Training ground at Bagodar and demanded a CBI inquiry. One section blamed a state minister for the murder while another saw the hand of a senior police officer. 

 Opposition parties alleged that it was a ?political killing? and questioned the security arrangements in the areas dominated by Naxalites. 

 The Congress dubbed Singh?s murder a ?political killing? and urged the Governor to intervene and ensure an impartial inquiry.

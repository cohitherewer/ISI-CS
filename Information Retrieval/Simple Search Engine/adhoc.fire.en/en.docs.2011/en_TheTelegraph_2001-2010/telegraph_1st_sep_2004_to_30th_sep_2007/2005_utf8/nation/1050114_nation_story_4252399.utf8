 Pay bait to end strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 13: The Bihar government today played the ?wait and watch? game in the ongoing employees? strike saga even as the state Election Commission dangled the salary carrot in a bid to break the deadlock.

 The poll panel promised the employees that it would recommend full salary for the strike period if they called off the agitation right now.

 On the expiry of the extended ultimatum yesterday, chief electoral officer K.C. Saha ordered all district magistrates and commissioners to take necessary action against the employees for the alleged violation of the Representation of People Act, 1951.

 But the employees have stood firm and refused to end the strike. ?We are ready to go to jail and make any sacrifice, but we will not give up till our demands are met,? said Manjul Das of the Bihar Rajya Arajpatrit Karamchari Mahasangh.

 Bihar Sachivalaya Seva Sangh general secretary Anil Kumar Singh said, ?We are not against conducting our poll duties. But let the government first meet all our demands. Our strike started before the model code of conduct came into effect.?

 The striking employees, who have accused the poll panel of being biased against them, will organise dharnas in places where training sessions for the elections are going to be held. They also threatened to ?take on? those employees who report for poll duty.

 Reacting to the threat, the commission ordered the state authorities to arrest those employees who obstruct poll-related work under Sections 186 and 187 of the Indian Penal Code. 

 ?The Election Commission has power over all government employees when the poll process is on,? state assistant electoral officer Sahadat Hassan Minto said.

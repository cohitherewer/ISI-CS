 Security boss role recast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Pakistani national security adviser Tariq Aziz did not have a meeting with his officiating Indian counterpart, M.K. Narayanan, which suggests that the government may appoint a special emissary for the back-channel dialogue on Kashmir with Islamabad. 

 Strategic experts claim that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh might redefine the role of the national security adviser by having another expert to engage in border talks with China. Narayanan?s predecessors, the late J.N. Dixit and Brajesh Mishra, had dealt with both Islamabad and Beijing. 

 There are two views on the subject in the establishment. The first is that the security adviser is best placed to sustain the ?momentum? generated by political breakthroughs in long-standing problems with Islamabad and Beijing. The experience under Dixit and Mishra is being used to bolster this argument. 

 The second line is that the security adviser should not burden himself with diplomatic negotiations, which are best handled by specially empowered envoys. 

 While Singh has kept his own counsel, sources close to him said he proposes to give the institution the shape he is ?most comfortable? with. 

 Narayanan?s appointment indicated that a larger role in the conduct of foreign policy is not part of Singh?s concept of a national security adviser.

 The sources stressed that since both Dixit and Mishra were from the foreign service, an impression had been created, wittingly or unwittingly, that the security adviser?s priority was ?diplomacy?. 

 This, they said, led to the neglect of other functions envisaged for the adviser, like internal security (this area includes management of ethnic and religious relations, dealing with the rise of Left extremism and co-ordination of policy among different agencies), economic security and external security (the transformation of India?s border management, management of the nuclear arsenal, modernisation of armed forces and so on). 

 Narayanan is from the Indian Police Service. 

 It is believed that when Narayanan was made the interim national security adviser, he made it clear that he was not interested in handling the nitty-gritty of the post?s executive duties. These included briefing the Prime Minister daily on security, coordinating the interface of key ministries, supervision of RAW, back-channel talks with Pakistan and being a special representative in Sino-Indian talks, a job description that Dixit had inherited from Mishra. 

 In taking another look at the national security adviser?s role, the sources said the government believed the primary focus should be on ?national security?, an area not deemed to be a traditional stronghold of the external affairs ministry.

 Is Sarabjit an Indian?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Islamabad, Sept. 2: Freedom still seems some way off for Sarabjit Singh as India needs to verify whether the man lodged in Pakistans Kot Lakhpat jail is actually an Indian national falsely implicated in a bomb blasts case. 

 On Tuesday, two Indian diplomats met Sarabjit, on death row for his alleged involvement in the blasts in Pakistans Punjab. But after an hour with him, the officials were neither sure of his nationality nor were they certain of his claim of innocence. 

 Pakistan identifies Sarabjit as Manjeet Singh, a RAW agent, and Delhi can make a formal appeal for his clemency only after it is satisfied that Sarabjit is indeed an Indian who has been falsely charged.

 A diplomatic bag containing his details and his assessment by the officials is to reach Delhi this evening. 

 Sources said the delay in sending the assessment was because Indian high commission officials here were not confident of sending the sensitive document through an ordinary courier. As the weekly diplomatic bag only goes on Friday, they had to wait. 

 As a practice, diplomatic bags are not checked by the customs and are generally used by officials at different high commissions and embassies. 

 Today, Sarabjits family met .k. Advani in Delhi after which the BJP president appealed to Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to intervene in the case. 

 The whole world will praise him and all Indians will be forever indebted to him if he does, Advani said.

 Sarabjits case came up during discussion at the foreign secretary-level meeting between the two sides yesterday. But Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran made it clear that the talk was not limited to an individual but to all the prisoners that the two sides have in each others jails. The Pakistani side confirmed this and added that Saran only thanked Islamabad for allowing consular assess to Indian officials to meet Sarabjit. 

 Sources said the Indian officials who met Sarabjit at the jail superintendents office in Lahore were a little surprised at his alertness during the discussion. Although he had been in prison and must have been interrogated by Pakistani officials a number of times, he showed no apparent sign of wariness or of being shattered. 

 Sarabjit maintained that he had inadvertently strayed to the Pakistani side and had nothing to do with the blasts in Punjab. He also gave the Indian officials a letter, some photographs and other documents for his family in India. 

 All the documents, along with the assessment made by Indian officials, have been sent to India in the diplomatic bag.

 Indian officials in Delhi will now get in touch with their counterparts in Punjab to verify the details Sarabjit has given them. They will also have to go to his village and other places to establish if he is an Indian. 

 Sarabjits lawyers in Islamabad are awaiting the detailed judgment on the case from the Pakistan Supreme Court. The apex court has only given a short statement upholding the military courts judgment of death penalty. A review petition by his lawyer will be filed only after the detailed judgment of the Supreme Court, expected in the next few days, is out.

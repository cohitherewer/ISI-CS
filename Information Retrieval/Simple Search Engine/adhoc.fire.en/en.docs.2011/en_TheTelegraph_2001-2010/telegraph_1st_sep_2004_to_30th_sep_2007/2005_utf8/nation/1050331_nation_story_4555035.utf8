 Open mind on Pervez

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Port Louis, March 30: Neither cricket nor the state of the weather will be on Manmohan Singh?s mind when he meets Pervez Musharraf in the middle of next month.

 ?When two politicians meet, they cannot confine their discussion to the weather,? Singh said, adding that he had an open mind.

 The Pakistan President will be visiting Delhi at least for two days for the ostensible reason of watching the one-day match there between India and Pakistan on April 17.

 Singh?s comment that he would approach the meeting with an open mind is important because India was reluctant to give Musharraf?s trip any official orientation and had even sat on issuing an invitation to the President after he expressed the wish to watch a match of the ongoing Indo-Pak series.

 India had proposed a venue ? Kochi ? away from Delhi in order to prevent an impression from being created that cricket was the mask for an official visit.

 Kochi was unsuitable for Musharraf?s itinerary and Delhi it was. And it should come as no surprise if Kashmir intrudes on cricket. 

 Singh said the US decision to sell F-16s to Pakistan would not affect his dialogue with Musharraf, but expressed his ?disappointment?. ?I have said the F-16s have come at a time when we are engaged in a peace process?. It has come to me as a disappointment.?

 Emphasising the need for constant engagement between South Asian countries to ?understand each other?s point of view?, Singh said a discussion on Kashmir would be governed by the Indo-Pak joint statements of January 6 and October 4, 2004. 

 Both underlined the need to come out of straitjacketed positions, keeping options open on Kashmir and to ?persevere? with ?cooperation as opposed to the old path of conflict, hostility and mistrust?.

 On the US offer of civil and nuclear cooperation, Singh?s response was circumspect. ?More details on the package they have offered are awaited. While we want the strategic relationship to grow, I believe we have to discuss the matter with them and explore to see what they have in mind.?

 On domestic politics, Singh was less forthcoming. He admitted that the government had not taken a ?firm decision? on appointing advisers to the Bihar governor nearly a month after the state was brought under President?s rule. 

 He made it clear, though, that the endeavour to form a government there should not exclude Laloo Prasad Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal. Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party ? a constituent of the ruling Delhi alliance ? has been insisting on a non-RJD, non-BJP coalition. 

 ?The RJD is a valuable ally of ours and there is no change in that situation,? said Singh.

 SC helps widow get back girl

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has 

 come to the rescue of a widow from Punjab whose in-laws 

 had been depriving her of her daughters custody to 

 grab her property.

 The attempts of the family to divest Nirmaljit Kaur of the property and keep the child away failed after a DNA test established that they were not producing the real daughter of the widow, forcibly taken away from her eight years ago.

 The court has directed the family to produce the girl before it on January 6. The result of the DNA test is now crystal clear that the child produced before this court is not the real child of Nirmaljit Kaur and her real child is in the custody of her in-laws, it said.

 Kaur, whose husband Surinder Singh Batra had died in 1997, had alleged that her in-laws had forcibly kept her daughter Simran whose whereabouts was not known since 2000. She also accused them of fabricating the will of her husband. 

 Driver killed in Babri protest

 Kasaragod (PTI): A tanker lorry driver 

 was killed when a group of people, observing a strike on 

 the 13th anniversary of the Babri mosque demolition, pelted 

 stones at the vehicle near here on Tuesday. 

 Sheen, 25, who was travelling from Thrissur to Mangalore, received severe head injuries in the attack around 3 am. He lost control of the lorry and rammed into a roadside tree, police said. 

 While the driver died on the spot, the cleaner of the lorry escaped with injuries.

 Security was beefed up in the area and several other sensitive parts of the district after the incident. 

 Racial bias

 London (PTI): An NRI has won a racial 

 discrimination case against the Glasgow city council in 

 Scotland that refused his promotion in favour of a less 

 qualified woman five years ago.

 Killer son

 Baghpat (PTI): A youth allegedly bludgeoned 

 his parents to death and then set himself on fire over a 

 land dispute at a village in Uttar Pradesh on Monday. Shailender, 

 26, attacked his father, mother and brother with a blunt 

 object when they were sleeping. The injured brother has 

 been hospitalised.

 VC defends quota step

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 23: The vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Naseem Ahmed, today said the decision to allow 50 per cent reservation for Muslims in some courses was within the ambit of the Constitution under Article 31 (1).

 We have done it in only 43 courses of higher technical learning out of a total of 289 after getting a go-ahead from the Centre and actually it comes to only 15.2 per cent for all the courses, while the BJP-led NDA that is criticising it now had allowed 50 per cent reservation across the board to Delhis Jamia Hamdard University.

 There is nothing communal about it. The proportion of Muslim and non-Muslim students is still going to remain the same. The difference will be that now we would get better Muslim students from all over the country and not just those from among the internal students or from only Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It is a step to enhance the level of AMU as a national university, he said.

 However, he said the university continues to provide 25 per cent seats to internal students and reduce it slowly so that the existing system is not demolished in one go.

 Under the old policy, 50 per cent seats were reserved for internal students, while the remaining 50 per cent seats were for students selected on the basis of countrywide tests.

 Now, while 50 per cent seats are reserved for Muslim candidates, 25 per cent are for internal students and the remaining 25 per cent for students in the general category.

 Ahmed added that the decision was also in line with the judgment of a 11-judge bench of the Supreme Court in the TMA Pai Foundation case, in which the court had said minority educational institutions would have the right to admit students of their choice.

 There is a history behind this decision that started when a committee under Badaruddin Tayyabji in 1987 recommended 50 per cent reservation for Muslims. The same was cleared by the executive council, academic council and the court of the AMU. 

 Then, again, recommendations to the same effect were made by the Mumtaz Ahmed Khan committee in 2001 and duly cleared by the universitys councils but it could never be applied, as the then Union government sat on it. Now, when the UPA government has accepted and allowed it, it is being made into an issue.

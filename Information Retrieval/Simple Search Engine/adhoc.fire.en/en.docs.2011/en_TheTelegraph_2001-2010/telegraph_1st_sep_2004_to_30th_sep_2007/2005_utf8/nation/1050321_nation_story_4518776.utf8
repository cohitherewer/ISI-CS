 Tahil wins UK work rights

 London (PTI): Bollywood actor Dalip Tahil, 

 who was forced to quit a BBC soap after immigration authorities 

 ruled that he was working illegally, has won the right to 

 work in the UK, official sources said. 

 Tahil, 52, visited the UK in 2002 to appear in the Westend musical Bombay Dreams. Later, he joined the BBC as head of the new Asian family in its popular soap, Eastenders, but was forced to leave the country after the immigration ruling 14 months ago. 

 British Asian actors were reported to be unhappy about an Indian actor being chosen for the part instead of someone more local and the actors? union voiced its objection. 

 Tahil complained of being subjected to a ?hate campaign?. 

 Immigration minister Des Browne has apologised for the poor handling of Tahil?s case following an appeal launched earlier this month with the immigration appellate authority. 

 Tahil?s forced departure, following the immigration crisis, led to abandoned plots and a hurried rewriting of the script. Finally, a decision to axe the family was taken in October 2004.

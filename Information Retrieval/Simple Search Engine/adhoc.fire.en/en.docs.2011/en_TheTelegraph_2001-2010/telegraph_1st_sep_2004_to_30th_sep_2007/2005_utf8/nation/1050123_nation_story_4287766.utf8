 Bihar employees call off strike

Patna: Government offices got back to business on Saturday 

after striking non-gazetted employees reached an agreement with the authorities 

late on Friday night, reports our correspondent.

 The three leading associations of over three-and-a-half lakh employees called off their 43-day strike after the agreement proposal was sent to the Election Commission for approval. The commission?s sanction is mandatory as dates have been announced for the Assembly elections in Bihar.

 Sources said all but one of their seven-point demands have been accepted. The agreement will be made public only after the poll panel?s approval.

 While the government has deferred a decision on increasing the retirement age from 58 to 60, merger of 50 per cent of the dearness allowance with the basic pay will begin from this month.

 The government has reportedly agreed to sanction earned leave and travel allowance for about 300 days of strikes held in the past. The demand of assured career promotion will be taken up soon by a special committee.

 ?The employees? worries of the last seven years are over now and we have decided to resume work after arriving at a respectable agreement with the government,? Bihar Sachivalaya Seva Sangh general secretary Anil Kumar Singh said.

 The Election Commission had issued two ultimatums to the employees to end the strike and threatened punitive action. It had also made preparations for alternative manpower to conduct the Assembly elections.

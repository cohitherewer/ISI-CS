 Passport aide vows to sing

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Nov. 13: Madhya Pradesh police are keeping a tab on a man who claims to be an old associate of Abu Salem. Siraj, who is out on bail, is reportedly under police protection.

 Siraj had got false passports for the don and Monica Bedi in Bhopal in June 2001.

 The police have also launched a search for Samira, said to be Salems first wife.

 Siraj said he would start singing once they are produced here. I will say a lot but in court, he said from his flat at the posh Koh-e-Fiza locality.

 What you have heard so far about them is merely 10 per cent, Siraj said, claiming to be a police informer. If I were a close associate of him, I would not have fled Dubai where the don reportedly has property worth Rs 200 crore.

 Siraj said many of the high and mighty are likely to be named as the case proceeds. Have you noticed that the name of a former cricketer and a film star is already doing the rounds? My problem is that I know too much but I have four kids to look after, too.

 In Bhopal, senior police officials spoke in conflicting voices. One officer quoted former chief minister Digvijay Singh as saying that Siraj was used by the intelligence agencies to lure Salem to Bhopal. He was given protection when the dons gang tried to kill him for his double cross. Another section considers Siraj a gas bag, saying his brief association with Salem is not significant.

 Isros eye in space turns ten

 The IRS-1C satellite orbits the Earth

 New Delhi, Dec. 30: It was a birthday that no one had really expected would arrive. There was a dinner but no cake, and the birthday child was 817 km above the Earth.

 Indian space scientists celebrated earlier this week the 10th birthday of IRS-1C, the countrys longest-surviving remote sensing satellite, an eye in space that gave them some of their proudest moments.

 The IRS-1C satellite launched aboard a Russian rocket on December 28, 1995, was expected to remain operational for three years. But after 10 years in orbit, the satellite continues to send images of the Earth around the world.

 Its like a child whos done extremely well and makes us proud, said S.K. Shivkumar, director of the Indian Space Research Organisation Telemetry Tracking and Command (Istrac) in Bangalore, the housekeeping centre for Indias remote sensing satellites.

 The satellite has orbited the Earth more than 60,000 times and sent 1.5 million images to the National Remote Sensing Agency in Hyderabad. The pictures have helped engineers find groundwater, plan metropolitan roads and estimate crop yields.

 While previous Indian remote sensing satellites have endured for up to eight years, Isro scientists said the flawless performance of IRS-1C is particularly gratifying because of its unique imaging capabilities. 

 IRS-1C was a wake-up call to the world about Indias capabilities in space imaging, said a senior Isro engineer associated with the project. 

 Over the past decade, IRS-1C images have been picked up by 24 groundstations in Europe, the US, Australia and Japan. India began to export the images captured by the cameras aboard IRS-1C, earning over $10 million.

 The IRS-1C was equipped with a unique combination of Earth-observing cameras that no other satellite possessed at the time and provided the finest images available from any civilian satellite.

 The IRS-1C had a resolution. The best satellite then was the European Spot which had a resolution of 10 metres, said an engineer. An international satellite with comparable capabilities went into space only in the late 1990s.

 For India, IRS-1C helped in town planning, crop estimation, forest-cover mapping and hydrogeological studies to pinpoint sites for digging borewells. Bangalores Ring Road was aligned with the help of IRS-1C images of the city, an Isro engineer said.

 Isro officials say the extended lifespan was possible through efficient use of onboard propellants. At Istrac, engineers have been firing onboard propellants every few months by remote control to maintain the altitude of the satellite and its inclination with respect to the Earth. The propellant has depleted from 84 kg at the start of its mission to less than 5 kg.

 Its still working, but its also an ageing satellite. And some day, soon, well allow to retire it gracefully, said Shivkumar who was IRS-1C mission director while the satellite was being built and launched.

 Over the past decade, Isro has sent into orbit six more remote sensing satellites ? some of them far more advanced in imaging capabilities than the IRS-1C.

 Shivkumar said even when Istrac stops firing the propellant rockets aboard IRS-1C, the satellite is expected to continue orbiting the Earth for several decades because the drag imposed by the Earths atmosphere at 800 km is very low.

 On Wednesday, hours before the birthday dinner, Shivkumar went to the Istrac control room and personally monitored the health of the satellite he had helped build. I guess, theres some emotional attachment, he said.

 While IRS-1A and IRS-1B had preceded IRS-1C, routine operations with both satellites had ended after about eight years in orbit.

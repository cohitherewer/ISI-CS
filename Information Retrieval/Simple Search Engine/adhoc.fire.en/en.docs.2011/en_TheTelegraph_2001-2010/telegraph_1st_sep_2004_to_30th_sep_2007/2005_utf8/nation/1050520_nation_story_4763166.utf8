 Bar girl raped on way home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 19: Mumbai recorded its 17th rape in 28 days early this morning when a bar dancer was pulled off a taxi and gangraped on her way back from work.

 Police have arrested three persons for the crime, which comes four weeks after constable Sunil More raped a 17-year-old college girl inside a police post at Marine Drive.

 The 32-year-old victim of todays rape, employed with the Sai Plaza dance bar at Saki Naka in the western suburbs, had taken a cab around 3 am, police said.

 A short distance from the Central Government Staff Colony on Antop Hill, where she lives, the taxi was forced to stop by three persons. 

 They beat up the driver and dragged the victim to a nearby building. Two of them raped her while the third kept watch, police said.

 The victims screams brought a police patrol to the scene. The police caught one of them on the spot and, working on leads gained from him, arrested the other two within 12 hours. 

 Javed alias Jawa Ali, Ravindra Phansolkar and Vivek Ghate are residents of CGS Colony. They were produced before the Kurla metropolitan magistrates court and remanded in police custody till May 26.

 The CGS Colony has long been a residential hub for bar girls in search of cheap accommodation.

 The bar girls form a sizeable group of tenants here.

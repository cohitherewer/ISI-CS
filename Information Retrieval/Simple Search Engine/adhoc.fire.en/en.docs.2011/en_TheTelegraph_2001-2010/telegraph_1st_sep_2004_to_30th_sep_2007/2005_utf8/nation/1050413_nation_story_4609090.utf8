 Case rests with family suicide

 Mumbai: A sessions court has abated the 

 trial of Balkrishna Dalal and his wife Sonal, who, along 

 with their 20-year-old daughter, jumped to death from their 

 eighth-floor apartment in Malabar Hills on March 28, reports 

 our correspondent. 

 Abatement means the case has been virtually closed, though an heir can go on appeal and reopen the issue.

 Balkrishna was a dealer in textile spare-parts. For seven years, the Dalal couple had fought a case defending themselves against charges of driving Balkrishna?s parents to death ? the elderly couple had also committed suicide in the same way in 1998. 

 March 28 was the day of the final verdict. 

 Police believe the trio committed suicide fearing conviction. The Dalal couple had earlier been arrested by Malabar Hill police for allegedly harassing Balkrishna?s parents. 

 On March 28, after the court was informed about the suicides, the judge deferred the final verdict to April 12.

 Dalal?s advocate Majeed Memon said on Tuesday: 

 ?We moved an application placing on record that the Dalals 

 were no more, and requested the court to abate the case 

 according to the legal structure.?

 Memon said he had been given two wills, dated March 24, written by Balkrishna and Sonal. They named Sonal?s brother Vikram Maniyar as the inheritor of their over Rs 5-crore property.

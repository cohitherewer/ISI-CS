 Holes in monsoon model

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 1: The vagaries and variations of the monsoon this year have exposed the limitations of the forecasting model currently used by Indian weather scientists for annual predictions.

 A spurt in rainfall in the last week of June has lowered the all-India deficit from 49 per cent as it stood on June 22 to just 15 per cent by June 30, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) announced today.

 But the surprisingly subdued rainfall in the four northeastern states, Bihar, Jharkhand and Marathwada over the past weeks is causing concern. The situation is unlikely to improve in the next five days, it said.

 In its annual long-range forecast of the monsoon earlier this year, the IMD had predicted normal monsoon for the country. But its forecasting method cannot predict the rainfall variations over time and space during the June-September season.

 Despite a late onset and a hiatus in mid-June, the monsoon had covered the entire country on June 30, nearly two weeks before the usual date. A depression in Gangetic West Bengal accelerated the monsoons movement westward. It took just six days to extend from eastern Uttar Pradesh to western Rajasthan, a move that usually takes a month.

 While rainfall in Bihar has been 54 per cent below normal, the deficit in Jharkhand has been 62 per cent. Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura have a 56 per cent deficit. 

 A senior IMD officer conceded that its forecasts had failed to predict the subdued rainfall over these northeastern states. The model also did not foresee the faster-than-usual movement of the monsoon in northwest India.

 Forecasts from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting show that stark variations in rainfall across regions will persist over the next week.

 In flood-hit Gujarat, the downpour is likely to continue till July 4, the IMD said. Marathwada, which has had a 56 per cent deficit, is unlikely to see an increase in rainfall until July 5. 

 Central and northwest India are expected to experience increased rainfall over the next five days.

 The IMD is next week expected to issue a forecast for rainfall in July, a month crucial for agriculture. An experimental forecast by a government laboratory in Bangalore had predicted that rainfall would be 12 per cent below normal in July.

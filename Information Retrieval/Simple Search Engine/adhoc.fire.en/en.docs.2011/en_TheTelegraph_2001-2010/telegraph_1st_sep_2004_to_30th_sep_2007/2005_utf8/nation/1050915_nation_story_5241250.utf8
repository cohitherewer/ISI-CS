The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No shake-up at conclave, says Naidu

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Sept. 14: The subject of leadership change will not figure in the BJPs three-day national executive beginning here on September 16, M. Venkaiah Naidu said.

 The party vice-president had been asked at a news conference whether the conclave would discuss the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs objections to L.K. Advani holding on to the dual posts of party president and leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.

 There is no proposal (for discussing this), Naidu replied. The RSS never interferes in the political line of the BJP. It never dictates the political agenda of the party, though we take inspiration from the RSS on issues concerning nationalism.

 He conceded that because of the recent happenings, a certain amount of dent in the image of the party has happened, but insisted that the BJP had put the Jinnah and Madan Lal Khurana controversies behind it.

 So whoever is expecting a churning and a turning point at the executive ? being held after five years ? would be disappointed.

 Instead, it (the national executive) will be a moving point ahead, Naidu said. The BJP is looking to refurbish its image and remove the misconceptions in the minds of some people.

 The conclave will focus on two issues: one, a critical review of the United Progressive Alliance governments performance and two, a review of the (BJPs) electoral preparedness in states headed for Assembly polls ? Bihar, Assam, Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry.

 There will be some discussion also of Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP believes state polls could take place soon because of fissures in the ruling coalitions.

 Apart from these, the executive will discuss the special situations in various parts of the country.

 The meeting will open with Advanis address on September 16 evening. Earlier, in the morning, there will be a preparatory meeting of party general secretaries and one of state BJP chiefs and general secretaries. Each state president will present a report on his unit during the conclave.

 The executive will pass three resolutions: one on the political situation, another on internal security and a third on economic issues.

 On September 17, the party will organise a public meeting in Chennai. The following day, Atal Bihari Vajpayee will wind up the proceedings.

 Naidu was hopeful of a clean sweep by the National Democratic Alliance in Bihar. He cited the deep resentment against the Rashtriya Janata Dal. We have decided that Nitish Kumar will be the leader of the alliance in Bihar, he said, implying that the Janata Dal (United) leader would be the coalitions candidate for chief minister.

 Bengal resists gas dual price

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: Bengal and Orissa were among the states that opposed the petroleum ministrys proposal to introduce dual pricing for cooking gas and kerosene at a meeting here today. 

 The proposal aims at restricting the subsidy on the cooking fuels to families living below the poverty line to reduce the burden on public sector oil companies.

 Convened by petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi, the meeting was attended by the secretaries of food and civil supplies of 20 and odd states. Some officials took the stand that they would have to get back to the political leadership to decide.

 Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu opposed the proposal at the meeting itself and pressed for continuing with the existing pricing. 

 Currently, oil companies lose around Rs 100 per cylinder of gas and Rs 12 per litre of kerosene. To lower the burden on the downstream oil companies ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum ? the Centre has asked ONGC and Oil India to bear Rs 12,000 crore of the subsidy on kerosene and gas this year. 

 The ministry wants to reduce the cost to oil companies by making the better-off sections pay more for the cooking fuels. But the political thinking in the states is that not all families living above the poverty line have an income that will make a sharp price hike affordable.

 Indian Oil executive S. Manjunaths murder in Uttar Pradesh still fresh in the mind, the meeting also discussed adulteration of petroleum products. 

 The petroleum secretary urged the state governments to provide security to oil company officials to help them curb adulteration.

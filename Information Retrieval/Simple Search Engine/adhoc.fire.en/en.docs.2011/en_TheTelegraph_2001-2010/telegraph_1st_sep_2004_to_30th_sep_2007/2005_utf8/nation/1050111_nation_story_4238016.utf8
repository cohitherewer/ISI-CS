 Arrests over code flout

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Islampur, Jan. 10: Kishanganj municipality chairman Tilak Ranjan Jain and BJP councillor Madhab Modi have been arrested on charges of violating the Election Commission?s code of conduct and refusing to respond to summons from the court.

 The district judge of Kishanganj today refused to admit petitions from both of them when they arrived in court for anticipatory bail as warrants for their arrest had been issued by the court several times. The judge remanded them in jail custody for an indefinite period.

 Sources said cases were filed against the duo for allegedly defacing walls during the 1995 Bihar Assembly polls. After failing to get them to appear in court, police declared them absconding in 1999.

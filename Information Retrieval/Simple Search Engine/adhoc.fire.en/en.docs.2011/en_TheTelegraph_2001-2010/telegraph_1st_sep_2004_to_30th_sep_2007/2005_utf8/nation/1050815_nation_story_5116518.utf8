The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Celeb at temple gate? Not again 

 Guest Column - Shobhaa D eacute;

 Aishwarya Rai prays 

 at the Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai in a much-publicised 

 visit in July. (PTI) 

 This is really getting a bit too 

 much. Every other day, one sees pictures of movie/TV stars 

 praying at a popular temple at Prabhadevi. We are provided 

 several nuggets of largely irrelevant information regarding 

 the visit. Whether the celebrity walked, ran, rolled or 

 was airdropped. Barefoot, or shod. Head covered, or bare. 

 Who came with whom. At what precise time? Post-aarti 

 or pre-? Which particular scheme the person has subscribed 

 to ? gold card membership or a maamuli silver? How 

 much do these privilege cards cost? Duration of darshan? 

 What was asked of god? Donation if any.

 I find this highly intrusive and 

 deeply offensive, to both the celebs themselves and other 

 lesser known devotees. Why is this temple indulging in such 

 an aggressive publicity drive? What for? A place of worship 

 has to retain its sanctity above all other considerations. 

 And every worshipper who goes there has the absolute right 

 to privacy. Does Ganpati Bappa know or care who holds a 

 platinum card? That would be reducing Mumbais adored 

 deity to a credit card manager, peddling benefits to members 

 with the highest spending power.

 It was never this bad, nor this 

 blatant. In recent times, religion has been hijacked by 

 politicians and businessmen (sharks, if you ask me). Temples 

 provide the best revenue models and offer the highest returns. 

 True. But to exploit a place of worship and convert it into 

 a commercial enterprise whose brand equity goes up in direct 

 ratio to the number of Bollywood stars visiting it, makes 

 me feel ashamed and sorry.

 I feel equally astonished by the 

 fact that these stars allow themselves to be photographed 

 during what ought to be a deeply introspective and inspiring 

 moment ? not a cheap photo-op, for gods sake! And 

 yet, we see an entire galaxy of big names posing away, hands 

 folded, aarti thalis in hand. Some arrive 

 with faces artfully made up. Others look suitably humble 

 and casual. While still others offer sound bites about the 

 state of their blistered feet after walking 15 kilometres.

 These darshans 

 are generally at some unearthly hour. Chances of even the 

 most diligent presswallahs just happening to be present 

 at the venue are pretty dim. So, who alerts the press? And 

 why? How come lensmen show up at 3 am to catch a megastar 

 at prayer? And how come those flashbulbs are allowed inside 

 the temple when regular devotees get no such privilege? 

 Why can certain VVIPS jump queues and get an instant one-on-one 

 with god, while others wait in line for hours on end and 

 are then rudely hustled away, mid-prayer, by overzealous 

 temple guards who push and shove them around roughly? Does 

 god himself keep an appointment diary with celeb entries? 

 These are disturbing issues that 

 need to be addressed by those keen on converting what used 

 to be an unpretentious, humble shrine as recently as 10 

 years ago. There were no barricades and sandbags then. People 

 who wished to enter could do so without the present coupon 

 system. Okay, now that the numbers have ballooned beyond 

 expectations, I agree its necessary to bring in some 

 order and discipline, especially on Tuesdays and other auspicious 

 days. Thats fine. But I appeal to those in charge 

 of marketing this complex not to offend and 

 insult the sentiments of anonymous worshippers who come 

 there with faith in their heart and a prayer on their lips. 

 To ask such persons to move aside and make space for paparazzi 

 while movie stars pretend to commune with god is the worst 

 travesty. That goes for all other similar places that try 

 and cash in on peoples belief. Its a gross violation 

 of our collective sensibilities. Leave orchestrating photo-ops 

 to lounge bars owners and boutique babes. Ganpati is a tolerant, 

 forgiving god. But even he has a limit. Let us not test 

 his generous nature. Let us not try his patience, or else...

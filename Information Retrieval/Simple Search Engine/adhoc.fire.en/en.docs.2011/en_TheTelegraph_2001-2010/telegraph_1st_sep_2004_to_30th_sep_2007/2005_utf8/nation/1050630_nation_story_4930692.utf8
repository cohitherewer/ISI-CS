 Mulayam door ajar for Sinha

 New Delhi, June 29: Mulayam Singh Yadav has opened his doors to rebels from every major party. His aim is to turn his own into a national party, able to take the Congress on anywhere in the country.

 The Samajwadi Party chief, sources said, is wooing BJP dissident and former Union minister Yashwant Sinha with an eye on expanding his partys base in Jharkhand.

 Sinha apparently prefers expulsion by the BJP to walking out, because he does not want to lose his Rajya Sabha seat. He is considering the Samajwadi Party as well as the Nationalist Congress Party and the Janata Dal (United) as possible destinations.

 Defectors have served Mulayam Singh well. For instance, former Karnataka chief minister S. Bangarappa won the Shimoga Lok Sabha byelection early this month to open the Samajwadi Partys account in the southern state.

 The Samajwadi Party chief is said to be extremely pleased because after pushing the Congress to the margins in Uttar Pradesh, he is planning to take it on in the south.

 With this in view, Mulayam Singh has been coaxing Jaya Prada, actor and Rampur MP, to take charge of the party in her home state of Andhra Pradesh. 

 Jaya Prada, too, is a former rebel, having joined the Samajwadi Party after falling out with Telugu Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu just before the 2004 general elections.

 Sources said Mulayam Singh feels the glamorous Jaya Prada can do a Bangarappa in Andhra. But she is reluctant to take up the state presidents job because she does not feel confident about taking on seasoned politicians like Naidu. 

 She also feels her film career is not yet over and would not like to throw herself into politics full-time.

 Last year, Mulayam Singh made forays into Bihar to weaken his caste rival, Laloo Prasad Yadav, in his lair. Dadan Pahelwan, once a Rashtriya Janata Dal strongman, joined the Samajwadi Party on the eve of the 2004 elections, hurting the RJD in about a dozen seats in Bhojpur.

 After opening its account in Karnataka this month, the Samajwadi Party has been involved in a tug of war with the Desam for their common election symbol, the bicycle.

 Mulayam Singhs party, which has seats in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttaranchal and Karnataka, has petitioned the Election Commission to declare it a national party. If the poll panel obliges, the Desam, being a state party, might lose its symbol.

 Loss rap on distributors

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 16: The Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) has pulled up the four power distribution companies in the state for their failure to bring down transmission and distribution losses.

 ?The performance of the companies in terms of loss reduction, improvement of collection and the resultant aggregated technical and commercial (AT amp; C) loss indicates that they have failed to stick to the target set by the commission,? the OERC observed while approving the business plan of the distribution companies recently. The four utilities are Southco, Cesco, Nesco and Wesco.

 While Nesco has been asked to restrict the loss to 29 per cent by 2007-08, the target is 25 per cent for Wesco and 30 per cent each for Southco and Cesco.

 OERC authorities are concerned over the rise in distribution losses even after six years of privatisation, crossing the 25-per cent limit set by the commission for a period of five years, beginning 2002-03. 

 While Cesco has been under the supervision of OERC after the US-based AES quit in 2001, the three other utilities are run by Reliance Energy (REL).

 In 2001-02, all except Southco registered a rise in losses over the 1999-2000 figures. Though the losses marginally declined in 2002-03, it again shot up in the next fiscal for all power utilities except Cesco.

 While the average transmission and distribution loss of the four companies at the end of 2003-04 was 41 per cent, the AT amp; C figure was pegged at 50 per cent.

 Train from Puri looted

 SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR

 Giridih, Oct. 11: An armed gang robbed passengers on a Puri-New Delhi train today and allegedly threw one of them onto the tracks. 

 Two of the dacoits were, however, caught by the passengers of Purushottam Express led by an armyman. 

 The dacoits later said a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) cook was among their accomplices. 

 Armed with traditional weapons, the robbers struck around 11 am, when the train was between Gomoh (in Dhanbad) and Parasnath (in Giridih) stations.

 Witness reports said three robbers were already in the train and about seven others boarded it at Gomoh. 

 Soon after the train left the station, the looters got into their act and the travellers were forced to part with about Rs 1.5 lakh in cash and valuables.

 The robbers would have fled as the train pulled up at Parasnath, but for Harbansh Singh. Emboldened by Singhs show of defiance, the other passengers joined him and managed to nab Mohammad Imtiyaz and Akbar. 

 Residents of Barmasia caught another dacoit, Ranjit Kumar Dubey, later. He was trying to hide in a house in the locality near the station.

 No information about the passenger said to have been pushed out of the moving train was available.

 The dcaoits said Pandit Rana, a cook from a CRPF camp, was also involved in the robbery. 

 The Government Railway Police (GRP) have recovered about Rs 7,000 from the trio captured. Dhanbad superintendent Setu Hembrom said the police have started raiding suspected hideouts. We have got vital clues and we will be able to solve the case soon, he added.

 The dacoits are believed to be from Gomoh. 

 No railway official could be contacted for comment. Neither the railway officials nor the GRP personnel at Parasnath station answered phone calls through the day.

 The express continued on its journey after stopping for an hour at Parasnath station.

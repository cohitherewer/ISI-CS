 India, UK tie up for stem cell study

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, April 4: Scientists from Britain and India are set to combine resources and know-how in stem cell research to evolve new techniques of treatment for ailments of the heart and eye and high blood sugar.

 The discussions on potential areas of collaboration commenced at a week-long Indo-UK stem cell workshop today. In addition to therapeutic applications, the scientists are likely to work together on basic research and training, the latter aimed at enhancing manpower in both countries. 

 ?Our discussions will lead to identification of projects beneficial to all of us,? Prof. Azim Surani, director, Cambridge Stem Cell Genetics Programme, UK, told reporters.

 Endorsing his views, Prof. D. Balasubramanian, chairman of the task force on stem cell research, department of biotechnology (DBT), said common policy initiatives ? only cloning of organs for therapeutic purpose and a strict no to whole body cloning ? would facilitate partnerships between the two countries. 

 ?There?s a very good climate in terms of funding. We have spent Rs 15-20 crore on specific projects in stem cell research in the last five years. Currently, 15 labs across the country are involved in stem cell research and six medical institutes are associated with them in conducting clinical trials,? he said. 

 ?We have submitted a proposal for an exclusive stem cell priority fund to support research. We want the ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research) and the DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation), too, to contribute 30 per cent of the research budget for stem cells projects. Now, we have the support of the DBT,? Balasubramanian added.

 According to Prof. K. Vijay Raghavan, director of the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, the Union government has allocated about Rs 20 crore over the last five years to stem cell research projects for therapeutic cloning. 

 ?Since stem cells have the ability to develop into specialised types of cells that are found in muscle, liver and brain tissues, they have the capacity for unlimited replication. The human body can use stem cells to make specialised cells to replace those that wear out,? Raghavan said.

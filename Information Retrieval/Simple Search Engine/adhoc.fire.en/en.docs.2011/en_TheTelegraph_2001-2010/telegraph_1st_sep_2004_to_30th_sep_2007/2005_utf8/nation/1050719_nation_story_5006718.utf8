 Mumbai, July 18: When its Bollywoods bad boy, call him to the police station in full public glare. When its Bollywoods prettiest woman, we are at your service, madam.

 Thats the message Mumbai police gave today as a crime branch team landed at Aishwarya Rais multi-storeyed Le Mer apartment in Bandra.

 A day after Salman Khan was questioned at the crime branch unit in suburban Mumbai, the police decided to shield the Bride and Prejudice star from the waiting media. A group of eight policemen arrived in two jeeps at the heavily guarded Le Mer Apartment around 1.15 pm.

 The sleuths were inside Rais 12th-floor flat for over two-and-a-half hours recording her statement and later her voice.

 The voice samples of Salman and Aishwarya would now be sent to the forensic laboratory at Hyderabad to see if they match those in the conversation tapped by the police. Transcripts and audio clips of the conversation ? apparently tapped by the police and reported by the media ? show a man addressed as Salman Khan abusing and threatening a woman he refers to as Ash.

 The man also says he knew all information about every single blast, referring to what is believed to be the March 12, 1993 serial explosions in Mumbai.

 No information was available on what method the police adopted while questioning Aishwarya, but it may have been a similar process undertaken while recording Salmans voice yesterday. On Sunday afternoon, assistant commissioner of police Trimbak Yengde had summoned two social workers as witnesses when Salmans voice sample was taken.

 A line from the purported tape was played out and the actor was asked to repeat it. He was given a sheet of paper with the transcript of a conversation and was asked to read it loudly into a cellphone. A recording device was attached to another cellphone outside the ACPs chamber to record Salmans audition.

 Salman told the police officers it was not his voice on the purported tapes.

 The police remained tight-lipped about the visit to Aishwaryas house, though senior officials confirmed that the voice sample was taken.

 Aishwarya is believed to have told the police that the voice on the controversial tape was not hers, but there was no independent confirmation. The actress as well as her secretary Hari Singh refused to answer their mobile phones. Her lawyer Girish Kulkarni was not present during Aishwaryas questioning.

 Yes, her statement was recorded. Investigation is continuing and, therefore, I would not be able to comment on what happened, Kulkarni told reporters outside the sessions court where he appeared in connection with another case.

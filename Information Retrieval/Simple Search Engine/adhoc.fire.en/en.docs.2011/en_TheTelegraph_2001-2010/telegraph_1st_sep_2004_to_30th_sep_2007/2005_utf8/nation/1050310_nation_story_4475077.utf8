 Axe on Karunakaran son

 New Delhi: The Congress high command 

 has cracked the whip on indiscipline in its Kerala unit, 

 suspending former chief K. Muraleedharan in a move sources 

 said was a warning to his father K. Karunakaran, reports 

 our special correspondent.

 The action, considered a gamble before the Assembly polls early next year, is a ?trial balloon?, said a party functionary. It is intended to send ?strong signals? to the former chief minister, who has been questioning the high command?s authority, the functionary added.

 The leadership decided to suspend Muraleedharan late on Tuesday night to dissuade Karunakaran?s supporters from attending the first of the three public rallies organised by his faction at Kozhikode on Wednesday. 

 The high command had asked him to call it off. But Muraleedharan justified the move, asserting that it was meant to strengthen the party ahead of the polls.

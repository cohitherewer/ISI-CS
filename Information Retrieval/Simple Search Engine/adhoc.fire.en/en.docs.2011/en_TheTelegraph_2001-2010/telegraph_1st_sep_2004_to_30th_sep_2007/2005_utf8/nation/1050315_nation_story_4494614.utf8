 Navy amp; air force in mass move-up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 14: Nearly 3,000 officers in the air force and the navy were promoted today after the defence ministry brought the promotion policy for the two services on a par with the army. The move is part of the exercise to give the officer cadre of the armed forces a youthful profile.

 The ministry implemented the recommendations of the A.V. Singh committee report on the restructuring of the army?s officer cadre on December 16. The upshot was that about 19,000 officers from the ranks of lieutenant to colonel were promoted to higher ranks in one day. The promotions for the air force and the navy are being implemented with retrospective effect from December 16.

 Air force sources said about 1,900 of the service?s 25,000 officers were promoted today. They were mostly officers between the ranks of flight lieutenant and wing commander.

 As a result of the new policy, it will now take a commissioned officer a minimum of 13 years to achieve the rank of wing commander (four years from squadron leader). Earlier, it took about 17 years. A group captain would have 17 years of commissioned service (earlier about 20 years). The experience was different in the various branches of the air force. This has now been brought on a par.

 In the navy, more than 1,000 officers will be promoted to higher ranks. There are about 6,000 officers. The order for the navy does not cover the medical and dental branches. 

 An officer in the navy is commissioned at the rank of sub lieutenant. The next higher rank (lieutenant) will now be achieved after two years. A lieutenant commander will have four years of commissioned service, a commander 11 years from the date of promotion to sub lieutenant and a captain on the time scale will have 26 years of ?reckonable commissioned service?.

 A captain?s emoluments will be in the pay scale Rs 15,100-450-17,350 and will have add-ons like rank pay, allowances and perks. The age of superannuation for captains on the time scale will be 54 years.

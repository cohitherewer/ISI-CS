 UK rule model for doctors

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: A doctor cannot be sent to jail just because he failed to show the highest professional skill. But he can be if he fails to do what any ordinarily prudent and reasonable doctor would have done.

 Holding up this judgment of a British court (Bolams case, 1957) as the standard, the Supreme Court today laid down, for the first time in India, a clear criterion to decide criminal negligence by a physician or surgeon.

 It is not possible for every professional to possess the highest level of expertise or skills in that branch which he practises?. That cannot be made the basis or the yardstick, a three-judge bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices G.P. Mathur and P.K. Balasubramanyan said.

 It must be shown that the accused did something or failed to do something which, in the given facts and circumstances, no medical professional in his ordinary senses and prudence would have done or failed to do.

 Hence, the test for determining medical negligence as laid down in the UKs Bolams case holds good in its applicability in India.

 The court said that when someone lodges an FIR against a doctor in a negligence case, police should take the opinion of a medical expert before proceeding against him. 

 The judgment ends a controversy that has preoccupied the nations highest court for over two years.

 In a case against a certain Dr Suresh Gupta, a division bench had ruled that the alleged negligence in criminal cases ? as opposed to civil negligence cases where a doctor may be asked to pay compensation but cannot be jailed ? must be gross.

 But another division bench disagreed on the ground that the IPC provisions dealing with criminal negligence didnt contain the word gross.

 When another criminal negligence case, involving a Dr Jacob Mathew, came up last year, it was referred to a larger, three-judge bench. The larger bench today said negligence in criminal cases must indeed be of a very high order and the word gross, though not mentioned in the IPC provisions, should be read into them.

 The court quashed criminal proceedings against Mathew, whose patient had been given an empty oxygen cylinder at a hospital. The court ruled that this was not the doctors fault, and the complainants may or may not move against the hospital.

 When the charge of negligence arises out of failure to use some particular equipment, the charge would fall (collapse) if the equipment was not generally available at the time of the incident, it observed.

 In the case of Mathews patient, the cylinder was empty and the hospital did not have a replacement.

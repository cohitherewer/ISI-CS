 Law trouble for MLA duo

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, March 18: A picture which looked rosy after victory in the Assembly elections turned dismal for Surendra Prasad Yadav and Rajendra Yadav, both Rashtriya Janata (RJD) MLAs from Gaya district, within days.

 Imposition of President?s rule has added to their woes as the two leaders prepare for a protracted battle with the law, in jail and outside it.

 While Surendra Prasad languishes in Gaya Central Jail after the rejection of his bail petition by the Supreme Court on March 11, police are on the lookout for Rajendra, who is wanted for murder.

 Rajendra, the RJD legislator from Atri, allegedly gunned down a girl during a clash between his supporters and opponents about two weeks ago. 

 For Surendra Prasad, who represents Belaganj in the Assembly, change in the RJD?s fortunes means he will not be able to enjoy the facilities he had taken for granted. He is in jail in connection with a 15-year-old assault case. 

 Legal experts say Surendra Prasad?s fate will depend on the deposition of witnesses, particularly Jay Kumar Palit, the complainant.

 On the other hand, observers feel Rajendra has ?exhausted? his share of good luck. Had it not been for the prompt intervention of then subdivisional officer of Gaya, Rai Madan Kishore, he would have been roasted alive during an alleged house-grabbing adventure in the Panchaiti Akhara locality of the town a few years ago. 

 But in the changed scenario, Rajendra cannot expect much help from the official machinery. According to a senior lawyer of Patna High Court, the charges are ?quite serious? and if arrested, it will be difficult for the MLA to get bail.

 Army tie-up with China

 New Delhi, May 26: Indian army chief General J.J. Singh today said joint exercises and wider military-to-military relations with China are on the cards after the visit of the chief of general staff of Chinas Peoples Liberation Army, General Liang Guanglie, to New Delhi this week, reports our special correspondent.

 General Singh said there were indications in his talks with General Liang that the land forces of the two countries could begin to explore a strategic dimension in their relationship.

 The two chiefs talked of joint exercises in counter-insurgency and peacekeeping. This flowed from confidence-building measures along the Line of Actual Control that are being institutionalised.

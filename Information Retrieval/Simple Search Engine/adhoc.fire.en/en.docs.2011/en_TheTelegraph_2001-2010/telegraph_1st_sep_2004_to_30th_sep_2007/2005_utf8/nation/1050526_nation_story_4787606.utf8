 Aussie heat on Indian Dr Death

 Sydney, May 25 (Reuters): A doctor turned off a womans life-support ventilator in an Australian hospital because the director of surgery, dubbed Dr Death, wanted her bed to operate on another patient, an inquiry has heard.

 The government-sanctioned inquiry in Queensland is examining the deaths of 87 patients treated by Indian-trained Dr Jayant Patel.

 Patel was director of surgery at Queenslands regional Bundaberg Hospital in 2003-04, despite negligence findings against him in two US states that resulted in restrictions on his US medical licence.

 Patel left Australia in March. His whereabouts are unknown.

 Bundaberg Hospitals head intensive care nurse, Toni Hoffman, told the inquiry in Brisbane yesterday that hospital staff had tried to hide patients from Patel, whom they nicknamed Dr Death because of his botched surgeries.

 All the nurses in intensive care were seeing these patients dying every day and we couldnt do anything, Hoffman told the inquiry. Wed taken to hiding patients. We just thought what on earth can we do to stop this man, she said.

 Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, who set up the inquiry, has written an open letter to Patel asking him to return to Australia to answer the allegations against him.

 On behalf of the Queenslanders who allege that you have harmed them or their loved ones, I ask you to come forward immediately... Beattie said in the letter posted on his website.

 Hoffman said the pivotal case for her occurred in July 2004, when Patel blocked the transfer to another hospital of a 55-year-old man who was critically ill with chest injuries.

 She said another nurse had told her she had seen Patel trying to drain blood in a stabbing motion from his heart, using a needle some 50 times. The man died that night after Patel told his family that he was not critically ill.

 Another case involved a woman who had suffered a serious head injury. Hoffman said Patel had ordered her life-support ventilator turned off because he wanted to use her bed for surgery.

 She said no formal tests were performed to determine whether the patient was already brain-dead, although another nurse said she was most probably brain-dead. The other patient operated on by Patel bled to death after his jugular was cut.

 Hoffman said death certificates were falsified and patients were refused transfers to other hospitals to cover up botched treatment and surgery, adding that Patel was also known as Dr E coli, referring to the high number of his patients with infections.

 The inquiry continues.

 What was going on was totally and utterly illegal, she said.

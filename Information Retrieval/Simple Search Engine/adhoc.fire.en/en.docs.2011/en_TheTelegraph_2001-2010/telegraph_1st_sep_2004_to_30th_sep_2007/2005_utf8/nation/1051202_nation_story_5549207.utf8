 Dec. 1: Doctors have not said yet how many days Amitabh Bachchan is expected to be confined to bed.

 But the showbiz industry ? expecting a minimum 10-day stay in the hospital, followed by at least a month at home ? has started reworking schedules.

 The first to feel the impact will be Kaun Banega Crorepati 2. The STAR Plus show will go off the air from December 23.

 Says Deepak Segal, executive vice-president, content, STAR India: Our episode bank will run out and well have to take KBC off or maybe telecast old episodes in the 9 pm slot from Friday to Sunday. The show can return once Mr Bachchan is fit. More than the show, its important for us that he comes back.

 Once the 85-episode contract with Bachchan is over ? the first episode since his hospitalisation goes on air tomorrow at 9 pm ? STAR also has plans to produce a stipulated number of KBC shows every season. 

 The high-profile quizmaster had agreed to a KBC 3, too. Let STAR come with the fresh contract next year and we can look into it, Bachchan had told The Telegraph last week. That, of course, will have to wait a while.

 If the countrys general knowledge classes will take a break, the busy winter schedules of brand endorsements will also be frozen. Boro Plus, Dabur Chyawanprash, Reid amp; Taylor and Cadbury are some of the brands endorsed by Bachchan.

 Fresh advertisements are usually shot just at the onset of the winter months. These products may have to do without new commercials. His other brands like Pepsi, which have summer campaigns, need not worry, says ad guru Prahlad Kakkar.

 Ironically, its the big screen projects that would suffer the least, thanks to Bachchans start-to-finish project scheduling. In recent months, he had adopted this strategy of finishing one film and only then starting another, said a source associated with AB Corp, Bachchans production company.

 His next three releases ? Apoorva Lakhias Ek Ajnabee, Raj Kumar Santoshis Family and Vidhu Vinod Chopras Eklavya ? do not require any more dates from Bachchan. But his star presence will be missed at the promotionals.

 The two big scheduling upsets would be Ravi Chopras Babul and Karan Johars Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. Babul, co-starring Salman Khan, Rani Mukherjee and John Abraham, was slated to start from December 10. The New York leg of Johars magnum opus, co-starring a host of stars led by Shahrukh Khan and Abhishek, has been shot, but Bachchan needs to shoot for a few more days.

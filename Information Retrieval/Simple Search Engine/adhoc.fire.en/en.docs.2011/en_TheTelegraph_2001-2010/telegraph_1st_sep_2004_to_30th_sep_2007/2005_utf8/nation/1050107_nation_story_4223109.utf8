 Trauma helpline to wipe away the tears

New Delhi, Jan. 6: The tsunami roared, ravaged 

and then retreated. But the tears it let loose haven?t stopped flowing ? like 

the tears in this child?s eyes.

 To help children cope with the trauma of survival, the Centre will set up a toll-free, round-the-clock telephone service that will respond to their emergency needs. A child in need of help can dial 1098 once the helpline centres are set up.

 ?Either a child or an adult on her behalf can call the helpline,? an official in the ministry of social justice and welfare said.

 Three helpline centres will be in Nagapattinam, Salem and Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, while Pondicherry will have one. The ministry has also sought permission to allow Prayas ? an NGO working with children ? to set up a helpline and a crisis intervention centre at Port Blair. But setting up helplines in Andaman and Nicobar is a problem because the communication network has collapsed there.

 With global concern over the plight of children who have lost one or both parents, the social welfare ministry is also thinking of setting up temporary children?s homes. ?These children are the most vulnerable to exploitation, sexually or otherwise,? said a social worker.

 Rescue workers say survivors, particularly children, are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. ?We have to keep the children engaged in activity, be it painting, music, storytelling,? said Victor Paina Dath of Seeds, an NGO.

 Social justice minister Meira Kumar, who has left for a tour of tsunami-affected areas, will try to assess the situation so that her ministry can put in place schemes to help children.

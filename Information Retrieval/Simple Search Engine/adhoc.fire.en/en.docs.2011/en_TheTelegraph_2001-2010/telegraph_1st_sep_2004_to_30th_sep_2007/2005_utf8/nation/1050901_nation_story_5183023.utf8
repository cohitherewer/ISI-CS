 Sentrys death in President home

 New Delhi (PTI): A Central Industrial 

 Security Force constable, on guard at Rashtrapati Bhavan, 

 was found dead early on Wednesday. 

 Krishna Kumar, 29, had a single gunshot wound in the chest, police said. His colleagues rushed him to a nearby hospital, but the constable died on the way.

 Kumar, of the 81st battalion of the CISF, was from Chhattisgarh. He had resumed duty on Tuesday after a leave.

 Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi district) Anita Roy said while prima facie it appeared to be a case of suicide, the possibility of an accidental firing could not be ruled out.

 We cannot say anything for certain until we receive the forensic report, Roy said. The shot was apparently fired from Kumars service revolver.

 Gutka baron gets travel nod

 Mumbai (PTI): A special court hearing 

 the case of alleged nexus between gutka barons with the 

 underworld on Wednesday allowed Rasiklal Dhariwal, owner 

 of the Manikchand brand, to travel abroad.

 The court, however, restrained Dhariwal, a suspect in the case, from going to Abu Dhabi and Karachi. He was asked to submit a personal bond of Rs 1 crore.

 The court also asked Dhariwal to provide all details regarding his travel to the investigation officer. 

 Bombay High Court had earlier granted an interim stay on a special courts order seeking to make Dhariwal an accused in the case. The court had held that there was prima facie evidence to show that Dhariwal and J.M. Joshi, Goa Gutka owner, had links with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.

 Beggar elected 

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): A beggar, who contested 

 elections to the Khai Kheri village panchayat in Uttar Pradesh, 

 has been elected gram pradhan (village headman).

 Villagers collected money for 35-year-old Dharamvir to contest the polls. I will try to get more funds (for the village) by begging from the government, he said. 

 Flight grounded

 Chennai (PTI): A passenger went into 

 labour mid-air, forcing a London-bound Malaysian Airlines 

 flight from Kuala Lumpur make an emergency landing at Chennai 

 airport early on Wednesday morning. Kalavani, who was travelling 

 with her husband, was taken to a nursing home in the city. 

 Taj Mahotsav

 Lucknow (PTI): The yearlong Taj Mahotsav 

 in Uttar Pradesh will come to an end with a three-day grand 

 finale in Agra beginning September 25. The function will 

 be held on the Madhavgarh lawns near the Agra Fort from 

 where Mughal emperor Shah Jahan used to view the Taj. 

 In the run-up to the EU-India summit next week, the European Union is hosting a cultural festival in New Delhi in which 21 countries will take part. It will also be held in Mumbai and Chennai.

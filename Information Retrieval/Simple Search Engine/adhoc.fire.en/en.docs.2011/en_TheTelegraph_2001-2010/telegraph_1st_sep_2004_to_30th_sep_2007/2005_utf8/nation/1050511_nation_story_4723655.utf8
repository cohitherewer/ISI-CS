 Mirwaiz quit offer for unity 

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar May 10: Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, the chairman of the moderate faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, has offered to step down if that aids a reunion between the two camps of the separatist body.

 ?I am ready to step down if that helps unity. But the other group must also respond positively,? the Mirwaiz told a news conference today at the Rajbagh headquarters during the conclusion of a two-day joint session of the executive committee and the general council.

 ?Shortly, we hope to convene meetings with the Geelani-led APHC group so that the concerns of the two sides are discussed in detail and a joint constitution is deliberated upon,? the Hurriyat leader said. 

 Ali Shah Geelani leads the hardline faction of the separatist conglomerate.

 The Mirwaiz said there would be ?deliberations on the new constitution followed by meeting of the two general councils?.

 The efforts to unite the two factions were launched after Pakistan President Pervez Musharrafs visit to India last month. 

 During the visit, Musharraf had criticised the Hurriyat leaders. In a briefing for the Pakistani media just before leaving Delhi, he showed his impatience with the separatists and asked them use their ?brains? and join the dialogue.

 He, however, mentioned the Mirwaiz, along with PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, as the top three among future leaders of Kashmir.

 Feelers to PM

 The Hurriyat has sent some feelers for talks to the government, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told reporters on his flight back from Moscow.

 He said his government was willing to talk to the Hurriyat or anybody else ?if they shun the path of violence?.

 ?I have received certain feelers that they want to talk. I repeat it publicly that our doors are open for discussion with all segments of the public opinion ? that represented in the electoral process in J amp;K and also those who are outside the political process,? the Prime Minister said.

 UPA: Rethink raj

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: After rollback NDA, rethink UPA.

 The label seemed to stick firmer than ever today as the Prime Minister backtracked from his partys initial stand and pledged before Parliament to re-examine the cases against Congress leaders named in the Nanavati Commission report.

 The Congress-led government had on Monday decided to let off Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar as it tabled the commissions report on the 1984 Sikh killings in Delhi as well as the action taken report (ATR) on it.

 Todays climbdown strengthened two perceptions about the Centre.

 One, that if the A.B. Vajpayee regime had a penchant for rolling back economic decisions, the Manmohan Singh ministry functions on second thoughts.

 Two, faced with political standoffs involving the allies and the Opposition, the government has lacked firmness and clarity of judgement.

 On Monday, a preening Congress had seemed confident of riding any political controversy over its decision not to act against Tytler and Sajjan.

 This was because the BJP, wary of what the Nanavati-Shah Commission might have to say about the Gujarat riots, had fumbled for a response. Apart from a perfunctory demand for Singhs head, the party had said little.

 The Left was equally lukewarm and said it would study the report before taking a stand.

 As the media questioned the ATR, the Left and the BJP woke up to their mistake and went for the jugular on Tuesday.

 The Left highlighted the impropriety of allowing Tytler to continue as a minister and asked why no action was taken despite the body of evidence against him. The BJP played up Singhs Sikh identity and his inability to stand up to Sonia Gandhi and her party.

 Government sources said the Prime Minister could not possibly let himself be pulverised by a rejuvenated BJP and badgered by the Left during the remaining two weeks of the monsoon session.

 By Tuesday night, it was clear that the governments decision to allow a debate on an adjournment notice served by the Opposition alliance was not enough and that a stronger political signal was required. Singh then convinced the Congresss crisis-management group that the Centre needed to change its stand.

 Singhs handling of the Jharkhand standoff had been similar. The Prime Minister had allowed the Congresss trouble-shooters to install a minority government headed by Shibu Soren, whom Singh had had to drop from the cabinet after he was charge-sheeted in an old riot case. The claim of the Nationalist Democratic Alliance, which had the numbers, was ignored.

 After a public outcry and interventions by the President and the Supreme Court, Singh and Sonia had Soren removed and allowed an NDA government to be formed.

 If these two issues involved the Opposition as much as the Left, there were others on which the government had seemed confident of bringing the Left on board only to be proved wrong.

 A recent instance has been the governments decision to sell 10 per cent of its stakes in Bhel. After the Left protested, saying no navratna PSU could be divested, the Centre thought it could negotiate the percentage and win over its ally. Singh was keen to resolve the issue before his US trip. But the Left stood firm.

 The other milestones on Singhs pro-reforms blueprint ? the insurance and pension bills ? have not made headway because of the Lefts opposition.

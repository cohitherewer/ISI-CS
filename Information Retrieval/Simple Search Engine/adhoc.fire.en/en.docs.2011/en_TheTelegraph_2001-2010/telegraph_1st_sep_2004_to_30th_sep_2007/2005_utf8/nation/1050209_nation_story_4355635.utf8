 Boy fakes snatch to skip test

 Chennai (PTI): A 15-year-old schoolboy, 

 who claimed that he was ?abducted?, was found to have made 

 up the story to escape facing a school test.

 The boy, a student of Class X, was sent back home after a stern warning, police said.

 The boy had made a verbal complaint that he was abducted by a four-member gang in front of his school. He said he was released a few kilometres from his institution when the gang realised that he was not their quarry. 

 The police said they arrived at the truth after looking into the complaint and talking to the boy?s parents. 

 The hoax kidnapping comes in the wake of a spate of abductions from Delhi to Bengal in the past few weeks that creased the brows of parents and almost rocked Laloo Prasad Yadav?s election campaign in Bihar, the state worst hit by ransom gangs. 

 Students had rallied for Kislay, a Class IX student of DPS, Patna, kidnapped from near his house and the anger boiled over as Laloo Prasad refused to meet them during a campaign visit. 

 But the most intriguing vein in the spate has been the faking of abductions, like the Chennai boy. In Bengal, a girl has been arrested for staging a snatch with her paramour and telling the family not to contact the police but marry them off.

 Death for Indian drug courier

 Jakarta (AFP): An Indonesian court on 

 Monday sentenced to death a Brazilian and an Indian for 

 drug trafficking, the Kompas newspaper reported.

 The state district court in Tanggerang of Banten province found Gurdip Singh, alias Dishal, 38, guilty of acting as a courier in an attempt to smuggle 300 gm of heroin into the country last August.

 Singh said he would appeal against the judgment. The prosecutors had recommended a 20-year jail sentence for Singh. 

 Singh was caught with the heroin in two small packets inside his socks during a check at Jakarta?s Sukarno-Hatta International Airport on August 28, 2004. Singh later told police he was paid $2,000 by a Pakistani to smuggle the heroin. 

 Poet?s tomb vandalised

 New Delhi (PTI): The tomb of poet Amir 

 Khusro in south Delhi was vandalised and a person detained 

 in this connection.

 Mohammad Bakul Khan, a rice merchant from Malda, entered the tomb premises and allegedly broke a glass pane and light fittings. He also damaged part of a cement fence outside the tomb. He was remanded in judicial custody. Police said the man seemed to be in a ?hysterical state?.

 Bomb hoax

 Kanhangad (PTI): Panic spread at the 

 Hosdurg assistant sessions court in Kerala following an 

 anonymous call that a bomb was planted there. The call proved 

 to be a hoax after no explosive material was found by a 

 joint team of police and special bomb squad. Court officials 

 received a call at 10 am saying the bomb would explode at 

 noon.

 Rape accused

 Sonepat (PTI): Two persons were arrested 

 in separate cases of alleged rape, police said. Rajinder 

 of Gorar village allegedly raped his 18-year-old daughter-in-law 

 last week. Sonu of Guhna village is accused of abducting 

 and raping a married woman of a Sonepat colony last week. 

 Councillor killed

 Srinagar (PTI): The newly elected 

 councillor and chairman-designate of Beerwah municipal committee, 

 Ghulam Mohiuddin Mir, of the People?s Democratic Party,

 High court judge to head probe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 26: Haryana chief minister B.S. Hooda has agreed to order a judicial probe into the Gurgaon violence under pressure from the Congress and the Left parties.

 Left leaders will be meeting Union home minister Shivraj Patil tomorrow. They are demanding immediate suspension of the Gurgaon district commissioner, senior superintendent of police and other officials alleged to be involved in the violence.

 The Left said tough action should be taken as the police today allegedly beat up relatives of workers enquiring about their whereabouts. It is also questioning how impartial the probe will be if the officials are not dismissed.

 The CPI is not happy the probe will be headed by a retired Haryana High Court judge. It wants the matter to be handed to a Supreme Court judge. 

 The Centre is in a spot because of a controversial statement Patil made in the Lok Sabha. He claimed only 92 workers were injured yesterday.

 When the Opposition shouted him down for giving a ridiculously low estimate, he said Haryana had decided on a magisterial probe. This kicked up a storm, ending in a walkout by the Left and the NDA.

 The National Human Rights Commission has asked the state government to take effective steps to ensure an independent probe, preferably by the CBI. It appears the policemen were not so much interested in dispersing the mob as to thrash the workers black and blue by encircling them, it observed.

 Transit plea on UN date

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Musharraf

 Kabul, Aug. 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will urge Pakistans President General Pervez Musharraf to consider granting transit rights to India and Afghanistan. 

 The Prime Minister today said he was meeting Musharraf on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York on September 14.

 In talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai yesterday, the shadow of Pakistans denial of trade and transit rights across its territory figured large. Indian assistance to Afghanistan is now pledged at $550 million and much of the aid has to be routed through the Iranian port of Bandarabbas.

 In October, India will begin construction of a 220-km power transmission line for which thousands of tonnes of equipment ? mainly huge steel towers ? need to be sent to Afghanistan. 

 The Prime Minister pointed out that Karzai was also talking to the Pakistani leadership. However, he did not hold out great hopes of a breakthrough in the short term.

 Asked if Pakistan was holding India-Afghanistan relations hostage, he said: I will not use such strong words. The real issue is to persuade Pakistan. We have to induce Pakistan to fall in line. It is a certainty that India-Afghanistan relations will further improve if Pakistan is on board.

 Singh said he had had comprehensive talks on all issues concerning India-Afghanistan bilateral relations with President Karzai. He said there was a broad convergence of views on most issues.

 I have always been fascinated by Afghanistan. As a child, I had come here. This has been for me a voyage of rediscovery, Singh said.

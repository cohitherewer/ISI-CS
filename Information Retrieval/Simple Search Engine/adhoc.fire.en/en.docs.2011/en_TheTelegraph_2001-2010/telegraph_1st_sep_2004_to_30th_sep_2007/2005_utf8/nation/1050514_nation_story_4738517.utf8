 Laloo Prasad 

Lucknow, May 13: As at home, so in office ? Friday the 13th hit railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav hard.

 His suspension of a North Central Railway official for standing up to a group of RJD leaders and their lawless supporters today sparked a virtual revolt among employees, who paralysed the Allahabad-Kanpur section for nearly four hours.

 The agitators shouted slogans against their minister, accusing him of trying to import Bihari goondaism into Uttar Pradesh.

 The strike prompted Railway Board chairman R.K. Singh, after talks with Laloo Prasad, to promise to try and get the suspension of additional divisional railway manager (ADRM) A.K. Singh revoked. But till 5 pm, it wasnt clear whether the strike had ended.

 The chaos at Allahabad came on a day of embarrassment for Laloo Prasad in Patna, where four RJD leaders ? including two of his brothers-in-law (both MPs) and two Union ministers ? were evicted from illegally-occupied government bungalows.

 At the root of the trouble on the tracks was another group of RJD MPs ? Raghunath Jha, Devendra Yadav and Magnilal Mandal ? who were travelling on the Rajdhani Express on the night of April 29 when they ran into Singh at Kanpur station.

 Jhas supporters beat up railway staff on being asked to show their tickets, prompting Singh to climb on to the coach and order the crowd of ticketless men off the train.

 Singh, transferred to Varanasi after the incident, was suspended today for carrying out an inspection at a late hour and allowing the media to enter the compartment.

 The news reached the staff at Allahabad station around 1.30 pm. They immediately switched off power and the signalling system, closed the ticket and enquiry counters and gheraoed senior officers. Passengers on the platform and in the trains hit back by ransacking the station.

 At least 20 trains, including the Jodhpur Howrah Express and Sealdah Express, were stranded in the Rura-Mughalsarai section as the staff turned off the control system.

 Let the railway minister come and talk to us, said an employee.

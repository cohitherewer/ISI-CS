 Change in cop system

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 19: The commissionerate system of policing will soon be introduced in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.

 Addressing the 51st annual Senior Police Officers? Conference in Cuttack, chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Sunday assured that the new system will change the police set-up for the better and bring different sections of the force under a unified professional command. 

 In November last year, the Orissa Assembly had passed the Urban Police Bill, paving the way for the commisionerate system. Under the new system, a police officer of the rank of inspector-general or additional director-general will take over as police commissioner of both Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. 

 The commissioner will have the powers of an executive magistrate and a district magistrate rolled into one under the Code of Criminal Procedure. 

 The Bill, formulated on the lines of Delhi Police Act, provided for an additional commissioner and several deputy commissioners in the two cities. The deputy commissioners will be in charge of the police districts. One or more additional deputy commissioners will assist the deputy commissioners.

 Speaking on the occasion, state director-general of police Bipin Bihari Mishra expressed concern over the huge backlog of cases and low rate of conviction. 

 Stating that there was a need to improve the intelligence network in the state to maintain proper records of criminals, the DGP added that investigation could be improved through the use of scientific tools and methods. 

 Mishra asked the officials present in the meeting to uphold human rights and act in a friendly manner, besides advising them to refrain from custodial violence. He also instructed them to ensure organisational discipline.

 Senior police officials stressed the need for more administrative and investigative powers for constables during the conference.

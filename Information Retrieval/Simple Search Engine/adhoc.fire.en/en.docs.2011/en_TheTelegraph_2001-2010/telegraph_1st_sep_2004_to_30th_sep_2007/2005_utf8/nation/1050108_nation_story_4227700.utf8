 Govt in power fight

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 7: In a bid to prevent the pilferage of electricity, the Naveen Patnaik government has decided to set up 29 power police stations (PPS) and eight special courts in the state. There are only five such police stations in Orissa at present. 

 The decision to open the new energy police stations was taken at a meeting presided by state energy minister Suryo Patro yesterday. The five existing police stations are at Balasore, Berhampur, Khurda, Cuttack and Sambalpur. 

 Once the plan materialises, 30 police districts will have a PPS each while Rourkela and Ganjam will have two each. Every PPS will have a circle inspector, two assistant sub-inspectors, 15 constables and a driver at its disposal. 

 The meeting also decided to create the post of inspector-general of police and nine posts of deputy superintendents of police (DSP) to monitor the power police stations. Two DSPs will be in charge of each distribution company while one will be attached to the IG?s office. 

 The offices of the special IG of police and DSP will be under the administrative control of the energy department. However, the power police stations will be under the administrative control of the respective superintendents of police.

 On the issue of recruitment, the minister said there is a shortage of police officers of the rank of circle inspector. The meeting decided that retired inspectors, ASIs and constables will be appointed on contract basis for two years and during this time fresh recruitment will be made by the state police. 

 However, a final decision will be taken after discussions are held with the state finance department.

 Yesterday?s meeting also decided to increase the licence fee of the four distribution companies to meet the salary and establishment cost of these police stations. 

 At present, the distribution companies are charged an annual licence fee of Rs 50 lakh each. This is likely to be increased to Rs 2 crore, Patro said, adding that the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission will be requested to issue an order to this effect. 

 The annual budget requirement of the special police stations has been estimated at Rs 6.5 crore.

 Director-general of police (CID) Suchit Das, home secretary Santosh Kumar, energy secretary R.N. Bohidar, law secretary D.K. Sahu and other senior officials were present in the meeting.

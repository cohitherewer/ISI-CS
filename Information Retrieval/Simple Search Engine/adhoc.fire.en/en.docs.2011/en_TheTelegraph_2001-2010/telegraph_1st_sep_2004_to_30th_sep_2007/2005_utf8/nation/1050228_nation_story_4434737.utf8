 Security push to US centre shift

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: A famous New Delhi landmark, the American Information Center, is gearing up to move from the heart of the city ? Kasturba Gandhi Marg ? in view of the heightened security threat perception following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 

 Of the four American Centers, the New Delhi chapter is among the most frequented institutions of the US government despite the increased security following terrorist threats. However, according to Delhi police sources, the institution is planning to move to a ?better secured location? in the next one year. 

 The vulnerability of the centre was highlighted after a terrorist attack on the American Center in Calcutta killed four people on January 22, 2002. Prior to 9/11, Abdel Raouf Hawash, a Sudanese, and his Indian accomplice were arrested in Delhi on June 16, 2001, for an unsuccessful bid to blow up the embassy. 

 The US embassy is working out a relocation strategy. ?The US embassy is re-evaluating its long-term facilities and plans for India but no decisions have been taken,? a spokesperson said.

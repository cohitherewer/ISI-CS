 Buddha wins a referendum 

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 A battle to save old industries in Bengals rust belt, and the call of a new industrial policy aggressively advocated by a reform-loving, Marxist chief minister. A raging political controversy over the new-age Salim project and a quiet end to the state-owned Great Eastern Hotel.

 Such was the political setting for the by-election to the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency. The campaign made it almost a referendum on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees recipe for Bengals re-industrialisation and also on the CPMs apparently conflicting positions on new and old industries. To add to the importance of Asansol, the Election Commissions new directives and tough actions made it an unprecedented test for the Left Front.

 Asansol has never been a rural constituency. Even so, the Trinamul Congress made the Salim projects a major campaign issue. Its appeal there was not directly to the farmers, who form a small minority of the electorate. Mamata Banerjees accusation that the CPM was now prepared to take away poor farmers land in order to woo capitalists would make little sense in Asansol. But she cited the Salim proposals to oppose Bhattacharjees new industrialisation drive.

 The CPM today, she told the people in Asansol, was no longer the party that stood by workers and farmers. For her, both the place and the time were wrong. 

 The UPA governments decision to revive Iisco by merging it with SAIL may not have benefited a weak Congress, but the CPM appropriated all the credit for it. The voters clearly saw the Left as the only hope for keeping old industries alive ? be it Iisco at Burnpur and Kulti or the coal mines in Ranigunj and Jamuria. Although it had always been a CPM stronghold, the partys influence had waned when the industries fell sick or faced the threat of closure. But, since the Left now can influence the policies in New Delhi, the industrial workers once again rallied to their old party.

 The massive margin of victory for the CPM candidate, Bansagopal Chowdhury, showed that the voters rejected Mamatas stand on both old and new industries. In other words, they endorsed the chief ministers new policies along with the CPMs campaign on old units. It appears that the Left has also gained considerable support among the middle classes.

 The margin is, however, explained also by the fact that the Trinamul is increasingly seen as a loser. The partys vote share in the constituency has dropped consistently from 41.63 per cent in 1999 to 33.85 per cent in 2004 and to 27 per cent this time. By contrast, the CPMs share rose from 46.27 per cent in 1999 to 51 per cent in 2004 and to 61.33 per cent now. The party won comfortably in all the seven Assembly segments.

 If the Trinamul won three seats within the Asansol constituency in the 2001 Assembly elections, that was largely because of a combination of the voters despair with the Left at that time and a corresponding hope for the Trinamul. With the NDA government defeated and the Trinamul reduced to just one Lok Sabha seat from the state, Mamata is no longer seen as a winner. The CPM used the changes in the national political scene not only to push its own wish list with the UPA government, but also to strengthen its organisation and win back much of the lost support.

 It is not as if the CPM leadership had any doubts about winning Asansol. But it certainly was anxious how the ECs stringent measures would impact on its electoral strategy. Even if the CPMs winning margin dropped drastically from what it had been last time, it would have strengthened the Oppositions old charge that the Marxists have stayed in power in Bengal only through rigged polls. It may still be too early to know how the different areas actually voted or whether the polls were as free and fair as the EC sought to make them.

 But, going by the measures the EC had taken, all parties and most people agree that Asansol was the most closely monitored election in Bengal during the Lefts long reign. Digital and video cameras inside booths, central forces, eight EC observers, including one for the poll finances, and almost 80 per cent of the polling staff drawn from central government employees ? the EC tried its best to minimise the states, and the CPMs, interference with the polls. No exceptions were made even for the chief ministers security requirements. Such were the ECs controls that the Left Front cried foul and accused the EC of helping the Trinamul candidate.

 Coming only a few months before next years Assembly polls, Asansol shows which way the political wind is blowing in Bengal, at least for now. But then, every election in India is a different season.

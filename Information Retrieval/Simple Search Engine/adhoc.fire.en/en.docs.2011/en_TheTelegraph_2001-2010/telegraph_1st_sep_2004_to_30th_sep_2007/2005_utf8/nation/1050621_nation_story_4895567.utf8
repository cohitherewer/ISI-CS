 Debate plea on tainted ministers

 New Delhi (PTI): A petition filed in 

 the Supreme Court on Monday has accused the Centre of failing 

 to initiate the promised debate in Parliament 

 on the inclusion of tainted ministers and sought adjudication 

 of the issue on merit.

 The apex court had, on February 18, dismissed a review petition filed by one Manoj Narula alleging that the inclusion of tainted ministers breached the terms of oath given in the Schedule III of the Constitution.

 The petition was dismissed after the Centre assured the court reiterating Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement that it would initiate a debate in Parliament on the issue of inclusion of tainted persons in the Union council of ministers.

 Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati, appearing for the Union government, had told a three-judge bench that the issue was clearly within the domain of Parliament to discuss and debate and not for the courts to decide.

 The new petition has challenged the inclusion of Laloo Prasad Yadav, Jai Prakash Yadav, M.A.A. Fatmi and Mohammad Taslimuddin in the Union ministry, saying ministers are required to carry out important constitutional functions and hence, they should be of impeccable integrity.

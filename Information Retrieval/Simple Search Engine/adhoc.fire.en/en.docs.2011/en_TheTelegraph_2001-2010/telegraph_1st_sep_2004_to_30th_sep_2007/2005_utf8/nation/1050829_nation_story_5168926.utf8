 Spendthrift wife has legs hacked

 hyderabad: 

 A farmer chopped off both the legs of his wife while she 

 slept, accusing her of being a spendthrift, reports our 

 special correspondent.

 Syed Fakruddin of Andhra Pradesh, who worked on a sheep farm in Kuwait, returned last week to find that his wife, Sadiquin Begam, had spent all the Rs 4 lakh that he had sent on jewellery and clothes.

 A furious Fakruddin bought an axe on Wednesday, while returning to his home in Anantpur district and hacked the legs of his wife while she slept. Fakruddin then rushed Sadiquin to a government hospital, where the limbs had to be amputated.

 The police dropped the case registered against the farmer when he surrendered the next day as Sadiquin did not want any action taken. Sadiquin said Fakruddin had repented when he learnt that the clothes and the jewellery had been bought for their daughters wedding, adding that she could not live without him.

 SIM card leads to Bihar fugitive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Searching for clues at Paharganjs blast-ravaged 6 Tooti Chowk market, the police had chanced upon a SIM card. It was unrelated to the terrorists but has helped them catch a murder accused on the run.

 Arvind Pandey, a Bihar government official accused in a murder in Patna and an extortion case in Begusarai, was staying at a cheap Paharganj hotel. Around 5 pm on Saturday, he left his room for some urgent shopping.

 When the bomb went off, Pandey was far enough from the spot to escape with minor injuries. But the impact hurled him a few yards away and knocked his mobile phone out of his hand. Amid the chaos, Pandey searched for it in the rubble for a while before deciding that getting hospital treatment was more important.

 The mobile got burnt but the SIM card was intact. The police officers first reaction was that it could belong to the terrorists; so they immediately started scanning it. Intrigued by the SIM card having a Bihar number, they began tracing the calls made through it.

 After six hours of scanning calls and police records, the sleuths established the identity of its owner but still had no idea that he was a murder accused and a fugitive.

 The police began a hunt for Pandey and located him at a hospital. During interrogation, afraid of being mistaken as a terrorist, the fugitive allegedly confessed his crime.

 A Bihar police team has arrived in Delhi and will be taking the surprise catch back to his home state tomorrow.

 ITs out: Indians better than British

 AMIT ROY

 London, Dec. 26: India is able to outsource IT workers to Britain because they are better educated and generally superior to locally available British staff, it was revealed today.

 One senior UK onshore offshoring source let the cat out of the bag by telling The Daily Telegraph in London: The real reason why companies are turning to people from the Indian subcontinent is that UK graduates cant compete with the quality of Indias technology graduates. The level of intelligence and attention to detail is lacking in UK staff coming through the education system.

 The government is aware of the growing crisis in schools and universities caused by the reluctance of pupils to take up science subjects such as physics, chemistry and mathematics in favour of soft options such as media or cultural studies. 

 It helps that Indian workers are prepared to work in the UK in some cases for a lot less money than what is paid to equivalent British staff.

 Figures show that of the foreign IT workers allowed by the British government to come into the UK, more than eight out of 10 are from India.

 The top five countries of origin of IT workers coming to the UK are India (85 per cent), the US (5 per cent), Australia (2 per cent), South Africa (2 per cent) and Canada (1 per cent). The figures show that Britain is now heavily dependent on Indian staff, says the Association of Technology Staffing Companies.

 The organisations chief executive, Ann Swain, said: The transfer of jobs between the UK and India is now very much two-way traffic. The irony is that while low-skilled IT jobs continue to be shipped to India, highly skilled Indian IT professionals are coming to the UK to take up managerial jobs.

 Swain said qualifications currently lacking in the UK are more easily available in India. IT people coming from India are highly proficient in mathematics, she said.

 The white-collar unions, who have long opposed offshoring, like inshoring even less.

 David Fleming, the Amicus national secretary for finance, has told The Daily Telegraph that the UK could be left as a nation of fat cats and hairdressers, with nothing in between if the offshoring of back office jobs and manufacturing continues. Deloitte Consultancy has predicted that 2 million jobs currently based in western economies will go to India by 2008.

 According to industry sources, most consulting companies offer some form of onshore offshoring. IBM, LogicaCMG, Accenture and CapGemini all transfer Indian workers to the UK for projects, as do Indian consulting firms Tata Consulting Services and Infosys.

 Research from PayScale, a pay monitoring firm, shows that an experienced software programmer in India receives ?6,600 a year compared with ?33,000 for his counterpart in the UK.

 However, when Indian workers come to the UK, the wage gap is greatly narrowed, according to industry sources. Even so, Indian workers may be undercutting their British counterparts.

 After paying their travel, permits and living expenses, the Indian workers are charged out to clients at around half the rate asked for a similarly home-grown IT expert (?350 a day against ?650), Elizabeth Gordon-Pugh of outsourcing consultant Alsbridge has estimated.

 She added: One Indian supplier operating in the UK has around 80 per cent of its 2,000-plus staff in the UK comprised of Indians on assignment from a few weeks to several years.

 Some experts in the UK are predicting that wage inflation in India will reduce the practice of outsourcing and that the country could run dry of IT workers.

 Others, notably Indians, are confident that for the time being, at least, there is plenty to go around.

 Mark Kobayashi-Hillary, author of Outsourcing to India: The Off-sore Advantage and an authority on the subject, assured The Telegraph: I dont feel that we are creating a nation of hairdressers.

 Commenting on the claim that Indians are unfairly undercutting the British, he said: This is exactly the kind of scare story that ignores the big picture and chooses to focus on something where the statistics just dont even back it up. The vast majority of IT workers coming in to the UK from places such as India is people on short-term assignments. Either they are working on a process that is being transitioned offshore or their skills cannot be found locally.

 He revealed: The UK government has been undergoing a consultation exercise recently to examine how best to manage this situation. I heard it from the immigration minister, Tony McNulty, in person that he would like to allow the companies to be able to issue their own work permits, because the fact is that most companies play by the rules and bring in people on a short-term assignment because there is a genuine need for the person ? they then return when the assignment is over. The government will let the companies handle the visa process, and will only step in and start monitoring those companies who try to bend or break the rules. These proposals should be going to Parliament this year, hopefully to be on the statute book by 2007.

 He went on: There are two things I would say. Dont lose sight of the opportunities that migration allows. If Barclays or Lloyds TSB or any other local firm needs to perform a project quickly and they can augment that with expertise from overseas then that helps the British economy to be more innovative, creative and reactive to what customers want and need ? it makes our service companies perform better.

 He added: Secondly, there is a longer term issue about skills. Migration of skilled workers is becoming more common and intellectual processes can be outsourced offshore. As a nation we need to examine how best to promote life-long learning during a career and how universities can prepare young people for a future where a career in one industry might last a decade at most. This needs a joint-up approach to thinking how careers of the future will be formed, not small-minded protectionism.

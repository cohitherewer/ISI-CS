 Unlearnt lessons of school tragedy

 - No rush on fire safety, prosecution of authorities tardy

 Kumbakonam, July 10: The melting of the ice cream at the memorial to the dead is the only sign that time still moves at the Sri Krishna Primary and High School.

 A fragment from an English lesson is written across the blackboard in a ground-floor classroom of the huge, ill-ventilated building that turned into an inferno last year, killing 94 children. It goes like this:

 Q) Where did the Jackal live?

 A) The Jackal lived near a river.

 Q) What was the Jackal fond of eating?

 A) The Jackal was fond of eating crabs.

 Scribbled at one corner of the board is the line: Friday. 16/07/2004. II Standard.

 Since that Black Friday, the school has stood frozen in time, a large lock on its front door shutting out the dark, cobweb-filled rooms with soot-covered walls from the world.

 An oil lamp, incense sticks and candles continue to burn under a small, triangular stone outside, beside a pile of chocolates, biscuits and ice creams left every Friday by bereaved parents in memory of their dead children.

 The little story of the jackal and the crabs is not the only unlearnt lesson the fire has left behind.

 Almost a year on, the Kumbakonam government hospital is still waiting for the promised special high-tech burns ward. The new ward was announced by local MP and Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar who arrived at the school with Congress president Sonia Gandhi a couple of days after the tragedy.

 Aiyar had said public sector oil companies, including Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum, would provide the money.

 The site has been chosen and the PWD building plan has gone up for approval, an official source said. 

 Apparently, the oil PSUs are still undecided how much they should shell out, and so the sanction is being delayed.

 Also, while many schools across Tamil Nadu have replaced the thatched roofs of their classrooms and noon-meal centres with those made of fireproof material, many others are yet to follow suit.

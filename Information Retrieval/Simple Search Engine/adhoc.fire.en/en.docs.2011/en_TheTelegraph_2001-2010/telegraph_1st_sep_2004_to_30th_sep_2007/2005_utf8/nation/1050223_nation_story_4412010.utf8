 Patna, Feb. 22: Overcast skies, unexpected at this time of the year, have added to the uncertainties with which electors in 11 districts will exercise their franchise to select 93 members of the Assembly in the third and final round tomorrow.

 The past two days have seen light downpours in almost all poll-bound districts and the weather office has forecast a cloudy sky for tomorrow as well. 

 Chief minister Rabri Devi will try her luck from the Raghopur constituency in the adjoining Vaishali district. The ruling Rashriya Janata Dal had won 40 of the 93 seats last time, one more than the NDA?s 39.

 A large number of politicians facing criminal and other charges are also in the poll fray. The list includes Munna Shukla, Rajan Tiwari, Lalan Singh, Anant Singh and Rama Singh.

 The polls in Siwan and Gopalganj have evoked special interest because the authorities there have debarred big names like Mohammad Shahabuddin, Sadhu Yadav and Kali Pandey from entering the districts.

 The Election Commission has made extraordinary arrangements for the deployment of security personnel throughout the districts and the phasing out of the polls has helped in the concentration of the force.

 The elections in the 13 constituencies of Patna district would also be keenly watched since the BJP is trying to retain its ?bastion? within the capital and the RJD testing its luck on the rural outskirts.

 The Mokamah seat in Patna district will be in focus because two notorious names ? Lalan Singh of the Lok Janshakti Party and Anant Singh of the Janata Dal (United) ? would clash there in the presence of Shyam Sundar Dheeraj of the Congress.

 Nalanda, the stronghold of the JD(U), is also going to polls tomorrow and the contest in all eight constituencies of the district appear to be triangular. Ranjit ?Don?, an accused in the IIM paper leak scam, is the LJP?s nominee from the Hilsa seat of the district.

 The 10 seats of Saran (Chhapra) district, from where Laloo Prasad Yadav won the Lok Sabha elections against the BJP?s Rajiv Pratap Rudy, will go to polls with the RJD chief?s associate and minister Udit Rai in the fray from the town.

 In the two Champaran districts, often described as the cradle of the state?s kidnapping ?industry?, as many as 20 seats are up for grabs and all parties are locked in a keen contest in the region. 

 The Bahujan Samaj Party is believed to be a strong contender in at least two constituencies.

 The LJP will particularly test its strength in Vaishali, Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi districts because these have been the strong bases of party president Ram Vilas Paswan.

 ?Although our strongholds have already gone to polls in the earlier two phases, particularly in the second round, we will try to gain the maximum ground tomorrow as well. The party is worried about the general opinion about its slipping base in Bihar this time,? an RJD leader said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Auctioned, at festival of lust

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Peddapuram (Andhra Pradesh), Aug. 28: Fourteen-year-old Subhadra is so happy shes been traipsing around her house all morning.

 Her mother Padma has been doting on her more than usual since shes woken up ? giving her an oil bath, dressing her in new silk clothes and feeding her almonds and a glass of milk.

 Its her special day, mother has said, so Subhadra must look as pretty as she can. Mother has also given in her name for a beauty contest, which will be judged by rich and famous men. If she manages to catch their fancy, she will be given a big prize.

 So when the men trooped in to house No. 14 in Grandhivari lane of this town in East Godavari district, Subhadra turned on her charm. She preened and primped before various groups through the day, was picked the best and given a whopping Rs 51,000 in prize money. 

 Only, she didnt know she had been sold to the highest bidder ? a 38-year-old gold merchant ? who would work his lust on her that night. 

 Subhadra was one of some 20 girls who were auctioned as part of the Aashada mela ? a 34-day festival of lust held in Peddapuram every year after the monsoon sets in.

 During this festival, which begins in late July, men make a beeline for virgins because they believe sleeping with one on the first night of the month of Aashada brings wealth and physical prowess.

 But before getting into the act, they pray to Maridamma, a local deity, for wealth, health, peace and happiness. Most of all, we pray for a good woman, said Lakshman Rao, a tobacco farmer.

 Over 3,000 women are into the flesh trade in Peddapuram, where prostitution is a way of life. There are over 300 joints ? called companies in local parlance ? in this tiny 10-sq km town, which is barely 30 km from the sea. Every second house is a brothel of sorts, employing 20-30 girls.

 One such company run by Purandareshwari boasts of jacuzzis, sauna baths, a bar stocking varieties of foreign liquor and girls from 13 to 35 for the taking. Clients whiz in and out of this joint at all hours on fancy motorbikes or snazzy Mercedes Benzes. Some even hire boats to make merry.

 Satisfaction of our customers is our main goal, beamed the 38-year-old madam, who has spent nearly Rs 17 lakh to decorate the interiors of her 18-room set-up according to the latest trends.

 But there is a condition: men will have to use condoms. There are placards all over town screaming You are not welcome if you dont use condoms or Stay only if you have a condom. Companies have pink-and-black booklets listing dos and donts.

 We are in the business of entertaining people. Unless there is discipline, no one will come to us, said Bhargavi, who caters primarily to foreigners.

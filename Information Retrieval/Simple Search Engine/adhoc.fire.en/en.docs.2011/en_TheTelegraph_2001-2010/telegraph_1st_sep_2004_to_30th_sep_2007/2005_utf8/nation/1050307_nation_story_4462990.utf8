 Speaker sparks fly in row-a-day Ranchi

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi, March 6: The Raj Bhavan today walked into another storm by refusing to endorse a state government decision to nominate Ghatshila Congress MLA Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu as the pro tem Speaker of the Assembly.

 The secretariat had recommended the names of five- term Daltonganj MLA Inder Singh Namdhari of the Janata Dal (United), and the JMM legislators from Shikaripara and Littipara, Nalin Soren and Sushila Hansda, both of whom have been elected for the fourth time. However, the cabinet ignored them and forwarded the name of Balmuchu, who will have his third term.

 The governor?s house, sources said, returned the file this evening and asked the government why the names of senior MLAs recommended by the secretariat were ignored while recommending the name of Balmuchu.

 Raj Bhavan refused to comment, but sources said the query was raised after several rounds of discussions between officials in the governor?s office, who wanted the tradition of nominating the seniormost MLA as pro tem Speaker to continue.

 Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, already in a spot following his decision to invite the UPA to form the government, did not want to create a new controversy and was instead in favour of accepting the name recommended by the cabinet.

 The governor finally relented and paved the way for the file to be returned to the government, the sources added.

 They said the file was returned late tonight and was expected to be taken up by the government tomorrow. Chief secretary Prem Prakash Sharma and cabinet secretary Aditya Swarup said they had no idea if Raj Bhavan had raised any query.

 All government files sent to Raj Bhavan are routed through the chief secretary. The governor can refuse a cabinet recommendation only once, if the same recommendation is sent again, he is bound to accept. 

 UPA sources said the cabinet was in favour of nominating Balmuchu as part of the coalition?s plan to win the trust vote. ?Namdhari stood no chance of being the pro tem Speaker since he is with the NDA. That left us to choose between Soren and Hansda. But we realised that the duo would not be able to tackle the chaos in the House on that day. Balmuchu is more adept at handling such situations,? said a senior UPA leader.

 Left twins on Pak recce

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 Surjeet

 New Delhi, Feb. 23: Memory and diplomacy will mingle tomorrow when Harkishen Singh Surjeet and A.B. Bardhan leave for Pakistan on a weeklong trip.

 For CPM general secretary Surjeet, this will be his first trip to the neighbour country since Partition. His CPI counterpart, Bardhan, will be visiting Pakistan for the first time.

 The Pakistan government is virtually rolling out the red carpet for the two communist leaders who head parties that extend crucial outside support to the United Progressive Alliance government.

 Islamabad knows that the message the Left leaders send out is important because of the influence it could have on Delhi?s strategy towards Pakistan. The duo had lunch here today with Aziz Ahmed Khan, the Pakistan high commissioner.

 Just ahead of their departure tomorrow evening, they will also meet foreign minister K. Natwar Singh.

 ?We are carrying the message of peace, good neighbourliness and peaceful resolution of conflict,? Bardhan said. If all goes according to plan, the two leaders will meet Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz on Tuesday.

 The Pakistani establishment perceives the Left as doves, not warmongers, and would like it to use its influence in Delhi and among the people to improve bilateral relations.

 But diplomacy is not all there is to the trip. Surjeet and Bardhan want to visit places that will bring back memories of an undivided India and an undivided Communist Party.

 Surjeet, for instance, is keen to visit the Lahore fort jail. He is no stranger to the city that was part of undivided Punjab, the region where he cut his political teeth.

 The 87-year-old CPM leader wants to take a trip down memory lane in the jail, where in cell No. 3 he spent four months in solitary confinement in 1940 during the freedom struggle.

 Lahore is dotted with memories of Surjeet?s early underground activist days, his colleagues say, when he would shuttle between it and Jalandhar on a bicycle. He was incarcerated in three jails in Lahore.

 Surjeet and Bardhan will also visit Sahiwal, 100 km from Lahore, where the former had spent months in a jail.

 They have been invited by the Pakistan Communist Party, the Mazdoor Kisan Communist Party and the National Workers? Party.

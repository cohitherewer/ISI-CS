The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Early-start call to bust stress

 AMIT ROY

 London, Feb. 14: Working conditions in call centres in India are ?very stressful? and their employees need to be taught ?life skills? at school and college to be able to cope with the pressure, Britain?s best known psychiatrist, Dr Raj Persaud, who has just returned from India, has told The Telegraph.

 Persaud, who visited call centres just outside Delhi as part of making a programme for BBC Radio called Travels of the Mind, said: ?I was there for only a few hours and I found it stressful just being there.?

 One reason for the stress ? perhaps the main reason ? was that India?s call centres were very ?performance oriented?. The managements? solution of paying ever bigger salaries ? $300 a month was said to be a common start-up wage ? plus bonuses often did not work because employees, who had to face ?abuse? from angry callers in the US, the UK and elsewhere, also had to cope with ?emotional stress?.

 From his many conversations in India, Persaud learnt that employees who work 14-hour night shifts take pills to stay alert but later have difficulty sleeping. One husband and wife found that because of their working patterns, they could spend only 45 minutes together on a typical day and were suffering ?relationship problems?.

 One psychiatrist, Sanjay, interviewed by Persaud, wanted call centre managements to set up 24-hour helplines so that employees had access to professional help. For the outlay of ?a few thousand rupees a day?, call centres could save themselves ?millions of rupees? in the long run, it was argued.

 Surprisingly for a psychiatrist, who works for the National Health Service in Britain ? only part of his time is being taken up with high-profile media work ? Persaud?s preferred solution is not to call in psychiatrists.

 ?Personally, I am very suspicious of psychiatrists,? he commented.

 If psychiatrists were summoned, it usually meant it was already ?too late?, Persaud speculated.

 The solution in his opinion was for India to rely on its ?traditional culture? and teach children and young people how to cope with stress at school and at college.

 If Indians could demonstrate ?resilience? in being able to cope with whatever challenges the West threw at them, it would help to establish the country, with its high levels of education, as the leading economic power in the world, he said.

 Persaud was taken inside a call centre which was on a ?UK shift?, geared to working to the ?9-5 day? in Britain. The employee had been trained to speak with a neutral accent and to laugh a lot ? on the walls were posters proclaiming, ?Laughter has no foreign accent?.

 In another room, employees were being taught to say ?thank you?, with traces of the Indian accent, with its harder consonant sounds, ?scientifically removed?.

 India?s call centres are said to be bringing in business worth $5 billion a year and growing at between 50 per cent and 55 per cent a year.

 To penetrate the outward ?veneer of success?, Persaud consulted Prasanta Roy, chief editor of the Cyber media magazine group, who said: ?People have come in drawn by the glamour of the whole thing. They have very quickly come to terms with the thing that it is far from glamorous once you have got past the shiny walls and the shiny floors. There are a lot of factors like being yelled at on the phone by a lot of people from all over the world, which is beginning to take its toll. We have seen probably the highest attrition rates among all the industries in India.?

 Even when employees go to the lavatories, that counts as ?non-productive downtime?, added Roy.

 Laxmi, 40, worked in a Calcutta call centre for only a month ?before the stress got too much?. 

 ?Burnout is extremely high,? she claimed. ?One batch leaves and they get another batch because everybody wants to give it a try.?

 Persaud, who was born in Britain of parents of Indian origin who came from Guyana and Trinidad, wants Indians to find a ?holistic? solution to stress in age-old ?Indian culture?. Recourse to a psychiatrist at a late stage, he reckons, would be following a ?western model? ? and he does not approve of that.

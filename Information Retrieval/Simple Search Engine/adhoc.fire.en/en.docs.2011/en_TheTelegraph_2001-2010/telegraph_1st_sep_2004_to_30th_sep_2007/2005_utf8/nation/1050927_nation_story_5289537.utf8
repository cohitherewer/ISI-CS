 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 26: The Centre aims to de-stress the Bangalore software cluster, with the Karnataka capitals infrastructure in a poor state and the city bursting at its seams, and showcase areas such as Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

 Bangalore continued to top the software development clusters in India, but the Centre is now trying to take software to unfocused regions, including Bengal and even to small towns like Mysore and Hubli in Karnataka to take the stress away from cities like Bangalore, said the Union minister for communications and IT, Dayanidhi Maran.

 The ministers statement came after preliminary discussions with an eight-member Swedish delegation led by the countrys communications minister, Ulrica Messing, on the possibilities of joint cooperation in communication and IT.

 Maran said e-governance is one area in which they looked to Sweden for sharing its experience and best practices, adding that the country has an advanced programme in place.

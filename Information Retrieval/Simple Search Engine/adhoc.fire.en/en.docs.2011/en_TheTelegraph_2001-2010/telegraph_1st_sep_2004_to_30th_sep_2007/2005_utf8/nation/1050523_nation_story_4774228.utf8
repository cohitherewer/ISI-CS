 DU faces stick over new course

 New Delhi, May 22 (PTI): Delhi University and an affiliated college have been pulled up by a consumer court for admitting a student to an unrecognised course and putting her future in peril.

 Ordering a refund of Rs 20,460 paid as fee and Rs 5,000 damages for causing her mental agony and harassment, the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (North) found the university and the college guilty of unfair trade practice and deficiency of service.

 Rajul Jain had sought admission for the four-year bachelor in information sciences course for which the university had invited applications. After clearing the entrance tests, she was allotted the College of Applied Science for Women in Vivek Vihar on August 12, 2000.

 Two weeks later, she learnt that the course was recognised neither by the University Grants Commission nor the All India Council for Technical Education.

 Delhi University said it was already offering a three-year course in computer applications and information sciences course was its new four-year version. Admitting that the course did not have approval, the university said it had written to the UGC seeking its recognition.

 Rejecting the contentions, the court said: Since the fact of non-recognition of the four-year course was not mentioned in the prospectus, the complainant and other students were justified in thinking that the university had powers to start the four-year course.

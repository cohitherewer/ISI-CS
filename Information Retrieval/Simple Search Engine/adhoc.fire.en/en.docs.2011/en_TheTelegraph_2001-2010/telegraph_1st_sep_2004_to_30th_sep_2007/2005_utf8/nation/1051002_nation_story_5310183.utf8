The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Hasina eyes Left, heads to Calcutta

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 1: In an attempt to get the Left parties involved in a pro-active Indian policy on Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina is leaving for Calcutta tomorrow to hold talks with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM veteran Jyoti Basu.

 Sections of observers in India and Bangladesh feel that Left leaders, particularly those from Bengal and Tripura ? the two states bordering Bangladesh ? should get involved to breathe life into bilateral initiatives.

 In Calcutta, the Opposition leader and former Prime Minister will also try to meet Mamata Banerjee.

 Hasina arrived in India on September 28 on a pilgrimage-cum-political visit. After praying at the dargah of Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, she met several key figures, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in the Indian government in Delhi. 

 Today, foreign minister Natwar Singh hosted lunch for Hasina. The outburst of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) chief Major-General Jehangir Alam Chowdhury yesterday, in which he held India responsible for the August 17 serial blasts in his country, figured in the discussions between Natwar Singh and Hasina.

 Though taken aback, the Indian leadership reacted with caution to his allegation. India is deeply shocked and dismayed at the remarks, said a statement issued last night by the foreign ministry.

 It dismissed the allegations as baseless and scurrilous and added that the charge was all the more shocking because it has been made against a friendly country.

 Hasina told reporters today that the charge levelled by the BDR chief against India was baseless. It was an attempt by the BNP government to divert the international focus on the country, she added.

 Hasina, perhaps, is trying to suggest to the Indian leadership that her Awami League is Delhis best bet in Bangladesh. Since Bangladesh elections are due in early 2007, the League is keen on Indian support. 

 But the Indian leadership still appears to be hedging its bets on who to back in Bangladesh.

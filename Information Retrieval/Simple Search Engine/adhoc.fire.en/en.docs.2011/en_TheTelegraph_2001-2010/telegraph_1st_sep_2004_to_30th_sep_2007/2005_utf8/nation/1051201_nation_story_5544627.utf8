 Bangla supply to run dry

 Calcutta: Now, a bangla bandh with a difference. 

 The supply of country liquor is set to dry up between December 8 and 10 with the West Bengal Country Spirit Manufacturers and Bottlers Association, which bottles and transports it, calling a strike, says a staff reporter. 

 The strike is the only option, says the association, as the Bengal government is not meeting the mounting cost of transportation, bottling and insurance. There has been no increase in the reimbursement of the cost for the last five to six years, they allege. 

 The government controls the country liquor supply, a major source of revenue.

 All our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. It is becoming increasingly difficult to run the operations at the costs fixed five years ago, said D. Sanyal, the head of the association. We might also go for an indefinite strike, he said. 

 We want the government to fix the purchase price of raw liquor so that we can cover our overhead costs. The bottling charges have not been increased for the last five years though costs have more than doubled. 

 We are also demanding a hike in the local transport and insurance charges. The allowance that the government pays for loss in transit is negligible. We are demanding 1 per cent of the total cost, said Sanyal.

 The strike would create a huge gap between the demand and supply of country liquor, encouraging the spurious liquor trade. The 13 units which are part of the association daily produce 90,000 bottles. It would also result in a huge loss of revenue for the government and labour unrest. 

 Excise officials refused to comment.

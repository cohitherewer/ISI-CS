 Aged couple lives on hope

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Tajpura (Punjab), Dec. 31: It is a tale whose end no one can predict.

 For Saroop Singh, 70, and his wife Surjit, 60, the wait for a telephone call from a brother has added years to their age in less than five days. Their lives have become intertwined with that of those in the Nicobar Islands. Their only source of income came from Campbell Bay ? at least till the tsunamis hit the island.

 Today, Saroop and Surjit are waiting for news of his brother?s family of 15 from whom he has not heard since the waves swamped the island.

 ?My brother Prakash, who was an activist with the Azad Hind Fauj, had shifted to Nicobar Islands nearly four decades ago after the government offered him 18 acres of land for services rendered for the country?s freedom,? Saroop said, as his hands trembled and his voice cracked.

 ?He used to call us regularly. But I have neither heard from him nor his sons since Sunday, when someone told me that water had engulfed all the islands there. I am only waiting for someone to say that they are alive and well,? he said.

 Hard of hearing and with weak eyesight, Saroop can hardly move out of his house. But he has somehow gathered strength to venture out to the nearest phone booth to make calls to his brother that invariably do not get through and continuously asked passers-by of any news regarding Prakash and his family.

 ?With three daughters, who are now married, it was Prakash who has been looking after our needs and provide us with money to survive. He used to visit us every year and leave behind enough for our sustenance,? Surjit said wiping tears.

 ?We only pray that he is safe and his family has survived. We don?t want money, we only want his well-being. He is sure to call some day to say he is okay,? she said.

 No one from the district administration has been of help, but some efforts to trace the family have been made by a local ex-serviceman, Harpal.

 ?It is not easy to lose 15 members of a family in one go. I am doing what I can by trying to get in touch with people in the know of the extent of the disaster through ex-servicemen living in the islands. It is too early to come to any conclusion. Till then both will have to live with hope,? Harpal said.

 The members of Prakash?s family include his three sons, Prabhjot, Harvinder and Mandeep, his three daughters-in-law and their children, one of who got married to a girl from Ropar last year. ?Her family, too, is in the dark,? Saroop said.

 The welfare of families of ex-servicemen and freedom fighters living in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands continues to cause concern in Punjab and Haryana.

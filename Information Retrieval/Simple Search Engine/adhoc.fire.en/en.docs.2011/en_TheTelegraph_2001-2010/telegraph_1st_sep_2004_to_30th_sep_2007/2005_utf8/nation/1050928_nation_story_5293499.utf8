 Iran frowns, but sees a friend

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 27: Iran today said it was greatly surprised by Indias Vienna vote but added that it would not take any hasty action against Delhi.

 India had voted with the US in Vienna to pass an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolution requiring that Iran be reported at an unspecified date to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions.

 Indias vote came as a great surprise to us, foreign ministry spokesperson Hamid Reza Asefi said in Tehran after he threatened to use trade ties to punish countries that voted against Iran.

 But Irans chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani said the country was willing to continue its friendly relationship with India. We should not lose a friend because of one incident, Larijani said. We will have talks with India over Irans nuclear ambitions in the future.

 India, which had defended the vote by saying it helped delay immediate reference to the UN council, stepped up its damage-control bid today by briefing Iran.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran told Iranian ambassador S.Z. Yaghoubi in Delhi the vote was aimed at averting a confrontation between Tehran and the international community. 

 The Iranian envoy expressed disappointment over the resolution, saying it was not logical. 

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said the vote would not affect a proposed gas pipeline project. 

 No, I do not believe the current development would in any way adversely affect the progress made on the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline or the import of liquefied natural gas, Aiyar said in Delhi.

 In June, before the current government led by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power in Iran, India had signed a pact with Tehran to import 5 million tonnes of gas a year from 2009-10 but the agreement is yet to be ratified by the board of National Iranian Oil Co.

 But Aiyar said he anticipated no problems.

 India appears to be banking on the fact that Iran also needs a market for its abundant gas supplies. Having been isolated by the West, Iran will find it difficult to ignore the Indian market.

 PM to meet Left

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has invited Left leaders to breakfast tomorrow in a bid to clear the air on the Iran vote. The Left parties are upset with the Centre for voting with the US and have threatened a nationwide agitation.

 Stung MPs scream fraud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Lok Sabha committee probing the cash-for-questions scandal will on Saturday question Cobrapost.com, the portal that did the sting operation, amid allegations of tape-doctoring and trickery.

 For instance, suspended Rajya Sabha member Chhattrapal Singh Lodha has alleged that the money he was filmed pocketing was not a bribe but ? as he was given to understand by the decoy ? membership fees for the NGO he runs.

 Lodha is not being investigated by the Lok Sabha panel, which is concerned with the other 10 tainted MPs, all lower House members.

 The inquiry committee has asked for the unedited tapes after suspicions were voiced that they might have been doctored.

 A member said it was rather curious that the girl used as decoy, who assumed the name Namita Gokhale, made the same gesture against the same background in every shot that shows a member accepting money. She counted the notes in the same way. It was impossible to shoot every such scene from the same angle and against the same backdrop.

 BJP sources said Lodha had indicated to the party that he was trapped by the girl.

 Sources said the decoy first rang up Lodha shortly before Diwali and said she would like to meet him and offer him her greetings. When he said he was not in Delhi but at his home in Bulandshahr, she said she would visit him there. She arrived with a box of sweets and an envelope containing Rs 1,100.

 On another occasion, she reportedly asked Lodha what the Dr before his name signified, a BJP source said. The MP told her he was an ayurvedic doctor and had his own NGO that treated patients from villages.

 She allegedly said she wanted to join the NGO and handed him a membership fee of Rs 5,000. Lodha claims that this is now being passed off as a bribe.

 The five Pandavas (of the House probe committee) will decide the fate of Duryodhan (the sting operations code-name), a parliamentarian said, adding that formal suspension of the accused MPs may be difficult since they have pleaded not guilty.

 Among the punishments being considered are arrest, dismissal from the party, a CBI probe, expulsion from Parliament, suspension, reprimand and censure.

 Open book

 The ethics committee of the Rajya Sabha ? which had recommended Lodhas suspension from the House ? has come up with a plan to allow people access to a register of members interest. The register lists the MPs financial assets and liabilities, professional engagements and salaries.

 Such information can be accessed with the permission of the chairman of the committee, Karan Singh. The seeker must declare his occupation and some other personal details.

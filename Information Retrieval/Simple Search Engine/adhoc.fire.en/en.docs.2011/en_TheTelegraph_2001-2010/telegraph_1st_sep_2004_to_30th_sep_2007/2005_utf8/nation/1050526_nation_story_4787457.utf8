 Kovalam estate to change hands

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 25: The controversial hotel property on the Kovalam beach in Kerala is changing hands, with Hotel Leela Ventures negotiating its purchase from the M Far group, a subsidiary of the Galfar Group, headed by NRI businessman Mohammed Ali.

 According to reports, the initial deal has been fixed around Rs 100 crore for the 64.5-acre property. But this excludes the Halcyon Castle, now mired in litigation. 

 The Marxist-led Opposition has been campaigning against a private individual appropriating the disputed heritage property.

 The Galfar Group had purchased the former ITDC property in July 2002 for Rs 42 crore and renamed it Kovalam Hotels Pvt. Ltd. Hotel Leela Ventures chief Captain Krishna Nair, who is from Kannur district, told a local television channel that he had apprised Bombay Stock Exchange of the move to buy the hotel and is awaiting the nod from the Securities and Exchange Board of India as Leela Ventures is a public limited company.

 However, Nair added a rider. 

 We are happy to come to Kerala but only if the political leaders and the people are happy. Our group has successful ventures in the tourism sector in Mumbai, Goa and Bangalore. Ive been often asked why we have no investments in Kerala. This I reckon is an opportunity, he said.

 On the other side, M.M. Abdul Basher, the representative of the M Far group, said: We are leaving with a heavy heart. Politicians had kicked up an unnecessary controversy, especially because some of them have been intolerant towards the NRI investment. A non-resident Keralite, who had shown the will to invest in Kerala, has been given the boot.

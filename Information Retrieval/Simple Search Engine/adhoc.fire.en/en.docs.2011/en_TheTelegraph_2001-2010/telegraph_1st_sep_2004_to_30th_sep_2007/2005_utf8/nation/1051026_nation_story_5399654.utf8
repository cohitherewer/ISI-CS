 Cong asks Sonia to bell the cat in J amp;K

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: The onus of announcing the likely extension of Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds tenure as Jammu and Kashmir chief minister may fall on Sonia Gandhi, with senior Congress leaders shying away from conveying the unpleasant news to workers. 

 Mufti, of the Peoples Democratic Party, became chief minister in October 2002 after a pact with ally Congress that the job would go to the party after three years. 

 The Congress leadership today said its final decision on whether to allow Mufti to continue for the remaining three years of the six-year term would be made known soon. Whatever decision the party takes on the issue, (that) would be announced shortly, senior leader and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said. 

 The announcement could come as early as Thursday or when Sonia goes on her proposed Kashmir trip later this week, some party functionaries suggested. 

 On Sunday, Sonia had asked Mukherjee to speak to Mufti and his daughter Mehbooba, the PDP president, and ascertain the views of state Congress leaders. 

 Most of Sonias colleagues are said to have suggested that the decision in favour of Muftis continuation be announced by her. 

 That alone can assure its acceptance by the state party unit, which has been pushing for a Congress leader at the helm. 

 The central leadership is also said to be working on a proposal with Mufti on redistribution of some key portfolios, to appease the rank and file. The Congress is looking to get, among others, the finance portfolio now held by the PDPs Muzaffer Beg. 

 Most of the Congresss 20 legislators are camping here to press their demand for taking over the leadership from Mufti. Some, including Assembly Speaker Tara Chand, met Sonia today. 

 However, the MLAs who also met Ambika Soni, the AICC general secretary in charge of Kashmir, assured her that they would abide by whatever decision Sonia took.

 Soni and senior Congress leaders from Kashmir, like Ghulam Nabi Azad, Saifuddin Soz, Karan Singh and M.L. Fotedar, feel the Congress should take up the responsibility of leading the ministry. 

 But at a meeting yesterday with Sonia, this opinion was apparently not shared by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Mukherjee, Arjun Singh and A.K. Antony.

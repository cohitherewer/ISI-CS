 US hikes visa quota with degree rider

 Washington, May 5 (PTI): The US has announced an additional 20,000 visas to foreign workers in the H1-B category, mainly availed by Indian IT professionals, thus fulfilling a long-standing demand by American firms and academic groups. 

 US companies can submit applications for the additional H1-B visas from May 12, the department of home securitys immigration agency said. 

 The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said the visas would be granted only to foreign workers with at least a Masters-level degree from a US institution. 

 Last month, the immigration services had said the additional visas would be available to all qualified applicants ? not just those holding an advanced degree from US universities.

 The Congress had approved the additional 20,000 visas last year after academic groups and US technology firms complained that the reduced 65,000-worker cap was too low to meet demand. 

 Some groups argue that the influx of skilled foreign workers is costing US citizens and permanent residents their jobs.

 The 65,000 H1-B visas approved by the Congress for the fiscal year that began on October 1 were taken in a day. The largest number of such foreign workers was Indian.

 Status online 

 Students and exchange visitors 

 seeking to study in the US will be able to monitor online 

 the status of their student and exchange visitor information 

 system (Sevis) fee payments.

 A newly upgraded website, www.fmjfee.com, 

 allows students and exchange visitors to verify online if 

 the US immigration and customs enforcement has received 

 their Sevis I-901 fee payment and when the official receipt 

 for the payment was issued.

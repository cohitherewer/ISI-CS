 Fresh UP violence claims six

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 5: Six lives were lost as communal violence broke out in Barabanki and Chandauli districts of Uttar Pradesh today just when Mau, where riots had killed 10 people last month, was limping back to normality.

 A rumour that minority farmers were slaughtering cows sparked a frenzy in Barabanki, where at least 40 homes were torched. The district administration refused to confirm reports of three deaths but admitted that at least 20 people were injured.

 In the Chakia area of Chandauli, near Varanasi, three villagers were killed this morning as a battle over land took on a communal hue.

 A piece of land seized from a wealthy Hindu under land ceiling laws had been given to Muslim farmers. A court recently restored the land to the earlier owner but as he tried to take control of it, he ran into a public protest, said Chandauli senior superintendent of police R.K. Chaturvedi. Soon it degenerated into riots.

 In Barabanki, according to superintendent of police S.B. Shirodkar, the trouble began in the early hours in a cluster of villages in the Mohammadpur area. Following a rumour of massive cow slaughter, some people attacked the farmers and set fire to their homes.

 The police were slow to act ? a lapse that has led to an inspectors suspension. The situation has been brought under control by sending reinforcements. After clamping prohibitory orders, we have deployed the Provincial Armed Constabulatory, district magistrate S.P. Singh said. Some 45 people have been arrested.

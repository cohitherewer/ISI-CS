 Sena upset in civic elections

 Mumbai: The Shiv Sena on Monday suffered its first electoral jolt after the expulsion of Narayan Rane in June, reports our special correspondent. The party lost control over the municipal corporation in the satellite suburbs of Kalyan and Dombivli on the outskirts of Mumbai.

 The Sena emerged on top with 29 seats, but the results have thrown up a hung House.

 In the 107-seat corporation, Sena ally BJP slumped to 16. The Congress gained marginally to bag 21 and the Independents won 18 seats .

 The surprise gainer was Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party that improved its tally from 10 in the last elections to 23 this time.

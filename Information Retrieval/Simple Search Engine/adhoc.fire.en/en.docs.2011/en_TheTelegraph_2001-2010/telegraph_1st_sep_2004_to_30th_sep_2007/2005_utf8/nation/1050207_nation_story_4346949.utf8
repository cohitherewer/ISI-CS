 Cricket blow to ?safe? sell

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 6: The Pakistan Cricket Board?s decision not to play a Test match at Motera stadium here has dealt a blow to the Narendra Modi government?s effort to sell ?Safe Gujarat?.

 Pakistan?s reservations about playing in Ahmedabad became public yesterday when Gujarat home minister was holding forth on ?How safe is Gujarat? at an IPS officers? conference in the state capital.

 Minister Amit Shah said the PCB should have cited its reasons. ?I?m sure security is not the reason. It is political, nothing else,? he said.

 PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan indicated as much today when he said ?our reservations are based on political reasons?.

 Narhari Amin, the Gujarat Cricket Association president, was upset with the PCB?s decision but said he was yet to receive an official intimation. 

 ?After the communal riots in 2002, two cricket matches have been played at Motera and there has been absolutely no problem,? Amin said.

 Senior Congress leader Hasmukh Patel said the PCB should have trusted the Indian people, if not Gujarat?s BJP government.

 Danseuse Mallika Sarabhai did not outright disapprove of the PCB decision.

 ?The fact remains that not a single person accused of killing and rape in 2002 is behind bars. I know some people who do not want to move to Ahmedabad; they are not only Muslims but Hindus as well. If our people are still apprehensive, I can understand their (PCB) apprehension,?? she said.

 Delhi mulls leash on private colleges

 Arjun Singh: In a bind

New Delhi, Jan. 15: The Centre is determined to bring a legislation to regulate private colleges, primarily because of mounting pressure from the southern states. 

 But there are several complex issues blurring the outlines of the bill. The human resource development ministry is not clear how the Centre can lay down a uniform regulatory policy with regard to fees and admission for all states. ?We can just issue a set of guidelines and the states can have their own acts based on these guidelines,? said a ministry official. 

 There are different kinds of private institutions ? private aided institutions, private unaided institutions ? and the Centre believes it will be difficult to have a uniform policy for all. ?We could even have a body like the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,? said the official. 

 Human resource development minister Arjun Singh held a brainstorming session with education ministers in Bangalore this week. 

 What emerged from the two-day discussions was the need for a central legislation, but the modalities are unclear. Some ministry officials would not mind passing the buck to the states because the job of streamlining private institutions seems complicated. 

 ?This could even mean going back to the earlier licence raj where governments imposed a set of rules,? said another official. But this seems to be a minority view. The HRD ministry believes the southern states are faced with a problem, with private institutions charging enormous fees and taking advantage of the quota system. 

 At present, there are two quotas ? the management quota and the merit quota. Some students who do not pass the merit test are admitted under the management quota. The proposed legislation will do away with this concession. ?Management quota students will also have to pass a merit test,? said the official. 

 The Union ministry also pointed out that states have passed their own laws to regulate private universities. ?But these have not been successful,? the official said. For instance, a relatively new state like Chhattisgarh till recently had 103 private universities. In less than two days, a dozen institutions cropped up. ?Many have been shut down. At present, there are some 36-odd universities,? said an official. 

 Linked to the proposed legislation is the entry of foreign universities. ?We also have to keep in mind the General Agreement of Trade in Services,? said the official. The ministry has said the legislation will not deal with foreign varsities. But the laws of the land will apply to them, he pointed out.

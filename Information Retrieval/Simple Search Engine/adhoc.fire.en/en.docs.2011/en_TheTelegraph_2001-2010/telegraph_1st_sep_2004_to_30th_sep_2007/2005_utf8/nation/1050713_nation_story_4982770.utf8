 Song to check kala-azar spread

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, July 12: In the faint light of wicker lamps on a sultry night in the mosquito- and sandfly-infested tracts of eastern India, medics Vijila Isac and Isac David join members of one of Indias most primitive tribes in a song.

 Adaku motto thanu, kala-azaree menothi pariyee, they sing, a line that says a swollen spleen may be a sign of kala-azar, a potentially lethal parasite infection ? spread by the bites of sandflies ? that has seen a resurgence in Bihar, Jharkhand and Bengal in recent years.

 Its a song Vijila and David, a husband-wife team, composed to deliver health messages in the traditional language and tunes of the Malto, a tribe living on the hill and forest tracts of Sahibganj district in Jharkhand. Over the past eight years, since they moved to Sahibganj to manage a community hospital there, the Isacs have sometimes had to make do with songs alone, in the absence of diagnostic tests or drugs to treat kala-azar.

 Its frustrating. The diagnostic tests are not reliable and we dont get drugs, Vijila said today at a special review meeting of the kala-azar control programme called by the health ministry. The plight of the Isacs and the Malto, public health officials said, illustrates operational inefficiencies that have dogged the programme aimed at eliminating the infection from India by 2010.

 Government officials said its not lack of funds but poor management of the programme at the district level that is posing obstacles. The Rs 40-crore budget for kala-azar provides cash, drugs and insecticides to the states.

 The Centre has provided drugs under action plans drawn up by states. But, except in Bengal, some of the aid remains unutilised, a health ministry official said.

 David, the director of Prem Jyoti Community Hospital in Baramsia in Sahibganj district, said free drugs for treatment have been available for the Malto only over the past year.

 Treatment for a single patient costs about Rs 1,200 and the tribals cannot afford it, said David, who estimates that about 3,000 people among the Malto are struck by kala-azar every year.

 The Malto eke out a living cultivating maize, mustard and tamarind. Their number has dwindled from about a million a century ago to 85,000 now and, David said, malaria and kala-azar are major infections they suffer from.

 Health officials said some districts were not using insecticides against the sandfly in the right manner.

 Pumps are not repaired for years, spraying personnel have not been trained, and spraying is done in a half-hearted fashion, said Rita Teotia, a joint secretary in the health ministry. The way its being done, it may do more harm than good.

 A steady resurgence of kala-azar over the past three decades has helped the parasite establish itself in 31 districts in Bihar, 11 in Bengal, four in Jharkhand and two in eastern Uttar Pradesh. The number of kala-azar cases in India increased from 12,000 in 2002 to 22,000 in 2004. The annual number of deaths over the past four years has ranged between 150 and 200.

 The states have now been asked to pencil micro-plans for local control efforts by the end of this month and prepare for special surveillance programmes to be conducted in October. Were hoping things will improve, said David.

 Problems in the diagnosis of kala-azar are also being addressed. An infectious disease specialist at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi said the diagnostic test for kala-azar commonly used in India is based on the parasite that is found in South America.

 A new test based on the local parasite, and thus promising more reliable diagnosis, is likely to be in the market soon, Dr Sarman Singh said.

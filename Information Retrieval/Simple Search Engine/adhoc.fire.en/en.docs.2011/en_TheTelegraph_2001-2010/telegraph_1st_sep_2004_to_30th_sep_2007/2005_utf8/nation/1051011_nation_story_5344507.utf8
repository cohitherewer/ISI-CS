 Jammu, Oct. 10: The earthquake that has tied the two Kashmirs together in grief and struggle has failed to bring even a short respite from militant violence. Armed bands slaughtered 11 people, including two children, in a remote and mountainous area of Rajouri district on Sunday night, the day after the devastation.

 Around midnight, gunmen entered the home of Kartar Chand in Gabbar village and killed five members of his family, including Kashmir Singh and Panjab Singh, aged eight and 10. They ? or another group ? then struck at Rajbagar village, killing five members of Munshi Rams family by slitting their throats.

 Nazir Mohammad of Kulhar village was the other person killed. All these mountain villages are in the Budhal area, where more than 100 timber and mud houses collapsed on Saturday morning.

 This poverty-stricken area has been bearing the brunt of militant attacks over the past few months. It was the 14th such incident in the past two months, the senior superintendent of police, J.P. Singh, told reporters.

 The United Jehad Council ? an umbrella group of several Pakistan-based militant outfits ? had declared that keeping in mind the sufferings wrought by the earthquake, it would temporarily halt its operations.

 The police suspect the hand of the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen Pir Panjal Range in the killings. Also under suspicion are two former police officers who had deserted the force to join the militants in Rajouri.

 Militants also killed two persons in Anantnag on Sunday night. Gunmen barged into Rashid Rathers home at Panzat village and shot his 19-year-old daughter Jasi Jan dead. Another group sprayed bullets inside Ghulam Rasool Bhats home in Aroo-Mohanpora, killing his son Nissar Ahmad and critically injuring Bhat and daughter Rohi Jan.

 Mumbai, Dec. 11: Lakme India Fashion Week is history. How does Sahara India Fashion Week sound?

 Its been over a week since Lakme and IMG snapped ties with the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI). So it is curtains for the high-profile fashion extravaganza, Lakme India Fashion Week. The FDCI will, however, go ahead with the event as planned, but call it the India Fashion Week and will hold it in New Delhi from April 5 to 9 next year.

 By all available reports, Sahara is the frontrunner in the race among corporates to claim Lakmes space. IMG, of course, had to bow out to Percept way back in September. Insiders say this may have been the catalyst in the FDCI-Lakme divorce.

 Lakme says it opted out of the FDCI-sponsored event for commercial reasons. 

 The FDCI asked for three times the amount we have paid for the last three years to renew our contract, said Lakme vice-president Anil Chopra.

 They argue its because the event is going to be held twice a year. They forget that instead of seven days, its now going to be only five days, twice a year. The extra money wasnt worth it for just three extra days.

 Lakme and IMG will now organise a near-simultaneous fashion week, called the Lakme Fashion Week, in Mumbai from March 28 next year.

 Although there is more to the split than the growing Mumbai-Delhi divide on all fronts, fashion designers, at least in Mumbai, are unofficially quite happy about the FDCI vs Lakme-IMG battle.

 It opens up more opportunities for us. The list of buyers will grow because each organiser will try to outdo the other. And that certainly means more business for us, said a Mumbai designer.

 IMG has already announced that it will ensure participation of international buyers and organise coverage in the international media.

 Although Calcutta and Bangalore designers have sided with the FDCI, Mumbai designers are fighting shy of indicating their loyalties. 

 This is primarily because the FDCI has banned designers from participating in both the events, though Lakme and IMG have been categorical that they have no problems with dual participation.

 In a sarcastic open letter to the fashion fraternity and the media, Lakme and IMG said the restriction on designers was illegal, though neither confirmed whether it was mulling legal action against the FDCI.

 The fashion industry is also planning moves to circumvent the FDCI ban on dual participation. Many are planning proxy entry into the events through ghost designers.

 There is always a way to beat any draconian rule. We will devise a method, said a Mumbai designer.

 While designers are planning moves to subvert the ban, the models are hoping to rake in the moolah.

 Top models are negotiating hard. And why not? No restriction has been imposed on the model community. Twin events mean more work for us. Besides, the short supply of good ramp models gives us the opportunity to bargain hard, said model Carol Gracias.

 Despite the gung-ho attitude, it may be a little unrealistic to hike charges at this stage. Especially since IMG-managed supermodels like Giselle Bundchen are expected to walk the ramp in Mumbai.

 Lakme and IMG are leaving nothing to chance in their attempt to attract participants. They have announced that participation in the Lakme Fashion Week will qualify up to three designers for possible inclusion in global fashion events, including the Olympus Fashion Week in New York, Mercedes-Benz Australian Fashion Week and the Singapore Fashion Festival.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 En route to bridge, caravan leaks

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, April 7: Pakistan 30, India 29.

 These many names were supposed to be on the passenger manifest as the buses rolled up to the peace bridge today.

 The number stayed put at 30 for Pakistan, but slipped to 19 for India no sooner than the bus from Srinagar clocked 4 km.

 A couple, Bashir Ahmad and Zebu Nissa of Surankote in Poonch, disembarked barely 4 km away at a curve near Pandrethen on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road.

 Officials cited ?ill health? as the reason for the abrupt end to the journey. Sources said the couple had earlier requested senior police officers to be allowed to return home, but had been persuaded to board the bus.

 A senior police officer said 21 passengers were on board when the bus was flagged off at Srinagar by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi.

 Initially, 29 people had been cleared for the journey. Five had pulled out because of what officials termed ?technical reasons? in the wake of persistent militant threats.

 Two women, Muneera Bibi and Ghulam Fatima, who also belong to Surankote, were allowed to return to their homes in the Jammu region yesterday after they pleaded with the authorities. Eleven of the passengers hail from the border towns of Poonch and Rajouri while the rest were from the Valley. One passenger who was taken ill was also permitted to return to his home in Srinagar this morning.

 The complex where the passengers were being sheltered was attacked yesterday by a suicide squad. 

 The militant groups that carried out the attack said today there would be more such strikes on the bus service. ?Our attacks have not ended and we vow to turn the bus? into a coffin,? a spokesperson for the four outfits said.

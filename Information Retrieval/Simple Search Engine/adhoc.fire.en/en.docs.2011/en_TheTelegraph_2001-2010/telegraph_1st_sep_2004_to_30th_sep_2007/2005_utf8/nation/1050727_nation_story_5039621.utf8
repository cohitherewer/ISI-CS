The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Chargesheet filed against Telgi amp; 65

 Pune, July 26 (PTI): More than a year after taking over the probe into the multi-crore stamp paper scam, the CBI today filed chargesheets against prime accused Abdul Karim Telgi and 65 others.

 Telgis wife Shahida, former Mumbai police commissioner R.S. Sharma and two politicians are among the accused against whom chargesheets have been filed in the Bund Garden case that led to detection of the racket.

 The chargesheet in what the bureau has described as the mother of all fake stamp paper cases was filed in the Mcoca court of judge B.N. Deshpande.

 As expected, several police officers were named ? former inspector-general Shridhar Wagal, deputy commissioner Pradeep Sawant, assistant commissioners M. Mulani and Gokul Patil, inspectors Dattatreya Dhal and Vashist Andale, and assistant inspector Dilip Kamat. So were Samajwadi Janata Party MLA from Dhule Anil Gote and former Andhra Pradesh minister and Desam MLA C. Krishna Yadav. 

 However, former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal was spared.

 The chargesheet details the modus operandi of Telgis dealings in fake stamp papers and traces his rise as well as the impact of the scam.

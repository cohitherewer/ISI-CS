 Cracks in Speaker boycott

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 19: The BJP?s plan to isolate Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee seems to have backfired. 

 The party had opposed his move to convene a meeting of presiding officers tomorrow to debate on the demarcation of judicial and legislative powers to minimise encroachment into each other?s domain.

 BJP leaders had also walked out of an all-party meeting convened by Chatterjee to discuss the judicial interference in the wake of the Supreme Court order on the Jharkhand floor test. 

 The party had hinted that presiding officers belonging to NDA-ruled states would not attend the meet. 

 But now, the Speaker of the Biju Janata Dal-ruled Orissa Assembly has decided to attend the meet while senior Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav has also come out in Chatterjee?s support. The BJD is an NDA partner.

 The Tamil Nadu Speaker, who belongs neither to the UPA nor the NDA, however, has said he would not attend the meeting. 

 In Ranchi, Jharkhand Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari said he would stay away from the conference on the advice of NDA convener George Fernandes. 

 ?No, I am not attending the conference,? he told reporters, adding that ?on Thursday, I spoke to George Fernandes. He told me it had been decided that none of the presiding officers from the NDA-ruled states would attend?. 

 Namdhari said he was contacted by the Madhya Pradesh Speaker who wanted to know whether he should attend. ?I told him about my conversation with Fernandes and he has also cancelled his visit.?

 Almost all Speakers and their deputies, barring those from the four BJP-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, will attend the conference.

 The Chhattisgarh and Gujarat presiding officers have sent their regret letters to the Speaker?s office citing ongoing Assembly sessions. The Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh Speakers have sent no such communication.

 PM happy but cautious on Pak

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, April 20: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said ?serious and sustained? dialogue between India and Pakistan could proceed only in an atmosphere free from violence, sounding the first note of caution since his talks with Pervez Musharraf earlier this week.

 Singh, who made a statement in Parliament on Musharraf?s visit, expressed satisfaction over the way his talks with the Pakistan President went. But it did not stop him from making clear that no overnight solution on Kashmir should be expected.

 ?While I am satisfied with the progress achieved in our talks during the visit, we should remain conscious of the difficulties ahead,? he said. 

 ?The difficult issues that divide us have bedevilled relations between India and Pakistan for far too long to hope for an immediate resolution. The threat to the peace process from extremist forces and terrorist organisations has not been eliminated,? he added.

 Singh also made it clear that the seriousness with which Pakistan implements the agreed confidence-building measures and takes steps against terrorist organisations in the coming months would be crucial to the peace process. ?We look forward to Pakistan implementing their assurances in letter and spirit.?

 Singh pointed out that the reference to the January 6 joint statement in the document he issued with Musharraf on Monday was in effect a reaffirmation of Islamabad?s commitment to not allow Pakistani territory to be used for militant activities against India. 

 The clarification was in response to questions from some sections on whether the Centre had toned down its stand on cross-border terrorism to make sure it had a joint statement with Musharraf at the end of the visit.

 The January 6 statement that Musharraf issued in Islamabad last year with then Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee is significant because it is the first written document in which Pakistan has pledged not to allow its soil to be used for anti-India activities. 

 The statement that Singh and Musharraf issued only referred to the Islamabad statement and did not re-affirm the paragraph on Pakistan?s commitment to stop cross-border terrorism.

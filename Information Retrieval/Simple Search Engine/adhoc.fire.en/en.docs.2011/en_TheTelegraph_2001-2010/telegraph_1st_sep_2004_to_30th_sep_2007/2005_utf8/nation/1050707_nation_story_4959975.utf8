 Bill to close kitchen-OTs

 G.S. MUDUR

 up to the mark?

 New Delhi. July 6: Kitchens turned into operation theatres and poorly-trained pathology technicians struggling to draw blood ? some features of Indias largely unregulated health care sector ? may soon become history.

 The health ministry is now preparing a Clinical Establishment Bill designed to ensure minimum standards of infrastructure and levels of quality in hospitals and other health care centres, senior officials said today.

 We hope to introduce the bill in Parliament by the end of this year, Prasanna Hota, health secretary, said at a meeting hosted by the health ministry for representatives of professional medical societies and doctors.

 The meeting focused on some contentious issues in the countrys health care system ? the need for minimum standards in clinical establishments, continuing medical education for doctors long after they have earned their degrees, and rural service for doctors.

 The bill, applicable to both private and government establishments, will pave the way for a national council of clinical establishments, a body of professionals that will define the minimum standards of infrastructure and quality in all clinical establishments.

 The standards, covering physical infrastructure, equipment, and staff strength and qualifications, will vary according to the size and type of clinical establishments, their location, and the services that they will provide.

 Public health experts have long expressed concern at the absence of regulation or standards in Indias health care system. 

 A survey conducted several years ago by the non-government Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes had detected residential premises converted into nursing homes with a kitchen as an operation theatre. In the absence of regulation, experts say, establishments can operate without adequately trained staff and without appropriate equipment.

 The standards to be defined through the Clinical Establishment Bill may differ between rural and urban areas. Well need to take into account the ground reality, but without compromising on minimum standards, a senior health officer said.

 The government also announced a task force to seek effective strategies for continuing medical education for doctors. The issues before it are who will implement continuing medical education and how it will be done, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said.

 The task force will examine a proposal for re-registration of doctors who have undergone at least 30 hours of continuing medical education over a five-year period. The Delhi Medical Council is the only body so far that has made re-registration mandatory for its members.

 But doctors say the course content is sometimes dictated by drug companies. The content of the continuing medical education programmes and even the doctors wholl deliver the lectures are picked in consultation with pharmaceutical companies, a delegate at the meeting said.

 And rational use of drugs is not usually part of continuing medical education at all, said Dr Mira Shiva, a senior public health specialist with the Voluntary Health Association of India in New Delhi.

 Several medical societies, such as the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, the Association of Surgeons of India, and the Association of Physicians of India, favour compulsory continuing medical education and organise courses for their members.

 The government is also examining proposals to make a short period of rural service mandatory before a medical student can apply for a postgraduate programme, Ramadoss said. 

 Health experts have cautioned that the national rural health mission launched earlier this year is unlikely to work unless the government finds ways to get anaesthetists, gynaecologists, and paediatricians to work in rural health centres.

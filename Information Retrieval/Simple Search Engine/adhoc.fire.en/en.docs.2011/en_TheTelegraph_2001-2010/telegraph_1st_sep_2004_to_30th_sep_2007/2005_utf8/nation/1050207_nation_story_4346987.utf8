 Coup closes in on Nepal scribes

 Kathmandu, Feb. 6: The army officers who vetted the pages of Nepal?s leading newspapers ? Kantipur in Nepali and Kathmandu Post in English ? may have left the premises of the newspapers? offices at Baneswar, but that has brought no freedom from fear for the country?s beleaguered journalists. 

 In fact, the army?s message to the media has come on a harsher note over the past two days. The president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ), Tara Nath Dahal, was arrested yesterday and the organisations general secretary, Bishnu Nisthuri, picked up from his home the previous night. 

 All that the FNJ could do was to issue an appeal to the civil society at home and the international community to put pressure on the government to release the journalists. 

 But given the censorship of the media, there seems little need for the army to arrest journalists. All that the newspapers and the state-run television channel are offering is the government propaganda. News reports and opinion pieces are all about how King Gyanendras coup was a welcome move to save the country from the Maoists and ?corrupt? politicians. 

 One weekly, Saptahik Bimarsh, that sang a different tune by blacking out its entire editorial page was promptly told to stop publication. The owners of another weekly, Samay, edited by one of the country?s well-known journalists, Yubaraj Ghimire, shut down this week?s edition. 

 ?But it?s not 1960 any more,? said one prominent journalist, referring to the first royal coup by King Mahendra, father of the present ruler, against the government of B.P. Koirala in December of that year. That time, too, Koirala, members of his cabinet and all other members of Parliament were detained for months. 

 He complained that their colleagues in the districts were being threatened with death if they tried to defy the press censorship.

 There are signs, though, that a section of the press here is planning to brave the repression and organise some sort of protest. ?Having tasted freedom of speech, the society cannot accept the old, feudal ways,? another scribe said. 

 The journalists are not, however, alone in facing the army?s wrath. Several leading lawyers and leaders of the human rights movement have either been arrested or forced to flee their homes. 

 With the local telephone lines restored for an hour so in the mornings also in the past two days, the Nepal Bar Association has started collecting reports of the army?s repression from the districts. The first such report, compiled yesterday, listed such acts by the army and the police at Pokhara, Nepalganj, Birganj and Biratnagar. 

 The association?s president, Sambhu Thapa, who has initiated the move to collect the reports, is said to have expressed fears that the government was planning to reduce the number of appellate courts from 16 to five so that victims of the government?s repression could not file habeas corpus cases in these courts. 

 Appellate courts in Nepal function as intermediaries between the district courts and the supreme courts and are the mainstay for the people seeking justice. 

 The attack on lawyers too has begun with the raid on the house of Yogendra Adhikari, president of the Kathmandu district court bar association. He is said to have gone underground to evade the arrest.

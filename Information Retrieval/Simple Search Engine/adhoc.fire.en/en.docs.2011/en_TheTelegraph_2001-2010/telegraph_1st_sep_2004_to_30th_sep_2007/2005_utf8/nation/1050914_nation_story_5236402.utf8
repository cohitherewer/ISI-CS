The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Child for sale at bus stand, price Rs 1500

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Sept. 13: With faltering steps, the seller was moving from one prospective buyer to another. Its a bargain, he was saying ? even cattle costs three to four times more.

 Just hand me Rs 1,500 and its yours.

 It wasnt just the slurred speech ? the hawker was obviously drunk ? that explained the look of incomprehension on the faces around him. It was the ware.

 In bright daylight, before hundreds of pairs of eyes at the Guduvancheri bus stand, where you caught the bus to the temple town of Kancheepuram, a man was offering to sell an infant.

 It stirred from time to time in the mans arms, uttering a soft cry or two. Most onlookers just froze in horror ? till one of them had the presence of mind to call the police.

 Selling babies in the open is a new thing, a senior police officer in Kancheepuram said over the phone.

 The police believe that Ramachandran, 55, stole the one-and-a-half-year-old boy from his parents. But the man is totally drunk and the police have learnt nothing from him so far.

 He is not co-operating with us in the interrogation, the officer said, adding that Ramachandran has been remanded in custody. We still havent a clue where the baby came from.

 The boy has managed to mumble a few Hindi words, suggesting its the son of a north Indian couple. He has been sent to a childcare home in Chennai.

 Yesterdays incident has raised fresh concerns about children being sold or abandoned in the state.

 A study by the Tamil Nadu unit of the New Delhi-based Campaign Against Child Trafficking recently found that babies stolen from paediatric wards of government hospitals ? as well as those kidnapped from slums ? are sold to child adoption centres.

 The centres put these babies up for adoption outside the country and charge a hefty fee ranging from $3,000 to $5,000.

 Apart from that, instances of infants being abandoned have risen in the state in recent months. The police suspect that most of them are babies of unwed mothers or HIV-infected parents.

 Last month, the police found an infant left in a trash can near the suburban Tambaram railway station. Its cries had attracted the notice of early morning commuters.

 A booming organ racket also thrived in the state till recently. 

 Several years ago, powerloom weavers families in Komarapalayam, near Erode, were routinely selling their kidneys for Rs 1.5-2 lakh to hospitals in places as far away as Bangalore. 

 The motive ranged from paying off debts to marrying off daughters.

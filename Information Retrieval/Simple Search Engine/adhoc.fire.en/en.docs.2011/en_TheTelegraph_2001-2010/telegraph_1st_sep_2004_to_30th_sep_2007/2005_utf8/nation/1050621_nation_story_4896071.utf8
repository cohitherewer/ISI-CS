 Gautam notice on Patna walls

 K.C. PHILIP 

 Patna, June 20: The rumour 

 was everywhere: Gautam Goswamis poster has been stuck 

 in public places. But what the curious public saw was just 

 a court notice asking Goswami to appear in a court. 

 The absence of the photograph of one of the most wanted men in Bihar today might have disappointed quite a few, if the casual remarks of some members of the public are any indicator. 

 Goswami, former Patna district magistrate and prime accused in the flood relief scam, has been evading arrest ever since the special vigilance court here issued the warrant on May 28. His anticipatory bail petition has been rejected by the special court, following which he has filed a new petition in the high court. 

 The state capital is still uncertain on the status of Goswami. He has not yet been suspended and hence is still in service. He had earlier submitted his resignation from the IAS, which he has taken back. For the time being at least, one thing is clear ? the resignation drama is over, chief secretary G.S. Kang said. 

 Director-general of police Ashish Ranjan Sinha said Goswami would be arrested any time if he failed to surrender. He is still a government servant and I am sure he will surrender, Sinha said when a reporter asked if the police were making arrangements for his surrender. 

 The law will take its own course ? warrant, property attachment and so on. The court notice of today could be a process towards issuing the attachment, Sinha added. 

 Governor Buta Singh, however, had only one answer: All legal procedures will be followed in this matter as well. 

 Vigilance special magistrate Jeetendra Mohan Sharma issued the order today for Goswami and two other accused, Amitabh Arun and Devendra Kumar, to appear in court. The copies of the order were posted at many places in Patna today, including the busy Dak Bungalow square on Frazer Road. 

 The other prime accused, Santosh Jha, under judicial custody in Beur central jail, too, has hogged the limelight with his alleged mobile phone threat call from the jail. 

 Jhas estranged wife Rachna and her brother have allegedly accused him of threatening to finish them off if they failed to withdraw their statement. We are under threat for quite some time. Even on Sunday he called us up from the jail, a local daily quoted the brother-sister duo as saying.

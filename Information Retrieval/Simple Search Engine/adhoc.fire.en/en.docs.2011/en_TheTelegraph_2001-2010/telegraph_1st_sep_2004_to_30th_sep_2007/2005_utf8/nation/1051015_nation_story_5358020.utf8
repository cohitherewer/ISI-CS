 Teenagers held for Delhi rape 

 New Delhi (PTI): A 26-year-old housewife was allegedly gangraped by four teenagers in southwest Delhi, highlighting yet again the lack of security for women here. 

 All the accused have been arrested and sent to a juvenile home, police said on Friday.

 The incident took place on Sunday when the victim was on her way to a relatives house in Vasant Kunj with her younger brother. 

 The boys allegedly abducted them and took them to a nearby house where they assaulted her. The womans brother was kept tied up in another room.

 The accused later released the victim and her brother after warning them not to go to the police. But her husband lodged a complaint.

 The accused, aged 16 to 18, lived in the same locality as the woman and were arrested after she identified them.

 Gutka baron

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has rejected 

 the plea of gutka baron Jagdish Joshi, booked for alleged 

 nexus with the underworld, seeking permission to go abroad.

 The court said the CBI investigations were yet to be over and allowing him to leave the country would hamper the probe. Joshi, owner of Goa Gutka, pleaded that he had to go abroad to maintain his NRI status.

 Gun in reward

 Morena (PTI): Police have announced to 

 gift a licensed gun as reward for giving information about 

 four persons who shot at a trader and fled with Rs 4 lakh 

 from the shop of RSS district chief Ramprakash Saraf on 

 October 10. Possessing a gun is a matter of prestige in 

 the Chambal belt and police expect the reward will yield 

 result. 

 Stamp scam plea

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has rejected the plea of five accused in the stamp paper scam case, challenging their detention. They demanded release arguing that only a special court had the powers to remand them.

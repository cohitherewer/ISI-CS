 Vienna breather delights Delhi 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: India has expressed extreme happiness and relief that Irans controversial nuclear programme was not put to vote at yesterdays meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

 Delhi had voted with the West on a resolution against Iran in September at an IAEA meeting, drawing condemnation at home ? from the governments allies as well as the Opposition. The resolution envisaged referring Irans nuclear programme to the UN Security Council at an unspecified date.

 The Left, whose 60 MPs provide crucial support to the Congress-led ruling coalition, had made it clear it would oppose a fresh attempt by India to vote against Iran.

 We are extremely happy and relieved that there was no vote, a senior Indian official said this afternoon.

 The meeting of the IAEA board of governors ? of whom India is a member ? even refrained from passing a fresh resolution on Irans nuclear programme. Iran claims its programme is for peaceful purposes; but the US and Europe suspect that it is aimed at building nuclear weapons.

 Indian officials argued that though the West had the numbers on the 35-member IAEA board to refer the issue to the Security Council, the divisive move would have created fresh tensions in the already volatile region.

 South Block officials claimed that yesterdays outcome was the result of a diplomatic campaign launched by India with some other countries, including the US, several European nations, Russia and China.

 It has kept the door open for resolving the issue between Iran and the European Union-Three through negotiations, a foreign ministry official said.

 The crucial part is how negotiations between the EU-Three ? Britain, France and Germany ? and Iran, scheduled to begin early next month, progress.

 All key international players are now discussing a proposal that allows Irans enrichment programme to be outsourced to Russia. Tehran has so far been opposed to this.

 Every country has a public position. The US, the Europeans and Iran all have a public position on the issue. But it remains to be seen how flexible they are willing to be to find a solution, the Indian official added.

 India wanted, most of all, to avoid a showdown between Iran and the West. Delhi had argued during negotiations with the others that a confrontationist approach might prompt Iran to leave the nuclear non-proliferation regime and throw out IAEA inspectors from its soil.

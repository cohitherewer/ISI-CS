 Ash treks to Tirupati

 Aishwarya: Star support

Hyderabad, Jan. 13: Ringed by personal security 

guards, actor Aishwarya Rai today walked up the Tirumala hills for her first visit 

to the Balaji temple, where she claimed to have prayed for the tsunami sufferers. 

 A posse of 12 security personnel accompanied Aishwarya and her family from Mumbai and kept at bay the lensmen and reporters who pursued the entourage from the moment it arrived on a commercial flight at the Renigunta airport, 20 km from Tirupati. 

 Guards of the Tirupati Tirumala Devasthanam security joined the dozen in escorting the family on the 15-km, six-hour trek through darkness. They arrived in time for an exclusive early morning ritual at the temple. 

 As Aishwarya made her way up the Tirumala hills with the tsunami-hit on her mind, boyfriend Vivek Oberoi, who had been helping out at relief camps in Tamil Nadu, was on a pilgrimage to the hill shrine of Sabarimala in Kerala. 

 After the visit, the Bollywood beauty said she prayed for the well being of the tsunami-hit women and children, particularly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. 

 Chief priest Ramana Dikshitulu said the Rai family spent almost three hours in the temple complex. ?They participated in the tomala seva rituals since 3 am and went around all the sub-shrines in the temple complex,? he said. 

 Dharma Reddy, the joint executive officer of the temple, escorted the family to the Ranga Mandapam, one of the main halls in the complex, where they received ashirvachanam from priests, prasadam, sandal paste and a silk shawl. 

 On her way out, Aishwarya is said to have deposited bundles of currency notes and gold jewellery in the massive hundi. 

 The Rai caravan left Tirumala in three white Qualis and drove straight to the airport to catch the 11.30 am flight back to Mumbai. 

 During her visit, Aishwarya asked how much it would cost to build a cottage or a guesthouse on the hillock in her father?s name. 

 ?She expressed her interest in doing something for the pilgrims and we offered several options like cottages and anna danams,? said Reddy. She promised to consult them from Mumbai before taking a decision. 

 Temple security chief Keshava Reddy said Aishwarya had wanted to come on January 1, but was advised to postpone the visit in view of the New Year rush.

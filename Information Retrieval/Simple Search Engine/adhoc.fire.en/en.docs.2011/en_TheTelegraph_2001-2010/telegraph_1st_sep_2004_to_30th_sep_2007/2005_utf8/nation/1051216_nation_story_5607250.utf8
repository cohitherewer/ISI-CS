 Centre not evading oil scam: PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Enforcement Directorate is investigating the Iraq oil-for-food scandal, including the remarks attributed to former ambassador to Croatia Anil Mathrani, the Prime Minister told the Rajya Sabha today.

 Manmohan Singh then reminded the questioner, leader of the Opposition Jaswant Singh, that he had already made the same answer in the House in response to a query by the same member.

 The Prime Ministers terse reply came after Jaswant asked him to clarify his previous statement in the House relating to Mathranis alleged remarks implicating former foreign minister Natwar Singh in the scam.

 The Prime Minister told Jaswant the Centre wasnt evading the Iraqi oil scandal and that the Enforcement Directorate had taken note of Mathranis claims as published by a magazine.

 The matter is under investigation. There is nothing more for me to state, Manmohan Singh said.

 He then pointed out that his earlier statement had mentioned that the directorate would take cognisance of the statements attributed to Mathrani. He added that he had been forced to make that statement, too, by the leader of the Opposition.

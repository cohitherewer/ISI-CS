 Finance tough stand

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 5: The finance department of the Orissa government has said the proposal to employ family members of deceased employees would be implemented subject to its pre-condition to abolish 75 per cent base level posts in the state administration.

 The finance department ? through a recent notification ? made it clear that the departments, which have not met its pre-condition, should not send the proposal. The letter addressed to the secretaries of the departments concerned said they should first ensure 75 per cent abolition of base level posts by March 1, 2004 and make necessary intimation to this effect, after which they could send the proposal.

 In 2001, the government had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Centre in order to avail of a structural adjustment loan of Rs 3,000 crore from the World Bank and an aid of Rs 200 crore from the British government?s department of international development. 

 According to the MoU, the government had to downsize the civil administration by 20 per cent by 2004-05, continue the ban on creation of new posts and abolish the vacant ones, introduce an attractive voluntary retirement scheme, defer leave encashment and LTC and release dearness allowance judiciously. 

 The government has stopped fresh recruitment in view of a funds crunch. But during the winter session of the Orissa Assembly, members of many parties had urged the government to lift the ban on grounds of compassion. Speaker Maheswar Mohanty had directed it to make necessary arrangements to this effect at the earliest.

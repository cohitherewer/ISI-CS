 Ignored Mamata stays out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: Mamata Banerjee must be the only member of Parliament who has barred herself from setting foot in the House. The entire winter session has passed without the Trinamul Congress chief putting in a single appearance.

 Mamata attributes her peculiar behaviour to her being ignored. 

 I wrote a letter (to Speaker Somnath Chatterjee). I have not yet received a reply. How can I go back to the House unless my concerns are addressed? she asked.

 The letter Mamata is referring to is the one-page resignation she had flung towards the Speakers chair during the monsoon session. On August 4, Mamata wanted to raise the issue of Bangladeshi infiltration in Bengal. Deputy Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal, who was then presiding over the House, disallowed her request, making her furious. She hurled a bunch of papers at the chair and marched out of the Lok Sabha, promising never to return.

 However, Chatterjee rejected the resignation as it had not been submitted in a proper format. Mamata is now cribbing that she has not even been shown the courtesy of a reply.

 Closed-circuit TV to monitor Taj

 Agra (PTI): Closed-circuit TV cameras 

 will soon be installed in Taj Mahal to monitor the movement 

 of visitors. 

 The decision was taken at a meeting between the Archaeological Survey of India director-general C. Babu Rajeev and Central Industrial Security Force inspector-general Radhakrishnan Kinne on Tuesday.

 The CISF, which is in charge of the internal security of the monument, had suggested the need for a closed-circuit TV surveillance in and around the Taj.

 The ASI director-general, however, did not approve of the suggestion to have armed bunkers at the eastern and southern gates of the Taj as these would spoil the look of the entrance, officials said.

 Security arrangements were beefed up following apprehensions of threat to the 17th century Mughal monument. 

 Uttar Pradesh police, guarding the outer circle of the Taj, had recently suggested setting up of watchtowers and round-the-clock patrolling.

 The four persons were intercepted at Sarai Rohilla following a tip-off, they said.

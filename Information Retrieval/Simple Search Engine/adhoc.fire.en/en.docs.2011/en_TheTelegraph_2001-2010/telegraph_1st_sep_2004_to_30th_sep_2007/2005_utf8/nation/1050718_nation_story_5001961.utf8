 Pilgrim town in attack glare 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 17: A small pilgrim town that draws hundreds of Muslim devotees every day is where the Ayodhya militants had set up base in Akbarpur, police suspect.

 Kichaucha has a century-old mazar, flanked by a semicircle of rooms converted into guesthouses for pilgrims, who come from places as far as Bangladesh, United Arab Emirates, Iran and Pakistan.

 The town with its maze of lanes and by-lanes is also a prime hiding place for the regions gangsters, many of whom have been shot dead by the police in encounters on its outskirts. 

 The Intelligence Branch believes that the pilgrimage centre is also a hotbed of ISI infiltration and intrigue.

 Uttar Pradesh polices special task force (STF) picked up four persons in the town yesterday, hoping for leads on the six militants who spent the last 10 days before the Ayodhya attack in Akbarpur.

 One of the suspects owns a car that ferries pilgrims from Akbarpur station to Kichaucha 12 km away. 

 Two are local guides and the fourth is suspected to have issued a SIM card to the militants.

 The police have learnt that the four had been seen in the company of some foreign pilgrims from June 29 onwards. The militants who attacked the Ayodhya complex on July 5 have been described as very fair and Kashmiri-looking.

 The STF suspects the militants had lain low in the town for a few days. Sometimes pilgrims stay here for weeks, fortnights ? even longer, an STF officer said. The militants might have been posing as pilgrims.

 At Akbarpur station, the Kichaucha Mazar Trust receives the religious tourists, registers them and provides them with guides to the town.

 On July 7, four Muslim STF personnel arrived in the town posing as pilgrims and stayed for two days to try and find out if the militants had been here. They checked the register for entries made on June 25-26, when the militants should have reached the town, but it was impossible to pinpoint six signatures among so many.

 Third barricade

 The standing committee on Ayodhya security is examining a proposal to build a third barricade inside the yellow (outer) zone. The move will require permission from the Supreme Court.

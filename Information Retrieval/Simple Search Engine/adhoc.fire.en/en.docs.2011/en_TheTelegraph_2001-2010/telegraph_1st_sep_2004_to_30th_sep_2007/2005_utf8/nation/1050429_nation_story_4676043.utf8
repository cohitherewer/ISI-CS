 Orissa water tariff hike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 28: Institutional, commercial and industrial establishments under 103 urban local bodies of Orissa will have to fork out more for water.

 The cabinet, which met here on Tuesday, decided to raise the water tariff from Rs 5.64 to Rs 8 per day for institutional and commercial houses. For industrial houses, the rate has been revised from Rs 4.83 to Rs 8.

 The cabinet spared domestic consumers, for whom the rate is Rs 2.42 per day.

 This is the first time the state has hiked the water rates since 1996. Though the rates need to be raised by 5 per cent every year, successive governments have failed to do so, thereby adding to the already-heavy financial pressure on the urban development department.

 ?The amount of money spent on supplying water to people in the urban areas is much higher than what the department collects as water cess,? urban development minister K.V. Singhdeo said. 

 In 2003-04, the department spent Rs 68.62 crore while it earned only Rs 18.3 lakh. Following the hike, it intends to generate Rs 20 crore per year.

 The cabinet has also revised the sewerage tariff for industrial, commercial and institutional houses. From now on, they would have to pay Rs 100 per month instead of the previous Rs 20. 

 Besides, the sewerage connection charges have also been hiked. It is Rs 2,500 (earlier Rs 2,000) for institutional and Rs 3,500 (earlier Rs 2,500) for commercial and industrial enterprises.

 Domestic consumers would now have to pay Rs 20 every month for sewerage.

 While the government has not hiked the domestic tariff, the quality of the water leaves much to be desired. 

 According to the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, more than 2,100 people died of water-borne diseases between March 2001 and March 2004. 

 While 4.96 lakh people were affected with acute diarrhoea, another 29,000 suffered from jaundice during the period. The report had rapped the government for its failure to provide safe water.

 According to a study, water collected from different sources in Puri in July 2001 contained nitrate above the prescribed level.

 The government has also been in the firing line for its inability to ensure the adequate supply of water in areas under 88 local urban bodies.

 Club doors still shut on Saran

 Saran: No gain

 Washington, May 20: Foreign secretary Shyam Saran has failed to get any US commitment on support for Indias bid for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.

 US secretary of state Condoleezza Rices ambassador on UN reform, Shirin Tahir-Kheli, is to, however, continue Indo-US efforts to find common ground on the issue by continuing bilateral discussions during Tahir-Khelis visit to New Delhi in a few days.

 Sarans bid for US support for New Delhi on UN reform came three days after India and three other aspirants decided in New York to advance the timetable for their bid for permanent seats at the UNs high table.

 The foreign secretary arrived in Washington on the very day when India, Japan, Germany and Brazil circulated their draft resolution on Security Council expansion at the UN headquarters.

 His visit is to prepare the ground for Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs meeting here in July with President George W. Bush, but a considerable part of Sarans time here has been taken up by discussions on UN reform.

 During an interaction with Indian correspondents here before concluding his visit, Saran tried to put a positive spin to Indo-US differences on this issue by insisting that Washington is still formulating its stance on Security Council reform.

 He was defensive about the possibility that the Bush administration may eventually not support India at all in its bid to enter the Security Council, when he said the Prime Ministers visit to the US could not become hostage to a single issue.

 Saran conceded that we (India and the US) did not come to the point of discussing veto power for any new permanent members to be admitted into the council.

 But he said there was readiness in Washington to engage India in all aspects of reforming the world body.

 India will be the first country that Tahir-Kheli will be visiting to discuss UN reform since her appointment to her new job in New York.

 Saran said US support for Japans case for a permanent seat in the Security Council is not new and parried queries about Beijings opposition to the draft resolution tabled by India and others by saying that it is up to the Chinese government to spell out where it stood on the draft resolution.

 Even as Saran was giving out his version of talks with the Americans, state department spokesman Richard Boucher said as far as the Security Council itself, let me remind you, the only nation that we have endorsed is Japan.

 Our support does not indicate support for any particular option and we will consider the various proposals that are out there, including the so-called Group of Four that has been discussed.

 But we have made no further judgements about who else should or should not be added to the council, nor have we taken a position pro or con on any of these specific proposals at this point, he said.

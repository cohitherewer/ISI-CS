 US in democracy tango

 Singh and Bush at the White House in July

 Washington, Sept. 23: At long last, India and the US have found a common cause which the Pakistanis may not want to convert into a bandwagon and jump into.

 But it has so far cost taxpayers in India and America $10 million each and the price tag on their joint effort may go up if the initiative is to be sustained over many years to come.

 Yesterday, Indias ministry of external affairs (MEA) and the US state department together unveiled separate, but mutually connected, virtual Coordination and Information Centres in their respective countries to share best practices on democracy, identify opportunities for joint support and highlight capacity-building training programmes.

 The opening of these virtual centres is a follow-up to a declaration by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President George W. Bush here on July 18 to assist other societies in transition seeking to become more open and democratic.

 By any yardstick, that should include Pakistan.

 Spreading democracy worldwide was the central theme of Bushs inaugural address when he was sworn in as President for a second four-year term on January 20 this year.

 But on his own, Bush has not made much progress in this cause: some despotic allies of Americahave taunted his ideal with mock elections, others have held him to ransom with threats of being thrown out of military bases in their territory and Pakistan has taken huge amounts of US money in the name of democracy only to buy new military uniforms for the soldiers and generals in power.

 By tying up with the largest democracy in the world, Bush may now be hoping for greater credibility worldwide in promoting his ideal, because, unlike the US, India does not preach democracy to the rest of the world.

 Nor does India practise the notorious American double standards on democracy when it comes to those who are friendly with Washington or against it, the latest example of which was a call by an ally of Bush to kill Hugo Chavez, the democratically elected president of Venezuela.

 Smartly, the MEA on its virtual Coordination and Information Centre website has confined Indias global democracy initiatives to what it is doing to prod Afghanistan along the road to adult franchise.

 The MEA has avoided any references to Indias long-standing involvement in the Stockholm-based Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an equally laudable and result-oriented multilateral democracy initiative.

 The strategy is smart because it is likely that Americans and their friends are most likely to use the newly-unveiled virtual Coordination and Informationcentre.

 Advertising Indias efforts in Afghanistan in support of democracy means New Delhi can get a lot of goodwill for those efforts with these people, unlike, say what it is doing with the French in Africa.

 When Singh met Bush at the White House in July, the two leaders agreed that they share a fundamental commitment to democracy and believe they have an obligation to the global community to strengthen values, ideals and practices of freedom, pluralism, and rule of law.

 As proof of that commitment, they both pledged a contribution of $10 million each to the Democracy Fund under UN auspices.

 The latest Indo-US effort is reminiscent of the Clinton administrations initiative in 1999 to create a Community of Democracies worldwide in what was envisaged as a new global alliance.

 At this communitys first ministerial meeting in Warsaw in 2000, Clintons secretary of state Madeleine Albright tried to persuade then external affairs minister Jaswant Singh to head this group.

 Singh declined, aware that identifying too much with the US on democracy can be a double-edged sword.

 Judging from its virtual Coordination and Information Centre, South Block has that experience still in mind and is treading cautiously despite being liberal with its purse strings.

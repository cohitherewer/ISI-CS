 Kitchen to cabinet

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, July 8: From a demure housewife in a large family, busy cooking stuffed bhindis or watching saas-bahu soaps, Krishna Gaur has rocketed to the post of chairperson of the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation. 

 Chief minister Babulal Gaurs daughter-in-law looks set to be his heir apparent though she is not even a rupee member (another name for primary member) of the party, if state BJP sources are to be believed. 

 Krishna, whose husband Purshottam ? Gaurs only son ? died suddenly after a cardiac arrest, has been accorded cabinet rank with yesterdays appointment. She will succeed Nitish Bhardwaj, who played Krishna in the teleserial Mahabharat.

 Krishnas grooming began when Purshottam died, barely a month after Gaur replaced Uma Bharti as chief minister. A crestfallen Gaur looked around for support and within weeks, Krishna became his constant companion. 

 Leader of the Opposition Jamuna Devi was quick to target Gaurs daughter-in-law, dubbing her an extra-constitutional authority. Devi wrote to governor Balram Jakhar last week, complaining that Krishna was interfering in government work and often giving directions to senior officials. 

 The Opposition leader wanted to know Krishnas locus standi to issue directives. Yesterday, Devi said she had got the answer.

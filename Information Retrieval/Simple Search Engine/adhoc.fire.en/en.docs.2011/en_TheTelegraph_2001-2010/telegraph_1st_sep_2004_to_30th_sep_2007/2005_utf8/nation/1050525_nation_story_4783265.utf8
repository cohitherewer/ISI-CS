 Manipur stands up to rebels

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, May 24: Residents of Yairipok in Thoubal district today responded overwhelmingly to the call for a general strike in protest against a militant attack, removing doubts about whether anybody could stand up to the parallel government that armed groups are supposed to be running there.

 The exhibition of people power is the first instance of a public backlash against any militant group since insurgency struck roots in Manipur in the late seventies. 

 Protests in the state have been invariably directed against security forces and the government. The most recent agitation culminated in the government agreeing to gradually replace the Bengali script with the Meitei one.

 The 24-hour general strike in Yairipok since midnight yesterday was provoked by the militant Peoples United Liberation Front, whose activists hurled a bomb at a shop on Sunday because its owner had refused to donate money to their organisation. The fire caused by the blast singed three more shops, destroying goods worth over Rs 10 lakh.

 Three organisations ? the All Yairipok United Clubs Organisation, the Apunba Meira Paibi Lup and the Yairipok unit of the All Manipur Students Union ? announced a general strike to protest the attack but doubts remained over whether residents would dare to go against an armed group. 

 But all shops at Yairipok Bazar and educational institutions remained closed throughout the day. Bus services were suspended, too.

 An official source in Thoubal said the situation in Yairipok was tense but under control. Security has been beefed up to prevent a retaliatory militant attack.

 The Peoples United Liberation Front has been involved in a series of recent incidents. Activists of the organisation had hurled a bomb at a bus on the Imphal-Moreh highway a few months ago.

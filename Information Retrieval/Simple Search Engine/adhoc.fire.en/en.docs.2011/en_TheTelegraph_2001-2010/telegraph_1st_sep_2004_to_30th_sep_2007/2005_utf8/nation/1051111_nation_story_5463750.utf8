 Mumbai, Nov. 10: Two months after her arrest on the charge of allegedly plotting a conspiracy to murder film-maker Madhur Bhandarkar, starlet Preeti Jain returned to Bollywood to champion the cause of AIDS awareness.

 Jain, now on bail, shot for a five-minute film, Shock at Film City on Wednesday. Shock is a poignant film on AIDS. It shows how a male character takes advantage of a girl and contracts AIDS. It is not (a) preachy film and highlights how India is becoming permissive and that permissiveness could lead to a fatal disease, she said.

 Made by a rookie director, the film, starring TV actor Hemant Pandey with Jain, could be screened at the Goa International Film Festival scheduled later this month.

 Jain has also launched a production company, Preeti Jain Arts, and registered it with the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association. 

 I am working on a very ambitious feature film project. I would not like to talk about it at this juncture, said Jain, who had accused Bhandarkar of sexually exploiting her on the pretext of marrying her and giving her a lead role in his film. She was later arrested for issuing a contract to murder him.

 Jain was arrested on September 10 along with Naresh Pardeshi, an associate of don-turned-MLA Arun Gawli. Police alleged that she paid Rs 75,000 to hire goons to murder Bhandarkar.The police arrested four others in connection with the case.

 Jain and Pardeshi were also sent to Bangalore for narco-analysis and lie detector tests.

 Jain denied the charges and said the police had no evidence against her.

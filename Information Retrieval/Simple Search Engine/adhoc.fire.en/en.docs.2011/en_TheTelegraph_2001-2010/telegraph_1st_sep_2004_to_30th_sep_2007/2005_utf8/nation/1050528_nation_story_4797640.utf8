 Ulfa blasts after Delhi offer

 OUR BUREAU

 Guwahati/Dibrugarh, May 27: Delhi agreed to discuss the banned Ulfas core demand, sovereignty, on a night when activists of the militant group were out destroying power transformers and a bridge that links Assam and parts of Arunachal Pradesh.

 Writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami, who is mediating between Delhi and the outfit, today announced that the long-awaited reply to Ulfas conditions for a dialogue was delivered to her last night. 

 That was a few hours before three explosions rocked Tinsukia district of Upper Assam, breaking a vital communication link, completely destroying a transformer and partially damaging another. 

 Goswami said she forwarded the letter from the Prime Ministers Office (PMO), which is addressed to Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, with a covering note asking the militant group to take it seriously.

 National security adviser M.K. Narayanan has written the letter and I am satisfied with its contents. It addresses the issue that has been the stumbling block in the peace process till now, she said. 

 Ulfa had ignored the previous letter from the PMO on the ground that it did not categorically mention sovereignty. 

 The Delhi-based writer and teacher said she was hopeful of a breakthrough this time. I have informed them (the Ulfa leaders) that the PMO is willing to clarify any doubts they may have about the letter. 

 Delhis climbdown and Goswamis positive outlook presented a stark contrast to the situation on the ground. 

 Ulfa militants targeted the two transformers of the Assam State Electricity Board at Bordirak and Harudirak villages, about 15 km from Kakopathar police station, sometime after midnight. 

 A third explosion occurred about 12 km from the same police station, destroying a major portion of an iron bridge over Maithong river. The incident snapped Assams road links with Lohit district and most parts of eastern Arunachal Pradesh. 

 A concrete bridge is being constructed alongside the old one.

 A source said the saboteurs overpowered the seven guards deployed in the area and fixed explosives under the bridge. 

 They did not harm the guards and set them free minutes before the blast occurred around 1.50 am.

 A 34-member Ulfa team led by Jiten Dutta, the deputy operations commander of the outfits crack 28 Battalion, and a hitman identified as Joon Bhuyan are suspected to be behind the orgy of violence.

 Cong ear to ground

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, May 31: Although young and callow, they had seen farther than Sonia Gandhi and Arjun Singh had.

 Ignored by the Congress leadership, they had felt vindicated while watching helplessly as the partys Bihar and Jharkhand poll strategies, designed by veteran colleagues, went horribly wrong three months ago.

 Now the All India Congress Committees department of policy planning and co-ordination (Depco) is back at work, ear pressed to the ground to help the party chalk out a strategy for the next election in Bihar. This time the so-called think-tank may get more attention.

 Before and during the February polls, party MP Pallam Raju from Andhra Pradesh, who heads Depco, is believed to have regularly sent to the Congress chief his departments findings, showing up the weaknesses of the partys poll strategies in Bihar and Jharkhand. 

 Though their content was ignored, Raju is believed to have been told to avoid leakage of his reports to the media.

 The department has earlier, too, failed to receive the importance it deserved. 

 Soon after helping evolve, under the guidance of Salman Khursheed, the partys successful 2004 Lok Sabha poll strategy, it had been in danger of being wound up. 

 Congress bigwigs had lost interest in the department and wanted to convert its office into a library.

 Managing to survive that and putting behind it the February elections, the department had already begun focusing on the states going to polls next ? Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Bengal and Pondicherry ? when the Bihar House was dissolved.

 While these planners may be relied on to provide useful inputs ? sometimes even performing the role of pollsters and undertaking pre-poll surveys ? to her, Sonia also has the task of putting together a new team to draw up the partys strategy for the fresh Bihar polls.

 It is widely believed that Arjun Singh and M.L. Fotedar, architects of the Bihar strategy the previous time, will be replaced by leaders more inclined to do business with allies.

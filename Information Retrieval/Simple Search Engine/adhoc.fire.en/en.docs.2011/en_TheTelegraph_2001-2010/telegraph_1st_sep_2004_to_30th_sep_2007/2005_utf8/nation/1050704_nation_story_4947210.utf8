 Job bonus for poor families 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, July 3: Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has made a vital addition to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill by declaring that a person from below the poverty line will not be refused work even if someone else from the same family is already working under the scheme.

 No one will be refused work on the premise that someone from that family already has been given work, the minister said at a convention yesterday. The bill, though, states that only one member from each family living below the poverty line will receive guaranteed employment for 100 days.

 Singh also said those employed under the scheme would receive wages according to the states Minimum Wages Act, 1948. 

 Several organisations campaigning for the right to work have demanded a uniform minimum wage. But Singh said political compulsions would come in the way. Kerala has a minimum wage of Rs 120 per day, while the amount in the Northeast is Rs 40 per day. A uniform wage rate would result in huge political opposition and the bill may not get passed at all, he said.

 The bill in all likelihood will be passed by August, Singh said, hinting at October 2 as the day of its implementation.

 The minister also declined the CPI-backed organisation, National Federation of Indian Womens demand for a womens quota within the bill.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said the bill, when it is passed, would be the first step towards the universal right to employment but cautioned on the implementation. Once the bill gets passed, the real challenge will be its implementation. There is a long battle ahead, he said.

 Govt defends governor sack

 R. VENKATARAMAN 

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: The Centre has claimed in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court that the ?term of office of five years for a governor is subject to the doctrine of pleasure of the President? provided for in Article 156(1) of the Constitution. 

 The affidavit was filed on Friday in response to a notice on a public interest litigation filed by former BJP parliamentarian B.P. Singhal, challenging the removal of four governors appointed during the National Democratic Alliance regime. 

 The home ministry said: ?The five-year tenure is not absolute and can be abridged at the pleasure of the President.? The President ?shall act under the advice of the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister?, it added. Thus, the affidavit implied that the Centre had unfettered powers to order the removal of governors that could not be questioned in a court of law. 

 In July 2004, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government removed Kailashpati Mishra, Kidar Nath Sahani, Babu Parmanand and Vishnu Kant Shastri as governors of Gujarat, Goa, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh respectively. 

 Admitting the petition challenging this ?arbitrary? removal, the Supreme Court had sought a reply from the Centre. While filing the affidavit, the Centre sought dismissal of Singhal?s petition on the ground that it was ?misconceived?. 

 The Centre stated in its affidavit that the court ?could not? question the removal of governors ?in view of the bar of Article 361(1) of the Constitution granting immunity to the President?. It denied the allegation that the four governors were removed due to ?ideological differences?. 

 The affidavit said the petitioner?s allegation that the governors were removed over ideological differences was apparently ?based on some media reports and not on facts?. 

 The Constitution neither specified any ground for revoking the pleasure of the President resulting in the removal of a governor nor any procedure for removal, the Centre added. 

 On the contention that the Sarkaria Commission had recommended that a governor?s five-year tenure should not be disturbed except for some compelling reasons, the Centre said this recommendation did not mean that a governor should get a fixed tenure of office for five years under all circumstances. 

 It further said the President did not need to mention any ground for revoking his pleasure to remove a governor.

 Ministries in Bangla brawl

 - Pipeline sops spark row, petro mandarin off Natwar team

 (Top) Singh, Aiyar: 

 Gas blast

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: Indias difficult neighbour Bangladesh appears to have driven a wedge between South Block and the petroleum and natural gas ministry.

 The ministry of external affairs is upset at what it sees as an attempt by the petroleum ministry to encroach on its turf to ensure that Dhaka allows gas from Myanmar to pass through its territory and reach India.

 A memorandum of understanding on the proposed India-Myanmar-Bangladesh gas pipeline was signed by the three countries in Yangon in January this year. 

 At that time, the petroleum ministry gave major concessions to Dhaka and dragged Indo-Bangladeshi bilateral issues into what was essentially a trilateral agreement, South Block sources said.

 The petroleum ministry representatives assured Dhaka that Delhi will take steps to close the huge trade deficit between the two sides. They also promised that Dhaka will be allowed to tap power from Bhutan and Nepal and reach its goods to these countries through India.

 The foreign ministry feels that Mani Shankar Aiyars petroleum ministry has not only exceeded its brief but has also made Indias future dealings with its intransigent neighbour difficult.

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh is scheduled to go to Dhaka on a three-day visit from August 6 in what is being dubbed as a goodwill trip by both sides. This will be Singhs first visit to Bangladesh since he took up his current office in May last year.

 But the problems between his ministry and that of Aiyar seem to have worsened on the eve of the visit and are reported to have reached even the highest political level.

 The additional secretary in the petroleum ministry, Talmiz Ahmed, has been dropped from the foreign ministers delegation. The official reason is that Ahmed, who is from the foreign ministry and had served as Indias ambassador to Saudi Arabia a few years ago, has been asked to go to Riyadh as part of the delegation to King Fahds funeral.

 Sources, however, said the official was dropped from Singhs team to make sure that the bilateral commitments the petroleum ministry has made to Dhaka remain out of the spotlight during the visit. Bangladesh has tied progress on the pipeline to Delhi fulfilling its commitments.

 The petroleum ministry is not competent to go ahead and give a bilateral commitment on a trilateral agreement, a foreign ministry official said.

 South Block sources said Aiyars ministry should have consulted the foreign ministry and the Indian high commission in Dhaka before making the commitments, which will now be used by Bangladesh whenever bilateral issues are discussed.

 These fears grew when Dhaka refused to send a representative to a trilateral meeting in Delhi on the gas pipeline project.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is keen to improve relations with Bangladesh. But serious doubts have been raised by some foreign ministry officials on whether Dhaka wants to reciprocate.

 These officials cite how Bangladesh had tried to scuttle the free trade agreement between Bimstec members, as well as the Asian Highway Network.

 Last month, however, India and Myanmar discussed routes that bypass Bangladesh for laying the transnational pipeline.

 Aiyar said these routes were discussed to keep all options open, for Bangladesh was posing problems relating to the pipeline.

 Myanmar energy minister Brigadier General Lun Thi said the offshore A-1 block in India was still being developed. Therefore, it would take some years for the gas to flow to India. Laying the pipeline and setting up the distribution network will also take some time, he added.

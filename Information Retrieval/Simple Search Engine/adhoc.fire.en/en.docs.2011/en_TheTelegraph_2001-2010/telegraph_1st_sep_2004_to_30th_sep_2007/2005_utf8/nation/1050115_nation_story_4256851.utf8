 Bihar vote-split fear, image cheer for BJP

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: The decision of the Congress and Ram Vilas Paswan to part ways with Laloo Prasad Yadav and fight most of the seats in the Bihar Assembly election on their own is being perceived by the BJP as a double-edged weapon. 

 The party believes the image projected by the National Democratic Alliance of a ?house in perfect order? and that of the United Progressive Alliance as a divided one may enhance the credibility of its slogan of the NDA being the only alternative to Laloo Prasad?s ?jungle raaj?. But there is also the fear that the anti-Laloo votes could split again.

 ?Everything depends on how the Congress? and Paswan?s campaigns pan out, whether they attack Laloo Prasad or the BJP and the Janata Dal (United),? said Bhagalpur MP and BJP leader Sushil Modi. If Laloo Prasad became their poll theme, Modi conceded that it would be advantage RJD because his core voters would reconsolidate if their leader was besieged. If it was the NDA, the alliance?s voters would regroup to counter the ?attack?.

 BJP?s Bihar in-charge and spokesperson Arun Jaitley said ?we will capture the alternative political space through our campaign? by stressing on the NDA being the ?only stable and surviving political alliance?. ?Others are in a disarray over seat-sharing. We have finalised it without a problem. We will have a joint campaign, which will harp on one point: Bihar needs change and that change can be brought only by a party or coalition that has not compromised itself with the RJD and the UPA. The NDA is intact and represents the deep-seated desire for change.?

 Sources said underlying Jaitley?s assertion was the feedback from the Bihar unit that if the Congress and Paswan started attacking Laloo Prasad in their campaigns and put up upper-caste candidates (the Congress especially), the NDA would be hurt. 

 ?The Congress is prone to doing this. It puts up Bhumihars, Rajputs and Brahmins against our candidates. While it has no base vote or infrastructure left, the upper-caste votes get disturbed because of the individual candidates,? a source said.

 Therefore, the NDA?s endeavour will be to show up the Congress as a ?bahuroopiya? (a multi-faced entity). ?The Congress is a pawn in the RJD?s hands and playing the role of a vote katwa (vote divider),? said Modi. 

 A ?vote katwa? is the ultimate insult in the state?s political dictionary.

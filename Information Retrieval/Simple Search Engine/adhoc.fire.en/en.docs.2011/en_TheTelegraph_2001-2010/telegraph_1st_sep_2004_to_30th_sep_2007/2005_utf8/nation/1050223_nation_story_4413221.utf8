 Haryana count back on Feb 27

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Supreme Court today ordered that counting of votes in Haryana should be taken up on February 27, overruling the Election Commission?s directive advancing the date to February 23.

 A three-judge bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices D.M. Dharmadhikari and P.K. Balasubramanyan pointed out to poll panel counsel S.K. Mendiratta that counting should be taken up only after the election process is complete. Since the postal votes would not be received by Wednesday, counting could not start then, it added.

 Mendiratta responded that the commission had no objection to taking up counting on February 27 as earlier scheduled, which the court recorded in its order.

 The court clarified that this order did not cast any aspersions on the power of the commission to advance the counting dates depending on exigencies.

 Mendiratta conceded that the counting date was advanced not to meet an exigency but only to secure early release of election staff, security forces and public buildings requisitioned for keeping the ballots in safe custody.

 The commission?s order, issued on February 17, had been challenged by an Indian National Lok Dal candidate.

 Appearing for the petitioner, counsel Shanti Bhushan argued that according to the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, a returning officer has to first take into account the postal ballots and then proceed with the counting of votes. If the counting date was advanced to Wednesday, this rule would be flouted as the postal ballots would not be received by then, he added.

 The commission said it had issued nearly 77,000 postal ballots but added that only 10 to 15 per cent of such ballots usually came back as valid votes. 

 The court quashed two letters written by the commission to the chief electoral officer in Chandigarh, directing him to hold counting on February 23. The poll panel was asked to issue new directives taking into account the postal votes to be received till 8 am on February 27.

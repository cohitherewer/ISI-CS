 Panic grips councillors

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Kashmiris react as they see the body of Ramzan Mian

 Srinagar May 7: They had 

 braved militant threats to contest the Kashmir civic polls 

 and won. But three months and several killings later, the 

 states councillors are running scared.

 So far, more than half-a-dozen elected civic officials have been murdered by militants and many more have faced attacks. 

 The latest assassination ? the daylight murder of Mohammad Ramzan Mian, municipal chairman of north Kashmirs Pattan, with his three bodyguards three days ago ? has led five members of the Pattan municipal committee to resign.

 The government has provided every councillor with a personal security guard, an arrangement the officials find ?highly inadequate?. 

 They say the constant threat to their lives has thrown their routine haywire, as the focus has shifted from work to survival.

 ?We cannot stick our necks out. Threats are aplenty, but security is scarce. What am I supposed to do when my family continues to live under threat from militants?? said a woman councillor who requested not to be named.

 Their problems have worsened with the state governments decision to hold the panchayat elections over the next two months. 

 The focus of security has now shifted from the councillors to the prospective candidates for the rural polls.

 ?It is not possible to provide foolproof security to each and every councillor ? there are too many of them,? said a senior police officer. 

 ?Thats why we had suggested government accommodation for the councillors where they can stay together under strict security.?

 The councillors fear that if they opt for this, they might be unable to return to their homes for long periods. 

 Some also argue that this would prevent them from attending to the problems of their localities.

 Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has pleaded helplessness. Since watertight security cannot be provided to so many councillors, he has said, ?they should bank on the security provided by their voters?.

 The killings are likely to cast a shadow also on the upcoming panchayat polls, keeping the field narrow and the turnout poor.

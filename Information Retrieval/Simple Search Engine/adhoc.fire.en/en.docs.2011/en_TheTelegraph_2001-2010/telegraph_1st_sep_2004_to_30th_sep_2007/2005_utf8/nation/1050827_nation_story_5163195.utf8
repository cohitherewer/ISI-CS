 A month on, not a sound on voice test

 Aishwarya: Long wait

 Mumbai, Aug. 26: A Mumbai police team has left for Chandigarh to get the forensic report analysing the SalAshious tapes. However, more than a month after the Maharashtra government announced an inquiry into the controversy, the police are yet to hand in their report.

 On July 21, deputy chief minister R.R. Patil had announced the probe, by a two-member police team, into the alleged phone conversation between actors Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai, in which the male voice boasts of his links with the underworld. 

 Patil had also confirmed that the call was tapped by a crime branch unit, which had obtained permission to do so from the government.

 A probe team of additional commissioner K.L. Bishnoi and assistant commissioner Trambak Yengde was set up. The team questioned Salman at the Andheri office of the crime branch and recorded his voice sample. The team then visited Aishwaryas 12th-floor apartment at Bandras Le Mer building and recorded her voice, too.

 The officers also recorded the statements of five police officers, including encounter specialists Pradeep Sharma and Daya Nayak, and deputy commissioner Pradeep Sawant.

 The deputy commissioner had tapped Salmans mobile phone between August 27, 2001, and October 25, 2001, on suspicion that he was in contact with gangster Abu Salem.

 We are yet to complete the investigation. We cannot share any details, Bishnoi, who heads the probe team, said this evening. He refused to say how long the probe would take and when the report may be submitted to the state home ministry.

 City police commissioner Anami Roy, however, confirmed that a police team has left for Chandigarh to collect the voice analysis report from the Central Forensic Laboratory. The report will reveal whether the tape is genuine and whether the voices on it belong to Salman and Aishwarya.

 The report has not reached us yet; but someone has gone to Chandigarh to get it, Roy said.

 The probe team had made Salman and Aishwarya read out paragraphs from the Hindi text of the transcript. The readings are to be matched with the voices in the tape.

 The government, though, remains vague on what legal action might be taken after the probe is complete.

 The controversy has failed to dent Salmans fortunes at the box-office. His recent release, Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya, where he stars with Katrina Kaif, remained at the top of the charts for over four weeks.

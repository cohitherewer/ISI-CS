 Congress takes Speaker junket cue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chatterjee: Setting a trend

New Delhi, June 3: Somnath Chatterjees efforts to limit junkets by MP on parliamentary committees seem to be bearing fruit. 

 Taking cue from the Congresss strong endorsement of the Lok Sabha Speakers revised guidelines on these tours, party members are apparently opting out of the Public Accounts Committees proposed visit to Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Goa beginning tomorrow. 

 Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh, one of the partys seven nominees in the 22-member PAC, has reportedly written to the committees chairman, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, saying he would be unable to be on the trip.

 Other Congress members on the panel ? R.K. Dhawan, V. Narayansamy, A.R. Antulay, M. Sreenivasulu Reddy, Madan Lal Sharma and K.V. Thangka Balu ? are likely to follow suit. 

 A couple of days ago, Malhotra, also deputy leader of the BJP in the Lok Sabha, had stirred a controversy when he claimed that PAC members were unhappy with the Speakers revised guidelines, particularly their tone and tenor. 

 According to the guidelines, committees should undertake only tours that are absolutely necessary so as to bring about simplicity and austerity.

 Defending the new rules, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi today said the party welcomed the Speakers well-intended initiative. Many of the revised guidelines were actually in existence for long though they were not followed, he added.

 About Malhotras contention that PAC members were miffed with the guidelines, Singhvi said: If there is any genuine grievance of an MP, which would hamper discharge of duties of members, the authorities concerned would surely be open for discussions.

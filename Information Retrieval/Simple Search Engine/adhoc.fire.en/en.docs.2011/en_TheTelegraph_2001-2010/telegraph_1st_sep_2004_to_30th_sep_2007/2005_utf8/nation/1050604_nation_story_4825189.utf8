 Baby gives temple a wet face 

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 3: A temple committee that levied a fine of Rs 1,001 from a couple because their six-month-old son had urinated in the temple has been asked to return the amount.

 The committee had charged the fine to pay for cleansing the temple and performing a puja for reparation.

 Tourism and devaswom (an authority in charge of temples) minister K.C. Venugopal said it was cruel to penalise the couple. He added that if a ritual was needed to cleanse the temple, the expenses should be met from its kitty.

 The minister had asked a senior bureaucrat to inquire into the incident after Y. Anil Kumar, the boys father, sent a written complaint to him.

 On May 6, Kumar, a 33-year-old motor mechanic from Alappuzha, his wife Smita and their son Adityan, had gone to Sree Vadukumnathan temple in Thrissur. Friends and relatives had accompanied them.

 According to Kumar, Adityan wetted his mothers sari while they were praying and a few drops fell on the floor.

 When it caught the temple staffs eye, they cleared all the devotees and demanded Rs 1,001 from the couple. The devaswom officer raised the fine to Rs 2,001, saying additional expenses would be incurred for buying temple offerings.

 When Kumar asked for a receipt of the fine, the officer demanded his sons birth certificate. Finally, everyone in his group pooled in to pay the fine and proceeded to another temple at Palani in Tamil Nadu.

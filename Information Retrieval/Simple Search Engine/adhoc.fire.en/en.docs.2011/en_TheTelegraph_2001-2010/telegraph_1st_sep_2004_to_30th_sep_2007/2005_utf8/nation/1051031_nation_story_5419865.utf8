 New Delhi, Oct. 30: Tourism is the first casualty after all terrorist attacks.

 Although some foreign tourists were found moving around Paharganj, the site of one of the three blasts yesterday where budget hotels are popular with backpackers, cancellation was more the norm than checking in.

 Gulab Mishra, manager of a small hotel opposite which the blast occurred killing over a dozen people, has seen a string of foreign tourists cancel their bookings.

 Not one customer has come since yesterday, Mishra said.

 Business is down 70 per cent, and this is the beginning of the peak season. Some have cancelled, and some have delayed their arrival.

 Almost all shops in the heavily policed market opened. Were just doing our duty by opening shops. Dhanteras is over before it started, said Madan Gupta, a utensil seller.

 Not all hotels were equally hit. Foreigners are not scared nor are they checking out, said Govind Prushty of Hotel Vivek.

 I think there is a 10 per cent impact. Our guests are not checking out. Israelis especially are quite normal, said Roni Kumar, of Anoop Hotel.

 We are quite used to this in our country. We are not afraid of anything, said Anat, an Israeli.

 We are going ahead with our plans to see the country, said Moy, also an Israeli.

 A rare pat on the back for a beleaguered Delhi police came from a tourist.

 You can see the cops around. I think they are doing everything that ought to be done, said Jane.

 Most tourists have no immediate plans of moving out, but usually there is a dip in arrivals after an incident of this nature.

 Poompuhar, Jan. 14: Wisps of smoke rise from claypots heated by brick ovens in the frontyards of houses. In minutes, the new rice and milk and jaggery and condiments will boil and spill over. Children will shout ?pongal, pongal?.

 Three kilometres from the seafront, it is a festival. Pongal in Poompuhar. Noon in Poompuhar. The auspicious hour is between 1 pm and 2 pm, popular Tamil daily Dinamalar says. It is high tide, the sea is swollen. It wasn?t so intimidating at this time yesterday. In the Meenavar colony, the village of the fishing community, it is quiet. Pongal in Poompuhar. Our Pongal, their Pongal. 

 Panchayat Office. Langar khana. Sikh volunteers from Gurudwara Ratwara Sahib, Chandigarh, are making a valiant attempt to prepare pongal. The first time it is too soggy, the second time too dry. Both times, it is a lesson in national integration. The volunteers from faraway Punjab, many of whom had never glimpsed the sea before, were among the first to reach the tsunami-hit. Finally, from one of the big aluminium woks, the pongal boils and spills over, the children clap. ?Pongal, pongal.? 

 Sri Tayal Paramesvari Temple. The women are in a queue. One, two, three, four? one hundred and twenty-three. The men are waiting. There is little else to do. They are from the Meenavar colony. The district administration is distributing relief. Rice, 60 kg per family, and a bedsheet.

 Behind the queue is a long temporary shelter. Thatched roof. Yesterday, 20 families moved into the interim shelter. The rest will move out of the camp in three or four days, says P. Chandrakarasu, panchayat member. A girl in a pink ghagra choli, about 10, skips past, followed by younger boys. ?No, no, no Pongal. What Pongal!? says Chandrakarasu.

 Ravichandran, 26. ?I rowed out with my catamaran yesterday when the IAS officer came. When the tsunami hit, I was out at sea. Had left at 5 in the morning. Returned around 10 and could not find the beach. I go out to sea every other day unless I am going out with a trawler. But a trawler will go out at most 10 days in a month. I need to go out more often. The going rate for shrimp was Rs 250 per kg. Now it is down to Rs 70 per kg but there are no buyers. Pongal? Forget it.? 

 K. Jamboolingam, headman, Meenavar Panchayat. ?My boat was docked in the fishing port at Palayar, some 20 km north of here. I am ruined. The boat, named Jambu, had an Ashok Leyland 96 horsepower engine. It cost Rs 10 lakh. It used to put out to sea for 10 to 14 days a month. It took six or seven different nets. One trawl net costs between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000. The big nets Rs 25,000-30,000? A decent catch would be worth Rs 6 lakh. I would keep a third, for myself and for running expenses. Two-thirds would be shared by the fishermen. What Pongal!?

 R. Elangovan, tourist officer. ?I have been here two years. Last year, we had grand festival. We had public function on the beach in front of Eranchi Mandram (a monument) for foreigners. We showed this is how pongal is made. This year, the state government has cancelled all official festivities. Me? I stay away from the beach. My wife will cook pongal in courtyard. But we do not want to make a show of it. That is what everyone feels. How can we celebrate the festival when so many are killed and the children of the village cannot? But Pongal must be celebrated. It is part of our life. Come, after two ?clock, have some.?

 Dhurai, farmer. ?I live in Vanagiri, 3 km south near the Cauvery. My house is fine but my field is gone. My paddy, my groundnut, all gone. And for three years I will not be able to grow anything. There is sand and clay and salt in my land.? (The agriculture commissioner, T.S. Raju, says it will take fresh water to wash away the salinity.) ?I went to Poompuhar (town) and borrowed some money for Pongal. I have three children and my wife is pregnant. If there is no Pongal by us, we are finished?. 

 S. Manimeghalai. Everyone talks of her. Yesterday, after the boats returned from a symbolic trip to the sea, she auctioned a shrimp, symbolically, for Rs 200, an outrageous price. On December 26, Manimeghalai noticed the water in the ponds and wells in Poompuhar ?shaking?. It is a scientific phenomenon called ?seich? and often precedes a tsunami. She ran to the police station and people say her efforts saved at least 100 lives. Yesterday, Manimeghalai said she is too busy to celebrate Pongal. She is not to be found today. She was at the temple in the morning, at the panchayat office later, and at the relief centre still later. Someone says she is at Vanagiri, a village south of Poompuhar. She is, indeed, celebrating Pongal. At the primary health centre, telling the village folk that they have to report to the relief centre to get compensation for loss of livelihood. She is laughing too.

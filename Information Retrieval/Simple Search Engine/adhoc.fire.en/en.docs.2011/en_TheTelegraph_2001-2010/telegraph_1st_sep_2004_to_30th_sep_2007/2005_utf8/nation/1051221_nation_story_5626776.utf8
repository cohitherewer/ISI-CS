 Dons warm cops laps

 - Gangsters may be filling jails deliberately to get Mumbai toehold

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Dec. 20: Suddenly, gangsters are crawling out of every nook of the underworld in India and abroad and falling into Mumbai polices lap. And they are all on their way to jail.

 Lawkeepers on top? Even some officers think there could be another explanation.

 Jail is the most preferred destination for many (gangsters) now. It gives them the security and freedom to subvert the system by manipulating it from its safe confines, a senior police officer said.

 Those who have plotted and carried out murders now seek the intervention of human rights groups. Apparently, they can even run their business safely from jail.

 A slew of arrests had followed Abu Salems extradition, the most curious being that of his aide Naeem Khan. The man, who had eluded Indian police for 10 years, apparently rang up from Dubai, saying he wished to surrender and clear his name in the murder of builder Pradeep Jain.

 Commissioner A.N. Roy, however, said: He didnt surrender; we arrested him. If he wanted to surrender, why would it take him 10 years? We had been tracking him for the past two weeks.

 The police scored a hat-trick by arresting two other Salem men ? Riaz Siddiqui and the dons ex-driver, Mehdi Hassan ? apparently following Salems interrogation.

 The same day (December 15), the dragnet closed round two Chhota Shakeel aides. Hitman Mohammad Haroon, accused of four murders, was held from an Ahmedabad hotel. He had allegedly been trying to re-establish a foothold for Shakeel and Dawood Ibrahim in Mumbai. Another Shakeel man, Rashid Mistry, was held in Mumbai.

 Earlier, Dawood aide Noor Bux was captured in Lucknow on November 24. On December 18, the police again scored by arresting Chhota Rajans brother Prakash Nikhalje, alleged to be behind recent extortion calls to builders.

 Three days earlier, key Rajan aide D.K. Rao had been caught running an extortion racket through mobile phones from the Arthur Road jail while serving a 10-year term.

 So, on paper, the police have their fingers round the underworlds throat. But then, how could Rao and Dawoods brother Iqbal Kaskar run their show from inside Arthur Road jail?

 Many suspect that the spate of arrests means only this: the underworld is using chinks in the administrations armour to re-establish roots in Mumbai, working through lesser-known names. 

 The Rajan gang arrests should not be seen in isolation, a senior officer said. Dons like Rajan are trying to gain a foothold in Mumbai again.

 The dons may be down, but thanks to a long-winded judicial system, they seem to be running their business in Mumbai efficiently through aides, from Arthur Road jail and elsewhere.

 Probe into biryani party 

 The Mumbai Tada court where Abu Salem (Fotocorp picture above) was produced on Tuesday has ordered 

 a probe into reports of 

 a party being thrown at Arthur Road jail during 

 the don rsquo;s one-night stay there on November 23.

 The anti-terror court asked the jail superintendent 

 to submit an affidavit 

 on whether and how such a celebration was held.

 A newspaper had 

 reported that Dawood Ibrahim aides in the high-security jail had organised the feast mdash; of chicken biryani, chicken tikka and parathas specially ordered from a posh restaurant mdash; 

 to give Salem a ldquo;hero rsquo;s welcome rdquo;. The don was given foreign cigarettes.

 The host, allegedly, 

 was Bombay blasts 

 accused Mustafa Dossa 

 alias Majnu.

 The court extended 

 Salem rsquo;s judicial custody 

 in the blasts case till 

 January 3.

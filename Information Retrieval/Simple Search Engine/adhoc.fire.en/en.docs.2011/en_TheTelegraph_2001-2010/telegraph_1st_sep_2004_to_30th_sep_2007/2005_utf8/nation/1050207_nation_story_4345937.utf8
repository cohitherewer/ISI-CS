 Arjun ire for party leaders

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, Feb. 6: Union human resource development minister and senior Congress leader Arjun Singh today lashed out at the party leadership in Chhattisgarh.

 The minister launched a scathing attack on senior Congress leaders and the incumbent state committee over what he called ?deserting party activities in the state?. 

 ?I am not here to create any new political equation. But we need to pay immediate attention to the sorry state of affairs in the party here as the Congress is losing support among the people of Chhattisgarh,? he said at a party workers? convention here. 

 Singh later told reporters that he would frequently visit the state as ?Congress workers need to be made active in the larger interests of the party?. 

 Without naming anyone, Singh said some leaders in Chhattisgarh believe that they are above the party. This was the sole reason behind the Congress losing its base in the state, he added. 

 The absence of state Pradesh Congress Committee chief and AICC treasurer Motilal Vora, senior partymen Ajit Jogi and Shyamacharan Shukla in the party functions attended by Singh was enough to indicate that the house is certainly not in order.

 ?I had informed the PCC chief about my visit. I don?t know why the senior leaders did not share the dais with me at the official functions,? Singh said. 

 On the other hand, a section of Congress leaders, known to be supporters of Singh, was visibly excited with the minister?s visit. Singh?s supporters said they can set up a strong base for their leader in the state. 

 The political turf is not new to Singh, who, in the early Eighties, had won an Assembly election from Kharsia, then in Madhya Pradesh. But he later chose to stay away from Chhattisgarh politics for more than a decade. 

 Singh did not visit Chhattisgarh even when Ajit Jogi took over as chief minister. ?Singh now wants to stir the cauldron in the home turf of the likes of Ajit Jogi,? a supporter of Singh told The Telegraph. 

 ?The timing could not have been better ? the Congress faced a humiliating defeat under the current crop of leaders, right from state polls to civic body elections,? he added. 

 Shifting his attention to the ?saffron brigade?, Singh said, ?I have received complaints that the government has appointed members of the RSS under the Sarva Siksha programme in the state.? 

 ?We will not give a single penny to the state if it continues to work on the RSS ideology,? he warned.

 Jaya heat on DMK

 Chennai, March 18: The Jayalalithaa government today accused the DMK of packing cooperative banks with supporters during its tenure and alleged they had fomented irregularities worth over Rs 200 crore, reports our special correspondent.

 ?The cooperative banks packed with DMK men in elected management committees reeked of corruption and financial irregularities ? from the top-level Apex State Cooperative Bank to the bottom-most tier of primary agriculture cooperative banks (PACBs),? cooperation, food and consumer protection minister Pollachi V. Jayaraman said in the Assembly.

 The minister was answering a debate on the demand for grants for departments under his charge.

 Jayaraman alleged that the M. Karunanidhi regime of 1996-2001 had made appointments to cooperative banks flouting procedures and allowed politically influential DMK functionaries to control loan sanctions. All this, along with fixing favourable remuneration for top-level personnel, had combined to push Tamil Nadu?s cooperative banking sector deeper into the red, he said.

 The irregularities, Jayaraman said, had come to light after the ADMK government ordered a ?100 per cent audit?.

 The minister alleged that nearly Rs 125 crore had been sanctioned to ?benamis (proxies)? of DMK members on bank managements in the disbursal of crop loans alone by the PACBs.

 He further alleged that irregularities worth Rs 26.93 crore had been detected in ?consumer loans? and Rs 65.34 crore more in sanctions by urban cooperative banks during the same period.

 The Jayalalithaa government, the minister said, had so far initiated legal action against 17,755 people for the irregularities and slapped offenders with penalties worth Rs 51.21 crore, of which Rs 14.62 crore had already been collected.

 DMK veteran Arcot N. Veeraswamy objected to the sweeping charges made against his party. The government, he said, could take action against the DMK workers concerned if there were specific cases of irregularities against them.

 Veeraswamy, however, emphasised that if these were cases of non-payment of cooperative bank loans, the government alone would be responsible in recovering them.

 He demanded to know what the government was doing about the huge outstanding loans of scheduled commercial banks.

 Veeraswamy further demanded that the Opposition be allowed to reply if the minister was being permitted to respond to ?certain cases pending before the courts and to certain other allegations made outside the Assembly?.

 The reference was to the DMK regime?s procurement of high-moisture-content rice from farmers that later turned rotten, and to the alleged irregularities in the present government?s purchase of gunnybags to stock paddy.

 Speaker K. Kalimuthu said Jayaraman had only mentioned the issues, ?without going into the merits of the case or the charges?.

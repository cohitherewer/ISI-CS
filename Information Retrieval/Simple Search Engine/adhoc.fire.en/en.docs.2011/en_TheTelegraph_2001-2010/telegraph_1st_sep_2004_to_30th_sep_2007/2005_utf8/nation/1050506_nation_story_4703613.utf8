 Tiffin tussle turns fatal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, May 5: A Class 

 X student of a city school died after being injured in a 

 scuffle with a classmate this afternoon over a tiffin box.

 Chandmari police have registered a case of unnatural death on the basis of a complaint filed by the Maharishi Vidya Mandir at Silpukhuri and detained Madhurjya Bora, the classmate of the 15-year-old victim, Udipta Sarma, for questioning. Three other students and some teachers were also quizzed.

 At the Barsojai branch of the school, Ishani Choudhury ? a student of Class IV ? was injured when she fell after being pushed by a fellow student inside a toilet. She was taken to the GNRC Hospital where she has been kept under observation.

 The police said trouble started at the Silpukhuri school during the lunch recess at 12.40 pm when the tiffin box of a student went missing. ?According to the students, Madhurjya accused Udipta of stealing the tiffin box, which led to a heated argument. In the scuffle that followed, Udipta was hurt in his neck and fell unconscious,? police said.

 He was declared brought dead at a nursing home.

 Deputy inspector-general of police (criminal investigation) A. Rajkumar said the incident was the result of a scuffle between the students over a tiffin box but did not comment on the cause of death.

 ?The cause of the death will only be known once we get the post-mortem report,? he said. The post-mortem will be done at the Gauhati Medical College Hospital tomorrow.

 The deputy commissioner of Kamrup (metro), Samir Kumar Sinha, has called for reports from the police and the school.

 ?I can only say that one of our students met with an accident and subsequently died. The accident took place because of a tussle,? said the vice-principal of the school, Sujata Goswami.

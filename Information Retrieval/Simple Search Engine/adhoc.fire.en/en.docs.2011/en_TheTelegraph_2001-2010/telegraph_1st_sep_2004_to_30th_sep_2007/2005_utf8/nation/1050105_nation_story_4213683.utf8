 Uplink deadline extended

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: The Union cabinet today gave news channels time till March 31 to bring down their foreign stake to 26 per cent in keeping with the current eligibility criteria for an uplinking facility.

 The three-month extension will provide the government time to review its uplinking policy and mull changes in the guidelines. 

 An official statement issued after a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs said: ?The proposal needs amendments in the existing guidelines. Therefore, it will give time to the information and broadcasting ministry to complete the consultative process with the concerned ministries in respect of a proposal to amend the uplinking guidelines.?

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh chaired the meeting.

 In July 2000, the then Vajpayee government had liberalised the uplinking policy and permitted Indian private companies to set up uplinking hubs for licensing or hiring out to other broadcasters. The eligibility criteria lay down that the company must be incorporated in India. Foreign equity holding, including that of NRIs and overseas corporate bodies, in the uplinking company is capped at 26 per cent.

 The policy permits any television channel to uplink from India. The uplink allows television channels to hook onto foreign satellites and, thereby, widen their footprint. The policy also allows Indian news agencies to have their own uplinking facilities for news gathering and distribution.

 Under the policy, only those TV channels which are specifically approved or permitted by the I amp;B ministry are eligible to uplink from India. All companies need security clearance from the ministry of home affairs as well and the department of space is also consulted. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the licences would result in cancellation of the licences.

 The policy requires a channel to keep a record of materials uplinked for a period of 90 days and to produce them before any agency of the government if required.

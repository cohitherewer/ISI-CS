 Minister in gate pass scrap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 28: State agriculture minister Narendra Singh today allegedly misbehaved with an official who asked him for proof of his identity at the Assembly gates.

 The administrative officer, Deepak Kumar Agrawal, lodged a complaint at the secretariat police station but a police source said: The complaint is being withdrawn, possibly under heavy pressure.

 The minister, who had recently quit the Lok Janshakti Party to join the Janata Dal (United), admitted there was some problem at the gate where he was asked to show his pass.

 Ministers do not carry passes or identification papers, Singh argued.

 The Assembly secretary had placed advertisements in local newspapers today, saying no unauthorised person will be allowed in and asking the new members to carry their election certificate as proof of identity. Singh, however, is not an MLA.

 The minister was angry when asked to prove his identity, said a policeman who witnessed the incident. He and his supporters got off the car and pushed the officer.

 Police said Agrawal had complained about the ministers misbehaviour.

Tremors

 Port Blair, Jan. 10 (PTI): The December 26 quake has crumbled a major portion of Cellular Jail?s wall here.

 About 20 metres of the 15-inch thick stone wall that once skirted the left wing of the jail, built in 1906, now lies in rubble. Cracks have developed in the cells, gallows, exhibition halls and the central tower. 

 Freedom fighters were put in the jail during the British rule. ?This is peak tourist season and any other year we would have had thousands around this time,? said P. Ganesh, an attendant at the near deserted ticket counter. The galleries, which showcase a wealth of information on the freedom movement and priceless nuggets like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose?s first passport photo, taken in 1919, and his last, bear tell-tale signs of the disaster. 

 Cuddalore (PTI): With Black Sunday still fresh in the minds of people in this fishing town, southeast of Tamil Nadu, the survivors are having to bear with ?disaster tourism?. People from across the country, armed with digital cameras, are flocking the area. ?They are coming in big cars, wearing masks and armed with latest cameras to capture the devastation,? said Nirmala Ramanathan, the project officer for the women?s development corporation. ?They click pictures of uprooted trees, fishing nets tangled in bushes and bereaved villagers. Job done, they leave.? 

 Kollam (PTI): Those united in the heavens cannot be parted. The saying came true for Sindhi and Christopher, who tied the knot on Sunday at a church here. Sindhi, 21, had a providential escape when the killer waves swept away her home at Azheekkal. Her father was at Christopher?s house for a confirmation of the marriage when the tsunami struck. Sindhi and her mother escaped from the jaws of death but not their few sovereigns of gold and money saved for the marriage. However, Christopher, 25, was determined to go ahead. On hearing the story, the local archdiocese stepped in with Rs 25,000. Sindhi came for the wedding from a relief camp. 

 Port Blair (PTI): Personal columns in newspapers here are full of a particular brand of advertisements. With photographs, most of them ask: ?Anybody knowing..., please contact....? Many who had gone to work as teachers or engineers to Car Nicobar, Campbell Bay or Katchal islands are missing.

 Torture verdict, 11 years on

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: After more than a decade of humiliation and hurt, Jugta Ram has finally got justice.

 The additional district judge of the Barmer fast-track court, Chandra Sekhar Sharma, yesterday awarded life imprisonment to constable Kishore Singh, 10 years rigorous imprisonment to assistant sub-inspector Sumer Dan and five years rigorous imprisonment to then station house officer Sohan Singh for torturing Ram and severing his private parts.

 The fourth accused, Bheru Singh Bhayal, had passed away during the 11-year-long trial.

 On February 5, 1994, Ram had submitted a written complaint, alleging that Bhayal, in whose shop he used to work, accompanied by three policemen, took him to the barracks and cut off his penis. 

 A bleeding Ram had fainted soon after. When he regained consciousness, he found himself in the Barmer government hospital . 

 A case was registered at Kotwali police station in Barmer. The Rajasthan government then transferred the investigation to the CBI.

 When the probe ended, a chargesheet was filed against the four accused for criminal conspiracy, wrongful confinement, voluntarily causing grievous hurt and attempt to commit culpable homicide. 

 The trial was transferred to the fast-track court, which pronounced its judgment yesterday after the testimony of 41 prosecution witnesses.

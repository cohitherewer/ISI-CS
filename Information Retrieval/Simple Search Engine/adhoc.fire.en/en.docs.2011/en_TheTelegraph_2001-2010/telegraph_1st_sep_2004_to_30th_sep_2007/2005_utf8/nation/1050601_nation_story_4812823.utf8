 Advani plays dove in Pak

 Islamabad, May 31: Talk of pre-emptive strikes and pariah state is passe. L.K. Advani today wore the hat of a peacenik and insisted that it hid no horns.

 As he began his six-day tour of Pakistan, the former deputy Prime Minister was at pains to paint himself as a politician more sinned against than sinning.

 Every person who is in public life and politics has an image. I have been one of those whose image and real persona are not very identical, he told a news conference.

 Not so long ago, Advanis perspective on Pakistan seemed to be defined by three assertions: that India should launch pre-emptive strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir; that Pakistan should be declared a terrorist state and kept out of the global coalition against terrorism; and that the ISI was more dangerous than al Qaida.

 Today, as he met Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and President Pervez Musharraf in the morning and foreign minister Khursheed M. Kasuri in the afternoon, the BJP chief virtually disowned his earlier positions.

 His emphasis was on peace, continuity and a consensus in the Indian political establishment on Indo-Pak relations.

 Alongside the stated intent of showing Islamabad that the Indian establishment was one on Pakistan, Advanis unstated agenda was to prove that of the two domestic issues he was associated with, Ayodhya was history ? with the Babri demolition being an aberration ? and Gujarat an embarrassment. And also, he was not a hawk to be treated on a par with Bal Thackeray and Narendra Modi, as the Pakistani media is apt to do. 

 About the demolition of the masjid, he said: It was the saddest day of my life. Advani has said this before in India.

 What has happened over the past few years to make him embrace peace as his credo, a Pakistani scribe asked him.

 The leader of the Opposition replied: I was just mentioning to the high commissioner that some weeks ago, when Safma (South Asia Free Media Association) had organised a conference in Pakistan, I was asked to delegate my partys MPs. I asked seven of them to participate?. 

 Everyone of them said the meeting was good. But they also said everyone asked when is Advani coming? It seems they (the Pakistanis) eagerly awaited my arrival. May be they wanted to see if I have horns.

 The BJP chief then spelt out his amended line on Indo-Pak relations: I can only say it has been my conviction that it is in the best interests of the people of India and Pakistan if peace and normalcy is established between the countries. 

 However, the other hat he wore ? as leader of a party nurtured on a hate-Pakistan diet ? Advani chose his words with caution and, at one point, even played down a line in a statement prepared by BJP secretary and his political aide, Sudheendra Kulkarni. 

 The statement claimed his meetings signified a new milestone in the peace process. Maybe regarded by some observers as a milestone, my colleague called it so, I felt very happy, he said.

 Advani said the real breakthrough was, in a sense, achieved by Musharraf when he made a commitment, in a joint statement he issued with Vajpayee in January 2004, to not allow terrorists to work out of Pakistani soil. He told the President: It needed a lot of courage to state what was stated in the joint statement.

 Pakistans response was more matter-of-fact. An official statement, broadcast on PTV, said Musharraf, during his meeting with Advani, had appreciated the role that the parliamentarians of India played in creating an enabling environment for bringing normalcy in Indo-Pak relations. It quoted Advani as assuring Musharraf that the BJP was committed to the peace process.

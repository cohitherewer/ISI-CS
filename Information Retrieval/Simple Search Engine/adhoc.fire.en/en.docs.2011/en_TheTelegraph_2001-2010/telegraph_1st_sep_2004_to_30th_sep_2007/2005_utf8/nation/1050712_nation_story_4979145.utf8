 Sonia meets PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 11: Sonia Gandhi today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as Left leaders anxiously awaited the governments response to its demand for a rollback of the proposed Bhel divestment.

 The meeting came a day after Sonias second round of discussions with the Left. 

 The Left parties have sought her intervention to end the UPA-Left deadlock as the Prime Minister is believed to be reluctant to concede to their demand on the ground that the government needs to mobilise resource to fund its social-sector expenditure. 

 The Congress did not reveal much about Sonia and Singhs hour-long meeting. We only can confirm that the two leaders met. But we are clueless about the contents of their discussion, said party spokesman Anand Sharma.

 Congress circles also speculated that the two might have discussed Singhs proposal to reshuffle his ministry.

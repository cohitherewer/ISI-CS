 Scientists frown on varsity tag for labs

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi July 10: Science educators have decried recent moves to turn national laboratories into deemed universities, warning that they would lead to a caste system in Indias science and technology education.

 A critical opinion paper by a university scientist published on Saturday in Current Science, a journal of the Indian Academy of Sciences, has urged a debate on downgrading national laboratories into degree-awarding institutions.

 The government has indicated that some Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) laboratories may soon be declared deemed universities. Earlier this year, the University Grants Commission had granted the status to 10 institutes under the department of atomic energy.

 These initiatives will allow the national laboratories to accept students for doctorate and, in some cases, even masters degrees.

 Universities in India have traditionally held the mandate for higher education. The national laboratories and institutes run by various government departments such as atomic energy, science and technology, or CSIR were intended to meet Indias technology needs.

 However, barring the successes in strategic sectors such as space and atomic energy, technology from laboratories has not grown as expected, says the paper written by Nandula Raghuram, a faculty member at the School of Biotechnology at Indraprastha University in New Delhi.

 Some national laboratories, instead, have become sophisticated versions of universities, drawing better monetary and infrastructure support, Raghuram said, adding that their relative opulence attracts research students who cannot be retained or tapped unless they are promised research degrees.

 The demand to seek university status is an exercise to legitimise the current situation in national laboratories and to redefine their original goals, he said. 

 The country is on the verge of according Brahmanical supremacy to the institutes and condemning universities as untouchables. 

 The national laboratories and institutes have long been better funded than universities. Proponents of moves to throw open these institutes to degree-seeking students say there is a need to attract the countrys best talent to science at top institutions.

 But Raghuram has cautioned that deemed universities may encourage academic inbreeding. 

 Their own students would get preference for employment in such institutes. Opportunities for students from other universities would diminish, he said.

 Leading science educators say some of the new institutes with university status have few faculties. 

 Converting such research-specific institutes to degree-giving institutions is a tragic farce, said Professor Kasturi Lal Chopra, former director of the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.

 Some academics say universities have to share much of the blame for the current trend. 

 Its too late to stop this trend now, said Kambadur Muralidhar, professor of zoology at Delhi University. Any resistance will be seen as a case of sour grapes. 

 In the past, universities should have been more proactive in pursuing research of national significance, attracting and retaining top talent, and tapping private sources for funding, Muralidhar said.

 University academics agree that students prefer to pursue degrees in well-equipped laboratories rather than in funds-starved universities, but they question whether new deemed universities would be able to provide the environment that a true university is expected to deliver.

 A university is supposed to provide the social environment for questioning knowledge and authority. They wont be able to do that in the national laboratories, said Chopra.

 Faculty members at the IIT point out that in the past, the IITs have demonstrated how student talent could be shared across institutions.

 IIT Delhi, for instance, awarded doctorate degrees to researchers at the National Physical Laboratory, while IIT Kharagpur awarded degrees to scientists with the Indian Space Research Organisation and the Defence Research and Development Organisation.

 Krishna strains at leash

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Krishna: Uneasy

 New Delhi, April 6: Maharashtra governor S.M. Krishna is showing signs of the Madan Lal Khurana syndrome.

 Like Khurana ? who quit as Rajasthan governor within a year of occupying the post to return to BJP politics ? the former Karnataka chief minister is thinking of resuming active politics in his home state. 

 Appointed governor of Maharashtra by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government last November, Krishna is believed to be uneasy about his position and has started sending feelers to the Centre and the Congress leadership.

 What has prompted Krishna to feel restless is the possibility that the Centre could shift him from Mumbai to another state capital if the Congress leadership decides to remove Uttaranchal chief minister .D. Tiwari and accommodate him as Maharashtra governor.

 The Chhattisgarh governor?s slot is falling vacant in a few weeks? time. But Krishna, according to party circles, is not willing to go to another state as governor.

 Krishna had reluctantly accepted the Maharashtra governor?s post after the party leadership deferred a contemplated move to remove Tiwari as Uttaranchal chief minister and send him to Mumbai. Now, a section of the leadership has indicated that Tiwari?s removal could again be considered.

 Krishna is also understood to be tempted to return to Karnataka politics as a dominant faction of the Congress loyal to him is feeling the heat from its rivals and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda?s Janata Dal (S), a partner in the Dharam Singh-led coalition government in the state.

 As the Congress organisational elections are round the corner, party circles say the former chief minister is also eyeing the state president?s post. 

 Considerable significance is attached to the party chief?s post as the Congress-JD (S) coalition government has hardly inspired confidence. Many in the Congress see the possibility of mid-term Assembly polls in which the state unit chief would call the shots.

 If Krishna is feeling restless, so is Sushil Kumar Shinde.

 The Andhra Pradesh governor, who had to quit as Maharashtra chief minister after leading the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party coalition back to power last October, is keen on returning to active Congress politics.

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: Focusing almost wholly on job creation on the eve of Republic Day, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today came out with an action-plan for rural employment generation which would help achieve the desired 10 per cent GDP growth rate.

 In the customary address to the nation, Kalam said the objective of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill could be realised only through coordinated planning for productive and sustainable employment generation.

 Basing his estimates on Planning Commission figures, he said that about 76 million people in rural areas needed to be gainfully employed in the next five years. This would help ensure a sustained 10 per cent GDP growth for a decade, which was essential to promote the nation to the rank of developed countries.

 Kalam said the target could be met if specific schemes were evolved and implemented in a planned manner. He suggested seven areas in which jobs could be created: textile industry, bio-fuel generation, wasteland development, water harvesting and recycling, bamboo cultivation, fly ash utilisation, and healthcare and development of village knowledge centres.

 The President said these areas had the potential to create around 56 million jobs in the next five years. This, along with expected job opportunities in the private and government sector of about 20 million, could meet the 76-million target.

 Going into details of his plan, Kalam said the bio-fuel mission ? involving planting of bio-fuel plants on wastelands and processing the fuel ? alone could generate 12 million jobs, apart from saving foreign exchange on oil imports.

 The textile industry could be transformed by taking advantage of the opening of the global textile market, he said. This required a marked improvement in cotton productivity and tripling export of apparel, which would add over five million direct jobs and seven million indirect jobs.

 Focus on rural healthcare would not only improve the prevailing below-average system but also create employment for 1.6 million doctors and paramedics. Against the 1:600 doctor-to-people ratio in developed countries, the ratio in India was 1:1800, he pointed out.

 Water harvesting schemes, renewal of traditional water bodies in rural areas, full utilisation of fly ash and a ?bamboo mission? ? large-scale cultivation of bamboo and exploitation of its commercial potential ? could together generate up to 15 million jobs as they involved labour-intensive processes, Kalam said.

 The President also talked of setting up village knowledge centres using IT that would provide farmers from the village panchayat level access to information. This could provide employment to over a million villagers who would then promote wealth generation in the rural sector, he said.

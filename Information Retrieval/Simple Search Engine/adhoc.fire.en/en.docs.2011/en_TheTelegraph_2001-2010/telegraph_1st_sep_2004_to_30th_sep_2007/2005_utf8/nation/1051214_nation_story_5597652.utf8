 Demolition big bomb ticks on suburb of joy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: Ulhasnagar literally means a suburb of joy. 

 But troubled times today stared this post-Partition colony ? where India settled refugees from Pakistans Sindh province ? in the face after the Supreme Court refused to stay a demolition drive ordered by Bombay High Court.

 The fate of about one lakh people who stay in 855 illegal structures built over 20 years appears to have been sealed. If carried out, the demolition drive could well be the biggest anywhere in India.

 Politicians in Ulhasnagar, 65 km from Mumbai, however, continued to lobby the Vilasrao Deshmukh government to alter the Development Control Rules for the township.

 The demolitions were ordered by Bombay High Court in response to a slew of petitions by residents against illegal constructions in the township.

 When the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation tried to implement the court orders, affected residents backed by parties took to the streets in protest and indulged in violence, forcing the state to halt the demolitions. 

 On December 7, Bombay High Court directed the municipal authorities to resume the demolitions. Some residents then moved the Supreme Court, challenging the high court order on humanitarian grounds.

 However, their hopes were dashed when a bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal declined to entertain their petitions and directed them to approach Bombay High Court. Why should we entertain such petitions? Why did you not approach the high court? the bench asked.

 Bombay High Court has directed the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation to do their job and submit an action taken report on January 10. The case will be heard on January 11.

 After the violence in early December, municipal commissioner Ramnath Sonawane was shunted out. A week later, D.S. Patil, a tribal welfare department officer who has never worked with a municipal corporation, took over. 

 Patil has so far been going slow but is now left with no option. I received a copy of the certified order of Bombay High Court on Monday. We will assess the situation, liaise with police and proceed according to the courts orders, Patil said. 

 He has written to Thane police commissioner D. Sivanandhan to galvanise adequate forces for the demolition, which will be done in phases. Sivanandhan is expected to assess law and order and provide protection to the demolition squads. The demolition is likely to start by the weekend.

 An uneasy calm settled over Ulhasnagar as news of the courts order filtered in. Among those likely to be rendered homeless is Hari Tanwani, who was one of the petitioners who filed the PIL against the illegal constructions. 

 Editor of a local newspaper, Tanwanis Ratan Palace home will be razed in the demolition. Tanwani said his petition was aimed at restoring the rule of law and improving infrastructure in Ulhasnagar, but he had been made the villain of the piece. 

 I am being blamed as the destroyer of Ulhasnagar, Tanwani said.

 Tanwani had sought action against 434 illegal structures erected between January 2000 and March 2003. It could not be confirmed if these structures are included in the demolition order that pinpoints 855 buildings.

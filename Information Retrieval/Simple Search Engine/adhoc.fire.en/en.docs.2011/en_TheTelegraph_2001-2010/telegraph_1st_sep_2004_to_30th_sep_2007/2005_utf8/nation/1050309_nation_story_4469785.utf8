 New Delhi, March 8: International Women?s Day gave Sonia Gandhi a chance to take a break from the rough and tumble of power politics and spend time with some of those who wallow in heat and dust that are far more debilitating.

 The Congress president, a self-proclaimed champion of gender parity, today shook hands with and honoured women who are usually buried in obscurity and seldom feted for their achievements.

 Twenty-five women from the lowest strata of society, who have become entrepreneurs braving adversity, gathered in the expansive auditorium of Vigyan Bhavan to be honoured.

 This was no ladies club. Some of the women are safai karamcharis and all live below the poverty line.

 Handing each a saree and a shawl, Sonia spoke on the need to get more women representatives into Parliament and Assemblies.

 She also lashed out against social attitudes and ?the patriarchal mindset?. ?Attitudes must change,? said Sonia. ?There must be a national initiative to prevent crimes against women. Non-governmental organisations, political parties and the media must take part in it,? she said. 

 On the dais were three powerful women ? Sonia, Delhi?s chief minister Sheila Dikshit and Union social justice minister Meira Kumar.

 The Prime Minister?s wife, Gursharan Kaur, was among the audience in the first row. But Sonia asked her to come to the dais.

 The Congress president once again reminded her own party as well as others that the impasse blocking the passage of the women?s reservation bill must be broken.

 ?The Lok Sabha and state legislatures must have 33 per cent reservation of seats for women. Talks are going on with political parties. I am hopeful of finding a solution,? said Sonia. 

 She also used the occasion to give a gender-friendly image to her government. The government is considering a proposal to bring new laws against all forms of atrocities on women, Sonia added. 

 ?The pattas given to landless families must be in the name of women,? she added.

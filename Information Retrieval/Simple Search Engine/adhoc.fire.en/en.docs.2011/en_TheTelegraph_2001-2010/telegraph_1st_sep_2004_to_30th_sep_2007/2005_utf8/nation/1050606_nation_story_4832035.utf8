 Yangon looks around to fend off US plot

 KAY BENEDICT

 Yangon, June 5: An equation on a board in the office of Thet Win Tu, the first secretary in the embassy of Myanmar in Delhi, reads: 1 Indian = brain, 10 Indians = chaos; 1 Japanese = zero, 10 Japanese = 1 Toyota.

 The intended pun on the unruly nature of Indians notwithstanding, there is a marked improvement in the ties between Delhi and the junta in Yangon. This is largely because of Indias continued silence over the house arrest of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi despite Left parties asking the United Progressive Alliance government to press for the pro-democracy leaders release.

 Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in 1990, has been in and out of jail since 1989. She has been under house arrest since May 31, 2003.

 In Yangon, nobody talks about Suu Kyi or about human rights. However, the junta is worried about the Americans and feels there is a sinister US plan to help separatists in the northern Shan province.

 Government officials feel the US is plotting to intervene as it did in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yangon is, therefore, warming up to major regional players like India.

 The junta is a fairly merciless dictatorship. But not as dark and foreboding as projected by the western media, said an Indian official here. 

 Myanmar is helping India cement its ties with the Association of South East Asian Nations and backing the country in its bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council. India is also aware of Myanmars geostrategic position.

 India and China are working on a plan to reopen the strategic Stilwell Road through Myanmar, which would reduce the distance between the two countries from 6,000 km to 1,300 km and turn Southeast Asia into a major trading hub.

 Delhi cites the 1,400-km common border with Myanmar, the only Asean country to share a border with India, as one of the imperatives for improving ties. Officials say the pillar of Indias Look East policy is better ties with Myanmar and also point to the security scene in the Northeast.

 The Indian ambassador in Yangon, Rajeev K. Bhatia, described Myanmar as a complex country passing through transition from tradition to modernity, from a military form of government to democracy according to their own programmes and policies.

 There is much in Myanmar to remind one of India. The Indian diaspora, estimated to be about 10 lakh, is well entrenched. A majority of them are Tamils. There are also many Bengalis, Biharis and people from Andhra Pradesh. An uninformed visitor could mistake the round-shaped Myanmarese script as that of Telugu with a good Sanskrit coating. Neat and well laid out, Yangon has the quaint look of a south Indian town.

 The Indian connections include Subhas Chandra Bose, whose Indian National Army fought near Yangon, the mausoleum of the last Mughal emperor, and the father-in-law of petroleum minister Mani Shakar Aiyar, who died fighting for the British against Netajis forces and is buried in the war cemetery in the city.

 Part of Shyam Benegals Bose, The Forgotten Hero was shot in the city last year. 

 Aware that the China factor is inhibiting Yangons relations with Delhi, President Than Shwe is now crafting a Look Around policy in consonance with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs Look East policy. 

 All neighbours are friends. Though we are more friendly with China, there is a growing realisation that cooperation with India is good for both the countries, said a government official.

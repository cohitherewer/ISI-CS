 TV content monitor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: Information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy has once again assured Parliament that a regulator for monitoring content on television channels will soon be in place.

 The ministry is working on a comprehensive legislation, which will be tabled in Parliament during the monsoon session. Reddy said the government has in mind an autonomous authority to regulate content and details were being worked out.

 Members were not just worried about the violence and sex being promoted on television, but were equally concerned about sting operations carried out by some channels to target politicians.

 Congress member V. Narayanaswamy wanted the draft bill to ensure that the privacy of politicians was respected. However, Reddy said political leaders could get no special privileges in the bill. 

 The right to privacy of every citizen and not just of political leaders had to be respected, he added.

 Narayanaswamy had said that many television channels were out to malign politicians in their eagerness to get better ratings than their rivals. ?Now the worry is, the private channels, in their media war and competition, are trying to malign politicians, bureaucrats and people in public life. There is no remedy available to these people, except to go to court, which takes several years,? Narayanaswamy said.

 ?For 36 years, I have been a parliamentarian in my own right or (been) in the state legislature. I dont think politicians have any special rights (to protect them) from any kind of defamation,? Reddy told the Congress member.

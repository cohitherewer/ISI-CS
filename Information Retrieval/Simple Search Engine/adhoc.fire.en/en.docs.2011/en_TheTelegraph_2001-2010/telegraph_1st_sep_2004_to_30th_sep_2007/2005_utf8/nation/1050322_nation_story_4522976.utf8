 Doubts over tiger tally

 Bhubaneswar, March 21: The tiger seems to be under threat in the most famous forest of Orissa.

 Although the population of the majestic animal in Similipal Tiger Reserve in Mayurbhanj district has remained ?stable? in the past decade, conservationists and animal lovers have raised doubts over the figures released by the state wildlife department. According to last year?s census, the 3,000-sq km reserve had a tigers population of 94. 

 In the past 15 years, the numbers have hardly increased with the population hovering between 93 and 99. It now turns out that even Orissa is not the big success story it?s made out to be.

 Though wildlife and tiger reserve officials insist that there is no cause for concern, the signs are worrying, feel conservationists. 

 ?We are not saying that there are no tigers in the reserve. But the numbers are surely less than what the records suggest,? says wildlife activist Biswajit Mohanty. He adds that the pugmark method of counting adopted by the tiger reserve officials is ?highly erroneous?. 

 ?Instead of the pugmark method, we can go for camera-trapping, which is more accurate and differentiates two tigers from their pattern of stripes,? he Mohanty says.

 Wildlife activist Bibhas Pandav concurs. Pandav, who successfully followed the camera-trapping method in Bandipur reserve of Karnataka a couple of years ago, says the statistics can be more accurate if the pugmark method is dumped.

 The wildlife authorities feel that the situation is under control. ?It?s really commendable that we have managed to maintain the population for decades. Besides, the numbers have also reached a saturation point,? says chief wildlife warden Suresh Mohanty. 

 He, however admits that lack of space caused by human encroachment is a worrying factor. 

 In the tiger reserve, the buffer zone is spread over an area of 2,200 sq km while the core area is over 845 sq km. Mohanty says there have been fewer tiger sightings as most of them are found in the core area, where human movement is minimal. 

 However, wildlife enthusiast Ranjit Patnaik says the increasing density of tigers in the core area is a matter of concern. ?Once they start getting squeezed in a small area, the tigers can die instantly in the event of an epidemic. Besides, poaching is also easy,? he argued.

 In Similipal, the number of encroachers has gone up from 6,000 in the Seventies to 12,000, contributing to the woes of the tiger, feels a source.

 Aman on sting alert

 Aman Verma

 Mumbai, March 16: Aman Verma, one of the most popular television anchors, tonight filed a complaint against India TV, accusing the channel of trying to induce a sting operation and malign his image.

 Verma met Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy at 9 pm and handed over a written complaint against the channel, which had conducted a sting operation on Bollywood villain Shakti Kapoor last week.

 Verma?s lawyer Deepesh Mehta told The Telegraph the actor-turned-anchor mentioned in the complaint an India TV reporter and the same team which shot Kapoor with a hidden camera had approached him on December 17, 2004, at his house.

 ?For three months, Verma suffered great mental trauma. But, after seeing what happened to Kapoor, he felt he should lodge a complaint against the channel for trying to misrepresent him and destroy his career,? Mehta said.

 Verma has anchored several TV programmes, including Khul Ja Sim Sim and Indian Idol.

 Mehta said the India TV reporter repeatedly telephoned Verma for over a fortnight requesting for a meeting. Verma eventually agreed to meet the girl at his house.

 He suspects that his meeting that day at 4.30 pm has been secretly filmed and could be broadcast by the channel soon, Mehta said.

 ?The police can take legal action against the channel for any of the offences including cheating, criminal breach of trust, fraud, misrepresentation and impersonation. The sting operation was conducted in an identical manner as the one against Kapoor,? Mehta said.

 India TV had earlier hinted Kapoor was not the only personality they had targeted to expose what it claimed was ?sexual exploitation of innocent women? in the Indian entertainment industry.

 It had said that a popular TV anchor and veteran film star were also secretly taped by the channel?s ?investigative? teams.

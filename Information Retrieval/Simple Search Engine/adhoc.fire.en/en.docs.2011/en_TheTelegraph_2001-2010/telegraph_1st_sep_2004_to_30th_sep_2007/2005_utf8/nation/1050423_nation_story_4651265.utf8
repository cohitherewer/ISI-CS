 ?Arjun? Uma alone in battle

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Uma: On her own

 Bhopal, April 22: Uma Bharti may be taking on Arjun?s role to fight the BJP, but no one is willing to play Krishna.

 The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, who had yesterday slammed the BJP top rung likening the power struggle in the party to the Mahabharat, found herself standing alone on the battlefield, with even her die-hard loyalists distancing themselves.

 Dozens of supporters, fearing retribution in the state, have begun to desert Uma, who projected herself as the principal dissident.

 None of the state ministers, BJP functionaries, heads of public sector undertakings and government-run corporations who used to profess loyalty to her has publicly endorsed Uma?s utterances at her Amarkantak meeting yesterday.

 BJP leader Nitish Bhardwaj, who played Krishna in the televised version of the Mahabharat, said he was with his party. ?Whatever she has said is between her and the BJP leadership and I have no role in it.? 

 The actor-turned-politician heads the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation and is perceived to be close to Uma.

 Chief minister Babulal Gaur, who underwent a cataract operation yesterday, has signalled a ?carrot and stick? policy ? a cabinet reshuffle is on the cards in the first week of May where loyalty will be at premium. Uma?s supporters have been given a choice to keep the sadhvi at arm?s length or face action. 

 Seven ministers in the Gaur government are considered to be Uma loyalists ? Gauri Shankar Shejwar, Dhaal Singh Bisen, Archana Chitnis, Om Prakash Dhruv, Dileep Bhatare, Harnam Singh Rathore and Anoop Mishra. 

 However, none of them has shown any signs of that support lingering. Apart from Bisen, no one participated in the yagna and community meal that the former chief minister had organised in Amarkantak yesterday.

 Sources close to Gaur said Mishra is unlikely to face the heat as he is the nephew of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Chitnis and Bhatare have promised the chief minister that they would stand by him.

 The state BJP has made it clear that indiscipline will not be tolerated. Kaptan Singh Solanki, the organisation secretary of the state unit, today said action would be taken against those who raised anti-Gaur slogans in Amarkantak.

 A transcript and video recording of Uma?s speech has been sent to Delhi for ?necessary action?.

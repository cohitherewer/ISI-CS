 Villagers drink flood water

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 27: As rescuers struggled to reach them across a sea of water swirling over destroyed roads, villagers in Cuddalore have reportedly begun drinking flood water to stave off dehydration.

 Some 2,000 students marooned for days on the Annamalai University campus were luckier: the armys mechanised boats rescued them from their flooded hostels today.

 Asked about villagers drinking flood water and the threat of epidemic this posed, Cuddalore district collector Gagandeep Singh Bedi said: Initially, that was the situation. But today, with the waters beginning to recede significantly, we have been able to reach most of the affected villages and drop food packets and water pouches.

 With the army and the Coast Guard having given relief and rescue operations a fillip, the district administration has been dropping chlorinated tablets along with the food packets ? mainly bread and biscuits. 

 Teams of doctors and paramedical staff have fanned out across the accessible parts of the district to try and control the outbreak of disease, Bedi said.

 A letter from chief minister Jayalalithaa to the Prime Minister has painted a grim picture of the devastation across the states southern districts: over 20,000 km of roads damaged or destroyed, bridges and culverts washed away, more than 3,000 irrigation tanks and 1,500 river embankments breached, and crops ruined across at least 3.50 lakh hectares.

 Jayalalithaa has urged the Prime Minister to immediately release Rs 3,000 crore from the National Calamity Contingency Fund.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil, finance minister P. Chidambaram and minister of state for home S. Raghupathy today surveyed some of the flood-hit areas. Patil termed the floods a national calamity.

 Chidambaram and MDMK leader Vaiko had earlier visited the government hospital in Tiruvadanai, where many of those injured in the Ramanathapuram bus tragedy have been admitted.

 Over five lakh people have been evacuated from low-lying areas across southern Tamil Nadu.

 Bedi said 383 villages in Cuddalore were ravaged by the floods. The huge Veeranam lake in the district was still overflowing, contributing to the damage.

 Two defence helicopters have been pressed into service, but we need at least two more, the collector said.

 The town of Chidambaram, which has the famous Natarajan temple, is almost totally under water except for a small area near the shrine. The Annamalai University on the towns outskirts is flooded with the water level rising up to the first floor of the students hostels. The university has declared a weeks holiday.

 The army has pressed eight mechanised boats into service in the district and some 70 personnel are ferrying food between Cuddalore town and Chidambaram.

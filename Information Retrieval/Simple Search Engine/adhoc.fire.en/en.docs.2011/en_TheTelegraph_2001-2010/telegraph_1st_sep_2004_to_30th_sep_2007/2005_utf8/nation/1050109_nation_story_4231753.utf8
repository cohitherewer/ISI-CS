 Cloud on dual citizenship offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s announcement yesterday that dual citizenship would be offered to any Indian who left the country after January 26, 1950, appears to be a smarter version of the BJP-led coalition?s People of Indian Origin card. But it falls well short of what many countries in the West ? and some closer home like Pakistan ? offer under similar schemes.

 On the face of it, Singh?s offer covers any Indian who left the country after the specified date, provided the country of their residence allows dual citizenship. Under the earlier government, NRIs settled only in 16 countries ? all of which are in the developed West ? were given this facility. But the new proposal has not clarified whether additional rights and advantages will be given to Indians who are foreign citizens.

 According to existing rules, dual citizenship allows an Indian who is a citizen of another country to live in India indefinitely, not up to the specified six-month period that the PIO card had originally proposed.

 The law also permits Indians, who are citizens of other countries, to not only invest but also to buy property in India. But they cannot vote in Indian elections or be elected to any public office in the country.

 This falls well short of what dual citizenship means to people of other countries. For instance, a Pakistani, who is a citizen of another country, enjoys all the rights his countrymen in Pakistan enjoy. He can vote, buy or sell property and invest in companies.

 Some analysts believe that the concept of dual citizenship is still a mirage. They point to a section on overseas citizenship on the website of the Indian high commission in London which says: ?The Constitution of India does not permit dual citizenship or dual nationality, unless amended.?

 It goes on to make clear that there is also no provision in the Indian Passport Act for an Indian citizen to possess a foreign passport while retaining his Indian passport, unless the law is amended. 

 ?Overseas citizenship is not a full citizenship of India and, therefore, does not amount to dual citizenship or dual nationality.?

 Officials in Delhi say the website is dot on the mark.

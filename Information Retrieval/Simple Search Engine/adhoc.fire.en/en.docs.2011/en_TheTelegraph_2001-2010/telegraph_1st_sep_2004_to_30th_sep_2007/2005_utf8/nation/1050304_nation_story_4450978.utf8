 Stock pile-up on fresh fear

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, March 3: The government, anticipating reimposition of the Maoists? nationwide blockade, launched a major exercise to stockpile essential commodities in the Kathmandu valley even as security forces arrested students for demonstrating against the February 1 royal coup.

 The authorities today asked several prominent traders who import essential commodities from India to stock up enough in their warehouses. Some were told that the government would provide storage facilities, including godowns, if needed.

 State-owned Nepal Oil Corporation, the sole importer of petroleum products from India, has been asked to shift enough stock from its depot near Birgunj on the India-Nepal border. ?We want to ensure that Kathmandu is not starved of any supplies. We plan to stock up supplies to last at least two months,? a security source said.

 State-run newspapers quoted commerce ministry and Nepal Food Corporation officials as saying that truckloads of additional supplies had begun arriving in the valley since yesterday. They also claimed that the government was increasing storage capacity by requisitioning private warehouses and creating new ones.

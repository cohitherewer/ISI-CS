 MRP warning to errant traders

 New Delhi, Nov. 27 (PTI): A state consumer court has said traders would be liable to face heavy punitive damages if they sold goods over the maximum retail price.

 The word MRP printed on packaged goods means that no hotel, restaurant, PVR, club or cinema has any right to charge more than what is printed thereon, the Delhi state consumer disputes redressal commission said.

 Rejecting an appeal filed by the fast-food chain Nirulas, commission president J.D. Kapoor said: If any complaint of this nature is received in future, the culprit shall be visited with such heavy punitive damages running into lakhs which may drive them out from selling such articles or goods.

 Ankit Jain, a third-year law student at Delhi University, had approached the district consumer forum after the Nirulas outlet in Mayur Vihar charged him Rs 35 for a Rs 15 Coke bottle. 

 The court said: No kind of explanation, including the one that sale of such articles is not the core activity but is incidental to the overall services rendered, is permissible or acceptable.

 Even an illiterate and gullible person knows the meaning of the word MRP, the court said, adding that it was the statutory obligation on the part of traders to sell goods within their retail price. It said sale of a particular quantity of an article by opening the package or by any other process at a higher rate than the MRP amounts to deficiency of service.

 Gujarat riot butchers get life

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 14: A fast-track court today awarded life terms to an armed gang of 11 which butchered nearly a dozen minority community members and threw three of them into a well during the post-Godhra riots.

 The 11, part of a 29-member mob carrying sharp weapons, swooped on a group taking shelter in a school compound in Ajwana village in Panchmahal, one of the districts worst hit in the 2002 Gujarat carnage.

 They burnt a woman, Rukaiah, and dumped her in a well near the school, then pushed two children into the same well before setting two elderly people on fire.

 This is the first sentence awarded in such a gruesome case of mass murder during the riots. It was awarded by the fast-track court of R.D. Thakkar in Godhra.

 Eighteen people were acquitted for want of evidence in the case in which over 80 witnesses were questioned.

 Advocate Siraj Malik, who represented the victims, said Rukaiah was the wife of the main complainant in the case, Gafurbhai Rasoolbhai Sheikh.

 The gang of 11 sentenced today included prime accused Dalpa Jethabhai Baria, Kalu Soma, Bana Phata, Raisinh Phula, Dhana Rupa, Salam Aba, Balwant Jiva, Natwar Kalu and Ratna Kalu.

 The court also awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment to three of the 34 people accused in a kidnap and murder case in the same village.

 The same mob is believed to have indulged in arson and looted the properties of the minority community. About 40 houses and shops were razed and a mosque desecrated.

 One Kalu Gulam, who ran a shop in the nearby Vena village, was kidnapped and killed.

 The court also imposed a fine of Rs 250 each or an additional 15 days imprisonment on the three ? Dhana Rupa (who also got life sentence in the first case), Raisinh Puja and Bharat Puja. Thirty-one people were acquitted for want of evidence.

 The body of Kalu Gulam has not been recovered. Although he was listed as missing in the FIR, the court had later registered a case of murder.

 The sentence came a day after the Union government extended the tenure of the Justice U.C. Banerjee committee probing the 2002 Sabarmati Express fire at Godhra station. 

 The committee has been given three more months beyond the December 4, 2005 deadline, an official statement said on Tuesday. This is the fifth extension given to the panel.

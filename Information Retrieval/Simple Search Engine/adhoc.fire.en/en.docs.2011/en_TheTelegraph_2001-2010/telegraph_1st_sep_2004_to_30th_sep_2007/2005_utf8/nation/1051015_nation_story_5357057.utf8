 Private aid for Pak via Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: As part of its relief efforts, India has now allowed private organisations and international aid agencies to send material to Pakistan.

 After sending two consignments to Pakistan ? one of which reached the Wagah-Atari border tonight ? India is planning to send yet another one with medicines and food to Lahore very soon.

 The foreign ministry said a consignment of 68 tonnes of relief material would reach the border tonight and be taken to Lahore tomorrow morning.

 The material, sent in four wagons of the Samjhauta Express, includes 5,000 blankets, 320 tents and four-and-a-half tonnes of plastic sheets. The first supplies of relief had reached Islamabad on October 10 in an IL-76 transport aircraft.

 South Block officials said though private organisations and international aid agencies based in India are being allowed to send relief to Pakistan, it has to be routed through the government.

 The reason is that several items that are likely to be sent as aid may fall under the negative list ? items that cannot be imported from India. We need to intervene and work it with our Pakistani counterparts to ensure that the material being sent by these organisations is not stopped at the border, a senior foreign ministry official said.

 Indian officials said that though Islamabad had made a request to use Indian territory to reach inaccessible areas in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, it was now trying to play down the issue.

 Pakistani officials are now asking India to allow the countrys choppers and aircraft to fly very close to the Line of Control ? something that is not allowed by either side under normal circumstances. It is not clear whether Delhi will overlook it if Pakistani aircraft or helicopters intrude into the Indian airspace.

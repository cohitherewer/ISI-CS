 Dubai workers taste blood

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dubai, Sept. 21: The Indian government has blacklisted a contracting company in Dubai after it repeatedly violated contractual obligations to workers.

 Blacklisting means a ban on recruitment of Indian workers and refusal to grant consular service, including attestation of documents related to workers. 

 The firm involved is Al Hamed Company for Development, which employs about 15,000 people of various nationalities.

 It was hit by a flash strike on Monday staged by nearly 1,000 Asian workers ? most of them Indians ? demanding backpay of up to five months.

 The company has worked out a compromise under which it will pay three months outstanding wages by the end of this month and the rest by next month.

 The development is seen as a victory for workers and a sign that more labour unrest could follow in similar situations in other companies. 

 On the positive side, employers would be careful not to violate the ministry regulations on timely payment of wages and other contractual obligations.

 Sources said the company had appealed to the ministry of labour against enforcing a 24-hour deadline set on Monday for settling the dues and worked out the compromise with the ministrys intervention.

 The company, which would have had to cough up more than 5 million dirhams if it were to meet the deadline set by the minister of labour, Ali Bin Abdullah Kaabi, submitted that it was not possible for it to do so.

 A committee of labour, police, immigration and municipal officials will monitor the implementation of the payment agreement.

 New Delhi, April 29: A solution to the Bihar deadlock appears in sight with the Lok Janshakti Party for the first time agreeing to do business with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 Lok Sabha MP Ramachandra Paswan, brother of LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, today said the party could join hands with the RJD to break the logjam.

 Sources said United Progressive Alliance strategists had almost managed to push through the name of Congress leader Meira Kumar, the Union minister for social justice and empowerment, for the post of chief minister as a stopgap arrangement that involves holding fresh elections after a year.

 Meira, daughter of the late Jagjivan Ram, is no threat to either Paswan or RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav as she is considered a lightweight without political ambition. As chief minister, she will be critically dependent on the LJP and the RJD.

 Meira will not be able to dent Paswan?s base as she belongs to the chamar caste. She could also be used as a foil to Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayavati who is making forays into Bihar.

 Ramachandra said if there could be a UPA government at the Centre, there could be another in Bihar as well. ?There is a UPA government at the Centre. In Bihar also, a UPA government can be formed provided a Muslim is made the chief minister,? he said.

 The chief minister could be from any UPA party, he said when reminded the LJP did not have a Muslim MLA.

 This is the first time the LJP is talking of doing business with the RJD and even expressing willingness to accept an RJD chief minister if the candidate is a Muslim.

 However, LJP sources said Ram Vilas Paswan, who was rooting for a Muslim chief minister, is not averse to Meira?s candidature.

 The LJP chief had first floated the name of Union minister Shakeel Ahmed of the Congress for the chief minister?s post. He then talked about Nationalist Congress Party leader Tariq Anwar, as a consensus candidate, but there were no takers.

 The name of RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, the Union minister for rural development, too, was floated. However, Laloo Prasad vetoed this. 

 Congress leader Sadananad Singh, the Speaker of the erstwhile Assembly, was also considered for the post, but there was no unanimity on his name.

 The LJP may not be averse to making RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui the chief minister as it would earn goodwill among the Muslims. But sources said Laloo Prasad may not oblige. 

 This has prompted efforts on a consensus on Meira.

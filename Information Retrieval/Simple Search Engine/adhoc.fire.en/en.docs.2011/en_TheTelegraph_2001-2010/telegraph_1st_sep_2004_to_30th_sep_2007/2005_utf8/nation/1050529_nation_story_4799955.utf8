 Naxalites kill three 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 28: Three persons were shot dead when suspected CPI (Maoist) rebels fired at villagers in Sambalpur district yesterday. 

 About half a dozen Naxalites, sporting black glasses and caps, stormed into Buruda village at 10.30 pm and asked residents the whereabouts of their sarpanch, Jayram Bhoi. 

 When the villagers feigned ignorance and tried to resist the militants, they fired indiscriminately, said Sambalpur range DIG Pranabindu Acharya. 

 Four villagers were injured in the attack.

 The Naxalites fled to the nearby jungles.

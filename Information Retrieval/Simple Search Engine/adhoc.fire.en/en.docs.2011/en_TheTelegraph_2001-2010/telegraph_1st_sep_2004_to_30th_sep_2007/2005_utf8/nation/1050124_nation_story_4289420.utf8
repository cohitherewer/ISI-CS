 Laloo under Jaitley fire

 Patna, Jan. 23 (PTI): The BJP today flayed railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav for his decision to accord the status of a full-fledged commission to the U.C. Banerjee committee arguing that law and order is a state subject.

 ?Engaging a commission or a committee to probe a crime amounts to unnecessary interference in the judiciary and against the constitutional rights of a state,? BJP general secretary and in-charge of Bihar Arun Jaitley said at a news conference here.

 ?It is not the duty of the railway ministry to investigate a crime. Law and order is a state subject and no commission or committee will be legally and constitutionally valid to investigate such a case,? he added.

 Laloo Prasad had promised to accord the status of a full-fledged commission to the U.C. Banerjee committee, arming it with necessary legal teeth to summon and issue non-bailable arrest warrants against all those who fail to comply with its summons.

 Jaitley alleged that even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has ?sided with the railway minister giving a go-ahead to the constitution of the committee headed by Justice U.C. Banerjee?.

 Dubbing the interim report of the committee on the Godhra train burning ?a disgraceful document,? he claimed that Gujarat police had stumbled upon vital documents that highlighted a well-planned conspiracy hatched at a guest house and the purchase and transportation of petrol to Godhra railway station. 

 ?It is the judiciary and not a committee with political bias, which will decide who is guilty and who is innocent. The interim report is aimed at helping and shielding the culprits,? he added.

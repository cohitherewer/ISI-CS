 Films cross Great Wall

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Young men in the audience tap their feet as Rajesh Khanna sings to a coy Asha Parekh. The 70s hit, Kati Patang, has made a strong comeback in 2005.

 Only, the theatres are all Chinese ? in Beijing and even the rural areas. Pakistan, with a shared language, culture and history, may be shutting its doors to Bollywood, but the Chinese have begun opening their hearts.

 The Centre, however, woke up to the potential of this untapped market only after learning that pirated film DVDs and CDs were regularly being smuggled into China.

 The demand, it seems, far outstrips the supply and Chinese movie buffs have to be content with watching blockbusters from the 60s and 70s. Officials say Kati Patang is currently one of the biggest hits in China.

 Yet very few Indian films are commercially released in China, because Beijing has a strict import policy, allowing only 40 foreign films to release commercially in a year. Most are from Hollywood. The only Indian film commercially released in China in recent months is Lagaan. But it wasnt strictly a Bollywood venture because the distribution was done by Sony pictures.

 But the information and broadcasting ministry has started getting its act together. It hosted the Chinese minister for the state agency for radio, film and TV last year.

 We took him to Mumbai. He met Amitabh Bachchan and people like Yash Chopra and Shakti Samanta, an official said. We also took him around the sets and he saw some shoots. The idea was to sensitise the Chinese authorities to Bollywood.

 India has also found a way around Chinas film import rules: Delhi is set to sign a co-production agreement with Beijing. As the films will be produced by both Indian and Chinese film-makers, the final product will be eligible for distribution in China, a ministry source said.

 Delhi is also forming an Indo-China Film Commission. The Indian side will be represented by the I amp;B secretary and several industry bigwigs, such as producer Yash Chopra, Ajay Bijli of PVR multiplex fame and Romesh Sharma, whose New Delhi Times was critically acclaimed. The first meeting is scheduled for March.

 The ministry also plans a festival of Indian films in China. The list hasnt been finalised yet, an official said.

 Talks sincere, says Muivah

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Bangkok, Oct. 10: Oscar Fernandes, the main Indian political negotiator for the Naga peace talks, has described as positive the proposal of Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), for forging a close relationship with India in a step-by-step manner.

 After the first round of peace talks today, Muivah said that the hurt feelings of the Nagas, upset about the tardy progress of the peace process and repeated ceasefire violations, had been assuaged a little bit with two overtures from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 Fernandes, who met the Prime Minister before leaving for Bangkok, told Muivah that Singh was also upset with reports of an alleged encounter killing of NSCN cadre in Shillong last week and had asked him to ascertain the facts personally. 

 Although he had primarily gone to look into an incident of the police firing on students in Meghalaya, Fernandes told Muivah that he had stopped in Shillong to get a first-hand account of the encounter that has angered the Nagas no end.

 But more importantly, Fernandes told him that Singh had categorically stated that his government recognised the unique history of the Nagas and wanted to seek a peaceful and honourable solution on that basis. 

 An obviously pleased Muivah said: This is the first time that a Congress-led government has said this. Till now they had kept mum on this subject. So this is a positive sign.

 He described todays talks as cordial and sincere and added, As long as there is determination to go forward we can hope to make progress. 

 He felt that the proposal for a close federation with India, addressing Indias security concerns and a two-step process for the integration of Naga areas cannot be objected to by the Government of India.

 The scene was set for friendly delegation-level talks by Fernandes this morning when he had an informal one-to-one meeting with Muivah. Later, the duo was joined by K. Padmanabhaiah, special representative for the Naga talks. 

 It was at this meeting that Fernandes conveyed to Muivah Singhs approach to the Naga peace process.

 This prevented the fireworks that were expected at the delegation-level talks about ceasefire violations. 

 The NSCN (I-M) delegation presented a list of incidents of ceasefire violations; the Shillong incident was also discussed, with the Nagas providing pictorial evidence to support their allegation of torture and custodial killing.

 However, the atmosphere remained friendly.

 Muivah apparently told the Indian delegation that it had become very difficult to heal the wounds of the Nagas caused by the brutal behaviour of the Indian security forces and that this limited my freedom to negotiate a peaceful settlement. The Indian side seems to have appreciated his difficulty.

 About the Naga resentment at ceasefire violation, Fernandes admitted that the NSCN (I-M) had raised some very serious concerns. He said: They have brought to our notice certain instances of ceasefire violations and we will go into them in detail. The pictures they have provided us about the Shillong incident in particular can only help us in ascertaining the facts.

 Fernandes seemed to agree that ceasefire violations occurred because of poor co-ordination between a multiplicity of state and central agencies and security forces. However, he said: India is a vast country and there are different agencies there. We do our best to co-ordinate their activities.

 Muivah, however, was not stingy in giving credit to the Indian negotiators for understanding the NSCN (I-M)s concerns. 

 We believe that they have understood the seriousness of the situation both politically and militarily. We also believe that this would result in their being more serious in dealing with future issues and situations. They know that without this the political talks cannot proceed, he said.

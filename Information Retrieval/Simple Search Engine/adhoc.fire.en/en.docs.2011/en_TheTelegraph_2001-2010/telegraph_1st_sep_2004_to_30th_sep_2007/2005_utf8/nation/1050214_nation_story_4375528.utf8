 Tsunami victims keep faith in stars

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Kanyakumari, Feb. 13: Next to God is Vivek Oberoi. And possibly, Tamil stars Sarath Kumar and Vijay.

 One adopted a whole village ? Devampattinam in Cuddalore district ? days after the tsunami stunned the daylights out of millions in Tamil Nadu. The others, taking a tip from the Bollywood star, arranged visas for fishermen who had lost everything so that they could go to Gulf countries and take up contract jobs there.

 Little wonder then that more than the government or the numerous NGOs who rushed in to dole out relief, they are the ones who have touched the hearts of survivors in this worst-devastated Chinna Muttom fishing hamlet.

 One survivor, Tamizharasi Edison, made no bones about who she trusted more. Militant-looking and draped in a deep red sari, her voice trembled with emotion as she tentatively put forward a query.

 ?Can you give us the address of a Tamil film star in Chennai whom we can contact?? she asked, standing outside the makeshift shelter the government has put her up in.

 Before this correspondent could gather his wits at the unexpectedness of her question, her little son raced out with a notebook in hand to jot down the star?s address.

 By that time, Tamizharasi had withdrawn into her shell. But her neighbour Edison, a fisherman, spoke up for her. Vivek?s gesture had inspired Tamil stars to pay ?conscience visits? to tsunami-struck villages, he said.

 ?Recently, Tamil actors Sarath Kumar (who is also a DMK MP) and Vijay did something different. Vijay managed to get visas for 25 fishermen and Sarath Kumar helped to get another 30 visas to those most badly hit,? he said.

 The beneficiaries were not fishermen of their village but of Melamanakudi, but that didn?t detract from the magnanimity of their gesture, Edison added.

 ?Since we are not sure when government assistance will reach us so that we can repair our boats and put out to sea again, going abroad makes sense.

 ?So, fishermen from our village also want to write to another prominent film star in Chennai who can help us get visas to go and work abroad for some time,? he said, filling in the gaps in Tamizharasi?s story.

 Another fisherwoman, Selvi, butted in angrily. ?How long we can live on the 60 kg of rice and a little cash the Tamil Nadu government has given us??

 Edison said the fishermen kept idle most of the time, though the priest from the local church dropped in occasionally ?to give a pep talk to our children?.

 In some relief camps, people just sat in small circles and played cards endlessly, he said. Others heatedly discussed the latest sarkari announcement that was making little difference to them. 

 All in all, the mood was of depression in spite of the efforts of the government and the NGOs, he said.

London, Jan. 15: A Muslim bus cleaner, Mohammed Sajwal Khan, who was sacked for going on a six-week trip to Mecca has won ?10,000 as a victim of religious discrimination in what employment experts are calling a landmark case.

 In theory, this may mean that British employers will have to be more indulgent in future with Indian workers who want to take long leave for Puja, Diwali, Id, Baisakhi and other festivals.

 In practice, this is unlikely to happen since the Indian success story in Britain, certainly at the shopkeeper level, is based on working excessively long hours and cashing in on the English tendency towards a relaxed life style during weekends and holidays. Even journalists find that press officers often refuse to answer questions if called at home or on their off-days.

 On Christmas Day and Boxing Day, if there are any shops open they are more than likely to be Indian.

 The news agents trade is now dominated by Indians because they are the only ones prepared to wake up at 5 am, to sort out newspaper bundles. The sight of middle-aged Gujarati couples, swathed in woollens, stacking copies of tabloids not particularly sympathetic to Asians, is now part of the British economic landscape. Such folk seldom take holidays, least of all, long holidays.

 Nevertheless, the case of Khan, 43, whose job was to clean buses, is likely to be treated as a legal precedent. His lawyers have won a claim for unfair discrimination and discrimination contrary to the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003.

 Khan had worked for NIC Hygiene Ltd since 1996 but was dismissed from his ?8,000 a year job in March 2004.

 He decided to use his holiday entitlement to go to Mecca on Haj and he was entitled to 25 days? leave. He also wanted to add on a little unpaid leave. He appears to have behaved correctly in every way.

 At first he did not receive a response from his bosses about his proposed trip and his union advised him to put in a written request. Again, he did not get a response and his manager said if he heard nothing, he could assume it was all right to go.

 Khan left the country to go to Mecca at the beginning of January, 2004. He returned to England in February and returned to work, only to be told by his line manager that he was being suspended without pay whilst an investigation was conducted into his unauthorised absence. He was later sacked for gross misconduct.

 Khan, from Bradford, said: ?I was so excited at having the opportunity of going on a Haj. I had a wonderful experience and when I returned to England I was so pleased I had made a pilgrimage. I was not expecting to be dismissed.?

 It is unclear whether the firm wanted to be nasty to Khan because he was Muslim and wanted to lead him into a trap so that he could be dismissed with impunity. In this, his employers were sadly mistaken. 

 His lawyer, Anna Power, of Leeds-based Morrish amp; Co, who represented Khan at the employment tribunal, said: ?I am delighted that Mr Khan was successful in his claim. The regulations had been in force for a full five months at the time of the appeal hearing and the company should have been aware of the content of them and its responsibilities under them.?

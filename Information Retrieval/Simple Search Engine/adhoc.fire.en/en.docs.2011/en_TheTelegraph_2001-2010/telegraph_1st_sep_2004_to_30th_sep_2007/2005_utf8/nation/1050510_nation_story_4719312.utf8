 Jaya skips assets hearing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, May 9: Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa today stayed away from the special court trying two cases of undisclosed wealth against her as her counsel K.T.S. Tulasi pleaded that the cases be clubbed together.

 Senior Supreme Court counsel Tulasi, who made his first appearance for the Tamil Nadu chief minister today, is also the prosecuting lawyer in the temple manager murder case in which the Kanchi sankaracharya is embroiled.

 Citing his engagements in Kerala High Court tomorrow and the Supreme Court this week, Tulasi pleaded for an adjournment in the Jayalalithaa case hearing. Judge A.S. Pachhapure has adjourned it till May 16.

 The judge took exception to the plea for adjournment. At one point, he asked for applications in writing with reasons why the counsel wanted the hearing put off. Finally, the judge ruled that hearings would continue on a day-to-day basis from next Monday.

 Tulasi, who argued for nearly three hours, also requested that the hearings in the unaccounted wealth case and the London hotel ownership cases be clubbed together and the trial consolidated into one.

 Though the prosecution had filed a separate chargesheet, it ought to be treated as a supplementary chargesheet linked to the first case, he said.

 ?I would rather have a comprehensive acquittal than have one (case) hanging all the time. The prosecution has filed a separate case because it wants to prolong my agony,? Tulasi said.

 Jayalalithaa sought exemption from personal appearance in the court on grounds that she had to campaign for Tamil Nadu bypoll nominees.

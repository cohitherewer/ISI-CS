 Anara case

 New Delhi, Feb. 8 (PTI): In a new twist to the porn CD scandal allegedly involving Anara Gupta, a Chandigarh-based forensic laboratory has indicated that the pictures in it may indeed be those of the former beauty queen, contradicting a recent Hyderabad forensic laboratory clean chit.

 The Chandigarh report is believed to have said there was a resemblance with Anara regarding the lips, eyes and nose.

 On the basis of the Hyderbabad report, the Jammu and Kashmir police has already filed a petition seeking closure of the case against Anara, whose lawyers had threatened a defamation suit of Rs 1 crore against the police for ?implicating? her in the case.

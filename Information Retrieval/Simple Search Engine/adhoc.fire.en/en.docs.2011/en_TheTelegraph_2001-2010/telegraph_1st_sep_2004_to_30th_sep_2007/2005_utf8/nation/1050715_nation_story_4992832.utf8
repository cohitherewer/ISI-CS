 Paintings under fans fuel design row

 Bhopal, July 14: Paintings by M.F. Husain, J. Swaminathan, Manjit Bawa, Syed Hyder Raza and V.S. Gaitonde are being dried under fans after rainwater gushed into Bharat Bhavan, a multi-arts complex, on Tuesday.

 Over 3,000 paintings have been affected at Roopankar, the museum at the Bhavan which houses contemporary urban, folk and tribal art.

 Director Pawan Jain, however, appears optimistic. Except for water colours, all other paintings would be considerably restored, if not fully retrieved, the IPS officer said, blaming poor upkeep for the damage. Waterproofing was not done even once between 1982 and 2004.

 Jain also blamed architect Charles Correa who had designed the Bhavan. The art centre is located on a gently sloping plateau overlooking a lake and the city of Bhopal across the water. The director alleged that Correa had failed to take care of seepage from the lake.

 The complex has only one outlet with a six-inch radius to allow waste and rainwater to flow into the lake, Jain added.

 It has been raining heavily in Bhopal for over a fortnight.

 The paintings were in the store and artists say many of them were lying on the floor for cataloguing. 

 Jain admitted the damage was extensive as over 10,000 paintings ? oil on canvas and watercolour ? were in the store. But he said things could have been worse. Prompt action by graphic and ceramic artists working in a nearby workshop saved many valuable paintings, he said.

 Some Bharat Bhavan artists and employees, however, blamed the centres management. Asking not to be named, they said it was surprising that valuable paintings were carelessly dumped in the store.

 Manjit Bawa, former chief of the Bhavan, said from Delhi that the damage was not much. 

 Only a few paintings were destroyed. This is small-town politics. The paintings were in the storeroom. The rain was torrential and water seeped in through the door. Graphic artists were working there. They took the paintings out breaking the lock and saved them. I have not been to Bhopal but I have talked to many people, Bawa said.

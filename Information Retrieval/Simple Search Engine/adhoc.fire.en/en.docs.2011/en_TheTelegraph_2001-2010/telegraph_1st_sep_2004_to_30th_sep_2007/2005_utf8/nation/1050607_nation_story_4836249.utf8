 Andhra minister resigns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, June 6: The Andhra Pradesh government was rattled today with endowment minister M. Satyanarayana Rao, tainted in a temple land scam, tendering his resignation.

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, who ordered a judicial probe into the illegal sale of temple properties, has not accepted Raos resignation as the preliminary report by the anti-corruption bureau has not made any prima facie charges against him. 

 The judicial inquiry by a retired high court judge would unravel the truth. The culprits, however high they may be, will not be spared, Reddy said.

 Last week, the government had suspended five officials of the endowment department, including a deputy commissioner and two assistant commissioners. 

 However, no action has been initiated against endowment commissioner I. Venkateswarlu and secretary J.P. Murthy, the two IAS officers said to be instrumental in the deal. While Murthy has taken charge as home secretary, Venkateswarlu retired on May 31.

 The state cabinet yesterday discussed the fallout of the sale of nearly 246 acres of land worth Rs 100 crore by the officers before they were moved out of the department.

 Rao had offered to quit following the alleged disclosure that the bureaucrats had acted with the concurrence of the minister.

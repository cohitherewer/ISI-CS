 Sherawat plays a Sen

 Mumbai, March 2: Amartya Sen was away in Harvard and not available for comment but after P. Chidambaram, he has a new convert. Mallika Sherawat. Both in one eventful week.

 Before someone cries bloody murder, let?s just say that Mallika might have turned up in a skin-tight black-and-white top and black pants for a budget discussion but the language she spoke would gladden the Nobel laureate?s heart. ?Education. Rural heathcare. Small towns, like the place I come from,? she said.

 As industry captains expressed their happiness with the budget ? barring the fringe benefit tax and the tax on cash withdrawals of over Rs 10,000 from banks ? and the Left held its silence, it seemed the government?s critics had gone into hiding. 

 Into the void stepped in Mallika, the passionate adulteress in Murder, as the defender of real development. 

 At a discussion on the budget yesterday organised by MTV and CNBC, Mallika ? sharing the platform with industrialist Adi Godrej, Congress MP Milind Deora, tax expert Dilip Choksi, market analyst Ramesh Damani and colleague from the entertainment world Zayed Khan ? came down heavily on the body politic.

 As the discussion opened, with a group of 50-odd college students in the audience, the other panellists made suitable noises, welcoming the budget. Asked what she wanted out of it, Mallika said: ?Education, education, education, especially for the girl child.? 

 Godrej said the budget was ?very good?, mentioning in particular VAT. ?The value-added tax would bring down costs, increase production, bring down tax evasion and increase revenue for the government.? 

 He was a little sceptical about the tax on fringe benefits. But Mallika would not play on the fringes and spoke only about fundamentals.

 Pointed out that education and health received generous amounts this year, she challenged: ?All governments promise a lot of money, but why doesn?t the money trickle down to the poor??

 When Godrej said rural India was also growing, and Deora warned about the negative effect of being cynical, Mallika repeated herself. 

 When Mallika and Zayed were asked whether they minded the fact that the entertainment industry did not find a mention, they were both graceful and said they didn?t. ?It is secondary to infrastructure,? conceded Zayed, sporting for some reason dark glasses though it was late evening.

 Mallika was more vocal. She did not mind that entertainment was not in the picture. ?We must focus on larger issues. India has to change at the grassroots level. The youth has to be taken into participating in the country?s economy.?

 Choksi said the budget was extremely promising; Godrej said it was good that it was presented without much interference from the communists; Damani said it was up to the next generation to further the country?s cause; Zayed endorsed what someone said before him.

 But Mallika said: ?Education, education, education. To the underprivileged.? 

 Who said as public figures, Sen and Sherawat, whose figure is very public, don?t have much in common?

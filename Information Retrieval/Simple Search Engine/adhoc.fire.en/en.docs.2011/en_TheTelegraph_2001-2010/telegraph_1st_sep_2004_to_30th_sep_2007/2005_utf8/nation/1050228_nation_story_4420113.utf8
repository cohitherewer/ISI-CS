 Orissa braces for scorcher

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 27: The rising mercury has propelled the Orissa government into action mode.

 State revenue minister Manmohan Samal, who recently chaired a high level meeting in this regard, said the government will release Rs 22 crore from the Calamity Relief Fund for contingency measures. It has also directed the departments concerned to release canal water, immediately repair defunct tube-wells, change the schedules for educational institutions as well as labourers, ensure proper power supply and alter bus timings.

 The revised schedule for all schools and colleges in the state would be from 6 am to 11 am while for daily wage labourers, the meeting fixed the timing from 7 am to 11 am and again from 3.30 pm to 7.30 pm.

 Rest sheds will be constructed for labourers and adequate drinking water provided in industries and offices, Samal said.

 The government has also asked the district collectors to supervise and monitor water-serving points at all bus stands, market areas and village panchayats.

 Samal said March 15 has been fixed as the deadline for repairing all defunct tube-wells. Besides, new ones would also be sunk on a war footing. The meeting has asked the state energy department to repair the defunct lift irrigation points at the earliest while it directed the water resources department to immediately release canal water for the benefit of farmers.

 All district collectors will have to convene meetings at the respective headquarters in the first week of March and take appropriate steps to deal with the situation.

 The health department has been asked to keep adequate stock of medicines, saline, packets of ORS and ice in the hospitals and primary centres across the state.

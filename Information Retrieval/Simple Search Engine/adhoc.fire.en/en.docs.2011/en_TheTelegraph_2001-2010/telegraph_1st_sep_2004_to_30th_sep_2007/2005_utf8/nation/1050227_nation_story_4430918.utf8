 Ousted Renuka aide cries foul

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Renuka Chowdhury, union minister of tourism, has a fight on her hands.

 Ousted tourism secretary Uma Pillai today said she would take up the fight with the minister over controversial purchase of a large consignment of Johnnie Walker whisky by Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) from Diageo at an ?appropriate forum?.

 Reacting to the allegations of misconduct made against her by the tourism minister, Pillai said: ?The charges are incorrect. I am bound by the code of conduct for government servants. I will take it up at an appropriate forum.?

 Pillai was recently transferred to a department under the ministry of health and is expected to take charge next week.

 Enmeshed in controversy over the largescale transfers in her ministry and ITDC, Chowdhury had reportedly charged Pillai with misusing her official position. 

 Apparently, the former secretary became the minister?s target when she suggested that the tourism ministry should keep out of ITDC?s commercial dealings. This is because the corporation was not ready to let the minister usurp its financial powers.

 Johnnie Walker brands have disappeared from ITDC?s duty-free shops as a result of the controversy.

 Rajeev Talwar, new chairman and managing director of ITDC who succeeded Amitabh Kant, said the shortage of premium liquor brands will bet met.

 ?We have excess scotch whiskies and this will be provided to Delhi duty-free shops from other regions,? he said.

 He, however, declined to share information on whether the tourism ministry was seeking another probe into alleged irregularities in liquor purchases by the corporation?s duty-free shops.

 ?I have no idea... Vigilance is not in my area... This is under the ministry,? he said.

 In an interview to a national daily, Chowdhury said: ?Get ready to live without Black Label or Red Label whiskies. I am going to blacklist them (UDV) for unnecessarily creating a controversy.?

 However, UDV, the Diageo subsidiary, maintained that ?things will get better in future as the problem is being resolved?. Amar Raj Singh, managing director of UDV (India) said: ?We are a substantial part of ITDC?s business. We are talking to ITDC and things are expected to get better.?

 Singh claimed: ?UDV has quoted the lowest price for selling its famous scotch whisky in the entire subcontinent. We are priced lower than any of our competitors.? 

 Denying the scotch major was selling liquor to ITDC far above the market price, he said: ?We have documentary proof. In fact, over the last 10 years, we haven?t raised prices by a penny. Rather our discounts have gone up.?

 Singh said ITDC owes it nearly Rs 17 crore (?1.5 million).

 Chowdhury has sought a second CBI probe into the purchase of the Johnnie Walker brands by ITDC from the UDV Diageo of Scotland. The CBI had found no case when the matter was first referred to it.

 Mine cover for Naxalite cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 15: The home ministry has decided to equip paramilitary forces with over 150 mine-proof vehicles (MPV) in view of the rise in casualties among the forces in Naxalite-affected states.

 Many of the paramilitary forces in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and other states have died due to mine blasts. Therefore, a decision was taken to provide paramilitary forces with MPVs, said home secretary V.K. Duggal.

 Paramilitary forces think that upgrade of equipment, particularly armoured vehicles and remote sensing satellites used to take images of Naxalite camps, can greatly improve the efficiency and confidence of the personnel.

 As of now, we (paramilitary forces) have only 50 MPVs, which are not enough to cover all the areas in different states infested with militant outfits and Naxalites who are getting into the habit of laying mines. The ministry has decided to buy 100 more of these vehicles from ordnance factories. A decision regarding which vehicles to buy will be taken after a visit to the Medak Ordnance Factory by a team of officials and the home minister, said an official.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil along with top home ministry officials and directors-general of the Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the National Security Guards inspected an MPV manufactured by the ordnance factory board here. The MPV, with a capacity of 12 soldiers, can be used in counter-insurgency operations and can ply at 85 km per hour.

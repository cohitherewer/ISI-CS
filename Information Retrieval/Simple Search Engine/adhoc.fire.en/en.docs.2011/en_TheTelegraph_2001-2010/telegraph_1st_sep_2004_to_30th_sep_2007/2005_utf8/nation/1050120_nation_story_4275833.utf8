 Patch-up whispers after signal of hope

 Jayendra Saraswati: What next?

 Chennai, Jan. 19: After the meeting, whispers of a rapprochement.

 Last night?s meeting between Jayendra Saraswati and M. Natarajan, the estranged husband of Jayalalithaa?s close associate Sasikala, marks a new phase in Tamil Nadu?s stand-off with the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt, sources said today.

 Given his ?love-hate relationship? with Poes Garden, the chief minister?s residence, the sources said even if Natarajan was not carrying any brief from the government, the meeting signals a subtle attitudinal shift towards the seer, the first accused in the Shankar Raman murder case.

 They said that with three days to go for police to file the chargesheet, the moral support from Natarajan ? who is linked to the Dravidian movement and openly claims he is ?not a religious person? ? must have come as a shot in the arm for Jayendra Saraswati.

 After his one-hour meeting with the acharya, Natarajan had said he had ?neither come as a messenger nor as a messiah? but added that the state?s action against the mutt was ?unwarranted, unjustified and illogical?.

 Natarajan?s meeting with Jayendra Saraswati has come at a time when the entire spectrum of Dravidian parties and the Left has been openly praising Jayalalithaa for taking action against the seer and his junior Vijayendra Saraswati, the second accused in the case.

 Moreover, the sources added, after the Supreme Court?s bail order in which it observed that ?no worthwhile prima facie evidence apart from the alleged confessions? of the senior pontiff had been brought to its ?notice?, the Jayalalithaa government?s stand had only hardened.

 The state, they pointed out, had moved the apex court seeking deletion of certain remarks from the bail order while Jayalalithaa issued a statement on Sunday defending the police investigation and ruling out withdrawal of the case against the seers.

 So even if Natarajan told reporters last night at Kalavai that he was ?far away from the power centre?, the sources said, the meeting showed that the government cannot ignore the mutt?s senior pontiff. 

 The sources also pointed out that the move by some individuals close to the ruling ADMK to prop up Vijayendra Saraswati as the de facto pontiff when his senior was in jail had failed.

 As only Jayendra Saraswati can formally nominate the next pontiff of the Kanchi mutt, the meeting, they said, signalled that the government has sensed the inevitability of having to contend with him irrespective of the direction the case takes.

 Natarajan, a former public relations officer with the state government, had said there was very little he could do to end the stand-off as ?matters have gone beyond that stage?. But his emphatic assertion that the government should not be ?so aggressive? could be the first step towards a rapprochement.

 If Natarajan?s comments have triggered speculation, a remark of the junior pontiff is also significant. Vijayendra Saraswati, who was sent back to judicial custody after his one-day police remand ended this afternoon, told reporters that all ?these obstacles placed against us will come to an end soon?.

 The junior pontiff was produced before first class judicial magistrate G. Uthamaraj, who remanded him in judicial custody till January 24.

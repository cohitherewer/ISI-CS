 Delhi clears air on ties with Tokyo

 New Delhi, April 30: The full extent of Japan?s keenness to enter into a strategic partnership with India may not yet be clear, but Delhi has decided to clarify that the elevation of bilateral relations was not aimed at cornering China.

 ?We do not want to get involved in Sino-Japanese problems,? a source in the government said.

 India and Japan signed a strategic partnership agreement yesterday after a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and his Indian counterpart and host Manmohan Singh. A few weeks earlier, Singh had signed a similar agreement with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao when the latter came to Delhi on an official visit.

 Koizumi?s visit to India took place at a time when the Chinese Premier had managed to bring about a breakthrough in Beijing?s ties with Delhi by not only entering into a strategic partnership but also inking a series of significant documents, including one which showed the intention of the two countries to settle their boundary dispute.

 Koizumi also decided to come to Delhi at a time when Sino-Japanese relations have nosedived over Beijing?s decision to bring back ?atrocities? committed by Japan on the Chinese during World War II on the diplomatic centrestage.

 There has been widespread speculation that Japan?s late realisation of India?s worth has much to do with the serious engagement that most key international players, particularly the US, have entered into with Delhi. But it has been spurred by the Chinese Premier?s successful visit earlier this month.

 Conscious that Japan and many other countries in the region would like to see India play a role to counter-balance China, Delhi has clarified that it has no such intentions.

 ?India, China and Japan should be the three countries which will have to be the anchors for the stability and progress of Asia,? the source said. But it was also pointed out that this does not mean that India will have to choose between China and Japan.

 ?It?s not a zero-sum game in foreign policy any longer,? a senior official said. ?Success begets success,? he added, explaining why Tokyo was keen on a strategic partnership. ?We have nothing to lose by entering into such partnerships with either China or Japan. Both are major countries in Asia and we want good and strong relations with both.?

 Sino-Indian trade has shown drastic growth in the past two years and has already reached over $13.6 billion. The two sides want to reach a target of $40 billion by 2010. 

 In comparison, Indo-Japanese trade has remained stagnant at $4 billion for some years now. 

 Attempts are now being made by the two sides to increase foreign direct investment by Tokyo in India as well as the bilateral trade volume.

 India does not have any historical disputes with Japan unlike many other countries. But so far it has not been on the top of Japan?s foreign policy objectives.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Prod to govt on heritage force 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The Supreme Court today gave the central government eight weeks to respond to a petition that proposed forming a special force for guarding objects of historic importance so that thefts like Rabindranath Tagore?s Nobel medallion do not recur.

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha took serious view of the fact that the Centre had not yet responded to the notice the court had issued on a public interest litigation, which was filed immediately after the theft of the medal in March last year.

 The petition was filed by social and environmental activist Subhash Datta, who contended that a special force should be formed with people trained in history and archaeology so that they have enough knowledge on objects of historical and archaeological importance.

 In today?s proceedings, Datta drew the court?s attention to the recent theft of the fifth century Buddha bust ?lifted? from the Indian Museum in Calcutta. At this, Justice Sinha observed: ?Even the Prime Minister expressed concern about the theft of the bust.?

 Datta, appointed amicus curiae by Calcutta High Court in many environment-related cases and who has also taken up several archaeology-related causes, pointed out that trained security personnel have been deployed in the London museum where Karl Marx researched for over nine years before writing Das Kapital.

 ?Now with the theft of the fifth century art object from the Calcutta museum, India, too, should try to develop a similar force with proper training and education of the personnel who should be made to feel proud about the country?s cultural and emotional wealth,? he argued.

 Datta said there were special forces like the Border Security Force for the border, Railway Protection Force for the railway, the Central Industrial Security Force and ?even for the most unwanted tribe, the politicians, there are special groups like Black Cats (and) Special Protection Group?. But for ?historic antiques and art objects?, there was ?no force in force?.

 ?Everyone is wanting a CBI inquiry now in the Tagore case, but prevention is better than cure. Train the force both martially and art consciously? provide them special salary packages,? he said.

 Till such a force is created, ?there should be an inventory for all such objects throughout the country, kept in a central place like Delhi, on which periodic verification should be done by a competent agency like the comptroller and auditor general of India or any other similar agency?, Datta contended.

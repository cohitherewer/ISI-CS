 Blow to Dalmiya

 Chennai, March 19: Madras High Court today declined to exempt the former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Jagmohan Dalmiya, from appearing before a city court in a contempt case, reports our special correspondent.

 Justice S.M. Ibrahim Khalifullah declined to grant the relief sought by Dalmiya through his lawyer and senior advocate Somayaji.

 The sixth city civil court judge, Justice Mohideen Pitachi, yesterday directed Dalmiya and the present secretary of the BCCI, S.K. Nair, to appear before it on Monday for contempt of court.

 The contempt notices to Dalmiya and Nair, returnable on Monday, were issued on a petition filed by the Chennai-based Thyagaraya Recreation Club. 

 The petition was filed after the former BCCI president attended a meeting of the executive committee of the International Cricket Council in New Delhi on Thursday.

 The petitioner claimed that Dalmiya and the BCCI had violated the January 25 order of the court, which restrained the board from nominating him as its representative to ICC meetings.

 Cong uneasy, but safe in seat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: The Congress is a trifle uneasy with the hardliner tag Prakash Karat has but the party leadership does not see the CPM change in guard affecting the stability of the government.

 ?It is said and often reported in the press that he (Karat) is a hardliner. Maybe it is true, maybe it is not. But like every political party, the appointment of a leader is the CPM?s internal affair.

 ?We do not think the leadership change will have any bearing on the UPA government. After all, he was very much a top leader when the CPM collectively decided to extend outside support to the UPA government last year,? a Congress official said. 

 The Congress today officially welcomed Karat?s ascent to the post of CPM general secretary. Spokesman Anand Sharma said both parties were one on issues regarding deprived sections of the society though the CPM has its distinct ideology and agenda.

 The unease in the Congress has to do with Karat?s relative unfamiliarity with party leaders. Very few Congress leaders interacted with him at the time of formation of the UPA government last May and even after that.

 For Congress leaders, Karat is a reclusive CPM ideologue. As H.S. Surjeet, Jyoti Basu and Sitaram Yechury have handled much of the political interaction with the Congress and other UPA partners, they feel the trio will continue to guide and handle matters.

 However, a Congress leader involved with drawing up the common minimum programme (CMP) said Karat had been directly on the job. Till the final document took shape, the text of each one of the six drafts was personally vetted by him, he said.

 ?The CMP is the agreed agenda of the UPA which has the full endorsement and support of the CPM. The government is fully committed to implementing all CMP promises. Our commitment is reflected in action over the last 11 months,? Sharma said.

 The Congress has no doubt about the continued support of the CPM and other Left parties, Sharma said. If any problem cropped up, the UPA-Left coordination committee would handle it, he said.

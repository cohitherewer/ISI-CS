 BJP in power protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 30: The BJPs state-wide protests against the Democratic Front governments handling of the power crunch in the state today turned violent with police resorting to lathicharge at some places to control the protesters.

 BJP state president Nitin Gadkari and national vice-president Gopinath Munde courted arrest in Nagpur and Phulambri near Aurangabad with more than 100 activists.

 The protests began at 10 am with activists blocking roads in Nagpur, Nanded, Parbhani, Hingoli, Jalna, Akola, Aurangabad, Beed, Latur, and Osmanabad. BJP activists took to the streets in Solapur, Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur.

 Activists led by Munde blocked traffic near Phulambri for more than four hours and damaged two state transport buses by pelting stones.

 The police resorted to a lathicharge to clear the roads, injuring nine BJP activists.

 In Wardha, the activists stormed the MSEB office at Borgaon and damaged furniture and computers before a lathicharge by the police brought the situation under control.

 Munde later accused the government of using force to quell the agitation, and warned the government that the party will intensify its protests.

 Shiv Sena and the BJP both have resorted to violent protests against the power crisis in the state. Maharashtra currently faces a 3,500 MW power shortage, and has resorted to stringent loadshedding across the state.

 The State Power MInister Dilip Walse Patil was scheduled to meet the MSEB unions to discuss the power situation and the restructuring of the MSEB. The left-led unions have threatened an agitation from Tuesday to protest against the restructuring the state electricity boards.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and CPM Prakash Karat differed on the issue, with the PM supporting the move to restructure loss-making state electricity boards in 11 states, while the Left parties have opposed the move.

 Schedule cloud on Cong plenary

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: The Congress may knock on the Election Commissions doors for a re-look at the Bihar poll schedule.

 The dates clash with the partys plenary session scheduled in Hyderabad between October 20 and 22. 

 Other parties like the CPI and the NCP have also expressed reservations about the timetable, saying the first two phases coincided with Dussehra and Ramadan.

 Several other parties publicly welcomed the dates, but said in private that they wanted a shorter schedule.

 The Congress is caught in a dilemma. It would be difficult for our national and Bihar leaders to campaign for the second phase of polling since all of us would be attending the plenary session, said Congress general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi. 

 Senior party functionaries felt that either the Bihar poll schedule or the plenary dates would have to be changed.

 Our main campaigner, Sonia Gandhi, will have to be present in Hyderabad for three days that are also crucial days of campaigning for the second phase of polling, added general secretary Ambika Soni. 

 Soni and her senior colleagues discussed the situation with Sonia late this evening. While rescheduling the plenary is a possibility, Sonia is unlikely to take a decision in haste. 

 The leadership wants to wait and see whether the commission will review the dates on its own following suggestions that the schedule clashes with the festival season.

 Soni felt that there was nothing sacrosanct about the schedule. The party has also taken into account reservations expressed by the Left over the schedule. 

 She indicated that the party could consider joining the Left parties to appeal to the commission to reconsider the dates. We hope the commission would review the dates. We will discuss the matter with other parties, she added.

 Soni said the poll schedule would make it difficult for parties to sustain their campaign. It would also be more expensive for the candidates.

 Assaulter Bobbitised

 Patna, May 11: A 16-year-old girl of a Muzaffarpur village has allegedly done a Bobbit on a man accused of trying to rape her, reports our correspondent.

 The attack on the girl, which took place on May 2, came to light eight days later when her father filed a case at Gaighat police station.

 Earlier, the panchayat took up the case and banished the accused for 15 years and fined his father Rs 5,100.

 The girl, a resident of Balaha Nanakar, had gone to cut grass along with a friend in the evening when Rambabu, who stayed in the same village, allegedly tried to rape her. Twenty-eight-year-old Rambabu has two children and stayed near the girls house.

 According to the complaint, the girl inflicted a deep cut on the genitals of the accused with a blade, following which he fled.

 Killer don convicted

 - kenneth regan wiped out chohan family for greed 

 PHILIPPE NAUGHTON

 Chohan with wife 

 Nancy and son Devinder 

 London, July 1: An underworld 

 boss was convicted at the Old Bailey today of murdering 

 a businessman and three generations of his family for greed.

 Kenneth Regan executed Amarjit 

 Chohan and four of his relatives so he could take over his 

 freight company and use it as a front for drug-running. 

 He was convicted of the murders by a jury today on its 13th 

 day of deliberations.

 His accomplice, William Horncy, 

 was also found guilty of the murders. A third man, Peter 

 Rees, was convicted of Chohans murder and of assisting 

 an offender, but cleared of the other four murder charges.

 Chohan, his wife Nancy, their 

 two young sons, Devinder and Ravinder, together with Nancys 

 mother Charanjit Kaur, disappeared in February 

 2003 and were later murdered.

 Chohans body was found floating 

 in the sea near Bournemouth pier in April that year and 

 his wifes recovered in the same area in July. Kaurs 

 was found in November 2003 in a bay off the Isle of Wight.

 The bodies of the boys are still 

 missing.

 Some crimes are beyond belief 

 and on any view these horrific murders fall into that category, 

 Richard Horwell, prosecuting, had told the court during 

 Regans trial.

 Regan planned to make people think 

 Chohan, from Hounslow, West London, had given up his business 

 and gone abroad voluntarily. The convicted drug dealer then 

 intended to run the freight company his way, using it as 

 a front for the importation of drugs.

 Regan lured Belinda Brewin ? a 

 friend of the late television presenter Paula Yates ? into 

 his scheme.

 Unknown to her, he used her 50-acre 

 estate at Great Colefield House, Stoodleigh, Tiverton, Devon, 

 to secretly bury the Chohan family.

 The mass grave was dug up in April 

 and the bodies dumped in the English Channel when Brewin 

 became suspicious and contacted police.

 After she gave evidence against 

 Regan at his trial, Brewin received a death threat from 

 an anonymous source, which police are currently probing.

 Regan, 55, of Forge Close, Wilton, 

 near Salisbury, Wiltshire, had denied murdering the five. 

 He fled to Spain and then to Belgium as police moved in. 

 He was arrested in Ghent in the August and brought back 

 to England to stand trial.

 The trial, which began last November, 

 is believed to be one of the longest murder trials in criminal 

 history and cost upwards of ?10 million.

 Assistant commissioner Tarique 

 Ghaffur, in charge of Scotland Yards specialist crime 

 directorate, said he had never come across such a tragic 

 case in 30 years of police work.

 You have a situation that 

 out of complete greed, criminals infiltrate a legitimate 

 business and kill a whole family for no other purpose than 

 to get money for themselves, Ghaffur said.

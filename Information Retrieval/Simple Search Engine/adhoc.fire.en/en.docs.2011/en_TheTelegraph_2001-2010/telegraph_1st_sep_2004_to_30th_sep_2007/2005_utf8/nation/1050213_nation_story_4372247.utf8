 Italians eye design talent

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: Istituto Europeo di Design, a renowned designing school of Italy, is coming here to woo Indian students.

 The institution, along with three top Italian universities ? Politechnico of Milan, University of La Sapienza of Rome and University of Palermo, will hold a workshop and an exhibition at the Habitat Centre on Wednesday on different courses and the career prospects of the students studying there.

 The workshop coincides with Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi?s five-day visit to India beginning today. The visit will focus on strengthening economic and cultural ties.

 Fashion designer J.J. Vallaya said: ?It is a good thing that international institutes are now training their eyes on India.? In the last couple of years, he said, India has found a place for itself in the international fashion industry. Not only are Indian designers holding shows abroad, they are even impressing big names like Armani.

 ?There is immense talent in India and the presence of international institutes will give our youngsters an exposure overseas. I think soon we will have more schools like these coming to set up shops here,? Vallaya said.

 Another fashion designer, Ashish Soni, said so far there were only a few good fashion schools in the country. With international institutes, the industry will get a boost. ?There is a huge gap between the number of aspirants and the number of seats available in a good fashion school. At least, the doors are now opening up for our students,? Soni said.

 Besides a few key ministers, the Italian President will be accompanied by a large number of businessmen, including chief executives of leading Italian companies like car manufacturer Ferrari.

 Sources said Ferrari?s latest car, which is priced at 150,000 euros, will be on display at an exhibition, which is part of the Italy-India Business Forum meeting at Delhi?s Pragati Maidan that Ciampi will inaugurate.

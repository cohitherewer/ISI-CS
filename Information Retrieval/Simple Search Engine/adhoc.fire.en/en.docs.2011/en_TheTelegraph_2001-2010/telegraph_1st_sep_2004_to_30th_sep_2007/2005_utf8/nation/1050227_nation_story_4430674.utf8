 Vintage wit missing, on eve of D-day

 KAY BENEDICT

New Delhi, Feb. 26: A day before counting in 

Bihar, it was not the vintage Laloo Prasad Yadav who presented the railway budget 

today.

 With most pollsters putting a question mark over the chances of his Rashtriya Janata Dal, Laloo Prasad?s body language suggested he was no longer confident of doing a Jyoti Basu. He had said earlier that the RJD would rule Bihar for 20 years, as Basu had done in Bengal. The party has completed 15 years in office.

 The railway minister did pepper his 105-minute speech with some rustic wit and poetry, but was far from his usual confident self.

 Last year, when Laloo Prasad presented his first budget, his children were watching from the visitors? gallery. Today, they are huddled at 1, Anne Marg in Patna, anxiously awaiting the election results that will decide the fate of their chief minister mother, Rabri Devi.

 After presenting the budget, Laloo Prasad held two news conferences, in his Parliament House office and at Rail Bhavan. At both, he stuck to the budget proposals and refused to discuss the elections.

 Later, the RJD chief took the 7.30 pm flight to Patna to monitor the counting, which starts at 8 am tomorrow.

 The walkout by the NDA members, who boycotted the budget, came as a relief to Laloo Prasad as he was able to finish his speech without interruptions. As soon as he rose to present the budget, NDA members were on their feet protesting the presence of ?tainted? persons in the government.

 Laloo Prasad, in spotless white kurta-pyjama and a yellow sweater, was seen gesticulating to them to go. When some BJP-Shiv Sena members continued to shout before walking out, he was heard saying: ?Whenever I rise to speak, they show their back to me.? The BJP objected to the comment.

 Die-hard socialist that he is, Laloo Prasad quoted revolutionary poet Nagarjuna?s couplet while proposing no increase in passenger fares. ?Jaan lo bhaiya, garibon ki ek hoti jaat, usi ke hukum se hilenge ek-ek paat (Let it be known brother, that the poor have only one caste. Without their direction the leaves do not move).?

 ?Considering the advice of Nagarjuna Baba, I do not propose to increase any fares in this budget,? the minister said, quoting the couplet from the book Apne Khet Mein authored by the poet from Bihar. 

 Some of the couplets Laloo Prasad sprinkled his speech with also reflect the mood in his party. ?Pa hi lenge, aakhir manjil rahon ki mohtaz nahin, saath ho ummidon ka, kal hoga wahi jo aaj nahin (We will achieve, after all the goal is not subject to the paths, with hope for company, what could not happen today will happen tomorrow).?

 Committing himself to bringing down the operating ratio, which is the ratio of expenditure to earnings, he said: ?Jeevan ke har path par maali pushp nahi bikhrata hai, pragati ka path aksar pathrila hi hota hai (The gardener does not scatter flowers on all life?s paths, the path of progress is often full of stones).?

 When reporters asked him later if the poetry in the budget was his own or the Prime Minister?s, Laloo Prasad laughed that it was from ?the learned railway officials?. 

The minister did raise laughs during the budget speech 

when he bantered over pronouncing tongue-twisting names of places in south India.

A passenger was stabbed to death and two seriously 

injured when they tried to overpower armed robbers on a New Delhi-bound train 

between Doraha and Jaspalon stations in Ludhiana district early on Saturday.

About eight robbers entered the general compartment 

of the Jalandhar-New Delhi superfast train around 6.20 am and started looting 

passengers. When the passengers tried to stop them, the robbers attacked, killing 

Swarn Singh, railway police said.

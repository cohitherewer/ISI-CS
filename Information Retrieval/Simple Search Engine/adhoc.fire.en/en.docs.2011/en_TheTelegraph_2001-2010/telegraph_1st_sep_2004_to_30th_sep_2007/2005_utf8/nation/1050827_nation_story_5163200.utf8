The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ten Sports drops out of bid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: Over a years controversy behind it, the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias latest telecast rights tender process saw a dramatic turn today with Ten Sports, one of the top contenders, opting out of the race.

 The Dubai-based broadcaster failed to submit the interest-free tender deposit of $3 million yesterday, 24 hours prior to the submission of bid, as stipulated by BCCIs invitation to tender document. The bids closed at 2 pm today.

 Three other private broadcasters ? ESPN-STAR Sports, Sony and Zee ? and national broadcaster Doordarshan put in their bids for telecast rights to international and domestic cricket in India in the next four years.

 BCCI executive secretary in-charge Ratnakar Shetty said it is up to board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra to call a meeting of the boards marketing committee to take the process forward.

 The board is likely to evaluate the technical aspects of the bidders first ? whether they meet the eligibility criteria ? before looking into the amounts that the companies have offered, and then deciding on the winner. The process is expected to take a week.

 Although Ten officials refused comment on why the company withdrew from the bidding process despite procuring the tender form, according to sources, several factors prompted the sports channel to do so.

 Ten already has at least four tournaments up to 2006 featuring India, including the coveted India-Pakistan series in Pakistan next year, and felt the BCCI rights was not a life-and-death matter.

 It was also wary of the legal battle between Zee and BCCI dragging on like last time, leading to tournaments being removed from the list and the total value of the property coming down. 

 Ten had also considered a combined bid with Sony, with which it has a distribution arrangement, but backed out of it subsequently.

 As far as the invitation to tender is concerned, most broadcasters feel the base price of $2.14 million per day for rights to 139 days of cricket, set by BCCI, is too high to make any profit.

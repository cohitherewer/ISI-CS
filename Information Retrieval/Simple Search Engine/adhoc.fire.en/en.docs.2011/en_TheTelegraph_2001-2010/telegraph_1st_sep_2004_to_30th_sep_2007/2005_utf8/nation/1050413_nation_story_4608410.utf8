 Cheating case 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: A retired rear admiral has had an FIR registered against him by the naval board for allegedly trying to pass off his father-in-law as his father to secure some benefits.

 The complaint of cheating against Rear Admiral (Retd) K.R. Srinivasan, an AVSM recipient and chief hydrographer to the government for a decade, was lodged this month by A.L. Narayan, officer in charge of the Ex-Serviceman Contributory Health Scheme.

 Srinivasan has been accused of replacing the photograph of his father, who died in 2003, with that of his father-in-law in documents to avail medical and other benefits.

 A junior commissioned officer who was close to the family of Srinivasan, the third highest ranking naval officer before his retirement last year, discovered the flaw.

 The FIR also says Srinivasan submitted an affidavit to the Naval Board stating his father was alive and wanted to claim health benefits.

 The board set up an inquiry but could not get Srinivasan to comply as he had already retired. This prompted the police complaint.

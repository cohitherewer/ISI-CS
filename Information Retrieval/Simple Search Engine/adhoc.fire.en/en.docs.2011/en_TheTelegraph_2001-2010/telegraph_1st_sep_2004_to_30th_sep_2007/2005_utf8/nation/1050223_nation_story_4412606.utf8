 Bail blow to gutka baron

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Feb. 22: Bombay High Court today rejected gutka king Rasiklal Dhariwal?s appeal to cancel the non-bailable warrant issued by a special court for his alleged links with the underworld while the special court rejected the bail plea of Rajesh Pancharia, a main accused in the gutka case.

 Pancharia is the son-in-law of Goa Gutka owner Jagdish Joshi, who, like Dhariwal, has a non-bailable warrant against him in the same case and is in Dubai since October.

 Dhariwal, who owns the Manikchand group, had told the high court that he would come to India in March and challenged the special court order and appealed for the cancellation of the warrant. He argued that he was not evading police, but was living outside India for a stipulated period to maintain his NRI status. 

 The bench of Justices R.M.S. Khandeparkar and P.V. Kakade, however, refused to accept this argument.

 Dhariwal further said a court could not issue a warrant to aid an investigation. The court observed that the warrant had asked Dhariwal to present himself before the special court and this did not amount to aiding an investigation.

 The high court also said the investigating agency ? the CBI is probing the case ? had the power to call any person for questioning and if that person avoided interrogation, then it had the right to procure warrants against him.

 The prosecution said since allegations have been levelled against Dhariwal and Joshi under the MCOCA, it was absolutely essential to question them in custody.

 But the court adjourned to February 28 the plea of Joshi to cancel the non-bailable warrant against him as he has promised to appear before the bureau on February 25.

 Dhariwal?s lawyer said his client would arrive in India in March after he completes 180 days abroad. He said Dhariwal was willing to answer questions through video-conferencing from Dubai. He added that Dhariwal had also said two officials could be sent to question him in Dubai and he would pay the price of their tickets.

 Dhariwal alleged that the police had suppressed his letters to them that explained his absence, but the prosecution said the letters were produced before the special court. 

 The prosecution said the gutka kings had repeatedly refused to come to India.

 Joshi?s lawyer Sirish Gupte told the court that he would return on February 24 night and appear before the CBI the next day. Like Dhariwal, Joshi had also challenged the special court order and pleaded that he could not return earlier in order to maintain his NRI status.

 The two are accused of having links with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in Karachi and helping him set up a gutka factory for his brother Anees there. Pancharia, along with Jumbo alias Jamiruddin, has been accused of extorting money and smuggling machinery parts to Karachi to set up the factory. 

 The special court rejected his bail plea on the grounds that there was prima facie evidence against him of smuggling gutka-manufacturing machinery to Pakistan to help the underworld gutka business. 

 Pancharia denied any involvement with the underworld. He said he had sent the machines to Dubai, which he later learnt were sent to Pakistan for use in a gutka factory owned by Dawood?s brother Anees.

 The names of Dhariwal and Joshi cropped up during Jumbo?s investigation, who spilled the beans on the barons? underworld links.

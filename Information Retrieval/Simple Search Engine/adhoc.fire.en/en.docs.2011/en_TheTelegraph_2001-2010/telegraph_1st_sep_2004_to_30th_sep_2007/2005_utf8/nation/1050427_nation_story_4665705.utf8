The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Airtel and Hutch cut roaming rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: Airtel and Hutch have slashed their mobile roaming charges by 33 per cent.

 Airtel?s roaming subscribers will pay Rs 3.99 against Rs 5.15 a minute earlier. 

 The new roaming charge of Rs 3.99 will include 30 paise as interconnect user charge and Rs 1.70 as the network surcharge. The network surcharge is payable to the government.

 A mobile customer registered in Calcutta while travelling to Delhi, or any other part of the country, will now pay Rs 3.99 when calling or receiving a call. It includes STD, roaming and air time rates. 

 The reduced tariffs will come into effect from May 1, 2005, and will benefit more than 35 million mobile customers.

 Currently, private telecom operators charge a roaming rate of Rs 3 to 6 a minute.

 Similar announcements are likely to be made by other mobile operators in the next few days.

 Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran today asked private mobile operators to reduce roaming charges. He pointed out that state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd does not charge for roaming.

 A senior executive of a leading private telecom company said: ?The rates can further come down if the government removes the artificial rates in the telecom industry.?

 The ?artificial? rates are access deficit charge, which operators have to pay as subsidy for rural mobile telephony, and interconnect user charge, which is a fee paid for moving a call from one operator?s network to another?s. 

 Speaking at the inaugural session of Cellular Summit 2005, Maran said: ?I feel the roaming charges today are very, very high. It has to go down. I am saying this because there are no roaming charges by BSNL mobile.?

 Maran offered to remove some of the hurdles for mobile operators if roaming charges were cut.

 ?Why can?t private mobile operators take the initiative of reducing roaming charges? On our part, the government is seriously considering to remove the inter-circle barriers for mobile-to-mobile calls. We are serious. I am sure all operators can be serious too and reduce the roaming charges,? he said.

 Mobile-to-mobile calls within the network of the same operator, but across two telecom circles, become more expensive because the calls have to be routed through national long distance operators like BSNL or Reliance or Bharti Telecom. A call carriage charge has to be paid to these operators.

 Maran also asked private operators not to lobby the government or his ministry to push through their demands, focusing instead on expanding the market.

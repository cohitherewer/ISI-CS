 Shut out of temple, seer stomps off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Jayendra Saraswati

 Chennai, July 15: After the snub, came the sorry. But for Kanchi acharya Jayendra Saraswati, nothing short of official permission would do.

 The seer, who was yesterday denied entry to the sanctum sanctorum of the Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameshwaram, left the town in a huff when his letter of appeal for official consent went unanswered.

 The acharya, accused in the Shankar Raman murder case, was in town to perform the abishegam (sacred bathing) of the Shiva linga, a privilege bestowed on only three persons ? the other two are the Sringeri mutt seer and the king of Nepal.

 He was invited by the temple priests late last evening after they apologised for yesterdays incident. The priests had cited an order from the temples executive officer, Subramaniam, for blocking his entry.

 Sources in Rameshwaram said the seer had later sent a letter to Subramaniam, an official of the governments Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR amp; CE) department, seeking formal consent.

 With no reply in sight till 9.30 am, the acharya left for Chennai, the sources said. 

 Attempts to reach Subramaniam were in vain. However, one of his colleagues said the officer did not pass any order on the seers letter.

 The letter was also referred to the HR amp; CE department higher-ups in Chennai. But with no orders from above, Subramaniam left things at that, the sources said. 

 Yesterday, the acharya had to make do with only a darshan of the Lord from a distance. The sources said Subramaniam was not at the temple yesterday when the priests stopped the seer.

 Nobody is allowed in the early hours when the spatika linga puja is being done by the priests inside the sanctum sanctorum. Entry is permitted usually only after 8 am, but the acharya had come at 5.30 am, the official said, explaining yesterdays fiasco.

 But a source in the Kanchi mutt countered: If that explanation is true, the temple authorities should have given a suitable alternative time for the Kanchi acharya to perform his special puja. 

 Mutt sources alleged that a large posse of policemen had been posted at the temples entrance today to intimidate the seer. We also had information that the state might find some excuse to arrest the acharya again if he entered the temple today, a source said.

 The seer was keen on performing the abishegam as a prelude to the chaturmasya vrata, which he will observe from next week.

 Following yesterdays incident, the mutt announced that the acharya and the junior pontiff, Vijayendra Saraswati, would observe the chaturmasya in Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh from July 21 to September 18. 

 BJP vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu today poured scorn on the temple action. It is shocking and surprising that the acharya was not allowed entry into the temples sanctum. The state government needs to clarify for denying him permission.

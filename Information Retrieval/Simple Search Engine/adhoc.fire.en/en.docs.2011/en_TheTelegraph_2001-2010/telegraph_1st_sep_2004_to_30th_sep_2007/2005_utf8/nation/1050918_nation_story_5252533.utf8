 EC sniffs mischief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Election Commission today said it was dismayed by a campaign against it by politicians in Bihar to tarnish its image.

 In a press release that the commission released from Patna ? where chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon was on a visit to take stock of arrangements ? it said some politicians were making unwarranted and motivated statements intended to provoke people against the Election Commission.

 The commission did not identify the politicians and restricted its comments to a few political functionaries.

 The 81-day Assembly election process in Bihar announced by the commission envisages polling in four phases on October 18 and 26 and November 13 and 19. Counting is slated for November 22.

 The Election Commission has ordered unprecedented security arrangements for the elections, summoning the largest deployment of central paramilitary forces for a single state election, and has also requisitioned Indian Air Force helicopters.

 Despite promises from Union ministries for all help in conducting the polls, the commission is still not convinced that it has the resources for the hustings.

 The commission has issued the press release condemning the comments against it but at the same time said it was beneath its dignity to respond to those malicious and highly mischievous allegations made by certain politicians.

 Railway minister and RJD leader Laloo Prasad Yadav had recently said that the Election Commission was not above reproach in arranging for the polls. 

 He alleged that the commission was engineering the transfer of Muslim and lower caste/Dalit officials from Bihar before the polls.

 The chief election commissioner is understood to have dedicated most of his visit to reviewing arrangements in 10 districts of the Kosi, Darbhanga, Saran and Patna divisions where polling is to be held in the second and third phase of the elections.

 Tandon will lead a three-member Election Commission team to Bihar again on September 21 for a full review of the arrangements.

 Election commissioners N. Gopalaswami and Navin Chawla will accompany the chief election commissioner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 PC for all, at Rs 9990

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Aug. 1: Dayanidhi Marans quest for a PC for the masses ended today with HCL rolling out a computer that costs Rs 9,990 plus taxes.

 At its launch, the information and technology minister recalled how several months ago he had got IT big minds together, virtually locked them up in a room and tasked them with making a PC that cost less than Rs 10,000.

 Today is a very important moment in the history of Indian PC revolution with an Indian company giving a fully functional low-cost PC to our people, Maran said, giving away the first 15 of these PCs to 15 schoolchildren from his Central Madras constituency.

 I congratulate HCL for having come out with the right solution without compromising on quality, he said. Ajay Chowdhry, chairman and CEO of Noida-based HCL Infosystems Ltd., was present at the launch.

 Maran said he had personally checked out the PC, which has a 1 GHz processor, 128 MB RAM, 40 GB hard disk, a 15- inch digital colour monitor, before unveiling it. It supported word processors, spreadsheets and had facilities for running Tamil software and browsing the Net.

 It is good for a start and should take care of computing needs at home. More facilities can be added depending on individual requirements. 

 More important, the launch was in line with the national objectives set in the UPAs common minimum programme and the 10-point agenda I had outlined in the beginning of my term, he added.

 This included taking IT to the masses in an effort to bridge the digital divide.

 Maran said though computer penetration in India was now at 15 million with 5 million Internet connections, it was low compared to the population. The target was to increase it to 75 million by 2010 with 45 million Internet connections, he said.

 The new PC would not only speed up IT development, it would also make an impact in rural areas as the Centre was mulling an e-governance programme to set up one lakh common service centres by 2007, he said.

 HCL chairman Chowdhry said his company had worked on the PC for eight months or so and tested it in very rugged conditions, including the icy temperatures of Leh. In rural areas where power supply was erratic, a car battery could run it for up to eight hours, he said.

 The cue for the PC came from an IT task force report ?Roadmap to the Domestic IT Industry ? which detailed the governments objective to enhance penetration from 11 users per 1,000 people to 65 per 1,000 people by 2008, he said.

 The expectation of selling very high volumes in the domestic market encouraged us to look at low-cost PCs for the masses, he added.

 Mr Maran wanted us not to produce a cheap product but to address the bottom end of the PC market, comprising 800 million people whose monthly income was Rs 6,000 in India, with a high quality product. Rs 9,990 is a magical number we arrived at in pricing this low-cost PC.

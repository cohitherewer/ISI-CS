 Last act in rapper copycat murder

 AMIT ROY

 Eminem: Bad impact?

 London, Dec. 5: A 26-year-old Indian woman, who went with a Scottish Eminem lookalike rapper to his flat probably to have sex, was battered around her head with an iron baseball bat and stuffed half-naked into a suitcase where she took an hour to bleed to death.

 Christopher Duncan, 21, who on Friday pleaded guilty at an Old Bailey trial to the murder of Jagdip Najran, a final year law student at London Metropolitan University, is expected to be given the mandatory life sentence (25 years).

 Judge David Paget informed him on Friday: There will, of course, be a life sentence. It is just a case of finding justice in working out what is the right minimum term.

 Duncan had imitated controversial American rap singer Eminem to the extent of covering his body with the identical tattoos, including those of two naked ladies on his chest. He also dyed his hair blond to look more like Eminem.

 Jagdip, who had singing ambitions of her own, had first met Duncan at a bar only two weeks before her death. On the night of her killing on May 13 last year, she confided to a friend that her heart was aflutter at the prospect of seeing Duncan again, which she did at another karaoke bar in Bishopgate in the heart of the city of London.

 As the evening progressed, the defendant sang Eminem songs and also knew the dance routines, Jonathan Laidlaw, the prosecution counsel, told the Old Bailey.

 His behaviour was described as aggressive. He went over to a group of women and called one of them a bitch.

 Duncan, who had moved south from Glasgow with his family, was living in Bethnal Green in the East End of London, not far from where Jagdip herself lived. She and Duncan left the pub with their arms around each other, stopped over at another bar for a drink and then went to his flat. It was located in a centre for the homeless and was shared with his mother, a heroin addict, who usually stayed with her boyfriend.

 Jagdip had previously told her friend about Duncan.

 Laidlaw said: One of the tragic features of this case is the terrible misjudgement she made of him.

 Duncan was, in fact, a petty criminal said by doctors to have a personality disorder. Police later discovered various weapons and violent videos in his flat. He had mixed alcohol with ecstasy, LSD and cocaine on the night of the murder. 

 The court heard that the couple abandoned an attempt to have sex ? Jagdip admitted to Duncan that she had never done it before. 

 Duncan, who was in a dreamlike state, then thought he heard the sound of people coming for him, at which point he struck Jagdip with an iron baseball bat and stuffed her body in the foetal position into a suitcase.

 The attack caused massive brain injuries and multiple skull fractures but she took an hour to die. Duncans flat was covered in blood, as was his white tracksuit which was found in a neighbouring flat.

 Duncan fled to Blackpool, where he was arrested at the home of his aunt, Paula Gilmore. Laidlaw said Duncan had told his aunt that Jagdip was a very nice girl.

 He said the girl smiled at him before looking away. Duncan then struck her and put her in the suitcase as he could not bear to look at her. His motive for this unprovoked and brutal killing of a defenceless and vulnerable woman has not been established, said Laidlaw. There is no sensible explanation for what he did.

 Even Duncans defence counsel had little positive to say on behalf of her client.Wendy Joseph said Duncan had been singing Eminem songs at the pub and had shouted lyrics full of the most unpleasant sentiments across the floor.

 If there is anything monstrous in this defendant may I suggest that it may be something that has been created rather than something that was born? What happened was a culmination of what had been happening to him throughout his life. He was a murderer waiting to happen. Things in his life were falling apart, explained Joseph.

 The case does not end here. Duncan is to be questioned about the unsolved murder of Margaret Muller, 27, a student at the Slade School of Fine Art, who was stabbed 49 times as she jogged through Victoria Park, Tower Hamlets, on February 3, 2003.

 Duncans father has apparently made an odd remark that though his son had confessed to Jagdips murder, the police would be unable to pin that of Muller on him.

 Jagdips murder raises the difficult question of whether pop stars, idolised by millions of impressionable young people, ought to be restrained if their music appears to encourage violence or racism.

 In Eminems most famous song, Stan, the narrator ties up his girlfriend and bundles her into his car boot before driving into a river.

 Eminem has admitting writing and recording racist lyrics in his teens, after a taped rap denigrating black women was unearthed. The lyrics, written in 1988, suggested that black women are bad and white women are good.

 Eminem apologised for the lyrics, saying the tape was made out of anger, stupidity and frustration when I was a teenager. Id just broken up with my girlfriend, who was African-American, and I reacted like the angry, stupid kid I was. I hope people will take it for the foolishness that it was, not for what somebody is trying to make it into today.

 At the end of Duncans trial on Friday, detective chief inspector Tony Boxall observed: Duncan was an Eminem fan and believed himself to be a talented rapper. He also had several tattoos on his body similar to the singer.

 Jagdips family said in a statement: She was beautiful, ambitious and determined. She touched the hearts of people she met. We will never see her pretty, smiling face or give her a hug.

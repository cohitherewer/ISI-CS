The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Paswan?s rule of the game: first among equals

 MAHESH RANGARAJAN

 Pawar: Pitching the power

 I have no love for the chair in Patna. That could have been mine for the asking

 Ram Vilas Paswan may have publicly declared he is a candidate for chief minister of Bihar. But his name will only go forward if his party and the Congress secure a clear majority. 

 ?I have no love for the chair in Patna. That could have been mine for the asking,? he says. Ram Vilas Paswan?s game plan is clear. It is to emerge as the focal point of an alternative to the present ruling dispensation in Bihar. 

 In an interview with The Telegraph, he was at pains to set at rest any speculation about post-poll plans. Tired after a day?s campaigning that saw him publicly stake claim, he exuded confidence and was more than willing to look ahead. No party other than Congress figures on his list of post-poll allies. The ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal may be a partner in New Delhi. On his home turf, it is a force he wants to keep at arm?s length even after the polls. 

 There is no question of any relationship with either Laloo or the BJP. He goes so far as to assert: ?The RJD and the BJP feed on each other.? The former plays on minority fears of saffron, the latter has been a refuge for upper castes targeted by Laloo Prasad Yadav. 

 The Lok Janshakti Party leader promises a new deal for all. At the centre of his bold bid for a viable alternative is a new equation between Dalits , now 17 per cent of the truncated state, and Muslims who form an equal number. This equation will be built around a common need for an end to caste and communal violence.

 The competition with the RJD for minority loyalties is especially intense. Paswan stresses that the nature of minority affections for Laloo was a negative tide against a resurgent BJP. Now that the latter has ebbed and a host of issues related to the livelihood and dignity of most Muslims have come to the fore, his party stands to gain the most. 

 Paswan?s claims will only be put to the test when the ballot boxes are opened on February 27. What is clear is that for the first time in 15 years, there is a plural, secular alternative to the continuing rule of Laloo and Rabri Devi. 

 The Union minister is at pains to emphasise ?Sonia is our leader in the United Progressive Alliance?. That relationship has probably been strengthened with his willingness to withdraw his candidates in the 87 seats where Congress is in the race.

 It is also evident on the ground, where every van, cycle and tempo with the Lok Janshakti symbol, ?the bungalow? also has a Congress flag. Not to be omitted, there is the obligatory photo of the Congress president. 

 This is a stark contrast to the last state Assembly polls. Five years ago, Paswan?s party was a pre-poll ally of the ruling NDA but failed to dislodge an embattled and cornered RJD. His own view is that the turning point was the massacres in Gujarat. By parting company with power and getting the message to the ground, he posed a threat to Laloo Yadav?s hold on the religious minorities. So confident is the MP from Hajipur that he does not hesitate to take a swipe at his former socialist compatriots now in the Janata Dal (United). 

 He would never even conceive of taking support from the NDA. Perish the thought. As for the JD (U), he sees no serious prospect of a break with the BJP. ?George Fernandes is not only the President of his party. He is also convenor of the NDA.? 

 The break with the NDA makes electoral sense. It also fits with the emerging project of a new social alliance to under gird his choice of political bedfellows. 

 ?The backward Muslims have always been with me,? he claims, ?but in the last few months, the general mass has begun to shift to our camp.? His supporters brandish pamphlets in Urdu which detail the lack of attention to issues of jobs, the salaries of madarsa teachers and the encroachments on waqf lands by elements close to the chief minister. 

 What is more striking than the bid for minority support is the subtle bid to reach out to the upper castes. Paswan accuses Laloo of fuelling conflicts to retain his own vote base. His own support for Mandal was aimed at making opportunity equal and at giving the deprived a share of power. 

 He places on record his record of attending functions to commemorate the killing of Bhumihars by Naxalites as well as his public mourning of Dalit victims of the Ranbir Sena. There is little doubt that reaching out to the forward classes is essential if he is to rally the anti-Laloo constituency to his camp. 

 Bihar is in a state of flux. ?Everyone has broken out of the cages of the past 15 years,? he says, ?and change is imminent.? That may yet not be quite so easy. He has never fought as a Congress ally in a state Assembly poll. Nor did he make a mark in the 1998 Lok Sabha outside a few pockets. 

 Times do change. There is little doubt that Paswan has managed to capture the imagination even as the NDA flags. There is a spring in the step of Paswans party, which has made everyone reconsider the set patterns of the past. Even the ruling RJD is gearing for a tough fight.

 Congress seems set to be a party he will work closely with. ?The barrack mentality has been broken,? he says. He leaves you in no doubt who will hold the key to power once the dust settles.

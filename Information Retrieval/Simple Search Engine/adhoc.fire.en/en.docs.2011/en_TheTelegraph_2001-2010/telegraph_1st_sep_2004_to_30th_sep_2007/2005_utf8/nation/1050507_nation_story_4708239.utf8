 Shourie ready for Centaur probe

 New Delhi, May 6 (PTI): Under fire in Parliament and from the comptroller and auditor general on the sale of two Centaur hotels in Mumbai, former disinvestment minister Arun Shourie today said he was ready to face any inquiry that the Prime Minister or the finance minister may deem fit.

 ?Even though the CAG has taken a view contrary to the view of the government on technicality and procedure, I reiterate my offer to face any inquiry that the PM or FM may deem fit,? he said.

 The BJP leader said ?the interesting feature is that? the CAG report does not mention that ?the figure that was put out at some stage on valuation of Juhu Centaur at Rs 246 crore was mysteriously brought down to Rs 101 crore?.

 Shourie said the CAG report strains at technicalities and declined to take any query on whether the NDA governments privatisation policies were being targeted politically.

 Asked if the statement by finance minister P. Chidambaram in Parliament two days ago that Shourie was taking ?active interest? in this transaction had any political overtones, the former disinvestment minister said: ?I would not respond to that and that question can be asked to the government.?

 The BJP leader said the CAG report has two kinds of comments ? one set deals with technical issues and the second set ?betrays an attempt? to paste colour on the work that was done.

 On the CAGs comments that the ministry helped the bidder arrange finances, Shourie said ?the fact of the matter is that the bidder (Tulip Hospitalities) paid the full amount (Rs 153 crore). The judgement of the government proved to be correct.? Eight national and private banks had made their own judgements about the financial strength of the bidder on the basis of which they advanced money to him.

 ?I have explained earlier (that) we met the bankers who the bidder said were prepared to lend him because we did not take the bidder at his word,? Shourie said, clarifying why the disinvestment ministry had talked to the bankers.

 On giving extension to the bidder, which attracted adverse comments from the CAG, Shourie said had the extensions not been given, the bidder ? who bid more than 53 per cent of the reserve price of Rs 101 crore ? would have escaped and the government would have lost Rs 153 crore.

 On the CAGs observation that reserve price was fixed at the lower end of the band, he said the report itself stated the reasons for which the evaluation committee recommended the particular reserve price.

 ?Government found these reasons to be valid. Each of these judgements has to be made in a particular context and in particular circumstances,? he said.

 Shourie said the policy issue of one bidder was considered by the cabinet committee on disinvestment. It then decided that ?the process must proceed even if there is one bidder?.

 The former minister pointed out that the CAG report had noted there were up to 20 interested parties at the beginning but this figure had come down to a single bid in the final stages and said the decision of each bidder to continue or not was commercial.

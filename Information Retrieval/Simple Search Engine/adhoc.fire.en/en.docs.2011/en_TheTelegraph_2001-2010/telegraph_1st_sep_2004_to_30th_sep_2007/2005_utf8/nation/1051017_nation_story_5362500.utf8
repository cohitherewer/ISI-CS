 Iran mission to win Indias nuclear nod

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: To ensure that friend India does not vote on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolution against Tehran yet again, Iranian ambassador S.Z. Yaghoubi met foreign minister Natwar Singh yesterday.

 The crucial meeting of the IAEAs board of governors ? of which India is a member ? is due on November 25. It will decide Irans fate, and if negotiations fail the issue may be referred to the UN Security Council.

 Although more than a month is left for the meeting, the Iranians are not taking any chances this time and have started campaigning among different political sections in India to garner support for the controversial nuclear programme.

 A few days ago, Yaghoubi had met CPI leader D. Raja to explain Irans stand. The Left parties, particularly the CPI and the CPM, are opposed to Indias perceived shift towards the US-led western bloc at the expense of Iran.

 Yaghoubi met Singh for an hour to discuss bilateral relations, regional issues and international political and security matters.

 The foreign ministry statement issued this afternoon did not say whether the nuclear programme and the forthcoming meeting of the IAEA board of governors was discussed. But since the meeting took place at Yaghoubis insistence, it is not difficult to guess what the envoy wanted to convey to the minister.

 At the last meeting of the IAEA board of governors, India had voted in favour of the West-sponsored resolution against Iran. Delhi, however, said that because of its intervention, the European Unions Big Three ? Britain, Germany and France ? had agreed to water the resolution down. Instead of an immediate referral to the Security Council, the EU Three ? the main sponsors of the resolution ? had agreed to resolve the issue through negotiations at the IAEA level.

 But the UPA governments claim found few takers back home. Its decision to vote against Iran came under severe criticism from the Opposition as well as its coalition partners, particularly the Left, whose support is essential to the governments survival.

 Some weeks ago, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met Left leaders to explain why India had voted against Iran, but failed to convince them. The Left parties have threatened to launch a countrywide movement to bring about a course correction in Indias foreign policy. They want to make sure that Delhi does not abandon its independent foreign policy under American pressure.

 The best scenario for India would be Iran and the EU Three settling the issue through negotiations before the next meeting of the IAEA board of governors.

 Iran says that under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has every right to conduct its peaceful nuclear programme. But the US and other western countries fear that Tehran is pursuing a secret nuclear weapons programme.

 After staying away from negotiations, Iran has now expressed willingness to return to the talks table. 

 If the issue can be resolved between Iran and the EU Three, the IAEA meeting next month might be called off. For this, Iran has to show flexibility and stop its attempts to convince the outside world that it is not making a nuclear bomb.

 But if negotiations fail, the Indian government might find itself in a tough situation where it would have to explain to parties at home why it has to go along with the West.

 Buta in fix over IPS shuffle 

Governor runs to Delhi 

 OUR BUREAU

 Buta Singh: At Delhi door

 New Delhi/Patna, Aug. 1: Bihar governor Buta Singh today flew to Delhi following summons from the home minister even as back in Patna, the IAS Association met to express its solidarity with chief secretary G.S. Kang. 

 The stand-off between Buta Singh and Kang ? ironically, both of them are Sikhs ? over the transfer of 17 IPS officers in the state, threatens to singe the United Progressive Alliance in Bihar. 

 However, the governor called on Kang at his residence before taking the flight to Delhi. 

 While home minister Shivraj Patil defended the governors action in the Rajya Sabha, his explanation that all established procedures were followed cut no ice with the Opposition which demanded the recall of Buta Singh. 

 Dissolution of the Bihar House and the governments attempt to extend Presidents rule in the state came in for sharp criticism before the House passed the resolution to continue Presidents rule amidst a walkout by the NDA.

 Kang, who in a rare public outburst had spoken out against the manner in which the transfers were decided, had proceeded on long leave, refusing to work till the state is under Presidents rule. He is, however, being persuaded to re-join his duty even as the home secretary of the state, A.K. Biswas, has also proceeded on long leave. 

 The president of the Bihar IAS Association, R.S. Tiwari, told newsmen after the meeting that the association adopted a resolution today, requesting the governor to alter the background and circumstances that had forced Kang to go on leave. 

 Tiwari asserted that if the chief secretarys views are overruled, he is entitled to record his dissenting note. If the government or the governor chooses to ignore the noting, the chief secretary is bound to accept it. 

 But, he hinted, the established procedures were not followed in this case and the chief secretary was possibly given no opportunity to record his dissent.

 Kangs objection to the transfer of several district superintendents of police, including Ratan Sanjay of Siwan, is on record. 

 The adviser to the governor, Arun Pathak, a former Bihar chief secretary, is said to be instrumental in taking the decision on the transfer of the officers, which, it is believed, came as a huge relief for controversial Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin. 

 Sanjays successor, G.P. Sinha, however, has also proceeded on medical leave after his initial plea of being unable to join the new assignment was disallowed.

 All political parties, except the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, have described these and earlier transfers as part of a prolonged conspiracy to replace efficient and honest officials with those who are allegedly committed to Laloo Prasad Yadav before the elections.

 The controversy figured in the Rajya Sabha today where the Opposition questioned the whimsical bureaucratic reshuffle by Buta Singh. 

 While some observers feel the controversy may adversely affect the RJDs poll prospects, some state BJP leaders feel Laloo Yadav was remote-controlling a drama to stop transfer of officials close to him.

 Laloo Yadav, during the 15-year RJD rule had Mandalised bureaucracy in Bihar and quite a number of officials in key positions are beholden to him, said a state BJP leader.

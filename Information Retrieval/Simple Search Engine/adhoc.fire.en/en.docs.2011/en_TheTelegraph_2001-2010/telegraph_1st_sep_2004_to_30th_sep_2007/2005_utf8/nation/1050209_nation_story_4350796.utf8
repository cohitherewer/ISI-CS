 Arms come free with drugs

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI 

 Feb. 8: Marketing-savvy narcotics dealers active along the Indo-Myanmar border in Nagaland have come up with their own version of the ever-enticing freebie ? with every kg of opium, they are giving away a 9 mm pistol at no extra cost.

 One of the hubs for such clandestine drug deals is Moya village of Kiphire district, where a state government power project lies in disuse. Myanmarese nationals come to the village, which is less than 40 km from the international border, to barter wool, batteries and salt for tribal machetes, cheap Myanmarese rum and whiskey. 

 Drug dealers come regularly, too, and peddle kanni (opium) more openly than anyone can imagine. 

 The arms that they offer for free are generally those smuggled in by Myanmarese drug barons from China and Thailand for their own use. 

 Though the barter system is bringing prosperity to the villages, Moya village council chairman S. Kiusumew expressed concern over the sale of drugs on the sly and the offer of arms as freebies. He blamed the government?s apathy towards the border villages for the growth of the narcotics trade.

 A policeman, one of the few manning the rundown police outpost in the area, admitted to knowing about the offer of a free 9 mm pistol with a kg of opium. ?It is to cover the risk which the buyer takes,? he said. 

 Sources said these buyers were not the actual consumers. From the village, the opium finds its way to other parts of the country via Dimapur. In December last year, Dimapur police found a kg of pure heroin while randomly checking vehicles. ?The forensic report confirmed the heroin?s purity,? Dimapur superintendent of police Janardan Singh said.

 Singh said the drugs were being smuggled into Nagaland from Myanmar through a well-organised network spanning all the border districts. 

 Kiusumew said the peddlers prefer the Mimi route as they speak the same dialect ? Mokuri ? as the people on the Indian side and, therefore, face fewer problems. Inter-marriages across the border also make the passage of drugs easier.

 Mimi village is the last major habitation on the Indian side on way to the Myanmar border. 

 The drug lords send their men to Mimi via Tepero in Myanmar with the contraband. It is then sent to the rest of the country. 

 Kiusumew said neglect by the state government, lack of education and opportunity for employment had made matters worse with the youth taking recourse to methods that bring in easy money.

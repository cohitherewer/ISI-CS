 BJP clears air with seer

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Jayendra Saraswati

 Chennai, Nov. 19: The message was clear ? despite his oscillating fortunes, the BJP had not given up on Jayendra Saraswati.

 It was the first time that the Kanchi pontiff was sharing a platform with politicians since his arrest in a murder case last November.

 The acharya gave me the impression that we (in the BJP) have not been talking about him now as it used to be in the past. But I assure him that our attitude towards the pontiff remains unwaveringly the same, senior party leader and one of its all-India secretaries, Ela Ganesan, said at a function at the mutts branch premises in Chennai.

 Ganesan made it clear that his deep sense of anguish at the acharyas arrest remained the same. We do not have to keep repeating all that we had said in defence of the pontiff as one of the leaders of Hindu dharma, he said.

 The BJP leader said the Supreme Courts observations on various petitions by the acharya has fully vindicated his partys stand on the issue. Even on the latest petition that sought transfer of the case to a court outside Tamil Nadu, the apex court had virtually censored the state government.

 I have already said that more than the trial courts verdict, our faith in the Kanchi sankaracharya remains unshaken, Ganesan said to cheers from a few hundred devotees who had gathered to mark the formal launch of 108 days of kamyaartha homam (sacrifice) and daily Vedic recitations for world peace and prosperity.

 Even if only a few hundred people have gathered here today to pay obeisance to you, it is to demonstrate that we all stand by you despite your adverse circumstances and are not like the proverbial migratory birds which fly away when the lake turns dry, said Ganesan, who earlier welcomed the acharya with a garland of sunflowers.

 Alluding to the way the Jayalalithaa regime had taken on the seer, Ganesan said: Hinduism had met with several crises in the past and, at the end of the day, had overcome all of them. It is the continuation of that age-old tradition that we are witnessing here today.

 VHP functionary Gopalji offered a floral crown to the acharya and presented him a vel (spear), the weapon of Lord Karthikeya.

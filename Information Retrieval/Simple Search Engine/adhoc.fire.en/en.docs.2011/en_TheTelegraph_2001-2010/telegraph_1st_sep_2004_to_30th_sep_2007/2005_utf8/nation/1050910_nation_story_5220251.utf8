Mumbai, Sept. 9: Mumbai may not be able to shake off the memories of 26/7 in a hurry.

 The scare of the July 26 cloudburst briefly gripped the city this afternoon as heavy rain and high tide drowned low-lying areas in the western and central Mumbai suburbs, throwing traffic at the airport and on arterial roads out of gear and disrupting suburban trains.

 But the rainfall was nowhere near the 944.2 mm that marooned Mumbai in July. The Colaba observatory recorded 5.3 mm rain while Santa Cruz recorded 9.8 mm in the last 24 hours till 8.30 am today. High tide began at 9.31 am and ended at 2.51 pm.

 Traditional low-lying areas of Mahim, Bandra and Khar in the western suburbs, and Kurla, Sion, Parel and Worli in the central suburbs reported waterlogging between 11 and 2 pm. Train tracks at Sion and Kurla were submerged.

 Waterlogging at Mahim and Kherwadi choked the Western Express Highway and SV Road, forcing vehicles to crawl bumper to bumper. The tips of north and south Mumbai and neighbouring Thane did not report heavy rain.

 On July 26, south Mumbai had reported little rain when the downpour drowned suburban Mumbai, killing over 600 people.

 Not willing to take chances, Mumbai police and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation were quick to assure people there was no cause for panic. As a precautionary measure, the police issued a travel advisory asking people not to venture out if rain persisted.

 Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy said: This kind of waterlogging is normal during monsoon. There is no need to panic.

 BMC commissioner Johny Joseph told people the municipal authorities were in control of the situation. We have posted senior officials at various control rooms to take immediate steps like pumping the water out. 

 Central Railway chief public relations officer Sunil Jain said: Between 1.45 and 3.45 pm, we had to stop services but traffic resumed after 4 pm. Mumbai airport director Sudhir Kumar dismissed the panic as media created. 

 The showers did not dampen the Ganesh festival revelry.

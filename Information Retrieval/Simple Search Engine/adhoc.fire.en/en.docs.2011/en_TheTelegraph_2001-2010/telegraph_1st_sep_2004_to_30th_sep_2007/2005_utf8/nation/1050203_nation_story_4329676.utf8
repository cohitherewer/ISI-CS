 Alarm on TB comeback

 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: Tuberculosis in India has made a dramatic comeback in the last decade with the country now recording the highest number of TB cases in the world. 

 The fact that the country has over 5 million people infected with HIV/AIDS has made matters worse as they tend to easily contract TB due to their low immunity level.

 Officials say 40 per cent of the population or 400 million people are already infected with the TB bacteria. Although only 10 per cent of those infected will get TB, co-infection with HIV increases this risk to 60 per cent. 

 This has led health experts to seriously consider a combined approach to tackle the twin threat. The government is thinking of co-ordinating the two programmes and conducting joint training for educating HIV and TB health workers on both the diseases, health officials said.

 How has tuberculosis ? which was not heard of for a while in the sixties, seventies and the eighties ? suddenly resurfaced in such a big way? 

 M.M. Singh, vice-chairman of the TB Association of India, explains. ?TB was there all along. It?s just that cases were not diagnosed until the World Health Organisation and the Indian government conducted a countrywide survey in 1992 and found that the deadly disease was widespread in the country but was not either detected or reported.? 

 The statistics are startling. Annually an estimated 1.8 million new TB cases are registered and this constitutes one-fifth of the total new cases globally. New smear-positive cases, which confirm the presence of the TB bacteria, are a whopping 795,000 and estimated TB deaths are 417,000. Many of these deaths are also of people with AIDS who finally contract TB and die.

 Every day 20,000 people are infected in the country, of which more than 5,000 develop TB. More than 300,000 children leave school each year as their parents suffer from TB. More than 100,000 women with TB are rejected by their families. Some 1,000 people die everyday of the disease.

 Mayavati vents Taj ire on govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 12: Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayavati went on the offensive in the Rajya Sabha today with a bitter tirade against the CBI, which is investigating charges of corruption against her, and threatened to withdraw support to the UPA government.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sat silently, watching the action.

 The double standards of the CBI in investigating the Taj corridor case has evoked tremendous anger countrywide among all sections of Dalits and the oppressed, Mayavati told the House.

 The BSP leader launched her attack against the CBI and the Congress-led government as soon as the Rajya Sabha met this morning.

 The first hour of business in Parliament is always reserved for questions. But even a tough Bhairon Singh Shekhawat could not stop Mayavati, who said: I have a matter of grave importance to discuss.

 If the government does not change its policy and continues to set the casteist CBI on me, we will have to consider withdrawing support, Mayavati said. Her threat is an empty one because the BSP with its 19 MPs supports the Manmohan Singh government from outside. Even if she walks out, it will not affect the governments stability.

 She said the CBI was out to get her because of its innate prejudice against all Dalits.

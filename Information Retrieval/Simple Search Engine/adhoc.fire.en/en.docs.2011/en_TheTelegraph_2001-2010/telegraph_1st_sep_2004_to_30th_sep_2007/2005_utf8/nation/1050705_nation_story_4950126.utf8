 Afghan terror talk

 Afghan foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah (in AFP picture) has admitted that the recent attacks in his country by Taliban and al Qaida activists who had crossed over from Pakistan have posed a big challenge to the Kabul government. 

 Abdullah, on a two-day visit to India, met several leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, on Monday and warned Pakistan against imposing its agenda of extremism on Kabul.

 The Afghan leader said he is confident that the Taliban will not be able to alter the course the Afghan people have chosen since the fall of Saddam Husseins regime ? to join the international mainstream.

 Police makeover

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: A police constables job profile could soon change.

 At a meeting today on police administration, the parliamentary consultative committee of the home ministry was unanimous that major changes in the job of a constable, the pivot of the force, were needed because the image of the police largely depends on them, reports our special correspondent.

 The committee felt that constables, who till now have been performing their duty based on the Police Act of 1861 that required no judgement on their part, should do more skilled jobs.

 Rajya Sabha member P.C. Alexander set the tone, saying the 1861 law should be scrapped and called for better promotion avenues for constables. Lack of promotions was one of the main reasons frustration sets in, he said, adding that in many states constables do not get even a single promotion.

 The committee called for at least three promotions and a freeze on direct recruitment of head constables and assistant sub-inspectors so that these posts could be filled up by promoted constables. It also suggested that 50 per cent of the posts at the sub-inspector level should be filled up through promotions.

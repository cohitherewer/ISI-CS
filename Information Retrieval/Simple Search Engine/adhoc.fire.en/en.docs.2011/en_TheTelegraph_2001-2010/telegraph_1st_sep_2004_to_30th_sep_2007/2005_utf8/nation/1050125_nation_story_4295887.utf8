 Sin spots on tech underbelly

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

Hyderabad, Jan. 24: Vice-busters have stumbled 

on a farmhouse that hosted religious fairs during the day and rave parties by 

night near the city which once eased entertainment rules to court an army of infotech 

professionals.

 As many as 59 people, including 13 foreigners ? several of them students ? trooped out of the farmhouse in Sudarshan, 20 km from Hyderabad, after a raid yesterday. 

 They have been charged with indulging in indecent activities with the police claiming that 15 girls were roped in for ?obscene? dancing at the party. Ten of the foreigners, hailing from South Africa and Tibet, are staying in the city for higher studies.

 Police said the revellers, several of whom belong to affluent families, were sold tickets at a local pub for a ?thrilling evening? away from the city. The pub owner, who also doubles as a disc jockey, is among those arrested.

 Besides the promise of being entertained by the girls, the patrons were offered makeshift cottages, a bonfire, liquor and food. 

 ?The organiser used to hold religious melas during the day at the venue to camouflage the nocturnal operations,? a police officer said. 

 The police had launched a crackdown after women?s groups began a campaign against the liberal ?tourism policy? of the erstwhile Chandrababu Naidu government.

 Complaints have been burgeoning about the government?s policy to promote the entertainment industry ? considered an essential element in the city crawling with infotech professionals.

 Though well-intentioned, the policy was misused by some to sell sleaze in the guise of entertainment.

 The Congress government did not touch these operations initially, but pressure on the ground had forced legislators to demand a clampdown.

 A week ago, the police had raided another farmhouse near a well-known business school and arrested 21 boys and 10 girls. ?Most of them were students from the business school and other high-profile institutions,? a police officer said.

 The police said raids had been carried out on over 32 resorts. Around 2,310 people, including 300 sex workers, have been picked up. Nearly 1,200 of those arrested were teenagers or infotech professionals.

 As many as 61 farmhouse-cum-resorts have mushroomed around Hyderabad after the city was hardsold as an infotech destination. But not all fall back on sleaze for survival. ?We get almost 100 youths every day who come with girlfriends and family for entertainment,? an owner of a resort at Gatkesar, about 15 km from Hyderabad, said.

 Rebel death blow to cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 16: Investigators groping for clues to the Maoist jail raid suffered a setback as the lone Naxalite captured after the attack died today.

 Manoj Kanu, the self-styled sub-zonal commander of the CPI (Maoist), died this morning at Patna Medical College and Hospital. 

 Kanu was injured in a chance blast at the Jehanabad Police Lines and later brought to Patna for treatment. He was operated upon for intestinal perforation after a splinter pierced his body.

 But the identity of Manoj has come under suspicion. A source said he was actually Neeraj Paswan, a junior CPI (Maoist) worker.

 Police, however, said they consider the death a blow to the case. We were depending heavily on him to gather more clues to get to the bottom of the plot and his death is a setback to the probe, Patna senior superintendent of police Kundan Krishnan said.

 Kanu had earlier told journalists at the hospital that the Sunday night attack was meticulously planned two months ago and that Naxalites from Andhra Pradesh had participated in the operation.

 Jehanabad district magistrate Rana Awadhesh, in charge of the jail, said he did not have any prior information on the Naxalite attack. We did not have any such intelligence. I had visited the jail a few days back and could not smell any conspiracy being hatched, he said.

 The district magistrates statement could set the stage for a clash between IAS and IPS officers. IG (Patna) A.S. Nimbran had said that he had sent a report about a possible Naxalite attack to the government a few days ago.

 Policemen have protested against the suspension of the Jehanabad superintendent of police while no action has been taken against the district magistrate. This might soon become a full-blown IAS-versus-IPS controversy, a police officer said.

 No hostages

 The Maoists today claimed that it had no hostages. A pamphlet issued by the CPI (Maoist) said no one is being held captive and it was responsible for the murder of only two Ranbir Sena members, according to special IG S.K. Bharadwaj.

 Child charity rings holocaust alarm

 Bangkok, Aug. 22 (Reuters): From the garbage dumps of New Delhi to the tsunami-hit coastlines of Indonesia, nearly 600 million Asian children, or half its young population, are living in poverty, a leading child charity said today.

 What is happening here is catastrophic, said Michael Diamond, Asia director for Plan, an international development agency, at the launch of the Growing up in Asia report on child welfare in the region.

 Despite rapid economic growth in many countries, including the worlds most populous nations, China and India, many Asian children are being left behind and lack access to basics such as food, clean water, shelter, healthcare, education and sanitation.

 If nothing is done by rich and poor countries alike, the lost potential ? and lost lives ? could be one of the most tragic failings of modern times, Diamond said.

 We will be judged in future generations, the future centuries, when they write the history and compare us maybe to the holocaust, he said.

 Detailing poverty across the region, the report said around 350 million children ? nearly one in three of Asias youngsters ? were absolutely poor, meaning they do not have access to two or more of a childs basic necessities.

 Another 250 million or so had no access to one of the basics, making for a total of about 600 million poor children in the region.

 Outlining a strategy to spend $1 billion in 12 Asian countries in the next decade, the 68-year-old agency said it would try to give children a voice and change the attitudes of many societies towards their treatment of the under-18s.

 People say, Why do you have this problem? Is it lack of good governance? Is it corruption? Is it attitudes, cultures, customs, mores? The answer is its all of those, said Plan chief executive Tom Miller.

 We are talking about the next generation, about children who havent had a say in their lives to date, who have had adults taking their decisions for them, he said.

 Miller, a career US diplomat, also called on the worlds richest regions, in particular North America and Europe, to cut domestic agricultural subsidies to allow farmers in the worlds poorest countries to make more from their exports.

 Rich nations should also forgive third-world debt, the report said, although it said this must go hand in glove with improved levels of governance to ensure the most vulnerable feel the benefits in the form of improved health services and education.

 Plan programmes in Asia include providing loans to low-income families, treatment and health education to combat child killers such as malnutrition and malaria, as well as trying to give girls greater access to schooling.

 In Asia, Plan operates in India, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, East Timor, Vietnam and the Philippines.

 Sangh sets ideology goal for BJP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 23: The RSS today asked the BJP to return to the parents ideological moorings and expressed the hope that the party would reach the destination even if the pace is slow.

 At the end of the Sanghs national executive in Chitrakoot, senior RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat regretted that the BJP is delaying the return to the ideological core.

 But he was too strident in his criticism. A lot of things have happened and that is why the BJPs pace of return to the RSS ideology has been slow. But they will reach the destination even if the pace is slow, Bhagwat added.

 Without coming down hard on L.K. Advani, the RSS leader said he would discuss with the BJP president the remark that the Sangh is interfering in the functioning of the BJP.

 There may be various perceptions. We will discuss it with Advani. Only after that we will be able to tell you what is giving rise to this perception, Bhagwat said. He denied any tension between Advani and the Sangh. 

 The RSS leaders comments suggested that the Sangh will assert itself ? as it has done in the past in the case of Advani ? if it found the BJP straying from the ideological moorings. 

 It is our job to see they are on the right track. We have been busy. So have they been. We shall discuss the matter once things settle down, said Bhagwat.

 He also indicated that the Sangh would keep Advanis successor on a tight leash. The (BJP) president could not alone take decisions. The BJP is not a new party. It has a long history and we have our swayamsevaks there, Bhagwat said, asked what the Sanghs response would be if the next party chief does not have an RSS background.

 Pointed out that Advani was an old RSS hand, Bhagwat said: There could be other RSS men holding different views. If there is deviation, we will see what their view is. 

 Bhagwat was critical but cautious enough not to trigger another round of battle with a section of BJP leaders. Of late, both the Sangh and the BJP have been dogged by dissidence.

 They have grappled with Advanis remarks over Jinnah and the subsequent turmoil. Faced with a hostile RSS and resentful party colleagues, Advani was forced to announce in Chennai that he would step down as president in December. 

 Another round of feuding broke out when Uma Bharti spearheaded a revolt among the Madhya Pradesh MLAs. The campaign eventually pitted her against the RSS, prompting many to believe that she is fighting Advanis battle.

 She recently attacked a Sangh functionary, Suresh Soni, for interfering in the BJPs affairs in Madhya Pradesh.

 Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, who has fallen out with the Sangh, has also backed Advani and proved his vote-catching powers in the recent Ahmedabad municipal elections.

 Considering the adverse publicity generated by the series of skirmishes, the Sangh now wants the BJP to project a cohesive face.

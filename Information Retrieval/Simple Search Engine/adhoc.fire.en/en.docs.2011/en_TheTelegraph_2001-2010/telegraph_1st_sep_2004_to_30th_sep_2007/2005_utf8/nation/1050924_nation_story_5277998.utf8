 Surprise PoK shift by family

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Sept. 23: A family of seven sneaked across the Line of Control to settle in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir today, catching the army by surprise.

 This is the first time in the past four years that a family from a border village in Jammu and Kashmir has emigrated to the other side.

 Mohammad Hussain, 56, took his wife, two sons, two daughters and a daughter-in-law ? as well as his cattle? across without being detected. The army learnt about it from Hussains fellow villagers in Dehri, which is less than 500m from the LoC.

 Border villagers are allowed to go up to the line, so Hussain and his family were not questioned. Then they must have just walked across unchallenged.

 Villagers on either side frequently cross over to visit relatives. But todays incident was unique and surprising, army sources said.

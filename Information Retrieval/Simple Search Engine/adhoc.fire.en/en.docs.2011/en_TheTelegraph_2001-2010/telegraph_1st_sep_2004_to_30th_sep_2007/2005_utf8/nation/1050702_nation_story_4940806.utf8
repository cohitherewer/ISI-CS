Madurai, July 1: The 150-year-old dream of a shipping route linking the Palk Strait to the Bay of Bengal will begin to take shape tomorrow at a site where wishes are supposed to come true.

 Mythology says the Lord opens up ways around obstacles at Vandiyur. Here, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will inaugurate the Rs 2,427-crore Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project, which will dredge a direct route between the Indian east and west coasts, removing the need for a detour around Sri Lanka.

 The narrow strip of water between the two countries is too shallow for ships to navigate. India plans to build two deep channels by dredging the seabed, one across Adams Bridge (the chain of islets and shallows linking India and Sri Lanka southeast of Pamban Island) and the other through the shallows of the Palk Bay.

 The 167-km channel, dubbed Suez of the east, will shorten the shipping route by up to 424 nautical miles (780 km) and cut sailing time by some 30 hours, saving fuel, said N.K. Raghupathy, chief of the Tuticorin Port Trust, the nodal agency for the project.

 The countrys import-export trade will be saving the Rs 1,000 crore a year it now spends in foreign exchange owing to transhipment of cargo outside the country, through Colombo.

 The previous time the earth was dug up on a major scale at Vandiyur was 360 years ago, to give shape to the Madurai rulers long-held dream of building a palace.

 King Thirumalai Nayaks project had run into many difficulties for years when, one day in 1645, his diggers unearthed a seven-foot idol of Lord Ganesh, sculpted out of a single piece of granite. As he installed the idol at the Meenakshi Amman temple, his problems vanished and he was able to erect the mansion he wanted. The idol is still worshipped. 

 The UPA at the Centre, especially the DMK and the Congress in Tamil Nadu, will also be hoping the hurdles to the current project will go away soon.

 Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa will boycott tomorrows function on the ground that fishermens and environmentalists concerns have not been fully addressed. 

 Local fishermen, who fear the project will hit their livelihood, have declared Saturday a black day and plan to wave black flags before the guests, including Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi.

 Legal tangles have cropped up, too, with Madras High Court yesterday allowing an NGO, Coastal Action Network, to place its objections before the National Environmental Appellate Authority.

 Union shipping minister T.R. Baalu today tried to play down the problems, saying all environmental issues have been addressed and international maritime norms followed.

 Left patch-up awaits Sonia return

 Manmohan Singh

 New Delhi, June 27: Sonia Gandhi will soon invite Left leaders for a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to address their objections to the divestment of Bhel, one of the so-called public sector navratnas.

 Congress general secretary Ambika Soni said Singh spoke to Sonia, who is holidaying in Himachal Pradesh, after the Left parties conveyed their decision to stay away from the committee, formed with leaders of the two sides, in protest against the divestment decision.

 The Prime Minister later spoke to CPM general secretary Prakash Karat. He told the Left leader that he had gone through the letter the four Left parties wrote to Sonia yesterday, saying they had decided to suspend their participation in the committee.

 Singh ? to whom a copy of the letter was sent ? is understood to have told Karat that he looked forward to a meeting with the Left leaders after Sonia, the chairperson of the central coalition, returns from Himachal.

 CPM leaders said Karat wanted to know if the government would consider reversing its decision to sell 10 per cent of its equity in Bhel in the market. Singh, however, offered to discuss all issues at the meeting Sonia would convene.

 Apart from the Prime Ministers talks with Karat, Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel also got in touch with Karat and CPI national secretary D. Raja.

 The Congress is keen to sort out the differences with the Left. But there is no panic though DMK chief M. Karunanidhi also conveyed to Congress leaders that the government should adhere to the alliances common minimum programme.

 The CMP commits the government to not privatising the public sector navratnas, but does not bar divestment.

 Sonia, sources said, is unlikely to cut short her four-day vacation and might return to the capital either on June 29 or 30. In any case, the sources pointed out, an immediate meeting with Left leaders would not be possible as Karat has left on a two-day visit to Andhra Pradesh and CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan is away in Jharkhand.

 Soni expressed confidence that the differences with the Left over some economic policy issues would be sorted out. There is no problem which cannot be resolved, the Congress general secretary said. But she avoided a direct reply when asked if the government would reverse the Bhel decision to bring the Left back on the co-ordination panel.

 Party spokesperson Jayanti Natarajan, however, sought to counter the Lefts charge that the divestment move violated the CMP. 

 The government has committed no breach of the CMP, she said, asked if the Congress would ask the government to retract its Bhel decision if it is found to be contrary to the CMP commitments.

 About Karunanidhis call to the Congress leadership, both Soni and Natarajan maintained that all UPA constituents stood by the CMP commitments.

 Other allies like the Nationalist Congress Party are also expected to express support for the Left as copies of Sundays letter were also sent to them today. NCP spokesperson D.P. Tripathi underlined the need for effective consultations.

 and hoped that the leading UPA constituent would take steps to ensure smooth functioning of the coalition.

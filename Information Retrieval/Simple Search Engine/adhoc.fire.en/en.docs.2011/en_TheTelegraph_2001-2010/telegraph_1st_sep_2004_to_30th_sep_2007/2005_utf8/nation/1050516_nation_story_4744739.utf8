 Shoaib

 Islamabad, May 15 (PTI): Pakistani speedster Shoaib Akhtar has rejected an offer from Indian filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt, saying his first love was cricket and his fans wanted to see him as a cricket star, not a movie star.

 I love cricket and want to concentrate on it. I have absolutely no intention of featuring in films, he was quoted by a local daily as saying.

 It (report of him acting in a film) is absolutely rubbish. I have nothing to do with films. I want to fully concentrate on my cricket which is my bread and butter, he said. Shoaib is, however, scheduled to meet Bhatt tomorrow.

 The Rawalpindi Express, dropped for Pakistans tour of the West Indies reportedly on grounds of fitness, said all cricketers got offers to act in films and he has been receiving them for the last six years.

 For the last six years I have been getting such offers and so do players like Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik, he said.

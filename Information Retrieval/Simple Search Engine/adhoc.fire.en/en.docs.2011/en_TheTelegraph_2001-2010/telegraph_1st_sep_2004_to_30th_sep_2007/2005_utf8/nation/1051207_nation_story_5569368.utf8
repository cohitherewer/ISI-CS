 Rape charge in crowded compartment

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 6: A 20-year-old woman was allegedly raped on the Mumbai-bound Pawan Express by a ticketless passenger last night.

 Railway police said the incident happened in a reserved compartment of the train ? which comes from Darbhanga in Bihar ? between 12.30 am and 2 am as it crossed Nashik Road junction and neared Igatpuri station.

 The victim is a 20-year-old married woman from Madhya Pradesh, who was travelling to Mumbai with her husband. After she raised an alarm, the passengers nabbed the accused, Prakash Jadhav, said inspector-general of police, (railways), Ramrao Wagh.

 The accused was part of a group travelling to Mumbai to pay homage to Babasaheb Ambedkar on his death anniversary today and boarded the train at Nashik Road, he said. 

 Wagh added that the husband was sleeping next to her and the compartment was crowded when the incident took place in the S3 bogie. The group also indulged in looting. Jolted out of sleep by the womans screams, the passengers chased the group. Jadhavs brother Pramod escaped along with four others.

 Although the woman informed Igatpuri railway police, action was taken only after the train reached Kalyan on the outskirts of Mumbai. 

 Besides Jadhav, eight others have been arrested on charges of robbery.

 The accused and the victim were sent for a medical test to Rukminibai Hospital in Kalyan.

 Since Igatpuri falls in the jurisdiction of Nashik Road railway police, the accused and the victim were sent to Nashik where a case has been lodged, said Ashok Worlikar, senior inspector of Kalyan railway police station.

 Wagh said: The rapist belonged to the group of looters. A small knife was recovered from them. Initial reports indicate that they were petty thieves from the Satpura area of Nashik. 

 The IG also confirmed the reports of looting in S7 and S8 coaches of the Pawan Express and other long-distance trains like the Vidarbha Express by other groups travelling to Mumbai for Ambedkars death anniversary. 

 Seven persons have been arrested on charges of looting aboard the Vidarbha Express.

 Railway police have formed a special squad to probe the rape and the robberies.

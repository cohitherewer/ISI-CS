 BSF trio killed in tiff

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, May 2: A Border Security Force jawan gunned down two of his colleagues and shot himself this afternoon apparently after an argument over the arrest of a 14-year-old boy smuggling salt to Bangladesh.

 Murshidabad superintendent of police Sanjay Singh said constable R.K. Sharma fired twice at A.B. Momen and Priyaranjan Giri from his self-loading rifle. 

 ?The bullets hit them on the chest and they were killed on the spot. Sharma shot himself in the head with the same rifle. We have started a case. We will hand over the three bodies to the BSF authorities after post-mortem tomorrow,? Singh added. The three were on duty at the Ramnagar border outpost in Lalgola, about 260 km from Calcutta. Sharma apparently spotted the boy trying to sneak into Bangladesh with a sack full of salt on his head. He detained him.

 The police said he dragged the boy to the outpost and began beating him. Hearing the scream, Momen and Giri rushed in and asked Sharma to release him. When he refused to do so, an altercation ensued. 

 Police officers who spoke to villagers who witnessed the incident said Sharma threatened to shoot his colleagues in a fit of rage and they dared him to open fire.

 ?Suddenly, Sharma picked up his rifle and fired upon his colleagues. The bullets pierced them and flew out. They slumped on the ground,? an officer quoted a villager as saying. 

 ?As his colleagues lay dead, Sharma stared at them. Then, all of a sudden, he aimed the rifle at his head and pulled the trigger. He died instantly,? the officer added. BSF inspector-general R.K. Pachnanda has rushed two of his deputies to Lalgola for an inquiry. 

 He said: ?The real reason behind the incident is not yet known. Two DIGs have been sent to the spot to conduct an investigation. Receiving their report, I will be able to make out the real reason?. All I can say now is that we are not ruling out any possibility at this stage.?

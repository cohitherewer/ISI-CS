 Stench-free train trips just a patent away

 Ranchi, Sept. 14: If a 12-year-old from a small town can solve the problem of filthy tracks at railway stations, Indian Institute of Science graduates can surely do better.

 Pallavi Swaranjali and Priyanka Pundhir promise to keep all railway tracks across the country clean and train toilets free of filth, germs and stench.

 The waste-disposal system they have developed, Swachh (clean), will provide relief not only to railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav ? put off his food for 12 hours by a trip to a train toilet ? but also to the millions who travel by train every day.

 Ranchi girl Pallavi and Delhiite Priyanka, who did their masters this year at the premier science institute in Bangalore, have invented a small device that can be fitted inside the train toilet.

 It will act on the solid stools and change them into a compound that is completely free of germs and stench and even looks different. 

 The liquid waste will be treated and recycled for use in flushing the toilet.

 A prototype of the system, developed at about Rs 50,000, is being tested and the results have been very encouraging. The device has been designed to sustain waste management for long journeys (48 hours and more), typical in India.

 The odourless, clean by-product will not be released into the tracks even outside the stations. The system will also reduce the manpower engaged in cleaning train toilets and the tracks.

 Earlier this month, K. Masha Nazeem, a class VIII student from Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu, had hit the headlines by inventing a device to keep station tracks free of stools. 

 Her system allows a train driver to switch off the discharge of waste from toilets when a train enters a station and switch it on again as it leaves the platform. 

 The railways Integral Coach Factory has accepted her technique and is fitting out toilets with the device.

 The IISc is already in the process of patenting the system developed by Pallavi and Priyanka.

 We did a lot of research. We found out what kind of toilets are used by the railways of developed countries, such as the US, the European nations and the rest of the world, Priyanka said. 

 Everywhere, the solid waste is stored in trains as in planes and disposed of later at fixed places; so we wanted to do something different. 

 We examined all US patents office records since 1970 to ensure that our project was not a copy of any system that has already been patented. 

 The duo were guided by professors B. Gurumoorthy and Amaresh Chakrabarti of the institutes Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing.

 Since both of us studied architecture, we couldnt have done the mechanical part by ourselves, Priyanka said. 

 But we were lucky to be a part of IISc, which is full of technical experts. They were all very supportive. We took the help of professors from five or six departments. It was a team effort.

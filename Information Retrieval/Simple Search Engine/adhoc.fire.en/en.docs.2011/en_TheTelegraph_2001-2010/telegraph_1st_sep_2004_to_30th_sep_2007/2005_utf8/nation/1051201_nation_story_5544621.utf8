 College quota clash looms

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: The Centre is fast-tracking a law for reservation in private colleges, setting up a possible clash with the Supreme Court which again ruled against state quotas in such institutions today.

 The bill is likely to be introduced in the first or second week of December. Even if passed by Parliament, it could be challenged in court and, if found bad in the light of constitutional provisions, would be liable to be struck down.

 The apex court had passed a verdict in August saying the Centre and state governments could not enforce any quota or percentage of admissions? in a minority or non-minority unaided educational institution, such as a private medical or engineering college.

 Today, a seven-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal rejected Tamil Nadus plea for a review of the judgment. It said: We have carefully gone through the review petition. No case is made out for the review.

 The Union human resource development ministry, however, has finalised a draft bill allowing government quotas in private, unaided educational institutions. The Centre has already circulated a note seeking comments from these institutions.

 An all-party meeting had given the ministry the go-ahead to move towards enacting such a law.

 The law will be brought under two crucial provisions of the Constitution ? Articles 15 and 46 ? which say that (the) state shall not discriminate on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, etc and provide for promotion of educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections.

 The constitutional concept of reservation is based on the principle that there cannot be equality amongst non-equals and that till such time that non-equals become equals? they should be given reserved seats in educational institutions.

 The moot point is whether the constitutional obligation relates to reservation only in government institutions or also in private colleges. A point to note is that job reservation cannot be imposed on the private sector.

 The August judgment left many other questions unanswered, too.

 For instance, minority institutions are allowed to admit students of their choice, including non-minority students and those from other states. The question is, who would regulate this ? the states from where the students come or the state in which the institution functions?

 Similarly, though the judgment says institutions can have their own fee structure, it bans capitation fees and profiteering. It says a committee should regulate this fee structure. 

 What it doesnt make clear is how and by whom the committee should be formed ? and, if it is formed by the state, whether the private institutions will have a say in the process.

 The judgment also says: Unaided minority and non-minority institutions have unfettered fundamental right to choose the students. However, such admissions (will) be regulated by a centralised and single-window procedure.

 The question is, who will formulate the single-window procedure ? the state or the private institution itself?

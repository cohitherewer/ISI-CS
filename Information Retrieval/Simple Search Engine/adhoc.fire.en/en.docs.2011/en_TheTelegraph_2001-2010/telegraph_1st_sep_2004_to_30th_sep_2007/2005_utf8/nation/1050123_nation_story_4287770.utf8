 Parties promise ?heaven? in Bihar

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Jan. 22: If voted to power, the Congress will improve Bihar?s law and order within 24 hours, the BJP will order a probe into the assets of all Rashtriya Janata Dal ministers and the Lok Janshakti Party will establish a mental asylum in the state.

 These and many other promises ? including promoting Bihar sweets on the lines of Bikaner bhujia ? were made in the manifestos of the three parties released today. 

 The ruling RJD and the Janata Dal (United) have already issued their poll charters with vows to turn Bihar into heaven in five years.

 The BJP and the Congress stressed the need to declare Bihar a ?special? state with ?special? packages. But during its six-year rule at the Centre, the Vajpayee government had cited ?legal? hurdles in granting the special status. The Congress, now ruling in Delhi, has not talked about the package so far.

 Ram Vilas Paswan?s LJP launched a scathing attack on Laloo Prasad Yadav?s RJD, saying it has forced a ?corrupt, inefficient and anti-people? government on the people in its 15 years of ?anarchic misrule?. 

 The Congress said it is aiming to be a ?significant player? in the next government and that is how it will build pressure for a better Bihar. The party promised a central university and an Indian Institute of Technology along with special science research centres in every university. ?All irrigation schemes will be completed in three to four years. A chain of cold storages will be built. Tourism will be developed on a global scale,? state unit chief Ram Jatan Sinha said. 

 BJP state vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi promised creation of police commissionaires in Patna, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur and Darbhanga to ?control crime?. ?We will also bust the syndicates of politicians and gangsters and introduce a law on the lines of Maharashtra for dealing with crime. Doctors who do not attend duty will be dismissed within a month,? Modi said.

 The BJP said it would take a cue from Madhya Pradesh and provide a free milch cow to every poor farmer, besides guaranteeing 120 days of annual employment to every person. ?Special sweets of Bihar will be promoted on the lines of Bikaner bhujia,? the manifesto promised.

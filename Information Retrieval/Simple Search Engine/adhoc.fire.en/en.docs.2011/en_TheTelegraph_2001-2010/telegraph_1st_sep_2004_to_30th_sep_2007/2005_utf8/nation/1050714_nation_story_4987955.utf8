 Jaya outlaws united Maoists

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, July 13: The Jayalalithaa government has banned the Communist Party of India (Maoist) nearly 10 months after the Peoples War and the Maoist Communist Centre merged to form the unified Naxalite outfit.

 An official statement today said the Tamil Nadu government has declared the outfit an unlawful association under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908, as it could disrupt public peace in the state.

 Last September, Jayalalithaa had banned the Peoples War under the same act before its merger with the MCC, which has been active in states like Bihar and Jharkhand. 

 That ban also cited the central governments move to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act as an important reason for proscribing the Peoples War.

 The order banning the larger merged entity was issued yesterday, the statement said. The decision followed a review of the CPI (Maoist)s recent activities in Tamil Nadu. 

 The outfit, the statement added, was maintaining links with other banned extremist groups and circulating seditious slogans asking people to take to the path of violence.

 Apart from circulating seditious literature, the CPI (Maoist) was also found to be interfering with the maintenance of law and order in the state. Of late, it has been encouraging its members to use criminal force and violence against the government machinery and calling for a violent struggle, the statement said.

 Their posters, it added, have appeared in several districts, including Madurai, Thiruvallur and Dharmapuri. Wall posters announcing the merger of the two erstwhile Naxalite outfits have also appeared in Vellore district, the government said.

 In the light of these developments, the government said, it has assessed that the cadre of the merged organisation could indulge in activities prejudicial to public peace.

 The decision to ban the CPI (Maoist) has also come in the wake of reports that the LTTE was training suicide squads for the Naxalite outfit.

 Although the Union government has banned the CPI (Maoist) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act, 2004, the Jayalalithaa regime today urged the Centre to include the outfit in the list of terrorist organisations under the same act.

 CrPC stalemate

 The chief minister today told a delegation from various lawyers bodies that her government would immediately bring forth an ordinance to nullify the recent amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

 Lawyers across the state have been staying away from courts for the past one week in protest against the recent amendments, which, they said, were not in peoples interest.

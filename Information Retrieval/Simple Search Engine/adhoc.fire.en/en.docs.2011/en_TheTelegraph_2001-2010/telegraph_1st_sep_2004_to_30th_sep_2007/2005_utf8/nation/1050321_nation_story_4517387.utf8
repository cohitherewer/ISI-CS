 Convener of the joint struggle committee of PMC and PWB, Chandrika Prasad Bhakt, held a meeting late last night and announced to launch the strike from midnight on Sunday. The strike will continue till the administration provides a compensation of Rs 5 lakh and a job each to the families of those killed.

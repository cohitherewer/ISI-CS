 Mumbai, May 12: A metropolitan court today rejected Salman Khans application seeking exemption from personal appearance during the ongoing trial in a hit-and-run case.

 The actor has been charged with mowing down one bakery worker and injuring four in Bandra in September 2002.

 Salman, who is finishing his first Hollywood production Marigold, made an appearance before the Bandra metropolitan court today.

 Lawyer Dipesh Mehta requested the court to permit his client to remain absent during the trial to meet his professional commitments. The actor assured the court that Mehta would represent him.

 If Salman has to be present in the court, it creates inconvenience to producers and co-actors. He has to leave his shooting and spend the day in the court. Besides, it also puts pressure on police who have to make necessary arrangements for his security each time. It causes inconvenience to the general public and the police force can be used for more important things.

 ?But the court eventually said he has to be present in court during hearings, Mehta said.

 Salman has finished shooting for No Entry and Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya and is busy with Marigold, in which he plays a Bollywood choreographer in love with a London-based actress, who comes to India to pursue her dreams. 

 The application was a general application for exemption. It wasnt specifically about Marigold. The film is being shot primarily in India on locations in Rajasthan, Goa and Mumbai, the lawyer said.

 Sources, however, pointed out that Salman would have to travel to London for a few sequences.

 The court also issued a bailable warrant against constable Ravindra Patil, a key witness in the hit-and-run case, and directed him to be present before the court on May 26. Patil was travelling with Salman during the accident.

 The actor was arrested the same day under Sections 304-A (causing death by negligence), 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt), 338 (causing grievous injury) and 427 (causing damage by mischief) of the IPC. He was also charged with violations of the Motor Vehicles Act and the Bombay Prohibition Act.

 Following public outcry, the police later charged him with Section 304 Part II for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. However, after Salman challenged its application in Bombay High Court, the charge was dropped on the courts orders.

 The high court also sent the case to a lower court, which framed 10 charges against him in October 2003. Salman has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

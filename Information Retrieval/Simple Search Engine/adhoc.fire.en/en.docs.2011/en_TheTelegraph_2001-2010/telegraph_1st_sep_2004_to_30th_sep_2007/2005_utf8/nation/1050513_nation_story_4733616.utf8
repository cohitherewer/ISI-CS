 Paswan ready, RJD is not 

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, May 12: Accompanied by 21 of his 29 MLAs, Ram Vilas Paswan today called on Sonia Gandhi to say he is no longer averse to taking the Rashtriya Janata Dals support for a Congress-led government in Bihar headed by a Muslim.

 Even as the Lok Janshakti Party leaders new stand triggered a rash of interpretations about his motive, the RJD trashed the offer, saying it was the Congress that was playing a game through Paswan.

 Before meeting Sonia, Paswan said he was ready to reconsider his stand regarding the RJD if the Congress proposed a Muslim chief minister. His logic: The United Front government in 1996 was headed by H.D. Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal which had 56 MPs. The Congress, with 123 MPs, supported the government from outside, he added.

 As the Congress had made a sacrifice in the cause of secularism by making Deve Gowda and then I.K. Gujral Prime Ministers, others should also (make a) sacrifice in favour of the Congress for a secular government in Bihar, the Union minister said.

 He said the 75 RJD MLAs could back a government headed by the Congress, which has only 10 MLAs in a 243-member Assembly.

 Raghunath Jha, a senior RJD leader and a former Bihar minister, ridiculed the suggestion. We are ready, he said, provided the Congress and the LJP support an RJD Prime Minister in Delhi.

 The Congress appeared cool to Paswans proposal. Asked if the party would consider Paswans proposal, AICC general secretary Ambika Soni said the Congress stood by its commitment to supporting an RJD-led government. We have given in writing our support to the RJD in government formation, she said.

 After meeting Sonia, Paswan said the Congress chief listened patiently and told him she would consider the proposal.

 Sources in the United Progressive Alliance said Paswan is under pressure from his legislators to somehow form a government as they fear that the state might be heading for fresh elections after Presidents rule ends in September.

 Even if there are no takers for his proposal, Paswan could make it an election plank that Laloo Prasad Yadav did not support a Muslim candidate as chief minister and wean away the RJDs Muslim supporters.

 Paswan said he has taken the new stand to expose those who have exploited Muslims as a vote-bank and used the secularism card to remain in power. 

 Paswan alleged that interested parties were planting stories in the media that his party is on the verge of a split. They are day-dreaming, it would never happen. All my MLAs are solidly behind me, he said.

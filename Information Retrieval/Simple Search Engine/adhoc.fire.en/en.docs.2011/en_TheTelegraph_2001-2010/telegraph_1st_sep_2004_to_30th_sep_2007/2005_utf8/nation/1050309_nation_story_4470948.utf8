 GNLF piles strike heat on Buddha 

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Darjeeling, March 8: The GNLF today threatened a string of strikes if the government did not bow to its demands on the hill council, casting a shadow on the resurgent economy of the region.

 The list of strikes, which adds up to 91 days till June, is slated to begin with a three-day bandh on March 16. 

 Deepak Gurung, the president, Darjeeling GNLF branch committee, said today that if the demands raised by the party were not met, the party would go ahead with its ?scheduled? strikes.

 The threat comes before the meeting of the GNLF?s central committee on March 12.

 ?If the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government does not send the right signals even after the three-day strike, we will call a five-day strike from March 26, followed by 13 days of strike from April 9,? Gurung said.

 The GNLF has also threatened to call a strike for 21 days in May and follow it up followed with a 51-day mega bandh in June. The ominous call has exceeded the strike record set by the GNLF 15 years ago. In 1988, the party had brought the hills to a standstill with a 40-day bandh.

 The threat, to make the government concede to its demand for an ?alternative? to the DGHC and the nomination of Ghisingh as the caretaker of the council, once its term expires on March 26, has come as a blow to businessmen, especially tour operators and hotel owners. Moreover, the secretaries and councillors of the DGHC have piled pressure on the government by threatening to resign if Ghisingh is not made caretaker. 

 ?We appeal to all political parties to refrain from calling a bandh during the tourist season as tourism is one of the major industries in the hills,? said Suresh Periwal, the representative of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (north Bengal and Sikkim chapter).

 The booking patterns indicate that Darjeeling is set for a 25 per cent increase in foreign clients this year, he said. Around 35,000 foreign visitors are expected to visit Darjeeling while the number of domestic tourists is pegged at 4 lakh. The strike could also severely affect the industry in Sikkim as they are closely interrelated.

 ?Tourism is definitely a very sensitive industry and a mere threat will trigger cancellations. We appeal to the GNLF to restrain from calling the strikes. That should be the last resort,? said Pradip Tamang, secretary, Darjeeling Association of Travel Agents.

 Tourism had only recently begun showing signs of resurgence after the industry fell into the doldrums during the Gorkhaland movement.

 Though the business community remained guarded in its reaction, members said they were not in favour of bandhs. The move might boomerang on Ghisingh, some of them observed. 

 ?We will convene a coordination committee meeting if we get an official letter from the party to discuss the issue,? said J.K. Sharma, secretary of the Darjeeling Chamber of Commerce.

 The strike threat has virtually pushed the state government to the corner and, given the GNLF?s track record, Ghisingh would not shy from carrying out his threats.

 The Opposition parties today launched a vitriolic attack on Ghisingh and said it was time for the people to ?overthrow such leaders?. 

 ?His (Ghisingh?s) threat shows he is power hungry and that is why he wants to remain a caretaker. The government will not make him a caretaker as there is no provision to do so,? said Madan Tamang, chairman, People?s Democratic Front.

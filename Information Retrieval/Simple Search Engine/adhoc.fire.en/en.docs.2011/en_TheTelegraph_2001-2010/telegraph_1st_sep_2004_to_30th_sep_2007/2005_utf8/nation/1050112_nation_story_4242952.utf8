 BJP cry for Jaya scalp

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Jan. 11: The BJP today demanded the dismissal of the Tamil Nadu government over the arrest of the two Kanchi acharyas and accused the Centre of conniving with chief minister Jayalalithaa.

 A high-level meeting that BJP chief L.K. Advani convened this evening decided that the party would hold protest rallies across the country from January 15-22.

 Sources said Jayendra Saraswati, who was out on bail today, was being persuaded to visit his ?mutt? in Delhi. The BJP, they added, would use the occasion to organise a public meeting in his ?honour?.

 Though not officially stated, the party will raise the issue in the coming Assembly elections in Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana and harp on the Congress? ?inability? to spell out its stand, the sources said,

 Senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, tasked by Advani to fine-tune the Kanchi protest strategy, told the media that the Tamil Nadu government has a ?biased and prejudiced attitude? and works with a ?feeling of vendetta?.

 Congress sources said that if cornered by the BJP, they would publicise the ?fact? that the Kanchi mutt had on January 1 sent identical letters to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and leader of the Opposition Advani.

 The letter, the sources said, expressed the mutt?s apprehension that Tamil Nadu police would arrest the junior seer, Vijayendra Saraswati, if his superior was granted bail by the Supreme Court.

 The Prime Minister, the sources claimed, was quick to respond to the ?mutt?s? petition by writing to Jayalalithaa on January 6 about its fears of a second arrest.

 Singh wrote that the absence of both acharyas would mean disruption of the daily puja at the mutt and this would ?hurt the sentiment? of the devotees. He advised the chief minister to consider this aspect but stressed that the law must take its course.

 The Congress sources demanded to know ?why did Advani keep mum after receiving the letter??

 The BJP, however, dared the Centre to sack the state government and order a CBI inquiry into the arrests. ?There is obviously central connivance in this affair,? claimed party vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.

 The Congress reacted cautiously. ?The matter is before the court. We are not for any interference with the law taking its course. But we want the religious sentiments of the people to be respected,? party spokesperson Girija Vyas said.

 She rejected the charge that the arrests were a ?conspiracy? to take over the ?mutt? and suggested that an alternative arrangement be put in place to ensure the puja continued in the absence of the two acharyas.

 Exam test for tribal youths

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 16: Of the 3.7 lakh students in Orissa who are writing their secondary examinations, which began yesterday, these 20 are a breed apart. 

 Minutes before the bell rang at 10 am to signal the beginning of yesterday?s test, 20 Bonda tribal youths trooped into a centre in Malkangiri along with their more ?regular? counterparts.

 The youths were the cynosure of all eyes because never before has anybody from the Bonda community managed to clear the examinations. Earlier, only a couple of Bondas had written the secondary examinations, but failed to crack them.

 ?It is as much a challenge for them as it is for us,? said Malkangiri district collector Manish Verma.

 Bonda youths like Somnath Kishani, Buda Muduli and Soma Dhangda Majhi, who are in the group of 20, had quit studies due to unfavourable circumstances. Some even got married and raised families. 

 Last year, the youths changed their mind and decided to take up the challenge. The district administration made special arrangements and kept the youths at MV-7 Jagannath Pali High School near Malkangiri town for four months. 

 ?We tried to teach them in the high school and fed them well. We have worked very hard to make them pass. I just hope that at least one of them clears the examinations,? Verma said. Since the parents of these youths are not aware of the benefits of education, their teachers have donned the mantle of guardians.

 The Bonda tribe is one of the oldest in the country and comprises people of Austro-Asiatic origin. They dwell on the Bonda hills, largely untouched by modern civilisation, under Khairput block at a height of 3,000 feet. 

 According to the 1971 census, the population of Bondas was 5,245. At present, there are 5,100 of them in the state.

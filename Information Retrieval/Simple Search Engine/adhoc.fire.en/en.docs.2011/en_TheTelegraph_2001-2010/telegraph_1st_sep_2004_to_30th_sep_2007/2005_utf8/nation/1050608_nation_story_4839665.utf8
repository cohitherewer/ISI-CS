 Not all can do a Vajpayee: Sangh

 New Delhi, June 7: In January 2004, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee travelled to Islamabad to revive the peace process with Pakistan after a year-long hiatus, which nearly saw the two countries go to war, the ice melted the moment Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf signed a joint statement. 

 As the former Prime Minister left Serena Hotel, where he was put up, a former aide recalled how the hotels staff as well as the Pakistani protocol officers lined up and clapped spontaneously. 

 It was an emotional moment because this one gesture reflected how much sentiments on the ground were in favour of peace, he said.

 A year-and-a-half later, when L.K. Advani travelled to Pakistan on much the same mission as leader of the Opposition, he carried a heavier baggage than Vajpayee had despite the failure of the hyped Agra summit. 

 Advani was seen as the Agra saboteur, he had Gujarat to answer for, Ayodhya to atone for and on top of it, he was allegedly named in a 1947 FIR connected with a conspiracy to assassinate Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

 With this political and ideological burden, at the end of the six-day trip he was able to convince Pakistan that he was not quite the two-horned bull they imagined he was, said sources. The persuasion was achieved through a series of calibrated statements. First, the regret expressed over the Babri Masjid demolition (he called it the saddest day of my life), then the assertion that his party had accepted the emergence of India and Pakistan as two separate, sovereign and independent nations as an unalterable reality of history and last, the tribute he penned to Jinnah while on a visit to his mausoleum in Karachi.

 The first two were received with cautious optimism in Pakistan and the last, with gratitude. The Karachi TV channels telecast it almost throughout the day and juxtaposed Advanis comments with the VHP leaders fulminations the following day to show up the hardline versus moderate divisions in the Hindu undivided family. Sources close to Advani maintained that the VHPs criticism buttressed his secular credentials in the eyes of the Pakistanis. 

 A Karachi journalist put the visit in perspective, saying: Advanis declarations are important because they have reaffirmed his commitment to the peace process. To a large extent, they undid the damage he allegedly wrought on the Agra initiative. Had the visit been a goody-goody one, bereft of these political statements, we would not have reviewed our opinion of Advani. We are willing to look at him afresh now.

 Sources said Islamabad was especially beholden to him for two reasons. By flagging off the reconstruction of the dilapidated Hindu temples at Katas Raj as part of an Indo-Pak collaborative project, he legitimised Pakistans effort to show itself as secular. 

 A member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League pointed out: This was the perfect locale. We were keen to wash away the stigma attached to Islam as being intolerant after the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues in Afghanistan by the Taliban. What better way of doing this than getting a supposed Hindu hawk to inaugurate the enterprise? 

 Advanis remarks on Jinnah were seen as being apiece with the agenda to project Pakistan as liberal and secular.

 Why then did his moves raise the hackles of the Sangh back home? An RSS pracharak said: Simple, Atalji could say anything, he could be liberal and hawkish by turn and keep his position intact. When he said in New York, I am a swayamsevak, the RSS was thrilled. When he clarified the following day what he meant was that he was a servant of the country, the RSS was not disappointed. This is because Atalji had an appeal and an image independent of the party and parivar. Advani was the creation of the cadre, the RSS, VHP and the Bajrang Dal. When he veered away from their ideology, they felt he has to pay a price.

 The BJP and the RSSs view is that through the trip, Advani has walked into a well-laid trap set by Pakistan without bringing any dividends to the party. If he continues, we will have hell to pay for, said sources.

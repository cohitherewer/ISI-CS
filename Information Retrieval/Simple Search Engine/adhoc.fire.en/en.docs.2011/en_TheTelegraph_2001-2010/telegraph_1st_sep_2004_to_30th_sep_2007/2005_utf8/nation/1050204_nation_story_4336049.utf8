 Number test for Congress in Goa

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: The 

 political realignment in Goa is far from complete with the 

 installation of a Congress-led ministry under Pratap Singh 

 Rane late last night.

 The Congress central leadership, confronted with the task of establishing majority support for the Rane ministry in the Assembly, has summoned the chief minister and state Congress president Luisinho Faleiro for consultations here tomorrow.

 The summons were sent soon after Rane expanded his two-member ministry in Panaji late this evening by inducting six ministers, including two of the four former BJP legislators who triggered the crisis for the Manohar Parrikar-led government by resigning their membership of the Assembly. Two of those inducted are from the Congress, one each from the Nationalist Congress Party and the Maharashtra Gomantak Party. There is scope for more inductions, the chief minister said.

 Rane is not yet ready to prove his majority in the Assembly whose effective strength stands at 36 in the wake of the resignation of four legislators. Governor S.C. Jamir has till this evening not directed the chief minister to seek a trust vote.

 The new Congress-led ruling combine and the Opposition BJP have 18 members each in the Assembly. The BJP members include Speaker Vishwas Satarkar.

 The Congress leadership expects that Satarkar ? a BJP member ? would quit and create a vacancy in the presiding officer?s chair before Rane takes the confidence vote. This would necessitate the ruling combine to nominate someone from its ranks to preside over the trial session, effectively reducing its strength to 17.

 The Congress general secretary in charge of Goa, Margaret Alva, remained non-committal on the party?s strategy for the confidence vote. Alva, however, said a special session of the Assembly could be called in about 10 days.

 The Congress leader did not elaborate how the party would prove its majority if it had to nominate someone from the ruling combine as presiding officer, but merely said: ?Wait for more developments.?

 There are indications that the Congress is banking on persuading at least one more MLA from the BJP ranks to quit the Assembly before the trust vote.

 The BJP, aware of the delicate numbers? situation, today shifted its legislators to the national capital. All the legislators other than the Speaker met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today and protested about the ?illegal and conspiratorial? action of the governor last night and urged him to intervene.

 Parrikar, who led the delegation of legislators, later told journalists at the BJP headquarters that the party could legally challenge the governor?s decision.

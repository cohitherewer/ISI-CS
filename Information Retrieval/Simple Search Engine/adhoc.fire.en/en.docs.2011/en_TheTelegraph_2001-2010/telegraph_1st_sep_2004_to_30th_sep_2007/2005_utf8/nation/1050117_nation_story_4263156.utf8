 Kathmandu, Jan. 16 (PTI): Maoists today released all the 14 Gorkha Regiment soldiers of the Indian Army who were abducted two days ago from Chuha village in Kailali district in western Nepal, Indian embassy sources said.

 The soldiers stationed in Jammu and Kashmir were released this afternoon at the initiative of the Informal Sector Service Centre, a Nepalese human rights group.

 The soldiers were on leave and were travelling in a bus to their homes in different districts, including Dang, Kaski and Nuwakot, when they were abducted, The Kathmandu Post had reported.

 The rebels abducted the soldiers despite being told that they belonged to the Indian Army, the sources said.

 ?The soldiers are reported to have been kidnapped from the bus they were travelling in,? an army officer had said.

 SC lock on polluting units 

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Supreme Court has ordered the Centre to issue directives to close down 218 industrial and mining units across the country within 10 days for violating environment norms.

 A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and P.P. Naolekar asked the government yesterday to issue the closure notifications to several states and file a compliance report within six weeks. 

 The order came on a petition by Goa Foundation, a social organisation, which contended that hundreds of industrial and mining units were operating without clearance from environment and pollution control boards. 

 Goa tops the list with 31 polluting units followed by Rajasthan with 23, according to an affidavit the Centre had filed. 

 Among the other states on the list are Haryana, Maharashtra (both have 20 polluting units each), Chhattisgarh (18), Madhya Pradesh (15), Orissa (7), Gujarat and Tamil Nadu (5 each), Andhra Pradesh (2) and Jharkhand and Bengal (1 each). 

 Of the 218 units, 148 are in the mining sector. The industrial units are mainly engaged in production of asbestos, bulk drugs, finished leather, pesticides, chemical dyes and cement and in electroplating and setting up distilleries. 

 Raj Panjwani, the petitioner?s counsel, said these units have been defying orders of the court on environment protection and have not bothered to get clearance certificates.

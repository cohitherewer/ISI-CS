The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Match on DD, duo no-balled 

 OUR BUREAU

 Chennai/Calcutta, Feb. 24: Zee Telefilms and rival ESPN STAR Sports were edged out of the race to telecast the India-Pakistan cricket series as Madras High Court decided to continue with a Supreme Court order last year allowing state-run Doordarshan to relay the matches in India.

 In the interim ruling, Justice K.P. Sivasubramaniam directed public broadcaster Prasar Bharati to telecast the series and gave the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) the freedom to engage any producer, except Zee Telefilms and ESPN STAR Sports, for the live feed. 

 Zee and ESPN had both offered to produce the Tests and one-day internationals and agreed to provide the feed to Doordarshan and deposit advertising revenues with the BCCI.

 Justice Sivasubramaniam, who said he was following ?what the Supreme Court had said? in its order last year, also asked Prasar Bharati, through the BCCI, to ?maintain proper accounts of the receipts from the telecast?.

 It is not clear yet who would produce the three Tests and six one-dayers, but sources said the BCCI may ask the Dubai-based Ten Sports to produce the series while the Singapore-based Sony Entertainment Television is a frontrunner for bagging overseas rights. 

 The BCCI had made a similar deal during the Australia and South Africa series last year. Ten Sports had handled production while Sony was given the rights to market them in other countries.

 However, the high court today allowed the BCCI the freedom to approach any satellite company other than Sony for telecasting the series abroad.

 The first Test gets underway in Mohali on March 8.

 Though the judge was earlier inclined to pass a ?short order containing only conclusions? on Zee?s writ petition, and give his elaborate reasoning later, he said he was ?left with no other option or alternative except to pass an interim order now?. 

 Official sources said Prasar Bharati is looking to market the series at Rs 6 lakh for a 10-second slot for the one-dayers. When India toured Pakistan last year, the corresponding rate was Rs 4.5 lakh.

 Prasar Bharati has refused to provide special match highlights to any other broadcaster.

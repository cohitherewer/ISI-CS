New Delhi, Aug. 30: Mulayam Singh Yadav wants the Centre to treat the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in parts of Uttar Pradesh as a national tragedy.

 With 51 fresh cases pouring into hospitals in the state in the last 48 hours and the death toll crossing 300, the disease has acquired epidemic proportions. 

 The Uttar Pradesh chief minister wants the Centre to take emergency steps to procure the encephalitis vaccine.

 The state additional-director (health), D.P. Mishra, today said: The official death toll since the outbreak of the disease has risen to 303.

 Over 1,130 patients are being treated at district hospitals in Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Basti, Siddharthnagar and Kushinagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Fresh cases have also been reported from neighbouring Bihar and Nepal.

 In a letter to Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, Mulayam Singh demanded that the Centre import over 75 lakh vials of vaccine from South Korea and Japan.

 You told me about the steps taken by the central government to prevent this disease that has been claiming lives since 1978.

 The sad part, however, is that none of these steps has proved to be effective. The only way to curb the spread of this disease is vaccination, he wrote.

 The chief minister claimed that the Centre had made four lakh doses of the vaccine available. We have used all those doses. But the problem is that the disease has spread over vast tracts. In Gorakhpur district alone, we need to vaccinate about 75 lakh poor children. Beside Gorakhpur, vast areas in the Terai region need to be covered.

 According to the state government, a vaccination programme on such a largescale cannot be carried out without central assistance.

 Mulayam Singh said: Senior health ministry officials have indicated that even if we increase the vaccine-producing capacity at the Central Research Institute, Kasauli, we would still be able to produce only five to six lakh vaccines. In a situation like this, there is no option but to import the vaccine from South Korea and Japan. 

 I am told these vaccines have not yet been approved by the WHO. But we should try and get the approval so that the lives of lakhs of children can be saved.

 Describing it as a national tragedy, he said: The central government should bear the cost of the vaccine that we would import.

 Although Ramadoss has not responded yet, a health ministry spokesperson said vaccines are a preventive measure. 

 Once the disease has acquired epidemic proportions, there is very little that a vaccination programme can achieve.

 Union minister of state for home Prakash Jaiswal has held a meeting with state principal secretary (health) Dipti Vilas and other officials to prepare a strategy to stop the spread of the disease.

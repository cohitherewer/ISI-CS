 Sachin wants mastery over his brand destiny

 Mumbai, Nov. 20: Sachin Tendulkar is considering launching his own sports management company to handle his brand as well as those of other talented Indian sportspersons.

 Tendulkar, who has so far been managed by WorldTel ? once led by his late friend Mark Mascarenhas ? is giving deep thought to striking out by himself in the cut-throat world of sports endorsements, an industry source close to the cricketer said. Tendulkars current Rs 100-crore contract expires on December 31 this year.

 The master batsmans association with the Connecticut-based company began in 1996 when he signed a multimillion-dollar deal with them. International Management Group (IMG) had also bid for him and lost.

 Although there was no official disclosure on the amount paid to him, sources say that the five-year contract starting 1996 fetched him close to $10 million (about Rs 40 crore). It must have been a happy association, because Tendulkar renewed the contract beginning 2001 for an incredible Rs 100 crore spread over five years.

 But now several other heavyweight firms, too, are wooing him. Apart from IMG, there is the fast-emerging celebrity endorsement firm, Percept DMark, and Nimbus Sport.

 Industry insiders say the front-runners are WorldTel and Percept DMark and there is serious bargaining over the sum. Tendulkar apparently feels he deserves a hike over the WorldTel contract.

 Sachins good show in the Sri Lanka series seems to have boosted his confidence a lot. He is an intelligent and shrewd negotiator. He wasnt coming on so forcefully even after the Challenger Cup, where he did not fare too well. But now the scene is very different, said a senior official of a firm negotiating with him.

 He is not a man in a hurry any more, said Nitin Beri, vice-president (sports), Percept DMark. He is taking his time and it is clear that he will take a considered decision only after he finishes playing the South Africa series.

 The cricketer, who used to be managed by his brother Ajit before the WorldTel days, is apparently keen on a role for his sibling in managing him.

 The hard-bargaining attitude of officials of various endorsement companies during his lean patch has disenchanted him in a way. And he is seriously considering launching his own firm to manage his image and putting his brother at the helm, said an industry official who happens to be a close friend of the cricketer.

 Besides, advertisers are no longer keen on five-year contracts as the form of a cricketer is crucial. In the case of Tendulkar, the players fitness is a concern. One is not sure how many more years he will be able to play, the official added.

 But the player is reportedly adamant. It is either a five-year deal with a hike over the WorldTel figures or none.

 As things stand now, we have given him an offer of around Rs 25 crore a year, which is 5 crore more than what he was getting so far annually. But negotiations havent moved much since the cricket season started, said a leading sports management firm official.

 Though many feel this might be Sachins last big endorsement contract, the legend is keen to reinvent himself, say his industry friends.

 A cricket academy is very much on his mind. But above all, Sachin wants to enhance his brand further at a time when most people feel the next five years may be his last as a brand, a source said.

 Till recently, legendary spinner Shane Warne was seen as the global face of the cricket world; but he slipped as a brand because of his off-the-field misdemeanours. 

 The non-controversial Sachin, with his wholesome and faith-invoking image, wants to fill the space. He wants to emerge as the David Beckham of cricket, said another negotiator.

 Brands had not been making a beeline for the cricketer in recent times. Yet Tendulkar even today gets Rs 6.5-7 crore per sponsorship compared with the Rs 1-1.5 crore charged by Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag or Sourav Ganguly.

 A recent survey in Delhi made it clear why Tendulkar is still the top cricketing brand. When asked what is the first word that comes to your mind when you think of cricket, 40 per cent said it was Sachin Tendulkar.

 The legend also elicited the following associations: amazing, centuries, gentleman, genius, style, MRF, the master, sixes, great.

 Tendulkar knows the value of his brand only too well.

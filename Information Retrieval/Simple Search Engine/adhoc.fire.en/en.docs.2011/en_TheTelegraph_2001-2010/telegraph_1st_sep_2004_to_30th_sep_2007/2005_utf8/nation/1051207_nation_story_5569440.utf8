 Volcker row rocks Houses 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: The Volcker issue refused to die down even after Natwar Singh offered to quit.

 An unrelenting Opposition stalled Parliament proceedings for the third day running, saying it would not settle for anything less then Sonia Gandhis scalp. 

 The BJP-led Opposition members jumped into the well raising slogans against the Congress president. UPA ka dekho khel, kha gaya chara, pee gaya tel (UPA rule is marked by fodder and oil scams) and Ab to yeh spasht hai Sonia Gandhi bhrasht hai (Now there is no doubt that Sonia Gandhi is corrupt) they shouted.

 The sloganeering reached a peak as the ruling party members tried to counter- attack by raising the Babri demolition, today being its 13th anniversary. They also flashed copies of a media report on NDAs alleged involvement in the Iraqi oil scam.

 In the Upper House, chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat asked the ruling party members to take questions amid the din. 

 In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee was able to get two legislations passed ?Prevention of Insults to National Honour (Amendment) Bill, 2005 and the State Emblem Of India (Prohibition Of Improper Use) Bill 2004.

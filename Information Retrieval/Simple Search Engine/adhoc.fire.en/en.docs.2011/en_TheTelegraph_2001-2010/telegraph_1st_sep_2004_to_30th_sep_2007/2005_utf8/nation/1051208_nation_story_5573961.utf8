 Bar on crucifix, not kirpan, in UK school

 London, Dec. 7: Question: When is a religious symbol not a religious symbol but a piece of jewellery?

 Answer: When its a crucifix.

 This is the policy which has got a British school mired in controversy this week.

 Sinfin Community School in Derby permits the wearing of the kara and little symbolic kirpans by Sikh pupils but will not permit Christian children to display the crucifix.

 In fact, a 16-year-old girl, Sam Morris, was sent back home last week for refusing to take off her crucifix and not allowed back for two days until she agreed to leave behind the offending piece of jewellery at home.

 This has provoked sections of the British press to castigate the school for double standards ? being nice to foreigners and their religion and being nasty to Christian children.

 The decision to send Sam home was taken by Howard Jones, deputy headmaster of the comprehensive school, which has 1,070 pupils.

 Jones said the expulsion order was served on Sam after he failed to persuade her to remove her crucifix during a 30-minute conversation last Thursday. He explained that the school maintained a strict ban on jewellery, but allowed icons which were compulsory to certain faiths.

 Yesterday, after Sam returned to school, minus the crucifix, Howard explained: There was a long period of persuasion with her and she was given time. It was only at the end of that that I reluctantly had to exclude her for a day. I met her mother and readmitted her daughter.

 He said that the schools strict jewellery policy, which banned large earrings or items worn on the outside of clothing, was aimed at avoiding accidents and removing temptation from thieves.

 Explaining why Sikh boys were treated differently, Jones said: As a Christian I dont have to wear a crucifix but Sikhs dont have that option and we have to be understanding. We live in a multi-faith society.

 However well meaning his action, the crucifix ban will be interpreted widely as political correctness or positive discrimination gone too far.

 Sams mother, Debra Saunders, who intends lodging a formal complaint with the school governors, pointed out: Sam has worn this necklace for more than three years and it is of great sentimental value to her. No one has told her to take it off before and she doesnt want to.

 She added: She thinks it is very unfair when other people are allowed to wear religious symbols and it just ends up creating a divide between the pupils when everyone is told they should be living in unity.

 The city council in Derby, which has a sizeable ethnic minority population, confirmed that the ban on crucifixes was legal.

 But whether it is desirable is another matter, a spokesman said. For some people a crucifix could be a deeply religious gesture, which is why personal needs should be taken into account.

 In the Express newspaper, a Tory MP, Ann Widdecombe, a Christian well-known for her Right-wing views, said: To persecute a young girl like this for her religious beliefs, whatever they are, is unacceptable. It is a crazy decision.

 Nor are such disputes restricted to Britain. 

 Two years ago, an Italian judge ordered a primary school in the town of LAquila, 60 miles from Rome, to remove crucifixes from classroom walls following a complaint from a local Muslim leader, Adel Smith. 

 Smith had initially suggested that a symbol from the Koran should be displayed alongside the crucifix in his childrens classrooms. When this was denied, he took his complaint to the courts. 

 The judge ruled that the crucifixes showed the unequivocal desire by the state, when it comes to public education, to place the Catholic religion at the centre of the universe, in disregard for other religions. 

 The ruling shocked the Roman Catholic Church.

 Its because the crucifix still has strong religious symbolism even in the secular west that its inappropriate use continues to upset believers.

 Crucifixes are sexy because theres a naked man on them, the pop singer Madonna once said.

 Her 1989 video, Like a Prayer, caused widespread offence with its images of a black Christ-like figure on a crucifix weeping blood while apparently engaging in sexual activity with the singer.

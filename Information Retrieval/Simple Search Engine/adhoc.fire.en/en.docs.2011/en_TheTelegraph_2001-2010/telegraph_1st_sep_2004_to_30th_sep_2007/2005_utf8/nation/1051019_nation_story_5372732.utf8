 Lock amp; STD call trap widow killer

 New Delhi: A mason-turned-burglar stabbed 

 to death an aged woman living alone in an upscale flat in 

 east Delhi but a self-locking door kept him trapped in the 

 puja room till the widows Bangalore-based daughter 

 alerted neighbours when a morning phone call went unanswered.

 The murder showed again how the elderly have become soft targets in the capital and it came less than a month after 67-year-old Amarjit Kaur was strangled by intruders with the connivance of her domestic help.

 Saroj Mohan, the widow of former income-tax commissioner Rajinder Mohan, was a resident of Pushpanjali Enclave of east Delhi. Her routine drew the attention of Ram Pujan, who was working as a mason in a building close by.

 According to police, Ram Pujan gained entry into the house around 4 am. But Saroj caught him looting the house and tried to fight him. He first hit her on the head with the knife, stabbed her and then strangled her using a scarf.

 When Ram Pujan entered the prayer room to remove some ornaments he had spotted on the idols, the self-locking door closed and he was trapped. He then decided to wait till the morning and slip out, the police said.

 After murdering her, Ram Pujan went to the puja room. He thought that since she is living alone, no one will detect the murder and he will be able to escape in the morning, said Madhup Tiwari, the deputy commissioner of police, east Delhi.

 But Sarojs daughter Ashima, who lives in Bangalore, called her mother at 7 am on Tuesday. When there was no response, she called one of her mothers neighbours.

 The neighbours knocks on Sarojs door went unheeded and another, who had a duplicate key, opened the door. Inside, they found Saroj in a pool of blood.

 By then the police had been informed. We came and saw that the door to the puja room was locked. When we opened it, we found Ram Pujan inside, Tiwari said. 

 Rape term

 New Delhi (PTI): A court has sentenced 

 a woman to seven years in jail for conspiring with and abetting 

 her husband to rape another woman.

 The court also fined Sarla Rs 1,500, observing that being a woman, she cannot be held guilty of gangrape, but can be convicted of criminal conspiracy. 

 Her husband Dhan Bahadur has been declared a proclaimed offender as he has been evading arrest. 

 The victim, a resident of Bengal, came to Delhi two years ago to live with her sister in Govindpuri and got a job at a factory in Okhla, where her sister and Sarla worked. On July 27, 2003, they went out in search of a new job and after an unsuccessful day, she stayed at Sarlas house and was raped by Dhan Bahadur in front of his wife. 

 Pakistani held

 Jaipur (PTI): A Pakistani has been arrested 

 in Ajmer without valid papers. Mahmood Ahmad came on a pilgrimage 

 at the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti.

October 21. Pracheen Kala Kendra, in association with Chandigarh School of Drama, will organise the event.

 Rape charge on filmmaker

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct 30: An Andheri-based filmmaker was arrested today on charges of raping an 11-year-old neighbour at his Versova residence. 

 The girls family lodged a complaint against the little-known director, identified as Gautam Verma, after which Versova police sprang to action.

 Both the accused and the victim have been sent for medical tests.

 According to the complaint, Verma called the girl to his flat yesterday around 3.30 in the afternoon and raped her.

 Verma had recently launched a film titled The Agreement starring Riya Sen, the police said.

 The incident comes close on the heels of a series of rape and molestation cases involving policemen in the city. 

 Six months after the rape of a college student by a drunk constable on Marine Drive, another tipsy policeman was arrested on the charge of raping a 15-year-old in a garden a stones throw from his police station.

 Public outrage over these sexual offences have forced Mumbai police to deal stringently with errant behaviour. Policemen at all levels have been placed under the scannner to check alcoholism on duty.

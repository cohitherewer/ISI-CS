 Robbers strike, patients pay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 16: Doctors in Agra are refusing to see patients after sundown because a group of robbers had gained entry into a colleagues home by posing as patients.

 A team of doctors from the Indian Medical Associat- ion, Agra branch, met the district magistrate and city police commissioner today and informed them about their decision.

 All doctors chambers were closed today by 5 pm, when dusk begins to fall this time of the year.

 We are helpless. We are for saving peoples lives but in discharging this professional duty, we cannot jeopardise our own lives, a spokesman for the medical association said.

 The robbers had arrived at heart specialist Pravin Jains home in Kamlanagar around 9 pm on November 12. They knocked on the door, saying they had brought a critical patient.

 As soon as Dr Jain opened the door, they barged in, beat up the family and left with cash, ornaments and other booty.

 City doctors have already given up their morning walks after a colleague was kidnapped a week ago and forced to pay a huge ransom.

 The doctors say they have approached their local police stations, the special superintendent of police as well as the commissioner but none has been able to promise them security.

 Special superintendent of police Gulab Singh explained that it was impossible to provide security to all doct- ors. We have stepped up vigilance on the gangs but how can we arrange security for all doctors?

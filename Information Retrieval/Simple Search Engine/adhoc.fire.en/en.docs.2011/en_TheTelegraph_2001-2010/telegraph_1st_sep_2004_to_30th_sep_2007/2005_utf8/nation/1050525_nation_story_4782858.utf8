 Media foeticide check 

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, May 24: Alarmed at the skewed sex ratio, Haryana is now turning to the media for help to stem female foeticide.

 Social evils like a preference for the male child, neglect of the girl child and dowry have heavily tilted the balance against women in the state, bringing down their number to a dismal 827 per 1,000 men.

 The health department has decided to request the media to be on the lookout for clinics and doctors misusing pre-natal diagnostic techniques. 

 Mediapersons can help in locating clinics and doctors responsible for the dismal child sex-ratio. They can also educate the masses on the harmful effects of the barbaric practice of female foeticide. They can gather information that is difficult for us to compile against violators of the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation amp; Prevention of Misuse) Act 1994 and Amendment Act, 2002. 

 They can play a vital role in arresting the imbalance that can lead to tremendous problems in the years to come. Men are already scouting other states for brides and even buying them because of the shortage here, a health department official said. 

 Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had, at a rally in Jind on May 14, expressed concern over the sex ratio and urged the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government to act fast.

 The need to turn to the media for help to net those misusing pre-natal diagnostic techniques follows the failure of the Devirupak scheme launched by the previous government.

 Under the scheme, couples adopting a permanent method of sterilisation after the birth of the first girl child were given Rs 500 per month for 20 years. Those adopting permanent sterilisation at the birth of the first male child or the second girl child got Rs 200 per month for 20 years. However, less than 500 of Haryanas 21-lakh strong population availed of permanent sterilisation, while a mere 5,500 registered themselves under the scheme.

 Following in Haryanas footsteps, Punjab, which has a sex ratio of 793, has now devised a similar project.

 Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh have earned the none too flattering sobriquet of being Indias Bermuda Triangle, where girls vanish without a trace. The grim scenario of an ever-dwindling sex ratio is now belatedly attracting the attention of governments and non-governmental organisations in the three states.

 Against a national average of 927, the ratio dips to less than 800 in the districts of Kurukshetra, Sonepat, Ambala, Kaithal and Rohtak.

 Mediapersons can play a useful role in helping to nab doctors and quacks who, despite the PNDT Act, continue to flourish, the health department official added.

 The state has also constituted a task force to conduct raids on clinics and doctors to curb pre-natal sex determination and female foeticide. Such raids will be given wide publicity. Apart from launching a sustained awareness campaign on the issue, the task force will gather information on the number of pregnant women in each block and seek reasons for abortions.

 The government has inspected 2,183 centres in various regions of the state and seized 51 ultrasound machines. Registration of 100 ultrasound clinics have either been suspended or cancelled under the PNDT Act. As many as 22 cases have been filed against violators of the act.

 Besides setting up the task force, that will focus mainly on netting offenders, the government plans to take measures to tackle the root of the problem by holding meetings at the grassroots level, organising regular workshops, seminars, talks and exhibitions at public health centres at the block and district levels.

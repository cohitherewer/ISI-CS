 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 13: The chief of the US Pacific Command, Admiral William J.

 India and the US today also signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in military medicine. The agreement was signed between the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) and the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda.

 The agreement will foster exchanges between medical personnel of Indian and US armed forces, a US embassy release said. It will enable them to enhance their knowledge in areas such as management of emerging infectious diseases, clinical trials, biological warfare and preparedness of military medical personnel in the art of casualty and disaster management.

 The agreement was signed by the director-general of Armed Forces Medical College, Lt General J.R. Bhardwaj, and USUHS president Dr Emmanuel Cassimatis.

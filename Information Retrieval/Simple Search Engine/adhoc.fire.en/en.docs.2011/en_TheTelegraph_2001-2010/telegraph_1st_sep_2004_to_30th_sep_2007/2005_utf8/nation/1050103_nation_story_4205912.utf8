 Tiruchirapalli (PTI): Casurina trees raised on 500 hectares of land between Kodiampalayam and Vedaranyam to shield the region from cyclonic storms have helped in checking the impact of the tsunami.

 Porayar (Tamil Nadu) (PTI): A 40-year-old man survived the tsunami, but was killed on Sunday when he was trampled by a temple elephant at Thirukkadaiyur village near here.

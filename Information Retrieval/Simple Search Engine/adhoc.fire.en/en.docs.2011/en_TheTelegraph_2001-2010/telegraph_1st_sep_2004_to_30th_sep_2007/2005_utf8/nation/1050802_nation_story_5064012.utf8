 Bhutan clears air on China pact

 new 

 delhi: With reports surfacing that Thimphu has agreed 

 to change the claim lines on its border with 

 China, Bhutans king Jigme Singye Wanchuk on Monday 

 reassured India that he would do nothing to harm the interest 

 of his countrys most important neighbour and ally, 

 reports our special correspondent.

 Bhutans strategic position 

 is important for both Delhi and Beijing. Any change in the 

 current status of its boundary with China will impact India. 

 Early this year, India and China had reached an agreement 

 on the guiding principles and political parameters 

 that would help solve their decade-old border dispute.

 The king met foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan on Monday. Over the next few days, he will talk to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister Shivraj Patil. A meeting with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi is on the cards on Tuesday.

 Sections of the Indian media have suggested that Delhi is worried over the boundary agreement Bhutan seemed to have reached with China. But senior officials in South Block brushed off such alarmist reports, saying the king would never threaten Indias interest as Bhutan is Delhis closest ally.

 Bhutanese sources denied the reported agreement between Thimphu and Beijing. They said the talks, which have been going on for years, have reached a stage where the two sides are now in a position to, perhaps, exchange maps. They stressed that no decision would be taken by keeping India in the dark.

 China, too, accepts this position and says the pace of the talks will depend on Indias stand. 

 Navy leak

 new 

 delhi: The navy is probing the pilferage of information 

 from its computer network but defence minister Pranab Mukherjee 

 said reports that war plans had leaked were bunkum.

 A senior official said evidence 

 had been found that information of the navys acquisition 

 plans for small patrol craft was downloaded about 10 days 

 ago. 

 Betting arrests 

 rajkot 

 (PTI): A father-son duo has been arrested for being allegedly 

 involved in betting during the India-West Indies cricket 

 match on Sunday. Acting on a tip-off police raided their 

 house in Sahakar Nagar in Gujarat and seized a computer 

 and a mobile phone.

 UP crime map

 allahabad 

 (PTI): Uttar Pradesh police will have a digital crime map 

 for the state. The computerised system will relieve officers 

 from going through hundreds of pages to review the crime 

 situation.

 Doordarshan will produce a 110-minute programme to observe the birth centenary of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. The documentary will be in a serial format.

 Srinagar July 30: For almost 24 hours, residents cowered in their homes and shopkeepers and commuters in shuttered stores and offices while security forces fought and killed two militants in the heart of Srinagar.

 The siege of downtown Lal Chowk ended this afternoon after a combined team of police and paramilitary stormed a hotel and a shopping complex where the militants were holed up.

 The guerrillas had struck on Friday at the commercial hub, attacking police posts and a government office as shoppers, commuters and tourists ran helter-skelter. The attackers killed two paramilitary jawans before the security forces drove one of them into a Gujarati hotel and the other hid in a shopping complex.

 The state police, BSF and CRPF ? backed by armoured jeeps and trucks mounted with machineguns ? then ringed the buildings and sealed off the entire area, forcing commuters to spend the night in their offices and shopkeepers in their stores. Several tourists were trapped in the hotel.

 Some 25 bank employees and a few children were holed up in a Uco Bank branch and employees of the Daily Aftab in their office while the densely populated area rang with the sound of firing and explosions through the evening, night and morning.

 It was as if everything was happening at my doorstep. I had to keep on assuring my wife and two kids that we were safe, said Abdul Rashid, who lives in neighbouring Maisuma.

 We have killed the two holed-up militants, inspector-general Javed Ahmad Mukhdoomi of Kashmir police said. We are now busy searching the area to ensure there are no more militants hiding anywhere.

 The security forces had resumed the operation early this morning but received an initial setback when the special operations group came under heavy fire from the hotel. One jawan was critically injured.

 Of the 25 people wounded since yesterday, 14 are civilians, including eight journalists. One of them, Sahara TV cameraman Muzaffar, took a bullet in the abdomen and was fighting for his life this evening. He was moved to Delhi for specialised treatment.

 As the security forces were withdrawing after the operation, residents came out on the streets chanting anti-India slogans, prompting the police to use tear gas.

 The site of the gunfight is close to the secretariat ? the seat of governance in the state ? as well as the chief ministers official residence. It is also the hub of trade and tourism.

 HC to hear gutka baron Dubai plea 

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court on Monday 

 will hear gutka baron Jagdish Joshis plea seeking 

 permission to visit Dubai. 

 The Dubai-based owner of Goa Gutka had earlier surrendered his passport after non-bailable warrants were issued against him and Manikchand Dhariwal, chief of Manikchand Gutka, for failing to appear in a case in which they are accused of having underworld links.

 The CBI has already informed the trial court that it would oppose Joshis plea to visit Dubai because he had not co-operated with the agency in the probe.

 Joshi and Dhariwal were in Dubai when they had been asked to appear in court and had expressed their inability to visit India immediately to maintain their NRI status. 

 Later, both the accused appeared before the CBI on several occasions.

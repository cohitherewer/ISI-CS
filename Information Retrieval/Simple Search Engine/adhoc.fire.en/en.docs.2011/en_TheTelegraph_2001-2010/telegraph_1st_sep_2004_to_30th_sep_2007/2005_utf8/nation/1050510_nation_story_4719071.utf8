 AIIMS nod to Kanshi treatment 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: A team of doctors of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in a statement to the Supreme Court observed that Bahujan Samaj Party founder Kanshi Ram need not be hospitalised and said the treatment offered to him at Mayavatis residence was ?proper?. 

 The AIIMS team was appointed by the court after Kanshi Rams family members complained that BSP chief Mayavati was keeping him in illegal custody and was medically neglecting him. His mother Bishan Kaur filed a petition stating that she was prevented from visiting her ailing son.

 Mayavati in turn alleged that Kanshi Rams family members had, at the behest of her political rivals, filed a petition that he was being illegally confined by her and claimed ? in an affidavit to the Supreme Court ? that the party founder was staying with her voluntarily.

 The division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha asked Kaurs counsel to go through the AIIMS report and file objections, if any, within eight weeks. 

 The court had earlier ordered the team of doctors to ?determine whether the line of treatment given to Kanshi Ram at Mayavatis home is appropriate? and whether it was necessary for him to be treated in hospital.

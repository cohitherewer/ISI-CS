 London, Dec. 14: Pakistanis and Indians in the UK combined forces to put on a gala concert and fashion show at the Royal Albert Hall in London which raised between ?30,000 and ?40,000 for earthquake victims in Kashmir.

 Making it clear that much more needs to be done to help the victims of the earthquake which has killed 73,000 and made 3.3 million homeless, the Pakistani high commissioner in London, Maleeha Lodhi, said: The challenge is far from over ? we cant afford compassion fatigue. There are too many lives at stake.

 Lodhi softened her image as a hard-as-nails, no-nonsense diplomat by wearing a pink salwaar kameez. Nor did she cover her head with a dupatta as Benazir Bhutto was wont to do.

 Lodhi spoke of the plight of parents who had lost their children and children who had been orphaned and commented: We need to rebuild the entire region of the country.

 There has been a feeling in sections of Pakistani community in Britain that perhaps more money might have been raised, given the scale of the earthquake tragedy. 

 But the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) ? an umbrella organisation that has coordinated appeals by 13 agencies, including Action Aid, Care International UK, British Red Cross, Christian Aid, Help the Aged, Islamic Relief, Oxfam and Save the Children ? dismissed the notion that the British had not been generous enough. 

 From the DEC point of view, we are very pleased with the generosity of the British public, said a spokeswoman. This is our third biggest appeal. We have seen no evidence of compassion fatigue.

 She disclosed that ?40 million had been pledged so far to help quake victims, which compared with the ?372 million raised after last years tsunami and ?53 million after the humanitarian crisis following the civil war in Kosovo.

 Last nights concert was organised by Asia House, a cultural organisation, in association with the Asian Music Circuit and the Pakistan-Britain Trade and Investment Forum.

 It was supported by a few Indian business houses, including the Hinduja Foundation (the family hails from Sindh, after all) and Kartar Lalvanis Vitabiotics, a company which makes vitamin supplements.

 I wanted to show Indian solidarity, Lalvani said today.

 Although it was essentially a Pakistani show, remarkably no Pakistani flag was on display ? which seemed like a major concession to the Indians. 

 One highlight of the evening was a performance by Ghulam Ali, the renowned Pakistani ghazal singer. Another was a session of qawwali by the Nizami brothers from old Delhi, who were joined by the Niyazi brothers ? their cousins from Pakistan in the spirit of friendship and cooperation between India and Pakistan.

 Faakhir, lead singer of a pop group from Karachi, said he had arrived at 2 pm yesterday and was leaving at 10 pm as I need to get back to sing for President Musharraf.

 This throwaway remark suggests that the views held by many mullahs in Pakistan that pop music is unIslamic are not one shared by Musharraf ? a definite plus as far as the West is concerned.

 To show Pakistan is not all about madarsas, there was a fashion show last night in which the American singer, Lisa B, took a leading role.

 There was a turnout of personalities from the UK stage, screen and television actors of Indian and Pakistani origin who now prefer to call themselves British Asian.

 One of them, film director Gurinder Chadha, recalled a recent emotional trip to Jhelum in Pakistan where she had gone for a BBC documentary ? Who do you think you are? ?tracing her grandfathers house and her familys roots (the family came to Britain via Kenya). She said she was showered with rose petals, given a shawl by local women and treated as a daughter who had returned home.

 It has to be said that British Asian artists in the UK have had an influence in bringing together young Indians and Pakistanis in Britain.

 Chadha hoped that British Asians would be able to put on more joint events. People are people, we are all the same.

 The money from last nights concert will be given to the Pakistan Presidents Fund, Islamic Relief, Learning for Life and the Eidhi Foundation.

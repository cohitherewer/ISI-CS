 Kids live with dead

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

Hyderabad, Jan. 2: A teenage boy and his younger 

sister lived with the corpses of their mother and a brother for over four months 

for fear of losing the family?s only source of income ? their father?s pension.

 Arun Kumar, 16, and Priya, 14, were found out yesterday when their landlady on Friday forced herself into their house in Shivajinagar colony of Nellore town, about 600 km from Hyderabad.

 ?The children kept telling that their mother was not well or in the bathroom whenever I went to meet her,? the landlady said. She suspected something was wrong as she had not seen Sai Leela, 42, for months.

 The police of the town believe that the threat of starvation made the teenagers live with the bodies as their father?s pension was payable only to their mother.

 Leela, the police said, had died in her sleep on August 16 from pneumonic fever. Venkatesh, 12, died four days later apparently of diarrhoea. But the police suspect that Venkatesh might have been strangled by his siblings out of the fear that he might spill the beans. The bodies were beyond recognition, they added.

 The landlady said she was horrified to see the girl watching a television programme, sitting amid the dirt, stench and decaying bodies.

 A statement that Arun gave to the police said he drew the pension from the bank every month. ?None asked him about his mother as he was drawing the money regularly for over two years,? the police said.

 He also went about daily chores as always. ?I carried packed food for my sister and myself every day from a hotel,? Arun told local television channels.

 But he, however, made sure that no outsider, not even the electricity-meter reader, could enter the house. 

The siblings had turned a deaf ear to neighbours? 

complaint of a stench emanating from the house and the landlady?s threat to throw 

them out if they did not do something about it.

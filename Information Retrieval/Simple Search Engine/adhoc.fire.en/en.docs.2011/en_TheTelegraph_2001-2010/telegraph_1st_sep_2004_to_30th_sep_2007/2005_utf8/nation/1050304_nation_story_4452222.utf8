 CPM salvo at Razi role

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 3: The CPM has described as ?controversial? the manner in which the Jharkhand governor has ?gone about ascertaining the support of the two political combinations? in the state.

 ?We have consistently held the position that the claims of majority support and the formation of government must be decided on the floor of the legislature,? the party said in a statement today. ?The governor or the Raj Bhavan cannot be the deciding factor,? it said.

 The CPM, an outside supporter of the Congress-led alliance at the Centre, dismissed the BJP-led combine?s ?majority claims?. ?But the manner in which the governor has gone about ascertaining the support for the two combinations is controversial,? it said.

 The CPM, which had protested the Indira Gandhi-led Congress?s undemocratic dismissal of governments, was, however, equally critical of the BJP for being ?also responsible for using governors in a partisan manner?.

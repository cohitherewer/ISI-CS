The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Man of straw, mocks Cong

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 10: L.K. Advani has survived, but the iron man has not. This was how a scornful Congress summed up the days drama after the leader of the Opposition withdrew his resignation as BJP president.

 The compromise formula announced by the BJP leadership, which tried to mollify the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh by virtually denying everything Advani had said about Mohammed Ali Jinnah, has made him a weaker leader, the Congress reasoned.

 The so-called man of iron is seen as less than a man of straw, Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi scoffed at the party headquarters this afternoon as TV channels flashed the breaking news of Advanis return at the helm of the BJP.

 Singhvi dubbed the last few days crisis in the BJP ? beginning with Advanis praise of Jinnah, escalating with his resignation and apparently blowing over with its withdrawal today ? the great Indian tamasha.

 These events have shown up the BJPs split personality and proved how the Sangh parivar exercises total ideological control over the party, he declared.

 The Congress does not believe todays truce in the BJP would hold for long. Its like a commercial break, Singhvi felt. The tamasha will be on again soon.

 The Congress leader, however, said it would be premature to predict who would win the struggle within the BJP, and the one between the party and the Sangh parivar. It is to be seen who will win, Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde, he remarked. 

 To the CPI, a supporter of the Congress-led ruling United Progressive Alliance, the recent events were just big drama full of duplicity.

 Party national secretary D. Raja reckoned that Advani has become weaker as he has surrendered and made a big compromise.

 Advani and his party would have to explain the drama to the nation, Raja said. What is, however, established beyond doubt is that the BJP is nothing but a political arm of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, whose ideology is communal and fascist.

 Raja, referring to the National Democratic Alliance partners support for Advanis remarks on Jinnah, asked them to clarify their position in the light of the compromise formula announced by the BJP today.

 The BJPs statement criticises Jinnah for dividing India on communal lines and says there can be no revisiting the founder of Pakistan, who led a communal agitation for the creation of that country.

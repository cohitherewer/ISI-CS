 Heat rises with capital power tariff hike

 Sheila Dikshit: Rollback ruled out

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: Delhis private power distribution companies (Discoms), owned by Reliance and Tata, are at the centre of a row over tariff rise, with a parliamentary committee declaring that the hike was unnecessary and made at the request of one of the companies.

 The capitals Resident Welfare Associations have joined hands against a recent 10 per cent tariff hike ? the rise over three years is 23 per cent ? and have refused to pay their bills. 

 The residents say they are receiving grossly inflated bills after new electronic meters were installed, which, they allege, are running much faster.

 But chief minister Sheila Dikshit has defended the increase and ruled out a rollback. Calling the opinion of the parliamentary standing committee on energy one-sided, the chief minister on Friday said the hike will stay. Privatisation of power distribution was touted as a big achievement by her government.

 The standing committee, headed by senior Congress leader Gurudas Kamat, had called for a reduction in power tariffs and questioned the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commissions role in a report tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. 

 The report said the Delhi government should stop giving financial aid to the private power companies, and that in one area regulated by Tata Power, there was no reason to raise tariff. Rather, it could be brought down since losses had been cut by 15 to 20 per cent. 

 But just to avoid the anomaly between tariffs of two Discoms areas, power tariff was revised at the request of the poorly performing private power company, the report said. 

 Dikshit accepted that anomalies would have arisen had tariff been lowered in the area served by Tata-owned North Delhi Power Limited and residents of East Delhi would have been paying more in comparison. The chief ministers son Sandeep is the Congress MP from East Delhi. 

 The report strongly recommended that the government analyse whether giving funds to private distribution companies is justified and sort out issues relating to fast-running meters, steep tariffs and non-reduction in transmission and distribution losses. 

 Addressing a news conference on Friday, Dikshit said: Discoms will not willingly like to increase the tariff at all, neither will the government. We are continually in touch with the people. We have to go through the process. It is a bitter pill that we have to swallow. We have to tighten our belts so that the future becomes better and brighter. There will be no rollback. 

 We feel upset about those few people who say they will not pay the tariffs. According to the information given by the Discoms, 99 per cent of the people have paid their bills. Those who dont pay will face accumulation of bills and legal action will follow. They will face cutting off of power. We have invited them to come to our meetings but they have not done so. This is an attempt to derail the process of reforms which has been going on smoothly. 

 However, former Delhi power minister Ajay Maken, who is now Congress MP from New Delhi, has criticised the hike and questioned the governments failure to overrule the DERC.

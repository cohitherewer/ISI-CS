 VIP relief to students

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 23: Schoolchildren in Orissa can heave a sigh of relief as they will no longer have to stand as they wait to welcome a VIP.

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who has noticed children being made to stand for hours to receive VIPs, has imposed a ban on such practice. 

 Officials in the chief ministers office said Patnaik was shocked by the spectacle of children standing for hours alongside the road to greet him, his ministerial colleagues and other VIPs during various visits and functions.

 It was quite painful to see little children lined up to receive the VIPs at a function. This practice is torture for them and must be brought to an end immediately, he told reporters, while asking the officials to implement the ban strictly in all government and non-government functions.

 Following the chief ministers order, school and mass education minister Nagendra Pradhan has advised all administrative departments and school authorities to immediately fall in line and carry out the chief ministers order.

 On many occasions, parents had expressed displeasure and anguish over their children being forced to attend, for hours together, functions held to welcome VIPs. 

 Some children had become unconscious while standing for long hours under the scorching sun.

 Childrens activists have welcomed the decision to impose a ban on schoolchildren being paraded at functions. 

 They said that unless the school and mass education department is serious about implementing the ban, it would serve no purpose.

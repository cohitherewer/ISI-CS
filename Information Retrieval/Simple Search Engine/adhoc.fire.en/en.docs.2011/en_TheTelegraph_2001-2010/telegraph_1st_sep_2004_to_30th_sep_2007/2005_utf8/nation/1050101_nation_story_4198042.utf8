 Alert ?spat? in Sonia court

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Dec. 31: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today summoned science and technology minister Kapil Sibal to express concern at the lack of coordination between ministries that led to the false alarm yesterday.

 Sibal had termed the home ministry alert to the coastal states ?hogwash?.

 Sources said home minister Shivraj Patil took serious note of Sibal?s language and took up the matter with Sonia, who sought clarifications from the science minister.

 Sibal, however, denied that he was summoned by the Congress president.

 ?I had an appointment with Gandhi yesterday but could not meet her due to some preoccupation. I met her this morning but she did not seek any clarification on the issue that cropped up yesterday. I briefed her in this regard,? he said.

 Congress sources said the science and technology minister could have avoided the controversy by merely saying that the warning was based on ?incorrect? information.

 Officially, however, the Congress came to the rescue of the home minister, saying that ?in a fast-moving event, bona fide error is possible?.

 Asked if the ?false alarm? was the result of lack of coordination between the two Union ministers, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: ?God forbid, it (the tsunami) did not happen, but if it had really happened, you (the media) would have been the first to criticise.?

 The BJP said the party did not want to criticise the government in the middle of a calamity but the ?incompetence? forced us to break our silence?.

 BJP spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said the ?spat between the ministers? had caused confusion and stalled relief work in the areas affected by the tsunami.

Bill in the works

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and BJP president L.K. Advani met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tonight to discuss relief operations in the tsunami-affected areas.

 After the 40-minute meeting, Vajpayee quoted the Prime Minister as saying that the government is in the process of preparing draft bills for disaster management at the regional and national levels.

 Advani said Singh told them that the government was studying the recommendations of the committee on disaster management, which had been set up when the NDA was in power.

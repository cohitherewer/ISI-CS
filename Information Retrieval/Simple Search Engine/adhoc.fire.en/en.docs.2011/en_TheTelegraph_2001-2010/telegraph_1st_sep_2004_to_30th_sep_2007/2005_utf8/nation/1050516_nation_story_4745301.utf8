 High on encounter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, May 15: Bihar police are on a high after yesterdays encounter with a criminal gang at Naugachhia in Bhagalpur district, in which seven gangsters were killed.

 Flush from the successful mission, director-general of police Ashish Ranjan Sinha reasserted his resolve to make the entire state crime-free.

 We have made a detailed district-wise list of notorious criminals and gangs. We are conducting an intelligence-based operation. We cant reach the gangs without intelligence, Sinha said.

 Naugachhia is only an example. Bihar has many gangsters who roam freely and without any fear. I want to ensure that such elements are wiped out forever, he added.

 The next target for the police appears to be Siwan, where they will take on another gangster, Ayub Rais Khan.

 Gangster Budhan Rai and six of his associates fell to the bullets of Naugachhia police and a Special Task Force (STF) team, who jointly conducted yesterdays operation. Rai had a reward of Rs 25,000 on his head and was wanted in over 30 criminal cases of murder, loot, rape and extortion.

 The police also recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition from the gang members, including four semi-automatic rifles, a hand grenade and over 300 live cartridges. No policeman was reportedly injured in the encounter, in which over 400 rounds of bullets were fired.

 This was the first major operation after no-nonsense officer Shobha Ohatker took charge as the superintendent of police, STF.

 However, the possible deputation of Ohatker to Maharashtra is feared to take away some of the new-found enthusiasm from the police ranks in the state. 

 Ohatker and her IAS husband C.K. Anil, the district magistrate of Siwan who has been in the news for taking on Rashtriya Janata Dal MP and strongman Mohammad Shahabuddin, are expected to be sent to Maharasthtra on special deputation by the Centre for three years.

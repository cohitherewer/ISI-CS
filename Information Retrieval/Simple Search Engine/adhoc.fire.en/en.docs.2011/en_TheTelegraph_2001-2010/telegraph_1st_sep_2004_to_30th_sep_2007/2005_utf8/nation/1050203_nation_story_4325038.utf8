 Netas give way to dons

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Feb. 2: With campaigning for the first phase of the polls coming to an end yesterday, netas in Gaya have made way for history-sheeters to take up their electoral ?cause?.

 While Bhola Miyan, a frequent ?visitor? to Gaya Central Jail, has taken command on behalf of Rashtriya Janata Dal rebel Mohan Srivastava, alleged underworld don Bachchu Yadav has padded up for his wife and Bahujan Samaj Party candidate Lalita Devi. 

 Srivastava himself is said to enjoy the patronage of Subhash Yadav, brother-in-law of chief minister Rabri Devi. Bhola?s support for him has put CPI candidate Masood Manzar in a spot of bother, as the don?s ?command? is the final word in several Muslim-dominated localities of Gaya Town, the mainstay of the Communist leader?s political survival. 

 Confusion prevails over the stand of another criminal, Sunil Kalia, believed to be a sharpshooter and an aide of Uttar Pradesh-based gangster Babloo Srivastava. A source said Kalia himself hoped to get a Lok Janshakti Party ticket from Gaya Town but was sidelined in favour of Md Alhas. 

 Concerned over the presence of potential booth-grabbers in the constituency, Gaya district magistrate Chaitanya Prasad and superintendent of police Sanjay Singh have claimed that the official machinery has taken all necessary steps to ensure a peaceful election tomorrow. The police will take stringent action against anybody who tries to disrupt the polling process, they added. 

 The two officials exhorted voters, particularly those from the backward sections of society, to exercise their franchise without fear.

 The duo claimed that adequate precautionary measures have been taken for the Town seat and five companies of Central Reserve Police Force would be deployed in that constituency alone. They added that shoot-at-sight orders have been issued against booth-grabbers. 

 Vehicles, including two-wheelers of all types, will not be allowed to move on the streets during polling. The officials have kept included ambulances and other vehicles used to carry sick people outside the purview of the ban.

 Relief for foreign workers in UAE

Dubai (PTI): The Saudi Arabia government has said it has 

no plans to stop recruitment of foreign workers.

 This comes as a relief for over 1.6 million Indians working in the country.

 ?Saudi Arabia values foreign work force and their great contributions to its development,? Saudi labour minister Ghazi al-Gosaibi was quoted as saying by the Arab News Daily.

 The country?s labour laws do not differentiate between Saudi and foreign workers in terms of rights, the minister said. 

 However, the ministry has decided to reduce foreign recruitment in a bid to create jobs for Saudis, he added.

 Last month, the cabinet had announced a series of measures to reduce dependence on foreign workers.

 Singer upset at re-mix trend

New Delhi (PTI): Veteran playback singer Vani Jayram on Saturday 

said she was upset at the manner in which musical hits of yesteryears were being 

re-mixed.

 ?I am sad to say that re-mixes are being picturised in an obscene way, with scantily clad girls dancing,? Jayram said.

 ?What will happen to the generation which is watching such numbers?? she asked. 

 ?This is not part of Indian culture,? said the singer, who was here to participate in a fundraiser 

 Earlier, each song was ?composed like a painting? and was conceived keeping in mind a particular scene, said Jayram. Much labour was put into the composition of each song, she added.

 ?Everything has become fast now. This is the age of instant food and instant coffee and fast moving numbers are being churned out. But good music will always have listeners and it will stand the test of time,? the singer said. 

 Jayram, who has sung in almost all Indian languages, felt sad as she had never been considered for a Kerala state award.

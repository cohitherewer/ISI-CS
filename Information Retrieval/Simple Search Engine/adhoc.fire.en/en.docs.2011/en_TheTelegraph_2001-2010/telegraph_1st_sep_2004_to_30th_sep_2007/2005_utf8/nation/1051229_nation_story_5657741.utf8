 Sanction row

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: India today said the recent US sanctions on two Indian companies for supplying chemicals to Iran were not justified, reports our special correspondent.

 Sabero Organics Gujarat Limited and Sandhya Organics Limited had not violated any domestic or internati-onal trade regulations, the external affairs ministry said.

 Indias commitment to prevent proliferation was second to none and its flawless track record was a result of the rigorous export control system it followed, spokesman Navtej Sarna said.

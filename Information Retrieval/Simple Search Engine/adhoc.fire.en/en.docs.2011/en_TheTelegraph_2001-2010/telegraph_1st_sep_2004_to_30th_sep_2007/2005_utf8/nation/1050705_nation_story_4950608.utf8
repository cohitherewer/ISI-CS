 Left lines up US protests

 New Delhi, July 4: After needling the UPA government on petrol price hike and Bhel disinvestment, the Left has threatened nationwide protests against the growing Indo-US defence relationship, reports our special correspondent.

 Stating that the ties impinge on Indias foreign policy and would boost arms race in the subcontinent, the Left has decided to hold demonstrations and rallies on July 8. 

 CPM leader Prakash Karat and his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan had met here yesterday and decided to raise their voice against the agreement with the US, unveiled by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee during his recent visit to Washington.

 Congress pill for state poll hiccups 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Sonia: Close watch

 New Delhi, Dec. 25: Facing a series of tough state polls, the Congress has worked out a two-pronged strategy to preserve its grip over its coalition and keep itself in shape for the big battle in 2009.

 The political resolution at Januarys All-India Congress Committee plenary, and the discussion that follows it, will focus on bolstering the party organisation while keeping the alliance ? and the partys leadership of it ? intact.

 Sources engaged in drafting the documents for the Hyderabad plenary said the formulation is the outcome of intense informal discussions in the Congress, in which two points emerged.

 One, by the time the next Lok Sabha polls are fought in 2009, the Congress would be bogged down by the anti-incumbency factor.

 Two, going by the early feedback, the party can hardly expect to do well in the next round of Assembly polls: in Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Pondicherry and Kerala.

 Even if Tamil Nadu is wrested from the ADMK, the credit would go to the Congresss ally, the DMK. 

 Nor can the Congress count on making a spectacular comeback in Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls in early 2007.

 So, if the party is defeated in state after state without offsetting it with other gains, by 2009 it could lose its primacy within the ruling coalition and find itself dictated to by its partners ? provided they were still with it.

 We must show them we are strong on the ground if our allies are to take us seriously, a party leader said.

 Sources said that after the Hyderabad plenary, Congress president Sonia Gandhi could involve herself more closely with the organisational apparatus. Since the May 2004 elections, she has concerned herself mainly with governance and making the National Advisory Council, which she heads, an effective pressure group.

 Now that the NAC has pushed her social sector agenda on to the main stage and forced the government to legislate some path-breaking measures, she should turn her attention more to the party, a source said.

 Among the other signals Hyderabad could beam are:

 Follow the example of Kerala, not Bihar, in running the central coalition. In Kerala, we have headed the United Democratic Front for years despite some electoral lows, a source said. In Bihar, we were bulldozed by the RJD.

 Return to Rajiv Gandhis policy of encouraging young leaders. Sources recalled that Digvijay Singh and Ashok Gehlot were picked as state chiefs before they were 40. But before the last Bihar polls, a 60-plus Sadanand Singh was chosen to head the state unit.

 Follow the Bihar line of stressing ideology and governance rather than caste equations. The RJD was routed in its Muslim-Yadav strongholds, a source pointed out.

 Choose candidates not because of their loyalty but on the strength of their bank of base vote. Following the leads of the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, some Congress leaders have suggested picking candidates who have polled 15,000 or more votes, say, over the last two or three elections.

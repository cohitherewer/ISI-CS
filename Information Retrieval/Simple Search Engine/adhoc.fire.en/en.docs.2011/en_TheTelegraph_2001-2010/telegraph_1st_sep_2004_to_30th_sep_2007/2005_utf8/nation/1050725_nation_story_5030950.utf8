 CPI letter to Buta on crime spurt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, July 24: The CPI has written to governor Buta Singh to convene an all-party meeting to discuss the rising crime in Bihar, a day before a high-level team of the Election Commission visits the state to take stock of the law and order situation.

 The day central rule was imposed in the state and the command came in your hand, there was hope that stern action would be taken against criminal elements active in the state. 

 But very soon, criminals fearlessly began to wreak havoc across Bihar, particularly in the state capital, CPI leader Jabbar Alam said in his letter to the governor.

 The ease with which these criminals have been committing murders, abductions and triggering explosions has created an atmosphere of terror in the state. 

 People have begun losing faith in your ability to govern. Every other day, bombs are being exploded in some locality of Patna and such incidents are taking place close to police stations.

 Alam described the situation as serious and said the party would apprise the Union home minister about it.

 If a brake is not applied, insecure people could very well take to the streets to save their lives and property. We urge you to take immediate administrative measures to contain the situation. A joint effort in this regard should be made by convening an all-party meeting, he said.

 The letter comes in the backdrop of the visit of the poll panel team tomorrow to make a district-wise study of the progress made by the state administration in implementing its earlier directive of improving the law and order situation, especially the rounding up of criminals who have habitually created trouble during polls.

 Patna High Court has also made strong observations, asking the administration to report to it on the progress made in identifying and arresting such people, particularly those facing non-bailable arrest warrants.

 Reports submitted to the Election Commission indicated that action has been taken against 1,127 people facing arrest warrants while 164 unlicensed weapons have been recovered. 

 However, the poll panel does not consider the progress satisfactory and also seeks quick action against people named in FIRs, sources said.

 The delegation arriving tomorrow, led by the panels observer, is likely to be split into four teams to facilitate detailed evaluation.

 The commission is likely to give fresh directives to speed up issuing of voter identity cards across the state.

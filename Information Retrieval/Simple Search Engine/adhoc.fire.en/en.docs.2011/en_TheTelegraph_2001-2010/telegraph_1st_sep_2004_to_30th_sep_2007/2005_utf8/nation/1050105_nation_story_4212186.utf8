 Neighbours keep Indus talks afloat

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: India and Pakistan have managed to salvage the bilateral talks on a hydel project in Jammu and Kashmir a day after Islamabad said it would seek the arbitration of the World Bank if a ?last-ditch effort? fails.

 ?We have had a good meeting. We have raised our specific concerns and sought explanations. We will try to resolve them within the parameters of the Indus Waters Treaty,? the leader of the Pakistani delegation, Ashfaq Mahmood, said at the end of the first day of the talks on the Baglihar project.

 Last month, Indian officials told their counterparts in Islamabad during talks on confidence-building measures that the 430-mw Baglihar hydro-electric project would be built on the Chenab river without violating the 1960 Indus treaty, which gives Pakistan rights over the waters of the Chenab.

 But India says the treaty also gives it rights to build hydel power projects.

 Mahmood, Pakistan?s secretary, water and power, and the leader of the 12-member Indian side, V.K. Duggal, secretary, water resources, today began talks even as there were signs that the acrimony over the Baglihar project was still at a level that makes compromise a distant possibility. 

 In the run-up to today?s talks, official sources in New Delhi reiterated: ?Pakistan?s objections are yet to be substantiated quantitatively from the technical standpoint. This would be the main agenda for the scheduled meeting.?

 Asked if Pakistan had dropped the idea of approaching the World Bank, Mahmood said: ?If it is not resolved through talks, there is a provision in the treaty for that. The effort is to resolve it bilaterally. At the highest level, both Prime Ministers want the issue to be discussed openly and resolved.?

 The Pakistani delegation met Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi before the secretary-level talks began. 

 The nine-member Pakistani team also includes its high commissioner to India Aziz Ahmed Khan and Indus waters commissioner Jamaat Ali Shah. 

 Mahmood said if the talks did not bear fruit, arbitration by the World Bank would be the ?logical end?. 

 Duggal said the talks were ?positive, constructive and focused?. He said there were hopes of a speedy resolution. ?We will give a detailed response to the six technical issues identified in today?s talks,? he said.

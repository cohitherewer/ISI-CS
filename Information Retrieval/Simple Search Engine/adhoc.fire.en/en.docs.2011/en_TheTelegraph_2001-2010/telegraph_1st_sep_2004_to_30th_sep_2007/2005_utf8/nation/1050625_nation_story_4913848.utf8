 Manch lights FDI fire

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 24: The Swadeshi Jagran Manch today announced plans to oppose foreign direct investment in the retail sector and claimed responsibility for the governments caution in opening it up to foreign companies.

 We will organise conventions against introduction of FDI into the retail sector, in the capital of every state, by January. We will start off with a national convention on July 21 in New Delhi, said Abraham Verghese, the Manchs all-India convener.

 Job destruction, Verghese alleged, is a hobby of the Indian government.

 The Manch said only one foreign company ? Shoppright ? had been granted entry into the retail sector (in Mumbai) because of the organisations campaign against the Germany-based company, Metro, in Bangalore. 

 Recently, the Manch won a case against Metro, which had indulged in retail after seeking permission for wholesale marketing.

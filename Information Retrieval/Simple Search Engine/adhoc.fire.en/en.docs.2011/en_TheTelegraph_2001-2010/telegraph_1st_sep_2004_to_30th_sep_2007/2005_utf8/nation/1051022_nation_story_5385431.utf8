 Lost amp; found, but boy picks school over home

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Oct. 21: It needed a rickshaw-puller to give 11-year-old Mohammed Wasim his biggest lesson: that the most precious thing in life is education.

 Now the shopkeepers son, who got lost at the age of four, refuses to go back to his better-off parents for fear they might pull him off school.

 He wants to stay with his foster father Toufiq, a rickshaw-puller, who got him admitted to a madarsa despite his poverty.

 Seven years ago, Wasim had accompanied his grandmother from their home in Mangalhat here to Begum Bazaar, from where he went missing.

 Toufiq found him at Chaderghat, 2 km away. After Wasim spent a few days at the police station, the cops asked the childless rickshaw-puller to take care of the boy.

 Toufiq sent him to a madarsa, where Wasim has already cleared the sixth standard in the Urdu medium. After classes, he helps his foster father load and unload the cargo he ferries from the flower market.

 Last week, life sprang a surprise when a former neighbour recognised him and told his natural parents. Mohammed Khalid rushed to Toufiqs house and demanded his son back.

 Chaderghat police were told and it was agreed that the boy would be handed over at the police station on October 18. But Wasim put his foot down.

 On the appointed date, he told inspector G. Nageswar Rao at the police station that he did not wish to live with his real parents. I want to stay with my abbu (Toufiq) and go to school, he said.

 Wasims mother Shameem tried to cajole him with the sweets, toys and new clothes she had brought for him; but he wouldnt be tempted.

 They wont send me to school; they would make me work in the shop, Wasim told the inspector.

 Toufiq said its up to the boy to decide. He is welcome to go. They can take better care of him. But if he stays with me, I promise to let him study ? at least till matriculation, he told the police.

 The police feel the boy shouldnt be forced to live with his natural parents.

 I told Khalid and Shameem to give him some more time and try and win him over. After all, the boys main complaint against them relates to education. They should convince him, Rao said.

 But Khalid plans to move court seeking Wasims custody. He may get a DNA test done to strengthen his case, though nobody is denying he is the real father.

 Kangaroo tip to curb crib deaths 

 New Delhi: When incubators to keep newborns warm are not within reach, it may be wise to borrow lessons from kangaroos. Neonatology experts in India are advocating kangaroo-mother care as one of the strategies to reduce mortality among newborns, reports our special correspondent.

 Keeping sick newborn babies warm is important, but is sometimes overlooked by parents and health workers, experts with the National Neonatology Forum said on Thursday, releasing a training document that outlines methods of transporting newborns.

 India has an infant mortality rate (deaths before one year) of 60 per 1,000 live births but about 40 per thousand die within the first 30 days, representing a huge proportion of neonatal mortality. Attempts to further decrease infant mortality should focus on reduction of neonatal mortality, said Narayan Mathur, president of the forum.

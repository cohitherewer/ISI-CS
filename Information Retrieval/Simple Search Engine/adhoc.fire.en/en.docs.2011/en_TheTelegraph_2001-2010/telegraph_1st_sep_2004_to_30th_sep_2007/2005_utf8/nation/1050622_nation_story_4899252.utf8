 Amit Jogi

 New Delhi, June 21: The CBI is gearing up to arrest Amit Jogi, son of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, in a murder case.

 After Amits failure to turn up at its headquarters in Delhi, the investigative agency is thinking of moving court for a non-bailable warrant against him, sources said.

 They said the case of Amits involvement in the murder of Chhattisgarh Nationalist Congress Party treasurer Ram Avtar Jaggi in 2003 has become stronger following statements made by two of the accused in front of a magistrate.

 The agency had served a notice on Amit at his residence in Raipur on June 17. He was not in, but Ajit Jogi had assured the visiting officials that his son would appear at the agencys headquarters on June 20. He never did.

 We may give him one more chance to appear, an official said.

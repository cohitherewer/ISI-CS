 Shinde strains at Raj Bhavan leash

 Shinde: Second shot

 New Delhi, June 15: Politics and Raj Bhavan dont mix, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam told governors yesterday. Sushil Kumar Shinde would agree: he wants to get out of the Hyderabad Raj Bhavan and into the thick of active politics.

 The former Maharashtra chief minister, banished to Andhra Pradesh last November after he steered the Congress-led Democratic Front to victory in the Assembly polls, can see an opening for himself, too.

 The death of sports minister Sunil Dutt means a vacancy not only in Parliament but also in the Union cabinet, where a shuffle of portfolios is imminent after Congress president Sonia Gandhi returns from Russia.

 Shinde has set tongues wagging in Delhi by arriving here on Sunday, two days ahead of the two-day governors conference. 

 His objective, apparently, was to secure a meeting with Sonia before she left on her five-day tour of Russia in the early hours of Monday. It could not be confirmed whether he did meet her.

 But, at least, Shinde did get to meet Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel yesterday and press his case for being allowed to quit as governor and return to politics, presumably at the national level.

 This is the second time in less than two months that Shinde has approached the party high command on the subject. On the earlier occasion, he had been eyeing the Rajya Sabha seat left vacant by former Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupams resignation.

 The Nationalist Congress Party, the Congresss partner in Maharashtras Democratic Front government, was willing to endorse Shindes nomination. But the Congress leadership cold-shouldered the former chief ministers plea and left the seat for the NCP, whose nominee, Ashok Chavan, was elected unopposed.

 Now, according to party sources, Shinde wants to contest the Lok Sabha by-election from Sunil Dutts Mumbai North-West constituency. The bypoll, however, is likely to be held only in October-November, together with the Bihar Assembly polls.

 Shinde apparently reckons that if the high command gives him the nod to quit Raj Bhavan now, he can also be a contender for a place in the Union ministry.

 If this doesnt happen, he has another option in mind: the post of a party general secretary as Sonia carries out a long-planned revamp in the All India Congress Committee sometime later this month or early in July.

 Shinde had looked likely to retain his chair as chief minister after leading the Congress to victory in the Assembly elections last year. But after the Congress got NCP chief Sharad Pawar to accept the partys claim to the chair, it suddenly picked Vilasrao Deshmukh as chief minister and packed Shinde off to Hyderabad.

 Nearly two years earlier, Shinde had replaced Deshmukh in the chair.

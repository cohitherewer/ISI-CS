 Mallya gift

 Hyderabad, Aug. 5: The Balaji temple in Tirupati is no stranger to celebrities. Today, it was the turn of industrialist and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Mallya to make an appearance as the annual Brahmotswavam came to a close, reports our special correspondent.

 Mallya (in PTI picture) flew down to Tirupati this morning in his brand new Lear jet along with 23 family members and three vanloads of gifts.

 Mallya, the owner of Kingfisher Airlines, gave 23 sets of 42-inch plasma television worth Rs 30 lakh to the temple and dropped two heavy bundles into the temple hundi.

 A.P.V.N. Sharma, the executive officer of the temple, said the TV sets would be placed in the 8-km-long complex next to the temple to entertain people waiting ? some stand in the queue for more than 48 hours ? for a darshan.

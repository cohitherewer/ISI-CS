 Graft crusader hits verdict hurdle

 - Cases take years to cut backlog

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 2: A fortnight ago, former cooperative secretary Ram Chandra Behera found himself in a vigilance net when anti-corruption sleuths raided his house in Bhubaneswar and other places in Orissa on charges of amassing assets disproportionate to his income.

 During the raid, the sleuths recovered four Mitsubishi Lancer cars worth Rs.38.86 lakh, two Qualis cars worth Rs 17.82 lakh, gold jewellery weighing 412 grams and three houses worth Rs 54 lakh in his possession. The total assets: Rs 1.23crore. 

 But Behera, who never came under chief minister Naveen Patnaik?s shadow of corruption during his long tenure as cooperative secretary, need not worry about spending life behind bars.

 Though the department lodged over 1,000 cases in the past four years following Naveen?s crusade against corruption, verdict has been announced in only a handful of cases in which almost all the accused were acquitted due to lack of evidence. 

 Going by the records of the state vigilance, a new case would take at least 15 years for its verdict to be announced.

 Ever since Naveen came to power, about 600 officials, including IAS, IPS and Indian Forest Service officers have come under the vigilance department scanner. 

 In the past four years, Naveen has sacked powerful ministers, including Nalini Kanta Mohanty, Kamala Das and Prasant Nanda. 

 More than 1,700 cases are pending trial in the four courts of Bhubaneswar, Sambalpur and Berhampur. While the vigilance sleuths lodge anything between 200 and 300 cases annually, the conviction rate remains at 25-30 per cent.

 Though the department manages to file chargesheets in 70 per cent of the cases, only 30 per cent are disposed of every year due to lack of sufficient number of courts. 

 As cases drag on for years, the witnesses and the investigating officers lose interest after a few years of trial resulting in acquittal. 

 In 12 per cent of the cases, the files are closed as the accused dies in the trial stage.

 ?The courts are overburdened with old cases some of them as old as 18 years. Besides, the courts are not exclusively for vigilance cases,? says vigilance director G.C. Nanda. 

 A top vigilance official said, ?Even if no more cases were registered, it would take at least another 20 years to clear the backlog keeping the present disposal rate in mind.?

 Though Naveen promised a special vigilance act and a number of vigilance courts during 2000 Assembly election, not one has come up in past four years.The matter might improve in future with the government sanctioning funds for eight special vigilance courts to come up in different cities of Orissa by 2007.

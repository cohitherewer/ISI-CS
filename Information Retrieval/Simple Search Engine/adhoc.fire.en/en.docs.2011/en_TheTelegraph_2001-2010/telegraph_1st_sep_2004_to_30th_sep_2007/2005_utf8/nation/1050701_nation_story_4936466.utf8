 Singapore push for freer skies

 New Delhi: Singapore has asked India 

 to further liberalise air services between the two countries, 

 reports our correspondent.

 A liberal aviation regime will increase (the number of) foreign visitors and create jobs in the tourism sector. Between Singapore and China, we now have unlimited flights. But between Singapore and India, travellers have great difficulty in getting air tickets. This puts India at a significant disadvantage, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Thursday.

 Delhi has recently liberalised air services with all Asean nations, allowing them to launch more flights. 

 Loong was addressing a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and Assocham.

 He also reiterated Singapores support for Indias claim to permanent membership of the UN Security Council but opposed enlarging veto power, saying it would paralyse decision-making.

 I hope that before too long, we will be able to liberalise air services so that we can generate further spin-offs throughout our economies, he said.

 According to Union commerce minister Kamal Nath, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Loong had discussed the issue on Wednesday. We expect to move forward in this area in a months time, he said.

 Singapore supports Indias bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC. India is a natural candidate, given its size, the population it represents, its growing influence and linkages internationally, said Loong. 

 owever, he added: We should not end up having a situation where we have many vetoes in the UNSC. This will paralyse decision-making process at the UN and undermine the credibility and effectiveness of the institution.

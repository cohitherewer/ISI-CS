 A thank you for sorry Varanasi 

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Varanasi, Aug. 30: When the phone call finally came from Varanasi this afternoon, Gloria Pokar in Germany could only say thank you.

 A police officer had just told the 30-year-old that the two men who had raped her in the temple town four years ago had been punished with life terms.

 All I can say is a big thank you to you, Pokar told investigating officer P.N. Tripathi, who had doggedly seen the case through to its end in her absence.

 What she missed seeing was the apologetic faces of some 50 local tour operators who had thronged the court premises, expecting her to be there, to say sorry.

 But a big sorry would still be reaching Berlin: the district and sessions judge who pronounced the sentence also directed the state to send a written apology to the German government.

 The travel agents, who had waited for hours outside the courtroom for the sentence to be announced, met Tripathi, though. They requested him to pass their apologies on to Pokar for what the rapists ? a hotel owner and a tour guide ? had done to her.

 There are black sheep in every society, and we have some here, too, said Rajiv Kapoor. We want to tell Gloria we are sorry on behalf of the many good people in Varanasi.

 Pokar would have reason to thank the state government, too: it persuaded her to visit Varanasi for a week this January ? all expenses paid ? so that she could identify the accused and testify against them. She did.

 The state government also appointed Tripathi nodal officer in the case, giving him the job of pursuing it to the end and of looking after Pokar on her second trip to Varanasi.

 Pokar was raped on July 15, 2001, in her hotel room. A nurse, she had visited Varanasi in the course of her studies in oriental medicine. 

 She was given lassi laced with sleeping pills and raped brutally by Maniraj Singh and her guide Vinod Singh. Each, apart from serving his jail sentence, must pay her Rs 1 lakh as compensation.

 One of the prosecutors said both the accused had pleaded innocent, saying Pokar had seduced them in a drunken state.

 Many foreign tourists who fall victims to criminals in India never get justice because they refuse to return to testify.

 Varanasi, which holds special attraction for foreign tourists because of its quaint charm and mystical traditions, is also notorious for its sordid mix of crime and decay. In the past 10 years, at least 13 foreign tourists have been targets of criminals.

 In 1998, a Swiss woman, Diana, was raped and murdered. The accused were arrested only to be acquitted because there were no witnesses.

 The state government, worried at the impact Pokars rape could have on tourism, sought to ensure justice.

 Poll panel relaxes recognition rules

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 14: The Election Commission has made it easier for smaller parties to play bigger roles on the national stage.

 It liberalised norms for their recognition at both the state and national levels in an announcement this evening.

 The immediate beneficiaries of the liberalised norms would be parties that could not so far claim a pan-Indian presence like the Samajwadi Party, BSP, NCP, UGDP and possibly even the minor partners in the Left Front.

 The announcement said if a party is recognised by the Election Commission in at least four states, it would be eligible for the status of national party.

 At the state level, a party can claim recognition from the poll panel if it wins in at least one of 25 (or a fraction thereof) Lok Sabha constituencies. It can also claim recognition if its candidates have polled at least six per cent of valid votes polled in all seats and won at least one seat.

 The Election Commission has actually rolled out a menu of options for parties. Todays modifications are only an addition to the choices that parties have in order to claim recognition. The commission has made it clear that parties need fulfil only one of the criteria.

 The panel said the changes have been prompted by its review of the performance of parties in the last Lok Sabha elections. It noticed certain anomalies. Till the norms were changed, the poll panel said, they did not take into account the performance of parties in Lok Sabha elections for state party recognition. 

 In order to remove these anomalies, the Election Commission decided to make some modifications in the recognition conditions and a draft of amendment proposals was circulated among all recognised parties, for their comments by April 30. Many of the political parties submitted their views, the commission said.

 Sonia, Paswan talks add to haze

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Bihar election scene has become even more hazy after Sonia Gandhi?s unscheduled meeting with Ram Vilas Paswan today.

 The Congress chief?s talks invitation to her Lok Janshakti Party counterpart ? soon after her meeting with Laloo Prasad Yadav ? was first interpreted in political circles as the former?s ploy to exert pressure on the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, who is unyielding on seat-sharing in Bihar.

 There was also the buzz that Sonia was trying for a tie-up with the LJP after having failed to convince Laloo Prasad to part with a reasonable number of seats.

 Another explanation doing the rounds was that Sonia was making a last-ditch effort to get Paswan to contest the polls under the banner of the United Progressive Alliance, which includes the RJD.

 ?All allies of the UPA will fight the elections together,? Congress spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan said, expressing the hope that a ?very good picture? would emerge at the end of the seat-sharing talks.

 Asked whether the LJP would be part of such an alliance, she said: ?I am not in a position to rule out anything.?

 LJP sources said Paswan politely rejected Sonia?s suggestion of a UPA umbrella for the polls and repeated his offer of an alliance between their parties with the chief minister?s post going to the Congress.

 The LJP chief declined to divulge Sonia?s response to his offer. Paswan said he apprised Sonia of the political situation in Bihar and assured her that there would be two-thirds majority for their parties? alliance if there was a tie-up.

 Sub-sea Mayday to US

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, March 22: The Indian Navy is pressing for an agreement with the US Navy for a submarine rescue programme within the year. Naval headquarters wants the agreement concluded urgently on humanitarian grounds.

 The ?humanitarian? arrangement to rescue the crew of an Indian submarine if it is in distress will be for a fee. India has paid about $100,000 up front, Vice-Admiral Yashwant Prasad, the vice-chief of the navy, said here today.

 Teams from the Indian and US navies had also surveyed facilities at Mumbai and Chennai airports to de-assemble and re-assemble flyaway kits that the US submarine rescue programme revolves around. At its core, this comprises a deep submersible rescue vehicle (DSRV).

 The navy chief, Admiral Arun Prakash, is currently in the US for talks on the programme. The Indian Navy is also scouting separately for a submarine rescue vehicle that is estimated to cost between Rs 300-400 crore.

 The navy?s submarine arm currently has 16 boats of which two are constantly undergoing refit. Vice-Admiral Prasad said technical modifications had been carried out on the Shishumar (HDW)-class German origin submarines. The modifications will allow a DSRV to marry with the submarine and rescue its crew.

 The US DSRV would be able to rescue the crew of a submarine in distress up to a maximum depth of around 650 metres.

 The navy?s ?silent arm? comprises four Shishumar (HDW)-class submarines (commissioned between 1986 and 1994), 10 Kilo (Russian-origin) submarines, commissioned between 1986 and 2000, and two Foxtrot (obsolete ex-Soviet), commissioned in 1973 and 1974. Vice-Admiral Prasad said technical modifications were being made to the Russian-origin submarines.

 Talks on the submarine rescue programme for the Indian Navy commenced in 1995 but were discontinued in 1999 following India?s nuclear tests. They were revived last year.

 ?US experts are now evaluating the Foxtrot and Kilo-class to recommend alterations that have to be made for deep sea rescue,? he said.

 The agreement envisages that the US Navy will fly its DSRV and ?flyaway kit? to Mumbai or Chennai within 48 hours after being alerted to an Indian submarine in distress. 

 A DSRV would carry a crew of four to eight and would be lowered to the depths of the sea and ?latched? to the submarine through a pressurised chamber. The crew of the submarine would be able to transfer from the boat to the DSRV that would then surface.

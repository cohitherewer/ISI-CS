 Advani lifts cloud on twin hats

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: L.K. Advani has stepped in to scotch speculation in the RSS and the BJP that he would step down as party president after the Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana elections and continue as leader of the Opposition. 

 He has chosen a BJP mouthpiece, Bhajapa Samachar, to clear the air. ?I have not taken over to resign,? said Advani. 

 He told another newspaper that he had assumed the post just before this round of elections, that he did not resign when the BJP was down to just two seats in the Lok Sabha in 1984 and had no intention of doing it now.

 Considerable significance was attached to the fact that Advani chose an in-house journal, rather than a mainstream publication, to set the record straight on the question of his job.

 BJP sources said the background to his statement was the ?rumour? that the RSS was pressuring him to give up one of the two posts he is holding, using ?convention? as an argument.

 The sources said Advani himself was inclined to continue as leader of the Opposition. ?If the UPA falls, the BJP, being the second largest party, would be invited to form an alternative government which he would naturally head,? a BJP source said.

 Asked whether the BJP would have enough numerical support to cobble such an alternative if Advani were to lead it, the source said: ?His logic possibly is if allies like the Janata Dal, the TDP and the Trinamul Congress had no problem with him becoming the deputy Prime Minister, why should they mind if he becomes Prime Minister?? 

 As for non-NDA parties like the Samajwadi Party, whose backing would be crucial in such a scenario, the sources claimed that Mulayam Singh Yadav was ?beholden? to Advani for facilitating his passage to power in Lucknow after the BJP dumped the Mayavati-led government.

 RSS sources said while the sarsanghachalak, K.S. Sudarshan, was not ?entirely comfortable? with an Advani-led BJP, the Sangh?s dilemma stemmed from the lack of an alternative.

 ?The RSS is clear that it does not want any of the second-generation leaders. When the topic was being hotly discussed, there were signals from those close to Advani that if he should go as party chief, either Arun Jaitley or Sushma Swaraj should take his place. The RSS had reservations about this proposal,? said a source.

 The Sangh?s candidates were reportedly Kalyan Singh or Rajnath Singh, the rationale being only a ?popular face? from Uttar Pradesh would resurrect the party?s fortunes. 

 It was only when the Sangh seemed ?reconciled? to the idea of ?allowing? Advani to complete his three-year term that he chose to go public on the issue. 

 The RSS, said the sources, was now asking Advani to ?revamp? his team and induct persons who would do the Sangh ?proud? and not ?appear as bad advertisements?.

 Cong feeler on power share hits DMK wall

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Dec. 11: The Congress has for the first time hinted at a power-sharing pact with the DMK if the southern party wins the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections, but M. Karunanidhi has stonewalled it. 

 Last night, at a forum of the Rajaji Foundation that conferred its first Rajaji award on the DMK chief, National Advisory Council convener Jairam Ramesh sent a subtle feeler in the presence of S. Jaipal Reddy, the Union urban development and culture minister.

 The Congress has been out of power in the state for nearly 40 years now. But it (Congress) is going to be in power here very shortly, Ramesh said.

 The comment from the National Advisory Council member was not lost on the huge gathering. 

 Hailing Kalaignar (man of letters) Karunanidhi as the architect of the UPA, Ramesh said the DMK leader had not only crafted the alliance (before the 2004 Lok Sabha polls) but also gave it a name and shape. 

 India today is in a situation of great competitive politics, but that does not mean you give up personal friendship, decent political dialogue, said Ramesh, adding that this was the most important message of Rajajis life. 

 Ramesh, who represents Andhra Pradesh in the Rajya Sabha, was optimistic that the UPA would continue to function efficiently with Karunanidhis guidance. 

 Union minister Reddy went a step further. He saw the felicitation of Karunanidhi as a symbol of the sangam (confluence) of two different political traditions in Tamil Nadu ? the Congress and the Dravidian.

 Recalling Rajajis stellar role as Bengal governor after Partition when he impressed upon the majority community to infuse confidence in the minorities, Reddy said for Karunanidhi, too, secularism is a creed as it was with Rajaji, who was seen as Gandhijis conscience keeper. 

 The development came on a day the DMK relaunched its political English weekly, the Rising Sun.

 Karunanidhi thanked the Congress leaders profusely for their praise, but was on guard regarding any talk on the power-sharing issue. 

 Stonewalling the offer, the DMK president said: You have called me a sirpi (sculptor) in fashioning an alliance and so on. Yes, I am a sirpi. But I can be an effective sirpi and sculpt something beautiful for you only if you give me the stone and the chisel.

 The PMK, a DMK ally led by S. Ramadoss, is already pressing him with the same matter.

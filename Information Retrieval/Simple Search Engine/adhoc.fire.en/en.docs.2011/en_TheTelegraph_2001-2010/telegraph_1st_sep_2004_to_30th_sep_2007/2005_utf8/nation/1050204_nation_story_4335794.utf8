 Delhi connects with palace

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: India today began its official contact with the new regime in Kathmandu despite the outrage over King Gyanendra?s coup.

 Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, the Indian ambassador, met Ramesh Nath Pandey, Nepal?s new foreign minister, to discuss the situation evolving out of the king?s decision to sack the government, impose emergency and assume power.

 Briefing reporters here, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said the ambassador met Pandey to convey the ?import? of Delhi?s stand on the recent developments in Kathmandu.

 India has in its statements expressed serious concern over the developments and asked for restoration of democracy and release of political leaders arrested by the army since Tuesday.

 Avoiding a direct comment on Delhi?s reaction, Nepal?s ambassador Karna Dhoj Adhikary said here today that bilateral ties would not be affected.

 ?The basic fabric of the relationship between India and Nepal is the recognition of our country?s sovereignty and capability. There is nothing that threatens our relationship,? he said in Kathmandu?s first official reaction since Tuesday?s coup.

 Delhi, despite its strong reservations, has been keen on keeping a line of communication open with the palace, a desire evident in today?s meeting in Kathmandu.

 This first became clear yesterday when foreign secretary Shyam Saran refused to make restoration of democracy a pre-condition for starting a dialogue with Kathmandu?s new regime.

 Nepal is strategically one of India?s most important neighbours. Any negative impact in Nepal ? in this case, a countrywide violent agitation by the Maoists ? can have a spillover effect on India as the countries share a long and porous border.

 Adhikary rejected the fear of ?ramifications? affecting India.

 Delhi, however, is worried that the king?s coup may help the Maoists occupy the space vacated by the democratic forces and launch a countrywide movement against the palace.

 Adhikary contended that the ?main objective? of the king?s action was to ?secure the future of multi-party democracy in the country?. ?There was some confusion initially. But today there is a sense of relief in Nepal,? he said.

 Black Friday 

 New Delhi, Jan. 31 (PTI): The controversial film, Black Friday, based on the 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai, will have to await the verdict of Bombay High Court for its release in theatres as the Supreme Court today dismissed a petition filed by the producers challenging a stay order on screening the movie.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur dismissed the petition filed by Mid-Day Multimedia Ltd and observed that it did not want to interfere in the interim order passed by the high court on January 27.

 The high court had stayed the screening of the movie saying it could influence public opinion though the producers had given an undertaking before the designated Tada court, which is trying the case, to display a disclaimer before screening the film.

 The court had allowed the screening on the undertaking that the disclaimer would clarify that the movie was based on an eponymous book and drop the words a ?true story?.

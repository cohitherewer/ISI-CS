 Breather for Kislay kidnap key suspect

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 1: Patna police today failed to take Chunnu Thakur, key suspect in the Kislay Kaushal abduction, in remand for questioning. 

 Patna chief judicial magistrate Ram Parvesh Choubey rejected the police plea on the ground that they did not have enough evidence to prove the involvement of Thakur in the case.

 Earlier, the police had managed to get a production warrant for Thakur following which they brought him to the city on transit remand last night. They kept Thakur at Sachivalaya police station and allegedly questioned him for a few hours. 

 Raids too were conducted at several places in north Bihar last night, a source said. 

 Thakur has accused the police of targeting him to settle ?political scores? with certain ?forces?. ?My family has been harassed for many years. Police want to see my hand in any crime that takes place in the region,? a source quoted him as saying.

 The city police could file a fresh appeal for the remand of Thakur after gathering more evidence. ?We have sufficient evidence in the case and will approach the court again,? senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan said.

 In Biharsharif and Bhagalpur, the police were still searching for clues to find the whereabouts of the missing students.

 Even as the police try to solve the ?missing? cases, abduction and extortion threats continue to flow in from different parts of the state. Rajeev Kumar of Gyan Bharati School in Darbhanga is allegedly missing from the hostel since yesterday while assistant stationmaster of Sahdei station in the Hajipur- Barauni section, Shashi Bhushan Kumar, was abducted last night from his house in Vaishali district. Kumar is the son of a jeweller.

 Vaishali police today recovered the body of a boy, Raj Narayan, from a bridge on the Ganges. The boy had been missing for two days, a police source said. 

 Vaishali superintendent of police H.N. Deva said the missing girl from Hajipur, Anjali Kumari, has not been abducted and hinted at a possible love angle.

 Bindeshwari Prasad Sah, who is posted as a government doctor in Katihar district, has allegedly received an extortion threat for a huge amount of money.

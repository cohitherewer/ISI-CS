 Trust twist to Ayodhya case

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, April 20: If the Sangh parivar had nursed hopes of taking over land for early construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, a new petition has added a fresh twist to the legal tangle.

 A trust founded in 1893 moved a petition earlier this week in the court of the Faizabad civil judge claiming it was the rightful owner of the entire land in the Sadar tehsil of Faizabad, including the Ayodhya township. The Sri Raj Rajeswari Sita Ram Trust also said the 71.36 acres acquired by the central government under the Ayodhya Act, 1993, also belonged to it.

 ?We have proof to confirm this and hence we pray to act as a trustee body for the land in Ayodhya. The same should therefore be handed over to us,? the petition claimed.

 The court has admitted the suit and served notices to 12 other defendants in the case, including the cabinet secretary, Government of India, and the chief secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh.

 Shivendra Pratap Sahi, the trust?s representative, said he thought an intervention on behalf of the trust was necessary as Sangh parivar bodies have been pressuring the central government to allow them to act as trustee for the land. ?But we are the actual title holder, therefore we should be the rightful owner,? he said.

 Informed sources said the petition has further complicated the legal battle and Hindutva organisations may not find it easy to acquire trusteeship of the land.

 The trust, which is involved with charity work and runs several temples and schools, has based its petition on sections 3 and 7 (2) of the Ayodhya Act. 

 Under these provisions, the 71.36 acres were vested with the central government but any disputed area could be transferred to a party if it is found entitled to that area. Several Hindutva organisations had earlier filed petitions in the Faizabad court staking such claims.

 The act also prohibits any construction activity on the land till the dispute is settled. 

 Ashok Singhal, the chief of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad which blames the previous BJP-led government at the Centre for not trying to expedite the judicial process in the Sangh parivar?s favour, said the petition was an attempt to delay the process further. ?We will furnish our side of the reply to the court later,? he told reporters in Ayodhya. 

 Both the VHP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh have accused Atal Bihari Vajpayee of letting go of a chance to acquire the land during his tenure as Prime Minister.

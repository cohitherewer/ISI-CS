 Comrades give CPM headache 

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, April 8: The CPM is unable to stem the ideological rot that has set in among its cadre, particularly in strongholds Bengal and Kerala.

 The party?s latest draft political organisational report draws attention to the low ideological level of its new recruits. The last such report, adopted three years ago by the Hyderabad party congress, had stressed the same point and called for ?strengthening ideological work?.

 The latest report indicates that the party has not been able to rectify its lapses in Bengal and Kerala. ?In the name of social pressure, many comrades are into obscurantist practices. The party should be vigilant about the danger of caste influence in society and its potential to permeate all organisations,? says the report.

 ?Many new recruits in the party do not know the party?s basic understanding about Indian revolution, the classes and the different sections of the people who are to be part of the people?s democratic front,? it says.

 Last year, the CPM politburo celebrated the birth anniversaries of two important leaders, A.K. Gopalan and B.T. Ranadive, and in the process conducted a two-month ideological campaign.

 But it seems to have been a case of ?too little, too late?. The rot that has seeped into the party is deep. It persists even as party membership is increasing. In Bengal, the CPM membership has gone up from 2,45,026 in 2001 to 2,74,921 in 2004. In Kerala, it has increased from 3,01,562 to 3,16,305. The CPM now claims a total membership of 8,67,763.

 The party leadership is concerned about the new entrants, many of whom, particularly in Bengal, joined the CPM much after the Left Front government came to power in 1977. There is a feeling that the new members are more committed to ?power? than to Marxist ideology.

 The latest report reinforces this. ?A considerable section of party members do not have an adequate understanding of dialectical materialism and are incapable of applying that approach.?

 It says reports from the states show that permanent party schools are functioning in Bengal, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. ?But much more needs to be done in view of the situation and its needs,? the report suggests.

 ?(The) Party should pay much more attention to political, ideological and organisational education of party members,? it adds.

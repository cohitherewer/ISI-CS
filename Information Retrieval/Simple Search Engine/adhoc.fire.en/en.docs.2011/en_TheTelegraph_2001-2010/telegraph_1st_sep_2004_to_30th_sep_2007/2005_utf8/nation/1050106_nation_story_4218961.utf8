 Fine for brand abuse

 New Delhi, Jan. 5 (PTI): Delhi High Court has asked an Indian publisher to pay Rs 16 lakh as damages for illegally using the brand name ?Time?, marking a major judgment relating to intellectual property rights.

 The brand name is owned by the publisher of the international magazine Time.

 Justice R.C. Chopra in an ex parte decree restrained the publisher and printer of Hindi magazine, Time Asia Sanskaran, from publishing it under that title.

 The high court also restrained the domestic publisher from using the component ?Time? in conjunction with any prefix or suffix or from using the trade name ?Time? or ?Time Asia?, and also from imitating the distinctive red-border design on the magazine.

 Railway rules, Lalu style

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 28: Railway minister Lalu Prasads decision to suspend two employees because his special train got delayed near Gopalganj yesterday has evoked a muted protest from other employees of East Central Railway.

 Lalu Prasad was on his way to Gopalganj in connection with the murder of a local RJD leader there. His train was stranded near Bada Gopal station for nearly three hours because the engine of the goods train moving ahead had failed.

 The driver of the train and the chief controller at Sonepur, which had given the green signal to the goods train, were later suspended.

 The goods train was cleared well in advance, taking into account the ministers movement. But we cannot predict a mechanical failure, which can come anytime. This is what happened yesterday and the two employees were suspended for no fault of theirs, said a member of the local railwaymens union, who asked not to be named.

 Another employee recounted a similar incident near Allahabad a few months ago. The officials, during a check, had found some RJD workers travelling without proper tickets. Explanations were sought from them but a few days later penal action was taken against the officials. It was shocking and a protest led to the withdrawal of the suspension orders, he said.

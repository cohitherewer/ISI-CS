 Spurned youth in acid attack 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sambalpur, Feb. 8: An 18-year-old girl has been left scarred for not accepting the marriage proposal of a local youth here.

 The youth, Biswa Rana, allegedly threw acid on the girl last evening at her house and fled. The victim, who comes from a minority community, may lose vision in one of her eyes, family members said. 

 According to police, Rana came to know of the girl through her brother, with whose help he had bought an auto-rickshaw. While the business partnership did not last long, Rana allegedly entered into a relationship with the girl and wanted to marry her. 

 Claiming that the neighbours were aware of the ?affair?, inspector-in-charge of Town police station Gobardhan Sahu said, ?But the girl?s family was against the marriage as the boy was a Hindu and had a criminal background.?

 However, the girl and her family members denied that she had an affair with Rana. ?As Biswa was my brother?s friend, I regarded him as my brother too?, the victim said.

 ?He did such a thing to take revenge on my brother,? she added. 

 Around 8.30 last evening, Rana attacked the girl while she had gone to the latrine, which was just outside the house. The victim screamed in pain and drew the attention of her family members, who rushed her to hospital. The boy managed to escape, police said. 

 Brother-in-law of the girl, Mohammed Zamil, filed an FIR following which the police raided the house of the accused but could not find him. 

 Police said Rana is out on bail in connection with a case under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code.

 Police are conducting raids on the possible hideouts of the accused. They are also on their toes to prevent the situation from taking a communal twist, investigating officer Harihar Nath Sharma said.

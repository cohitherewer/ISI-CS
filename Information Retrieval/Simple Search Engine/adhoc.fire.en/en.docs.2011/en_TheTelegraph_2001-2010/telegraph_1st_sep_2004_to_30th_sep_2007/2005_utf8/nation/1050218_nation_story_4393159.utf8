 Taslima seeks home

 Taslima Nasreen: I love India

 Calcutta/New Delhi, Feb. 17: Taslima Nasreen, who faces death threats from fundamentalist outfits in her home country, today sought Indian citizenship or at least a ?resident permit?.

 The novelist and poet said that she faxed a request to home minister Shivraj Patil this afternoon, while in Delhi on her way back to Calcutta from a book fair in Raipur.

 She is learnt to have gone to Delhi to meet her publisher, Vani Prakashan, which is bringing out the fifth part of her autobiography.

 ?I wrote to the home minister that I write in Bengali and would love to stay in a place where I can speak Bengali and mix with people who understand my language and culture,? Taslima said over phone in Calcutta.

 ?This is very important for a writer and I love Bengal. I am not allowed to enter my own country, Bangladesh. So I will be grateful if I am given Indian citizenship. If this is not possible, then please give me a resident permit, I urged the home minister in my fax message,? she said.

 Home ministry officials did not confirm whether Patil had received the fax but they did say Taslima recently spoke to the minister, seeking an extended stay in India. He is not learnt to have given any specific assurance.

 An official said Taslima was yet to move a formal request for citizenship and the minister may have asked her to make one. ?It will not be possible for anyone to take a decision without studying the case papers,? he added.

 India?s citizenship law stipulates that a foreign national ordinarily needs to live in the country continuously for 12 months before moving an application, and should have stayed for at least nine of the 12 preceding years to be eligible to become a naturalised citizen.

 The Centre, however, can waive the conditions for an applicant who has rendered distinguished service to the cause of science, philosophy, art, literature, world peace or human progress.

 The home ministry under the NDA government is reported to have turned down the writer?s earlier request for an extended stay. She has been coming to India on three- or six-month visas while living in exile in Europe for a decade.

 ?I have to depend on tourist visas. Sometimes, I get a week?s visa, which is not always enough,? Taslima said, explaining her latest decision.

 ?I was not even granted a tourist visa to India between 1994 and 1999. My Bangladeshi passport is invalid because no embassy of my country renews it. I have not visited my country for almost eight years now,? said the writer who holds a European Union passport issued by the Swedish government.

 ?My visa expires in February and I have already applied for a month?s extension,? said Taslima, who came to India this time on November 26.

 Gulbarga, Dec. 18 (PTI): After Bangalore becomes Bengaluru, Gulbarga may be renamed Kalburgi, Mysore Mysuru, Mangalore Mangaluru, Hubli Hubballi and Belgaum Belagavi.

 There were proposals to rename the towns of Karnataka and the state government is considering them, chief minister N. Dharam Singh said today.

 We will support them (the proposals), he said, adding that the proposals will be sent to the Centre for approval after discussion in the state cabinet, which would be held after this weeks zilla and taluk panchayat elections.

 Defending the renaming of Bangalore, he said the proposal came at a meeting of litterateurs on the eve of suvarna Karnataka (golden jubilee of the re-organised state) celebrations.

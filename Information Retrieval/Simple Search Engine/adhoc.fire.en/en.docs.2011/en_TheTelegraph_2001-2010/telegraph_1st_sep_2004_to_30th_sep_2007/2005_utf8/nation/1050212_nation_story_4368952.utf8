 Gutka notice to Delhi

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre, states and Union territories on a petition seeking a ban on mixing magnesium carbonate, a whitening agent which is carcinogenic, in gutka and pan masala.

 The court has asked the Centre to file its response within six weeks.

 The carcinogenic magnesium carbonate affects ?vital? body organs.

 A division bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and Tarun Chatterjee issued the notices while hearing a public interest litigation filed by the Indore Consumer Forum through its secretary, Arif Khan.

 Khan claimed: ?The sale of tobacco (gutka) is in hundreds of thousands of packets a day in the country and the manufacturers of chewing tobacco manufacture and sell adulterated gutka and play with the lives of millions of people.?

 The petitioner contended that though the whitening agents, mixed with tobacco to prepare gutka, have been banned under the provisions of the Food Adulteration Act 1954, ?nearly all leading manufacturers use such chemicals to avoid occurrence of red colour at the time of chewing?.

 One of the leading gutka manufacturers, Dhariwal Manikchand, today sought impleadment in the proceedings. The petitioner?s counsel, senior advocate Mukul Rohtagi, said he did not have any objection to the company being a party in the proceedings.

 The Supreme Court in November lifted on technical grounds a ban on gutka imposed by some states.

 Several state governments had banned gutka, arguing that it damaged health.

 However, the gutka lobby challenged this and said it was unfair that the sale of the product was banned in some states and not in others.

 The apex court had ruled that only the Centre ? and not state governments ? could take the decision to stop the sale of gutka under section 7(4) of the food adulteration act. Gutka is taken orally and is, therefore, technically regarded as a food product.

 The Union health ministry then asked the law ministry to come up with suggestions on how to ban gutka. The law ministry is yet to come up with its suggestions.

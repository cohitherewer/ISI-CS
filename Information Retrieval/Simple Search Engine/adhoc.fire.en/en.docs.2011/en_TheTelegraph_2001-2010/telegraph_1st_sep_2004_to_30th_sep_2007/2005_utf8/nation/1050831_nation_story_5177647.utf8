 Blow to Kurien in Irma tussle

 BASANT RAWAT

 Kurien

Ahmedabad, Aug. 30: Verghese Kurien, the Milkman of India, suffered a legal setback today with a court nullifying his dismissal of K. Pratap Reddy as the director of the Institute of Rural Management, Anand (Irma).

 The tussle in the management institute had assumed wider implications because it was seen as a fallout of a larger fight between Kurien, the architect of the milk revolution in the country, and his one-time prot?g? Amrita Patel for control over the Amul brands parent board.

 Reddy was perceived to be supporting Patels policies, which apparently prompted Kurien, the chairman of the institute, to oust him.

 However, in the final judgment delivered today, Gujarat High Court termed the dismissal order issued five months ago unlawful. 

 Reddys lawyer said the court upheld his contention that only the board of governors had the right to remove a director.

 It will be more of a moral victory for Reddy as his tenure as director is scheduled to come to an end in September. 

 But for Kurien, who refused to comment on the judgment, the setback might mean more trouble as it could embolden his critics to step up the heat. 

 The standoff at the institute had come to a head a couple of months ago when some board members were prevented from entering the campus.

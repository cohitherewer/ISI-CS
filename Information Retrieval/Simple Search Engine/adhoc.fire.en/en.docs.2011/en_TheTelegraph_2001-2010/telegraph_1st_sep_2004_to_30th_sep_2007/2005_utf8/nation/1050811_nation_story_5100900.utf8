 PM handed riot order

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: The Supreme Court has for the first time sent an order to the Prime Minister for action against errant Gujarat police officials in one of the communal riot cases in the state in 2002. 

 A division bench of Justices B.N. Aggarwal and A.K. Mathur also sent the order to Union home minister Shivraj Patil questioning the role of the police in the Naroda-Patia case and expressed displeasure. 

 A copy of the order, asking the state police chief to reply, was sent to the Gujarat chief minister and the governor. 

 On February 28, 2002, 89 people were killed in Naroda-Patia.

 The judges took serious note of the inaction of the police for not arresting an accused, Shashikant, in the case. We really fail to understand in what manner Gujarat police is acting. Either they are in connivance with the accused or thoroughly worthless, the bench said.

 The state director-general of police (DGP), in his report to the court dated February 7, 2005, had said action under Sections 82 and 83 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was being taken to apprehend the accused. 

 The DGP filed another report in March stating that the proclamation under Section 83 of CrPC had already been issued.

 However, the court said: A period of about five months has expired, but we do not know whether any action under Section 83, for attachment of property of the accused, has been taken or not. 

 It referred to a recent communication from the office of the DGP and signed by the additional DGP, pointing out that curiously, nowhere has it been mentioned therein as to whether any such action under Section 83 has been taken or not.

 The bench today directed the registry to send a copy of the order to the governor and chief minister of Gujarat as well as Prime Minister and home minister of India and posted the matter for hearing on August 22.

 It directed the DGP to file an affidavit on the action taken under Section 83 against the accused.

 In case no satisfactory explanation is furnished in the affidavit for not apprehending the accused, on the next date of hearing, the court will consider desirability of directing the DGP, Gujarat, to appear in person, the Supreme Court said.

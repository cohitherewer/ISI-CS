 Andhra truce bid ends in death threat to YSR

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 

 Hyderabad, Feb. 13: The eight-month honeymoon of the Maoist rebels and the Congress government in Andhra Pradesh has ended on a chilling note. 

 The Maoist guerrillas yesterday announced a death warrant against chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, shutting the doors to a peace process that began last October. 

 The declaration came within hours of Reddy?s visit to Guntur district, where the rebels blew up a politician?s house and kidnapped a postmaster in a remote village.

 ?Rajasekhar Reddy has resorted to fake encounters and deceived us after taking advantage of our popular support in the last polls. He cannot escape our wrath in near future,? warned Suresh, leader of a Maoist militia unit in Guntur. 

 On Thursday, Maoist violence in Karnataka had taken a toll of six policemen.

 The fresh burst of guerrilla violence is the outcome of a Left-leaning Congress government?s stand that continued a rigid stand against display of weapons by Maoists during the period of peace negotiations.

 ?There is absolutely no chance for resumption of peace exercise if the Maoists do not give up arms and vouch for democracy,? Reddy said yesterday. ?We cannot begin the second round of peace talks if they refuse to give up arms,? he reiterated.

 In the wake of the fresh violence, the director-general of police has issued a red alert to all police personnel, bureaucrats and politicians to observe the security drill. The government has beefed up security at all important central and state installations and VIP colonies in Hyderabad.

 All the legislators? homes and bungalows have been placed under vigil through CCTV to monitor movement of suspects.

 The rebel leaders had stayed away from peace talks last month following an encounter killing of over a dozen of their comrades by security forces in one day. In retaliation, the rebels killed nearly 20 civilians, including local politicians and some police personnel, over the next one month. 

 The spate of Maoist violence in the northern states facing elections and the explosive situation in the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal have made an impact on the peace talks in Andhra Pradesh, contend Indian police officials.

 Over the last three decades, Maoist violence had taken a toll of over 6,000 people, including 1,000 policemen.

 The peace process that began in October 2004 attracted top Maoist leaders Ramakrishna and Amar to come out of their hideouts to Hyderabad.

 Ramakrishna, alias Akkiraju Hargopal, was recently dropped as the secretary of the Andhra Pradesh unit of the CPI (Maoist) as a result of the abortive peace talks. 

 During the first round of talks, which lasted four days in October 2004, the Maoists demanded distribution of land to the poor, release of arrested comrades and withdrawal of all pending cases.

 The government, however, has failed to meet any of the commitments till date.

 The enraged Maoists are now on the warpath, burning buses, destroying railway stations, houses of politicians and government guesthouses, and killing civilians.

 The Centre has mooted the strategy of forming a unified command and raising a special force to fight the Maoist menace in 10 states.

 Buddha resource plea to PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh, Bhattacharjee

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today urged the Centre to frame a policy on inter-state resource sharing.

 The context for his demand ? it came at a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ? was the refusal of the Jharkhand government to supply iron ore to Bengal, thus blocking the Jindal Group of Industries from setting up a steel plant in the state. 

 If a state says it will not give iron ore or any other resource to another, what will happen to the country? Where does India stand? (The) government should intervene and come out with a clear-cut policy on these matters, he told reporters.

 Bhattacharjee said despite meetings with his Jharkhand counterpart Arjun Munda and sending to the state top officials of the Jindal group, which owns a steel plant in West Midnapore district, the problem still remains.

 While Munda could not be contacted, his predecessor Babulal Marandi said the state could do nothing in the matter. 

 The state government does not own iron-ore mines. The owners are Tatas, SAIL (Steel Authority of India Ltd) and private parties. I understand Tatas use much of the resources for its own purpose. 

 Of SAIL, I know nothing since it is under the Centre while the private parties largely export their produce. What can the chief minister do in such a case? Marandi asked.

 The Bengal chief minister also sought central assistance for a fifth port near Sagar Island to cope with the growing volume of trade with Southeast Asia. 

 Singh reportedly assured Bhattacharjee that he would speak to the Planning Commission. Shipping and surface transport minister T.R. Baalu was present at the meeting. 

 The third item on Bhattacharjees wish list was updating names on the below poverty line list on the basis of the 2002 census.

 Bhattacharjee invited Singh to visit Calcutta in December for the CII summit and the All India Engineers Conference. Both are expected to happen back-to-back.

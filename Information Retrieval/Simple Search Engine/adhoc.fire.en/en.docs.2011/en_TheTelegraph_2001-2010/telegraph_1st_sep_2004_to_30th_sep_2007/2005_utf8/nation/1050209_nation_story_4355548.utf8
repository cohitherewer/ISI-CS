 Lost eyes of the storm

 Port Blair, Feb. 8: When the tsunami swept everything away early one Sunday morning, it also snatched the visual crutch of an estimated 1,500 people.

 Without glasses, the old are unable to move around and the young can?t study. Now, government doctors and a voluntary group have come together to help survivors see the world around them better, even if their futures are still shrouded in a haze of uncertainty.

 Ophthalmologist Rohindra Lall?s team from the G.B. Pant government hospital, supported by Action Aid, will be prescribing, making and distributing spectacles free to the affected people.

 ?We have the technical set-up to examine all the patients and local companies have been contacted to make them (spectacles),? says Lall. Teams have been visiting the relief camps situated in Port Blair and will soon travel to the Nicobar group to examine inmates of camps there.

 A few days after the tsunami, eye check-up started at camps, with a few operations also conducted at the hospital. ?We expected this problem to arise eventually, but we were waiting for things to settle down, in terms of provision of basic needs,? adds Lall, deputy director, ophthalmology, Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 Over 30 people from the Nirmala School camp have been given glasses. ?On December 31, I saw an old man trying to walk down the stairs on the premises. He was struggling as he couldn?t see anything,? says Father Albinus Barla. He took those who had lost their glasses or were having eye trouble to G.B. Pant Hospital. There are at least 35 more among the remaining 890 refugees in the camp who require visual aids.

 The islanders may feel this problem more acutely than in some parts of the mainland. ?Here, with the high literacy level, more people can read,? says Action Aid?s Shrirang Dhavale. The literacy rate in Andaman is 81.18 per cent; in Nicobar, it is 72 per cent.

 The need for spectacles arose in the Nicobar group in the 90s, recalls Lall, when adult education drives started. Tribals, he adds, who engage in near-vision tasks such as basket and mat weaving, would also suffer, as would fishermen who knit nets.

 To cover all those affected could take up to three months, he feels. 

 Vision problems could worsen if refugees living primarily on rice and dal do not regularly take vitamin A supplements, Lall cautions. 

 ?The camps are providing vitamins, but one must be careful as deficiency caused by malnutrition and diarrhoea can lead to night blindness, cornea problems and even permanent blindness.?

 Tsunami gauge shows bite marks 

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Chennai, Feb. 22: Scientists scoured the oceans, particularly near the areas worst affected by the December 26 tsunami, for 36 days and found that several spots along the eastern coast have subsided by at least a metre. 

 ?One thing is clear. In many places, there has been a subsidence of one metre or more and it is clearly documented on the tide gauge in Port Blair, the jetty there and also in Chennai harbour,? said Dr Harsh K. Gupta, secretary of the central Department of Ocean Development. 

 He was speaking on board the research vessel Sagar Kanya after it returned to Chennai with 31 scientists who were studying the impact of the tsunami on marine, geo-physical, biological and other aspects of the environment. 

 The phenomenon was pronounced in the southern Andamans, with the ?maximum down throw? at its tip, Indira Point. In an opposite reaction, the land level in the north had gone up by 0.8 metre. 

 On the mainland, the inner harbour at Chennai had become a metre deeper. The entry point has sunk two metres. 

 Dwelling on the various components of the proposed national tsunami warning system, Dr Gupta said implementation of the Rs 125-crore project has begun and his department planned to complete it in the next 30 months. 

 Dr Gupta said the Andamans and Tamil Nadu on the east and Gujarat on the west are the only areas in India that face the threat of tsunamis generated by undersea quakes at fault lines running off their coast (see chart). 

 With the two tsunami-prone areas identified, the next task was to have a ?near real-time monitoring of earthquakes, so that as soon as a quake occurs, we know that a tsunami may be generated?. 

 In the vicinity of the fault lines, a ?pressure transducer? ? to differentiate between a tsunami and a normal wave ? and recorders would be placed on the seabed to sense if a quake surge is being generated. 

 Dr Gupta said the sea level has not gone up after the tsunami. The scientists will have to submit their final conclusions in the next three to six months, said Dr Gupta.

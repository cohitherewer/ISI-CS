 Mumbai, Nov. 9: Gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli is in the eye of a storm again after a businessman complained to police that the Independent MLA from central Mumbai extorted Rs 20 lakh from him to settle a dispute.

 Mumbai police raided Gawlis den at Dagdi Chawl in Byculla late last night to look for him and key associate Sunil Ghate, but failed to find them. Heavily guarded by his henchmen, Dagdi Chawl with its many hidden doors and hiding places has long been a headache for the police.

 Raids on Gawlis various hideouts continued today, but there was no trace of him till evening. Sources close to the MLA said he was in the process of filing an anticipatory bail petition.

 Deputy commissioner (crime) D. Kamlakar said: An extortion complaint was lodged at Agripada police station by hotelier Shakeel Ahmed, naming Gawli and six of his henchmen, including local corporator Sunil Ghate. We are investigating the matter. 

 Ahmed said in his complaint that Gawlis henchmen had extorted Rs 20 lakh from him to settle a property dispute.

 The MLA was in the news recently when starlet Preeti Jain was arrested by Agripada police on charges of plotting to kill film-maker Madhur Bhandarkar. The police said Jain had paid Rs 70,000 to Gawlis associate, Naresh Pardeshi, to execute the murder. Gawli was questioned in the case, but was not arrested.

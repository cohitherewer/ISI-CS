 Suicide note blames teachers

 bhubaneswar (PTI): A final-year commerce student of B.J.B. Autonomous College here committed suicide on Friday, leaving a note in which she held three teachers responsible for her death.

 The note also alleged that she was given poor marks in several papers for not taking tuition from them despite being asked to do so, police said. 

 The girl hanged herself from a ceiling fan in her house in Ouat colony. 

 Students of the college staged a dharna in front of the institute on Saturday. They also obstructed traffic on the busy Cuttack-Puri road for some time. 

 The principal of the college, R.P. Ruth, described the charge as baseless. 

 Superintendent of police Amitabh Thakur said the suicide note was being examined. If the handwriting matches, the investigation will proceed, he added. 

 False alarm grounds flight

 Full emergency was declared at the airport. Fire tenders and ambulances were rushed to the tarmac.

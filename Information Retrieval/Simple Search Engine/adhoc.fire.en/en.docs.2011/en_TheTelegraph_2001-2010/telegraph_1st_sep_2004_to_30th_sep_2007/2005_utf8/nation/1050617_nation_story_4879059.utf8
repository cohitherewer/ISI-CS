 Atal note of dissent

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 16: Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani saw his Pakistan trip as a part of the Centres peace initiative. Now Atal Bihari Vajpayee has suddenly blown apart the appearance of consensus between the government and the BJP on the progress of that initiative.

 The former Prime Minister has told his successor Manmohan Singh that the peace process the National Democratic Alliance government had started has become Kashmir-centric and is proceeding along the lines Pakistan wants it to.

 In a letter dated June 15 ? copies of which were given to the press today ? Vajpayee virtually accuses the United Progressive Alliance government of bungling the peace process.

 With great efforts and a sustained strategy, Pakistan was made to commit to a comprehensive process of normalisation leading to the joint statement of January 6, 2004 (the outcome of a meeting between Vajpayee and President Pervez Musharraf). But it seems that the peace process has now become Kashmir-centric, an objective cherished by the establishment in Pakistan, Vajpayee tells Singh.

 The letter was described by BJP leader Yashwant Sinha as reflecting the view of the BJP on the peace process and the manner in which it was conducted.

 The letter was drafted after Vajpayee consulted whoever he had to, Sinha said. Asked if Advani was consulted, he kept mum.

 Vajpayee cites three developments to make his point: the prominence given by Islamabad to the All Parties Hurriyat Conference as against the democratically elected government of Jammu and Kashmir; the manner in which New Delhi mishandled the Hurriyat visit to Pakistan and the way in which it was allowing Pakistan to slip out of the commitments made in the 2004 statement.

 The statement had enshrined four commitments: that violence would be prevented; that Pakistan would not support terrorism from its soil; that a composite dialogue would be held within an established framework; and that there would be no third-party intervention.

 Events of the last fortnight show that once again Pakistan is reviving and keeping open the options of incorporation of Kashmir through violence, through independence or through autonomy/self-governance, the letter says.

 It alleges that the Hurriyat visit held our country to mockery because of the way the passport issue was mishandled by New Delhi. Also, the growing demand for trilateral talks, international guarantee for settlement and including Hurriyat as a representative of the people of Kashmir, seem to be undoing the laboured achievements of the past few years.

 Sinha and Arun Shourie wrote the first draft whose tone was combative, prompting Vajpayee to ask Brajesh Mishra, former national security adviser, to soften it.

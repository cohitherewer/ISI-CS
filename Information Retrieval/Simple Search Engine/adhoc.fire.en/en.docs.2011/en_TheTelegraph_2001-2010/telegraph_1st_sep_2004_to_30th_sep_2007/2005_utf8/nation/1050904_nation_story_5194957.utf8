 Masjid squatters told to clear out 

 New Delhi (PTI): Civic authorities have directed all squatters in and around Jama Masjid to vacate the area in a week, failing which the illegal structures will be demolished.

 The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has served notices on 302 squatters in and around the mosque, said a civic body spokesperson. 

 The MCD undertook the anti-encroachment drive after a directive from Delhi High Court.

 Last month, the court set the deadline of September 15 for removing all the illegal structures in and around the mosque. It directed the MCD, the Delhi Development Authority, the commissioner of police and the area subdivisional magistrate to implement the order.

 The MCD spokesperson said if the illegal squatters do not comply with the notice, they will be forcibly removed and the encroachments demolished. The exercise is part of the process to decongest old Delhi. 

 August tourist tide to Nepal 

 Kathmandu (PTI): Nepal has registered 

 a record growth of 80 per cent in Indian tourist arrivals

 Of the total 25,974 tourists who visited the Himalayan kingdom in August, 10,703 were Indian as compared to last years 5,960, said the latest figures released by the Nepal Tourism Board. The record growth pushed up the total tourist arrival by 16.4 per cent last month.

 Professor penalty

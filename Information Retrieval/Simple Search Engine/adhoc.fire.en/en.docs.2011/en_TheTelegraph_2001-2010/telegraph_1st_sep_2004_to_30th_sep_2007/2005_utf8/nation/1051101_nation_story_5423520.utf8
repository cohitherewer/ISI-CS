 Marine invasion threat from exotic weed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: An exotic seaweed introduced on Indias southern coast a decade ago to serve as raw material for the food processing industry now threatens to invade the Gulf of Mannar and displace its natural biodiversity.

 Scientist divers from the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in Goa have found that the marine algae, Kappaphycus alvarezii, has started spreading near the coastal town of Mandapan on the Gulf of Mannar, NIO scientists have said.

 This exotic species is on the verge of becoming invasive in southern India, the scientists said in a report just published in the journal, Current Science. Were looking at the possibility of bio-invasion of the Gulf of Mannar by an exotic marine algae, Xivanand Verlecar, a senior scientist at the biological oceanography division at the NIO told The Telegraph.

 Verlecar said the Kappaphycus algae, a native of Indonesia and Philippines, was introduced in India in 1995 for cultivation. The algae is grown along the coast and harvested for use in the production of carrageenan, a natural food-grade material that has wide applications in the food processing and other industries. Carrageenan is used in desserts, ice creams, milk shakes, as well as in toothpastes and shoe polish.

 A leading soft drink manufacturer had initially teamed up with the Central Salt and Marine Research Institute to cultivate Kappaphycus on 100 hectares of the coastal area for carrageenan production, aiming for a yield of 100 tons per hectare.

 Local fisherfolk in the Mandapan region have also taken up commercial cultivation of the algae. While algae cultivation is potentially lucrative for the fisherfolk, NIO scientists said, the algae appears to have begun to displace other marine plants in the area.

 Young fish use marine algae as food and various species of fish have specific preferences for algae, Verlecar said. There is need to protect native biodiversity. In the long run, Kappaphycus invasion could affect local fish population.

 The NIO scientists have called for steps to prevent massive invasion by Kappaphycus. In the past, bio-invasive movements and growth of marine species have been known to have threatened native species. A green algae from the tropics that was dumped in the Mediterranean has spread over a substantial area of the Mediterranean sea and caused loss of local seaweed there.

 Free-living Kappaphycus itself has had adverse impacts on corals in Hawaii.

 Reform, Sonia style

 New Delhi, March 28: Sonia Gandhi has underlined the primacy of economic reforms while stressing that ?Congress ka haath aam aadmi ke saath is our aim?.

 However, it is not clear whether she was seeking to ?correct a wrong public perception? ? as some party leaders would say ? about its commitment to reform policies, an understanding prompted by the ?aam aadmi? catchword used in the last general elections.

 ?This (common minimum) programme is committed to the middle path. We have tried to balance the demands of economic reform while keeping the common man at the forefront,? Sonia has written in a signed message to workers in the latest issue of the party mouthpiece, Congress Sandesh.

 Sonia, much like former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, who kept referring to the middle path as his government initiated reform policies one by one, underlined the importance of reforms even as she spoke of the Congress?s commitment to eradicating poverty.

 The Congress president elaborated on the pro-reform middle path and said it was important not to curtail entrepreneurial spirit.

 ?India is poised to become one of the leading economies of the world and for that it needs to ensure that its government follows policies that lead to the widest dissemination of the fruits of economic growth and at the same time implements policies that allow us to compete adequately with the opportunities being provided by the world market,? she said.

 Sonia praised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram for showing the government?s commitment to the middle-path common minimum programme document through the Congress-led coalition?s first full-fledged budget.

 The Congress president also sounded words of caution about the government?s spending on pro-poor programmes. ?We have initiated many programmes for the poor...(but) it is our duty to ensure that these are implemented so that policy actually translates into practice.?

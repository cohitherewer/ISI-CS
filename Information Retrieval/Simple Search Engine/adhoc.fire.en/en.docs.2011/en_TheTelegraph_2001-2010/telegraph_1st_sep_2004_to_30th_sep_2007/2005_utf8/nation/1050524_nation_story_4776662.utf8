 Blast kills five

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, May 23: Five jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed and seven others injured when suspected Communist Party of India (Maoist) activists blew up their vehicle this morning near Jangla in Bijapur police district.

 A group of CRPF jawans was on its way to Bhopalpatnam ? a Maoist-hit pocket ? when a landmine went off around 10.30 am at a place almost 450 km from here.

 The vehicle was thrown up in the air following the explosion. When it landed, Maoists hiding near the spot started firing indiscriminately. Some of the injured security personnel immediately took positions and retaliated. 

 The exchange of fire lasted about two hours before the Maoists fled the spot.

 On receiving information, jawans from Bijapur and Bhopalpatnam were rushed to the spot. A helicopter from Jagdalpur, about 300 km form the capital, was also sent to lift the injured jawans. Nayak said three of the seven injured jawans, who have been admitted to Maharani Hospital in Jagdalpur, were in a critical state. 

 Sources said the attack was carried out to avenge the killing of three Maoists, including two women, when the rebels had attacked a security camp at Dhourai in Narayanpur police district last week. The impact of the blast was so severe that five jawans were killed on the spot, inspector-general of police (Bastar range) Girdhari Nayak told The Telegraph. He added that more than 150 Maoists took part in the attack. The rebels who executed the operation carried sophisticated weapons and wore military uniform.

 Delhi security net for Id

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: Donning a spotless white kurta-pyjama and a skull cap, Mohammed Idris came out from Jama Masjid after saying his Id prayers. A devout Muslim in his middle age, he prayed for the well being of his countrymen and for peace.

 We are going through torrid times, our country needs special blessings from the Almighty. While saying prayers, I and many of my friends had the Delhi blasts at the back of our minds today. I hope good sense will prevail over evil minds from this pious day of Id, said Idris, manoeuvring through metal detectors on his way to the Matia Mahal bazaar.

 He has a busy day ahead. After picking kebabs from Al Jawahar and sweets from the famous Durga Sweet Shop, he would visit friends and relatives.

 At 2.30 pm, the congregation of namazis around Jama Masjid is gradually thinning. Policemen and personnel of the Rapid Action Force are also getting into a relaxed mood.

 For the past one week, since the day of the serial blasts, they were asked to perform the difficult duty of watching out for suspicious persons, things and vehicles while allowing free movement of people through the narrow and crowded lanes.

 A senior officer of Delhi police said the security arrangements in the wake of the serial blasts were unprecedented. The five police stations located in the walled city were given strict instructions to take all possible measures to prevent any untoward incident.

 Policemen were positioned at 50-odd locations in such a way that every person was automatically searched at least three or four times on his way to Jama Masjid. Besides this, random checking of anybody looking suspicious was also being done, said S.S. Manan, assistant police commissioner, Daryaganj.

 Apart from drawing personnel from the five thanas and other districts, Delhi police got five additional companies from the CRPF and the BSF. Policemen with automatic guns were posted at strategic locations on rooftops. 

 Manan said the newly acquired wireless integrated public address system (Wipas) also played a crucial role in managing and sensitising the crowd. 

 With the help of Wipas, a police officer can make a public announcement to a number of locations simultaneously. Delhi police have put Wipas in 40 markets across Delhi.

 The walled city has been given 23 Wipas sets and they have proved to be a boon. They have helped us in making ordinary citizens proactive about their duty towards the society, said Giriraj Singh, station house officer of Matia Mahal police station.

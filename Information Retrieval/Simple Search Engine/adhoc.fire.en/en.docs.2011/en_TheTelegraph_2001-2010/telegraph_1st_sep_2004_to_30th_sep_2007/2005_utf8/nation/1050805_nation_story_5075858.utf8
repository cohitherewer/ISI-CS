 Army spares boy militant

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Aug. 4: They could have easily shot him like his fellow rebels. But the soldiers chose to take the boy alive.

 Army troops, often blamed for being trigger-happy in this rebellion-racked region, captured a 15-year-old militant after a chase in Jammus Udhampur district though they had enough time to put a bullet through him.

 This incident brings forth the human face of the armed forces. The troops are not always out to kill a militant provided they are left with other options, a spokesman for the army said about the Tuesday capture.

 The extreme restraint, as the spokesman put it, appeared to be a fallout of the July 24 episode in Bangargund in Kupwara when the army killed three boys mistaking them for militants. The boys ? aged 11, 12 and 16 ? were on their way to a wedding reception late in the night when they walked into the ambush laid for militants.

 About Tuesdays encounter, the army spokesman said troops of the Sikh Regiment launched a joint operation with police on August 2 about 1230 hours.

 A cordon was laid around the area where the militants were embedded in a dhok or summer hut of nomadic tribes.

 When the noose was tightened, the militants retaliated and fired indiscriminately while running into a maize field. The troops chose to capture the rebels rather than shooting them down. The militants felt the heat and once again popped up and fired. 

 At this stage, a sniper took on the two militants and killed them instantly. One of the rebels was later identified as Abu Shahid, a dreaded militant in Udhampur, while the identity of the other is yet to be established, the spokesman said.

 The third militant, aged 15, ran in panic after his fellow militants were felled. The troops, realising the boy was unarmed, chased him and caught him alive. The operation, in the hills of Mahore, was over in half an hour.

 A spokesman for the army said more and more children are being recruited by militants, who often force them to join their ranks. There have been instances when children have themselves fallen victims to the bombs they were handed over to plant on roads, sources said.

 They recalled the plight of two children ? Mohammad Akram and Tahira ? who were severely injured while handling the explosives they were given by militants to plant in Poonch district. 

 An investigation revealed that the two were forced to carry these explosive devices to plant on the roads the troops use.

 The worst was the case of a mentally challenged person, Showkat Hussain, who was killed in an explosion. He had been handed an explosive device to plant.

 Militants only know how to kill people and it matters little whether the victims are children or mentally challenged, said a source.

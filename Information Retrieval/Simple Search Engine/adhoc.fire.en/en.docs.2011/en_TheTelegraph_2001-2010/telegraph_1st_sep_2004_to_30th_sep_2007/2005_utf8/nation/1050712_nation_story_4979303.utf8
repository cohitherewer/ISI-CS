 Visa breather for foreign students

 new delhi (PTI): 

 Foreign students wishing to study in India can now avail 

 of a more user-friendly visa regime, the government announced 

 on Monday.

 Under the liberalised visa regime, there will be no bar or restriction on the number of courses a foreign student may like to pursue and each time the periodicity of the student visa will be counted afresh.

 The foreign students will be allowed to take multiple courses in one or several institutions if they are recognised or reputed.

 The state government and foreign regional registration offices have been empowered to give student visa within the parameters of simplified regulations.

 With the expansion of the education sector in India, there has been an increasing demand on the educational facilities available in the country from abroad and a need was felt to ease the existing student visa regime, government sources said. 

 Youth poses as Isro ace

 ahmedabad 

 (PTI): A youth from Gandhinagar town has been arrested for 

 duping several people, including a teenaged girl, by posing 

 to be a senior scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation 

 and also a member of the multi-crore moon mission, Chandrayan.

 Harshal Parikh, 19, had created a sensation some months ago by making several claims, including that he was a member of the moon mission, an Isro director, a senior official of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, apart from being a close friend of President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 Parikh was arrested on Sunday and several fake certificates with signatures and official seals claiming that he was a high-ranking government official, were seized.

 The youth had also lured with his false claims a teenaged girl into marrying him. However, she soon realised the facts and informed her parents and police.

 When confronted, Parikh filed a writ petition in Gujarat High Court alleging that the police were harassing him and trying to extract information about the moon mission and other scientific projects.

 Investigating officials said when Parikhs fraud was exposed, some government officials, whom he had met earlier, had called the police saying they had made a mistake as he was a brilliant young scientist.

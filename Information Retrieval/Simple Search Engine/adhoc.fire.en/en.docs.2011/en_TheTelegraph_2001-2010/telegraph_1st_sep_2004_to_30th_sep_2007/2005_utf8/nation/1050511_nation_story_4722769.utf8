 PC pledges Centaur action

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 10: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today assured the Rajya Sabha the Centre would soon take action on the underselling of the Mumbai-based Centaur hotels as pointed out by the CAG report.

 ?We are considering the report and I will, as soon as possible, indicate what we will do,? he said, trying to calm agitated legislators.

 But he gave no indication whether investigations would be carried out by the CBI ? as demanded by the UPAs Left allies ? or if he had a specialised financial investigating agency in mind.

 Although the Opposition BJP benches were empty, the Left parties kept up the pressure on Chidambaram. They repeatedly asked what action the government would take as the CAG findings had confirmed what had been suspected during the NDA regime.

 ?Now that the report has come out, the finance minister must spell out immediately the governments response,? the Left members were heard shouting.

 The CPM reiterated its demand for a CBI inquiry and asked Chidambaram to take a firm stand. In the Lok Sabha, Basudev Acharya said ?irregularities? committed during the divestment of the hotels should be thoroughly probed by the CBI.

 Acharya and party colleague Roop Chand Pal reminded Chidambaram he had said on May 4 he would take action after receiving the CAG report.

 Mallya for Tipu treasures

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, May 18: Last year, the sword of Tipu Sultan flashed in his hands. Next week, he will bid for other treasures of the man known as the Tiger of Mysore.

 A passion for things that were part of the intrepid 18th century rulers life will take business baron Vijay Mallya to London again ? to bid for the royal collection on May 25.

 As a proud Indian, I intend to purchase as many of these treasures as possible, Mallya said in a statement from San Francisco. To avoid controversy, he plans to consult Union finance minister P. Chidambaram on procedures concerning import of antiques.

 The sword, which was among the artefacts shipped to London after Tipu Sultans death on May 4, 1799, at the end of the fourth Anglo-Mysore war, was unsheathed at a rally of Janata Party workers here on the eve of last years elections. The 3.5-foot-long sword made of gold, its scabbard studded with precious stones, was picked up at an auction in London for Rs 1.6 crore.

 It was on display for a week at Srirangapatnam, Tipu Sultans capital near Mysore, to mark his death anniversary.

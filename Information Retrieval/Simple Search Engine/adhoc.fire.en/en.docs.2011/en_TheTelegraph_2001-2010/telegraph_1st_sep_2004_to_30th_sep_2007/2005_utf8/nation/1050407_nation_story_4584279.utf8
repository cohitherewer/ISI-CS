 Much-married NRI tracked at wedding

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, April 6: Raj Bikram Singh had just got married to Satinder Kaur at Hoshiarpur when the family of Dilraj Kaur, a girl he had married two years ago, tracked him down.

 Bikram, a Canadian resident, waved them away, saying he had divorced Dilraj. Her father Dalbir Singh insisted he had not.

 Dalbir, a resident of Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh, also alleged that Bikram had married two more girls. He said Dilraj was married to the man on June 16, 2003. ?He left for Canada on July 7 the same year. For about two weeks he kept calling her up. Then the calls stopped.?

 The family later found out that Dilraj was not his first wife. He had married a Canadian resident earlier to secure entry into that country. Between Dilraj and Satinder, Bikram had taken another wife in Phagwara, Dalbir alleged. 

 ?He has cheated us. He got married to Satinder Kaur of Noor Talai village here on March 31. There was another marriage on March 12 and he spent his honeymoon in the same hotel. We also have information from one of his relatives of yet another marriage that lasted only one day. That was aimed at getting Canadian citizenship only,? he said.

 Bikram was unrepentant, saying he could marry as many times as he liked. ?Sex is my birthright,? he shouted at Dalbir. His father Harpritam backed the claim that Bikram had divorced Dilraj.

 Dilraj?s family then filed a police complaint. But Bikram?s newest in-laws came to his rescue and helped work out a ?compromise?.

 ?We don?t want to file a case against him as he has become our son-in-law. We want the matter to be settled amicably. Bikram can give some money to Dilraj,? said Satinder?s father Gurdial Singh.

 The police, instead of registering a case against Bikram, nodded in agreement.

 ?Dilraj?s wedding took place in Pilibhit. So the case should have been registered there. Moreover, both parties have agreed to a compromise. The matter ends there,? said Hoshiarpur SSP Lok Nath Angra.

 Dilraj is one of about 15,000 girls in Punjab who have married an NRI only to be abandoned, according to Balwant Singh Ramoowalia, whose Lok Bhalai Party has been running a campaign on the issue.

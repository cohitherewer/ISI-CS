 Fast court heat on Centre

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 28: Taking serious note of reports that fast-track courts may not be ?operational? beyond March 31, the Supreme Court today directed the Centre to clarify in two days what it intended to do with them.

 Observing that the work done by the courts ? they were constituted in 2001 for the speedy disposal of over 2.5 crore cases pending in various courts ? over the past four years had been ?good?, Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia asked the Centre to file its response by Wednesday.

 Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati told the judges he would discuss the matter with finance minister P. Chidambaram and get back to them. The 11th Finance Commission had allocated funds for the courts but the 12th did not, giving rise to speculation that over 1,700 such courts would be closed down by April 1.

 The government had on March 14 informed the Rajya Sabha that the 12th Finance Commission was requested to provide funds for the courts but the commission had made no allocation.

 The Supreme Court today cleared all hurdles in the way of setting up fast-track courts in all states, including ?at least one court in every district?, by disposing of a challenge to their constitutional validity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Seeds of Delhis green miracle

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Its enough to turn Calcutta or Chennai green with envy.

 Delhi has increased its forest and tree cover by over 80 per cent in two years at a time when other states and cities are struggling to ensure theirs dont decrease.

 Its all manmade, said a beaming Prodipto Ghosh, secretary, Union environment and forests ministry.

 Along with the government, a leading part has been played by voluntary groups, with schoolchildren and ex-servicemen at the forefront.

 The State of Forest 2003 report says Delhi, which had only 15 sq km of forest cover in 1987, now has 170 sq km. Against this, Calcutta has hardly any forest cover (the government has no figures) while Chennai has one as low as 6 sq km. Only Bangalore, with 168 sq km, and Mumbai, with 87 sq km, stand comparison.

 The national capitals verdancy isnt restricted to select areas like Lodhi Garden, the walkers paradise billed by Time magazine as one of the best urban oases in the world. The green miracle extends almost across the city.

 The VIP zone in Lutyenss Delhi has 41.66 per cent of its area under green (forest and tree) cover. It is followed by posh south Delhi with 31.60 per cent and central Delhi with 21.07 per cent. The average across the city is 18.07 per cent.

 Unlike the Northeast, where the climate makes it possible for forests to regenerate fast, Delhi owes its greenery to constant and widespread efforts.

 Among the campaign leaders are the Territorial Armys ecological task force ? which reclaimed the Bhatti Mines area and planted 500,000 saplings ? the eco clubs at 1,600 schools and the 4,000 resident welfare associations.

 The government departments have helped by enforcing Delhis Tree Preservation Act, which bans the chopping of a single tree without permission, and by renewing the Greening Delhi Action Plan annually for the last five years.

 The success of the Green Delhi campaign lies in the gram sabha land that has been turned into forests, particularly in south-west Delhi, said Naini Jayaseelan, secretary, environment, Delhi.

 In east Delhi, the performance has been poor because most of the area is already built up and it is difficult to find land to develop tree or forest cover.

 The government is developing and managing at least 14 city forests over acres of land in south-west, north-west and north-east Delhi.

 The Supreme Court ban on colonisation of the Ridge area and directions to remove encroachments has helped.

 The Territorial Armys ecological task force has developed the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary in the south-eastern part of the Ridge as a manmade sanctuary. Its head, Colonel S.K. Parikh, said: We have tried to stop the mining and reclaim the area for plantation. The green cover is being developed and new spaces have been planted with indigenous species. The entire job has been done by ex-servicemen.

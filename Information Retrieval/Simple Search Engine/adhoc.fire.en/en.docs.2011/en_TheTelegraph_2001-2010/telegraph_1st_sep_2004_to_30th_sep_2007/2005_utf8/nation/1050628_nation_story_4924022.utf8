 Allies bicker over dance bar ban

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 27: The bar brawl doesnt seem to end. The bickering between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party ? coalition partners in the Democratic Front government in Maharashtra ? came to the fore today over the dance bar ordinance.

 Maharashtra Congress president Prabha Rau today said chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had not consulted the party over the ordinance banning dance bars in the state. It is the duty of the government to consult the party on issues that affect society.

 Rau said the state Congress would discuss with Deshmukh, when he returns from his 19-day US tour on July 2, why the party was not consulted formally. She said the government has to consider the impact of such policy decisions on society before they are taken.

 The decision to impose a ban on dance bars in Maharashtra was announced by NCP leader and Deshmukhs deputy, R.R. Patil, on March 30 in the Assembly during the budget session of the legislature, sparking a controversy that refuses to die down nearly three months later.

 Rau, who has had public spats with Deshmukh in the past, supported Maharashtra governor S.M. Krishnas decision to refer the dance bar draft ordinance back to the government as justifiable. Krishna last week returned the ordinance to the government in view of the forthcoming monsoon session of the legislature beginning on July 11.

 The governor felt the dance bar ordinance did not merit immediate action and asked the government to table it as a bill and allow both Houses of the legislature to discuss and pass it as a legislation.

 The NCP, which had expressed its displeasure at Krishnas action, today said the decision to ban dance bars was taken jointly by the coalition partners and endorsed by the state cabinet unanimously.

 NCP spokesperson Ratnakar Mahajan said though Patil had announced the decision on the floor of the House, the state cabinet, which included representatives of both parties, had endorsed the decision.

 Mahajan said Raus statement will not have any impact on the working relationship of the Congress-NCP coalition.

 The bickering over the bar ordinance is likely to snowball in the next few days as the Democratic Front government attempts to table the ordinance in the monsoon session and tries to get it passed. 

 A section of Congress leaders from Mumbai are opposed to the government decision. They feel the bar girls should be rehabilitated first before the government imposes a ban. It will also be a test for Congress president Sonia Gandhi and NCP chief Sharad Pawar to sort out the issue amicably. The BJP has hinted that it may rally behind Patils decision to ban dance bars. The BJPs electoral partner, the Shiv Sena, has remained vague on the issue.

 A Delhi-based lawyer has already dragged the government to Bombay High Court over the proposed ordinance, claiming that such a move would be a violation of the fundamental right to earn a livelihood. 

 The high court has directed the state advocate-general to file his reply on July 6.

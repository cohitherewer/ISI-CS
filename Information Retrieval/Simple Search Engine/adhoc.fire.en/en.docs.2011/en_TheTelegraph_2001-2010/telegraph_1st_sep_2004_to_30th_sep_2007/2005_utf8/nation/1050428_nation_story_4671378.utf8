 Targeting PM via minister

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, April 27: The National Democratic Alliance has several reasons for picking Laloo Prasad Yadav as its prime target of attack in the second half of the budget session.

 BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: ?We have to persist with the very first issue we raised in the first session of Parliament after the UPA took over. That was the inclusion of tainted ministers in the Manmohan Singh government.? 

 The issue had captured the ?imagination? of opinion-moulders and was one of the reasons why the Rashtriya Janata Dal was voted out of power in Bihar, he claimed.

 It went beyond ?damaging? Laloo Prasad because it called into question the Prime Minister?s ?commitment? to giving a good, clean government, the spokesperson said.

 But sources said there was more to the BJP?s attack on Laloo Prasad. Cracks ?visible? in the Congress-RJD alliance during the Bihar elections had deepened on the ?tainted? ministers? issue, they pointed out.

 The BJP?s reading is that beyond a point, the Congress would find it ?untenable? to defend the railway minister and that if an arrest warrant is issued against him in the fodder scam case, he will go Shibu Soren?s way. Laloo Prasad?s exit, the BJP feels, would ?destabilise? the government and pave the way for a ?third front?.

 ?We have to see what shape this front takes, whether the Congress-Left will support it or whether it will take our (the BJP?s) support from outside,? a source said.

 Given the RJD and the Samajwadi Party?s dependence on Muslim votes, they were likely to prefer that the Congress and not the BJP prop up a ?third front? government. Given the tenuous nature of such experiments in the past, BJP sources felt such a dispensation would not last.

 Another reason for the ?attack-Laloo? campaign is Bihar, which, the BJP feels, is headed towards another election. ?The election can take place at the end of the year if President?s rule is extended by another six months. The issue will be Laloo, he is our enemy number one. Rather than finish the enemy with one fatal blow, it is better to start wounding him gradually from now so that by the time the elections happen, he will find it hard to fight back,? a BJP general secretary said.

 Finally, the framing of charges against Laloo Prasad is helping the BJP turn the attention away from George Fernandes?s alleged involvement in the South African gun deals. 

 If the Congress finds it hard to take up cudgels for the railway minister, BJP sources admitted they were getting tired of fighting Fernandes?s battles. 

 But with even the RSS adopting the former defence minister as its ?mascot?, they have no choice.

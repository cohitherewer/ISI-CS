 Dont trespass, Speaker tells business

 A website of the Indo-US parliamentary forum

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: It was a news report of June 30 announcing the formation of an India-Singapore parliamentary forum that caught Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjees attention. But for the wrong reason.

 The forum was not floated by members of Parliament but Ficci, the industry body. And that was what the Speaker objected to, sources close to him said.

 A quick search by his office revealed that Ficci was using Parliaments official logo on its brochures and websites as though it had secured official approval. The Speaker, the sources said, decided that he should put an end to it.

 Today, he summoned Ficci president Onkar Singh Kanwar and secretary-general Dr Amit Mitra. 

 Kanwar and Mitra were told by Chatterjee that while he appreciated the good work done by their association, this good work will be done in a correct way.

 They were informed that no misuse of Parliament would be brooked because there was a sanctity attached to the logo and the constitution of parliamentary forums. Both were the exclusive preserve of Parliament. 

 Chatterjee made it clear that according to parliamentary rules, only he could constitute forums in consultation with the chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, who is also the Vice-President, and that the word parliamentary could not be co-opted by anyone else.

 Kanwar and Mitra were reportedly told to take necessary correctives immediately by removing the logo from Ficcis websites and literature and dropping the word parliamentary for the forums it had sponsored. 

 Chatterjee, however, sugar-coated the bitter pill he administered by telling the Ficci representatives that if they needed his help on the trade and commerce fronts with friendly countries, it was there.

 While Kanwar and Mitra were not available for their response, industry sources said over the years Ficci has set up six parliamentary forums in conjunction with the US, UK, European Union, Germany, Japan and most recently, Singapore. All of them are not just chaired and co-chaired by members of Parliament but packed with them.

 For instance, the Indo-US one has Murli Deora as its chairman and J.P. Panda as co-chairman; the one with UK has Arun Jaitley and Jyotiraditya Scindia, while Milind Deora is chairman and Manvendra Singh the co-chairman of the forum with Singapore. 

 These forums sponsor delegations of MPs on overseas visits and the favoured destination is the US. Industry sources said last summer, a group ? packed with young MPs like Sachin Pilot, Milind Deora and Singh (all US-educated) ? made a tremendous impact on the political and corporate representatives they met courtesy Ficci.

 So if the MPs had no problem associating themselves with such forums, was it that improper to use the Parliament logo? 

 Sources close to the Speaker dismissed the suggestion, saying it was not the presence of the MPs which was objectionable but Ficcis alleged propensity to use Parliament to market itself.

 The industry sources said Ficci would take corrective steps at the earliest.

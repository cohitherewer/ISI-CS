 Preacher pardons attacker

 BY JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 22: Mata Amritanandamayi today pardoned the man who tried to attack her. However, police booked Pavithran for attempt to murder, ignoring his fathers plea that his son is mentally disturbed.

 Putting the unsavoury episode behind her, the 51-year-old preacher ? popularly known as the hugging saint ? sang bhajans till dawn. She then addressed a news conference at the ashram around 5 am. 

 All those who are born will die one day. I am going ahead keeping this reality in mind. I will carry on. I will continue to give darshan to the devotees coming here to meet me. I dont want my sons (devotees) to create any problem for what had happened yesterday, she said.

 The man had a knife in his hand. But I could not see his face clearly. I told my followers not to send him out lest he should get lynched, added Mata Amritanandamayi, who counts among her disciples several VIPs, including former Kerala chief minister A.K. Antony.

 Her deputy Swami Amrithaswarupananda, however, smelled something fishy. There was more than meets the eye, he said.

 He refused to buy the police version about Pavithrans mental condition. We need to unearth a possible conspiracy and expose the real culprits.

 Pavithrans father Madhavan said his son, who was undergoing psychiatric treatment, has been a devotee of the preacher for the past 15 years. He had been skipping his medicines of late, Madhavan said.

 He threatened to file a case against the ashram inmates for brutally assaulting his son. Pavithran was overpowered when he dashed towards the dais where Mata Amritanandamayi was signing bhajans.

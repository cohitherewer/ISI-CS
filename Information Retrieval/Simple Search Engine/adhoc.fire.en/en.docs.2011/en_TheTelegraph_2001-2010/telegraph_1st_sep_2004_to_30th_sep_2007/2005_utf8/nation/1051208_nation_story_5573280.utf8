 Amitabh fills Natwar void

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: Natwar Singh has gone, so what will the BJP do?

 No sweat really. A long-legged, bearded icon is enough powder for the barrel.

 So as doctors in Mumbai shifted Amitabh Bachchan out of the intensive care unit, the BJP seized on the actors humiliation at the hands of the Centre to launch a belated attack in the capital.

 It accused the Centre of denying Bachchan the honour of inaugurating the International Film Festival of India in Goa last month. The issue was first raised by Amar Singh. But Amitabh Bachchan is an international artiste. His humiliation by the central government is a matter of concern for the country, the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, said.

 Amar Singh had recently said Bachchan was invited to be the chief guest but the Centre squashed the move. But the BJP, at that time, was focusing on the Iraqi oil payoff scam.

 Now that Natwar has resigned, the BJP knows the Volcker issue will not fetch much political dividend. Though party MPs walked out of Parliament today over why Congress chief Sonia Gandhi is not stepping down as chairperson of the National Advisory Council, BJP leaders admit the demand is merely political.

 Sources in Lilavati Hospital, where Bachchan was operated upon for an intestinal ailment, said his condition had shown marked improvement. Bachchan has been shifted from the ICU to the general ward. He can now talk and move normally, Amar Singh told reporters.

 John Abraham

 Model-turned-actor John Abraham was admitted to Lilavati Hospital with fever last night.

 Abraham had been suffering from viral fever for some time, sources told PTI.

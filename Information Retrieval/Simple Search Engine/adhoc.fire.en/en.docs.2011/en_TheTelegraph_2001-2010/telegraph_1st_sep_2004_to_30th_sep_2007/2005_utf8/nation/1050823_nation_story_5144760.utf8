 Worried Pak in Afghan shuffle

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: With less than a week left for Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Afghanistan, Pakistan has decided to change its ambassador in Kabul.

 Tariq Aziz-ud-din-Khan, the chief of protocol in Pakistans foreign office, will replace Akbar Zaib Khan, who had taken charge as ambassador only last month. No reasons were given for replacing Khan, who served as Pakistans deputy high commissioner in Delhi some years ago.

 The sudden change of guard, which has raised questions, has come at a time when Islamabad is getting increasingly worried about Delhis growing influence in Afghanistan.

 It may be that Pakistan wants to put somebody in Afghanistan who would be more effective in countering Indias influence and ensure that Islamabad does not get totally marginalised. Reports from Pakistan suggest that Khan has already returned to Islamabad.

 Singh will be the first Indian Prime Minister in over 45 years to visit Afghanistan on an official visit. He is scheduled to be in Kabul between August 28 and 29.

 Among other things, the Prime Minister, along with his host, President Hamid Karzai, will lay the foundation stone of Afghanistans parliament building, which will be constructed by Indias Central Public Works Department. The complex will have three blocks to house the upper and lower chambers of the parliament and the secretariat.

 Sources said the parliament will depict Gandhara art to reflect the changes since the Taliban regime was ousted and also to make the point that secular ideals are in place, not the ones represented by the student militia that destroyed the centuries-old Bamiyan Buddha.

 Singhs visit will also represent the growing closeness between the two countries since the US-led forces drove out the Taliban and al Qaida members from Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan.

 In this situation, Pakistans role in US efforts to stabilise the Karzai government is crucial. More so as a large number of Taliban and al Qaida members have regrouped and entered Afghanistan from Pakistan.

 Relations between India and Pakistan have also improved considerably in the past two years since they engaged in serious negotiations to push the peace process ahead and resolve their differences through dialogue. As part of this, foreign secretary Shyam Saran will leave for Islamabad next week for talks with his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Mohammed Khan.

 Saran, who will be in Islamabad from August 31 to September 2, will also meet foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri. He could also call on President Pervez Musharraf.

 Indian foreign minister Natwar Singh and his Pakistani counterpart are scheduled to meet in Islamabad on October 4.

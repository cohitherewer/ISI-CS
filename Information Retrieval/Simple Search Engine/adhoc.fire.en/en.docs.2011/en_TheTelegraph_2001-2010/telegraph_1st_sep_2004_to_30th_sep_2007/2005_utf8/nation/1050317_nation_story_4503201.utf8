 Shimla, March 16: The threat did not come true but it has cost Himachal Pradesh dear.

 The ?cost of precautionary measures taken to save human lives and the revenue loss? because of the risk of flooding by an artificial lake on the Pare Chu river has been estimated at over Rs 85.40 crore, revenue minister Sat Mahajan told the Assembly on Tuesday.

 ?While Rs 9 lakh was spent on precautionary measures and (relief) camps, revenue worth Rs 85.40 crore was lost as the state?s main electricity generation units were closed for days together,? he said. About Rs 15,000 more was lost in infrastructure.

 Parts of Himachal near the border with Tibet had braced for disaster last year after a landslide created the artificial lake on the Pare Chu, a tributary of the Sutlej. It was expected to burst its banks and flood villages in the state.

 More than 60,000 residents in the districts of Mandi, Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti, Bilaspur, Kinnaur, Solan and Shimla were under threat. Thousands had been evacuated, affecting apple farming, transport and tourism.

 The lake is frozen these days but the danger is not yet over. It is likely to be renewed in May-June when the snow melts. ?The danger still looms large,? chief minister Virbhadra Singh said.

 ?Hence, the government will not scale down the high alert despite the wide discrepancy in data regarding the size of the lake formed in Tibet as provided by the Chinese authorities and the one made available by the National Remote Sensing Agency, Hyderabad, on the basis of satellite images,? he added.

 The residents of the danger zone, however, had returned home after the fear ebbed around October. 

 ?The fear has cost us dear. Now we will think twice before leaving our house. It is just a hoax and there is no threat to us,? said Ram Singh of Rampur area, 130 km from here.

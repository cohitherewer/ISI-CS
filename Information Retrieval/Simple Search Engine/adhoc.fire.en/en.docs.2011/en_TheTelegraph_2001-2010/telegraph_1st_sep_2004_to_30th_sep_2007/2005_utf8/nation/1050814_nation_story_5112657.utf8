The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Success chant on I-Day

 - Manmohan speech to stress pro-people image

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: If in 2004, while addressing the nation for the first time from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh set out the agenda of the UPA government, this year on August 15, his focus will be on what his government achieved over the last year.

 Sources close to Singh said the achievements would be benchmarked against the promises made in the common minimum programme and would seek to reinforce the pro-people image the government sought to project when it assumed office. 

 The Prime Minister, said sources, would highlight the following policy pronouncements and decisions:

 The Bharat Nirman programme, which was touted as a counter to the NDAs India Shining campaign and envisaged a hold-all package for the creation and development of infrastructure in the villages including rural roads, telecom connectivity, housing (the construction of 60 lakh houses was promised for the poor by 2009), drinking water and electrification

 Rural Health Care Mission, which is funded through a cess on tobacco and related products

 Urban Renewal Mission Backward Regions Grants fund

 Pradhan Mantri Gramin Jal Samvadha Yojana, which is aimed at rural sanitation

 Increased budgetary allocations to the Education for All campaign through a non-lapsable fund and a special allocation of Rs 3,010 crore for the midday meal scheme in government schools

 More money for the Integrated Child Development Scheme

 Sources said the Prime Minister would stress the major social and gender-centered legislations his government proposed to enact in the ongoing Parliament session.

 The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme bill and the amended Hindu Succession Act will be showcased as model laws.

 The state of the economy will also be mentioned but sources emphasised that in keeping with the pro-aam admi (pro-common man) tenor and tone, the message will not dwell so much on the spiralling sensex figures as on how a healthy economy means more percolation of wealth down the social hierarchy.

 Foreign policy will be another component of the Prime Ministers speech. Apart from the reference to the improved relations with the neighbours (read Pakistan), the thrust will be on China and the US and the long road India had traversed in its links with these countries.

 Sources said there will be a mention of Singhs US visit but that it may not specifically focus on the nuclear and defence pacts.

 After the heat raised by the Nanavati Commissions report on the 1984 anti-Sikh violence, the address is likely to reiterate the token commitment to maintaining communal peace and harmony.

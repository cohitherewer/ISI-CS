 Sukhi back, with cry of foul play

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sukhwinder: Lashing out

Chandigarh, June 8: Sukhwinder Kaur, the girl who refused to turn back from her bid to scale Everest, today reached home town Muktsar to a rousing welcome but alleged that she was not given proper equipment for her climb.

 Failing health and her inability to breathe at higher altitudes reportedly compelled Project Himalaya expedition manager Jamie McGuinness to ask Sukhwinder, known affectionately as Sukhi, to return home. 

 But Sukhwinders account differs. Had I been given a proper oxygen cylinder I would have made it to the top, she said over phone.

 Alleging foul play, she said the expedition managers did not treat her well despite charging a huge amount.

 They were given Rs 5 lakh for the expedition. There were times when I had to go without food. Even at the last advance base camp, I was not provided any meals. But I carried on and scaled 8,600 m. Had I been sent two days ago I would not have met with bad weather. I would have scaled the peak. But I was not sent for reasons best known to the expedition managers, she said.

 On the remarks by Australian climber Duncan Chassell that she was the worst climber and was not going home despite bad weather and failing health fearing rejection from her family, Sukhwinder said: Chassell had no business to comment on me. 

 He (Chassell) failed in reaching the height I did. He has called me a housewife. What shall I call him for failing to even beat me?

 The climber said she would go back to scale Everest. No other civilian woman has reached the height I did this time. I will not let the people of Muktsar, who have done so much for me by raising funds for my expedition, down, she added.

 The people of Muktsar have decided to raise funds for Sukhwinder again. 

 This time, Paramjit, who has partnered Sukhwinder on several expeditions, would accompany her.

 I dont know whether to cry or not, Sukhwinder said, touched by the reception she got from her home town. 

 I will put Muktsar on the map of the adventure world. I will scale Everest. The failure this time is not the end of my dreams.

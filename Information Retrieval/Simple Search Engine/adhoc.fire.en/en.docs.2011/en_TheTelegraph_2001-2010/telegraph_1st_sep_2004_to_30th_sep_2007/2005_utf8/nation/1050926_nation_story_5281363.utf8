 Another Jinnah row

 Jinnah: Tug-of-war

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: After Mohammed Ali Jinnahs ghost haunted the Sangh parivar for months, his old home in Mumbai looms over the India-Pakistan dialogue.

 Islamabad seems to have conveyed its concerns to Delhi about the proposed structural changes India allegedly plans to make to Jinnah House before turning it into a Saarc Cultural Centre.

 Agency reports from Islamabad said the Pakistani foreign secretary, Riaz Mohammad Khan, informed the countrys cabinet that he had passed on his governments concerns to India.

 The historical building is likely to come up for discussion when foreign minister Natwar Singh travels to Pakistan next month to take the peace process forward.

 India maintains that Jinnah House has already been declared a heritage building and so nothing can be done to alter its original shape and structure.

 We are only carrying out repairs and will later hand it over to an expert for preservation, a foreign ministry official said in Delhi.

 Singhs itinerary, which takes him to Karachi before Islamabad, makes it more likely that Jinnah House would figure in the talks. 

 In Karachi, the foreign minister might visit the building that housed the Indian consulate-generals office before it was shut down in 1994. In a tit-for-tat move, Delhi closed down the Pakistani consulate in Mumbai. Both sides are now talking about reopening them, and Pakistan wants its consulate at Jinnah House.

 The problem is that while the (former) consulate building in Karachi is Indian property, it isnt clear whether Pakistan owns Jinnah House.

 Delhi has refused Pakistans request and shown it alternative properties in Mumbai ? one of which is being finalised for the consulate.

 The tug-of-war over Jinnah House is, however, decades-old.

 The magnificent building on Mount Pleasant Road, which Jinnah built with care in the 1930s, has been witness to many historic meetings. The Gandhi-Jinnah talks were held there in September 1944; so were the discussions with Subhas Chandra Bose. A year before Independence, Jinnah held a historic meeting with Jawaharlal Nehru in the building.

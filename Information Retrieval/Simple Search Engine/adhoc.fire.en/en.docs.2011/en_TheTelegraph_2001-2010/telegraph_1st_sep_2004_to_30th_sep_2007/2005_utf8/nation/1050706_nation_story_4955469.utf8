 Mataji step inside, theres going to be war here, says quartet

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Ayodhya, July 5: Urmila Pathak spoke to the militants at her doorstep, watched them launch the attack and, from her terrace, saw them die.

 The 57-year-old woman got caught in the whirlpool of events that rocked the pilgrimage town today as she returned from a morning visit to a Shiva temple.

 Almost at the gates of her home, which is just 10 metres from the security fencing around the disputed site, she heard the blast. There was a deafening sound, like the world coming to an end, and people began running helter-skelter, she recalls.

 I was carrying a tray covered with flowers and fruits for my children. The shock of the explosion knocked it off my hands.

 As she stood rooted to the spot, dazed, she saw them.

 There were four of them ? all fair and strongly built ? behind me, she says. They all looked like decent young men. They were, of course, not from this town ? you could see that ? but we are used to seeing outsiders here. After all, this is a pilgrim town.

 They were all carrying black bags, she remembers. I did not know then that they were carrying arms.

 Mataji, one of them told her in a crisp voice, aap kripaya andar jaiye (please go indoors). 

 Whats going on, she asked them. Yahan jung hone wala hai (theres going to be a war here), another told her.

 She withdrew into her house, Sadhana Sadan. Within minutes, she heard assault rifles going off. At once, she was on the roof of her home, hiding behind the branches of a mango tree.

 One of the militants crawled to within yards of the fencing, climbed on the roof of the generator room and jumped in, she says.

 Another clambered up a neem tree to get in. Once inside, they began shooting.

 All we could hear from the distance was the sound of firing. I dont know where they were coming from, Urmila Devi said.

 She heard men screaming as the battle raged on. A man with his hands ripped off kept rolling on the grass till his cries stopped.

 In an hour, at least 100 more securitymen joined the battle, some firing from treetops and roofs of houses. 

 We were asked to vacate the rooftops. We went inside the house, she says.

 A little past 11, we stepped out. There was deathly silence everywhere.

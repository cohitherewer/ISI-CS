 Cautious Arjun open to IIM quota

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: Arjun Singh today said the Centre would consider the recommendation for minority quotas in IITs and IIMs but would not do anything in haste.

 The National Monitoring Committee for Minority Education (NCME), set up by Singhs human resource development ministry, has suggested these quotas in professional institutes, including the Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management and the Indian Institutes of Foreign Trade.

 The NCME has made a suggestion for reservation and it should be considered, the minister said at a news conference after a day-long meeting of the committee in Delhi.

 But he stressed: We cannot take an immediate decision. We will first have to discuss the issue with all the stakeholders ? the institutions and the legal experts.

 Asked whether a minority quota will be in the interest of the public, he replied: Public interest is fairly large. It depends how you perceive it.

 The ministry had earlier sparked a furore by conferring minority status on Aligarh Muslim University, a move the Supreme Court later struck down. Andhra Pradesh High Court recently scrapped as unconstitutional the Y.S.R. Reddy governments order for a minority quota in jobs as well as educational institutions.

 Singh, however, seems willing enough to fight for the latest quota. He cited the directive principles of the Constitution to argue that there was nothing new about the recommendation. Article 46 of the directive principles guarantees the promotion of educational and economic incentives for the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and other weaker sections.

 The ministers response makes it clear that he agrees with the recommendation in principle. But as the issue is sensitive, the government is going to have to tread carefully before acting on it.

 A dialogue with institutions like the IITs and IIMs is likely to run into trouble. The IIMs had a nasty standoff with Singhs predecessor, Murli Manohar Joshi, when he tried to get them to slash their tuition fees by 50 per cent. IIM Ahmedabad took the government to court on the ground that the order infringed on the institutions autonomy.

 A board member at one of the management institutes said he was personally against the decision on the minority quotas. He suggested there should instead be more freeships.

 Kasturi Lal Chopra, former director of IIT Kharagpur, opposed the recommendation outright. He argued that the SC and ST quotas in the IITs have not worked. There is now a 12.5 per cent reservation for SC students and 7.5 per cent for the STs.

 We have relaxed rules for them and have special coaching classes. But this is not helping; they are barely able to clear their examinations, Chopra said. They finish the four-year course in seven to eight years.

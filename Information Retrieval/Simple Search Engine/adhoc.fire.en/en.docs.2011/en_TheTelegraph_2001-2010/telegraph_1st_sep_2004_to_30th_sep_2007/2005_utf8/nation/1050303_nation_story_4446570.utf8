 Nitish recipe foxes rivals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 2: Neither ?DM? nor ?MY? did the trick as much as the Janata Dal (United)?s social combination.

 Contrary to popular belief, the Dal (U) appears to have secured more Muslim votes than the Lok Janshakti Party, which tried to forge a ?DM (Dalit-Muslim)? combination to puncture Laloo Prasad Yadav?s once formidable ?MY (Muslim-Yadav)? blend.

 LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan had given tickets to over a dozen Muslim candidates, but not one was elected. The Dal (U) fielded five Muslims, four of whom were elected despite the party being part of the BJP-led alliance.

 Of the LJP?s 29 newly elected MLAs in Bihar, 16 are from the upper castes (nine Bhumihars and seven Rajputs). Only four from the Scheduled Castes were elected though Paswan is a Dalit leader. The remaining nine are from the backward castes.

 Paswan had run a high-pitched campaign for Muslim votes and even got a few clerics from the community to address election meetings.

 The Dal (U), led by Nitish Kumar, managed a better caste and community combination by winning from a more representative social segment. Apart from its four Muslim MLAs, as many as 10 of its Dalit candidates got elected.

 Ironically, the Dal (U) managed only 14 MLAs from the upper castes (six Rajputs, four Bhumihars, three Brahmins and one Kayasth) compared with the LJP?s 16. The Dal (U)?s 55 MLAs also include 12 Kurmis (Kumar?s fellow caste people), six Kushwahas, 10 Dalits and four from other backward castes. Nine are women.

 The party leadership is elated with its achievement. A senior leader said ?the myth of Laloo Prasad and Paswan has been exploded?.

 The results show that the Dal (U)?s social base is larger than the LJP?s. Paswan?s success lies in his alliance with the Congress that benefited him more than it did the latter. This explains for his upper-caste MLAs.

 The Congress? upper-caste base was transferred to the LJP, which, however, could not transfer its Dalit votes to the partner, resulting in the former?s poor tally of 10 seats.

 Unlike earlier polls, the upper castes this time did not vote for the Dal (U) in the Magadh and Mithilanchal region as they were upset with the BJP?s ?shabby treatment? of former Union minister C.P. Thakur, a Bhumihar.

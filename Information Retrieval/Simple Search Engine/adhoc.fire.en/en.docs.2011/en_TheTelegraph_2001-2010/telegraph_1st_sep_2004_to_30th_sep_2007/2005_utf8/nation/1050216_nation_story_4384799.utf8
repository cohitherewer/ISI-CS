 Calcutta, Feb. 15: Barely able to breathe amid billowing smoke, the young executive clutching a few files close to his heart shouted into his cellphone: ?Sir, thank God, our bank is saved. Yes sir, the bank is safe.? 

 Standing a few feet below, the Brabourne Road branch of ABN AMRO fortuitously escaped the late evening first-floor blaze in PNB House. 

 ?This is a significant branch that controls our operation across the city. Had it been gutted, things would have been very difficult for us. Several employees who had just left the bank returned to help remove important documents. We were apprehensive about the fire reaching our bank,? the executive said. 

 Minutes after the fire started, fire brigade personnel rushed to the spot. 

 ?It was a huge fire when we arrived. The flames were spreading very fast and we were totally at a loss as to where to start. The fact that we had only five fire tenders at our disposal made things worse for us,? said B.M. Sen, director of fire services. 

 ?Since ABN AMRO is a foreign bank, we desperately wanted to save the bank at all costs, since it was a matter of prestige,? he added. 

 Shortly, 50-odd firefighters and several residents plunged into action. ?We went inside the building and found that the fire had engulfed the left side of the first floor (where PNB was located) and was spreading towards the right side. We immediately started concentrating on localising the fire on one side,? Sen said. 

 The firemen found able allies in the canteen boys inside the building who told them about several gas cylinders stored inside a makeshift canteen. ?Please help us in locating the gas cylinders,? shouted a group of five firefighters. They were quickly located and removed. Thereafter, it became easy for the firefighters to localise the fire. 

 ?The fact that ABN AMRO is located in the ground and mezzanine floors made our task of saving it relatively easy,? said a firefighter.

 In their operation to save ABN AMRO bank, the fire officials engaged five water browsers (huge fire fighting engines with automated ladders) which emptied around 14,000 litres of water each. Besides, water from Laldighi was pumped out to refill the fire tenders.

 Shortly after midnight, around 125-odd fire brigade personnel heaved a sigh of relief and declared that the fire was brought under control.

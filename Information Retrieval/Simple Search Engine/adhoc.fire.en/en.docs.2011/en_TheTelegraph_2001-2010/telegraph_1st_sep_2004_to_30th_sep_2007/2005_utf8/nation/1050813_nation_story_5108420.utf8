 ASI plea on Taj 

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Archaeological Survey of India today moved the Supreme Court challenging the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Wakf Board claim that Taj Mahal is a wakf property.

 The ASI contended that the rights over the Taj vested with the Centre and the custodianship has been with it.

 The petition, which is yet to be taken up for hearing, contended that the wakf board had failed to produce the alleged deed or its copy treating the Taj as having been dedicated by emperor Shahjahan to the wakf.

 Shahjahans descendant claimed, according to the counsel for the board, that the emperor had earmarked the monument as a wakf property and ? in a will written in Arabic ? had stated that the income would be used for the poor.

 The petition alleged the boards decision would lead to communal disharmony and law and order problems.

 The board had already filed a caveat ? meaning dont decide without hearing me ? before the Supreme Court pre-empting a petition by the ASI.

 The Taj Conservation Committee, a non-government organisation of Supreme Court advocate Ajay Agarwal had also already filed a petition against the wakf board claim. The committee has sought nullifying of the order passed by the wakf board on the ground that the apex court has been seized of the matter for the last 21 years and no court, board or commission has the jurisdiction to entertain an issue related to the Taj Mahal.

 Sunni Wakf Board chairman Hafiz Usman, who had ordered that the Taj was its property, had also stated in the order that all the connected mosques and tombs, which were surrounded by a wall, were wakf property and it was essential to register them as such in accordance with the Waqf Act 1995.

 He had directed the chief executive officer of the board to convene a meeting of the ministries concerned of the Union and state governments and the Sunni central wakf board officials to decide the scheme of management of this the Taj. 

 No date has been fixed for the ASI petition in the Supreme Court and the matter could be mentioned next week for an early hearing.

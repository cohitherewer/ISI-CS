The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Troops on Congo mission

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 3: A brigade-sized force of the Indian Army is being deployed in Congo, the troubled African nation where internecine conflict has warranted that UN ?peacekeepers? turn into ?peace enforcers?.

 India will contribute a total of 2,850 troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A battalion-sized force of 850 troops was moved to the country last month.

 In September 2004, a special support services contingent of the Indian Air Force was flown to the African nation, the size of western Europe. That was in two contingents of 243 air warriors from the Indian Air Force and about a 100-strong team from 9 Para, an army special forces unit.

 In August, the UN extended the mandate for MONUC, the UN mission in Congo, and secretary-general Kofi Annan urged for greater contributions in cash and kind.

 Indian troops and other troops in the UN blue-helmeted force in the Democratic Republic of Congo are at risk from warring Hema and Lendu tribal militia and rebel troops from President Kabila?s army.

 Deputy chief of army staff Lieutenant General J.B.S. Yadava said today the entire Indian contingent will be deployed in Congo by next month. Flagging off the troops, Lt Gen. Yadava said it was important for them to perform in an exemplary fashion for the UN.

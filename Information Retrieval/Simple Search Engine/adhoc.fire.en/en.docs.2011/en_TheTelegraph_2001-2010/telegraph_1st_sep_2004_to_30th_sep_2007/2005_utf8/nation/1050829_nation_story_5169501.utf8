 Fuel-thirsty India in pipeline balancing act

Boom, boom amp; butterflies

 Shortly before the Prime Ministers black stretch limousine entered the grounds of Palace No. 2 in the Argh (the royal complex) that is the official residence of President Hamid Karzai, guns boomed. The assembled media and security officials already inside the campus froze.

 What! Theyre here too.

 Then the guns boomed and boomed again and again. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was being given a rare 21-gun salute.

 Huh, the hug

 President Karzai stood on the 

 driveway, his beautiful cape subtly embroidered in a light 

 shade of blue and gold on a black background billowing in 

 the light breeze as the limousine drew up.

 He put his Karakul fez on his head as the limousine stopped and the Prime Minister alighted. Karzai shook his hands and then embraced him.

 Manmohan Singh, self-effacing 

 as usual, was a trifle embarrassed but reciprocated the 

 gesture.

 Rahuls role

 No one knows Rahul Gandhis programme in detail. At the press conference, Rahul made his first appearance in his diplomatic avatar ? fawn suit, rimless glasses of the latest understated fashion. The press conference was held in the gardens of Palace No. 2.

 As Manmohan Singh and Karzai took questions, Natwar Singh, rose on his breast pocket and cap on head, pointed out the shady trees to Rahul.

 According to the official programme, Rahul is to accompany the Prime Minister on every engagement. The official engagements for today end by 7 in the evening. Where does he go after that?

 SPG disarmed

 In the lead-up to the Prime Ministers 

 visit, the Indian security contingent has had to contend 

 with several rings of guards. 

 There were the footsoldiers of the US, the troops of the Afghan National Army, then there were the private security guards of mostly prematurely-retired US special forces soldiers hired by security companies such as Dynacorps, then the ISAF and the US army.

 Indias Special Protection 

 Group (SPG), the elite protection squad for Indias 

 VIPs, had to negotiate their way through for access. They 

 were told they will have the access but they can carry no 

 weapon. The SPG was disarmed.

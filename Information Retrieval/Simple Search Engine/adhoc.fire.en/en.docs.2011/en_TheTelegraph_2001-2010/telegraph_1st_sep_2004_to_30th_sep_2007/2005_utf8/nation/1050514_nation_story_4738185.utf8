 Rs 10000 fine for Sindh petition 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 13: Observing that the national anthem is an immortal classic not subject to change, the Supreme Court today dismissed a petition that sought to replace the word Sindh with Kashmir as that province is no longer with India.

 The court also imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 on petitioner Sanjeev Bhatnagar for wasting the valuable time of the court and termed his public interest litigation a publicity interest litigation.

 National anthem is the representative of the ethos of the country. Any classic, once created, becomes immortal and inalienable; even its creator may not like making changes into it.

 Any tampering with the script of the poem would be showing disrespect to the great poet Rabindranath Tagore, Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti said in a unanimous verdict of a three-judge bench.

 The court said a national anthem was a hymn or a song expressing patriotic sentiments or feelings and not a chronicle which defines the territory of the nation which has adopted the anthem.

 Agreeing with the contention of the Centre and the Sindhi Council of India, the Supreme Court said any tampering with the anthems original script would distort it and spark discontent among the large number of Sindhis living in India and abroad.

 Coming down hard on the petitioner, the judges said the PIL was completely devoid of merit and should never have been filed in the guise of public interest.

 It is more of a publicity interest litigation wherein the petitioner seems to have achieved his purpose, they added.

 The cost of Rs 10,000 was being imposed on the petitioner to discourage the filing of such petitions which result in wasting of valuable time of the court.

 The judges reiterated that the anthem did not list the states or regions that were part of India when it was composed.

 It is not necessary that the structure of the national anthem should go on changing as and when the territories or geographical regions or provinces undergo changes.

 In that case, what would happen with newly-created states like Uttaranchal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh? By the same logic the national anthem would have to be modified to accommodate the names of these states, the court said.

 Earlier, the Centre had said the Constituent Assembly in 1950 adopted the national anthem when Sindh was already a part of Pakistan. 

 Any tampering with the poetic language or the text would stir a hornets nest encouraging demands for inclusion or deletion of words in the national anthem, it had said.

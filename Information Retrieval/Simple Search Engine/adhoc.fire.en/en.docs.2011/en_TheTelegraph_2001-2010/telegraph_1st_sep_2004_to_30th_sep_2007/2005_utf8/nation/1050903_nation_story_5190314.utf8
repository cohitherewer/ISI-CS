 Jaya raises canal cry

 Chennai, Sept. 2: Two months after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh launched the Sethusamudram ship canal project, Jayalalithaa is crying foul.

 The Tamil Nadu chief minister today urged the Centre to immediately stop dredging operations to deepen stretches of Palk Strait off the Tamil Nadu coast. 

 The initial exercise, taken up by the Dredging Corporation of India in the sea off Port Calimere near Nagapattinam, has confirmed our worst fears that the livelihood of fishermen was being destroyed, she said on the eve of the Prime Ministers visit to Chennai.

 Jayalithaa pointed out how the project is a threat to coastal fisheries and the under-sea eco-system.

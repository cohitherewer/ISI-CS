 Sound and fury over breakfast

 New Delhi, Feb. 23: Left leaders will express their ?anguish and humiliation? over the government?s economic reforms when they meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his 7 Race Course Road residence tomorrow.

 The leaders of Left parties who have been invited by Singh to a pre-budget breakfast meeting have spent the last fortnight launching missiles at the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government for its refusal to heed their suggestions. 

 Tomorrow, they will again get the opportunity to urge the government to stick to the common minimum programme.

 But sources said the Left seems to have realised that the UPA regime will not jettison its economic agenda because of their pressure. The government, on its part, is confident that the Left will not destabilise it, at least for the time being.

 A Left leader also said so. ?We are not considering a third front at the moment.?

 The Left?s ?anguish? comes in the wake of a series of hard decisions on reforms despite its objections. The government has raised the cap on foreign direct investment to 79 per cent in telecom and taken the first steps to free public sector banks from government control. It is talking about bringing FDI in retail, real estate and the print media, unbundling the power sector and divesting shares of well-heeled public sector undertakings. 

 ?We will create noise in Parliament over these policies and will carry on struggles and movements outside,? said a Left leader.

 The budget, to be presented by finance minister P. Chidambaram on Monday, will be a test of the extent of the government?s willingness to accommodate the Left?s suggestions. Leaders say the budget could either ?improve? or ?worsen? UPA-Left relations.

 The Left has told Chidambaram it wants among other things an increase in corporate tax, end to all exemptions corporate groups enjoy at present and a Rs 50,000-crore allocation for the social sector.

 As for the government, it can assuage the Left?s feelings to a considerable extent by incorporating its suggestions in the employment guarantee bill draft. The Left has criticised the law ministry?s draft as inadequate.

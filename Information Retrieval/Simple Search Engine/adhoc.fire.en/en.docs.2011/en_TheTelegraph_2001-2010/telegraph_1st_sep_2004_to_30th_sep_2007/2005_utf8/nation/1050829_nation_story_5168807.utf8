 Rural job scheme

 New Delhi, Aug. 28 (PTI): The scheme guaranteeing at least 100 days employment to each rural household annually is likely to be launched either on Gandhi Jayanti or Childrens Day.

 Since the National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill was passed last week, the rural development ministry has been framing rules and guidelines before launching the scheme, official sources said.

 The scheme will be launched in 200 districts this year for which Rs 4,000 crore will be needed between December 2005 and March 2006. However, within the next four years, all the 600 rural districts will be covered at an annual outlay of Rs 50,000 crore.

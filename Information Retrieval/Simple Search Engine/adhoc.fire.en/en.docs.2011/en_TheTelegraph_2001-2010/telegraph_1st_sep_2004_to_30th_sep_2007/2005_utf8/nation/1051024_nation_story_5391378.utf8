The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 LoC relief link useless, says Malik

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, Oct. 23: Most of the earthquake-affected in Muzaffarabad are so badly wounded that they would not be able to come to any of the proposed relief centres that India has offered to open adjacent to the Line of Control, Yasin Malik, the chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, has said.

 In a telephone call to The Telegraph from Rawalpindi, Malik appealed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to modify his governments decision and allow the delivery of relief directly to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 I appeal to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to consider modifying his decision on humanitarian grounds and allow relief delivery directly to Muzaffarabad. I have just returned from Muzaffarabad and I know that it is impossible for these people to even reach the LoC. They are all wounded and are in no position to do so, the JKLF chairman said.

 Describing the grim situation in Muzaffarabad, he said: It is qayamat (doomsday). The entire town smells of death. The stench of bodies rotting under the rubble is all-permeating. There is complete devastation. Not one house stands intact. The dead whose bodies have been pulled out from the rubble are being buried in mass graves, with 30- 40 people in one grave.

 Malik said he had toured all of Muzaffarabad on foot and visited each locality. It is a ghost town now. One entire generation of Kashmiris has been wiped out. Unfortunately, it was the young. Mostly they were students. It is a very sad situation, he said.

 There was no open space left in Muzaffarabad town even for pitching tents, the JKLF chairman claimed. The town in any case had only two or three open grounds.

 I myself stayed in a tent with the people for three days but had to come down to Rawalpindi after developing high fever, Malik said. He is being treated for 102 degrees Fahrenheit temperature, probably due to exposure.

 He said about 40,000 quake-affected people from Muzaffarabad had moved to Rawalpindi and the hospitals there were overflowing with the wounded.

 Malik distributed a truckload of blankets and tents in Muzaffarabad and gave Rs 10 lakh towards emergency relief to Sardar Anwar Khan, the president of PoK.

 In Rawalpindi, Malik also donated Rs 50,000 each to the six hospitals treating the quake victims. 

 The JKLF chairman, who claims to have collected Rs 1 crore from Kashmiris in India and abroad for relief, now plans to visit the other affected areas of Bagh, Rawalakot, Mansera and Balakot.

 What people require here are tents and blankets. I appeal to my Indian friends to open their hearts and send relief to the Kashmiris in Pakistan, Malik said.

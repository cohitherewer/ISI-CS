 Court calls for action on squatters 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, May 2: Patna High Court today came down heavily on the Bihar administration and police, hours before Narayan Mishra was replaced by Ashish Ranjan Sinha as the director-general of police.

 The court reprimanded the administration for its failure to end unauthorised occupation of government quarters by public servants posted outside Patna and the question of providing security guards. 

 The division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S.N. Hussain expressed its dissatisfaction over the report on the double issues filed by Mishra in the court today. 

 ?The reckless appointment of bodyguards and house guards for VIPs without consulting the district-level security committee is a violation of the Bihar Police Manual Section 999,? advocate M.P. Gupta said, while arguing for the Indian Medical Association petition on law and order in the state. 

 The court directed the police administration to remove all illegal occupants from government quarters and file an affidavit on May 16 with a detailed report.

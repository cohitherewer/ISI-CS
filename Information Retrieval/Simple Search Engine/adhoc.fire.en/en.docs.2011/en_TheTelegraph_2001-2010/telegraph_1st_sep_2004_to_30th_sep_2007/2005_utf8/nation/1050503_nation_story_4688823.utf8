 Junket jolt to George from govt

 Fernandes: New worries

New Delhi, May 2: Former defence minister and NDA convener George Fernandes faces another round of charges of corruption this week, with the CPM and the Congress questioning his decision to give the hospitality of the armed forces to Justice S.N. Phukan who is heading the commission that is probing suspicious defence deals.

 Fernandes, who was boycotted by the Opposition in Parliament during his tenure as defence minister, is already embattled after a South African investigative agency began probing a supply of anti-materiel rifles to the Indian Army by armaments manufacturer Denel. 

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee last month referred the Denel deal and 37 other transactions during Fernandes? tenure to the CBI.

 Phukan, his wife and lawyers of the panel were given a junket on Indian Air Force communication and VIP squadron and hosted by the army and the navy six weeks before his first report in February last year. The judge and his wife were flown to Pune, Ahmednagar, Mumbai and Shirdi in the last week of December 2003. 

 Permission for civilians to travel on IAF aircraft has to be granted by the defence ministry and Phukan?s junket was okayed by Fernandes.

 The junket in itself was not expensive but it raises questions of propriety and, importantly, if the defence ministry under Fernandes has influenced its findings to exonerate itself of charges of corruption. The Phukan Commission report is likely to be tabled in Parliament before the end of the current session.

 ?There is a conflict of interest here,? the CPM?s Nilotpal Basu said here today, and wondered how a judge investigating the defence ministry could be given favours by the agency it is scanning. Congress spokesman Anand Sharma, too, said his party was demanding a discussion in Parliament.

 The CPM wants the United Progressive Alliance government to report if there has been any violation of guidelines in the use of IAF aircraft by the chairman probing the Tehelka ?sting operation? to expose corruption in defence transactions. 

 The judge?s plea for taking the hospitality of the defence ministry, as reported in a newsmagazine, is that he was familiarising himself with the weapon systems that were being studied by the commission.

 ?I do not know what kind of weapon systems familiarisation they were carrying out in Shirdi. I want to know if there was any violation of the guidelines of the IAF whose aircraft are generally used by the President and the Prime Minister,? the CPM?s Basudeb Acharya said in the House. Shirdi is frequented by pilgrims to the ashram of a godman.

 Justice Phukan and his wife were hosted at the IAF station in Pune, the Armoured Corps? Centre and School in Ahmednagar and a naval officers? mess in Mumbai.

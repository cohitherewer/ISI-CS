 In a crunch, vote Laloo

 Masaurhi (Patna), Feb. 17: Even a blunt sickle draws the crop towards you.

 The enigmatic proverb from the policeman ? deployed to guard, of all people, a teacher ? came after an animated discussion on the prospects of Laloo Prasad Yadav in the Assembly election. 

 People are critical, even abusive, of Laloo Prasad?s rule, he clarified, but when it comes to the crunch, backward classes will vote for him.

 Shyam Bihari Prasad Yadav, head of the Masallahpur Bazaar Samiti, is even more forthright. ?You don?t disown a maimed son, do you??

 He has a litany of charges against Laloo Prasad but has no doubt for which party he will cast his vote. Shyam Bihari had applied for a revolver licence in 2001. He is still to get one, despite a ruling party MP?s recommendation.

 ?If you look at the list of people given arms licences during Laloo?s regime, you will find a majority of them belong to upper castes,? he adds, lamenting that bureaucrats and police officers do not follow even Laloo Prasad?s orders.

 Why would he still vote for Laloo Prasad? Because the upper castes are not merely targeting an individual, he says, but an entire community. Every time an election approaches, the upper castes become aggressive, vowing to put an end to the raj of gwars (rule by Gwalas or Yadavs). 

 ?This is not acceptable to us and take it from me, Lalooji and his lalten (his party symbol) will have no difficulty forming the government.? 

 That could well be an exaggeration because there are indications of simmering resentment. Raju Dusadh is outspoken in condemning Laloo Prasad. 

 He remembers shouting slogans when the price of mustard oil had reached Rs 16. ?Dekho bhai India ka khel/ solah rupaiye sarson ka tel.? 

 Mustard oil now sells for Rs 60 and yet there is no protest to be heard, he says.

 In Masaurhi itself, there seems to be a consensus that Laloo Prasad?s nominee, sitting MLA Dharmendra Yadav, would lose because he is uniformly unpopular. But with Dalit votes seemingly splitting three ways, among Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the CPI (ML), it remains to be seen who benefits from the division.

 The teacher referred to at the beginning is a rare backward caste member who has two police bodyguards. Extremely popular, he is reputed to earn lakhs and has received several extortion demands.

 ?But none of these demands ever comes from a Yadav or any other backward community; why do they come only from upper castes?? he asks. The caste divide appears to be as sharp as in 1990 when Laloo Prasad became chief minister for the first time. Ironically, and contrary to popular belief, the backward castes do not seem to have been empowered by ?Laloo raj?. 

 ?Laloo has given us voice and standing but upper caste men, police and the courts continue to oppress us,? say Shyam Bihari and Dusadh.

 Late last year, a backward caste rickshaw-puller in Patna was forced to drink urine when he asked for water after being brutally thrashed at an upper caste minister?s residence. His crime: he had gatecrashed into a wedding reception and had eaten before he was identified. 

 Such examples are dime a dozen. Still, Anirudhdh Thakur, who works in a barber?s shop near the old secretariat, took three days off to go to his village in Jehanabad and vote for Laloo Prasad.

 ?He has done very little for us; had he worked, he would have become like Gandhi and we would have worshipped him. But what he has done is enough for us,? adds Thakur.

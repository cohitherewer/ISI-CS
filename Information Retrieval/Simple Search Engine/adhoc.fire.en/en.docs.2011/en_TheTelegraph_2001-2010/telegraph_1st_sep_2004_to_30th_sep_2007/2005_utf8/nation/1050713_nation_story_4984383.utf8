 Abattoir fine on pollution board

New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has fined the Central 

Pollution Control Board Rs 25,000 for its failure to regulate the hundreds of 

illegal slaughterhouses in the country.

 The board, which had so far received only accolades from the apex court in various matters, was not doing its duty, the court said. 

 It directed the board chairman to file an affidavit within two weeks detailing the action taken on slaughterhouses that lack solid waste disposal facility.

 It is a total dereliction of duty on the part of the CPCB. This is not the way a central body mandated to check pollution functions, the court said.

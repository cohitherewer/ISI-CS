 Dalit divisions surface

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Chandigarh, Sept. 1: The arson in Haryana has brought to the fore sharp differences among Dalit leaders.

 A section of Dalit leaders today accused BSP chief Mayavati of remaining silent on yesterdays torching of 54 houses in the state by a Jat mob.

 She would be happy if such incidents keep happening, said Justice Party president Udit Raj. She imagines anti-Dalit violence only consolidates her position among them. It is deplorable.

 A spokesperson for the BSP leader said Mayavati is expected to visit the Haryana town tomorrow. She has met people from Haryana and is trying to find out what really happened. We have to know what happened before we react, the spokesperson said.

 The attack on Balmiki Basti in Gohana, a town in Sonepat district near Delhi, followed the lynching of a young Jat on August 27 over a minor disagreement.

 Police have booked 23 people for the violence. Among them are the son and brother of BJP national vice-president and Sonepat MP Kishan Singh Sangwan. The party has decided to send a five-member team to Gohana.

 LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan, too, has decided to send a fact-finding team but his ally, the Congress, which rules Haryana, remained unfazed. The chief minister will handle the situation in the best and the most effective way possible, said a senior AICC leader.

 In Haryana, Dalits hit the streets in protest and demanded chief minister B.S. Hoodas resignation.

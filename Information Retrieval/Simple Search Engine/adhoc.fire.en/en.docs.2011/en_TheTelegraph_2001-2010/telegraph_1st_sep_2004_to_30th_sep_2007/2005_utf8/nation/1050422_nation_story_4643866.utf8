The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mayor stands still at marathon 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, April 21: A marathon six-hour meeting between Mamata Banerjee and Subrata Mukherjee last night yielded no solution on whether the Trinamul Congress should ally with the Congress to counter the CPM in the civic elections. 

 Trinamul chief Mamata remained adamant on having nothing to do with the Congress while the mayor stuck to his stand of an alliance. 

 The meeting, which began around 8 pm and lasted till 2 am, was attended by legislators Sougata Roy and Sadhan Pande, besides general secretary Mukul Roy and Sovan Chatterjee, the member, mayor-in-council, water supply, Trinamul officials said. 

 The meeting was held at Mamata?s Harish Chatterjee Street home in south Calcutta. Mukherjee stuck to his line, saying it would be impossible to defeat the Left parties in the civic polls without allying with the Congress. 

 That Mukherjee favours a return to the Congress is well-known. ?He (Subrata) thinks an alliance with the Congress before the 2006 Assembly elections is imperative, so why not go for the alliance now?? asked a Mukherjee aide.

 Mamata, however, said there was no question of an understanding with the Congress as it was still dependent on the CPM?s support for running the United Progressive Alliance government in Delhi.

 Party sources said Mamata urged Mukherjee to stick to the party line and clear the confusion by issuing a statement before the press today. 

 Mukherjee, though, did no such thing. When contacted over telephone, the mayor said: ?I have told Mamata that we can face the CPM?s challenge in Bengal only by allying with the Congress and other anti-Left forces.? Thereafter, the mayor became incommunicado.

 The meeting began with Mukul Roy accusing Mukherjee of discussing poll alliances with Congress leaders Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi without the party?s sanction. Mukherjee defended his role, saying there was nothing wrong in holding discussions with the Congress leaders as his sole purpose was to ensure the CPM?s defeat.

 Mamata reminded Mukherjee of the party?s recent meet in Contai, where the Trinamul decided not to have any truck with the Congress as long as it leans on the Left Front to stay in power at the Centre. 

 But Mukherjee felt that the Congress?s political compulsion at the Centre has nothing to do with state politics. He pointed out that the two parties had earlier entered into unofficial seat adjustments in panchayat and municipal polls.

 Mamata made it clear she was not against the formation of a broad-based anti-CPM front in Bengal, but for that ?let the Congress leaders here snap all kind of ties with the CPM first?. ?We will then welcome them in a mahajot.? 

 She added: ?When we formed an alliance with the Congress during the last Assembly polls, we quit the NDA. Is the Congress ready to disassociate itself from the CPM for an alliance with us before the municipal polls??

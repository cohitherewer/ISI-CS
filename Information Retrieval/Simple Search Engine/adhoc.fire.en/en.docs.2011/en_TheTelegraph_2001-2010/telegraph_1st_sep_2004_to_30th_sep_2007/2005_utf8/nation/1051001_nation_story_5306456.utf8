 Border fence hits stalemate

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: The annual round of talks between the BSF and Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) today ended without agreement on any major issue, including that of border fencing.

 The stalemate resulted from a mismatch of views over how far the fence should be from the zero line ? the precise position of the border.

 Our contention is, India can go ahead fencing up to zero line because of topographical reasons. However, Bangladesh considers fencing at the border a defensive structure and hence there could be no fencing, BSF chief R.S. Mooshahary explained.

 Both countries had agreed that the fence should be 150 metres from the zero line on either side, but Delhi wants an exception made at places where Indian settlements stretch almost up to the line. Keeping to the 150-metre stipulation would mean fencing off many of these Indians.

 Mooshahary said the BSF would submit to Dhaka a list of areas where it feels zero-line fencing is required.

 Apart from this, he said, the two sides had agreed on several confidence-building measures, such as co-ordinated and simultaneous patrolling along the border, exchange of training facilities and exchanges in the fields of sports and culture.

 As the BDR chief, Major General Jehangir Alam Choudhury, faced the media after the meeting, he came under some aggressive questioning. For instance, a reporter asked: Why is Bangladesh stabbing us in the back after we helped it become independent in 1971?

 The general gave back as good as he got, mixing angry replies with questions of his own before walking away in a huff, saying: I do not want to answer a hostile media who are not interested in knowing what constructive things took place during the talks.

 As the reporters bombarded him with questions about the alleged murder of BSF commandant Jeevan Kumar by the BDR, Choudhury hit back by saying 32 Bangladeshis had been killed by the Indians between April and August. It led to a volley of allegations and counter-allegations.

 Many among the journalists could not stomach Choudhurys accusation that criminals from India had joined Bangladeshi gangs to carry out the August 17 serial blasts, or his claim that no Indian terrorist organisation was based in his country.

 Mooshahary, who had been trying to calm tempers, protested strongly, saying India has proof that terrorist leaders like Paresh Barua, Ranjan Daimari, Jeevan Singha, Anup Chetia and Ranjit Debbarma are operating from Bangladesh. He also said that among the 500-odd people arrested in Bangladesh after the blasts, only one was an Indian.

 Later, the Indian foreign ministry expressed deep shock at the accusation of an Indian hand in the bombings, calling it a baseless and scurrilous allegation.

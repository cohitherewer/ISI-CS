 HC takes up hospital cause 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 7: Patna High Court today directed the Bihar administration to improve the functioning of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and make it ?poor-friendly?.

 Chief secretary and acting adviser to the governor, K.A.H. Subramanyam, visited the hospital to review its status and said he would make necessary changes to improve the condition of PMCH within a fixed period. 

 Subramanyam will also review the other medical colleges in the state in a bid to streamline the healthcare system.

 Taking up a PIL, the division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S.N. Hussain told the administration to ensure ?qualitative improvement? of the hospital.

 The court expressed concern over reports of alleged irregularities in the emergency ward, where doctors are said to be ?missing? during duty hours. It also asked the administration to make special arrangements for patients coming from far-off places of the state. 

 Two of the biggest problems of the hospital at present are the dearth of doctors and absence of state-of-the-art facilities . 

 These apart, frequent strikes by staff members and students have left Bihar?s premier hospital and medical college in a sad state.

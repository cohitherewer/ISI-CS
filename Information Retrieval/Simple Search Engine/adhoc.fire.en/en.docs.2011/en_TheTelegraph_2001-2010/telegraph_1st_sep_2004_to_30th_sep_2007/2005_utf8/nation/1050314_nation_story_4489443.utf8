The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Boundary focus in Wen visit 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 13: Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is coming to India on a four-day official visit beginning April 9, in what is being seen as a move to build a strong strategic partnership between the nations.

 The visit comes in the backdrop of a recent report by the US government projecting the two nations as emerging world powers by the next decade. However, while Washington perceives Beijing as a potential threat to its influence, it does not see such a problem with Delhi.

 Wen will first visit Bangalore and then come to Delhi on the evening of April 10. Over the next two days, he will discuss with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other senior leaders the conversion of bilateral ties into a strategic partnership.

 A Delhi declaration of sorts ? to be signed jointly by the two Prime Ministers ? will lay stress on India and China working as partners to deepen bilateral ties. The focus during the visit will be on economic cooperation and the boundary controversy.

 The Chinese Prime Minister will also hold a series of talks with leading entrepreneurs and industrialists in Bangalore and Delhi. The trade volume between the two nations has already crossed $13 billion this year. They are likely to set fresh targets to significantly increase the volume of bilateral trade.

 The two special representatives on the boundary row ? M.K. Narayanan and his Chinese counterpart Dai Bin Guo ? are likely to meet in Delhi this month. The meeting is being seen as important as the ?guiding principles? under which the neighbours are likely to resolve the decade-old boundary dispute may be agreed upon after these discussions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Calm before the storm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, May 8: The Election Commissions special observer, L.V. Saptharishi, had looked unperturbed when asked by journalists about large-scale rigging at Chhapra at the Saran district magistrates office on April 26 last year.

 ?The district magistrate and the police superintendent will submit a report by evening,? he had said.

 Reminded about complaints against the district magistrate and the superintendent of police, he had said: ?Even those will be looked into provided we get specific complaints.?

 The observer had sent a report saying the Chhapra polls need not be countermanded.

 However, by evening, channels were telecasting news of rigging in an election in which one person died and many were injured. 

 The police firing at Nawadih, the bomb blast at Chirand and the movement of RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadavs brother-in-law, Subhash Yadav, in a blue numberless Scorpio were reported.

 The poll panel had asked Subhash Yadav to leave the sensitive constituency.

 Laloo Prasad said in the evening that the polling had been free and fair while the BJPs Rajiv Pratap Rudy alleged that it had been turned to a farce by the RJD chiefs supporters and a pliant administration.

 The next day, the BJP formally submitted a memorandum demanding the poll be countermanded.

 On May 10, the Election Commission ordered a total repoll on May 31.

 The countermanding was ordered on a report by poll panel rapporteur K.J. Rao. The repoll was held amid unprecedented security.

 When the results came out on June 2, Laloo Prasad had trounced Rudy by around 70,000 votes. 

 The RJD chief later vacated Madhepura and retained the Chhapra seat.

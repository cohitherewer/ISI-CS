 PoK high, Pak cautious

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Islamabad, April 6: The militant strike in Srinagar caused ripples in Pakistan today but the establishment as well as prospective passengers said they would not be cowed down by such ?dastardly acts?.

 ?The attack on innocent Kashmiris is, in fact, a heinous assault on humanity,? foreign ministry spokesperson Jalil Abbas Jilani told reporters in Islamabad in a quick reaction condemning the attack.

 Jilani was initially reluctant to confirm whether the bus service would take off from Muzaffarabad as scheduled. ?Pakistani and Indian officials are in touch with each other, reviewing the latest situation and the security arrangements for the service,? he said.

 Jilani later said the bus service would go ahead as scheduled.

 However, even before the formal announcement was made in Islamabad, the Prime Minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (referred to as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in India), Sardar Sikandar Hayat, said he would see off passengers at the inaugural tomorrow.

 ?I am fully sure that the bus will run from our side,? he told a private television channel. ?Let?s see what is acceptable to Allah.?

 ?We express grave sorrow at this very unfortunate incident,? foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri told reporters. ?We condemn this incident.?

 He added: ?No religion allows violence. This particular thing is really unbelievable because they (the passengers) have committed no crime. All they wanted to do is to meet their loved ones from whom they have been separated.?

 Farooq Haider, a senior official in PoK, also said the bus will run according to schedule. ?Violence will not delay the bus service.?

 Passengers who were to take the service from Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK, said they were determined to make the journey to Srinagar.

 ?I am not scared. I will definitely go if the bus goes,? said Nisar Ahmed Zakir. ?In war-like situations, such incidents happen. But I will go.?

 Officials said tickets for 27 of the 30 seats on the bus from Muzaffarabad had been collected and the three remaining passengers were expected to pick up theirs when they arrived from outlying areas.

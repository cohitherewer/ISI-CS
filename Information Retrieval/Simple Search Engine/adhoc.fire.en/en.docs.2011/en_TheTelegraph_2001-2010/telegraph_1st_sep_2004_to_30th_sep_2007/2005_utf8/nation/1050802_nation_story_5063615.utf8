 Glare to stay on Laloo case

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: The Supreme Court today ensured that the disproportionate assets case against Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi is neither concluded nor closed without its permission.

 It allowed the prosecution to submit its evidence and conclude its arguments before the CBI special court at Patna; but the defence arguments, it directed, would begin only with the permission of the apex court.

 What it means is that no verdict in the disproportionate assets case can be given unless the apex court completes hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) accusing Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi of misusing their position in the UPA government to interfere and influence the trial.

 Since both Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi are out on bail, the petitioners had prayed for cancellation of their bail and complained that otherwise they would misuse their position to influence the trial.

 The PIL, filed in November last year, had accused the Union railway minister and his wife of engineering a favourable order from an income-tax tribunal; it had also expressed apprehension that a similar attempt could be made to influence the trial of the disproportionate assets case.

 In April this year, the Supreme Court judge, S.N. Variava, caused a sensation by claiming in court that someone from Patna High Court had called him to enquire if the CBI special judge hearing the case could be transferred on promotion.

 Two days later, however, he retracted and declared that it was merely an academic question and he was convinced that it was an innocent question by a social acquaintance.

 Within two months, however, the CBI special judge Yogendra Prasad was transferred on promotion and the post left vacant for the next few weeks, at the end of which Munni Lal Paswan was posted by Patna High Court as the CBI special judge and directed to conclude the trial.

 The petitioners of the PIL, Sushil Kumar Modi of the BJP and Rajiv Prasad Lallan of the JD(U), thereafter drew the attention of the Supreme Court to the curious developments. There was no justification, they argued, to transfer the judge at the fag end of the trial.

 A three-judge bench of Justices Variava, A.R. Lakshmanan and S.H. Kapadia today called for the submission of all details on the circumstances of the transfer and promotion of Yogendra Prasad.

 The bench also called for details of Yogendra Prasads successor Munni Lal Paswan and observed, the court must not be presented with a fait accompli.

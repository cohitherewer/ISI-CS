 A town for Jallianwala martyr

 - salute to freedom fighter, slap to guerrillas

 Chandigarh, July 31: The Centre has agreed to rename Sunam in Sangrur as Shaheed Udham Singhwala 65 years after the freedom fighter sacrificed his life to avenge the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, reports our correspondent.

 Announcing this at a rally in the district town today, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said the martyrs ancestral home, a one-room tenement, will be converted into a museum. 

 Every year on July 31 ? the day Udham Singh was hanged in 1940 ? politicians descend on Sunam in hordes to make promises that are never kept. Amarinders announcement today, too, is being viewed with scepticism.

 This is nothing new for us. We have lost faith in politicians. They come every year and make promises, a Sunam resident said.

 Today should have been a solemn occasion, but it was turned into an election rally by the chief minister who was more interested in lashing out at the Opposition than in paying his respects to a great freedom fighter. They (politicians) will resurface again next year with the same promises.

 The house where the martyr was born on December 26, 1899, is in Mohalla Peelbad in the centre of the town. The area teems with encroachers while the administration turns a deaf ear to complaints by Udham Singhs descendants, who continue to live in poverty.

 The governments indifference towards the martyr can be gauged from the way it delayed handing over the house to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). This was done only four years ago.

 Although the ASI has put up a signboard prohibiting any changes being made to the tenement, a modern toilet has been allowed to be built in its backyard.

 Udham Singh had avenged the Jallianwala Bagh killings by shooting dead Sir Michael Dwyer ? who was governor of Punjab at the time of the massacre ? in Londons Caxton Hall on March 13, 1940. This was 21 years after General Reginald Edward Harry Dyer had ordered the firing, killing over 1,000 people who had gathered for a peaceful political rally. Udham Singh was hanged at Pentonville prison.

 Like always, the chief minister honoured the martyrs descendants. He promised to give government jobs to two of them.

 Formalities over, Amarinder turned to Opposition-bashing, warning Shiromani Akali Dal leaders against criticising the government.

 He sounded a note of caution for all Opposition leaders, saying he would not allow anyone to disturb law and order in the state.

 The chief minister then asked Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) president and Khalistan ideologue Simranjit Singh Mann to keep from raising anti-national slogans or else pay a heavy price for his utterances.

 Mann is in jail for demanding a state for Sikhs at a programme, held to mark the 21st anniversary of Operation Bluestar, inside the Golden Temple on June 6.

 Punjab has already passed through an ugly phase of terrorism, in which numerous innocents lost their lives, to attain hard-earned peace after almost two decades, Amarinder said.

 Expressing satisfaction with the overall performance of the government, the chief minister claimed that the state had shown remarkable progress.

 We shall announce free power to small and marginal farmers on August 20, the birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi, he said.

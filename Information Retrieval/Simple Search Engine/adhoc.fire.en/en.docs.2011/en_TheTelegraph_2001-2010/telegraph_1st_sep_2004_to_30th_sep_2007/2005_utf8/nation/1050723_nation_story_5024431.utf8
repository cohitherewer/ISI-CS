 Navy touches up friendly face

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, July 22: The navy is setting up a directorate of foreign cooperation after emerging as the service of choice for Indias policies of military diplomacy in the Indian Ocean region even as the first murmurs of discontent on its strategic ambitions wash up at the naval headquarters.

 The chief of naval staff who is also chairman of the chiefs of staff committee, Admiral Arun Prakash, leaves for Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore next week to join the navys aircraft carrier-led flotilla that is now steaming to Southeast Asia. 

 He will convey the message that Indias maritime interests in the Indian Ocean region are friendly.

 The navy chiefs visit was scheduled before Indonesia last week expressed reservations on the Straits of Malacca being patrolled by navies from outside the three countries that flank the busy sea lane of communication.

 Admiral Arun Prakash today took the initiative at a function organised by the journal Force to allay fears of the Indian Navys reach before leaving to join the INS Viraat carrier group that has set sail for the Southeast Asian countries with ships from the eastern fleet. 

 This is the carriers first overseas deployment and is a move designed to showcase the Indian Navys capability. The carrier is also the navys flagship.

 We have no intention of patrolling the Malacca straits. We believe in working with the Singapore, Malaysian and Indonesian navies with whom we have joint programmes, he said.

 Last week, an Indonesian foreign ministry spokesperson said in Jakarta that we wish to make it clear that the Straits of Malacca is not an international strait. It is only for international navigation and the responsibility of its safety lies with Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.

 India has escorted US vessels through the straits and has been repeatedly stating, with some encouragement from the US, that it has an increasing role to play in the Indian Ocean region from the Straits of Hormuz near the Persian Gulf in the west to the Straits of Malacca in the east. 

 The maritime strategy also reflects the Indian foreign ministrys look-east policy. The navy chief said Indian naval vessels had escorted US ships on a specific request from Washington.

 Admiral Prakash said a foreign affairs cell in the naval headquarters was being upgraded to a foreign cooperation directorate. The directorate would look into aspects of maritime diplomacy as well as help shape exchange and training programmes. 

 The directorate was being set up on the advice of and in consultation with the ministry of external affairs and would take initiatives in foreign collaboration. The Indian Navy will have a crucial role to play in concert with our friends, he said.

 The Indian naval ability ? showcased earlier this year in its rapid deployment to tsunami-hit countries in the Indian Ocean region ? and strategy has come in for some criticism particularly after the India-US framework agreement on defence signed during defence minister Pranab Mukherjees visit to the US. Naval headquarters is impressed by Washingtons proclaimed reliance on the Indian Navy as a friendly force capable of dominating the Indian Ocean region and securing the sea lanes of communication through which the heaviest maritime traffic sails.

 The Viraat, two guided missile destroyers, the INS Rajput and the INS Ranjit, a replenishment tanker, the INS Shakti and an indigenously built missile corvette, the INS Khukri, are deployed to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia between July 19 and August 1.

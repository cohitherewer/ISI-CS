 Stay on film release

 Mumbai, Jan. 27 (PTI): Bombay High Court today stayed till February 3 the release of the film Black Friday. The film claims to be the story of the 1993 Mumbai blasts.

 The order came on a petition filed by blast accused Mustafa Moosa Taurani, who argued that the film might prejudice the outcome of the case. 

 On January 24, the special Tada court allowed the makers of the film to withdraw the words ?true story? from its promotional title. Some accused had questioned the tag line ?true story?, pointing out that the judgment was yet to come.

 The serial blasts in March 1993 shattered the city and killed 257 people.

 Cong fight in open

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 23: Infighting in the Congresss Uttar Pradesh unit has spilled out on to the streets.

 Hundreds of party supporters yesterday came out against former state unit president Jagdambika Pal and burnt his effigy for his attack on current chief Salman Khursheed.

 Calling themselves the Khursheed brigade, the supporters assembled in front of the party office and shouted slogans against Pal, demanding his expulsion.

 The reason: On Saturday, during a youth Congress meeting at the state party headquarters, Pal had accused Khursheed of not giving youths adequate representation. He had added that it was shameful the party got just 660 votes in Allahabad, the karmabhumi of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, where an Assembly byelection was held recently.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mamata echo in state

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 4: If Mamata Banerjee throws papers at the deputy Speaker in the Lok Sabha, can her partys MLAs in Calcutta be far behind? 

 The Assembly was discussing the controversial land reforms bill this afternoon when Kanika Ganguly of the CPM wanted to raise a point of order. 

 When deputy Speaker Kripasindhu Saha allowed her, Ganguly brought up Mamatas resignation and accused her of disgracing parliamentary democracy. 

 No Trinamul Congress MLA except Sonali Guha was present. But they heard Ganguly on the speakers in the lobby and rushed in to protest. Led by Pankaj Banerjee, the Trinamul legislators trooped to the Speakers podium, banged tables and flung papers at the deputy Speaker who was in the chair. 

 Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim heard the uproar in his chamber and hurried to the Assembly to control the slogan-shouting MLAs. 

 None of us should refer to any incident and name anyone who is not a member of this House. Ganguly should apologise for what she has said about a person who is not our member. I will examine what she has said and, if necessary, expunge her remarks, Halim said. 

 Later, Pankaj Banerjee justified Mamatas action. She wanted to raise the voice of Bengal inside Parliament, he said. We express our solidarity to our leader and fully support her stand of tendering resignation from the Lok Sabha.

 Party general secretary Partha Chatterjee, also an MLA, went a step ahead and said: If Mamata sticks to her resignation as member of Parliament, her party legislators in the Assembly may follow suit.

 The ruling CPM criticised Mamatas action. 

 She has not done the right thing by throwing papers at the deputy Speaker. Some persons and political parties are viewing the system of parliamentary democracy lightly. Sometime back, Mamatas ally BJP had boycotted Parliament. I believe that she will reconsider her decision and return to the Lok Sabha, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said.

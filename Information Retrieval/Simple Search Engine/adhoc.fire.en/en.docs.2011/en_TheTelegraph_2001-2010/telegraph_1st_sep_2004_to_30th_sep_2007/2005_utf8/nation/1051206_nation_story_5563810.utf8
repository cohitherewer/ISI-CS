 Quizzed Mathrani in cocoon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: Anil Mathrani, the outgoing Croatian ambassador whose purported comments touched off the fresh standoff involving Natwar Singh, today surfaced at the office of the Enforcement Directorate a few hours after the NDA expressed fears about his whereabouts.

 Mathrani, who went into the directorate office located on the fourth floor of Loknayak Bhavan around 12 noon, remained there till 6.30 pm.

 In the evening, he was whisked away from waiting journalists from the basement parking lot of the building in a Delhi police Gypsy with tinted glass.

 Mathrani, clad in a black suit and a pink shirt, looked tired after the six-hour questioning session inside the directorate office, whose grim environs had hit the headlines recently when Andaleeb Sehgal, a close associate of Natwars son Jagat, was questioned on the same issue.

 Mathranis security was tighter than that for Andaleeb and it appeared that police were taking extra care to ensure that the envoy did not interact with the media.

 A few sentences scribbled on a sheet of white paper that Mathrani carried with him to the Gypsy suggested that he had prepared himself to read out a statement to the media.

 Whatever I have to say, I have already informed the ED. I have been requested (rest of the sentence not legible), read the scribbling on the paper.

 Nobody in the Enforcement Directorate was willing to speak about Mathrani, and the media was denied access to the fourth floor, which is usually not out of bounds for journalists.

 The Opposition NDA had earlier in the day accused the government of keeping Mathrani away from the media as part of a cover-up operation. Unaware that the envoy had been taken to the directorate office at noon, some Opposition leaders had said he had been taken out of Delhi. 

 Sources said officials of the Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing, besides directorate officials, were present during the full six hours of questioning.

 Later, Mathrani told a news channel that the questions covered all aspects of the controversy, including what has been published about him in a news magazine. 

 Maintaining that his relationship with Natwar and others in the Congress is cordial, Mathrani said he had asked for a posting back home for personal reasons and was grateful that his wish was granted.

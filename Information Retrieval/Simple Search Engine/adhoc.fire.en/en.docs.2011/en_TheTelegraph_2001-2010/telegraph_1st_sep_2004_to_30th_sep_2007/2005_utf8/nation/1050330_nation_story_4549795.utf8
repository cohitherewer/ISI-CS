 CPI sounds support warning 

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, March 29: The CPI today bared its fangs at the United Progressive Alliance government, saying it has not been given a free mandate to implement ?anti-people? economic policies.

 The party warned the Centre against accepting the US offer of F-16 aircraft and said the government should not take its support from outside for granted by deviating from the common minimum programme.

 ?The US cannot digest the initiatives of the people of both India and Pakistan who are extending their hands of friendship?. They want to start an arms race in the region. They don?t want peace in the region. They offer Pakistan the aircraft first and then tell us we can get it tomorrow. Where were they when we needed their help the most? They don?t want the region to become economically stable,? CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said today.

 Addressing a rally at the Parade Grounds here to kickstart the party?s 19th congress, Bardhan took the Centre to task for pursuing ?anti-people? policies. 

 ?Left parties have tolerated a lot of digression from the UPA?s common minimum programme. Though they need our support to remain in power, it does not mean we turn a blind eye to every move that hurts the people,? the CPI leader said.

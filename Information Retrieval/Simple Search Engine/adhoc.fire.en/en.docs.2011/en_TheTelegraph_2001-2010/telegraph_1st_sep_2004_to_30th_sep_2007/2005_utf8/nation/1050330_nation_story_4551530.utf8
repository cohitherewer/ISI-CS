 New Delhi, March 29 (PTI): India today announced defence acquisitions and upgradations worth Rs 3,820 crore, days after the US cleared the sale of warplanes to Pakistan and made similar offers to Delhi.

 The cabinet committee on security has authorised the defence ministry to carry out price negotiations with Qatar for 12 used French-made Mirage 2005 fighters that have 80-85 per cent of their operational life intact, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said.

 Chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the committee also cleared the induction of nine offshore patrol vessels for the navy, purchase of a C-303 submarine-fired torpedo decoy system from Italy and upgradation of 14 aircraft-carrier-based Sea Harrier planes of British-make.

 Also approved was the time and cost revision for the manufacture of intermediate jet trainers by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd at Rs 467 crore as against the 1997 price of Rs 180 crore, Mukherjee said.

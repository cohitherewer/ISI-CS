 Dalit pays hand price

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Dec. 10: A 32-year-old Dalit had her hand chopped off in a village near here for refusing to take back her complaints of rape against two upper-caste men.

 Madhya Pradesh, which tops the list of crimes against women according to a national crime bureau report, was witness to another incident of brutality earlier this year, when Shakuntala, a supervisor in the women and child welfare department, lost both her arms for trying to prevent child marriage.

 A gang of five armed men yesterday barged into Kamlabais hut in Ningri village in Raisen district, about 120 km from the state capital, superintendent of police J.S. Sanswal said. They thrashed her family members and set her home on fire before hacking Kamlabais right hand with an axe, he added.

 In her statement to Bhopal police, Kamlabai said her husband Prakash fled when the attackers came and started beating up everyone mercilessly. I was left alone in the courtyard. They tied my hands and feet and then chopped off my hand with an axe.

 She has been admitted to the state-run Hamidiya hospital and her condition is serious.

 Kamlabai, who was allegedly raped three years ago, said the five assailants had been threatening her with dire consequences if she did not withdraw two rape complaints against Manmod Mehra and Siyaram Raghuvanshi.

 The police had registered the cases but no arrests were made and her repeated requests for a medical examination went unheard, she said.

 The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognisance of the case and sought a report from the state police. 

 NCW chairperson Girija Vyas said in Delhi that the commission would send a team to the state to investigate the incident. She said she had spoken to state police officials, asking them to provide adequate security to Kamlabai and her family. 

 The commission has also demanded that an FIR be immediately registered and Kamlabais statement recorded by a magistrate, the NCW chairperson said.

 When Shakuntala was made to pay for raising her voice against child marriage in May this year, then chief minister Babulal Gaur sought to dismiss the case suggesting various other motives behind the attack such as personal enmity or even a love affair gone sour. 

 Investigations, however, confirmed that an unidentified man had attacked the social worker at her home in Rajgarh.

 Gaur had to retract his statement and pay Rs 1 lakh as compensation to her.

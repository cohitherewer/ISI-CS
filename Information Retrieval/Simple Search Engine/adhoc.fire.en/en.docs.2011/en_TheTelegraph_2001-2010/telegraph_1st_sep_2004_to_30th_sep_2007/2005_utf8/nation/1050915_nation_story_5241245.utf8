 Shillong IIM flag-off

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The foundation stone of the seventh Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in the country will be laid next month in Shillong either by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

 Meghalaya chief minister D.D. Lapang announced this after a meeting with Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh at Shastri Bhavan here today. 

 The Union human resource development minister has told me that the foundation of the IIM would be laid in October either by the Prime Minister or the Congress president depending on their schedule, Lapang told reporters, adding that Arjun Singh would also be present on the occasion.

 The decision to set up the premier institute in Meghalaya follows a recommendation by the ministry for the Northeast early this month. Assam was the other strong contender in the race for the IIM. It lost out mainly because there is an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Guwahati. The new institute will initially function under one of the established IIMs ?Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Lucknow, Indore or Kozhikode.

 Lapang was part of a 12-member delegation from different states that called on Singh today. They also sought the inclusion of Serampore College in Bengal in the list of universities in the country.

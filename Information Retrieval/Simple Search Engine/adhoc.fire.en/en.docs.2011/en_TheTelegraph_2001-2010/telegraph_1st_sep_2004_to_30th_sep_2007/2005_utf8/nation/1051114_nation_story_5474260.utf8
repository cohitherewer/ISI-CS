 HC clears air on power bill dues

 New Delhi (PTI): The purchaser of a property 

 is not liable to pay electricity arrears of the previous 

 owner as the dues are charged on the user and not the premises, 

 Delhi High Court has ruled.

 The order came on a writ petition filed by a consumer who complained that power supply to his premises was disconnected by the Delhi electricity board for non-payment of the last owners dues.

 The petitioner had contended that he was ignorant of the dues as he had purchased the property in an open auction.

 Justice Vikramjit Sen said the electricity board was unmindful of the fact that arrears could not mount up without the connivance of officials. If disconnection of electric supply is carried out in a timely and prompt manner, arrears would be eliminated, he said.

 The court directed the board to grant a fresh electricity connection to the petitioner within a fortnight and pay him Rs 5,000 towards costs of the case.

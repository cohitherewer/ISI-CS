 Police firing kills engineer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Nov. 29: A mechanical engineer of Hindustan Construction Company leading a band of protesters was killed when a police sub-inspector opened fire, apparently in self-defence, at an outpost in Paradip this morning. 

 The HCC employees led by Mumtaz Ali, 30, attacked the Chakradharpur police outpost around midnight and allegedly assaulted sub-inspector Muralidhar Sahoo.

 They were demanding the release of a colleague, Jayanta Kumar Das, who had been picked up by the police a few hours earlier on charges of stealing from the HCC site office in Paradip, 120 km from here.

 The company is working on the NH-5 (A), also known as the Paradip-Daitari Expressway. The 77-km-long expressway connecting Chandikhol with Paradip, work on which started last year, is likely to be completed by June 2007. Ali was one of the supervisors of the four-lane project.

 Jagatsinghpur police superintendent Y.K. Jethwa said following complaints about a series of thefts of machinery from the HCC office, his men had been patrolling the area last evening when they caught Das red-handed. 

 A few hours after he was brought to the outpost for interrogation, Ali and several others marched in around 1.30 am. They demanded the immediate release of Das, saying he was not involved in the thefts. 

 Though Sahoo tried to reason with them that he would let him off the next morning but only after interrogation, they didnt listen and tried to assault him, Jethwa said.

 When the mob started ransacking the outpost, the sub-inspector fired five rounds from his service revolver of which two hit Ali in the chest.

 Witnesses said Ali collapsed and was declared dead at a local hospital in Atharabanki. His colleague, Nilamadhav Sia, also received a bullet wound on his back and is under treatment at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack.

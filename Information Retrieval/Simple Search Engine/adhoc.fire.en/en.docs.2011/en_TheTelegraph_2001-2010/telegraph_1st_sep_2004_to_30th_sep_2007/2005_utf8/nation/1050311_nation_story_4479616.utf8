 Govt calms milk powder jitters

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 10: The government has said there is no substitute for mother?s milk, allaying fears of health activists that regulations banning advertisement of milk powder for babies will be diluted in the food safety standards bill it hopes to introduce later this year. 

 ?There is a provision in the new food bill to repeal the Infant Milk Substitute Act, which has since 1991 helped to protect, promote and support breastfeeding,? said Dr Arun Gupta of the Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India, a Delhi-based non-government organisation.

 The NGO has been lobbying the government, especially food and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, to ensure that the regulation is not dropped. 

 Pawar has promised Gupta and Dr Tarsem Jindal, a paediatrician and member of the NGO, that the act will not be repealed but amended.

 Jindal said the organisation also went to the National Human Rights Commission, saying infants? right to good health was under threat. The NHRC took up the matter and wrote to the food processing ministry, which will prepare the draft legislation

 The rights panel said in a media release today that the act is not a routine food law but focuses on marketing and other practices that interfere with breastfeeding and thus jeopardises the well-being of babies and mothers. 

 The ministry has assured the commission that there will be no change in the current strictures against the promotion of milk powder as a substitute for mother?s milk. India is one of the few developing nations that has such stringent regulations.

 Nestle, Glaxo and other multinational companies have in the past promoted milk powder as a substitute for breastfeeding in developing nations in Africa and Latin America till NGOs raised their voices.

 Congress turns plane gun on BJP

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, June 16: Stung by the BJPs poser, the Congress has hit back with plane facts.

 Spokesman Anand Sharma said if his party has to explain why Sonia Gandhi used an aircraft of the Reliance group to travel to Russia, the same applied to the BJP.

 The Opposition party, he added, should give details of senior leader Jaswant Singhs flight back from Israel on June 9. The former foreign minister had availed an aircraft of the same industrial house.

 We would not have spoken about it because leaders of all political parties hire private aircraft belonging to one or the other industrial groups for travel within the country and outside from time to time, the spokesman said. But since a needless controversy is being sought to be created over the Congress presidents travel, they must also account for their using private aircraft.

 The BJP, he said, is behaving in a very petty-minded manner because it is desperate to divert attention from its internal troubles.

 Sharma said his party chief travelled by the Reliance groups Global Express aircraft because of convenience and security reasons and that it could have been an aircraft of any other industrial group.

 He also made it clear that the party had made an advance payment of Rs 12 lakh on June 2 and if the company submitted a bill for more, that too would be settled.

 In the other camp, BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar promised to share all details of Singhs use of the private aircraft.

 Sharma dismissed questions about the status of Sonias visit and in what capacity foreign minister K. Natwar Singh had accompanied her. The fact is that her visit is of immense national significance as Sonia went as a personal guest of President Vladimir Putin, he said.

 The spokesman added that it was proper that the foreign minister accompanied the central coalitions chairperson on such a significant visit to a country, which has been Indias time-tested friend and a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

 On reports that the Prime Minister violated protocol by visiting the airport to see off Sonia, Sharma said Manmohan Singhs gesture was voluntary.

 The Prime Minister, he added, wanted to make it clear that he would not like to be a prisoner of protocol.

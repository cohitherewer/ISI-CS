 Snow fury kills seven jawans

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Feb. 7: An avalanche triggered by a fierce snowstorm killed seven troopers early this morning after it swept down on their camp near Jawahar tunnel, the Valley?s only link across the Pir Panjal mountains with the rest of the country.

 Officials said five Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force jawans were rescued while seven were still missing.

 ?Seven members of the paramilitary force died on the spot, five were rescued in critical condition while seven are still missing. We were forced to discontinue the rescue operation following blizzards in the area today which might trigger another avalanche. It is snowing heavily,? a police officer said.

 ?It is after many years that an avalanche of this magnitude was triggered in the vicinity of the tunnel that forms the only connection across the Pir Panjal mountains between the Valley and the rest of the country,? he added.

 Kashmir zone inspector-general of police Javed Mukhdoomi said the avalanche buried at least three barracks of the border force.

 The strategic Srinagar-Jammu National Highway has been closed and authorities said dozens of vehicles are stranded. A thick white blanket of snow covered the capital city.

 In Himachal Pradesh, heavy snowfall in the higher reaches and rains in the lower hills affected road traffic and power supply, according to PTI reports. Manali, Dalhousie, Kufri and Narkanda received 30-50 cm of fresh snowfall. An avalanche threat loomed over high-altitude tribal areas.

 The 350-km Indo-Tibet and Kullu-Manali national highways and several link roads in the higher reaches of Shimla, Kullu, Chamba and Mandi districts were closed after heavy snowfall.

 In Lahaul district, three members of a family were killed in an avalanche, official sources said. Their bodies have not been found yet.

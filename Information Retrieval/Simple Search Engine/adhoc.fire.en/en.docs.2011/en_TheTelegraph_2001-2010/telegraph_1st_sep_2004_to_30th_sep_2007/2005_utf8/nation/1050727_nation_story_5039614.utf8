 Kashmir returns to sport, after 14 years

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, July 26: After a 14-year gap, Kashmir saw the participation of its youth in an inter-district sports tournament covering as many as 15 disciplines.

 In various phases of the successfully conducted state sports event, 1,044 girls, between the age of 14 and 17, from all districts took part.

 The meet featured cricket, basketball, handball, volleyball, kho-kho and kabaddi.

 Today, on the concluding day of the meet, Yogesh Sawhney, the minister of state for sports and youth services had words of appreciation for the state government and the sports department that organised the event which saw students from even border districts of Kupwara, Kargil and Leh participating.

 Our youth have faced a lot of difficulty during the period of turmoil, Sawhney said, adding that the event was possible because of the efforts of the present government, which has created an atmosphere of peace and prosperity in the state and enabled the students to come forward and take part in sports activities. 

 The minister said physical education was important for children and the present government has made sports a compulsory subject in educational institutions.

 Sports took a beating in Kashmir after militancy gripped the state. Stadiums, playgrounds and other sports facilities remained shut all along.

 But now, a local youth hostel that was occupied by security forces has been vacated and rebuilt to cater to the accommodation needs of sportsmen during competitions in the summer capital.

 Sports department officials said revival of sports activities was a top priority of the state government to channelise the energy of the states youth and hone their talents.

 Trial over ?attack? begins

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, May 3: The trial of former minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA from Belaganj Surendra Prasad Yadav today began in the court of R.R. Mishra, the judicial magistrate of Gaya.

 Surendra Prasad, along with Gaya Zilla Parishad chairman Bindi Yadav, deputy mayor of Gaya Municipal Corporation Bachchu Yadav and others, have been accused of attacking the residence of former MLA Jai Kumar Palit in 1991. 

 The former minister is lodged in Gaya Central Jail at present.

 Mohan Lal Rajak, then officer-in-charge of Civil Lines police station, was produced as the first witness. According to court sources, the police officer confirmed his signature on the FIR and told the court that sub-inspector Ayodhya Prasad was entrusted with the investigation of the case.

 Senior criminal lawyer Syed Qaiser Sharfuddin is representing Surendra Prasad. Palit, whose deposition is of prime importance, is likely to be produced for the next hearing on May 10.

 Palit, it may be recalled, had entered into a compromise with Surendra Prasad and submitted a compromise petition on October 18, 2001. He stated that the dispute had been amicably resolved out of court and he no longer nursed any ill-feeling.

 The petition was rejected as the alleged offence was of a serious nature and a compromise was possible only in minor cases. Surendra Prasad surrendered before the court on February 4, more than 13 years after the case was instituted in November 1991.

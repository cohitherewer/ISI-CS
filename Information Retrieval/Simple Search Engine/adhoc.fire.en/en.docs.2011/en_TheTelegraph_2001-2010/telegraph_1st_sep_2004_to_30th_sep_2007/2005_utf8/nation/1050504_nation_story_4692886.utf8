 Disney meet with PM fuels ?happy? buzz

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, May 3: Corporate America woke up this morning to intense speculation that India is about to become the next ?happiest place on earth?.

 The speculation stems from a meeting last week between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and two Walt Disney Co. executives: chief executive Michael Eisner and chief operating officer Robert Iger, who is to succeed Eisner in September.

 ?The happiest place on earth? is Disney?s catchline for describing its world of resorts, theme parks, cruises, vacation clubs and much more.

 A Hong Kong publication got word of the meeting between the Prime Minister and the two Disney executives.

 On Sunday, it came out with a report quoting an unnamed official of the urban development ministry in New Delhi as saying: ?Disney has approached us for land outside Delhi to build a theme park.

 ?The company is very upbeat about the project. Its top officials are lobbying hard to wangle a very, very big plot.?

 By the time news travelled half way across the world from Hong Kong to California and Disney executives returned from the weekend to their offices yesterday, they were in a tizzy.

 Jay Rasulo, president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, hastily put out a statement to say that ?we have not had any discussions in India regarding the opening of a theme park or purchasing land and do not plan any in the foreseeable future?.

 On reconsideration, Disney spokesperson Michele Nachum decided to be more cautious, but also a little more forthcoming, even if between the lines. She confirmed the meeting between the Prime Minister and her two bosses but pre-empted any questions by insisting that she did not know what they discussed.

 Nachum would not confirm whether Disney proposed to build a theme park in India and limited herself to corporate hyperbole. ?We are constantly evaluating strategic markets around the world to grow our parks and resorts business and the Disney brand.?

 The Hong Kong publication, meanwhile, quoted a spokesperson for the Prime Minister as saying: ?Nobody asks the Prime Minister for land. It was a courtesy call.?

 The Prime Minister?s spokesperson and Disney?s spokesperson are both right.

 An American corporate executive would be dumb to call on the Prime Minister in New Delhi and ask for land...unless he is someone as arrogant as the late Enron?s Kenneth Lay, who wrote to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee threatening a low in Indo-US relations unless his company?s troubles in India were sorted out.

 Nachum did not deny that Disney was planning a theme park in India. She merely left open the possibility that it may or may not be so.

 Disney is to inaugurate its newest theme park in Hong Kong in September, a few days before Eisner steps down as chief executive.

 According to America?s corporate grapevine, there may be two reasons why Disney is coy about its plans for India.

 There is speculation here that once its Hong Kong venture opens, Disney would like to set up a similar venture in Shanghai and is negotiating with Chinese authorities for the green light for that theme park. The company may not want to talk of any other project to interfere with its focus on Shanghai.

 A second reason may be the company?s corporate problems. Eisner has been under fire for a year from shareholders and board members and finally announced his resignation last September, making way for Iger to take over as chief executive in about five months.

 No one at Disney may want to rock anything with talk of new commitments or ambitious schemes in this transition phase.

 Started as a cartoon studio in 1923 that produced Mickey Mouse and Snowhite animations, The Walt Disney Co. is the most popular name in the world for family entertainment.

 Seven of its 10 theme parks are among the most visited by tourists worldwide. Disney owns ABC television and radio, the ESPN cable network and the popular Disney Channel.

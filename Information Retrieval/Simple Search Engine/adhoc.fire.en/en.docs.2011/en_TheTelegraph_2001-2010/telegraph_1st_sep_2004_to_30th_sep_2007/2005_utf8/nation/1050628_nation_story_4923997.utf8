 Shimla/Chandigarh, June 27: The raging Sutlej ebbed a bit overnight but thousands of tourists and residents remained stranded along the banks of the river that has washed away parts of a national highway and several bridges and houses in Himachal Pradesh.

 A few kilometres from the border with China, soldiers involved in rescue operations spotted six bodies, said to be of Chinese nationals, floating down the river near Sumdoh, the last inhabited village in Himachals Kinnaur district.

 Himachal revenue minister Sat Mahajan said the state government has put the damage at Rs 800 crore. The national highway (NH-22), the lifeline of the region, has been destroyed at various places. Several bridges, houses and farmlands have been washed away.

 Mahajan said 4,600 people living on the banks of the Sutlej have been evacuated and added that chief minister Virbhadra Singh has left for Delhi for a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Kinnaur district magistrate Amandeep Garg said around 400 tourists, including 40 foreigners, are stranded and efforts are on to airlift them as soon as the weather clears. Efforts are also being made to restore the communication system, which has been paralysed, Garg added.

 In Kinnaur alone, 13 bridges have been washed away and six others have damaged, Garg said.

 Despite the slight improvement in the situation, the security alert remained in place. Even though the Sutlej waters have started receding, we are constantly monitoring the level for a possible rise. The red alert in a 200-km area downstream in Kinnaur, Shimla, Bilaspur and Mandi districts continues., Mahajan said.

 The 1,500-mw Nathpa Jhakri hydropower project, which supplies electricity to Delhi and eight northern states, remained shut, resulting in a shortfall of 36 million units.

 A senior engineer of the project said the plant was expected to resume generation within the next 48 hours as the silt level in the rivers water was coming down.

 Officers of the Western Command, which is co-ordinating relief efforts, however, warned that the danger was not over yet. 

 The river could again rise due to the melting of snow on account of high temperatures. We are keeping a close watch. Maximum alert is being maintained, said an officer.

 Major General R.S. Gill said the army, which has already rushed two columns to the affected areas, would send more if needed.

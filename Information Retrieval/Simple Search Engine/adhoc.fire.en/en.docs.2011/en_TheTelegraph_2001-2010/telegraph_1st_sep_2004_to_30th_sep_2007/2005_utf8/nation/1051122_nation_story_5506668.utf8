 Denel in court to stall refund

 Durban (PTI): South African arms manufacturer Denel, which recently lost a multi-billion-dollar contract to India following allegations of corruption, will ask Johannesburg High Court on Tuesday to stop a refund payment of more than $5.5 million to the Indian government.

 The company obtained an interim order last Friday to stop one of the top banks in the country from making the payment. 

 The Indian government had made an advance payment of $10.1 million in 2003 and wanted a portion of this money refunded by last Friday. Denel, in its application, wanted the payment to be stopped until its case was heard on Tuesday. 

 The South African government is understood to be negotiating with the Indian government about the cancelled deal.

 Double raise for Delhi MLAs

 delhi (PTI): The salaries of Delhi MLAs have been more than doubled, bringing them on a par with the pay packet of ministers.

 Delhi ministers, who take home around Rs 24,000, have also been given a raise of around Rs 11,000. The chief ministers salary, however, remains the same ? Rs 37,000.

This increase has come after a gap of five years. It was indeed needed and there had been a demand for it for a long time.

 Deoghar/Calcutta, Sept. 14: The 18-year-old who was gang-raped on the Toofan Express yesterday has named another ticket examiner in her first information report to police.

 Anil Kumar, the additional divisional railway manager, Asansol, said the girl told the police that another travelling ticket examiner was present in the coach and was involved in the incident.

 The girl, he added, was travelling without a ticket.

 The police said the girl, who was in a first class compartment of the Howrah-bound Udayan-Abha Toofan Express, was raped between Jhajha and Jasidih stations, a distance covered in 45 to 60 minutes by express trains. She was found in a semi-conscious state near Madhupur in Deoghar district.

 Medical examinations have confirmed that the girl, now admitted to a hospital in Madhupur, was drugged and then raped by several men.

 Railway sources said there were no Railway Protection Force personnel in the compartment when the rape took place. RPF escorts are only provided at night, an official said.

 Government Railway Police spokesmen Nurul Huda and Sidho Hembrom said the travelling ticket examiner and the coach attendants had persuaded the girl to move to the first class compartment in Jhajha and offered her food spiked with sedatives.

 Two of the accused, coach attendant Md Aslam and ticket examiner D.N. Upadhyay, have been detained after the girl named them. Both have denied their involvement in the crime.

 Efforts are on to arrest another ticket examiner, K.K. Singh, who boarded the train with Upadhyay from Jhajha, and two other coach attendants, Md Zafar and Nayeemuddin.

 Family members of the teenager said this was not the first time she had left home.

 My daughter fled from home earlier and was traced to Salt Lake from where she was brought back a few days ago, he said from Barsara, a village in Bengals Hooghly district. But even before entering the house, she quarrelled with her brother and left again.

 The girls brother left for Madhupur tonight.

 Two years ago, she fled to Varanasi from where she was rescued by the police. A few months later, she went missing again and was found in Bengals Burdwan district.

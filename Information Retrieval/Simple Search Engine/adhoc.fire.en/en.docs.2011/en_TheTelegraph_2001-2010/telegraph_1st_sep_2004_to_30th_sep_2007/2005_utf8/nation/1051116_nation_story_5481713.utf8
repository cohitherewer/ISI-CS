 Kushboo in court, to be back

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kushboo

 Chennai, Nov. 15: Tamil actress Kushboo today appeared in a magistrates court in Mettur in connection with her recent controversial comment on pre-marital sex.

 When told the magistrate was not present, the actress, against whom a non-bailable warrant had been issued, recorded her presence in the register and said she would be back tomorrow. 

 I respect the law and I will appear before the judge tomorrow, Kushboo, whose whereabouts were kept secret the last two days, said before leaving.

 Kushboos comment, which appeared to condone pre-marital sex, triggered howls of protests for denigrating Tamil womanhood and Tamil culture.

 Chennai police commissioner R. Natraj, to whom the warrant had been handed over, did not rush to execute it as the actress had applied for anticipatory bail in Madras High Court. A ruling on the plea is pending.

 In a U-turn, popular actress Suhasini Manirathnam, who had defended Kushboos remarks, expressed regrets for her comments and wanted the entire episode to be treated as a bad dream.

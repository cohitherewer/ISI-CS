 Shourie fights Centaur sale slur

 New Delhi, May 5: Arun Shourie today dared the Centre to hold an ?open? inquiry into the Juhu Centaur transaction, which was allegedly undervalued before being sold off during his tenure as disinvestment minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.

 Shourie, a BJP Rajya Sabha member, accused finance minister P. Chidambaram of making the sale an ?issue? on the strength of a report by a ?handpicked? former government official, S. Laxminarayanan. He demanded that the report be made public.

 In the Lok Sabha yesterday, Chidambaram had accused Shourie of having taken an ?active interest? in processing the sale of the hotel, which was owned by the Hotel Corporation of India, an Air-India subsidiary. He was responding to a calling-attention motion by CPM member Basudeb Acharya on the way the hotel was divested in 2002. 

 Acharya had sought to know how the hotel was evaluated, why it was sold for Rs 153 crore when the current value was over Rs 350 crore, whether a person on the Air-India board was both seller and buyer, and why the Centre did not invoke the bank guarantee once it was clear the hotel had been ?undervalued?.

 Chidambaram told the House that Tulip Hospitality Services was the lone bidder and had offered Rs 153 crore against the reserve price of Rs 101.60 crore. Ajit Kerkar, Tulips owner, was on the Air-India board when it decided to set up an advisory sub-committee on the Centaur disinvestment. On its recommendation, the carrier appointed a consultant. When the board was reconstituted a day later, Kerkar was not on it.

 Chidambaram said Shouries disinvestment ministry had twice decided to invoke the bank guarantee as Tulip was unable to pay the committed amount, but, after a meeting between Shourie and Kerkar on February 22, 20002, a consortium of public sector banks loaned Rs 129 crore to Tulip.

 Shourie today said there can be no ?consensus? on valuations, which were commercial decisions. The recommendation to sell Centaur was made by Chidambaram as finance minister in 1997, he added. 

 The former minister denied helping to arrange money for Kerkar but admitted the deadline for payment was relaxed twice. The government, he explained, did not wish to lose the ?extra money? that Tulip had quoted for the property. 

 But Shourie could not two answer questions: Why Kerkar was allowed to bid after having been on the Air-India board virtually a day before the deal got going, and why the property was under-valued.

 Schools to carry girl-fee load

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: The Centre today made it clear it would not subsidise the new scheme to provide free education to girls who are the only child of their parents from Class VI to Class XII in CBSE schools.

 We are not reimbursing the money. The schools will have to cross-subsidise to meet the cost, said a human resource development ministry official. He added that the schools should easily be able to buffer this (slide in income) since very few children will fall in this category.

 The ministry has carried out a sample survey among CBSE schools in and outside Delhi to prove its point.

 The sample shows there wont be more than 5-10 girl students (per school) in the category specified by the scheme, the official said. Cross-subsidisation would mean that children from affluent families will have to pay a higher fee.

 The Centre yesterday announced a slew of schemes, to be sponsored by the CBSE and the UGC, to promote education among girls and restore the declining status of the girl child.

 The fee-waiver scheme for girls from one-child families now covers only CBSE schools. We will try to persuade other boards, too, to accept the scheme, the official said. 

 The ministry has started a discussion with ICSE and does not foresee any major problems in getting the scheme through. All states are represented on the ICSE board; and we have the majority on our side, the official said.

 The ministry says it does not want to force the scheme on ICSE or state boards. We always use persuasive measures. There is no question of foisting our view on the states, the official said.

 The Centre wants the schools to start the scheme as soon as they can, preferably from this financial year. But there is no hard and fast rule about this year, he said.

 The government hopes the scheme will help correct the distorted sex ratio in the country, particularly in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana.

 Our target is the well-to-do middle class, which is practising female foeticide. We also want to root out the tendency to prefer sons to daughters, the official said.

 Apart from the fee-waiver, the Centre has suggested a plan to provide a scholarship every year to girls from one-child families from Class VI or Class IX onwards. 

 The amount could be Rs 4,000 per year and it could be given to the girl through the school either in the form of a fixed deposit or by transferring the amount to an account in her name, he said.

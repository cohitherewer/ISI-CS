 Chief secretary cracks fund whip

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 2: Expressing concern over unsatisfactory plan spending in the current fiscal, Orissa chief secretary Subas Pani has directed the secretaries of various state departments to expedite the utilisation of allocated funds. 

 The government has so far spent only 60 per cent of the plan outlay of Rs 2,500 crore for the current fiscal. In the case of externally-aided projects, the utilisation is a mere 40 per cent.

 The original plan for 2004-05 had been pegged at Rs 3,250 crore, which was later revised to Rs 2,500 crore. By the end of December 2004, various state government departments and public sector undertakings managed to spend only Rs 1,482.32 crore, which is about 59.29 per cent of the outlay.

 In the original outlay, Rs 2,963.56 crore had been earmarked for various schemes, which was later revised to Rs 2213.56 crore. Of it, Rs 1,447.13 crore has been utilised so far. The public sector undertakings have spent Rs 35.18 crore, which makes up 12.28 per cent of the revised plan for the PSUs.

 The departments with low expenditure are industries (12.19 percent), housing and urban development (32.85), ST/SC development (38.5) energy (43.07), agriculture (51.72) and health (47.91). 

 The progress of the state in the fields of immunisation, housing and plantation and others was below par. 

 Reviewing the progress of several government schemes yesterday, Pani directed the senior officials of the departments concerned to improve their performance.

 The expenditure related to the Centre-sponsored Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojana was also unsatisfactory, Pani said. Of the revised allocation of Rs 108.63 crore for 2004-05, the implementing departments have spent Rs 37.97 crore, which accounts for only 34.95 per cent and submitted utilisation certificates (UC) for Rs 16.33 crore. 

 UCs for Rs 44.83 crore for the period 2000-01 to 2003-04 are still pending with five departments.

 With the Planning Commission issuing repeated reminders, the secretaries have been asked to submit the pending utilisation certificates within 15 days.

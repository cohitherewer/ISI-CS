 Surrender, but not over riot 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Oct. 25: Independent MLA Mukhtar Ansari surrendered today, giving a respite to the ruling Samajwadi Party that has been facing a barrage of criticism for his alleged hand in riots in Mau town in east Uttar Pradesh.

 Ten people died and at least 200 were injured in the riot during the last two weeks. Police arrested 405 people before they got a grip on the situation in Mau.

 Refusing to budge from the stand that he was innocent, Ansari obliged the state government by surrendering in court in connection with a nine-year-old case in Gazipur in which he was wanted for firing at an additional superintendent of police for stopping his vehicle for a search.

 The Mau superintendent of police now would file an application in the Gazipur court seeking remand of Ansari in connection with the riot case, said home secretary Aloke Sinha. He will then be interrogated in connection with the cases of murder and provocation to rioting.

 Ansari, who is facing 16 criminal cases, drove to the court this morning with his supporters before giving himself up at the fast-track court of the additional sessions judge. The court remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days.

 Even while surrendering, Ansari pleaded innocence on the charges of rioting and murder and demanded a CBI probe. He was politically isolated as a major section of the Samajwadi Party in Mau were against him and wanted him arrested.

 Ansari reportedly threatened to snap ties with the Samajwadi Party if the police dared to pick him up. The message from Ansari and his MP brother Afzal was clear: arrest would hurt Muslim votes. Afzal is a Samajwadi Party MP. They took exception to chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs statement early last week that the MLA would be arrested.

 Even as Ansari had the police searching all over, he reportedly stayed put in Lucknow till a deal was brokered between Asraf Zaman, a Mau-based leader, and the MLAs brother over the surrender.

 A senior police officers suggestion that Ansari could surrender in connection with an old case to help the police give up the chase and avoid the embarrassment of not finding him was accepted. He and his MP brother informed Mulayam Singh about his decision to give up.

 The ruling party is expected to take this opportunity to mount pressure on the BJP legislator from Mau, Ramji Singh, for surrender or arrest. We will arrest Singh, DGP Yash Pal Singh said. 

 Singhs name figured in FIRs drawn up in connection with the riot and Singh was daring the police to arrest him.

 The Opposition dismissed the surrender as a clumsily staged plot to hide the truth about the riot.

 Security watch on tourists

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, March 6: Tightening security arrangements in the region, police today asked hotels and lodges to furnish details about guests putting up at their establishments.

 The meetings were held at police stations in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong, Siliguri and Matigara, among others. 

 ?The aim was to make the hoteliers aware of the possibility that their establishments could be used as safe houses by the KLO, Ulfa and Maoists,? said superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra.

 ?We, especially, want information on suspicious visitors who put up at hotels frequently and are able to pay hefty bills without apparently seeming to have the means to do so. Such people could have links with extremist or anti-social activities,? he explained. 

 According to J. Haldar, a manager of a leading hotel in Siliguri, hoteliers already had to submit daily reports on all foreigners registering at the hotels to the district intelligence bureau. 

 The meetings come after Siliguri police made it mandatory, two weeks ago, for all landlords in the trading town to furnish details about their tenants, including names, family members, occupation and permanent addresses. 

 Though both measures existed before, they were not being strictly enforced. It was only after two Nepal Maoists were arrested from a flat in a Siliguri locality recently that the police force decided to strengthen security measures.

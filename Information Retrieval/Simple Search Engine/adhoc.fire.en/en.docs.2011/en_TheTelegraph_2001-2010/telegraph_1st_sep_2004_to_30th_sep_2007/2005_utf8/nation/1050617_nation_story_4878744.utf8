 Chengalpattu (Tamil Nadu), June 16: The district and sessions court has said it will go ahead with the framing of charges in the Shankar Raman murder case unless the Supreme Court gives an interim order on Kanchi acharya Jayendra Saraswatis petition seeking transfer of the trial outside Tamil Nadu.

 Jayendra Saraswati and junior pontiff Vijayendra Saraswati are among the prime accused in the murder of Shankar Raman, the manager of Sri Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kancheepuram. The pontiffs are now out on bail.

 I have to frame the charges, the district and sessions judge, J.M. Akbar Ali, said in the packed courtroom in Chengalpattu, 59 km from Chennai. The judge said he now had to post the matter for the next stage.

 Ali then posted the matter to July 12 and told the counsel that I will hear you before framing the charges.

 Jayendra Saraswatis counsel K.S. Dinakaran told the court that a petition was pending in the Supreme Court seeking transfer of the case outside Tamil Nadu, prompting the judge to reply: Yes, the court is aware of it.

 However, Ali was quick to add that the pending petition could not be a reason for not going ahead with proceedings in the trial court, unless there is a specific order from the Supreme Court.

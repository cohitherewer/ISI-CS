 Buta advisers on hold

 ALOKE TIKKU

 Singh: Kept waiting

 New Delhi, March 24: Bihar governor Buta Singh is unlikely to get his advisers in a hurry.

 The Centre is inclined to hold the appointment of retired bureaucrats and police officers as advisers to the Patna Raj Bhavan and, instead, wait for its two Bihar allies to reconcile and install a UPA government in the state.

 ?Time is a great healer...it has the potential to heal the deepest of wounds,? a senior Union minister said, referring to the Congress-led Centre?s hope that Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan would set aside their differences and strike a compromise in due course.

 The Centre also feels that it would risk more bad blood if one ally?s opinion is given precedence over the other?s as both seek an active role in selecting advisers.

 Also, the Centre and the Congress leadership feel that the political situation in Bihar is not beyond reconciliation.

 Appointing advisers at this stage would not only need Singh to share his current powers but also give President?s rule a semblance of permanency.

 ?You would appoint advisers if you believed that the state was going to be under President?s rule for a considerable period,? an official said.

 The Congress-led Centre is trying to bridge differences between its two allies. It is in this context that home minister Shivraj Patil has emphasised that the Bihar mandate is not in favour of any party but is in favour of a secular formation. This, he told the Rajya Sabha early this week, was beyond doubt.

 Patil has also been arguing that there is no constitutional requirement for advisers but his government will appoint them if necessary.

 Under such circumstances, the Centre would like to make its presence felt only if the political situation reaches a point of no-return. An assessment is likely after a final attempt at reconciliation is made, possibly after Parliament?s budget session.

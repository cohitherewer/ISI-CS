The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rivals pitch in for Indore pitch

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Will Sachin Play in indore again?

 Indore, July 11: When the wicket is bad, players need to dig in.

 What if the outfield also happens to be a grazing ground for cows?

 Realising that a straight bat alone is not the answer, political adversaries have shrugged off their rivalry to do their bit for Indore, which earned notoriety twice and was on the verge of losing its status as an international cricket venue.

 What is heartening is that in spite of their political differences, they came forward to help us out, says former national selector Sanjay Jagdale.

 Arjun Singh, Vikram Verma, H.R. Bhardwaj, Maya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Laxmi Narain Sharma and Praful Maheshwari have all pitched in with money from their MPs local area development funds for a new stadium.

 While Union ministers Arjun Singh and Bhardwaj, Congress MP Maheshwari and the BJPs Verma contributed Rs 15 lakh each, Vermas colleague Maya Singh donated Rs 20 lakh. Sharma, also a BJP MP, contributed Rs 5 lakh.

 The initiative, Jagdale says, came from Scindia, the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association chairman, who wrote to all MPs from the state to help out with money.

 The across-the-divide effort to help Indore retain its status came after a match with Sri Lanka was abandoned and another incident in 2001. 

 On December 25, 1997, an India-Sri Lanka tie had to be converted into a 25-overs-a-side exhibition game after the two captains, Arjuna Ranatunga and Sachin Tendulkar, refused to carry on with the one-day international, which was barely three overs old.

 While the 25,000-plus crowd expected a game, match referee A.M. Ebrahim of Zimbabwe had no choice but to agree with the two captains. The problem was not only with the wicket. The outfield, as hard as concrete, was worse: there were little clumps of grass all over.

 Ranatunga and Tendulkar, however, agreed to play a 25-overs-a-side exhibition match on an adjoining strip, and saved the state association and the Indian cricket board from utter embarrassment.

 Four years later, Indore was the venue of the third ODI between India and Australia. As the Australians settled for their pre-match breakfast, they were stunned to see an old lady with a wicker basket, scooping cow-dung from the ground as a cow walked along.

 Jagdale says such incidents are a thing of the past. We are now going to have a state-of-the-art cricket stadium in Indore ready to greet visiting South Africa and England, he says. 

 The new stadium, which is 80 per cent complete, will be owned by the state cricket association and not the Indore municipal corporation, which owns the earlier one.

 The money from the MPs fund would be used to build roads and the boundary wall. 

 The MPCA has its own funds which come from gate money, sponsorships and the BCCIs infrastructure assistance. The contribution and patronage from politicians help us in getting things done, be it at the municipal, state or the central government level, Jagdale says.

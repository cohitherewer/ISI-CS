 Dance bar cry

 Mumbai, Aug. 16: A number of petitions against the ban on dance bars, that came into force on Sunday, have been filed in Bombay High Court .

 The Fight for Rights Bar Owners Association filed a petition today alleging the bill, passed last week, was discriminatory and was passed at the instigation of the five-star lobby in the city. Two other petitions challenging the ban were filed by the Association of Hotels and Restaurants (AHAR) and a bar customer. 

 Fight for Rights president Manjit Singh Sethi demanded a CBI probe into the circumstances that led to the ban on dance bars in the state. Money has changed hands from the five-star hotels to the ruling party, he said.

 Those who opposed the ban said if discos, nightclubs and pubs could continue, there was no reason why dance bars should not.

 The petition, which seeks a stay on the ban, will be heard tomorrow, said Pravin Agarwal, lawyer for Fight for Rights. The other two petitions will be heard together with it. 

 The dance bar bill has rendered 10 lakh people dependent on the industry jobless, said Manjit Singh Abrol, who represented AHAR. The bill bans holding of a performance of dance, of any kind, in eating houses, permit rooms or beer bars. But bar-owners said they would try to get around it by organising orchestras or disco parties within the bars.

 The dance bar womens association, Bhartiya Bar Girls Union, which has about 12,000 members, will file another petition in the court tomorrow against the ban.

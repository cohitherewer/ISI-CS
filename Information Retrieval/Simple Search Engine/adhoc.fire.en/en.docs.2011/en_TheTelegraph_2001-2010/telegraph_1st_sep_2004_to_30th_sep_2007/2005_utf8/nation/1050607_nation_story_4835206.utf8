 Flying Tigers trigger alarm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 6: The air forces of India and Sri Lanka are worried after truce monitors in the island nation reported that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has built an airstrip.

 The militant outfit already has a naval wing called the Sea Tigers and its active development of the air wing dubbed Flying Tigers has motivated the Lankan defence establishment to send a high-level team to New Delhi today.

 We are concerned (at reports of the LTTE airstrip) and we are keeping a watch. But we cannot do anything unless we are asked, said the assistant chief of staff (operations) at the air headquarters, Air Vice-Marshal Sumit Mukherjee. 

 The Sri Lankan defence delegation is understood to be holding talks on, among other issues, security of the airspace of Sri Lanka and south India.

 The Sri Lankan defence team follows on the footsteps of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who is also understood to have expressed her worry on the LTTEs capabilities to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Last month, the Norwegian head of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission that is keeping a watch on the truce talks in the country, Hagrup Haukland, reported that the LTTE had acquired an airstrip.

 The press in Sri Lanka has reported that the LTTE airstrip was on the Alpha Nine motorway between Kandy and Jaffna. It has also been reported that the LTTE has assembled two light aircraft by procuring components from multiple sources and also a helicopter.

 We have seen the airstrip from the air while flying on a Sri Lankan military helicopter in May last year, Haukland was quoted as having told foreign correspondents in Colombo on May 27.

 The acquisition of air assets by the LTTE is seen as a threat by both the Sri Lankan Air Force and the IAF. The security of the airspace of Sri Lanka and India is the responsibility of the two air forces. 

 Acquisition of air assets means that the militant outfit was acquiring strategic depth and capabilities that would not only bolster its military, that mainly comprises guerrilla fighters, but also bring air assets of Sri Lanka and India within its target range. Haukland himself had mentioned such a possibility.

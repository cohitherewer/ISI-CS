 Aamir rises again on TV

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: After the rising, the art of living. Aamir Mangal Pandey Khan will hit the small screen in a new avatar.

 Coca-Cola will unleash its new television commercial with Aamir preaching the chin-up way of living, both as narrator as well as protagonist.

 The campaign ? Coca-Cola, Piyo Sar Utha Ke ? will be off the blocks tomorrow and will continue to show throughout the festival season going beyond the New Year celebrations. Coke officials said the 45-second ad seeks to connect the consumer at a deep emotional level. 

 Industry observers, however, contended that the new campaign from Coke was long overdue to counter the Oye Bubbly campaign by rival Pepsi, featuring Shahrukh Khan.

 They said depending on the success of the new campaign, a quick riposte from Pepsi should not be surprising. This will be Aamirs second big commercial in recent times after Toyota Innova.

 Officials of the Atlanta-headquartered beverage major said the new campaign does not deviate from Aamirs earlier campaigns for Coke. In the previous Coke ads, Aamir enacted the roles of an ordinary Indian from various states ? a Bengali bhadralok, a Punjabi farmer and a Sherpa.

 Every marketer in a campaign dreams to capture the fascination of the common man. The new campaign captures the positively uplifting moments of our daily lives, a Coca-Cola India official said.

 The creative idea builds off the fact that we look up to drink a bottle of Coca-Cola, and we also look up in lifes other special moments. The campaign encapsulates the mood and magic of these moments in a powerful montage.

 The commercial is created by McCann Erickson and written by its national creative director Prasoon Joshi. 

 It has been directed by Shoojit Sircar, the director of Yahaan.

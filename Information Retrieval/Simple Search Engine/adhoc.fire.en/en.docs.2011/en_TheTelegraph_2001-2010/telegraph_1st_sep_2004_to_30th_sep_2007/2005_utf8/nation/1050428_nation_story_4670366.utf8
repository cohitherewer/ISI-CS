 Ground staff on flash strike

 New Delhi, April 27: Air-India service engineers and ground staff went on a flash strike today in protest against the postponement of union elections. The strike, which began at 6 am, grounded at least one flight and delayed four others before it was called off.

 Three of the flights ? one each to Singapore, Chicago and New York ? left two to three hours behind schedule. 

 It also sparked a row in Parliament within the Left parties. CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta asked civil aviation minister Praful Patel to protect the rights of his employees. But CPM members said factional unions should not be encouraged.

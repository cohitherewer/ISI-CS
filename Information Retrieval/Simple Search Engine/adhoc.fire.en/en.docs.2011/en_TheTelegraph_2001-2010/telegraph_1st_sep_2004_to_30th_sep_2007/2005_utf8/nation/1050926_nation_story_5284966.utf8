 School bill cost worry for states

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: State governments want more discussion on the free and compulsory education bill the Centre is keen to introduce in the next session of Parliament.

 The human resource development ministry held a two-day meeting with state education secretaries last week to discuss the legislation that will enable the government to fulfil its commitment to make free and compulsory education a fundamental right for all children between six and 14.

 Three years ago, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government had passed the 86th constitutional amendment bill in Parliament recognising that every child in the 6-14 age group has a right to free education. 

 But this can be translated into action only after the government passes the free and compulsory education bill. The legislation will work out the modalities.

 States, however, are dithering. The bill is not up to the mark. We need more discussions before it comes to Parliament, said a state official who had attended the meeting that ended on Friday.

 We need to make an in-depth study of the bill. Otherwise it may boomerang, said a state education secretary.

 There is also the worry about the cost it will entail. At present, the cost of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan ? a key project for universalising education ? is borne by the Centre and states at a 75:25 ratio. 

 The Centre plans to make it 50:50 from the 11th Plan which will come into effect from 2007. The Central Advisory Board of Education believes the cost of implementing the bill will range between Rs 54,000 crore and Rs 73,000 crore in addition to the current expenditure of Rs 47,000 crore on the Abhiyan. 

 The bill also lays down specifications for schools so that free education does not degenerate into poor quality education. It says there should be two teachers for a class of 60 students in the 1-5 age group and three teachers in a class of 90 students. 

 The human resource ministry wants to push through the bill as soon as possible since it believes the bill will give it the legal support necessary to send every child to school.

 The legislation takes special note of child workers. 

 Notwithstanding anything contained in the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, no person shall employ or engage a child in a manner which prevents her from attending a school, the bill says.

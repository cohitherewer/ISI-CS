 Calcutta film fest protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: A dozen documentary makers have withdrawn their films from the fourth International Conference of Communication Cinema, on in Calcutta till Wednesday, after they were asked to produce censorship certificates.

 The filmmakers, under the banner of Vikalp ? Films for Freedom, have been campaigning against arbitrary and capricious censorship of films by the Centre. 

 In the past year, the Vikalp package has been screened all over the country.

 The same group had walked out of the Mumbai international film festival and had organised their own screenings to protest against the authorities? insistence on producing of certificates from the censor board before showing their documentaries, although some of the short films had got the censor nod.

 Roopkala Kendra, which is organising the Calcutta festival, is an autonomous body attached to the information and cultural wing of the Bengal government. 

 Vikalp expressed shock at Roopkala Kendra?s insistence on certification. The filmmakers have been campaigning against the rule of producing censor certificates for films shown in festivals. 

 Till last year, the government did not usually make such a fuss. It was only last year, during the Mumbai festival, that the authorities refused to allow documentaries without certification to be screened. This was primarily to keep politically sensitive films, like those on the post-Godhra riots, from being aired. 

 However, the rule does not apply to foreign filmmakers.

 The films that Vikalp had brought to Calcutta included Amakaar directed by Surbhi Sharma, Bakkarwals by Rajesh Kaul, Paromita Vohra?s Unlimited Girls, Water Business is Good Business by Sanjay Barnela and Vasant Sabrewal, Sanjay Kak?s Words on Water and Harvest of Hunger by Rupashree Nanda.

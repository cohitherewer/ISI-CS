 Snowslips wreak havoc

 OUR BUREAU

 Jammu/Srinagar, Feb. 20: Avalanches and landslides took a heavy toll today, both in the Valley and in the Jammu region, adding to the horror of one of the worst winters in decades.

 More than 40 bodies were recovered this morning and almost double the number of people are missing in Jammu region alone, after a succession of landslides.

 Eighteen people were swept away in a landslide in Loren village of Poonch district this morning and about 22 this afternoon in Dunno village of the same district. Four deaths were reported from Murwah of Doda district.

 Massive avalanches in the Pir Panjal ranges killed 15 civilians, with 35 being feared trapped in the snow.

 Army rescue teams were rushed to the two foothill villages of Nagni and Waltango in the Pir Panjal mountains, after residents of the area braved the blizzard to inform the nearby army camp in the Valley of the avalanches at 6 pm, the defence public relations officer, Colonel Batra said. 

 The officer said massive avalanches had literally swept away the two villages around 12 noon. ?As soon as we got the information, army rescue teams along with some doctors and sniffer dogs left for the spot. It will take some time for the teams to launch a rescue operation as the area is avalanche prone and there is a lot of snow accumulated on the ground,? he said.

 In the Valley and in Jammu region, the Border Roads Organisation joined hands with the army to provide assistance and essential commodities to the people. However, the extreme weather conditions are hindering efforts to clear the path, making ground operations more difficult.

 The general officer commanding-in-chief, Northern Command, Lt. General Hari Prasad, said the army is providing shelter and food, but the residents must come forward to complement this effort.

 Kashmir, which has been without electricity for many days, is now temporarily without power as the divisional commander and the inspector-general of police, who head the local administration, are stranded in Jammu because of the heavy snowfall.

 Chopper stranded

 In Himachal Pradesh, 20 passengers and four crew members of the state?s only helicopter were stranded at Sissu (12,000 feet), 345 km from Shimla. About 80 passengers are stuck at different places at Keylong, 375 km from Shimla, because of continuous snow.

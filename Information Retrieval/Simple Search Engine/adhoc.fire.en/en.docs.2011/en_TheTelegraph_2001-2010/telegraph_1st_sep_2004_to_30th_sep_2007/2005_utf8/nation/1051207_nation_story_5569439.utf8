 New Delhi, Dec. 6: A four-member Enforcement Directorate team led by Sudhir Nath today left for Baghdad to scout for evidence in the Iraqi oil-for-food scam.

 Sources said Nath had decided to leave earlier than scheduled after outgoing ambassador to Croatia Anil Mathrani alleged in an interview that former foreign minister Natwar Singh had received oil vouchers from the Saddam Hussein regime.

 The team will also visit Jordan, Sweden and Luxembourg, the sources said.

 Directorate officials today questioned Mathrani and Andaleeb Sehgal, a close associate of Natwars son Jagat Singh, again. 

 According to the UN-appointed Paul Volcker committee, Andaleebs Hamadan Exports paid Rs 3.22 crore as illegal surcharge to the Saddam Hussein regime. The committee, which probed the oil-for-food scam, names Natwar as a non-contractual beneficiary.

 Sources said Mathrani and Andaleeb were made to sit facing each other on the same table and answer questions fired by a team of officials, including those from central intelligence agencies.

 There are rumours that Mathrani decided to spill the beans after he came to know that Andaleeb mentioned his name to Directorate officials during interrogation.

 Mathrani, who was whisked away from the airport on Sunday night, was grilled for six hours yesterday. He was at the office for more than five hours today.

 Andaleeb was today questioned for two-and-a-half hours. Earlier, he had been questioned for several days.

 The Directorate is investigating whether any illegal foreign currency transaction took place.

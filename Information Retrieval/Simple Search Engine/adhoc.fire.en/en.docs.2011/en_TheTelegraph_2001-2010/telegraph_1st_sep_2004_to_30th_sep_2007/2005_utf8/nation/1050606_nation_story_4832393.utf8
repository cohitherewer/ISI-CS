 Lahore lobby claws out for Aiyar house

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Lahore, June 5: What Neharwali Haveli in New Delhi is to President Pervez Musharraf, Laxmi Mansion in Lahore is to petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar.

 Named after the goddess of wealth, Laxmi Mansion, where Aiyar was born in 1941, retains its Hindu name in the heart of Islamic Pakistan to this day.

 The building also has a Calcutta connection. Ram Krishna Dalmia , who belonged to a business family from Calcutta, was selling insurance in Pakistan before Independence when he decided to finance the construction of Laxmi Mansion. 

 The apartment complex has shot into the news as the Lahore builders lobby, which wants to commercialise this quaint residential colony replete with ancient banyan trees and a park, has virtually laid siege. The colony is surrounded by posh shopping malls and the builders sense a killing.

 But the residents are putting up a spirited fight and Aiyar has jumped in to help them. The minister, accompanied by his wife, daughters and sister, took a trip down memory lane last evening in the colony where he had grown up as a little boy and his father had spent 20 years of his life.

 The residents have already met Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and want to convert the building into a heritage site. They point out that, apart from Aiyar, former Pakistan Prime Minister Meraj Khalid, former foreign minister Zafrullah Chaudhury and writer Saadat Hassan Manto had also lived in the apartments.

 Aiyar assured the residents that he would raise the matter with Pakistani authorities and would extend financial help to convert the apartments into a heritage site.

 The Indian petroleum minister also dug up a bit of its history and informed the residents that the red-brick apartments were modelled on St Johns Wood colony in London. Sujjan Singh Park in Delhi, where writer Khushwant Singh stays, is of similar design.

 Aiyar took time off his official schedule to spend more than an hour with the residents and then joined them for tea and kebabs.

 Some of the residents feel that if Delhi can think of making Neharwali Haveli a heritage site, Islamabad should accord the same status to Laxmi Mansion.

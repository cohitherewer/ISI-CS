 Young, female amp; Asian makes perfect GP

 - Profile 

 of UK family doc changes 

 Rupal Shah: Surprise winner

The traditional image of the British family doctor as a serious, besuited white middle-aged man is out of date. As far as patients are concerned, the perfect general practitioner is his polar opposite: young, female and Asian.

 A study of hundreds of patients, which asked them to rate doctors on a scale of one to five for perceived expertise, put women doctors ? both white and Asian ? first in almost all categories, while white, male doctors over the age of 50 languished near the bottom.

 Dr Rupal Shah, 31, fits the perfect GPs profile. Female doctors under the age of 35 were judged to have a preferable personal manner, superior technical skills and superior powers of description.

 Patients also stated that they felt more at ease with young, female doctors while giving physical examinations, were more likely to have faith in their diagnoses, and were more likely to follow their medical advice and prescribed treatment.

 In most of these categories, age and gender had a greater effect on scores than ethnic origin, but the young, female Asian doctor won marginally higher scores than her white female counterpart in every category.

 She scored particularly highly for the level of emotional support that she gave patients and the faith that people had in her diagnosis.

 The study involved 300 patients attending six general practices in south-west London, who were given photographs of doctors of varied age, sex and ethnic group.

 Patients were recruited from a range of ages and backgrounds. More women than men took part, although this is in keeping with mens less frequent attendance of GP surgeries. 

 Dr Reena Shah, 41, a London GP, who came up with the idea for the study, said that coming from a British-Indian background she had often wondered about peoples first impressions of their family doctors. 

 I didnt have any preconceived ideas, so I was surprised at how well the young female Asian GP did. It could be a halo effect: if somebody likes the look of one aspect of you, such as your looks, they will rate you highly across other areas too.

 The study, called Whats In a Face, and to be published in a scientific journal called Patient Evaluation and Control, gave white male doctors over the age of 50 an average score of 40 out of 60. Young, white female doctors got 44 while young, Asian female doctors received 47.

 Dr Rupal Shah, from Pimlico in London, was taken aback to learn that she fitted the perfect GPs profile. How strange! I had always imagined that an older white male had the most authority. Its very nice to hear, because I have sometimes felt that people look at me and think: Gosh, shes a bit young. Does she really know what shes talking about?

 She suggested that the younger GPs openness to new ideas had contributed to their higher popularity rating. My appointment times overrun a lot, because I like to discuss the various options available to patients. For the new generation of GPs, work is very much patient-centred. People often expect to be told what to do, especially older patients, but answers are rarely black and white.

 Dr Ramesh Mehta, the president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said the news did not surprise him. Naturally, everybody prefers good-looking, young women. Asian GPs are preferred because of their politeness. They seem to be a lot more caring. They are also extra-careful, probably, they are more anxious to ensure that there are no complaints because of communication gaps.

 Unsurprisingly, those at the bottom of the popularity table were less convinced. Dr Ian Greaves, 51, from Gnosall in Staffordshire, said: White male doctors over the age of 50 will always be here, so dont write us off. 

 My patients come and see me because they trust me and know I have a bit of experience.

 Ask a group of men with prostate cancer who they would rather see, and you might get a different view to that expressed in the survey.

 Dr John Canning, 50, from Middlesbrough, was more sanguine. Im disappointed my group is the least favourite, but Im not entirely surprised. We are seen as old and grumpy and less willing to comply with patients perceived wants.

 People are less likely to get a sick note from me, so perhaps Im not as user-friendly. Then again, thats what other patients like about me.

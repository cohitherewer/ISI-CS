 New Delhi, April 20: The government has decided to table the Phukan commission?s report on the Tehelka expos? in Parliament following a directive from Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and pressure from leaders of the Opposition National Democratic Alliance.

 But it is yet to take a view on the Central Vigilance Commission report on arms purchases for the 1999 Kargil war. Asked whether the government would table the report as demanded by the Opposition, parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said the Centre was yet to take a decision.

 In the Rajya Sabha, angry Opposition members stormed the well in protest against defence minister Pranab Mukherjee?s statement on Kargil purchases, forcing an adjournment.

 The minister had said the comptroller and auditor generals? report ?has brought out that the excuse of Kargil was cited to push through procurements that would otherwise have been scrutinised more closely?.

 Azad said the Phukan commission had submitted its report in three parts and the government had only the first part with it. The remaining two had been referred to the CBI. 

 ?As they (the Opposition) were eager and the Speaker also asked, we agreed to table the incomplete report, that is, part one,? said a senior cabinet minister.

 In the upper House, law minister H.R. Bhardwaj gave an assurance on tabling the report following a directive from chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat who quoted rules to say that any inquiry panel?s report would have to be tabled within six months of its submission.

 The report may be tabled towards the end of the session, which is scheduled to end on May 13, so that the government could stave off a discussion, sources said.

 Both Houses today saw heated exchanges between the treasury benches and the Opposition over tabling of the Phukan commission and CVC reports.

 The furore in the Lok Sabha started after George Fernandes said he was accused of ?being a thief? when, as defence minister in the NDA government, he had refused to hand over the CVC report to the public accounts committee of Parliament on ?grounds of national security?.

 ??Time and again when I said the report cannot be tabled, they continued their tirade. I know what is in the report and you (the government) also know that, then why not make it public?

 ?They are not concerned with national safety and security of the country,? Fernandes said, prompting slogans from the treasury benches. NDA members countered and the heated exchanges forced adjournment of the House for an hour.

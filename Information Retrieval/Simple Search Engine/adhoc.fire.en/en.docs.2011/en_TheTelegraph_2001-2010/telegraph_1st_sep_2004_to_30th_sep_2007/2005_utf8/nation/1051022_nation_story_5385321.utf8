 Congress has second thoughts on alliance

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: The Infosys chiefs outburst at H.D. Deve Gowda has shocked the Congress high command, for which the coalition with the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka is increasingly becoming an embarrassment.

 Congress leaders from the state have regularly been rushing to Sonia Gandhi with complaints about the high-handed methods of Gowdas party. They have been emboldened after Infosys boss N.R. Narayana Murthy angrily walked out of the Bangalore International Airport Ltd following Gowdas criticism that he had not done anything to promote the airport project.

 The Union minister of state for surface transport and MP from Kolar, K.H. Muniappa, and former state minister T.B. Jayachandra have met Sonia Gandhi and told her the alliance with the JD (S) was hurting not only the Congresss grassroots support base but also its pro-reform credentials. Sonia is understood to have told them she is already aware of it.

 Indications are that the Congress may rethink its ties with the JD (S) in the backdrop of the growing friction between the state government and the infotech industry, a situation that is becoming irksome to the Centre.

 Sources said such a rethink may happen once the local body polls in the state are through. The Congress had so far felt uneasy about fighting a fresh Assembly poll; but that situation may change after Gowdas open confrontation with infotech majors like Infosys.

 State Congress leaders are also unhappy with chief minister Dharam Singh, who, they feel, has been running the administration at Gowdas behest, ignoring his own partymens sensitivities and interests. 

 Last week, Singh handed over a district milk federation to Gowdas men though the Congress enjoys an 8:2 advantage in milk cooperatives.

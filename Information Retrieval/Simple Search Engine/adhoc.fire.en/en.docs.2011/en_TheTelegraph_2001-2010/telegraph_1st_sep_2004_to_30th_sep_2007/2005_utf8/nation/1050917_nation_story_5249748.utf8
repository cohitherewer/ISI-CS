 Voice test clears Salman

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Salman (top) and 

 Aishwarya: Relieved 

 Mumbai, Sept. 16: Its Salman Khans phone but not his voice.

 The man who abused and threatened a woman he addressed as Ash, boasted of his friendship with the underworlds whos who, and claimed he knew about the 1993 blasts beforehand still remains a mystery figure.

 The voice analysis report submitted by the Forensic Science Laboratory, Chandigarh, after a two-month investigation states that the voice samples of Salman and fellow actor Aishwarya Rai dont match those on the taped conversation, Mumbai police said today.

 The phone the call was made from has to be Salmans, though, if the state government is to be believed. Deputy chief minister R.R. Patil had told the Assembly the police had tapped the actors phone on the suspicion that he had links with gangster Abu Salem. The minister had identified the conversation.

 The forensic laboratory was given three samples: (a) the tape of the conversation played on television; (b) a purported copy of the tape produced by BJP leader Gopinath Munde; and (c) voice samples of Salman and Aishwarya, recorded by the police later, reading out portions of the transcript.

 The forensic report says (a) and (b) do match but (c) matches neither, thus virtually giving a clean chit to both actors.

 Additional commissioner K.L. Bishnoi appointed by the state government to probe the matter said they had received the forensic report the day before. It says the voice samples do not match.

 The police will incorporate the forensic report in the probe report and submit it to Patil.

 Salmans father and scriptwriter Salim Khan said his family was very happy with the findings.

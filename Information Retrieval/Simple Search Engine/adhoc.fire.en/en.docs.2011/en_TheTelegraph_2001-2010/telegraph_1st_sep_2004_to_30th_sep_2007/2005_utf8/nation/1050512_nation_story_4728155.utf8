 SC stokes death debate 

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, May 11: Right to life is what the Constitution guarantees every Indian. But right to die?

 The Supreme Court today rekindled the debate on euthanasia with notices to the Union government on a petition that has sought the right to refuse cruel and unwanted medical treatment for a terminally ill person.

 Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and P.P. Naolekar also issued notices to the health and law ministries to reply if the issue raised by Common Cause, a social activist group, had earlier been considered by them and if so, what was the stage of such consideration.

 The petition contended that when a medical expert opines that the person afflicted with terminal disease has reached a point of no return, then he should be given the right to die by removing the life support system to at least end his agonies before dying.

 Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, said those at the fag end of their natural life span and likely to go into a state of terminal illness or permanent vegetative state are deprived of their right to refuse cruel and unwanted medical treatment.

 Bhushan said patients are fed through hydration tubes, and kept on ventilator and other life-supporting machines to artificially prolong their natural life span and argued that those who preferred death to such torture should be given the right to die at least as a statutory right.

 The court said such a right in a country like India, which has a substantial illiterate population, could lead to misuse. Even in an advanced country like the US, right to die had evoked sharp debate, they said, alluding to the heart-wrenching case of Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged Florida woman who died recently, 13 days after her feeding tube was removed under a court order.

 Closer home, 25-year-old terminally ill patient K. Venkatesh had taken his death wish to Andhra Pradesh High Court in December. But his plea for mercy killing and his wish to donate his organs were turned down on the ground that there was no provision in law for allowing donation of organs in cases other than that of brain death.

 The apex court said conferment of the right to die and to what extent it should be given fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislature. 

 When Bhushan said a person whose life was ebbing out should be allowed to die as prolonging his life with support systems was an unnatural extension of the natural life span, the court pointed to mythology. Who can for sure say that a person afflicted with terminal disease could not be cured?

 The judges underlined the complexity of the issue with a poser. If the right to die is conferred on a person who has fallen unconscious due to the terminal disease and if he is rushed to hospital either by his father or son, should he and the hospital staff be termed as violators of the fundamental right conferred on the person?

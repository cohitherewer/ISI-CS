 Strip amp; assault charges on NRI

 Moga (PTI): A case has been registered against three people, including an NRI, on charges of severely beating, wrongly confining and video-graphing after stripping an employee of a scooter company.

 The FIR, lodged by Vinod Kumar, says the main accused Daljit Singh, an NRI, had a family dispute with his mother Balwinder Kaur. When he returned to the Punjab town from abroad, he did not find his mother and two sisters in the house.

 Suspecting Vinod to be providing them with shelter, Daljit, Narinder Singh Grewal and Kamlesh Kumar went to Vinods house at Ludhiana and threatened and thrashed him while trying to find out their whereabouts.

 They returned the next day and forced Vinod to Moga. He was confined in Daljits house where he was beaten, stripped and photographed, the FIR said.

 CBI rapped on age fudge

 New Delhi (PTI): The CBI was severely 

 criticised by a local court for its closure report filed 

 in the case of fudging of the date of birth certificate 

 by a senior IAS officer.

 The agency was investigating the case of Lalit Varma, an officer of the 1983 batch, who, after his entry into the civil services, claimed his date of birth to be February 13, 1962, instead of March 1, 1959.

 After the matter was reported to the department of personnel and training, it was sent to the CBI.

 The agency filed a closure report in January this year, after two years of investigation, saying there was not enough evidence to prosecute Varma.

 The closure report was rejected by the court, which asked the CBI to re-investigate the case and see evidence on record which included a report by central forensic sciences laboratory which said some numbers were overwritten.

 AIIMS death

 New Delhi (PTI): A doctor of the All 

 India Institute of Medical Sciences was found dead in his 

 hostel in south Delhi, police sources said on Sunday.

 Brijesh Kumar was a first-year student of master of surgery. No case has been registered, the sources said, adding that a post-mortem was being conducted.

 Sailor suicide

 Dubai (PTI): An Indian sailor hanged 

 himself in his docked vessel last week, a police officer 

 said. The Indian crew of the docked vessel alleged ill-treatment 

 by the Iranian captain and demanded justice for their dead 

 colleague, Gulf News said.

 Bachchan

 Mumbai (PTI): Actor Amitabh Bachchan, 

 recuperating in Lilavati hospital after an intestinal surgery, 

 is doing fine, hospital sources said. However, it has not 

 been decided when he would be discharged.

 The Rajasthan government will organise a Chambal 

 festival in February to project the brighter side of the 

 ravine and to change its traditional image as a den of dacoits.

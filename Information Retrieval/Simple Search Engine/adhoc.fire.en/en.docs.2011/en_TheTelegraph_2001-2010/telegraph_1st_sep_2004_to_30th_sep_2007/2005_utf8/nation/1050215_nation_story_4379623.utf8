 Eton digs up links with Raj, warts and all

 London, Feb. 14: It has educated no fewer than 18 Prime Ministers, 19 princes and kings, not to mention a Catholic saint.

 But now Eton College can boast another distinction that helped to spread its values across the world.

 New research reveals that 11 viceroys and five governors-general of India were Old Etonians, whose experiences on the school?s legendary playing fields played a key role in the way Britain ruled the ?jewel in the crown? of its empire.

 Andrew Robinson, an Eton history master, has been studying the school?s links with India. 

 He says that while there is much for the school to be proud of in the Raj?s 200-year history, he does not shy away from its less glorious moments.

 ?When we look at the Raj it would be wrong to hide the warts,? he said yesterday. 

 ?I remind the boys of a quotation at the Oxford Union in 1857 [the year of the Indian mutiny]: ?When every last rebel sepoy has been hanged, when every last rebel has been shot, then we may talk of mercy?

 ?There is also a diary entry from 1858 by a young man who had been at Eton, who wrote: ?What fun it is to shoot mutineers. It?s almost like shooting partridges.??

 Robinson, who is mounting a public exhibition at the school (from April 20 to September 30 in the Brewhouse Gallery, admission free) about its links with India, said that today?s Etonians were baffled by a statement by Lord Birkenhead, the secretary of state for India from 1924-28, that ?it is frankly ridiculous to consider the Indians governing their own country?.

 But he added: ?We look at the good intentions as well, the notion of district commissioners, governors who intended the best for the people they were ruling; the idea that they had a civilising mission.?

 George Curzon, viceroy from 1898 to 1905, was a brilliant student at Eton. As viceroy, Lord Curzon would hold June 4 dinners ? a traditional school function ? in Simla, the British summer capital. The one in 1901 had 14 Old Etonians. It does seem that he and others felt that they could trust the Eton network to run the sprawling sub-continent.

 Robinson has been gathering documents, photographs, memorabilia and film footage ? from old boys or their families, from the vast school collection and from museums and galleries ? to recall a remarkable roll call of Old Etonians over the centuries. Curzon?s pith helmet, lent by his family, is in the exhibition.

 There are artefacts relating to George Canning, the nineteenth century governor-general who was blamed for leniency, right up to Lord Linlithgow, a viceroy in the late 1930s.

 The exhibition features an interview with Gaj Singh II, Maharajah of Jodhpur, who attended the school in the 1960s. 

 There is a memorial at Eton to Princes Victor and Frederick, Maharajah Duleep Singhs two sons who were at Eton in the 1870s.

 There is memorabilia from Peter Lawrence, an Eton teacher who taught at The Doon School, one of the best known public schools in India in the 1930s and 1940s, when its first headmaster was A E Foot, also an Etonian.

 Even today, Etonians are encouraged to go to India ? but these days to teach during their gap years so as ?to put something back?.

 Mr Robinson himself has just left for India with two Eton boys on a visit to Mayo College, Ajmer, one of the schools with which Eton runs an exchange programme.

 Left sees reform prequel

 - Bardhan to assess impact 

of banking changes

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Left believes today?s announcement of banking reforms is a prelude to a more radical restructuring of the sector that could include foreign direct investment in private banks.

 ?They indicate the government is pursuing its policy of reforms in the banking sector,? said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan. Left parties are staunchly opposed to FDI in private banks on the grounds that it will lead to a takeover by foreign banks.

 For the time being, however, the Left says it is not ?opposed? to autonomy for public sector banks. The common minimum programme endorses the move, promising that ?public sector banks will be given full autonomy?.

 But the Left is wary of the ?sweeping reorganisation? announced today. ?We will have to study how it will impact this crucial financial sector,? said Bardhan. For instance, the Left is concerned about the effect of restructuring on the public sector banks? focus on lending as a priority sector. ?It has been declining over the years,? he said. The Left wants a strong lending sector.

 It is also not happy with the proposal to hire professionals from outside at higher salaries. ?We will have to see how it affects the banks? internal wage structure,? he said. 

 Left-supported banking federations earlier announced a day-long strike throughout the country next month to protest the banking reforms.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram is, however, determined to go ahead with his agenda. At a meeting with Bardhan, the minister made it clear he will not ?slow down? reforms because investors are ?waiting in the wings?.

 The Left is keenly awaiting the budget to see if the finance minister heeds its proposals. ?We will see how the budget turns out,? said Bardhan. The Left has recommended higher taxes for corporate groups and a Rs 50,000-crore allocation for the social sector.

 At Malappuram in Kerala, where the CPM held a state conference, politburo member Prakash Karat said his party would work towards a third front at the Centre. But he added this was not possible immediately, adds PTI. 

 ?Our party believes this country does not require a Congress-led or BJP-led government alone. Though there is no immediate possibility for a third alternative, our next party congress, scheduled to be held in New Delhi in April, will discuss it and work towards that,? he told a public meeting at the end of the four-day conference.

 For the time being, the Left?s strategy seems to be to ?bark? and ?bark? loudly every time the government proposes economic reforms that it is opposed to. But it may not ?bite? ? not just yet.

 BJP meeting

 At a meeting with the Prime Minister, top BJP leaders today raised doubts about the decision to allow travel on Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route without passports.

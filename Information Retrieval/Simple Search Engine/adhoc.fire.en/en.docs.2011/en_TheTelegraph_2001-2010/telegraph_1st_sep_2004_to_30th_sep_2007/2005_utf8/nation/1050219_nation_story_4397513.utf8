 Bail relief for Siwan sultan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 18: Patna High Court today granted regular bail to controversial Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Mohammad Shahabuddin in connection with the murder of CPI(ML) leader Munna Choudhury.

 A single-judge bench allowed Shahabuddin?s plea that the court should grant him bail as it had done in the case of the five other accused.

 The Siwan strongman was recently shifted to Beur Central Jail here following an Election Commission directive. 

 While the bail for Shahabuddin is good news for the RJD, the MP?s future continues to be uncertain. 

 The district administration of Siwan has sent a proposal to the home department for the detention of Shahabuddin under the Bihar Crime Control Act. 

 If the proposal is approved, then the strongman may well have to spend more time in jail.

 Imrana story on reel

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Imrana: Trauma on screen

 Lucknow, July 14: Fourteen days ago, when media cameras zoomed on her, Imrana had one desperate plea: she wanted to be left alone.

 But the lens is not ready to leave her.

 A director and his team have come out with a script for a film on the plight of the 25-year-old, who was allegedly raped by her father-in-law and then stopped by clerics from returning to her husband.

 Azgarh ? the Python, to be shot in ctober, will be based on Imranas life and the rule of panchayats in western Uttar Pradesh.

 Shaami M. Irfan, who has directed serials for national broadcaster Doordarshan and also worked with several Mumbai filmmakers, said news items he had been reading about the hapless mother of five made him think of a film.

 Last month, we sent a team of scriptwriters to Muzaffarnagar to study the social scenario, the idiom of the districts of western Uttar Pradesh and the social psychology of the people, Shaami said.

 The story will revolve around the life of women like Imrana who are caught between unkind, unfeeling male members in their families and oppressive caste panchayats.

 The movie, which will be shot in Allahabad and Varanasi and avoid locales in western Uttar Pradesh for the bad law and order situation in the rural areas, will be jointly produced by two Mumbai-based companies, Fun Lovers India and J.S. Patel Films.

 We are hoping to release the film by March 2006, added J.S. Patels Sawan Kumar.

 Although the cast, especially who would play Imrana, has not been decided yet, the screen father-in-law will be TV actor Raj Kumar Maurya. 

 We are approaching Tabu. If we get her dates, she will be our first choice, said a member of the production team.

 The film will be in the mould of a conventional masala film but based on authentic research, said a spokesman for the producers.

 The message we will send across is fundamentally human. It would show how in the name of the Shariat, women are exploited by a section of orthodox, unbending Muslim clerics, said the director.

 After she accused her father-in-law of raping her, the local panchayat had ordered her to leave her husband. Later, the Darul Uloom of Deoband issued a fatwa that directed her to remain separated from her husband as the rape had altered their relation.

 The decree sparked a furore across the country while the Darul Uloom was flooded with letters and emails, embarrassing the 149-year-old seminary that is used to unquestioning acceptance of its authority.

 While the controversy raged, a number of scriptwriters descended on Muzaffarnagar to get the real picture. We were the earliest to send a team, said a spokesman for J.S. Patel Films.

 Imrana is not the only woman who has inspired a film on her plight after a ruling by clerics. A film on Gudia ? the pregnant Meerut woman who was handed back to her long lost first husband who returned after a prisoner swap with Pakistan ? has already been shot. 

 Divya Dutt plays Gudia in the film Kahani Gudiya Ki while Rajpal Yadav is cast in the role of Arif, her first husband.

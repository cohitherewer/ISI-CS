 Family plans sati temple

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, May 28: The family of Ramkumari, who is said to have died on the pyre of husband Jageswar Tiwari in Banhudarhi on May 7, plan to build a sati temple on the site.

 The announcement came as police, based on statements from the Tiwaris gardener Gangacharan, filed an FIR today against unknown persons for allegedly abetting Ramkumaris act of sati and glorifying it.

 A member of the Tiwari family, Savitri, was quoted in local newspapers as saying the memorial to Ramkumari will soon be converted into a temple. We believe the death of Ramkumari was a case of sati, she said.

 We know about her statement and are keeping an eye out, said principal secretary, home, Aloke Sinha.

 The state government today rejected a police report that said Ramkumaris death was an act of suicide and not sati and asked that an FIR be filed.

 The governments case is bolstered by Savitris announcement as well as statements by the 52-year-old Gangacharan to a fact-finding team from an NGO, Varangana.

 The gardener said that when he reached the site of Jageswars cremation while searching for Ramkumari around 9 pm on May 7, I found a couple of persons near the pyre. When they saw me, they melted away in the darkness. Soon, the relatives found that her whole body was burnt except for the legs.

 The hint that some people had escorted Ramkumari to the pyre was taken up by Sinha, who said the police now suspect there was an element of coercion behind the sati.

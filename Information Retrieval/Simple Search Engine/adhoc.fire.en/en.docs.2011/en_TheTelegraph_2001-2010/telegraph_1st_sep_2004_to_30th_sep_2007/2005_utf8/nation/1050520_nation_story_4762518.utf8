 Magistrates in Delhi durbar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 19: The men who make the governments writ run across the vast stretches of the countryside today had their say before the highest seats of power.

 The United Progressive Alliance government, three days ahead of its first anniversary, kicked off a two-day interaction with district collectors (district magistrates) from across the country, taking a cue from what former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had done in 1987.

 Out from their districts and straight to the capital for brain-storming sessions with several Union ministers today and the Prime Minister tomorrow, the 350-odd officials couldnt have asked for a better opportunity to voice their frustrations and suggest cures.

 Though, according to the press release, the idea was to discuss how the delivery system at the district level can be improved, sources said a second reason was to get direct feedback about the administrative problems in non-Congress-ruled states.

 This is the best way to get feedback from the grassroots level, gauge the pulse of the people in respect of the state administration and develop a strategy for further action. That is why there are so many district collectors from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, a source said.

 Many collectors who attended the meeting were worried about their dwindling powers without any change in accountability.

 The Union government must explain why we alone should have to answer for the lapses, why not the elected representatives who direct us and press us to do things? a district collector from Bihar said.

 Most of the problems at the district level are an offshoot of this. Either the government should give us more powers or let us only be facilitators without any culpability.

 The officials also felt that those in Delhi have little idea of the problems in the districts and, therefore, this kind of interaction should be held more often.

 Some collectors from militancy-affected districts said that state governments and the Centre often fail to understand the issues and aspirations of the people.

 There have been instances when the state and the Union government chose to send in central forces to curb an unrest when releasing some funds would have been enough to resolve matters. The district collectors role needs to be redefined in such cases, said a collector from Bengal.

 The collectors had been told recently that amendments were being made to the CrPC Act and a separate directorate for prosecution being set up at the state level to ease their burden.

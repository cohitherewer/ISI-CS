 Goa Congress offensive 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 9: The Congress in Goa has launched a counter-offensive after winning the trust vote but losing the publicity battle to the BJP.

 It wants the Pratapsinh Rane government restored in the state that came under President?s rule on March 4. The party also wants early bypolls to fill the vacancies created after five BJP MLAs resigned and an Independent MLA was disqualified.

 All Congress MLAs, the five legislators who quit the BJP to throw their weight behind the rival party and disqualified Independent Filipe Neri Rodriguous arrived here today under Rane?s leadership. Having come with the party leadership?s approval, they met Sonia Gandhi in the morning and called on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in the evening.

 The Goa team submitted a memorandum and relevant documents to Kalam to press its case for ending President?s rule and reinstating the Congress-led government.

 ?The President has assured the delegation that he would examine the papers submitted to him and do the needful,? said Margaret Alva, AICC general secretary in charge of Goa.

 The state Congress leaders, particularly the legislators, have been angry that the Centre led by their party brought Goa under President?s rule even though the Rane regime had won the confidence vote. They have even pointed an accusing finger at the Union home minister. Asked how the party could allow its MLAs to criticise Shivraj Patil, Alva said: ?That is why we asked them to come here and present their case before the party leadership, the President and the Prime Minister.?

 The delegation, Alva said, is likely to meet Manmohan Singh.

 BJP lets out Pokhran open secret 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: The BJP revealed that the preparations for the Pokhran nuclear tests, which were conducted in 1998, had started in 1996 itself when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister for 13 days.

 Former foreign and finance minister Jaswant Singh confirmed the open secret in a symposium organised by the BJP to mark the seventh anniversary of Pokhran tests. 

 Back in 1996, the Vajpayee government had set in motion the whole process that culminated in the nuclear blasts two years later. Though we were in office for a short time only, in 1996 itself, we had set in motion a whole process to ensure that what has all along been a hidden programme could become an explicit and direct programme, stated Singh.

 BJP sources had spoken of how Vajpayee, who was invited by then President Shankar Dayal Sharma by virtue of the BJP being the single largest party to form a government and prove his majority within two weeks, was keen to detonate the N-bomb but was restrained by the defence establishment till the vote of confidence, which he did not win. 

 In 1998, when he got the numbers, the Pokhran blast was the first major act of Vajpayee.

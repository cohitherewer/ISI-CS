 Buta vows crime fight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ashok Yadav

 Patna, July 26: As police remained clueless in the murder of Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Ashok Yadav in a bomb blast yesterday, the state administration led by governor Buta Singh today vowed to deal sternly with criminals.

 The Centre is understood to have sought a report from the governor on the law and order situation after the crime graph in the city saw a sudden rise over the past few days.

 Our first priority is to improve the law and order situation. Our efforts have borne fruit. In the recent past, several notorious criminals have been caught or killed. Criminals are now bringing about a change in their modus operandi but the police are determined to go after them, Singh said. 

 Bihar director-general of police Ashish Ranjan Sinha, meanwhile, conducted a meeting with senior police officials of the district and issued instructions to solve the Yadav murder case at the earliest, besides asking them to upgrade the security system in the city.

 An IPS officer posted in the city said the murder appeared to be a clear-cut case of the RJDs intra-party squabbles. 

 Our investigations so far indicate that the four persons who came to the Patna Water Board office yesterday were hired criminals acting on behalf of some big political names. We are certain to gather more clues in the case very soon, the official said, adding that no arrest has been made.

 Late last evening, Yadavs brothers lodged an FIR with the Kotwali police station in which they named Patna mayor Krishna Murari Yadav as the main conspirator in eliminating the young RJD leader. 

 Yadavs son-in-law Sanjeev Kumar, who also happens to be the zilla parishad chairman, and water board chief engineer Ravindra Kumar have also been named along with four unidentified persons.

 Meanwhile, a high-level nine-member team of Election Commission, led by panels observer K.J. Rao, today began its review of the preparedness for the coming Assembly polls, asserting that presenting voter identity card would be mandatory for people exercising their franchise this time.

 The delegation, Rao said, would be split in five teams, each undertaking a review tour of the different divisions. To begin with, we will be on the job till July 31, Rao said.

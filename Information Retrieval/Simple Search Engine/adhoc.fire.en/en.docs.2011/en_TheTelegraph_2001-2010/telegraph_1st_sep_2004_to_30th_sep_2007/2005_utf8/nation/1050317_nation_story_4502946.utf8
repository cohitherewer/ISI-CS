 Pakistan reaffirms ceasefire 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 16: Pakistan has reaffirmed its commitment to maintain the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Kashmir after India pointed out four instances of firing in nearly 16 months.

 Pakistan?s director-general of military operations has denied that Pakistani troops were involved in opening fire, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a written reply in Parliament today.

 Despite the firing, no casualty or loss has been reported. 

 The incidents of firing since November 2003, when the two armies agreed to cease fire, were reported twice from the Rajouri sector and once each in the Palanwala and Poonch sectors.

 In reply to another question, Mukherjee said India and Pakistan discussed the Siachen issue in August 2004 but no decision was taken on withdrawal of troops. 

 New Delhi?s decision in November last year to reduce troops in Jammu and Kashmir was ?unilateral? and was based on an assessment of the situation. 

 It was concluded that the situation had improved because of the ?relentless efforts on the part of the security forces to contain terrorism.?

 Mukherjee said the reduction or readjustment of troops was under ?constant review?.

 The defence minister said 537 militants were killed and 159 casualties were reported by security forces between July 2004 and January 2005.

 I acted in self-defence: Uma

 Uma Bharti: Another letter

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: Uma Bharti has spoilt the BJPs party over Natwar Singhs resignation from the cabinet.

 While the party was busy exhibiting Natwar as its prize trophy after a month-long campaign on the Volcker report, Uma butted in with yet another letter. 

 Addressed to BJP disciplinary committee chairman Ram Naik, Umas letter appealed against the parliamentary boards decision to expel her indefinitely, in her characteristic melodramatic style. Indian law forgives an attack if it is done in self-defence. I am appealing to the disciplinary committee to apply the laws of natural justice, she wrote.

 While the letter was still on its way, Uma loyalists alleged that Madhya Pradesh BJP organising secretary Kaptan Singh Solanki had compared the former chief minister to gangster Abu Salems companion Monica Bedi, who is now in jail.

 Didis supporters were telling Solanki that her rallies are attracting a lot of response. Thousands of people are flocking to see her. Solanki dismissed it saying even Monica Bedi is drawing huge crowds, charged an Uma loyalist. 

 Solanki is one of the most powerful RSS leaders in Madhya Pradesh. 

 In fact, contrary to Umas claims, the RSS gives full credit to Solanki for the BJPs two-third majority in the last Assembly elections. The Sangh believes it was the organisation under Solanki that was responsible for the BJPs landslide victory.

 Madhya Pradesh has a very strong organisational structure. That was what gave the BJP a two-thirds majority in the last Assembly elections, Sangh sources said. 

 RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav was not available for comment but sources said the Sangh would not like to react to such frivolous allegations. Woh jane aur jinhone kaha woh jane (Let Uma and whoever has made these statements settle it among themselves), said Sangh sources.

 The BJP has dismissed Umas appeal against her expulsion. The parliamentary board is the highest decision-making body in the party. Once the board has taken a decision, appeals to other committees have no relevance, said Naik.

 Party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar refused to react to Umas statements against Solanki. I dont think I will dignify that with a response.

 Paswan for Prez rule in ?hung? Bihar 

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Feb. 16: Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan says Laloo Prasad Yadav has a secret pact with the ?fascist? NDA. The Rashtriya Janata Dal president stresses Paswan is hand-in-glove with the ?communal? BJP. The NDA believes the two and the Congress are hatching a conspiracy to ensure that Bihar remains in a ?mess?.

 Laloo Prasad tirelessly asserts that his party will form the next government on its own. Paswan says the LJP will be in a position to rule Bihar with the Congress? support. The NDA swears it is inching towards the majority mark and will not need anyone?s support to see Nitish Kumar as the next chief minister.

 The exit polls for the two rounds and the projections for the final results suggest that no party or group is likely to rule Bihar on its own strength. The confusion over the outcome of the elections ? and the projected ?inevitability? of a hung House ? has only made matters worse.

 By now, Laloo Prasad is furious, Paswan will prefer President?s rule if no one gets a clear majority and a cautious NDA is slowly going soft on its attack on the LJP chief. The Congress, expectedly, is not placing bets on the post-election scene and would rather wait for the final numbers.

 ?Bihar should be put under central rule for two years to cleanse it of the filth that has gathered in the past 15 years. Congress president Sonia Gandhi will not press us to join a government of which the RJD is a part. There is obviously no question of our aligning with the NDA,? Paswan said today. 

 But Laloo Prasad is more acerbic. ?Sab bakwaas hain. In logon ka dimag khisak gaya hain. (It is all nonsense. These people have lost their mind). It is a conspiracy,? he said when asked to react to the exit polls, which showed that the RJD is nowhere near getting a majority on its own. The RJD chief has been calling the LJP a ?mobile party? which, he claims, will be decimated after the elections.

 The BJP?s spin-doctor for Bihar, Arun Jaitley, subscribes to the projections only to the extent that these indicate a ?rising graph? for the NDA. ?The trend can only get stronger and the final figures will be in our favour. There is a groundswell against the RJD. People know that the Congress and the LJP are on its side. Paswan is speaking out of desperation,? he explained.

 Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar is not clear about the results but he is certain that the RJD is on its way out. ?The people are well aware of the games of the UPA partners. Bihar needs a change and that is the only way this state can become normal,? he said.

 The number of ?intangibles? seems to be mounting by the hour in these elections. ?Are Muslim voters divided? Are the rural upper castes inclined towards the LJP in pockets? Is the anti-incumbency factor for real? Do voters want development? There are no easy answers to these questions,? said a senior sociologist here. 

 ?The results cannot be easily predicted. This is the big change this time,? he added.

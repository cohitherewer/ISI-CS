 Mumbai, May 9: Two constables in an inebriated state were arrested by the Thane railway police on charges of molesting a 42-year-old married woman late last night even as Mumbai police battle a severe image crisis.

 Police sources said the incident happened around 10.15 pm when the woman, a resident of Kalwa, a suburb adjoining Thane city, alighted from the train on platform number 2 on Thane railway station with her husband and a teenage daughter.

 When they were walking towards the entrance of the railway station, two drunk constables collided with the woman and touched her in an indecent manner. According to the womans complaint, when she protested their behaviour, the constables threatened her with dire consequences.

 The heated argument between the woman and the constables alerted commuters on the railway platform. Angry over the constables behaviour, the commuters thrashed them and handed them over to the police.

 The constables, identified as Sunil Dhanaji Sawant and Subhash More, work with the police training school at Marol. They were arrested under sections 354, 506, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code on charges of outraging the modesty of a woman and molestation. The constables were produced before the Kalyan railway police court and remanded in judicial custody.

 The incident comes a few days after a police constable was suspended on similar charges of molesting two lady commuters at a railway station last week. The constable, who tried to stop a fight between two women, was accused by them of indecent behaviour.

 Mumbai witnessed a public outrage over the rape of a 17-year-old by a drunk police constable inside a police outpost on Marine Drive on April 21. The constable, Sunil More, was arrested on charges of rape and was summarily dismissed by the police commissioner using Article 311 of the Constitution. 

 Womens organisations took to the streets over the incident demanding setting up of a special court to try the rape case and ensure severe punishment for the offence.

 Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy had said that alcoholism on duty was not a major problem plaguing the force but had promised that his department would take stringent action against those found drinking while on duty.. 

 He had suspended eight other constables from different police stations after they were found consuming alcohol on duty.

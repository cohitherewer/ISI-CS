 IMA meet in missing doctor case

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, Jan. 5: With abducted doctor U.K. Raja still missing, the Bihar unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow to decide its course of action. 

 Raja, an orthopaedic surgeon at Purnea Subdivisonal Hospital, was abducted on January 1 while he was on his way to Purnea from Madhepura. 

 Purnea police today claimed that the Pintu Yadav gang could be responsible for the abduction and raids were on to arrest the criminals.

 Meanwhile, members of the Madhepura, Purnea, Saharsa, Supaul and Kagaria branches of the IMA have stayed away from work for two days. 

 Purnea doctors today held demonstrations before the subdivisional hospital and demanded Raja?s rescue by this evening, failing which they would go on an indefinite strike from tomorrow. 

 In Darbhanga, there were protests against the murder of executive engineer Aditya Kumar Thakur. State engineers staged a dharna before the district magistrate?s office in the town. 

 Reports from Purnea said a group of striking non-gazetted government employees today clashed with their counterparts on duty at the district headquarters.

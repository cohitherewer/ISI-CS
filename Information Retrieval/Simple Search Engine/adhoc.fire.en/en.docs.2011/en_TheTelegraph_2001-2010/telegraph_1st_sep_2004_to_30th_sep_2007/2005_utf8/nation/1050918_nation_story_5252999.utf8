 Teachers, students welcome change

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: IIT coaching institutes, it seems, are fast getting isolated.

 Many of the students who enrolled in these centres for a seat in the premier technological institutes and teachers have welcomed the proposed changes in the IIT admission process.

 These changes are long overdue. The earlier admission rules were fine for 20 years back. The number of aspirants has increased exponentially and a cap on the number of times a candidate can appear is essential today, said a senior member of the physics department of IIT Delhi.

 Several students said those who have twice failed to clear the entrance were obviously not fit for IITs.

 Two turns are enough for a person good enough to get through, said Sanyog Yadav, a final year electrical engineering student of IIT Delhi who made it on the second attempt.

 Also, it isnt fair that students who have studied for, say, three years elsewhere compete with those who have just cleared Class XII.

 The coaching centres say the new proposals were not thought out properly, but senior teachers clarified that the changes did not come about suddenly. A committee set up over five years ago recommended these changes, said Dr G. Vijayaprakash, who teaches semiconductor physics to BTech students in IIT Delhi.

 Although many students have welcomed the reforms, they say certain precautions need to be taken when the new rules come into force.

 It is harder to score in state board exams compared to the CBSE. There should be some means to normalise the board marks to the equivalent of 60 per cent in CBSE, said Neha, a student.

 Some students also say aspirants should be given the freedom to choose when they want to make their second try.

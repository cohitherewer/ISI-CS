 Aged couple killed in Delhi

 New Delhi: The capital got a grim reminder of how unsafe its elderly are with the gruesome murder of a couple in an affluent south Delhi colony on Saturday, reports our special correspondent.

 Seventy-one-year-old S.D. Khosla, a former executive director of the Industrial Development Bank of India, and wife Santosh, 69, were attacked with a butchers knife and thick iron rods at their greater Kailash home around 4 pm.

 Shocked eyewitnesses saw a profusely bleeding Khosla run gasping out of the house, R227, and stagger into an adjacent toy shop, which immediately called police. By the time the officers arrived, the attackers had fled.

 The couple were immediately rushed to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) where Santosh ? who turned out to be an aunt of leading heart surgeon Naresh Trehan ? was declared dead on arrival. Her husband was admitted to the intensive care unit where he, too, died of his injuries.

 After retirement from the bank, Khosla had been working as senior consultant with Hero Honda Motors of the Munjal Group. The couple are survived by a London-based son and a daughter who lives in the nearby Alaknanda Colony.

 A servant who stayed with the couple had left two days ago and efforts were on to trace him, the police said.

 A senior officer said the attackers probably numbered four to five. The police are unsure of the motive but are examining a possible property angle.

 Delhi police, who have a cell for senior citizens headed by an additional commissioner, say many aged couples living by themselves in posh and semi-posh colonies are being pressured by land sharks to sell off their property at throwaway prices.

 Officers said they had picked up important leads after forensic examination of the scene of crime and hoped to crack the case soon.

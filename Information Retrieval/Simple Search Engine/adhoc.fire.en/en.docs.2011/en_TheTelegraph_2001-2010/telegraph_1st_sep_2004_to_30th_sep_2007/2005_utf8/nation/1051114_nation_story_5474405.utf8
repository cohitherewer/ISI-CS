 Maoist raid on Bihar town

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 13: Hundreds of Naxalites stormed Jehanabad town, 50 km from the Bihar capital, late tonight and exploded bombs in an area where police lines and a sub-jail are located.

 There was no official confirmation if anyone died in the attack but a source in Jehanabad said suspected CPI (Maoist) extremists were targeting the police.

 Security reinforcements have been rushed from Patna and Gaya and top officials were holding a meeting in Patna late into the night.

 The attack began around 9 pm. The extremists announced on loudspeakers that people should remain indoors. They said they had no enmity with the common people and the police were their sole target, the source said.

 Jehanabad district magistrate Rana Awadhesh told a television channel around 10.45 pm that the attack had been repulsed. But another source in Jehanabad said the administrations claim did not appear to be true.

 The source said the objective of the rebels attack appeared to be three ? to loot arms and ammunition from the police lines armoury, free their comrades lodged in the jail and send a signal to the authorities that they were still capable of carrying out big raids.

 A few months ago, the extremists had targeted a police station in the Madhuban area of East Champaran, close to the Nepal border. 

 A senior police officer said he had not heard of Naxalites attacking a town.

 This is a new phenomenon. Perhaps they wanted to send a bigger message by sticking to their classical theory of attacking a city after increasing their influence in the countryside. The administration has been caught off guard, he added.

 Unconfirmed reports said the rebels fired several rounds, blew up a part of the jail and managed to free at least two of their comrades from the prison.

 The attack comes two days after a similar raid in Giridih district of Jharkhand where Maoists stormed a home guard training centre and looted arms and ammunition. 

 Eight home guard cadets died in the attack on the training centre, which is located 3 km from the district headquarters.

 Despite the customary boycott calls given by the extremists, elections in Jehanabad and other Naxalite hotbeds passed off peacefully. Heavy deployment of paramilitary forces had averted any pre- or post-poll attack in central-south Bihar.

 Kashmir puts ?Id? welcome on hold

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Uri (Jammu and Kashmir), Feb. 17: The day after the jubilation in the Valley over the imminent opening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service, people in this last major town on India?s side of the Line of Control are cautious.

 ?I will only believe it once the bus is moving on the road,? said Abdul Aziz, a 41-year-old state government employee in this north Kashmir town, 100 km from Srinagar, for whom the news is too good to be true.

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and his Pakistani counterpart, Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, had yesterday announced the April 7 opening of the road that has been in disuse for over 50 years.

 ?The real emotional integration would be if we were allowed to move by the bus (starting) from Uri town to Muzaffarabad,? said Aziz, most of whose relatives still live on the other side. The scheduled service will pass through Uri.

 The residents here are keeping their emotions in check so that they don?t run the risk of being disappointed.

 ?It would be the realisation of a lifetime?s dream. Most of my family, including my brother, live across the LoC,? said 70-year-old Ali Mohammad Mirchal. ?But it is not only about my family,? he said. ?Thousands of Kashmiris would welcome that day as they welcome Id. I only hope the news is for real this time. We have been hearing about the road-opening for so many years.?

 At 91, Haji Akhbar of Gharkote village in Uri would prefer to take the announcement at face value. ?When you say it is happening, it must be true,? said the man who has a simple wish.

 ?I have lived all these years hoping to go to the other side of the border to meet my son. Before I die, I want to see him. If travel is allowed on an entry permit, I will be the first to board the bus,? he said.

 Like most others, Ghulam Rasool, 60, is wary but he cannot resist the optimism. ?I am not sure how much progress has been made on road-opening but this time everyone seems very optimistic.?

 ?I am looking forward to the day when I can board the bus from Lal Chowk and drive to my brother?s hometown,? said Rasool, who last met his brother over 40 years ago.

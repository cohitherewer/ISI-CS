 Rape in temple complex

 Jodhpur, Oct. 2 (PTI): A Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four men yesterday inside a temple complex here, a police official said today. 

 However, the priest, Hari Lal, said the incident did not take place inside the temple premises as the shrine was closed in the afternoon.

 One of the four accused, Ramesh Meghwal, allegedly lured the victim ? who belongs to the Bheel community ? to the deserted Rajasthan government-run Ranchordas temple complex. 

 The woman, a resident of Bansi on the outskirts of the city, was living alone for the past two years as she was separated from her husband, according to the deputy superintendent of police Rajendra Singh Sisodia.

 Meghwal has not yet been caught. However, two of the people named in the complaint lodged with police were arrested and questioned, the police official said. Both are residents of Ghoron-ka-chowk near the temple complex.

 The woman was sent for a medical test and given police security at the Sardarpura police station, Sisodia said.

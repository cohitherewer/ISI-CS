 Andhra scare 

 Hyderabad, Jan. 8: Srikakulam is suffering from the ripple effects of the wall of water that washed out the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, reports our special correspondent.

 The passenger ship, MV Akbar, brought back 2,000 people of Andhra Pradesh, stranded on the islands, on Wednesday. But 1,500 are still missing, mostly from the remote district of Srikakulam. 

 Concerned, the state government sent a team of ministers to the islands for a two-day stock-taking. The team, led by revenue minister D. Prasada Rao and home minister K. Janareddy, returned yesterday.

 ?It is total chaos on the islands and it is very difficult to make any assessment right now,? said Rao. 

 So far, around 12,000 survivors from the state have returned to Visakhapatnam or Chennai. 

 ?We are providing them tickets for return journeys. If they want to come later, we will provide them an open ticket also,? said chief port administrator of the Andamans Dhileswar Rao. According to information available with him, only 56 people from Andhra were either missing or dead. 

 The island authorities, however, added that they had no records to give the correct picture.

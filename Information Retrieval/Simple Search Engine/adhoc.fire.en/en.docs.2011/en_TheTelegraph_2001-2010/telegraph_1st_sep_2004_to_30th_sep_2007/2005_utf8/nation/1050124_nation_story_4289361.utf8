 Kendrapara, Jan. 23: Seven-year-old Rashmita Kayal was not aware of the existence of a country called Bangladesh till she overheard snatches of a conversation between her mother Bishnupriya and father Binayak, a shopkeeper in Ramnagar village of Mahakalpada block.

 On, January 16, however, the Class I student of Ramnagar Upper Primary School had a better idea of the neighbouring country after local police officials served the ?Quit India? notice on the entire family as part of the Orissa government?s ongoing deportation drive.

 Pointing at her two children, Rashmita and Debashish, Bishnupriya asks: ?They are yet to comprehend it fully. But doesn?t it sound absurd?? 

 ?They were born in this country,? she adds.

 While adults in Mahakalpada spend sleepless nights over the notice, more than 300 children face an uncertain future for no fault of theirs. 

 A week ago, students of Hariabanka ME School in Kharinasi village were adding up figures in the classrooms. Now, they are counting how many of their classmates would have to leave for Bangladesh.

 Kavita Sarkar, a Class V student of the school, is scared to talk about the notice she received from the local police inspector on January 16. ?Bhoy korar ki achhe? Bol (What is there to fear? Speak up),? her mother comforts Kavita while asking her to recount the notice. 

 Similarly, Harekrushna Mandal, Supriya Mirdha, Dipankar Sarkar, Ranjan Sarkar and several other students of the school are aware of the fact that their lives are about to change.

 The same story is repeated in Bahakuda, Pitapata, Baraja-Bahakuda and Jamboo. While teachers try to comfort the children, some of them have become facilitators for the administration in the deportation process. 

 Last Monday, Ishwar Chandra Mallick, the headmaster of Hariabanka ME School, was asked to stop classes as the police had to serve the notice on 30 students of the institution.

 The official team, unable to locate the elders in the village, decided to visit the school to hand over copies of the notice. The ?shortlisted? children were asked to come out of the classrooms and receive the notice. ?You are Bangladeshis and have to leave for that country,? a gun-wielding police constable told them bluntly. Stunned, Harekrushna asked, ?Why should we go there?? The officials had no answer to this simple question.

 Former Ramnagar sarpanch Bijoy Shukla, who witnessed the scene, says: ?It was really cruel and inhuman.? 

 ?Soon after the students received the deportation notice, they started crying. I had to suspend classes for the day,? Mallik says. The attendance has subsequently gone down. 

 Justifying the decision to include children born in India on the deportation list, state law minister Biswabhusan Harichandan says: ?If the citizenship status of their parents is illegal, then theirs too is illegal.? 

 Yesterday, about 300 students sent postcards and letters to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam urging him to intervene and prevent their deportation. ?The government wants to send us to Bangladesh. But we are Indians. We know that you love children. Save us from dying in Bangladesh,? they wrote. 

 On the other hand, their elders have petitioned Congress chief Sonia Gandhi seeking her intervention. The district administration has slapped the notice on 1,544 settlers so far. Seven people are reportedly missing.

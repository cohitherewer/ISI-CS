 Calcutta chapter in freedom history

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, June 23: In a season when history is being frequently looked at in new light, most historians feel the governments recognition of the Komagata Maru incident and the Kuka movement as part of the freedom struggle is a case of better late than never.

 In 1914, the Komagata Maru, a ship carrying Indian workers, was fired at by British forces as it was docking at Calcutta. The workers, who had gone to Canada in search of employment, were coming back after interacting with patriotic Indians there. The British fired in the belief that the workers had been involved in anti-British propaganda.

 Almost 90 years later, the Indian government has conceded that the event and its repercussions, along with the Punjab-based Kuka movement, were part of the struggle against the British.

 The Kuka movement, though limited to Punjab, was staunchly anti-British and historians believe it is entitled to an important place in the annals of the freedom struggle. They are of the opinion that while considering the freedom struggle, all movements that led to the build-up of anti-British sentiment must be included.

 Professor J.S. Grewal, chairman of the prestigious Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla, expressed disappointment at the governments delay in recognising these events. 

 It is unfortunate that in our country, politicians and others have to raise a historical issue for it to be recognised by the government as being an important part of our history. If one looks at the freedom movement as an anti-British struggle, there is little doubt that both the Kuka movement and the Komagata Maru event played a role in galvanising many Indians, he said.

 The Komagata Maru incident was an important eye-opener for the Indian people as to how far the British suppression against Indians could go. It became a symbol of Indian resistance to the colonial authorities. It also contributed to the Gadar movement, said Professor Indu Banga, who has done extensive research on the firing.

 The Komagata Maru event must be recognised for its role in bringing to the mainstream expatriate Indians who wanted to fight for their countrys independence, Banga added.

 Professor Dilip Simeon, of Delhi University, said the Indian National Congress, right from the late 19th century, was concerned about the plight of Indians working in Fiji. 

 The firing on the ship strengthened the resolve of the freedom movement to include the concerns of expatriate Indians. The Kuka movement, too, had links with the Congress, he added.

 Comparing the brutality of the firing on the Komagata Maru to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, eminent historian Professor Arjun Dev said: These were all mass uprisings against the British administration. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the Komagata Maru event were all responsible for thousands of Indians subsequently joining the freedom struggle.

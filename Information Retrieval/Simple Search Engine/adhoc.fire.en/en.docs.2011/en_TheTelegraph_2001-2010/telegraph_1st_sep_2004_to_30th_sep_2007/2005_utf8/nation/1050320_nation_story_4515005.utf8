 Ghee seizure

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 19: The Food and Drug Administration in Maharashtra today seized approximately 400 tonnes of adulterated vanaspati ghee worth Rs 9 crore from two godowns in Thane district.

 The FDA?s vigilance team seized the stocks in the evening from the godowns belonging to Sri Lanka-based Reliance Export Company and Indian firm Gujarat Ambuja Exports at Bhiwandi. 

 The Sri Lankan company exports the ghee and the Indian firm distributes it. 

 The seizures were conducted after testing samples of the ghee, which showed that instead of sesame oil, a prominent component of vanaspati ghee, these stocks used palm oil, FDA spokesperson Prakash Uttarwar said. 

 ?Our tests also showed that the melting point of the ghee was much higher than what it should be. We also suspect that these firms tried to hoodwink the customs,? said FDA commissioner A. Ramakrishnan.

 The raids come two days after the FDA launched a campaign against leading baby products manufacturers like Johnson amp; Johnson India, Wipro and Himani, questioning their regulatory clearances.

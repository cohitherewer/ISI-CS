 Temple coin scam busted

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, April 26: Andhra Pradesh police yesterday busted a coin collection scam at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam through which lakhs of rupees were siphoned off from the public donations made by devotees at the Lord Venkateshwara temple.

 A contractor hired by the Indian Overseas Bank for the disposal of coin bags from the devasthanam is said to have connived with temple employees engaged in counting the money. 

 R. Ravishankar Reddy, the police inspector of Tirupati probing the case, said the temple employees put two-rupee coins in a bag meant for one-rupee coins and ?created a coded identification mark?. 

 This bag, along with others, was sent to the IOB, which in turn handed them over to the contractor. He then changed the coins, filling the bag with one-rupee coins, making ?a neat pie? in the process. The contractor then handed the bags to sub-contractors. 

 The scam came to light when one of the sub-contractors spilled the beans. 

 Everyday, coins worth Rs 5 lakh are collected and some 50,000 devotees visit the Tirumala temple. 

 The temple board yesterday said devotees who came with recommendation letters for last-minute seva and darshan will have to pay the double the normal fare. 

 A temple spokesperson said: ?We earmark around 2,000 special seva tickets for VVIPs who come with recommendation letters or through influential persons. They enjoy all the privileges for the nominal amount charged for all devotees. Under the new scheme such persons will contribute almost Rs 10 lakh additionally to the TTD.?

 The temple will also offer free lunch or dinner for all ticket-holding devotees.

 Dam quake rattles Mumbai

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, March 14: Moderate tremors measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale today rocked Mumbai, Pune, Satara and parts of the western Maharashtra, causing panic.

 The epicentre of the quake was in the Koyna Dam region in Satara in western Maharashtra, a known zone for seismic activity, over 240 km from Mumbai.

 The impact of the tremors was also felt in Panaji and Vasco da Gama in Goa, and Hubli, Belgaum, Dharvad and Bangalore in Karnataka, reports said.

 However, the tremors, recorded at 3.13 pm, did not cause any damage to life or property in any of the three states.

 According to the regional weather bureau director, C.V. Veerabhadran, the quake?s epicentre was recorded at 17.2 degrees north and 73.7 degrees east in the Koyna region. He said 5.1 on the Richter scale is considered ?a moderate quake, and is not believed to cause any extensive damage?.

 The Satara district collector, Subbarao Patil, told The Telegraph: ?It certainly has caused panic, but there have been no reports of any damage anywhere in the region. The dam is safe. An expert team of engineers has left for Koyna Dam to inspect if there is any cause for worry.?

 Koyna Dam has been experiencing tremors of mild to moderate intensity every year, causing worry to the state administration about the dam?s safety. ?Experts have told us that only a quake of more than 8 on the Richter scale could cause serious damage to the dam. But, as a precaution, we monitor the dam site regularly,? Patil said.

 The Koyna Dam region experienced the last major earthquake on December 11, 1967, which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale.

 In Mumbai and Pune, the tremors caused panic, especially in multi-storeyed office buildings. The tremors rattled office furniture and glass windows, but no visible damage was reported. People working in some highrises in Nariman Point rushed out in temporary panic, but soon resumed work. 

 The fire authorities as well as the disaster management cell set up by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said they have received no reports of any damage.

 The Andaman and Nicobar Islands continued to experience tremors in the aftermath of the December 26 tsunami. This morning, a quake measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale jolted the Great Nicobar island.

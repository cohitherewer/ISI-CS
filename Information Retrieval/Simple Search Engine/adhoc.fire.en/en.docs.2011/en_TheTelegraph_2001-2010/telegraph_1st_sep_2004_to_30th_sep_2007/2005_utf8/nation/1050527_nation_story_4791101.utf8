 Tax sop for sporting events

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 26: The government today decided to amend the income-tax act to exempt the earnings of Indians, non-resident Indians and foreigners from any international sporting event held in India.

 The exemption was given after both the International Cricket Council and the Board of Control for Cricket in India lobbied the Prime Minister, arguing that such a tax sop would help them host the Champions Trophy next year in India. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said the amendment would empower the government to declare an event eligible for such exemption.

 Indias chances of hosting the biennial event had suffered a setback after the ICC said it would take away the event and give it to Pakistan if the Indian government failed to provide tax exemption.

 The threat had come after the income-tax department said it did not have power to rule on issues regarding sporting events held in India and amending the law was the only way of redressing the problem.

 Following this, BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra, Asian Cricket Council chairman Jagmohan Dalmiya and ICC chief Ehsan Mani held a series of meetings with the sports minister, finance minister and Prime Minister, asking them to take immediate steps.

 Chidambaram said such a concession would promote sporting activities in India. He added that the exemption would be valid for all events, provided they are truly multinational and approved by an international body responsible for regulating the relevant sport.

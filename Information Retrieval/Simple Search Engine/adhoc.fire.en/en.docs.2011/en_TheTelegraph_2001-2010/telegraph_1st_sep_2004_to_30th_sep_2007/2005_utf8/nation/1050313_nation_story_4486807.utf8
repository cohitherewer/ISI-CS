 BJP balks, Left won?t let go 

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, March 12: Unsure of allies? response, the BJP has developed cold feet on pressing ahead with a no-confidence motion against the Speaker for an initiative to demarcate the powers of the judiciary and the legislature.

 But the Left is not keen on sweeping the issue under the carpet and is expected to push for a debate in the House.

 The BJP had yesterday floated the no-trust proposal against Somnath Chatterjee for suggesting that a presidential reference be made to the Supreme Court following its ruling to advance the Jharkhand trial of strength. 

 However, BJP president L.K. Advani said in Raipur the issues against the Speaker and the Jharkhand governor ?have ended? with the installation of an NDA government in the state. ?The issue of no-confidence was only mentioned in the NDA meeting but no decision was taken,? he said.

 ?The NDA would meet soon, but I am not aware what will be the outcome. I think the issue has ended,? the BJP chief said. 

 The first hint of a rethink came earlier in Delhi when BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said: ?The circumstances have changed but we will take a formal decision at the NDA meeting on Monday.? 

 NDA sources said the main reason for the change of mind was the fear that some of the allies are unlikely to back the motion.

 A source in the Janata Dal (United) said some BJP allies, like the Telugu Desam Party and the Biju Janata Dal, would not have supported the motion as the Speaker was only advocating the supremacy of the legislature.

 The three parties had also refused to walk out of the all-party meeting convened by the Speaker on Thursday, leaving the BJP red-faced.

 The CPM wants a debate in the House on the powers of the judiciary and the legislature.

 ?We welcome the BJP?s suggestion for a no-trust vote?. We want a full-fledged discussion on the larger issue of separation of powers,? said Nilotpal Basu, the CPM?s leader in the Rajya Sabha.

 He said the party would force a discussion in and outside Parliament regardless of what the BJP decides to do. ?We have to decide the rule under which the debate can take place,? Basu said.

 CPM leader Prakash Karat echoed Basu, saying: ?We will take up the issue of the Supreme Court?s intervention.?

 Basu and Karat delinked the debate from the Jharkhand turmoil. ?It is a larger issue not linked to the recent Jharkhand episode,? Karat said. 

 Chatterjee has already called an emergency meeting of presiding officers of all states and Union territories on March 20.

 Army training to continue 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: India will continue to train officers and personnel of the Royal Nepal Army despite calls for a suspension of military aid to Kathmandu after King Gyanendra?s coup, a top defence ministry source said here today.

 Nepal?s army relies heavily on international military training ? chiefly by India, the UK and the US ? for its officer cadre. The UK, which like India wants restoration of parliament in Nepal, suspended military training for Nepali army officers in its academy at Sandhurst shortly after the coup in Kathmandu.

 Cadets for the RNA are routinely admitted to the National Defence Academy in Khadakvasla and the Indian Military Academy in Dehra Dun. RNA officers also undergo courses of the Indian Army at the staff college and in the college of combat. Last year, about seven companies from the RNA were trained at the Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School in Vairangte, Mizoram. 

 ?Their (Nepal?s) officers are being trained here not being asked to go back or that all military to military relations have been cut off,? a defence ministry official said. ?We are not asking them to go. We are not even thinking of doing so.? 

 The official was speaking just after the foreign secretary Shyam Saran said that India?s military aid to Nepal was ?under continuous review?.

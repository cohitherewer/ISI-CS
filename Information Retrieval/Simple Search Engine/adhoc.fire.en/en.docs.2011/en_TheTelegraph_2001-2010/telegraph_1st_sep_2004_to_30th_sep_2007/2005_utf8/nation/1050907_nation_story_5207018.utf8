 All-weather road to Leh

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The government today approved the building of an alternative route to Leh, a proposal that was pushed in the wake of the 1999 Kargil War when the arterial National Highway 1A was targeted by Pakistani artillery.

 The new route will pass through a tunnel under the Rohtang Pass that will ensure that the road can be used in all weather. 

 At present, there are two routes to Leh ? one from Srinagar that passes through Kargil and the other from Manali. Both these routes are snowed under in winter.

 The alternative route from Manali, which the cabinet committee on security approved today, will be 292 km long and will be built in nine years for about Rs 1,355 crore. The tunnel will be 8.8 km long costing Rs 943.32 crore. Double-laned approaches to the tunnel will be built at both ends of the tunnel.

 The Border Roads Organisation, which maintains the Manali-Leh route, will be entrusted with the building of the alternative route. 

 The Srinagar-Leh NH1A is considered too risky because it has been targeted often. Kargil is barely 4 km from the Line of Control and is visible to artillery observers across the LoC who can direct fire.

 NH1A serves not only the civilian and military establishments in Leh but also has a link to Siachen Glacier where posts at 20,000 feet have to be maintained throughout the year. 

 Pranab Mukherjee said the new road will pass through Nimu, Darchu and Padam in the high-altitude Keylong and Zanskar regions. 

 The defence minister also announced that the security committee had approved the raising of four new territorial army battalions ? one each for Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. These home and hearth battalions are deemed to have been a success in Jammu and Kashmir. The battalions will be composed of local people and will be used in counter-insurgency operations.

 Each battalion would have about 1,000 troops. The territorial army is an auxiliary wing of the armed forces. There are seven home and hearth battalions in Jammu and Kashmir.

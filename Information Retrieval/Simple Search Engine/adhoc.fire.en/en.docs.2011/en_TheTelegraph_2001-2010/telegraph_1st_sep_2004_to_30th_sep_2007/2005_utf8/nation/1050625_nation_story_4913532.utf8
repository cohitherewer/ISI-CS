 No place on bus for Rashid

 Rashid: Disappointed

 New Delhi, June 24: Delhi today turned down Pakistan information minister Sheikh Rashids request to travel to India by the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus scheduled for June 30.

 The government processed Sheikh Rashids application and has declined to accord permission, taking into account all relevant aspects, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said this evening.

 There was enough indication by yesterday ? when the Pakistan ministers application came ? that Delhi would turn him down. But the fact that Delhi went ahead and took the tough stand has made it clear that the UPA government wants Pakistan to realise its unhappiness over Rashids alleged role in running Kashmiri militant camps.

 The Pakistani leader was quoted by agencies as saying in Islamabad that he was deeply disappointed and saddened by Indias decision. 

 He said: I will continue support to the peaceful freedom struggle of Kashmiris. A day will come when I will visit Kashmir.

 Although some Pakistani newspapers had carried reports about President Pervez Musharraf intervening on Rashids behalf and talking to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, no such call came from Islamabad. 

 Yasin Malik, leader of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, who was part of the Hurriyat delegation to Pakistan, had said in Islamabad that Rashid used to run camps to train Kashmiri militants. 

 Pakistan sought to play it down, saying the neighbours should forget the past and focus on taking the peace process forward. 

 However, the controversy was fuelled further when some sections in Islamabad, including a former Pakistani army chief, substantiated Maliks statement.

 India had reacted sharply to the allegation and sought a clarification from Islamabad. But Pakistan has kept mum.

 Delhi is not sure why Pakistan is so keen on sending Rashid on the bus ? whether it wants to keep the training camp controversy alive or kill it. 

 However, the reason for Indias rejection might not be too difficult to guess. It is likely that Singhs response followed the barrage of criticism that the Opposition had hurled at his government for being too Kashmir-centric.

 Intelligence agencies, the home ministry and the foreign ministry all agree that Delhi has made the right move. 

 The bus was to ease travel for Kashmiris on the two sides of the Line of Control and not for others, a foreign ministry official said.

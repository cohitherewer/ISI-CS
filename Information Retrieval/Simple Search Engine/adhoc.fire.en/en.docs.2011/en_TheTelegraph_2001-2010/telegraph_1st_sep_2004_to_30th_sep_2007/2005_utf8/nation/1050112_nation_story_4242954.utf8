 Spanner in king?s visit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Political instability arising out of a students? agitation in Kathmandu against increase in petrol prices and the Maoist rebels? lack of interest in talks with the government appears to have come in the way of King Gyanendra?s visit to India scheduled from Saturday. 

 Although it has not been officially announced, indications are that the trip is off. This is the second time in less than a month that Gyanendra?s proposed tour has had to be called off. 

 The king was keen to visit Delhi and other parts of India from December 23. But the dates were not convenient for the Indian leadership and January 15 was suggested as an alternative. 

 South Block officials are trying to play down the cancellation, saying that though ?some dates? were suggested, they were not finalised. Both sides were in touch with each other for re-scheduling the king?s visit to India at the earliest, they added. 

 Interestingly, the decision to call off the visit comes in the wake of media reports that India was planning to give a tough message to the king and discourage him from dismissing Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. Although Deuba is not very popular in Nepal, he is seen as close to the Indian establishment. 

 The signals coming from Delhi may have been embarrassing for Gyanendra. The political uncertainty in Nepal has provided him with the perfect alibi to cancel his trip.

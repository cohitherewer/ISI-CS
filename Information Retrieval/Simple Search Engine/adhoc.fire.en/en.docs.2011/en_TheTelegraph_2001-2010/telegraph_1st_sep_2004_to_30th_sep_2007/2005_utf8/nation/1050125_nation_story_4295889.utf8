 Sonia wades into 

Rao-YSR 

battle

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi had to step in to ease the tension between the Telengana Rashtra Samiti and the Congress-led government in Andhra Pradesh over ?fake encounter killings? of Maoists. 

 The strain mounted with the TRS threatening to pull out of the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government if it did not put a stop to the violence and resume dialogue with the Maoists.

 The Naxalites had pressured TRS chief and Union labour minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao to lobby the Centre and the state government to begin a fresh round of talks. They appealed to the party?s ministers to quit Reddy?s cabinet. 

 Rao had taken up the matter with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday, while Sonia asked senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who is in charge of Andhra, to hold talks with the TRS chief. Digvijay spoke to Rao on Saturday over phone and met him on Sunday.

 Rao then called up Reddy, who asked the TRS chief to come to Hyderabad for talks. The chief minister also asked him to urge the Naxalites to quit violence. Rao, in turn, asked the chief minister to ensure that ?encounter killings? and ?covert? police action against the extremists do not occur again.

 Home ministry sources, however, seem confident that the second round of talks would take place.

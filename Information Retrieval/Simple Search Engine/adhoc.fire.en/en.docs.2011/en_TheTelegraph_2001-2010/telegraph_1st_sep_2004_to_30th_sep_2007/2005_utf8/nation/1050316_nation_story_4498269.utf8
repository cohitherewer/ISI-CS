 IT bomb hoax 

 Bangalore, March 15: A bomb hoax call sparked off an intensive search on the sprawling Electronics City premises of Infosys Technologies and Wipro on the city?s outskirts, reports our special correspondent.

 Bomb disposal squads were called in the wee hours today to search all the wings of the Infosys headquarters and one unit of Wipro but no bomb was found, said P.K. Thakur, the SP, Bangalore (rural). 

 This is the second time in a week that the IT majors have received hoax calls.

 Last week, a similar call was made to one of Wipro?s offices on MG Road. The call was later traced to a techie, Prashant Kumar, who was arrested but later let off.

 ?At that hour, there were very few staff members but we asked them to leave the place and made a thorough search. We are trying to trace the caller,? he said.

 A spokesperson for Wipro said the company?s human resource department has taken disciplinary action against Prashant. The software programmer told the police that he was checking the security arrangements at his workplace after seeing reports that the IT companies had caught the eye of some extremist groups.

 Digvijay leads Cong protest 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: Thousands of Congress workers today demonstrated near government offices across the state to press their demand for the resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik over the Tangarpada mining issue.

 The gherao of all 314 block offices in the state lasted about 20 minutes. 

 Alleging that huge kickbacks were involved in the mining deals struck by the government, AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh ? who led the agitation here along with J.B. Patnaik ? announced that the Congress will raise the issue both in the Assembly and outside it.

 State PCC chief Jaydev Jena led the agitation in his Assembly constituency of Anandapur in Keonjhar district.

 Shedding light on the government?s alleged failure on all fronts, Singh said Union home minister Shivraj Patil ? who gave a clean chit to Orissa on the law and order front ? could have been ?wrongly briefed?.

 He said Naxalite activities were on the rise in the state and added that the government has failed to properly use funds for the development of the Koraput-Bolangir-Kalahandi region.

 The Congress has also described the chief minister?s efforts to woo Korean steel major Posco as ?yet another deal to loot the state exchequer through its mineral resources?. 

 Former finance minister Ramakrushna Patnaik said the chief minister, for reasons best known to him, has conceded to Posco?s demand for exporting iron ore to Australia and getting coke from that country for its proposed integrated steel plant project in Orissa.

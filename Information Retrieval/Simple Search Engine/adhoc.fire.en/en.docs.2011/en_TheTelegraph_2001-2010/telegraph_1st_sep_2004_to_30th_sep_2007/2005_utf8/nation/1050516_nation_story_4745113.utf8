 Basu: Negative reply

 New Delhi, May 15: The Left parties have dropped more hints that they want to stay away from the first anniversary celebrations of the Congress-led government on May 22, but their final stand will be spelt out after a meeting on May 18. 

 The CPM feels that there is not much to celebrate and so does not want to give company to the Congress when it projects its achievements. 

 CPM leader Jyoti Basu, who was here to attend a politburo meeting, said today that the Left could keep away from the function, though UPA managers are cajoling the comrades to be there.

 It is their celebration. They will celebrate.... I dont think we can participate as there are some differences, Basu told reporters at the conclusion of the meeting. But he added: On May 18, there is a (UPA-Left co-ordination committee) meeting? and then we will see the result. 

 Terming the function a non-issue, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said: We are not concerned with it. We are concerned about the governments performance.

 Politburo member M.K. Pandhe said the party had problems with the function as the occasion will be used by the government to project its achievements while the CPM has reservations on the implementation of the common minimum programme.

 On May 17, the Left parties are meeting to chalk out their joint response to United Progressive Alliance governments indifference to some key matters like the pension bill, the employment guarantee bill and the one on land rights to tribals.

 The two-day politburo meeting evaluated the scorecard of the government . The meeting also deliberated on the modalities to expand the partys base in the Hindi belt. 

 For the CPM, there was good news as veteran leader Harkishen Singh Surjeet was discharged from a hospital in Noida today where he was recuperating after a kidney surgery.

 He is fine and his heart and lungs are functioning normally, a source at the hospital said. The 90-year-old leader had undergone a surgery on May 9 to remove a tumour in his kidney.

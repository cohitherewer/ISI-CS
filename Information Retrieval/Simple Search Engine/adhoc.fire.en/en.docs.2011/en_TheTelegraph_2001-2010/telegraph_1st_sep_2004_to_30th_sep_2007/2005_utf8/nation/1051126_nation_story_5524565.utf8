 Salems lawyers tell torture tale

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Salem

 Mumbai, Nov. 25: A Tada court judge today ordered that Abu Salem be produced in court on November 29 in the light of allegations that he is being tortured in police custody. It had earlier been ordered that he be produced on December 2.

 Salems lawyers said he had spoken of the torture this morning. Advocate M.R. Ansari, one of the lawyers, met Salem from 8 am to 8.30 am when Salem told Ansari that he was being tortured, said the dons lawyer Ashok Sarogi. Salem said that if he were in police custody for two or three more days, he would be killed.

 But Sarogi added that it wasnt possible to say if there were any marks of torture on the dons body. Ansari could not be contacted on the phone.

 Hearing the application, the court directed police not to subject the prisoner to third-degree methods of torture during interrogation.

 Public prosecutor Rohini Salian claimed the allegation was baseless and aimed at hampering investigation. She said the only people complaining about Salems health were his lawyers. She said his medical report, prepared around 3 pm today, mentioned no signs of torture. There was only some sign of migraine.

 But one of Salems lawyers alleged the police were hiding evidence of torture. 

 Salems lawyers also felt their client could not speak freely with them with policemen around him. But the prosecutor said the police were staying close to Salem because of the threats to his life and had, for the same reason, vacated the entire floor where he has been lodged.

 The court asked the police to arrange for a separate space for meetings between Salem and his lawyers, with the cops staying 10 feet away. It also asked that Salem be given a proper diet that includes breakfast, tea and two meals.

 Salem was taken into police custody yesterday in connection with businessman Pradeep Jains murder. 

 Monica transit

 Monica Bedi is set to leave Hyderabad for Bhopal to be produced in a magistrates court in connection with a forged passport obtained from there in the name of Fauzia Usman in 2001. Her judicial custody was extended till December 9 by a Hyderabad court this afternoon.

 Sarogi, who is also Monicas lawyer, flew to Hyderabad from Mumbai today. He said he had received an SMS warning from some people who introduced themselves as ethicssavadhan.org. 

 Mr Sarogi, the fundamental duty is (more) important than professional duties. Your client is not a sant or a priest. He is a don and recognised criminal. (You should) not cross the limitations. Keep your mind professional, he quoted the SMS as saying. 

 He suggested Hindu fundamentalist groups might be behind the threat.

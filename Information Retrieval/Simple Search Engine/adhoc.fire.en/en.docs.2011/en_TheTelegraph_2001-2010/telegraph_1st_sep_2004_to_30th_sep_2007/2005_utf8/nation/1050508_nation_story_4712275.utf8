 Centaur sale probe looms

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 

 New Delhi, May 7: Prodded by the Left, the Centre is likely to announce early next week a probe into the Vajpayee governments sale of two Centaur hotels, now under a cloud following an indictment by the comptroller and auditor general of India (CAG). 

 A top government source said the Left pressure was ?too intense for the government to ignore? as were ?the kind of points raised by the CAG in the sale of Centaur Juhu?. 

 The CAG report, tabled in Parliament, indicted the NDA government and its disinvestment ministry headed by Arun Shourie, saying Centaur Juhu was undersold to a firm called Tulip Hospitality. The company, it said, had a paid-up capital of just Rs 2,000 and had failed to furnish proper bank guarantees or pay the bid money in time. 

 A defiant Shourie told The Telegraph: ?If this government orders a probe, it will be going against a very strong note they themselves sent to the CAG this January, which defended the actions taken by my ministry.?

 The editor-turned-politician said the finance ministry under P. Chidambaram had itself defended his actions in a note sent as late as January 2005, and it would be difficult for ?this government to disown it?. 

 Shourie, however, refused to be drawn on whether the demand for a probe could be termed politically motivated. ?I am always open to investigations by anyone ... I have nothing to hide,? he declared.

 But the Left is buying none of it. Both the CPI and the CPM, which have over the last five years been fighting a losing battle against what they see as dubious disinvestment decisions, seem to have decided that this is one score that has to be settled. 

 CPM leader Nilotpal Basu said, ?The kind of points raised by the CAG make for a criminal offence ... we have been raising these issues before in Parliament and we have assurances from finance minister P. Chidambaram that a CBI probe will be ordered once the CAG report is formally tabled. Its time that happened.? 

 The Left strategy is to try and broaden the scope of the probe once it is announced. RSP leader Abani Roy said, ?We shall aim to enlarge the probe to include the massive underselling of Balco and the siphoning off of reserves in VSNL by its private purchasers. quot; 

 Sources, however, said it is unlikely that the Centre would launch a witch-hunt on the disinvestment front. 

 Besides attacking the sale of Centaur Juhu, the CAG has focused on the sale of the Airport Centaur to the Batras, who apparently had links with the RSS. Its report said the global adviser revalued the property and set a minimum reserve price of Rs 78.3 crore, which was the lower end of the range of suggested prices with an upper limit of Rs 105.7 crore. 

 The Batras picked up the hotel for Rs 83 crore to resell it for about Rs 30 crore more to Sahara in a month. This had attracted the ire of even BJPs staunch ally Shiv Sena.

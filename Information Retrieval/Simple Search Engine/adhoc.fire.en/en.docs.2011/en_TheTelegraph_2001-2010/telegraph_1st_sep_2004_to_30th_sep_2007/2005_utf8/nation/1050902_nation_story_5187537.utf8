 Belgian victim backs off

 - Foreign visitors in abuse turmoil

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Shimla, Sept. 1: The teenaged Belgian tourist who had last week accused a local youth of raping her asked the police yesterday to drop the case.

 The woman now says it wasnt rape but an attempt to rape, Kangra additional superintendent of police Kapil Sharma said.

 Her medical report, however, confirms that she was raped on the evening of August 26, Sharma said. 

 The woman and two male friends had reported the matter to the police the same day.

 Were waiting for the forensic science lab report on the basis of which the final decision will be taken. It will take about a fortnight to get the report, Sharma said.

 Police sources said the 18-year-old woman, a student, wants to return to her country and is not keen to pursue the case. 

 She wants to go back as her parents are worried, Sharma said.

 Most foreign tourists who become victims of crime in India leave quickly and never return to testify ? so there rarely is a conviction. Recently, however, two men in Varanasi were handed life terms for raping a German four years ago. The victim had returned this January to identify the rapists and testify against them.

 The Belgian woman, however, was unhappy that the news had reached her parents and relatives back home. She blamed the media coverage, police sources said.

 The teenager arrived at the police station yesterday clutching newspaper clippings. 

 I wouldnt have reported the matter had I known the consequences. I want to take back my case, she reportedly told an officer.

 The woman and her two friends were staying at a guesthouse in Dharamsala. While her male companions were away trekking ? she had to cut short her trip because she fell ill -- she was allegedly raped by a 20-year-old youth, Tashi Dorje, at knifepoint.

 The police have arrested Dorje, a Tibetan from Ladakh who had come to Dharamsala in search of greener pastures.

 Heartland gang war fells MLA

 - Precision strike on way to wedding

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Nov. 29: Krishnanand Rai was on his way to a wedding. He never reached.

 The don-turned-legislator and six supporters were mowed down by assailants as his four-car convoy neared the Ghazipur-Ballia border, 312 km from the Uttar Pradesh capital.

 Authorities said gang rivalry could be behind the planned attack.

 The BJP MLA from Ghazipur district, had been locked in a turf war with Inde- pendent legislator Mukhtar Ansari, another don-turned-politician. 

 Ansari, an accused in the October riots in neighbouring Mau, is now in a Ghazipur jail.

 Rai had opened a cricket match at 12.30 pm and was on his way to Ballia. Unknown to him, his assassins lay in wait in a Sumo and on six motorcycles.

 As Rais convoy stopped near Basarnia village, the assailants caught up with them. The six motorcycles surrounded Rais car and, before his associates could react, began firing. All the seven persons in the car, including the MLA, were killed.

 After the murders, the assailants sped off. It was a swift and meticulously planned operation, said inspector-general of police, Varanasi range, Arun Gupta.

 Rai, who was wanted in at least 12 cases of murder and abduction, had hit the headlines in connection with the recent kidnapping of Golu, a boy from Bihar. Bihar police had accused him of detaining the six-year-old. Rai had denied the charge.

 Rai and Ansari had been rivals for long. The rivalry intensified after Rai defeated Ansaris brother Afzal in Ghazipurs Mahumabad Assembly constituency in 2002. 

 In January this year, Rai had targeted an Ansari convoy in Lucknows cantonment area. During the last general elections, there were reports of clashes between the two groups in which three persons were killed.

 Sources, however, said Rai had of late been facing a revolt in his gang. Although the BJP is taking the name of Mukhtar Ansari, we are not sure if the jailed MLA had any hand (in todays murder). We are keeping other theories open, including that of an intra-gang feud, Gupta said.

 Principal secretary (home) Aloke Sinha said the murder appears to be part of the ongoing gang war. Two teams of special task force personnel have left for Ghazipur, he added.

 As news of the murder reached the state capital, hundreds of BJP workers hit the streets. In Ghazipur, shops downed shutters. BJP workers put up road blocks at various points of the district and stopped passing vehicles. Police sources in the district said BJP supporters are planning to take Rais body to his village.

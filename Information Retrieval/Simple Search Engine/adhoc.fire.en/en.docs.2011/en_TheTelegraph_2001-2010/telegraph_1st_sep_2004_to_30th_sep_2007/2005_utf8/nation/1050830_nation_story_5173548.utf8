 Singh unfazed, BJP unsure

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The Prime Minister is believed to be of the view that P. Chidambaram had committed no impropriety and there was no question of dropping him from the cabinet.

 A source close to Manmohan Singh said the Prime Minister was satisfied with Chidambarams statement in the Rajya Sabha, adding that there is no issue.

 Keen not to lose an opportunity to embarrass the UPA and especially the Prime Minister, the BJP is determined to stall both Houses of Parliament on the concluding day tomorrow on its demand for the finance ministers resignation. Today, the party joined the ADMKs chorus of protest only in the Upper House and allowed the Lok Sabha to transact business.

 Sources said they expected Singh to be in the House tomorrow to make a statement on his visit to Kabul. That is when we will ask for Chidambarams resignation and ask Singh to clarify his position, a BJP source said.

 But BJP sources conceded that they had not drawn up a long-drawn campaign against Chidambaram. The issue will last as long as Parliament is in session, a BJP leader said. 

 They also denied reports that the BJP was trying to revive its links with the ADMK, which raised the issue first in the House, through the controversy. 

 In law, there are two key words, similar and common. We (the BJP and ADMK) are raising similar issues, not common issues and the objective is common. But there is nothing beyond that, the leader said.

 The Congress echoed the Prime Ministers opinion that there was no breach of propriety by Chidambaram. The DMK also came to his defence.

 The Congress was apprehensive that the DMK, its key ally at the Centre and in Tamil Nadu, may take a dim view of the situation if the ADMK sustained the pitch.

 A source close to DMK leader M. Karunanidhi said he would not let Chidambaram down.

 Clarify: CPM

 The CPM said the issue raised several questions that the government should answer.

 It raises several questions. We think the government should clarify on all such questions, CPMs Nilotpal Basu told a television channel.

 A group of women lawyers in Delhi came out in defence of Nalini, saying the attack on her was disturbing and regressive in this era of women empowerment.

 Measles in quake camp

 Muzaffarabad, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Health authorities were racing to control an outbreak of measles at a camp for earthquake survivors in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir today after a 10-month-old baby died of the disease, a doctor said.

 With a harsh winter setting in, fears are growing that sickness could kill cold and poorly nourished survivors but the UN says there has been no spike in the mortality rate since the weather deteriorated last week.

 Nearly a dozen children have been admitted to a field hospital... from a nearby camp, said a doctor who visited the clinic in Hattian Bala, 45 km southeast of Muzaffarabad, the hard-hit capital of PoK. 

 The doctor, who works for an international agency, said the boy had died of measles on Thursday. Health ministry officials were not available for comment.

 The UN Childrens Fund has vaccinated thousands of people since the quake struck but agency paediatrician Sajjad Gillani, confirming the outbreak, said some children might have been missed in the drive. The disease has possibly broken out as that particular camp might not have been covered during the immunisation campaign, he said.

 Laloo apology to Muslims for error

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Oct. 3: Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav today profusely apologised to Muslims for not doing for them what was expected from his partys governments during the past 15 years.

 Ab hum koi bhool nahi karenge. Humse galti hua. Aadmi thokar kha-kar hi seekhta hai. (From now on, I will not commit any mistake. I did commit mistakes. But a human being learns from the jolts he gets), Laloo Prasad said at a minorities convention here today.

 The RJD has taken anxious note of Lok Janshakti Party president Ramvilas Paswan appeal for installing a Muslim as chief minister and the good crowd his meetings have been drawing in parts of Bihar.

 It is believed that a split in Muslim votes ? caused by the LJP as well as the Janata Dal (United) ? was responsible for the RJDs poor show during the February elections. Support of the vast majority of Muslim voters for Laloo Prasad is understood to be a significant factor that kept the RJD in office for 15 years.

 I am ready to rectify my mistakes. But it is your duty to maintain amity and check the advance of the fascist forces. As for job reservations to Muslims, we will come out with our policy in the manifesto tomorrow, the RJD chief said.

 The Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz, a powerful organisation of the deprived Muslims, has strongly opposed any move to grant any reservation to (all) Muslims as a separate category. It has instead favoured reservations only for backward and dalit Muslims.

 Till recently, the RJD had favoured reservations to Muslims as a whole but after the protest from the Mahaz, the party has been having second thoughts and, consequently, Laloo Prasad has refrained from speaking on the matter.

 The Mahaz has appealed to the Muslims to support the JD (U) for its clear and constitutional stand on the matter and also to punish the RJD for failing to do much for the uplift of poor Muslims during its 15-year rule.

 The RJD has merely used Muslims as a vote category without bothering for its welfare. Fifteen years was a long time in which the RJD government should have acted. But that did not happen, Mahaz president Ali Anwar said.

 RJD sources said the manifesto is likely to have the reformed stand on job reservations for Muslims.

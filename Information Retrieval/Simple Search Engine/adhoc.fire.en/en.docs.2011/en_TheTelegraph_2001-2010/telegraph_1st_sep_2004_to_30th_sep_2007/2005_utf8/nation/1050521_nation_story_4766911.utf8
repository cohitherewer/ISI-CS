 Shuffled collectors see sliver of hope

 New Delhi, May 20: District collectors might get the much-needed reprieve from frequent transfers so that they can finish their work without being bothered by immediate political bosses.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh showed concern over the frequent transfers while addressing the two-day national-level meet of collectors in Delhi today and said no system could deliver if top civil servants were changed without notice.

 Singh favoured a minimum security of tenure for judging the performance of these civil servants. At present, only the director of the CBI and the cabinet secretary enjoy this kind of tenure security for two years.

 The Prime Ministers statement comes close on the heels of the transfer of the district magistrates of Gopalganj and Siwan in Bihar, who had created news by ordering the externment of Rashtriya Janata Dal Lok Sabha members Mohammed Shahabuddin and Sadhu Yadav but were transferred before the completion of their tenures.

 A major issue which has arisen is security of tenure of key functionaries like district collectors and superintendent of police. I do recognise you are entitled to ask for this? short tenure does not produce the desired results.

 The Prime Minister said the Centre on its own could not move much on this and will have to work along with the state governments. But I do propose to bring this issue in the National Development Council as an integral part of improving the quality of administration and making it more transparent.

 Singh asked them to ensure that the objectives of Bharat Nirman of providing 100 per cent connectivity to villages through roads, electricity and telecommunications and ensuring 100 per cent coverage under safe water supply by 2009 are met.

 In addition, we aim to create one crore hectare of additional irrigation and 60 lakh houses through the Indira Awas Yojna. You are the critical agents for ensuring that the new deal to rural India genuinely transforms rural lives and livelihoods, he said.

 The speech was full of sentences meant to placate the Left, which recently has expressed displeasure over the UPA government not implementing pro-poor policies in its first year of tenure.

 To be ethically neutral in a context of inequality, you have to be partisan ? partisan towards the poor, the weaker sections, the minorities, women and scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and all those disadvantaged people who need support of the state.

 Station food set for price jump

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: Feel like having a go at the chicken cutlet you had last time when you went to see off a friend to the railway station?

 Chances are the cutlet would taste the same, but your pocket might be lighter.

 Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav has ordered an increase in licence fees for permanent catering units, parking stands and public call offices at stations. The plan is to earn additional revenue through these tariff hikes so that he could spare passengers the burden of increased fares next year.

 The hike, however, may not be across the board as the railways propose to base it on actual earnings.

 The licence fee has not been renewed for long. I would like the licence fee for all permanent catering units to be revised within two months based on actual sales to increase this income by five-six times. Similarly, the licence fee for parking stands, PCOs and advertisements should also be revised according to potential within two months, Laloo Prasad said.

 Passenger fares have not been hiked to help the poor. The growth in passenger volume will offset the additional cost that the railways incurred due to the hike in diesel price. Additional revenues will be generated by increase in licence fee and other methods, the minister added.

 Asked about the possibility of food items costing more at railway stations once the tariff hike comes into effect, Laloo Prasad said: If the quality of food is good, the price has to be good.

 The decision has been taken to offset the loss of more than Rs 400 crore in catering services in 2004-05.

 Its a good move and will certainly improve the revenues for railways, said M. Ravindra, former chairman of the railway board. The cost of food may not go up for passengers across the board. It can be monitored and the railways have an efficient method of doing it.

 After a meeting of general managers from different divisions, Laloo Prasad said special attention would be given to passenger amenities, punctuality and cleanliness.

 He said the ministry was in talks with a Japanese company, whose name he declined to reveal, to lay high-speed tracks between New Delhi and Howrah and New Delhi and Mumbai for freight movement.

 The minister also clarified that he was not against people drinking Pepsi or Coke. 

 My compliments to those who dare to drink Pepsi and Coke. A parliamentary standing committee report had pointed to the existence of pesticide in these drinks. Railways will serve milk, curd, butter milk and also Pepsi, he said.

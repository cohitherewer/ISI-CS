 Tsunami cuts short pilgrims? progress 

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Poompuhar (Tamil Nadu), Jan. 1: They had come to wash their sins. The giant waves washed them away. 

 Ten members of an income-tax officer?s family from Hubli, Karnataka, were killed when they went for a dip at the holy confluence of the Cauvery and the Bay of Bengal here, a flourishing port during the reign of the Early Cholas (1 AD to 2 AD). 

 The tsunamis struck Poompuhar ? at the northern tip of the worst-hit Nagapattinam district ? precisely at 8.58 am last Sunday, according to witnesses. 

 ?Only two members of that officer?s family survived ? an elderly woman and her granddaughter ? as they had stayed back in the cottage,? recalled K. Murugesan, a tourism official who saw the waves slam in. 

 Six of the bodies were soon washed ashore. The officer?s relatives took them back after police contacted them with the two survivors? help. But the other four, found a day later in a highly decomposed state, had to be buried here, said Murugesan. 

 The police, coping with the overwhelming relief efforts, could not supply the names of these casualties. 

 As the devastated families were struggling to come to terms with the tragedy, Murugesan had another worry. The flow of tourists has dried up in the peak winter season to this must-see destination on Tamil Nadu?s tourism map. 

 Apart from the Cauvery confluence, archaeological excavations have unearthed Roman and Greek coins, pottery, beads, urns and the existence of a Buddhist vihar in the town, pointing to a rich cosmopolitan culture that the Early Cholas had built through their strong maritime contacts with ancient Europe. 

 Poompuhar is also the theatre of Silapadhikaram (The Story of the Anklet), one of the greatest Tamil love epics, penned by great Jain poet Elango Adigal. 

 Now, the town linked to Kannagi?s story lies in a shambles. The tsunamis have ravaged Poompuhar and two of its adjoining fishing villages, Pudukuppam and Nachiarkuppam, killing at least 300 people and rendering another 3,000 homeless. 

 The waves ripped the eastern wall of the Pavai Mandram complex ? housing eight damsels in various romantic moods, as described in another Tamil classic, Thirukkural, built by the previous DMK government ? and slammed in several boats from the sea. 

 The small sea-facing statue of Kannagi, the protagonist of Silapadhikaram, has withstood the force of the tsunami, but doesn?t instil much hope in tourism officials, who fear it will take a long time for tourism to revive here. 

 At the moment, however, everyone is taken up with the emergency situation. Five kilometres away in a nearby village, the government has organised a relief camp at the sprawling Srinvasa Higher Secondary School for the fishermen families of Poompuhar. 

 Health department officials have plunged into the Herculean task of offering all necessary medical and sanitary help from tetanus injections, chlorinated water and drugs for dysentery to prevent an outbreak. Oral rehydration solution sachets have also been stocked sufficiently, said Dr Inbasagaran, the medical officer at the camp. 

 A major source of tension is the lack of sanitary toilet facilities in the camps, where the displaced persons are being forced to defecate in open spaces despite warnings. ?We are sprinkling entire campuses where these camps are located with disinfectant,? said a health official. The hand-pumps at the camps are also being chlorinated to avoid water-borne diseases, he added. 

 As the Jayalalithaa government began moving in relief materials to the various camps, the inmates at several centres said private individuals and NGOs like the Red Cross were the ones reaching out to them with food and other essentials. 

 Another anger at the camps was over the clothes donated in charity. ?We do not want old clothes. We have our self-respect and we want new clothes, particularly lungis and shirts for our men, sarees, blouses and undergarments for our women and trousers and shirts for our children,? said T. Govindaraj, a displaced fishermen.

 Heartland on the boil 

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Jan. 27: Anger continued to singe the streets of Allahabad as another Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supporter was killed yesterday, just a day after the murder of a party MLA and two others.

 Rumours added fuel to the fire sparking gun battles between the BSP and the Samajwadi Party supporters and skirmishes with the police.

 The authorities were forced to proclaim prohibitory orders and the Rapid Action Force was deployed. Parts of Allahabad, especially the streets leading to Dhumanganj where Tuesday?s murders had taken place, witnessed fresh clashes today.

 Despite the arrest of a key accused in the case this morning in Lucknow, there was no sign of peace in Allahabad. Roles were reversed as a mob charged at the police and pelted stones at them in the Naini and Sadiapur areas of the city. 

 Additional superintendent of police Suparna was hurt in trying to stop a skirmish. 

 ?Some mischievous elements are spreading wild rumour to fan trouble,? said Allahabad inspector-general A.C. Sharma.

 The police have snapped cable TV links in Allahabad to control the spread of rumour and the army has been put on high alert. The police have also rounded up 93 people for causing arson in the city.

 Tuesday?s murders have given rise to a ?political sangam (union)? with the Congress and the BSP closing ranks and deciding to hit the streets in protest. BSP president Mayavati demanded immediate proclamation of President?s rule in the state to put end to ?this Kangsa raj?. A team of party leaders also met governor T.V. Rajeswar. 

 The police?s hurried cremation of the three bodies yesterday to prevent a backlash had the relatives of the victims crying foul.

 First-time MLA Raju Pal?s wife Puja went on air yesterday venting her anger. Soon after, hundreds of BSP supporters fanned out on streets across Allahabad, smashing cars, setting police outposts on fire and indulging in gun battles. 

 The Rajapuram outpost, which falls on the way to Dhumanganj, was set ablaze and armed supporters of the BSP raided the Dumanganj police station. A section of the supporters also attacked the house of Samajwadi Party MLA Bijma Yadav last night. In the fierce gun battle between the two parties that followed, a BSP supporter was killed.

 Lucknow police have arrested Ashraf, brother of Samajwadi Party MP from Phulpur in Allahabad, Atiq Ahmed, from his house. Ashraf was allegedly present during the attack on Pal. He was taken into transit remand and will be shifted to Allahabad tomorrow.

 Cutting short her campaign in Bihar, Mayavati reached Allahabad this morning. She demanded a CBI inquiry into the killings and imposition of President?s rule in Uttar Pradesh.

 The Congress, too, has asked for a CBI probe but is silent on the demand for President?s rule. 

 ?We have full sympathy for the BSP president. The law and order situation has reached its nadir,? said state Congress chief Salman Khurshid.

 She also alleged that the city superintendent of police and some other policemen had a role in the killings, which the state police denied vociferously. 

 ?We have set up a team of seven police officers in Allahabad headed by an additional SP. The team is on the job of investigation. There is no question of a CBI probe here,? said Aloke Sinha, principal secretary in the state home ministry.

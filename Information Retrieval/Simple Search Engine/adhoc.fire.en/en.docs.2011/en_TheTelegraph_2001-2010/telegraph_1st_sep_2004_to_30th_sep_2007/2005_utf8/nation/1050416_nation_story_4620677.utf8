Visakhapatnam, April 15: Maoists landed in a tribal hamlet in Visakhapatnam district late last night in a bid to pre-empt the administration?s interaction with villagers that was institutionalised early this month.

 For 12 hours till early this morning, 50 armed rebels camped in Duggiwada village in G.K. Veedhi mandal and conducted their own version of Praja Patham, the government programme that takes the administration to villagers.

 ?We wanted to send a signal to the Congress government that we were opposed to the programme that only spread false promises among people,? said a prominent Maoist leader who took charge of the hamlet of 700 people.

 Information reaching the state headquarters here, however, indicated the rebels wanted to detain the officials who would come for the Praja Patham.

 Through Thursday night, they blocked people and all vehicular traffic in the forest village near the Orissa border and went door to door, asking about residents? pressing livelihood problems.

 ?The Maoists urged us to take to collection of forest produce and sell it in the open market,? said Gurama, a tribal.

 The rebels are said to have promised they would compel the forest and Girican Corporation officials to give remunerative prices for the tribal produce of gum, brooms, nuts, tamarind and medicinal products.

 The corporation buys these from tribals to sell them in the market.

 Later in the night, the Maoists held a public meeting to warn the tribals against the ?deceptions? practised by the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government.

 ?The Congress has made a farce of peace talks by killing 60 of our comrades in the last two months,? Dakkanna, a rebel leader, told them.

 ?They told us about the scope of the peace talks with the government and how it failed to broker peace,? a tribal said.

 The rebels also held a gram sabha (village council) that took the shape of a ?praja durbar (people?s court)?, where sarpanch Gopanna was told by Maoist Ganganna to inform villagers about how he spent government funds for development.

 ?You have accounted for Rs 430 on entertaining police and revenue officials. You should not do such things,? Ganganna warned the sarpanch.

 The rebels held a cultural programme and distributed Naxalite literature, including on child healthcare. ?She (a woman activist) told us how to treat dehydration and insect bites,? said Bhagyavathi, a tribal midwife.

 They also taught the youths to use small arms and make weapons for self-defence. 

 ?They taught us how to use bows and arrows with modern equipment and also use uncomplicated pistols,? said Ramana, a tribal.

 The Maoists, belonging to the Andhra-Orissa border committee led by Sudhakar, came with heavy artillery, expecting police presence.

 They interrogated Gopanna for over three hours for information on police or revenue officials and took up positions on elevated places and posted sentries.

 ?Fortunately, there were no policemen in the vicinity. Otherwise, there could have been a bloodbath,? said Sarakka, 18, who was married hardly four days ago. Her husband, Goverdhan, ran away after the Maoists entered the village.

 The police reached only this afternoon but the villagers were tightlipped. Some later said they were urged by the Maoists to keep them informed about the arrival of the police.

 ?We have sent search parties all around and are combing the area,? said Sanjay Kumar Jain, the district superintendent of police.

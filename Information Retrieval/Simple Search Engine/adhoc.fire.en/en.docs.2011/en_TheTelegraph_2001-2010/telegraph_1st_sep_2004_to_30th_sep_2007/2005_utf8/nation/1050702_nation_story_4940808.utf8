 Cong finally takes a stand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 1: The Congress has demanded prosecution of Ali Mohammad under the countrys criminal law, saying Muslim personal law or fatwas have no relevance while dealing with acts of barbarism.

 It is the barbaric rape of a young woman who is the mother of five children. This is a heinous crime which we condemn unequivocally and demand stringent punishment against the guilty, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.

 The Congresss strong stand comes in the backdrop of the BJPs charge that the ruling party is shying away from making its position clear on Imranas rape by father-in-law Ali Mohammad and the subsequent pronouncement by Muslim clerics in Muzaffarnagar that she should regard her husband as her son.

 Singhvi rejected the BJP charge that the Congress was maintaining silence and accused the Opposition party of seeking to fish in troubled waters by politicising the rape. The BJP was invoking the Muslim personal law to gain political mileage, he said.

 Just as we condemn the rape and demand stringent punishment, we also condemn politicisation of the issue by the BJP, said the Congress spokesperson.

 Singhvi contradicted the reported view of Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Salman Khursheed that the Imrana rape case was a religious matter.

 Fatwas or personal laws are irrelevant when criminal action is to be initiated under the countrys criminal law, the Congress leader said. 

 The chairperson of the National Commission for Women, Girija Vyas, has written to the Uttar Pradesh government to refer the rape case to a fast-track court.

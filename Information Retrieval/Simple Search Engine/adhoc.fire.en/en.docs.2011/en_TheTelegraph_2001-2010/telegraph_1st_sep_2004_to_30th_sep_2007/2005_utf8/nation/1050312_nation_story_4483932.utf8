 Pervez looks for a date

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, March 11: President Pervez Musharraf is most likely to be at Calcutta?s Eden Gardens for the second Test between India and Pakistan, beginning on Wednesday, sources said today.

 ?The President is likely to visit Calcutta some time after March 15 to watch the match,? a source said.

 Foreign ministry spokesperson Jalil Abbas Jilani confirmed that Musharraf had accepted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s invitation but the exact dates of his trip are being worked out. 

 ?We are looking into the President?s schedule to see what dates will be convenient for him to travel to India,? Jilani said, without disclosing which city he is likely to visit.

 He added that the two countries are consulting each other to work out the details.

 Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, too, is unaware of Musharraf?s schedule as are officials in the Indian high commission in Islamabad. ?It will take a little while to finalise the programme,? a high commission official said.

 The Indian government?s invitation, which was conveyed to the President by high commissioner Shiv Shankar Menon, came a couple of hours after Singh told the Lok Sabha about the decision yesterday. 

 ?It is my desire that the people of the neighbouring country should feel free to enter this country,? the Prime Minister said, expressing hope that Musharraf and his family enjoy their stay in India.

 The President had last week shown interest in watching a match if invited. ?I love watching any sport. I would love watching cricket. (But) I don?t believe in going without an invitation anywhere. If there is an invitation, one would certainly like to consider,? he had told an English daily in Islamabad.

 Musharraf will be the second military ruler to watch a cricket match on Indian soil. In February 1987, the late Zia-ul-Haq had cheered on the Pakistan side from the stands in Jaipur.

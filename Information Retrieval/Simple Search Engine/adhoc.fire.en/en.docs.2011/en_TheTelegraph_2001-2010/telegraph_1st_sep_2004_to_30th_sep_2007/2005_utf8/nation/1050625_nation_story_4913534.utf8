 Firms pay actors to puff: Minister

 New Delhi (PTI): Charging the tobacco 

 industry with paying actors to smoke on screen, Union health 

 minister Ambumani Ramadoss has said he is determined to 

 implement the ban come what may.

 I am not afraid of any lobby howsoever powerful it is, the minister declared on Thursday.

 Ramadoss claimed having information that firms were directly paying actors to puff in films. Unfortunately, I have no proof, he added.

 It is my duty to prevent this. We did not take a decision overnight but after deliberating on the issue for quite some time, the minister said.

 Ramadoss recalled that there was a hue and cry in the US Congress over tobacco companies allegedly paying Hollywood stars in the seventies to glamorise smoking.

 I am not against the film industry but the fact that it is being used by the tobacco industry, he said, adding that out of 800 to 900 movies made in India every year, 76 per cent depict smoking scenes.

 Citing a study by medical journal Lancet, Ramadoss said 52 per cent children take to the habit influenced by films and smoking scenes in films are 16 per cent more effective than direct tobacco advertisement.

 When millions of people give polio drops to their children inspired by Amitabh Bachchans appeal, the impact of smoking scenes is not difficult to imagine, he said, lauding Tamil superstar Rajnikanth for not showing smoking scenes in his latest film Chandramukhi.

 As the countrys health minister, I am concerned that 40 per cent of the health-related problems from cancer to cardiovascular ailments, kidney, skin allergy, lung problems and miscarriages are caused due to smoking, Ramadoss said.

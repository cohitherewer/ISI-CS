 Flight protest

 Kochi, June 20 (PTI): Air-India authorities were in a spot early today when passengers of one of its flight from Doha, delayed by two days, refused to get off protesting against the airlines attitude.

 The flight was held up in Bahrain due to a technical snag.

 Alleging that the airline authorities in Bahrain did not provide them with accommodation or food for two days, the passengers shouted slogans inside the jet and refused to alight for nearly three hours, airport sources said.

 After much persuasion by Air-India officials here, the passengers got off and the jet left for Thiruvananthapuram.

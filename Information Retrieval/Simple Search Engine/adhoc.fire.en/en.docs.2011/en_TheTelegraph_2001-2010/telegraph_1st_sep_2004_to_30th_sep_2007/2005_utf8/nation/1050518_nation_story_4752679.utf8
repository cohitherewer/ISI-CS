 Anjali gets a second chance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, May 17: In a rare gesture, a military court today put off the trial of Flying Officer Anjali Gupta till May 20, giving her another opportunity to hire a civil defence counsel.

 When the prosecution was about to commence proceedings today, the general court martial (GCM) on its own gave her time till Friday to enlist the services of a defence counsel. 

 Yesterday, the GCM had arraigned her on seven charges of financial irregularities, indiscipline and insubordination and turned down her plea for a 20-day adjournment to help choose a civil lawyer. 

 Today, however, Group Captain V. Ganesh, the presiding officer, said: She has been given an opportunity to defend herself effectively. 

 On May 10, Gupta was given a five-day breather for the same purpose. After the court met yesterday, the flying officer was told that she would not get any more time.

 She has not mentioned a specific timeframe (to hire a civil lawyer), the group captain said today, implying that she has to specify a reasonable period within which she will find a lawyer. 

 The GCM stands adjourned up to 0900 hours on May 20 to help her procure a defence counsel prior to commencement of the prosecution, he said.

 Guptas request for release from close arrest, however, was turned down on the ground that it was for the air force to decide on this. She also pleaded that she would not be able to hire a defence counsel in three days.

 Teen din mein hum Delhi nahin pahuch sakte hain. Agar 15 ya 20 din ka adjournment ho tho hum Delhi se civil lawyer la sakte hain (In three days we cannot reach Delhi. If the adjournment was for 15 or 20 days we could have brought a civil lawyer from Delhi), said the IAF officers mother, Uma, outside the court hall.

 Uma complained that her daughter was not being allowed to meet anybody under close arrest inside the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE) campus here.

 Group Captain Ganesh also adjourned the GCM for Gupta to submit her application asking for more time. 

 In her plea, Gupta sought an adjournment for 20 days and release from close arrest to meet the four civil lawyers shortlisted by her. I am in touch with my defence counsel. Time and again, I have made representations to the administration (of ASTE) and the court to allow me to meet the defence counsel in person and engage his services, she said in her application.

 I also need more time as I have not only to discuss the case, but also hand over confidential documents pertaining to the court martial and the correspondence between me and the AOC-in-C (Air Officer Commanding in Chief, training command, Bangalore), prior to the summary of evidence. 

 In a setback to Gupta, a division bench of Karnataka High Court has declined to act on her petition for a stay on the GCM.

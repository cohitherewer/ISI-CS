 Nod to ease noise ban

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Supreme Court today upheld an amendment to the noise pollution act empowering state governments to relax use of loudspeakers for two hours till midnight 15 days a year during festivals and other public occasions.

 A division bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice Ashok Bhan upheld the amendment made by Parliament in 2002 to Rule 5(2) of the Noise Pollution (Control and Regulation) Rule, 2000. 

 We are upholding the validity of the rule in this regard, subject to some conditions, the court said.

 The amendment enables the states to relax the rule between 10 pm and 12 midnight. 

 But the apex court made it clear that the period can neither be relaxed nor altered further and the relaxation has to be notified by the state government concerned in advance. 

 The bench also said the 15-day period should not be extended. 

 A non-government organisation had filed a public interest litigation, contending that the amendment should be struck down.

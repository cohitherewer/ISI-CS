 Nuke pact hope on horizon

 - India-baiter Burton 

in Delhi for talks

 Burton: Give-and-take

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: The chances of the Indo-US deal on civilian nuclear energy getting the US Congresss approval have brightened with India-baiter Dan Burton saying the pact is likely to go through if Delhi could work out a definite separation of its civilian and military facilities.

 I am leaning towards the nuclear agreement. I think most of our delegation is, the US Congressman said.

 However, India must move to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities as agreed under the terms of the nuclear technology-sharing deal. We want to make sure there is a definite separation between civil and military usage of nuclear technology, Burton said. And if that is guaranteed and worked out, I think the Congress of the US will look upon this favourably.

 Burton is leading a US congressional delegation to the region. On Wednesday, the delegation will leave for Pakistan to hold talks with the leadership in Islamabad.

 His remarks are significant as Burton is a leading member of the Pakistani caucus in the US Congress and has often been critical of the growing ties between Washington and Delhi. 

 The US delegation is scheduled to meet a number of key Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, during its stay in Delhi.

 Burton said he was very encouraged by the improvement in Indias relations with both the US and Pakistan. As one of the people who has been considered an opponent of some of the things that have happened in India, I wanted to be here and lead this delegation, he said. Because I wanted them to know that everyone in America, everyone in America, wants to work with India and see our relationship grow.

 US ambassador David Mulford had said recently that if India comes out with a road map on how it plans to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities, the Bush administration could use it to get the Congresss nod for bringing about changes in American domestic law. 

 The existing US laws prevent any transfer of nuclear technology to India since it is neither a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty nor a declared nuclear power.

 Mulford had stressed that once the US was convinced about the Indian intention to segregate its nuclear facilities, Washington could go ahead with changing the domestic laws and would not have to wait for the process of separation of the facilities in India to be completed.

 The governments proposed separation plans of the nuclear facilities have come under flak from some quarters in India as there are apprehensions that Delhi was giving up its sovereign right to salvage the nuclear agreement with the Americans.

 But last week, a senior official of the foreign ministry said the government was under no compulsion to go ahead with the deal and the country has the right to pull out if it feels its national interests were being compromised.

 No one is forcing us to go ahead with the deal. We will continue to weigh the pros and cons. At the end of it, if we feel that we are losing more than we are gaining, we have every right to pull out of the agreement, the official said.

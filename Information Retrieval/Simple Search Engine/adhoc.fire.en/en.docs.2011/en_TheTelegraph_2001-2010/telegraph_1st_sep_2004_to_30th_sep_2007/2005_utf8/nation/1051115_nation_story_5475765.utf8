 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Roshni (Poonch), Nov. 14: Shaking hands and greeting each other warmly, Indian and Pakistani officials today opened the fourth point along the Line of Control to facilitate movement of quake relief.

 Col. Deepak Saini of India and Lt Col. Eidel of Paki- stan did the honours at Roshni-Kanna post this morning after which 10 truckloads of relief were ferried to the other side.

 As in the case of the Chakan da Bagh, Uri and Teethwal points, porters carried the material because the area has been unmotorable since the October 8 quake.

 The Indian Army has set up a medical camp at the post, which includes a 10-bed hospital, a meeting place for divided families and a community food centre.

 Army spokesman Col. D.K. Badola said India sent 460 sacks of rice, 560 sacks of flour and 1,740 iron sheets. Pakistan sent one truckload of relief, including eatables, cotton and bedding.

 The point was opened in presence of Poonch deputy commissioner M.R. Thakur and his Kotli counterpart from Pakistan Khwaja Naeem.

 As yet, only relief material has gone through the points. Human traffic will be allowed as soon as formalities are done, said B.R. Sharma, divisional commissioner of Jammu zone.

 At Kaman post, the much-hyped return of 15 Indians stranded in PoK since the quake did not happen with Pakistani officials saying they have no knowledge of any such crossover. 

 At a meeting this afternoon between army officers of the two sides near the damaged Aman Setu, Pakistani personnel said they were not aware of any such proposal to send them back.

 Srinagar regional passport officer S.L. Sriramlu had said yesterday the Kaman post would be opened to allow stranded passengers of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus to return.

 We have information that 10-15 citizens who had travelled on the bus before the earthquake want to return home tomorrow. For this purpose, the Kaman post-Chakoti point on the LoC will be opened tomorrow, he had said. 

 It is not known whether they will be allowed to come back via the Aman Setu.

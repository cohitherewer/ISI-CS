 Anara back in CD storm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES 

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: Anara Gupta?s family today said it would approach the President and the Prime Minister for a CBI probe into the porn CD case that the former Miss Jammu is accused of being involved in.

 Scientists at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Chandigarh have examined the CD sent by Jammu and Kashmir police ?frame by frame? and concluded that the girl is Anara. The Hyderabad forensic science laboratory, which had given a clean chit to her, however, stood by its report.

 ?We worked very hard on the CD. By using video-frame superimposition of the woman on the CD and comparing it with Anara, we concluded that there was a resemblance in terms of lips, eyes and nose. Other features like the shape and size of the nasal cavities came very close to that of Anara. The eyes and scar on the right eyebrow also matched,? said an official connected with the examination.

 Reports that appeared yesterday on CFSL?s findings left her family members fuming. They charged the police with ?planting a concocted story? to save their skin. Anara had alleged that the police had tortured her and forced a confession when she was in custody. 

 ?The police are again using their old tactics of misusing the media,? her Delhi-based maternal uncle Sanjoy Sachdev told reporters.

 The family will submit a memorandum to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by tomorrow, he said. ?We have been saying from the start that we want a CBI probe.

 ?The advocate representing in court the six policemen suspended in connection with the case came on TV providing details about the report. What is his locus standi to disclose the report?? 

 Trashing the reports on the findings as ?baseless?, Sachdev said: ?The news stories yesterday said, quoting the (forensic) report, that the scar above the right eyebrow of the girl in the porn CD matched with Anara. But interestingly, there is no scar on the forehead of the girl in the porn film.? Sachdev also distributed what he claimed is a still of the girl in the film to prove his point.

 CFSL sources said its scientists were not aware if the CD they received and the one sent to Hyderabad were the same. Hyderabad laboratory director K.P.C. Gandhi said: ?We had compared the CD from head to toe, including the fingers and toes and the hair line. We found the lady featured in the blue film was not the same appearing in porn CD sent by J amp;K police?. 

 Cops in a spot

 Jammu and Kashmir director-general of police Gopal Sharma has submitted a report to the high court holding three police officials responsible for ?wilfully allowing? the electronic media to interview Anara while she was in custody. 

 The court has asked the DGP for another status report in a week, saying it might have a ?bearing on the question of human rights violation?.

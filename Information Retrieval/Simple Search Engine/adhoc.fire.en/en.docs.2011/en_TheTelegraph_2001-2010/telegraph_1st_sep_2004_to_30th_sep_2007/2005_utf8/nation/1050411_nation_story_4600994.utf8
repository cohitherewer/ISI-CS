 Son kidnapped, J amp;K official quits

 Srinagar (PTI): Suspected militants on Sunday kidnapped the 14-year-old son of the Sopore municipal council chairman in Baramulla district, forcing him to resign immediately.

 ?I announced my resignation in the mosque just a while ago,? said Ghulam Rasool Dar, who was recently elected to the post. ?My son is very dear to me and I will do anything to save him,? Dar said. 

 He said the kidnappers had called him after they abducted his son, Mehrajuddin, outside his residence at Maharajpora in Sopore in the afternoon. 

 They asked him to resign from the council. ?I asked them who they were but they told me to just resign. They also said I will come to know who they are in due course of time,? Dar said.

 A police spokesman said a massive search has been launched to trace Mehrajuddin and apprehend the kidnappers.

 Sugar stick for UP officers

 Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government 

 transferred two senior IAS officers of the sugarcane department 

 on Sunday over a dispute on payment to farmers by private 

 mill owners, reports our special correspondent. 

 The issue has been embarrassing the Mulayam Singh Yadav government ever since Rahul Gandhi mentioned it during his maiden speech in Parliament on March 21. Rahul had said though dues of Rs 517 crore were yet to be paid to the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, the state government had given an affidavit to the court saying no dues remained to be paid to the farmers.

 Also under fire from his ally Rashtriya Lok Dal over the default, Mulayam Singh called a review meeting on Saturday and asked the IAS officers about the steps taken to pressure the private sugar mill owners. 

 Chandra Prakash Mishra, the special secretary of the department, and Chandraprakash, the sugarcane commissioner, reportedly told him that the payment had been the highest this season. If any coercive step was taken, ?some of the private mills would close down?, an officer said. 

 But the chief minister directed chief secretary V.K. Mittal to shift the officers immediately.

 ?My government would not tolerate any lapse on the part of senior officers, specially on issues affecting peasants and poor people of the state,? Mulayam Singh said.

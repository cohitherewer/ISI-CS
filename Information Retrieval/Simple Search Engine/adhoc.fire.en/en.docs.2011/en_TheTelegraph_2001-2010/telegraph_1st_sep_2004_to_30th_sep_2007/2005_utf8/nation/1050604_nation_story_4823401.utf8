 Rahul on way to seat at party high table 

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, June 3: When Sonia Gandhi ran for the post of Congress president, it was a no-contest.

 Now Rahul Gandhi is poised to stand for election to the Congress Working Committee, which is being brought forward for him.

 That he will win an election to the working committee is not in doubt, a top party source said.

 He would probably prefer to enter the partys highest executive body through a contest rather than being nominated as a member by the Congress president. It would lend more weight to his leadership credentials.

 Besides the Congress president, the working committee has 24 members ? 12 in the elected category and 12 in the nominated category. All nominations are made by the party chief.

 Congress leaders have been clamouring for Rahul to emerge from the confines of his Amethi parliamentary constituency and shoulder responsibility as an All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary.

 To do that, he must gain membership of the working committee. Till now, most party members had assumed that Rahul would be nominated to the panel.

 Sonias political managers at the AICC are giving final shape to a plan that features an open contest for the 12 elective category positions in the working committee so that Rahul can enter the fray.

 The plan also envisages an early vote. Usually, elections to the working committee are held during the party plenary, organised as part of the three-yearly Congress organisational polls.

 Party managers think that organising the plenary, however, may not be possible before August-September. They do not want to wait that long to bring Rahul into the working committee.

 They also argue that separating the working committee election from the plenarys agenda would help the plenary concentrate on more serious policy issues.

 The plan, therefore, is to call an early meeting of nearly 1,000 new AICC members ? who constitute the electoral college ? and hold the working committee election.

 AICC general secretary and media department chairperson Ambika Soni, when asked yesterday about convening such a meeting of the AICC, said it cannot be treated as more than a rumour at present.

 She may be right because the plan requires Sonias nod. Sources dropped enough hints that the party managers would approach the Congress president with the plan. They are confident that she will approve.

 The AICC members are, however, yet to be elected. Most state Congress units have authorised Sonia to nominate these members. Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel, Soni and central election authority chairman Oscar Fernandes yesterday held discussions on nomination of AICC members from the states.

 A complete list of AICC members is likely to be ready by the next weekend, setting the stage for convening a meeting to elect new working committee members, with Rahul among them.

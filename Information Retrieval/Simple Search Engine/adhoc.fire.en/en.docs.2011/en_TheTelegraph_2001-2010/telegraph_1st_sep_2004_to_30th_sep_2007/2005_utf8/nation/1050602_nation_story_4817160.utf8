 Uma unites Gaur, Digvijay 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 1: They are poles apart. One is from the BJP and the other from the Congress. One is a Yadav and the other a Rajput. Yet Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur and his predecessor Digvijay Singh shared a platform yesterday and had a whale of a time poking fun at Uma Bharti.

 Gaur was here to consult central BJP leaders, including Arun Jaitley, before expanding his cabinet. Uma, too, met Jaitley to discuss Bihar and to ensure Gaur does not sack her supporters. She complained that Gaur had not invited her for the swearing-in. 

 The chief minister today dropped three ministers, including an Uma loyalist, and inducted six, three of them known to be her detractors.

 Before meeting Jaitley, Gaur shared a platform with Digvijay at the book release of Madhya Pradesh ? Development Challenges, published by Observer Research Foundation, an NGO.

 Gaur teased Digvijay during his speech, saying he was thankful he had handed over Madhya Pradesh on a platter. He said he would invite Digvijay to inaugurate several projects he had begun and left unfinished during his tenure.

 Next, he consoled Digvijay as he was unemployed. 

 Gaur was all praise for the UPA for helping with development projects in the state. 

 Digvijay kept mum all through, but paid Gaur back in his own coin after the function.

 He called journalists and prodded them to ask Gaur questions about Uma amid laughter. Gaur, with mock concern, folded his hands and told Digvijay not to put him in trouble.

 Then Digvijay asked the scribes if they wanted to know the names of people Gaur would drop. He then rattled off four names as Gaur protested in a light-hearted way.

 As reporters furiously took notes, Digvijay said: Now, I will announce the names of the six ministers being inducted. At this, Gaur begged him not to let the cat out of the bag.

 After keeping quiet for a while, Digvijay asked Gaur: Why are you troubling a backward caste mahila?

 Laughing aloud and showing mock fear, Gaur started chanting Hari Om, Hari Om. Then he said he had already drawn a lakshmanrekha (around Uma).

 Rebel policy set for shift

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, April 13: The home ministry is planning a hands-on approach to tackle the Naxalite menace.

 The security establishment is tilting towards a proposal to set up one or more unified commands in affected states and start an all-out operation.

 The unified command being conceived by the home ministry would broadly be on the lines of those already in place in Guwahati and Srinagar. Ministry officials are expected to throw up the idea at the chief ministers? conference on Friday.

 The unified command system would not only help improve coordination but also give those at the helm of the structure an overall view of the situation.

 The Naxalite problem had come up for discussion at the recent army commanders? conference in the capital. There are indications that the GOC, Central Command, might make a presentation on the problem at the chief minister?s conference.

 So long, North Block had settled for a hands-off approach. It was left to the states to deal with the problem, with the central government?s role limited to advising, coordinating or, at best, assisting with resources and manpower. The argument was that if the Centre tried to be pro-active, states ruled by the BJP ? in case of the previous NDA regime, the Congress ? would allege interference in law and order, a state subject.

 However, a recent discussion in Parliament ? where the BJP demanded a unified strategy and promised not to object to pro-active intervention from the Centre ? appears to have emboldened the leadership. The acknowledgement that the Andhra Pradesh experiment to buy peace with the rebels by ignoring violations of the law had failed to resolve the issue also helped the home ministry come up with a firm recommendation.

 Officials said home minister Shivraj Patil is likely to press for a unified strategy at the chief ministers? conclave. The assessment is that NDA-ruled states like Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh are unlikely to take positions prompted by politics, not when they have been among the vocal votaries of central role.

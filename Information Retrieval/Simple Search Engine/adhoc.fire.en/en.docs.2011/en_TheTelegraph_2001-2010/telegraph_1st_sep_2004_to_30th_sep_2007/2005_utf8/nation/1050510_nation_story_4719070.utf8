 Yatra push for jobs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: Left parties and voluntary activists will launch a countrywide campaign this month to mount pressure on the Centre to implement the National Employment Guarantee Act ? one of their key demands.

 They have also accused former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh of delaying the implementation of the law.

 Singh, a BJP leader, heads the parliamentary standing committee on rural development, which is examining the act and the amendments recommended by various parties. Left leaders feel the Centre will not be able to bring the act in this session as Singh is not acting fast enough.

 It is not only the Left that is mounting pressure on the Centre for the speedy implementation of the act that they believe will change the face of rural Bengal. 

 Like-minded organisations have formed a committee for ?peoples action? for employment guarantee. The committee, which includes National Advisory Council members Jean Dreze and Aruna Roy, CPI member Annie Raja and CPM central committee member Suneet Chopra, is going to launch a yatra on May 13 to campaign for the right to employment.

 ?The yatra aims to consolidate a campaign for a full-fledged employment guarantee act,? the panel said. The activists will tour Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. 

 The rural development ministry has identified 150 districts where the scheme is being implemented on a pilot basis. The Left had been unhappy with the act and had pressed the Centre to send it to a standing committee. They wanted the law tightened. 

 Dreze, a campaigner, said the loopholes in the law would help the government wriggle out of its commitment.

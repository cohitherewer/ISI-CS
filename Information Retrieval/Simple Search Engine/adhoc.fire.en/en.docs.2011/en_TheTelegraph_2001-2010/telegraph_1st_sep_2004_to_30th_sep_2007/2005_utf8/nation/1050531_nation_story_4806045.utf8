 Badal picks fight with Amarinder over Bluestar

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Badal: Protest pitch

 Chandigarh May 30: Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal today defended the decision of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) to build a memorial to those who died in the Golden Temple during Operation Bluestar in 1984 and assailed Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singhs opposition to the move.

 The SGPC and the Shiromani Akali Dal would observe June 6 as a black day for the community with prayers and meetings in the Golden Temple complex. Leaders from the Sikh seminary, Damdami Taksal, which militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale headed, would also be present on the occasion.

 While the Akal Takht, the highest temporal body of the Sikhs, declared Bhindranwale martyr last year, the Taksal said last week that he had fallen to the armys bullets at 8.45 am on June 6, 1984. The Taksal had earlier refused to acknowledge that Bhindranwale was dead.

 Badal said Amarinders statement could be the result of pressure from Congress leaders who still justified the army action that razed the Akal Takht and caused considerable damage to the Golden Temple.

 How can Amarinder forget the timing of the army action, when hundreds of devotees were present inside the complex and died in the assault? Badal asked. Amarinder still wines and dines with those responsible for crimes against Sikhs and his statement flows from his personal equations with those behind Operation Bluestar and the massacre of Sikhs that followed Indira Gandhis death.

 The Akali chief also wondered about the real motive behind Amarinder starting a controversy on an internal issue of the community when people were fed up with the Congress government in Punjab.

 It is strange that the man who had resigned from the Congress against the army action and described it as a major holocaust, should now openly oppose the Sikh communitys proposal to raise a religious memorial to that event, Badal said.

 He said the Sikh community pays homage to the martyrs of June 1984 every year at the Akal Takht. It is only the Congress party that injects an element of bitterness in the atmosphere by opposing every move of the community to uphold its pride and heritage, Badal said.

 It seems Amarinder has raked up this controversy to deflect the peoples attention from his disastrous pleasure trip to Canada from which he has come totally empty-handed. Punjab is reeling under unspeakable crises on every front, be it power, roads, employment, agriculture, industry or Dalits. The chief ministers remarks on an issue that has nothing to do with governance could be his way of trying to turn the peoples attention away from their daily misery at the hands of his anti-people and non-performing government, the Akali chief said.

 Badal said he had been taken aback by Amarinders description of the proposed memorial as a retrograde step. Does Amarinder want us to forget history? he asked. Punjabis were forward-looking people, he added, but it does not mean that they should abandon their history or heritage.

 Badal said the Shiromani Akali Dal was alive to its obligations as a responsible political party committed to peace,. But it was the Congress that had always plotted conspiracies to drive a wedge between communities in the state.

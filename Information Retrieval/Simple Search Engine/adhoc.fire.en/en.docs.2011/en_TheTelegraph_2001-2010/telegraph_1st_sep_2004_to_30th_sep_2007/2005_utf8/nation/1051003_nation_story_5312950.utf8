 Eye in sky to sort out bandit isle dispute

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Oct. 2: A year ago, it was Veerappan territory ? and the governments of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka wouldnt have dreamt of setting foot on it.

 Now, with the terror of the jungles dead, both states want the river island. 

 And only help from above ? that is, from the Indian Remote Sensing satellite ? might settle the row.

 Located midstream of the Cauvery about 180 km from here, the 400-acre island, which offers a stunning view of the Hogennakal waterfalls, has already turned into a tourist attraction.

 For two decades, no one had tried to approach it, either from the Tamil Nadu side (via Dharmapuri) or the Karnataka side (via Chamarajnagar). But the brigands death on October 18, 2004, followed by a good monsoon this year, has sparked an invasion of picnickers from both states.

 The flood of tourists caught the eye of Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation officials. 

 Last month, they started to build shelters for the tourists only to come up against furious objections from Karnataka forest officials.

 According to Survey of India documents, the island belongs to both states. The two governments, however, have lodged complaints with the Centre and are making no effort to talk with each other.

 So, the eye in the sky seems the only hope. 

 Satellite images of the island along with cadastral maps (depicting land and water with details of the terrain, etc) can help the Centre prevent fresh dispute between the states.

 Our colleagues will come over from Delhi soon to take a look at the island and draw the boundary according to satellite images and maps, a Survey of India official said.

 According to Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) sources, government agencies can access satellite images of any part of the country at the National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), Hyderabad. 

 A study of the maps and satellite images will give a true picture of the region, a source said.

 Chief minister Dharam Singh has vowed: We will not allow Tamil Nadu to take one inch of our land. If there is an encroachment, this government will not keep quiet.

 His Tamil Nadu counterpart, Jayalalithaa, has accused Karnataka of making an unnecessary issue of an island that always belonged to her state. 

 Both states have posted policemen on the island to prevent the other encroaching. 

 When Veerappan was alive, the states had accused each other of being soft on the bandit. Now the brigand has got them fighting again from beyond his grave.

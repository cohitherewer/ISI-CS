 Jaitley and Mahajan get Assam poll charge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 28: BJP general secretaries Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley were today given the charge of the Assam Assembly elections scheduled for May 2006. 

 The decision was taken at a meeting of the BJP?s parliamentary board ? the party?s apex decision-making body ? chaired by president L.K. Advani and attended by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 The choice of Mahajan and Jaitley ? regarded as the BJP?s sharp-shooters after they delivered ?difficult? states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar ? indicated that in the next slew of Assembly elections, Assam is the most crucial for the party. 

 In the others ? Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Bengal ? the party has a negligible presence. 

 Although the BJP did not fare well in Assam in the last elections, sources said if an alliance was ?properly cemented? with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and if it played up the ?indigenous people? versus ?illegal? immigrants issue, it could put up a ?good? fight against the Congress. 

 The AGP, which split five years ago, has been reunited with Prafulla Mahanta?s adversaries Brighu Phukan and Brindabon Goswami returning to the fold. 

 The reunited AGP was what the BJP was waiting for before sending feelers for an alliance.

 IMA on ?token? protest path

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 6: The 72-hour ?ultimatum? for the rescue of abducted doctor U.K. Raja having expired, the Bihar unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) will stage a token dharna tomorrow and called a statewide strike the day after.

 ?We would like to draw the attention of the government to our demands through the two-hour sit-in tomorrow. We would follow it up with a strike on Saturday,? said state IMA president Vijay Shankar Singh. The strike will not affect emergency medical services, the association declared. 

 The IMA working committee meeting today dwelled at length on the effect the strike would have on patients across the state. 

 ?We don?t want to cause more problems for humanity at a time when millions are suffering due to the tsunami. At the same time, we want to tell the government that we are deeply saddened by its failure to rescue our brother, Raja,? Singh said.

 The IMA justified the strike and the token dharna on the grounds that it ?needs to apply pressure on the government?.

 The association also accused the police of Purnea and Madhepura of ?slackening? their efforts to rescue the doctor. ?The police appeared very active initially but now they seem to be dilly-dallying for reasons unknown to us,? Singh argued.

 ?Three days after the strike on January 8, we will meet again to review the situation. We shall then decide on our course of action,? he added.

 Doctors of Kosi and Purnea divisions have struck work for three days, affecting health services in the districts of Madhepura, Purnea, Saharsa, Supaul and Khagaria. 

 Purnea police, which yesterday claimed that they have identified the gang, today said intense raids are on to nab the culprits. 

 Deputy superintendent of police Ashok Kumar Prasad said he has detained three men, who were moving suspiciously on a motorcycle, for interrogation.

 State IMA chief Singh said, ?We are yet to get the promised compensation of Rs 20 lakh for slain doctor N.K. Agrawal, but are happy that the police took the culprits to task,? he said. 

 Singh further said there has been a decrease in the number of ransom calls after the murder of Agrawal.

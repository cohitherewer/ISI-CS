 Singh: Pacifying opponents

 New Delhi, Dec 19: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met leaders of Other Backward Classes last night to neutralise their opposition to the constitution amendment bill providing for reservation in private unaided educational institutions.

 The OBC leaders wanted the bill, which mentions only Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and educationally and socially backward classes, to make a specific reference to OBC students.

 Prominent among those who attended the meeting were Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad. Human resource development minister Arjun Singh was also present.

 According to HRD ministry officials, the Prime Minister persuaded the OBC leaders to agree to pass the bill in its present form. Its introduction was deferred last week following criticism from BJP and OBC leaders who said the bill exempted minority institutions and did not specifically use the word OBC.

 The bill is slated for introduction tomorrow.

 Last night, the Prime Minister explained to the leaders that the reference to educationally and socially backward classes in the bill included OBCs, said an official.

 The OBC leaders might have been pacified, but the battle is not over yet for the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre.

 The NDA today said it would oppose the bill. The announcement was made after BJP spokesperson V.K. Malhotra met NDA leaders this afternoon.

 The NDA has unanimously agreed that the clause in the bill exempting minority institutions from its purview has to be dropped, Malhotra said, adding that the alliance would move amendments to the bill tomorrow.

 If the Centre manages to pass the bill, it will open the floodgates to reservations not only in private unaided higher educational institutions but also schools. The bill says a state would be free to introduce a law relating to admission for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes and SC/STs.

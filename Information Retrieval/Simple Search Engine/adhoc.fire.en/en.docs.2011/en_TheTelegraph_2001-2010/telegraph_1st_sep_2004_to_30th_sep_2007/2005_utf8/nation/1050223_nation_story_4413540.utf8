 Heat on India in UK chilli powder scare

 AMIT ROY 

 London, Feb. 22: Three rogue exporters from Mumbai ? there could be more ? have given India a bad name by despatching to Britain a consignment of red chilli powder contaminated with a dye called Sudan I that could cause cancer.

 The three exporters were named today by the UK authorities after the country?s largest food recall was initiated in the wake of the discovery of traces of Sudan I in Worcester sauce in which the chilli powder was used.

 Under orders from the regulating body, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), some 300 companies have withdrawn at least 418 items, ranging from crisps to noodles and McDonald?s dressing, from supermarket shelves.

 The recall is a precautionary measure. Dr Jon Bell, chief executive of the FSA, said: ?Sudan I could contribute to an increased risk of cancer. However, at the levels present, the risk is likely to be very small but it is sensible to avoid eating any more. There is no risk of immediate ill-health.? 

 Although there is no evidence that Sudan I, a red dye that might have been used to put extra shine on the chilli powder, is dangerous to human health, animal tests suggest it is a potent carcinogen.

 ?It?s harmful, no doubt, but to get cancer you have to swallow two kilos of chilli at a time,? said an Indian food supplier.

 Nonetheless, the panic has sparked a chorus for the Spices Board of India to take firm action to ensure exported chillies or chilli powder do not contain the dye. Fakhruddin Suterwalla, a director of TR Suterwalla and Sons, a big spice importer in Britain, said: ?India is now the biggest chilli exporter and needs to protect its reputation.?

 In Delhi, the first reaction was to go into denial. Commerce minister Kamal Nath asserted that in 2003, the board imposed stringent norms for colouring agents.

 ?No exports from India have carcinogenic substances,? he added.

 ?Some vested interests are spreading these charges. We have complied with the standards sought by a European team and imported machine dusters to adhere to the strict norms of European buyers,? a board official was quoted by PTI as saying.

 While these claims may be true, the consignment causing the scare might have been imported in 2002. Since July 2003, all chilli powder imported into the UK has to be certified free from Sudan I.

 The problem was first reported on February 7 by Premier Foods, the makers of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce, which in turn was informed of the contamination after tests conducted in Italy. The products that are now being recalled contain the Worcester sauce made by Premier using the contaminated chilli powder.

 Sudan I is used for colouring solvents, oils, waxes, petrol, and shoe and floor polishes.

 The three exporters who put Sudan I in chilli powder were identified as: Gautam Export Corporation, Flat 11-B, 3rd Floor, Koolbreeze CHS Ltd., Plot No K-72, 17th Road, Khar (West), Mumbai 400052; Patons Export Pvt Ltd, 10, Koolbreeze CHS Ltd., 17th Road, Khar (West), Mumbai 400052; and Volga Spices amp; Masala Mills (P) Ltd, 10-A, Tata Mill Compound Near Elphinston Bridge, Parel, Mumbai 400012. 

 The Indian spices board has promised to punish the guilty companies by stripping them of their certificates of registration as exporter of spices. Action has also been threatened to remove their certificate of registration but it is not known if this follow-up action has been taken. 

 Companies face serious sanctions for selling food known to be contaminated. At magistrates? court, the maximum penalties are a ?20,000 fine and six months in jail. At crown court, the maximum penalties are two years? jail and an unlimited fine.

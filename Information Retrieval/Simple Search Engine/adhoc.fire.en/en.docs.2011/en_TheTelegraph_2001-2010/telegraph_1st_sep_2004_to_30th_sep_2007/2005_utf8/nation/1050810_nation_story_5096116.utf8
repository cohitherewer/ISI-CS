 Lions to drive out dacoits

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Kanpur, Aug. 9: Where police guns failed, will the roar of lions help?

 The Uttar Pradesh government desperately hopes so.

 Outsmarted by robber gangs that have so long had a free run of the states wooded ravines, the government is thinking of letting loose lions to flush out the bandits from their forest hideouts.

 The existing animals never posed any threat to the dacoits, lions will, said a forest officer.

 In a project report submitted to the Central Zoo Authority this week, the state government has suggested a lion safari park in Etawah, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs dacoit-infested home district, on 150 hectares of forest land.

 The project is set to cost us Rs 5.6 crore. We are waiting for clearance from the zoo authority, chief wildlife warden Mohammad Ehsan said.

 Once developed, the area would turn out to be a wildlife lovers paradise, said K.K. Singh, divisional forest officer of Etawah.

 It would be on the model of the Lions Safari of Africa already emulated in a project in Hyderabad, added B.K. Sharma, secretary in the governments forest department.

 The forest department initially plans to let loose five lions. Later it hopes to increase the number to at least 25 by developing the forest prey base.

 We believe the challenge involved in putting an end to the dacoit menace is almost similar to the one in ending the Naxalite problem. The police alone can do precious little, said Etawah superintendent of police S.K. Chaudhary.

 About 25 dacoit gangs are active in the ravines that border two states ? Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Of these, 13 operate in both states, using the easy escape routes in the inaccessible forest ranges.

 Among the gangs, most feared are the Mewaran, Shankar Kewat and Kallu Yadav gangs. But the bandit king is still Nirbhay Gujjar, who controls large parts of the ravines. The Gujjar gang lost five key members in a police encounter last month. It led to speculation over his surrender.

 The 55-year-old, however, told reporters in Etawah over phone today that he had no plans to surrender as yet. I will better live the rest of my life in the forest, he said.

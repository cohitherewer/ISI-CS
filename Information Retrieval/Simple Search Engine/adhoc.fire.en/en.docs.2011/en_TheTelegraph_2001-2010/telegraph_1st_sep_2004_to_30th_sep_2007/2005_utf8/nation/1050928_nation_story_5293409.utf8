 Sarabjit gets death again

 IMTIAZ GUL AND GAJINDER SINGH

 Islamabad/Chandigarh, Sept. 27: The Pakistan Supreme Court today upheld Sarabjit Singhs death sentence in another blast case in Lahore in 1990, amid uproar in India to release him.

 On August 18, the court upheld the death sentence against him in three other cases. 

 A two-member bench today dismissed an appeal by Sarabjits lawyer Rana Abdul Hamid in the fourth bomb blast case, saying the plea came after the mandatory period of 60 days. The blast took place at Lahores Yakki Gate in July 1990. 

 The case was dismissed on the grounds that it was timed out and on grounds of merits, Hamid said. He would file a review petition in the same court tomorrow.

 The court found Sarabjit guilty of carrying out the bomb blast in Lahore and killing innocent civilians as an agent of Indias Research and Analysis Wing.

 The judgment comes weeks after Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that he would go into legal aspects of the case before taking a decision on a mercy plea.

 The August verdict prompted widespread protests in India with Sarabjits sister Dalbir Kaur spearheading a campaign for his pardon and release. His family claimed that he had strayed accidentally into Pakistan and was arrested.

 Dalbir said at their home in Bhikhiwind today: We have full faith in the Pakistan President. It is he and only he who can stop an innocent person from being hanged.

 I will also meet foreign minister Natwar Singh and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to plead with Musharraf and Pakistan Punjab chief minister Pervez Elahi. 

 Sarabjits lawyer said he could also petition Musharraf for clemency or commutation of the death sentence into life imprisonment.

 Another convict

 The family of another Indian on death row in Pakistan, Kirpal Singh, has threatened to commit suicide. His sister Jangir said Kirpal, like Sarabjit, had entered Pakistan in a drunken state in 1991.

 We came to know about him in 1994 when we received his letter from Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore. He said he had crossed into Pakistani territory from Mustafa village in Gurdaspur and had been prosecuted for some bomb explosions, she said.

 We will kill ourselves if he is not released, Jangir said.

 Sarabjits family, too, has threatened suicide if he is not released.

 A relative said Kirpal had started drinking after his father-in-law and wife got him arrested in a dispute.

 Airbase gate blast

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Dec. 23: Militants exploded a car bomb at the entrance of Srinagars high-security air force base this morning, having duped the driver of a hired car into playing suicide attacker.

 The militants loaded the Tata Sumo with explosives, hidden in boxes of apples, but never got on the car themselves. Driver Kishan Singh, told to collect his passengers from the airbase at Rangreth, drove to the spot.

 The driver escaped the blast, which destroyed the vehicle and could be heard 5 km away, as he had got off the car for a security check just seconds earlier.

 No one else was injured either, with a senior army officer thanking the fool-proof security in the area. The driver has been taken in for questioning, a senior police officer said.

 Kishan Singh told the police that a person had hired the car at Lal Chowk and told him that his passengers were waiting for him at uptown Rawalpora. 

 When Singh reached Rawalpora, another man told him the passengers were at the airbase. He loaded two boxes into the car, telling Singh they contained apples.

 Airports, civil and military, have been a prime target for militants, but this was the first attack on the heavily fortified air force base. In 2001, militants had tried to storm the civil airport, killing 12 people. 

 Militants also launched an attack in north Kashmirs Sopore yesterday. The gun battle continued today, killing a BSF trooper.

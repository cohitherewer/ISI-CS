 Rabri luxury at rival mercy

 Patna, Nov. 23: By itself, 1 Anne Marg, which has been Rabri Devis home while she was chief minister, is large enough.

 Considered together with the adjoining and interconnected 5 Desh Ratna Marg ? official residence of husband Lalu Prasad in his capacity of former chief minister ? its one huge, sprawling compound.

 The former rulers of Bihar, with their nine children and a host of relatives, possibly needed the space to lead a comfortable life. Their two sons, very fond of cricket, would do their nets on the lawn.

 Chief minister-designate Nitish Kumar, known for his simpler lifestyle, probably does not need such a huge house or compound. But the question being asked across the state capital is: Will the new chief minister ask his predecessor to vacate 1 Anne Marg?

 Technically, Rabri Devis home was not designated as the official residence of the Bihar chief minister. She is within her rights to stay on at the address because, according to the rules, every former chief minister who has completed a full five-year term can continue to occupy an official bungalow and enjoy certain other privileges, such as personal security.

 Nitish has repeatedly said that as chief minister, he would not try to settle scores with political opponents. This should give Rabri Devi hope that she would not have to vacate 1 Anne Marg.

 But a senior IAS officer said: Providing security to a chief minister is serious business and our understanding is that 1 Anne Marg is perhaps the bungalow best suited from that point of view. We do not even need to alter the present legal position to get 1 Anne Marg vacated. Rabri Devi can be easily allotted another suitable house.

 The official said crucial additions have been made to 1 Anne Marg ? including an outhouse, a small swimming pool and a swanky conference hall ? under Lalu Prasads guidance. 

 These additions suit a chief ministers bungalow well. If the new chief minister decides to move into this house, a good amount of money can be saved, the official argued.

 The bungalow is located next to Raj Bhavan, whose present occupant, Buta Singh, was recently forced by the Supreme Court to vacate government accommodation that he had continued to occupy in New Delhi.

 But Lalu Prasad and his family are emotionally attached to their home of 15 years. The railway minister has built cowsheds at 5 Desh Ratna Marg and is said to be extremely fond of the outhouse ? his real, well-stocked living quarters.

 One of his orderlies said: Sahib likes to talk to the people either on the verandah or under the big tree outside. We have also become very used to this house. I pray we are not asked to vacate this bungalow.

 Rabri Devi had a scare in March when the administration ordered her brothers Sadhu Yadav and Subhash Yadav to vacate their MLAs bungalows, which they had continued to occupy after becoming MPs. At that time, with Bihar under Presidents rule, there were strong rumours that she might have to shift from 1 Anne Marg.

 Her luck held on that occasion. Whether it will a second time depends solely on Nitish.

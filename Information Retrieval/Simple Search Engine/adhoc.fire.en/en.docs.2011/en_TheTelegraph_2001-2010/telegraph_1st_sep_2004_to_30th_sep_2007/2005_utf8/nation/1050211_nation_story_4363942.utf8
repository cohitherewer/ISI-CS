 CBI ready to trail gutka barons

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: The CBI will soon set out on the trail of Rasiklal Dhariwal and Jagdish Joshi, who are already on the Interpol radar, now that it has taken over investigations into the case linking the gutka barons to the underworld.

 The bureau today sent a four-member team to Mumbai after registering a case against four persons accused of extortion and smuggling machinery to set up a gutka factory in Pakistan.

 The bureau?s FIR names Anees Ibrahim, brother of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, Zamurrudin Ansari, Raghubhai Panchariya and Mohammad Farooq Mansuri.

 Dhariwal of the Manickchand group and Joshi of Goa gutka do not figure in the FIR but bureau officials suggest it is only a matter of time before they do.

 ?Interpol has already issued a red-corner notice against Joshi and Dhariwal on a request forwarded by the bureau on January 17... That notice is still valid,? a CBI officer said.

 They are wanted for extortion and organised crime after Ansari and Raghubhai claimed that the gutka barons approached Anees to settle a dispute of Rs 40 crore between them and helped the gangster set up a gutka factory.

 Dhariwal and Joshi, both NRIs, have denied the allegation. Dhariwal had offered to be questioned through the video-conferencing facility.

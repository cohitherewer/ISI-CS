 Jogi jockeys, Vora in wings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: The buzz about a possible cabinet reshuffle has breathed life into a few skeletons in the Congress cupboard.

 The most prominent among them is former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, who has been in the doghouse ever since the Dilip Singh Judeo cash-on-video scandal boomeranged on him during the November 2003 Assembly elections.

 Jogi has been parading MLAs and other supporters from the state. He laid out a lavish luncheon for journalists and party workers this afternoon. The theme was bring Jogi back, as the 13 legislators from Chhattisgarh spelt out for the benefit of the media team.

 Jogiji is the only elected (Congress) MP from this state. If popularity is any criterion, then Jogiji is the only eligible candidate from the state, an MLA said.

 The emphasis on elected MP is, Congress sources say, an attempt to weaken the chances of rivals in the race for a cabinet berth. The person directly in the line of fire is veteran Mohsina Kidwai, a Rajya Sabha MP from the state. Mohsinas supporters have built her case on the twin props of her being a woman and a minority candidate.

 Party treasurer Motilal Vora is another hopeful from the state. Vora has lost as many as nine elections. How can he represent the people? an MLA said.

 Vora says he lost just one election and isnt lobbying for a cabinet berth anyway.

 Senior party leaders feel Jogis current campaign may land him in deeper trouble. But the former chief minister, in the words of his supporters, is undaunted.

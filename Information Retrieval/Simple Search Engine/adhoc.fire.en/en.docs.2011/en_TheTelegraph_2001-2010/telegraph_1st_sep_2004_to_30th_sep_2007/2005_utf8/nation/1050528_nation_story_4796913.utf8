 CPM nominee for women panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 27: The CPM has got Sonia Gandhis nod for the induction of Malini Bhattacharya into the National Commission for Women (NCW), elbowing out CPI candidate Meenakshi Thampan.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and his colleague Sitaram Yechury had recently met the Congress president to canvass for their party member.

 The fact that the CPM put forward a request for Bhattacharya indicates that she is back in the partys good books. Till sometime ago, the ex-MP was considered a dissident.

 A former professor of Jadavpur University, Bhattacharya was a member of the Lok Sabha between 1991 and 1995. She, however, lost the Jadavpur seat in the next general elections.

 Sources said Karat and Yechury proposed Bhattacharyas name to Sonia, who agreed, leaving the CPI in the cold. The party had been lobbying for Thampan, an activist of the National Federation of Indian Women, the CPIs womens organisation.

 The NCW has five new members, most of whom are known Congress loyalists.

 During the NDA regime, the Left parties had blasted Poornima Advani, the then NCW chairperson, for being a Murli Manohar Joshi appointee. Advani later gave the Narendra Modi government a clean chit in the NCWs report on the Gujarat riots.

 The commission is now headed by Congress leader Girija Vyas, who lost the last Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan where the party also lost power in the Assembly.

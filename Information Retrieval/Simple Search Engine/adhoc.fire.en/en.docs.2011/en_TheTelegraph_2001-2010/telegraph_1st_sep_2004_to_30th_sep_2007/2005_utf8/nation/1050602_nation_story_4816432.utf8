 Fire in Patna, truce whiff in Delhi

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Patna, June 1: Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan kept firing verbal volleys at each other in Patna but outlines of a truce seemed to be taking shape in Delhi today.

 Congress sources said the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief met Sonia Gandhi to hold exploratory alliance talks and gave a clear indication that he wanted Paswan on board.

 The Lok Janshakti Party president, who had yesterday declared theres no UPA in Bihar, also seems willing to negotiate with Laloo Prasad through Sonia for a secular alliance for the Bihar Assembly polls, likely to be held in October-November. 

 Sonia, who has admitted the Congress made mistakes in the last round of elections, has herself taken the initiative to bring her warring Bihar allies together well in time for the next battle.

 To that extent, the battle between Laloo Prasad and Paswan could now be fought over their share of seats, Congress sources said. 

 The RJD chief tried to impress upon Sonia that the Lok Janshakti Party is no longer as strong a force as its performance in the February elections would suggest. 

 After the recent desertions from his party, it would be unrealistic for Paswan to expect more than three dozen of the 243 seats at stake.

 Paswan, however, has apparently indicated he is willing to soften his anti-Laloo Prasad stance and will leave it to Sonia to decide the role his party would play in the next round of elections.

 Laloo Prasad asked Sonia to keep kerosene and diesel out of the looming fuel price hike in the run-up to the polls. The railway minister is also understood to have met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to suggest that the hike in the price of petrol be kept at a minimum.

 Back in Bihar, the RJD chief, however, thundered that he would have nothing to do with a defunct Lok Janshakti Party in the upcoming elections.

 After the recent revolt of its MLAs, the LJP has become a party of non-entities, Laloo Prasad said. It has neither leaders nor supporters. I am ready to concede more seats to the Congress, CPI and CPM but I shall have no relations with the LJP.

 The CPI, however, has ruled out any alliance with Laloo Prasads party, apparently because of the raw deal it was given in the previous Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.

 Paswan had said yesterday his party is ready for an alliance with the Congress but he would not show his cards on a secular alliance till the last moment. He said: If necessary, we will go it alone in the elections.

 The Lok Janshakti Party chief is now focusing on holding on to his Muslim voters, who had abandoned the RJD and voted for him in February.

 Laloo Prasad had turned down Paswans latest proposal to have Muslim RJD leader Jabir Hussain, the partys Legislative Council chairman, as chief minister.

 Varun gets a break

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Varun: Gandhi brigade

 Bhopal, Nov. 30: Varun Gandhi looks set to make his debut in Parliament. The son of Sanjay and Maneka Gandhi is likely to be fielded from Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh, which will fall vacant with sitting MP Shivraj Singh Chauhan being made chief minister.

 Most state BJP leaders are convinced that Varuns entry into the Lok Sabha could serve as a counter to Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. Varun, a member of the BJP national executive, had travelled across the country to campaign during the 2004 general election.

 Sources said Varuns candidature has the backing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief K.S. Sudarshan.

 The news, however, made little difference to the surcharged political atmosphere in Bhopal, where BJP leaders, including former chief minister Babulal Gaur, called for Uma Bhartis expulsion.

 Uma was a lot more subdued compared with Tuesday, when she had claimed she alone represented the real BJP. 

 Today, she said she was smaller than an ordinary BJP worker, declared she would live and die for the party and described the Sangh, A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani as father figures.

 The climbdown is her last-ditch effort to prevent expulsion. Sources close to her confirmed that some well-meaning persons were mediating to prevent her exit. Uma, who has three days to reply to a show-cause notice, will have to call off the Ram, roti yatra to avoid expulsion.

 In her speeches, she has avoided attacking the party leadership directly. On the other hand, the sources said, she is under pressure from Govindacharya to cut off her ties with the BJP and embark on a national awakening programme.

 Govindacharya, a former BJP ideologue, has been holding seminars opposing globalisation and economic reforms. His movement, however, lacks mass support, which Uma is expected to provide through her charisma and oratory. Uma is thus torn between two options.

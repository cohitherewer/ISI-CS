The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Soccer scores with television crores 

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcutta, June 9: After cricket, its time for Indian football to make big money over telecast rights.

 The contract for beaming 10 years of top-level Indian soccer has drawn bids from five production companies and channels, with the highest bid by Nimbus Sport at Rs 504 crore.

 Other than Nimbus, the companies that have expressed interest are Zee Sports, ESPN-STAR Sports, Leisure Sports Management (LSM) and NDTV.

 We have placed a bid for Rs 504 crore, confirmed Harish Thawani, chairman, Nimbus Sport. Zee Sports and ESPN-STAR officials acknowledged they had submitted tenders but wouldnt reveal the amounts promised or other conditions stated.

 We have put in a bid but cannot comment on the figure, said Himanshu Mody, executive vice-president of Zee Sports, which was officially launched today. 

 According to sources, Zees bid is worth around Rs 360 crore. Market sources also said that ESPN-STAR has not committed a particular amount, but offered to work on a revenue-sharing basis with the All India Football Federation and explore the marketing options together.

 LSM, too, did not put a figure to its football foray. We have offered to meet the tournament expenses and development costs, said S.S. Dasgupta, chairman and managing director of the company.

 We have also sought clarifications from the federation on some areas since we were unable to assess the marketability of the content.

 The federations executive committee met in New Delhi yesterday to discuss various issues, including telecast rights for 2005-2015. 

 A two-member evaluation committee will submit its opinion to the main committee of president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, senior vice-president Praful Patel and treasurer Shivanand Salgaokar, said federation general secretary Alberto Colaco. The whole process should be finished by July 15.

 Analysts, however, feel that Nimbuss offer is a bloated one. A more realistic figure would be around Rs 160 crore, said an industry observer. Nimbus had unsuccessfully bid for the cricket telecast rights at various stages.

 While Zee Sports, ESPN-STAR and NDTV possess both production and telecast facilities, Nimbus can only produce the feed while LSM has to look for a production partner.

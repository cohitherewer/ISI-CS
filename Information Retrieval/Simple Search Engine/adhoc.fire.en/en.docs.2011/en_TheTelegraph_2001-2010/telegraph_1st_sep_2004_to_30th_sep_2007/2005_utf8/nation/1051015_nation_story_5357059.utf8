 Escape buzz

 Tawda, Oct. 14: When an NGO brought relief to Tawda in Uri, Muhammad Yusuf Awan, 70, kept watching from a distance, without interest.

 I dont need any relief. I just want to leave this place with my three-year-old grandson, he said. Awan is not alone in planning to migrate. Baba, dont weep, said Perveza Begum, 20, his neighbour who has lost her husband. I, too, have lost everything. I will go with you and look after you.

 In neighbouring Saidapora, Nusrat, 14, explained the fears of the victims. The rice and blanket that we have received will last for some time; but will my brothers be able to get education here? What will happen to them? she asked.

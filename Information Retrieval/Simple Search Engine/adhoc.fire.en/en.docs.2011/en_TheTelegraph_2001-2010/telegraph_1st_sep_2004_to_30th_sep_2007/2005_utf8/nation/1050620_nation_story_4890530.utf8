 Trade focus in Dhaka talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 19: India and Bangladesh will begin two-day foreign secretary level talks here tomorrow in what appears to be a serious attempt to remove the strain on bilateral ties.

 The foreign office consultations will be taking place after two years. The last such meeting was in Dhaka in April 2003.

 Former foreign secretary Shashank had gone to Dhaka on a goodwill visit in March last year but tomorrows meeting would be the first formal interaction between present foreign secretary Shyam Saran and his Bangladeshi counterpart Hemayatuddin.

 The two would get an opportunity not only to review the entire gamut of the bilateral relations but also focus on the stumbling blocks that have stood in the way.

 Sarans meeting with Hemayatuddin comes at a time when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has given clear indications that Delhi is willing to go out of its way to strengthen ties with Dhaka.

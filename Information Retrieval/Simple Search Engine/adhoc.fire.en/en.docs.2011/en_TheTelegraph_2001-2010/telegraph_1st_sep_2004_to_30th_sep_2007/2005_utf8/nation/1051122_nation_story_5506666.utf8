 Vienna music after Tehran tango 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: The ruling alliance and the Left were able to present a united front on Iran today after the government pledged to try and keep the prickly issue within the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

 Hours after the Centre made the promise, diplomats in Vienna said the West has suspended its bid to refer Iran to the Security Council for sanctions.

 Russia is now expected to pursue a compromise plan, which has been backed by India in one of the first decisions Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took after he assumed charge of the external affairs portfolio when Natwar Singh resigned.

 The confidence with which the Centre headed to the meeting with the Left this morning and the late-evening announcement in Vienna suggest that the government was aware that a breakthrough was imminent.

 The government has expressed its intention to make all the necessary diplomatic efforts to keep the Iran issue within the confines of the IAEA. The Left holds the same view, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury had told reporters after a United Progressive Alliance-Left coordination committee meeting.

 The patch-up came three days before a crucial IAEA meeting in Vienna, which was scheduled to decide whether Tehran should be referred to the Security Council. The referral is now expected to be shelved.

 India had voted against Iran at the previous IAEA meeting in September, backing a US-sponsored resolution that envisaged sending the matter to the Security Council at some unspecified date. A furious Left had launched a month-long campaign against the Centre, mounting pressure on it to change its stand at the November 24 meeting.

 After todays discussions, finance minister P. Chidambaram said: (The) government informed the Left parties of the progress made through diplomatic efforts. It was noted that the governments intention was to ensure that the matter remains within the jurisdiction of the IAEA.

 The coordination committee meeting, chaired by the Prime Minister and held two days before Parliaments winter session begins, was a picture of camaraderie and cooperation though it tackled several thorny issues.

 Iran apart, the agenda included the controversial pension bill and the divestment of profit-making, non-navratna PSUs ? both of which had caused disagreement between the government and its key ally. 

 The Left, however, was conciliatory on all of them today. Both sides were keen to avoid a confrontation on the eve of the winter session, where the BJP will look to nail the government on the Volcker report.

 The Left expects trouble also on Bihar. If Laloo Prasad Yadav loses the election, the Opposition National Democratic Alliance will get a boost. 

 Add to that the pending Supreme Court judgment on the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly, and the odds are stacked against the Centre.

 The Left, which is supporting the government to keep the BJP out, does not want to make the situation messier for the ruling alliance. Its leaders came out of the meeting declaring themselves satisfied with the Centres efforts on several fronts, including the Iraq oil-for-food probe and Iran.

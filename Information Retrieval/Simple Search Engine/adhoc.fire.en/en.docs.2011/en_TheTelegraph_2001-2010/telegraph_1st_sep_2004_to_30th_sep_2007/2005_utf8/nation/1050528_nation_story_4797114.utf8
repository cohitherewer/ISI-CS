 Hurriyat trip in PM hands

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, May 27: The Prime Ministers intervention seems to be the only hope for the All Parties Hurriyat Conference leaders planning to take the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus on June 2.

 A five-member delegation of the Hurriyats moderate faction, led by Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, has been invited to travel to Islamabad and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir for talks on Kashmir with the Pakistan government.

 But India has made it clear that any attempt to go beyond Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Baltistan or Gilgit will be seen as a breach of understanding between the neighbours on passengers of the bus.

 The proposed trip is fast turning into yet another topic of debate between Delhi and Islamabad. President Pervez Musharraf had said in a recent interview to a Pakistani newspaper that Singh had given permission to the Hurriyat team to travel to Islamabad.

 South Block officials said the separatist leaders have never been barred from going to Pakistan but to ride the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus, they would have to follow the rules ? applications must be made as individuals as there is no provision for bookings for a large delegation.

 The leaders have been asking for application forms in bulk so that they can take their supporters along. 

 The capacity of the bus is 20-odd. How can they expect to travel with their supporters? a senior official in the foreign ministry asked.

 The foreign ministry has not received any instruction from Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs office, so far, to waive the normal procedure of travel applications for the Hurriyat team.

 Ministry officials pointed out that the bus aims to bring divided Kashmiri families closer. Top priority for travelling on the bus is given to those from divided families, an official said.

 A flag meeting between Indian and Pakistani officials will take place tomorrow at the designated spot on the Line of Control to hand over applications of passengers whose names have been cleared.

 Sources said an application normally takes about two weeks to be cleared. If the leaders apply now ? but as individuals ? they may be able to get seats on the bus scheduled for June 16.

 However, the application nitty-gritties apart, the controversy is believed to have stemmed from Islamabads attempt to give the Hurriyat the honour of being the sole representatives of the Kashmiri people. 

 India has made it clear that it does not mind holding talks with the separatists if they condemn violence, but it refuses to recognise the Hurriyat, which has not contested elections in the Valley so far, as representatives of Kashmiris.

 India had earlier suggested that an all-party goodwill delegation of Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah and other leaders be allowed to travel on the bus across the LoC to hold talks with their Kashmiri counterparts from the other side. But Pakistan has not shown much enthusiasm on the proposal.

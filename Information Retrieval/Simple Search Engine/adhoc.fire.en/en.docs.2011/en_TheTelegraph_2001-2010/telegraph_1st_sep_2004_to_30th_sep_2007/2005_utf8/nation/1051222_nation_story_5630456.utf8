 Lady B on poll wagon

 Hyderabad, Dec. 21: Lady Bachchan has jumped into a ring where Lakshmi Parvathi had suffered a knockout, reports our special correspondent.

 Andhra Pradeshs political stage has a new entrant with Telugu filmdoms action star Vijayshanti (in picture) getting her party, Telengana Talli, registered with the poll panel. Going by the record of a former woman party boss, shell be battling heavy odds.

 Lakshmi Parvathi was routed as TDP-NTR chief in the 1996 election, even with BJP support, after husband NTRs death. By 1998, she had neither a party nor BJP backing.

 Now many are willing to write off Vijayshanti, who has walked out of the BJP to champion the Telengana statehood cause, setting up a turf war with the embattled Telengana Rashtra Samiti (TRS).

 Telugu Desam boss Chandrababu Naidu pooh-poohed the actors dream of gaining power, while TRS leader N.N. Reddy scoffed: She is good enough for dummy filmi fights but not political fights on the streets.

 The actor, however, had proved a vote-catcher for the BJP before she left it six months ago over the denial of a Rajya Sabha ticket for the second time.

 She had brave words today, expressing confidence about support from the middle classes, backward classes and Dalits.

 Most TRS leaders are settlers from coastal Andhra or Velama landlords. They are not sons of the soil and dont feel the pinch of neglect, she said.

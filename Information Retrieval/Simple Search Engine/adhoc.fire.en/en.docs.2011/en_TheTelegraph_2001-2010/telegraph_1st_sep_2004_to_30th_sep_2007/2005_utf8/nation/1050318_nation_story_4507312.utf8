 Rain and slip 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, March 17: Just one millimetre of rain and the hill above Sevoke Road comes crashing down.

 In a telltale sign of the precarious condition of the Himalayan foothills, a landslide hit NH31 at Sevoke (about 20 km from here) following just one mm of rainfall caused by a ?cyclonic disturbance? last night.

 Marking the beginning of the ?landslip season?, the slide took place at 4.30 in the morning. The debris formed a four-foot hump, spread over a 15-m stretch between Coronation Bridge and Sevokeshwari Kali Temple, cutting off the main routes to Sikkim, Kalimpong and the Dooars from Siliguri for over seven hours.

 The General Reserve Engineering Force (Gref) of the Border Roads Organisation could clear the debris well after noon, following which the piled up traffic could move again. Dynamite was kept as a standby, but not used.

 ?I was stranded since six in the morning,? said Raju, one of the first drivers to reach the spot. ?When we reached, we saw the whole stretch covered with boulders, stone and loose earth. There was no way we could make a way and cross to the other side,? he said. 

 The waiting vehicles stretched 4 km on either side of the rubble by the time the road was finally cleared.

 Subir Sarkar, in-charge of North Bengal University?s weather station, said the slip is only a pointer to the extent of environmental degradation the Himalayas were facing.

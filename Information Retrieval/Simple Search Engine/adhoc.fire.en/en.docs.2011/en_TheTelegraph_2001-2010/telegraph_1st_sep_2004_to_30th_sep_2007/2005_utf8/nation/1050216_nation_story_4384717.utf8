 Holes in Roma kidnap killing 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 15: Police today introduced several elements contradicting much of what they had said yesterday, in the alleged murder of Arvind Bhai, who led Roma Jhawar?s abductors.

 On Monday, the police had disclosed that Gunjan Ghosh, the kidnap mastermind, had told them during interrogation that he had killed Arvind and that there were no witnesses. 

 The riders that the Criminal Investigation Department, probing the kidnapping, today added to the details have made the circumstances of the killing of Arvind more mysterious and left a string of questions.

 It was revealed yesterday that Gunjan informed the other kidnappers after murdering Arvind. However, the police today said there were four others ? Guddu, Munna, Pappu and Mukesh ? present when Gunjan shot Arvind in the head, unable to accept his demand for an ?unreasonable? share of the ransom.

 There are no answers why the police took a full 24 hours to suddenly ?discover? the four witnesses. The police merely said this was possibly because of a ?communication gap? with the media at yesterday?s briefing.

 Some of the other questions that remain unanswered are:

 According to the CID, all 

 the kidnappers, most of who are in police custody, including 

 witnesses Guddu and Munna, knew of the killing of Arvind 

 by Gunjan. Yet, despite intense grilling for the last 10 

 days, none of them chose to reveal this. Why? 

 This is especially strange since some of the members of Arvind?s gang should have been upset that their boss had been bumped off by Gunjan and would want to settle a score with him by revealing the killing to the police.

 The police said Arvind?s 

 body, with a hole through the head, was discovered by a 

 policeman of the Paroma Investigation Centre. But he simply 

 registered it as a case of ?unnatural death?, which is done 

 when the cause of death is not known. In Arvind?s case, 

 it was evident he had been murdered as he had been shot. 

 How could the policeman have missed noticing the bullet 

 hole in Arvind?s head with blood oozing out of it?

 The police said that after 

 the murder, Arvind?s clothes were put in a heap and burnt 

 by the side of Subhas Sarovar. But, despite an extensive 

 search, no spot with traces of burnt marks has been found 

 anywhere near the lake.

 The killing apparently 

 took place in Gunjan?s Maruti Omni. But an inspection of 

 the car has not provided any indication of this.

 The police had claimed 

 that Arvind called up Gunjan on his mobile after the kidnap 

 mastermind was taken into custody. Unaware that Gunjan had 

 been arrested, Arvind had apparently threatened Gunjan with 

 ?dire consequences? for not having given him his share of 

 the ransom. By what the police say now, Arvind should have 

 been dead by then.

 More ships for navy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: The Indian Navy will order 36 ships to be built and is seeking government approval for a hike in its budgetary outlay from 17 per cent of defence expenditure to 20 per cent, navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash has said.

 The navy has already ordered the building of 27 ships and submarines. As far as my knowledge goes, this is one of the biggest ship-building programmes undertaken by any navy, Admiral Prakash said. But the orders for ships have been issued not so much to bolster its fleet but to phase out old warships.

 The Centre has given its in-principle approval for 36 more ships to be built. But this is contingent on the outlay for defence. Naval headquarters is working on its modernisation programme after the Prime Minister said 3 per cent the of GDP can be allocated for defence if economic growth is registered at 8 per cent.

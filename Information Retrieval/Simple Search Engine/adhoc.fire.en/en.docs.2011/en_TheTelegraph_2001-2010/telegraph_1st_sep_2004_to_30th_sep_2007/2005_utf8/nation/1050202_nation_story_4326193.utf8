 Scared voters refuse to court trouble

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Feb. 1: The vote ended a wait of 27 years, but most residents were not willing to take the risk.

 Only 17.3 per cent voters in the summer capital defied the separatists? call to boycott the civic polls, belying hopes that last week?s impressive turnout in north Kashmir would encourage people to come out and exercise their franchise.

 But local authorities said the turnout was an encouraging sign. ?People have expressed their faith in the democratic process,? said People?s Democratic Party leader and housing and urban development minister Ghulam Hassan Mir.

 ?I congratulate the people of Srinagar who came out to vote despite the threat. This has shown that they believe in peace and development,? he told a news conference.

 In north Kashmir, 49 per cent voters had exercised their franchise last Saturday.

 Polling for the 68 wards of the Srinagar municipal corporation began this morning under the shadow of separate strike calls by outfits like both factions of the All-Parties Hurriyat Conference and the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. At the end of the day, the authorities seemed relieved that the ballot process was generally incident-free following deployment of paramilitary forces and police.

 JKLF supporters took to the streets in the Maisuma area in the heart of the city this morning to enforce a complete shutdown. They pelted stones at police and security personnel who resorted to a lathicharge, official sources said. But no casualty was reported.

 Although the city remained deserted and shops closed, people lined up to cast their ballot in some areas like Chanpora, parts of Jawahar Nagar and on the outskirts. ?For the past 15 years, this locality has been totally neglected. That is why we came out to vote in the hope that we would get a better deal after electing local councillors,? said Abdul Rashid, a resident of Chanpora.

 ?This election has nothing to do with either the Kashmir problem or the larger dispute between India and Pakistan. This pertains only and only to civic facilities which have been totally neglected,? said Mehraj-ud-Din, a resident of Ikhrajpora.

 National Conference president Omar Abdullah was among those who cast their ballot early. 

 Local MLAs were seen supporting their party candidates at several places as the civic polls saw a direct contest between the ruling PDP and the National Conference.

 Kargil coffins at breakfast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 8: Union defence minister Pranab Mukherjee told Left leaders today that the government will file a supplementary affidavit in the Supreme Court in the Kargil coffin scam.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had invited Left leaders to breakfast at his residence today to discuss the forthcoming visits of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to India. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi was also present.

 Left leaders told the Prime Minister that the government has ?messed up? the coffin case and should now take measures to rectify the situation. 

 Sonia, according to Left sources, also expressed her dissatisfaction with the way the case has been handled.

 Mukherjee assured that a supplementary affidavit would be filed. Later, Union law minister H.R. Bharadwaj told the media that the ?facts missing? from the earlier affidavit would be included in it.

 The government had told the Supreme Court in response to a public interest litigation that military purchases made for the Kargil war in 1999 were above board, thereby indirectly exonerating George Fernandes, who was then defence minister.

 The stand delighted the BJP and Fernandes, who had been at the receiving end of the Opposition?s wrath all through the NDA regime. 

 Sonia had especially targeted Fernandes in her Lok Sabha election campaign.

 During the NDA regime, the entire Opposition, led by the Congress and the Left, walked out every time Fernandes rose to make a statement in either House.

 Within the Congress, grumbles of discontent have begun over the government?s shoddy handling of the Kargil case. Like the Left, many Congressmen have said the government should have done a better job. Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has said the cabinet committee on political affairs should have cleared the affidavit.

 The BJP reacted angrily to the suggestion and its spokesperson Arun Jaitley said the government is trying to give a political slant to the case by saying that it should be referred to the cabinet committee on political affairs. 

 ?The truth has now come out even if it is because of political incompetence,? said Jaitley. ?Such a thing has never been done and the UPA government wants to keep the pot boiling,? said the BJP spokesperson.

 Earlier, Fernandes had threatened to move a defamation case against Sonia. The Congress, for its part, has maintained that the affidavit in the court has not exonerated Fernandes. 

 It is a stand that the bureaucracy has taken and the court has not taken a decision.

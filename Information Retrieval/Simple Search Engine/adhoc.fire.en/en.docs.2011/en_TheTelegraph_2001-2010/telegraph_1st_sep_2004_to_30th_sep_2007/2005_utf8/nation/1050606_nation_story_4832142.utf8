 Sushmita spots a Switzerland in Kashmir

 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES 

 Srinagar, June 5: Sushmita Sens next film could be shot in our own Switzerland if the actor makes good her promise to promote Kashmir in Bollywood.

 It is homecoming for me. I came here on a visit when I was just nine years old, the actor said. 

 Speaking to journalists at the scenic Royal Springs Golf Course, the former Miss Universe said: Filmmakers should not go outside the country. Our own Switzerland presents immense potential for outdoor shooting. 

 Sushmita, who arrived here yesterday on a three-day visit, promised she would motivate her colleagues in the film industry to come to the state. 

 We are missing Kashmir. I will try to do my next film in Kashmir. I will come here with my production network and motivate other colleagues to come to the state. 

 Golfer Jyoti Randhawa described the golf course as the prettiest golf course in Asia. The 20-hole sprawling course has the lofty Zabarwan Mountains as the backdrop and the majestic Dal Lake in front.

 Sushmita also had a word of praise for Kashmiri women, whom she found naturally beautiful. 

 The fair sex in Kashmir is more pretty than actresses. We have several layers of make-up to look beautiful but Kashmiri women are naturally beautiful, she said.

 The star also visited Muskaan, an orphanage run by the army for militancy-affected children in central Srinagar. She was moved by the children at the orphanage, situated at Tatoo ground in Batmaloo. The actor also appreciated the human face of the army and commended the troops for their noble venture.

 Sushmita conveyed her gratitude for the sacrifices made by soldiers to bring back normality in the Valley.

 The army sources told Sushmita that they have launched many projects and welfare measures to alleviate the problems of people in the state.

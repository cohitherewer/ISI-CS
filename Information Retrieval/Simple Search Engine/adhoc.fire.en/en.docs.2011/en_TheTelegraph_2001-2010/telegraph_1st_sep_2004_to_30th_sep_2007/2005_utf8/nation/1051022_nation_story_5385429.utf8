 New Delhi, Oct. 21: The army has made recommendations on opening certain points along the Line of Control through which relief for quake victims in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir can be distributed, the chief of army staff, General Joginder Jaswant Singh, said here today.

 The general did not spell out what the recommendations were, but prefaced his reply to a question by saying the Prime Minister has already made a magnanimous offer to Pakistan that India will pull out all stops to give relief to victims of the earthquake.

 The armys recommendations are in line with the Prime Ministers wishes.

 It is understood that army headquarters has carried out an exercise to identify the points through which access can be granted and the nature of that access. There are up to four points along the 740-km LoC that have been identified through which humanitarian aid and access can be granted. 

 We are aware of the Prime Ministers magnanimous offer a few days ago on a humanitarian issue. The army has given its recommendations to the government. Based on the response from the other side, we are ready to implement the directives of the government, Singh said.

 General JJ was unwilling to respond to the question if granting of access along the LoC was militarily feasible. At the same time, he has made it clear that the army is not vetoing the proposal to open up the LoC for movement of aid.

 The recommendations of army headquarters forwarded to the government come in the wake of Pakistan President Pervez Musharrafs statement at a news conference in Islamabad earlier this week that the LoC needs to be opened to give succour to Kashmirs quake victims. 

 But New Delhi was still waiting for a message from Islamabad that will explain Musharrafs suggestion.

 We have not received any official proposal from Islamabad to this effect, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said earlier this morning. We can initiate action only after we receive an offer at the official level.

 But it was clear that New Delhi has already begun its homework. However, crucial questions relating to the tenuous process of creating entry-exit points along the contentious LoC are still unanswered:

 Does the government envisage 

 opening points on the LoC to facilitate movement of people 

 to and from either side?

 Will India, which has not 

 appealed for international aid for quake victims, accept 

 Pakistani authorities offer of help? A Pakistani minister, 

 Sheikh Rasheed, has made such an offer.

 Does the army think it 

 is feasible to grant transit rights for relief through certain 

 places along the LoC?

 How does the army envisage 

 a scenario in which it will have to police movement of civilian 

 traffic along such places?

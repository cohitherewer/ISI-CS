 Indigenous reactor goes critical 

 Tarapur, March 6 (PTI): The country?s first indigenously designed 540-mw pressurised heavy water reactor here attained criticality today, Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar said. 

 The reactor, unit 4 of Tarapur Atomic Power Station ?the flagship plant of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited ? will be connected to the western grid for commercial purposes before August, Kakodkar said. 

 With this, the total nuclear power generated in the country will be 3,310 mw, he said.

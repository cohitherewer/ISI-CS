 Kalam bid for secrecy clause

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 25: The Centre is assessing a note sent by the President to the Prime Minister suggesting modifications in the right to information law.

 A.P.J Abdul Kalam is in favour of protecting presidential immunity and confidentiality of official communications between the Prime Minister and the President while implementing the new law.

 As he granted presidential assent to the right to information bill last week, Kalam is believed to have sent to the Prime Minister a separate note spelling out the suggestions.

 The bill, considered a landmark law to establish transparency and accountability in governance, was passed by Parliament during the budget session. Though the President has given his assent, the act is yet to be notified. It will come into force after the mandatory gazette notification. 

 The home ministry is likely to refer the Presidents note to the law ministry. The law ministry plays a role in framing rules for implementing the act.

 Kalam suggested that notings made by bureaucrats on files should also remain privileged information. Otherwise, he felt, the decision-making process would be affected.

 The act has some provisions to deny information to the public. National security is one such ground but the exemption does not cover communication between the President and the Prime Minister.

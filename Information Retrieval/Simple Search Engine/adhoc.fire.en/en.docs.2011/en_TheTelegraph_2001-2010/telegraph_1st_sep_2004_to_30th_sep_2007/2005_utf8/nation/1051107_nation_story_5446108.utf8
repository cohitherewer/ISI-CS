 Rickshaw-puller sues bribe cops

 New Delhi (PTI): A rickshaw-puller has 

 moved a Delhi court seeking protection from corrupt 

 police officials who allegedly threatened to implicate 

 him in false cases if he did not pay them.

 In his complaint, Lalit Sharma alleged he was asked to pay a bribe of Rs 2,000 by a beat constable on October 21. On refusal, his permit was confiscated. Three days later, he was summoned to the police station where a sub-inspector threatened him, the petition said.

 Sharma has demanded a departmental inquiry against the two.

 He also alleged that written complaints to the police commissioner yielded no result. Rather, the beat constable thrashed one of his associates when he came to know of it.

 The court, on the basis of Sharmas complaint on October 28, has directed the police station concerned to file a report by Tuesday.

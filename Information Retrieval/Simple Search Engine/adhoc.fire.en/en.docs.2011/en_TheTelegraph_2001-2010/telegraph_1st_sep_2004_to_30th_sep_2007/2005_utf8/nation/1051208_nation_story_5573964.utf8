 New Delhi, Dec. 7: A fire today broke out in an east Delhi factory manufacturing and packaging ladies innerwear for export, charring 12 people to death.

 The blaze started at 11.20 am on the second floor of Grover Sons, which is located in Gali no. 16 in the Vishwas Nagar area of Patparg- anj. Work was on in full swing at the factory, which has outlets in Karol Bagh and sells undergarments under the brand names Paris Beauty and Shalini.

 Although the factory is very close to the office of the deputy commissioner of police, east district, it is located in a residential area and does not have the requisite licence and fire clearance. 

 Police said the owner, Rakesh Grover, is absconding.

 Vishwas Nagar is the hub of illegal factories operating in residential areas and employing migrant labour. Factory owners continue to operate illegally despite Supreme Court orders to close down industrial units in non-conforming areas in Delhi.

 The police said all 12 bodies were recovered from the second floor. Three persons suffered burn injuries and one fractures in both hands.

 Two employees, Shyam Lal, 50, and Amrish, 25, managed to jump off the three-storey build- ing on to an adjacent single-storey one. 

 Witnesses said most of the nearly 80 people in the building escaped the same way.

 Amrish said workers were removing paint stains on the undergarments when the fire started. To remove the stains, we use a chemical, a thinner. This is applied using a gun. There was sparking in one of the guns and in minutes, there was a huge blaze.

 Shyam Lal said the building had only one entry and one exit. When the fire started, people on the lower floors saw the smoke and rushed out. The 12 persons on the second floor ran towards one room and tried to take cover but they were trapped and could not escape, he said.

 Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit has ordered a probe. 

 The police have registered a case under IPC Section 337 (causing grievous injury) and Section 304 A (causing death due to negligence) against the owner.

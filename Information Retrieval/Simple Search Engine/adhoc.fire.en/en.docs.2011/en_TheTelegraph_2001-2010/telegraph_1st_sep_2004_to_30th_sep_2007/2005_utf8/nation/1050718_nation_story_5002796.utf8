 Cloud-seed plane lands in lake

 A Cessna-340 aircraft from the US forcelanded in Jakkur lake on the outskirts of Bangalore on Saturday following a snag. 

 Both the pilot and the co-pilot are safe. 

 The aircraft had landed in Bangalore about five days ago en route to Andhra Pradesh for cloud-seeding operations. It was cleared by the customs on Saturday, said Captain Arvind Sharma, the managing director of Agni Aviation, which hired the aircraft.

 One aircraft is already engaged in cloud-seeding operations in Andhra Pradesh.

 He said the pilot noticed some problem after take-off and diverted the plane into the lake.

 He did what any good pilot would do, Sharma said.

 Visitors fan out to meet relatives

 Jammu, April 9 (PTI): Four out of 10 residents of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, who arrived here last evening, today left for Rajouri and Poonch districts of Jammu and Kashmir to meet their relatives.

 After an overwhelming reception in Srinagar on Thursday, 10 out of 30 passengers of the Muzaffarabad area of PoK reached here by road late last evening to meet their relatives in different parts of Jammu.

 Earlier, the visitors were received by their relatives and various prominent people, including some leaders of the Congress and the People?s Democratic Party and councillors of the Jammu Municipal Corporation at TCP Nagrota, 12 km from here.

 Appreciating Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed for their efforts to open the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, vice-chairman of the Pahari Advisory Committee Shabir Ahmed Khan said people on both sides of the Line of Control had been waiting for this day for the last five decades.

 Nissar Ahmed Mir, who left Jammu in 1948 for PoK when he was only eight, said he was happy to come here after 57 years to see his relatives.

 Mir, who retired as an assistant commissioner in PoK, thanked Singh and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf for opening the Jhelum valley road to enable the divided families to meet each other.

 Another visitor, Hussain Rathore, said the credit for initiating the peace process between the two countries goes to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 He said there was a need to open up other roads also as it takes a long time to reach Jammu and other parts of the state by the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar road.

 Rathore said he left Jammu in 1965 where he has five sisters and uncles, whom he wanted to meet apart from an old friend, Trilochan Singh.

 Expressing happiness over opening of the road, Sadar Mohammad Bashir Khan said: ?We should thank all the people who worked for it.?

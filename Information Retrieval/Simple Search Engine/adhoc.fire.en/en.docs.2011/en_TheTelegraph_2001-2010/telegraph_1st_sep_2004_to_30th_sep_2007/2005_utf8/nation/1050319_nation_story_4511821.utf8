 Notice to Dalmiya

 Chennai, March 18 (PTI): The former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Jagmohan Dalmiya, and BCCI secretary S.K. Nair have been issued notices of contempt of court, returnable on Monday. 

 Judge Mohideen Pitchai of the Madras city civil court today issued the notices to the two after Dalmiya attended a meeting of the International Cricket Council in New Delhi yesterday. On January 25, the court had restrained the board from nominating Dalmiya as its representative for attending meetings of the ICC.

 The petitioner, Sri Thyagaraya Cricket Club here, moved the court today for contempt of court proceedings against both Dalmiya and the BCCI.

 Council ticks tips for farm finance 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: The National Advisory Council has decided to go by the recommendations of the A. Vaidyanathan committee on how best to finance small and marginal farmers.

 The task force on Revival of the Rural Cooperative Credit Institutions, headed by the agricultural economist, was set up by finance minister P. Chidambaram in 2004 to examine the reforms required in the cooperative lending system. 

 The task force called for:

 Special financial assistance 

 to wipe out accumulated losses and strengthen the capital 

 base of cooperative credit institutions

 Democracy in the functioning 

 of the institutions. State governments should stop interfering 

 in the banks financial management, it said, and borrowers 

 and depositors should get full voting rights.

 An empowered implementing 

 and monitoring committee at the national, state and district 

 levels with representatives of principal stakeholders

 Change of the legal framework 

 to empower the Reserve Bank of India to enforce prudent 

 financial management

 Special audits to get a 

 realistic picture of financial problems at different levels.

 The committee assessed a recap amount of about Rs 15,000 crore to be shared by the Centre, states and the cooperatives in the ratio of 53:31:16.

 A meeting of the advisory council, chaired by Sonia Gandhi, this evening agreed to push the recommendations. The council is a 12-member body headed by Sonia which oversees implementation of the common minimum programme by the Union government.

 A news release put out by the council after the meeting said: Attention would be drawn to inbuilt guarantees to increase coverage for small and marginal farmers and for integrating the requirements of women self-help groups in various parts of the country.

 The meeting decided to pay special attention to expand institutional credit in the Northeast where community ownership of land is common.

 It also resolved to raise specific action points with the Centre to focus on the implementation of wasteland development programmes and to prepare a new national policy for resettlement and rehabilitation of families affected by projects which require land acquisition.

 Court scans IAS officer cases

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: The Supreme Court today asked the CBI to give details of cases pending against Sanjeev Kumar, the IAS officer who blew the whistle on irregularities in the appointment of 3,000 primary teachers in Haryana when Om Prakash Chautala was the chief minister.

 A three-judge bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti, Justices D.M. Dharmadhikari and G.P. Mathur asked additional solicitor-general P.P. Malhotra to give details of the cases being investigated by the bureau against Kumar, as well as the status of the disciplinary proceedings against him pending with the Central Vigilance Commission by tomorrow.

 Kumars counsel Anil Baburao Diwan contended that the ?whistle-blower IAS officer? is being harassed by the CBI and pleaded for protection to him. He also criticised the bureau and the statement made by its spokesperson after raids on Kumars residence on April 7 and 8. The bench has sought a copy of the spokespersons statement.

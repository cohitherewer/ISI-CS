 IIM Lucknow: Exchange pact

Lucknow, Aug. 30: The students exchange programme in the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow has come of age with 31 students ? the highest so far from the establishment ? being selected for three-month stints at B-schools of western countries.

 The students will join B-schools in France, Denmark, Switzerland, Canada and nine other countries with which IIML has tie-ups. Seventeen students from these countries will come to the Lucknow institute for three months.

 There is a marked growth in the number of students joining foreign campuses as last time 27 students had joined foreign country B-schools, says Prerna Kapoor, an office- bearer of the Students Committee for Media Affairs.

 IIML had launched the students exchange programme in 2000-01 with tie-ups with 13 universities in western countries. That year nine students had gone abroad and two had come to IIML.

 The numbers have since jumped. Out of the total 260 students (in the final year at IIML this year), 31 were selected by a faculty committee and chosen for (stints at) the B-schools in these countries, said N.K. Mitash, a member of the students affairs committee.

 Of the 31 students selected, seven are IIT graduates. 

 The students are selected on the basis of their overall profile, interview and their response during counselling, said R.K. Raina, a faculty member.

 The exchange programme is a great opportunity to understand the milieu of foreign B-schools, says Shatadal Kumar, who will be going to a B-school in France.

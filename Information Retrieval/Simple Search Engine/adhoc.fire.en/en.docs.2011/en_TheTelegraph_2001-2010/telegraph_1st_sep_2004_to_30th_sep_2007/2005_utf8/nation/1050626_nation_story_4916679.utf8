 Narayanan, Montek meet Burns 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 25: The US is likely to announce its support for Indias candidature in the UN Security Council after the summit meeting between President George W. Bush and Manmohan Singh next month.

 The Prime Minister will be in Washington on July 18. Although the meeting will give both sides a chance to take bilateral ties to a higher level, there is a feeling this will not happen if the US continues to be ambiguous on Indias UN bid.

 Visiting US under-secretary of state for political affairs Nicholas Burns today held detailed meetings with national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. He also met former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra and foreign secretary Shyam Saran.

 Both Narayanan and Ahluwalia were in the US recently and their discussions with Burns were a continuation of the dialogue they had begun in Washington. Ahluwalia is in charge of the economic and energy dialogue.

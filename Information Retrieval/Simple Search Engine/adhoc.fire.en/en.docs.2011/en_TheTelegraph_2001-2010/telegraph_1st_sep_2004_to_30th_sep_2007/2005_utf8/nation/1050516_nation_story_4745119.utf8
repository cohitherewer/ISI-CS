 Hand-slash arrest

 Indore/Bhopal, May 15 (PTI): Four days after the attack on Madhya Pradesh woman and child development official Shakuntala Verma, who had opposed child marriages, the prime accused in the incident was today arrested in Rajgarh, 100 km from here.

 The arrest was made after Verma identified the accused, Suresh Balia, from one of the 10 photographs shown to her at her hospital bed in Indore where she is undergoing treatment, a government statement issued in Bhopal said. 

 Verma was attacked at her residence in Rajgarh in Dhar district on May 10 and one of her arms was nearly chopped off for her role in preventing child marriages in the state.

 Suresh was detained two days ago and was arrested today after he was identified, inspector-general of Indore range P.L. Pandey told reporters in Indore.

 Suresh was picked up by the police from Rajgarh on the basis of a sketch prepared by a cartoonist of a newspaper, he added.

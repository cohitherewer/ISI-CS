 Bihar legislators feast on goodies

 SAVVY SOUMYA

 Jamshedpur, May 22: The precious men from Bihar had food for thought ? and generous helpings of it at that ? during their stay at the two highway resorts.

 The food bills at 10th Mile Stone ? one of the two places where the MLAs put up ? ran up to Rs 1.25 lakh.

 From starters to beverages, kadhai paneer to chicken butter masala, scoops of ice cream to mango delicacies, they had it all.

 Employees at 10th Mile Stone said the MLAs and their aides didnt leave any item on the menu untouched during the two days they were there. 

 It was just food, of all varieties possible, and juices that topped the wishlist. None of the MLAs touched hard drinks and that was a welcome relief, said a waiter.

 Sources at 10th Mile Stone said apart from the breakfast, lunch and dinner, which was quite lavish, starters (both non-vegetarian and vegetarian) and juices (apple, orange, mango and pineapple) made the rounds for the entire day. Chicken was the favourite for the main course. 

 They said all the 10 rooms were booked in advance from May 19, but the management had no clue about the identity of the guests.

 The MLAs, who were supposed to arrive on Thursday morning, arrived late at night and stayed on for May 20 and May 21 before leaving for the resort for Commercial Plantation and Dairy Private Limited at Ghatshila early this morning. Initially, only 13 MLAs with their attendants reached 10th Mile Stone. The remaining lot joined them from Hill View Resort.

 Hill View resort employees said the bookings were made a day in advance by the administration for May 19 and the difference here was that the management knew who the guests would be.

 Hill View resort employees said they faced no problems from the MLAs and the bills too were minimal. They said the MLAs stuck to the basic meal of rice, dal and subzi. The MLAs stuck to a vegetarian diet and it was their security and the bodyguards who had loads of non vegetarian food.

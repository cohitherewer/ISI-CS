 Knight cap for Bengali babu

 AMIT ROY

 Chakravarti

 London, Dec. 30: Suma(ntra) Chakravarti, 45, the most senior Asian civil servant in Britain, has received a knighthood in the New Years Honours List announced today. 

 Chakravarti, who was talent-spotted by Tony Blair even before Labour came to power in 1997, receives a KCB ? a Knight Commander in the Order of Bath. 

 He has been the permanent secretary at the Department of International Development for the past three years and will henceforth be known as Sir Suma. 

 Also named in todays Honours List were all the members of the England cricket team which won the Ashes against Australia this summer in a tightly fought series that will go down in cricketing legend. 

 Duncan Fletcher, the Rhodesia-born coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, receive OBEs (Officer of the British Empire), as do the chairman of selectors, David Graveney, and Phil Neale, an overseas tour manager. 

 At one stage, it had been thought that Fletcher, to whom the home office had initially even refused a British passport, would receive a knighthood. 

 MBEs (Member of the British Empire), which is one step down in the rung of Britains complicated honours system, have been given to all the players who participated in the Ashes series ? Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff, Ashley Giles, Stephen Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Geraint Jones, Simon Jones, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Strauss and Marcus Trescothick. 

 It is perhaps only fair that the captain of the England womens cricket team, Clare Connor, whose side also beat the Australians during the summer, has been honoured with an OBE. 

 When Chakravarti was appointed a permanent secretary in 2002, he was 42, the youngest civil servant to head a government department. 

 According to the stereotype of permanent secretaries portrayed by Sir Humphrey Appleby (who was played by the late Sir Nigel Hawthorne) in the BBC comedy series, Yes, Minister, it is senior civil servants who allegedly exercise the real political power behind the scenes in Whitehall. 

 Chakravarti, who was born in Jalpaiguri in 1959 and moved to the UK with his parents after spending the first five years of his life in Calcutta, was educated at the City of London School, a high achieving public school, and at New College, Oxford, where he read PPE (Politics, Philosophy and Economics). 

 He followed this with an MA in development economics from Sussex University. 

 In 1984, he joined the Overseas Development Agency, now called the Department of International Development, as an economist. 

 He rose through the ranks of the civil service, and was the director of the performance and innovation unit at the cabinet office from 1998-2000. He has also worked for the treasury. 

 When he first took over his current ?120,000 a year post in 2002, Chakravarti announced he would work from his home in Oxford every other Friday to achieve a better work-life balance and take his daughter, Maya, to her school assembly. 

 It is part of the understanding of my new job, he said at the time. I want to maintain that.

 On Sonia plate: to rule or not to rule 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 For status quo? (From 

 top) Sonia Gandhi, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, Manmohan Singh

 Oct. 1: Sonia Gandhi had 

 in October 2002 overruled the Jammu and Kashmir Congress 

 and the partys working committee to crown Mufti Mohammad 

 Sayeed chief minister of the troubled state in the larger 

 national interest.

 In October 2005, the Congress president is faced with the same decision ? whether to take over the reins or allow the PDP leader to continue.

 A hawkish state unit is pushing for a change of guard, reminding Sonia constantly of the three-year power-rotation agreement between the Congress and the PDP.

 But the power rotation formula was never put on record. The eight-page, 31-point common minimum programme thrashed out between Mufti, Muzzafar Baig and Mehbooba Mufti on one side and Manmohan Singh, Arjun Singh and Ghulam Nabi Azad on the other talks about everything ? from according official language status to Dogri to the protection of Kashmiriat ? but that. 

 Sonia and the Prime Minister are said to be reluctant to push for a change of guard in Kashmir. 

 Singh has reportedly requested the party chief not to requisition Azad, the parliamentary affairs minister, considered a favourite in the case of Muftis exit.

 Azad is keeping his cards close to his chest. He has discreetly made it known that he is less than keen to head the Kashmir government, but has also started visiting the Valley more frequently. The itineraries largely consist of dargahs and other Sufi shrines, reflecting his old comment that he would need the hand of God to run Kashmir.

 Sonia consulted more than a dozen Kashmir hands in the last fortnight on the change of guard and the feedback was a nearly unanimous message to desist. Any tinkering with the present arrangement could affect the peace process, the experts said.

 However, the political component within the Congress differs. The continuation of the present regime would demoralise workers and affect the prospects of revival of the national party in the Valley, they said. Sonias first responsibility should be to safeguard the partys interest, they argued.

 A look at Muftis tenure throws up a mixed bag. Many promises remain unfulfilled, but the three years have shown a semblance of governance, the most redeeming feature of the 2002 Assembly polls. There is a sense of administration rekindled, especially public works. There is genuine political activity, which even the Hurriyat has taken note of. A route has successfully been opened across the Line of Control.

 In Sonias scheme of things, Singh has always had a special place while dealing with Kashmir. In October 2002, when there was no sign that Singh would become Prime Minister, Sonia had picked him to be the Congresss representative to finalise the common minimum programme with the PDP ? instead of the man of all seasons, Pranab Mukherjee, who was heading the partys Kashmir committee.

 Sources close to Sonia said it was Singhs detached view of judging the Kashmir problem above party lines that helped her decide to overrule local party aspirations.

 It may be time for the big two to once again look beyond the partys political concerns.

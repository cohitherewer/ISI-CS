 Sex worker law sent back to limbo

 Chowdhary: Debate cry

 New Delhi, June 29: The fate of a crucial amendment to the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act hangs in balance with the cabinet sending back the proposed change to a group of ministers.

 The amendment proposed an end to punishing sex workers who are found soliciting, loitering and offending public decency. But at a recent meeting, cabinet members, including women ministers, did not want the change.

 It trivialises the issue. What we need is a national debate on the matter, tourism minister Renuka Chowdhary said. She believes such amendments will make no difference. It is the tout who usually solicits, the minister added.

 The department of women and children, which had proposed the amendment, has a different view. More and more women are being booked under the anti-trafficking act, whereas very few traffickers are brought within its ambit, says a department note.

 The National Commission for Women and womens organisations, which have long been campaigning for removal of the section on punishing sex workers, do not buy the cabinets arguments. 

 The act punishes women sex workers on grounds of morality, says an activist. Women are sitting ducks for the police while traffickers are dodging the dragnet.

 Chowdhary does not agree. How will the amendment help the woman liberate herself? she asks. Will it empower her with rights or help her to liberate herself from the clutches of the pimp?

 The cabinet decision to refer the amendment to a group of ministers reflects the opinion of states like Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Delhi that are opposed to the removal of the clause. They believe it will encourage sex trade.

 The other proposed amendments include increasing the child label to 18 from 16 and making punishment for traffickers more stringent.

 The amendments came after the department of women and children held a series of consultations with legal institutions and womens organisations. 

 The government had asked the National Law School in Bangalore to review the act.

 India, US for complex war games

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: The Indian and US militaries have decided to increase the complexity of exercises in 2006, beginning with an army drill in January at Chaubatia near Ranikhet, US embassy officials said here today.

 A company of the US Army will engage with a similar force from the Indian Army for exercises in counter-insurgency operations. The officials said this is the largest contingent that the US Army would be sending to India for exercises. 

 The biggest war game between India and the US, however, was the October 2005 edition of the Malabar series of exercises that involved two aircraft carriers (the USS Nimitz and the INS Viraat) and close to 10,000 sailors.

 The officials said in a scaling-up of military-to-military ties, the Indian Air Force will participate in the Cooperative Cope Thunder (CCT) series of exercises again. The CCT, involving air forces from many countries, has in the past been held in Alaska.

 Efforts were also on to involve the IAF in the Red Flag exercises in Texas in the middle of 2006. These are the biggest combat aircraft exercises and will be more complex than last months Cope India out of Kharagpur for which the US Air Force deployed 12 F-16s and an E3C Sentry Awacs.

 The officials said in the last four years, the Indian and US militaries have engaged in 30 exercises, a dramatic rise since the 1990s.

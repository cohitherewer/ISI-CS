 BJP acts fast on Stained Six

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: The party with a difference today woke up to images of six of its MPs taking bribe.

 But unlike the BJPs stubborn defence of its leaders Bangaru Laxman and Dilip Singh Judeo after two earlier sting operations, the party and its chief have been quick to describe the incident as shameful. 

 Almost relieved that the scandal involves other parties as well, BJP president L.K. Advani said: We have spoken to the Speaker. Strictest action should be taken if the charges are proved to be correct.

 The party has acted fast too. 

 Though all the top leaders were busy at a chief ministers conference today, the BJP issued suspension orders to all the six MPs and set up a committee to probe the incident.

 Soon after video clips of party MPs accepting bribe were flashed on a TV channel, BJP spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said all the persons prima facie found guilty have been issued show-cause notices. 

 The BJP, she added, has set up its own inquiry committee, though the ethics committee of Parliament is looking into the matter.

 Parliamentary committees would look into aspects concerning parliamentary ethics. But they are also members of the BJP. The party is extremely concerned about this. All those involved have been issued show-cause notices. They have been given three days time to reply. It is shameful behaviour. Strictest action would be taken if charges are proved to be correct, said Sushma.

 The six MPs caught taking bribe for raising questions in Parliament are Y.G. Mahajan, Anna Saheb M.K. Patil, Suresh Chandel, Pradeep Gandhi, Chandra Pratap Singh and Chhattrapal Singh Lodha.

 The RSS, which never condemned either Bangaru Laxman or Dilip Singh Judeo ? both caught taking money on camera ? announced its distaste for such corrupt practices.

 We have always considered character as a very important aspect of public life. Unfortunately, those in important public offices like MPs have been found indulging in activities that are condemnable, said RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav. 

 Some of these MPs, especially Patil and Lodha, have been associated with the Sanghs activities related to swadeshi and cow protection.

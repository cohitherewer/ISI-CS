 Laloo shaken, but in for toughest fight yet

 Patna, Feb. 20: The road from Patna to Nalanda has a fascinating past. After the First World War, it was the route from the plateau to the south to the Ganga and onward to Burma.

 The rains last year were poor and much hinges on the winter crop of wheat. Gnarled shisham trees border the road, with fields where labourers and farmers are bringing in the potato harvest.

 A very different kind of harvest awaits the political hopefuls on February 23. But it is here that the pattern is a striking one.

 For all the talk of Ram Vilas Paswan, the main fight is between the two big rival camps: the RJD and the NDA. The latter includes and subsumes the arrow symbol or teer nishan of the Janata Dal (United).

 Hopes run high for Naresh Sharma in Vaikunthpur, a woodcraft worker. He trusts Nitish to free him and other carpenters from the forest department?s tax on wood. He is sure the 150-odd mistris or carpenters in the village all think alike on this matter.

 In nearby Harnaut, there is another kind of feeling for the Janata Dal (United)?s chief ministerial aspirant. ?He never gets anything done,? counters Ram Naresh Singh. No bridges were built even where they were vitally needed.

 The Lok Janshakti Party hopes to step into the breach and its organisers exude confidence. A senior Congressman in their office is much more circumspect. He agrees they are in the race but cautions against complacence.

 The same camp still commands loyalty of an old trader family of Bakhtiyarpur. It?s a sari-selling Marwari family, all of whose younger sons have been packed off to study outside the state. They admit some of the educated folk are shifting from the lotus symbol to the Congress hand. 

 A trio of a Yadav family seems divided on generation lines. ?Laloo?s gift is free travel to all of these youngsters who don?t even buy train tickets,? says the aged Kuldeep Rai.

 His son Ram Chandra Yadav sums up the topography. The town will be with the BJP but the lantern will shine in the villages around.

 Biharsharif is agog with news of a helicopter landing by Paswan. His candidate here is a Yadav though it is the Kushwahas who are more numerous. The meeting itself is well attended but the crowd seems indifferent, even lacklustre.

 The mood outside the dargah or shrine of the Sufi saint at Biharsharif is sombre. Talking to a small crowd of Muslims, what is striking is the diversity of backgrounds and yet, the near unanimity in what they plan to do.

 No one is an outright admirer of the Laloo Prasad family. ?They have done nothing and will do nothing for development.?

 The logic is crystal clear. ?We are not bonded labour of Laloo and please write that down,? says Muhammad Ain-ul-Haq. But the priority is to defeat the BJP, whose threat is far from over. Anger at the RJD too simmers. ?We (are) alive but with nothing to eat,? rues Muhamad Javed.

 Over the last few weeks, the Janata Dal (United)?s Engineer Sunil has stoked fears by asking not only for a vote from each citizen but a brick from each house. The idea is to build a temple on disputed government land. A Kurmi by caste, the strategy probably aims to consolidate Hindu voters.

 The effect of this is to reinforce a widespread Muslim sentiment that the Hindutva party is still very much a force. The only person who can get support from the minority is the one who can beat back the BJP.

 What works in Laloo Prasad?s favour is not just his record of taking on the Sangh parivar. It is the core vote that he already has that keeps most Muslims with him. The Congress brings smiles to the faces of all, but they point out it is in the race in far too few seats. Paswan is seen as far too fickle a customer.

 Their votes would remain with Laloo Prasad. The significance of this has to be seen in the context of the wider caste calculus. The 93 seats that go to the polls on February 23 have a Muslim presence of less than 10 per cent.

 But these voters are incremental: they will mostly align with whoever is the best bet to beat the NDA. The stakes for the latter, and more so for the BJP, are highest. Nineteen of its 36 sitting MLAs are up for re-election.

 Local factors matter. In Biharsharif, Pappu Khan of the RJD is praised for his work in getting the dirt track roads metal-topped.

 In the rural hinterland, many voters freely admit that they expect no great deeds from the government. Krishendeo Prasad is an orderly in the district magistrate?s office in the town and hard at work in the morning, supervising the potato harvest.

 Power supply is not assured and lasts barely two hours a day. By bonding together, the farmers are able to pay for the power but they even work at night as and when there is a flow of ?current?.

 ?We pay Rs 340 a bag for chemical fertiliser but for the last 20 years there is no government supply at a subsidy,? rues Rajesh Deepak, who holds a BSc. degree. The potato crop is good this year but will have to be sold at a paltry Rs 80.

 What is important is that no politician even promises, let alone delivers, on these vital issues. Nor does it seem a decisive electoral issue.

 As we leave Biharsharif, the image that stays is that of the dargah. The deep shade of neem trees adds to the peace of the holy spot. And there are lively voices of the gaggle of men at the gate, debating their options on voting day.

 As the game goes down to the wire, the pattern in the third phase is clear. Paswan and Congress are indeed a factor but in specific pockets. 

 The RJD is shaken but not out. This is the toughest fight yet in a long time but a fight it is.

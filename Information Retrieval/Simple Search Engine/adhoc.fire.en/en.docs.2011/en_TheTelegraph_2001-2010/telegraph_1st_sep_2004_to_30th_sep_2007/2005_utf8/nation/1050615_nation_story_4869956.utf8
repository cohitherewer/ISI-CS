 VHP tells Advani to take sanyas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has asked L.K. Advani to take sanyas (retirement) from politics for insulting the country with his remarks on Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

 A special resolution, adopted by the VHP on the first day of the two-day meeting of the kendriya marg darshak mandal ? its highest decision-making body ? in Hardwar condemned Advanis Pakistan visit and congratulated the BJP for rejecting the observations he penned on Jinnah on his visit to the Quaid-e-Azams mausoleum in Karachi on June 4. 

 The manner in which Advani insulted India on Pakistani soil and remained adamant on his stand, the only option available to him is to take total sanyas from politics, VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia said, reading out the resolution.

 It accused him of betraying India in an enemy country and asked him to come clean on what selfish interest prompted him to do so. The outfit wanted to know who Advanis idol was, Veer Savarkar or Jinnah.

 The resolution asserted that the creation of Pakistan was to date unacceptable to every patriotic citizen. It said: From sage Aurobindo to the new generation, everyone is committed to the cause of akhand Bharat (greater India). By describing Pakistan as an unalterable reality of history, Advani has insulted crores of patriots, including Aurobindo?. 

 The VHP took exception to Advani describing the Babri demolition as the saddest day of my life and reminded him of how he had repeatedly referred to the mosque as a de jure, de facto temple. The resolution said his words had not only blackened his Ram rath yatra but also insulted the sentiments of the 85 crore Hindus involved in the temple agitation.

 It charged him with staging a weeklong drama of resigning and withdrawing his resignation instead of apologising to the nation for his shameful statement. 

 It is learnt that some senior religious leaders like Swami Parmanand Saraswati of the Akhara Parishad and Vishweshranand Maharaj, had voiced reservations about passing a resolution that condemned a single individual but were overruled by Togadia, Ashok Singhal and Acharya Giriraj Kishore. 

 The BJP today defended Advani. Party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said: We outrightly reject the VHPs suggestion. The BJP has full faith in his leadership and we feel the country and the party need his leadership.

 The RSS was mum. 

 Sources said Togadia had a personal motive in trashing the BJP chief as he was convinced that Advani was Narendra Modis firm supporter. Modi and Togadia are reportedly not on the best of terms after the VHP leader evinced interest in joining mainstream politics and was suspected to have had a hand in instigating dissidence against Modi.

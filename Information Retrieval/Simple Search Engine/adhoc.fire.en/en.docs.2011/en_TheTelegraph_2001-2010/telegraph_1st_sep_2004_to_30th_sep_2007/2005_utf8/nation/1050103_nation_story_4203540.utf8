 Divine duel in dacoit hunt

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Jan. 2: Divine intervention is the order of the day in the battle between police and dacoits in Madhya Pradesh.

 On New Year?s Eve, additional director-general of police N.K. Tripathi performed a yagna in Gwalior district in a bid to bring down dacoit Rambabu Gadaria.

 Tripathi, who is known as a ?supercop? for his exploits in nabbing dacoits, has been facing flak over his failure to capture Gadaria despite being given a force of 800-odd men armed with sophisticated equipment and unlimited funds.

 Gadaria carries a cash reward of over Rs 5 lakh on his head after he mowed down 13 Gujjars at Bhanwarpura on October 29 last year, intensifying caste tension in the Chambal region and embarrassing the BJP state government.

 Tripathi and some of his best men participated in the yagna at Dhoomeshwar temple in Dabra tehsil, some 350 km north of Bhopal, that was conducted under the supervision of Pandit Dharmendra Shastri from Mathura, Uttar Pradesh.

 Shastri is known to former chief minister Uma Bharti, who frequents Mathura for religious purposes.

 About 100 km away in adjoining Shivpuri district, Gadaria reportedly conducted a parallel yagna at Bisbhuji temple in Kolaras village.

 If the villagers are to be believed, Gadaria?s priest performed maha mrityunjaya yagna to ensure the dacoit?s longevity and freedom from untimely death.

 The yagna, characterised by the chanting of 21 mantras, is performed to achieve jaya or victory over mrityu (death) by invoking the blessings of Lord Shiva. Priest Anand Shankar Sharma of Ujjain said the yagna, if performed properly, alleviates the fear of untimely death.

 Fear or no, the state police are certainly under intense pressure to eliminate Gadaria, who has a penchant for cornering media mileage.

 A fortnight ago, the dacoit sent a letter to chief minister Babulal Gaur, spelling out his terms for surrender. His demands included a car, a house, a government job, a gun licence and farm land for each of his two-dozen gang members.

 The demands were never considered but they prompted Gaur to summon Tripathi to tell him to get ?results?.

 Tripathi has been camping in Gwalior and Chambal but without luck. He first dispatched commandos of the state police?s Hawk Force ? an elite group given special assignments ? and then the special task force. Both returned empty handed.

 Local police claimed that many villagers, conscious of caste affiliations, were reluctant to squeal on Gadaria, either out of kinship or fear.

 Mumbai, March 18: TV anchor and actor Aman Verma, who was reportedly shown on India TV last evening seeking sexual favours from a journalist posing as a Bollywood aspirant, today galvanised fellow actors against the controversial sting operation.

 Verma had lodged a complaint with Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy on Wednesday night, urging action against India TV. 

 However, by the time the social service branch of Mumbai police issued a notice to India TV on Thursday evening, the Rajat Sharma-headed channel had begun telecasting the clips allegedly showing Verma speaking to its reporter, Ruchi.

 On Friday morning, it was rumoured that Yash Chopra and Shahrukh Khan would appear in support of Verma at a news conference at Mehboob Studio. 

 Those who turned up included actors Salman Khan and Arbaaz Khan, actor-turned Congress MP Govinda, directors Ravi Chopra, David Dhawan, Raj Kanwar, and Suneel Darshan, and producers Vashu Bhagnani, Sajid Nadiadwala and Pahlaj Nihalani.

 Verma claimed, at the news conference, that the clips shown by the TV channel on Thursday had been doctored and shown selectively to malign his image.

 The actor also denied seeking anchor Suhaib Illyasi?s forgiveness. ?Nowhere in the tape is the face of the person kneeling visible. It was someone else posing,? he said.

 The anchor of highly-rated TV programmes like Khul Ja Sim Sim and Indian Idol alleged: ?After the episode, I have been constantly threatened by the girl Ruchi, Suhaib Illyasi and their team that the recordings will be telecast and the same continued for three months with a view to blackmail me and extort money from me.?

 Illyasi and his team denied the allegation.

 Bollywood stars alternated between denials and justifications over whether the casting couch really existed in the Mumbai entertainment industry.

 ?What is this casting couch? I have never seen such a thing, have you?? Salman Khan asked a reporter. 

 ?It exists in every industry. Why is the media targeting the film industry?? asked Nihalani.

 One after the other, Bollywood personalities issued character certificates to Verma, saying they knew him closely and asserting that he would not ask for sexual favours from a Bollywood aspirant. 

 Some also cast aspersions on Ruchi?s character, alleging that she had provoked the reactions from Verma.

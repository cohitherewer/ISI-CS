 PM date with king on cards

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 21: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could hold a meeting with Nepal?s King Gyanendra on the sidelines of the Asian-African Summit that begins in Jakarta tomorrow.

 Kathmandu has made an informal request for a meeting. If Delhi agrees, this will be the first contact at the highest political level between the neighbours since Gyanendra seized power in a coup and declared emergency on February 1. 

 India has criticised the king?s action and has been pressing for restoration of democracy.

 On April 24, Singh and the other leaders attending the summit, popularly called the Bandung Summit after the name of the place in Indonesia where it was first held in April 1955 under the initiative of Jawaharlal Nehru, are scheduled to come out with a declaration to mark its 50th anniversary. The leaders are also expected to identify steps for working together to meet new challenges.

 Gyanendra who finally met the Indian ambassador in Kathmandu, Shiv Mukherjee, last week after keeping him waiting for over two months, has informally indicated his keenness for a meeting with the Prime Minister. It is not clear if a formal request has been made.

 ?So far, they have not put in a formal request. But if they do, we will be happy to have a meeting between the two leaders. We have not stopped engaging with Nepal,? said a senior South Block official.

 Delhi had used Gyanendra?s action of dismissing Sher Bahadur Deuba?s government and imposing emergency in the country as a reason for staying away from the Saarc Summit scheduled to be held in Dhaka in February. 

 The king has since taken steps to release some democratic leaders, including the Nepali Congress chief, Girija Prasad Koirala. 

 However, there are indications that the Indian leadership is not satisfied with these moves and wants Gyanendra to take urgent steps to lift emergency, release all the political leaders and remove the ban on the media. Delhi is keen that the king starts engaging with the political leaders to find a consensus on Maoist rebels.

 An engagement between India and Bangladesh is also likely on the sidelines of the Bandung meet. Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia has decided to stay away from the summit, but the country is being represented by foreign minister Morshed Khan, who has already reached Jakarta.

 There is a possibility that Khan will meet his Indian counterpart, K. Natwar Singh, and try to remove the strain in relations following the killing of a BSF officer in Tripura. 

 Singh will be meeting Chinese President Hu Jintao and Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Jakarta.

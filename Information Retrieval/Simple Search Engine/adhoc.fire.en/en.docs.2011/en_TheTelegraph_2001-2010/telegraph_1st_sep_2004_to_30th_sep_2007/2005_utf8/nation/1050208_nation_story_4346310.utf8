 Montek hope for Orissa

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 7: Deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, has hinted that Orissa will get a better deal from the 12th Finance Commission.

 Ahluwalia, who was here to attend the valedictory function of the eighth national conference on e-governance, said backward states like Orissa would benefit if recommendations of the finance commission were accepted by Parliament.

 He held talks with chief minister Naveen Patnaik, his cabinet colleagues and senior government officers on Saturday.

 The government made a strong case before Ahluwalia for special financial assistance from the Centre. Making a presentation, finance secretary U. Sarat Chandran said the state has not been suitably compensated even after achieving the target set by the 11th Finance Commission. 

 While the state?s revenue exceeded the assessment made by the 11th commission by Rs 1,334 crore during 2000-2005, its tax share from the Centre fell short by Rs 3,481 crore.

 The government lost Rs 7,500 crore on account of over-assessment of miscellaneous grant-in-aid receipt and under-assessment of pension and interest liability. What is needed is protection against lower central devaluation, Sarat Chandran pointed out.

 The finance secretary said Orissa has sustained a loss of Rs 700 crore till 2004 as royalty on major minerals was not revised on time. Non-tax revenue of the state in 2003-04 was Rs 1,095 crore and 50 per cent of it came from royalty on major minerals.

 Ahluwalia suggested that fiscal and governance reforms, undertaken by the Orissa government, should continue till the financial condition improves.

 He promised to take up the state?s infrastructure needs with the Centre keeping in view the industrialisation initiatives of the government.

 Ahluwalia reportedly assured Patnaik that the Centre will include Phulbani in the backward district initiative and said the state will benefit from funds under the Sam Vikash Yojana.

 He said the discussion also focused on the state?s infrastructure development, special assistance to the Koraput-Bolangir-Kalahandi region under the revised long-term action plan and foreign investment in the mineral-based industries sector.

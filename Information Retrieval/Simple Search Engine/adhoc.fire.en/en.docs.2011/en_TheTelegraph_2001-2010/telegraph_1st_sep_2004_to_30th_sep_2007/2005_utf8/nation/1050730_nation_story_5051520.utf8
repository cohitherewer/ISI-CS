 Ally raises pitch of dissent

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 29: The CPM politburo began its two-day meeting today on a note of dissent against the United Progressive Alliance government.

 Senior politburo members indicated that the CPM is likely to play the role of an Opposition party more and more as the BJP ? the real political adversary ? is in disarray.

 The meeting of the top party leadership begins at a time when several fractious issues are staring the Left in the face. 

 The CPM has not been able to sort out its conflict with the Congress on divestment of Bhel. Left parties have been critical of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs stance during the US trip.

 Besides, the conflagration in Gurgaon between Haryana police and Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India workers has been the most recent point of conflict.

 The ball is in the governments court, said a CPM politburo member when asked what the stand will be on Bhel.

 The CPM did not expect the dispute to linger for so long. Party general secretary Prakash Karat had said much before the monsoon session began that the conflict would not spill over to the House.

 It has decided not to raise the issue inside Parliament but the matter is far from resolved. The CPM has said the 10 per cent divestment of Bhel shares is a violation of the common minimum programme. 

 The politburo will discuss the violation of the CMP, said politburo member Sitaram Yechury.

 Party MPs will raise the issue of the Prime Ministers US trip in both houses of Parliament, he said.

 CPM leaders have time and again stressed that the Left will act as a watchdog in Delhi. The politburo meeting currently in session will reinforce this strategy. 

 The CPM wants to play the dual role of keeping the UPA government in power and also being the Opposition to strip the BJP of any leverage it may hope to get in and outside Parliament.

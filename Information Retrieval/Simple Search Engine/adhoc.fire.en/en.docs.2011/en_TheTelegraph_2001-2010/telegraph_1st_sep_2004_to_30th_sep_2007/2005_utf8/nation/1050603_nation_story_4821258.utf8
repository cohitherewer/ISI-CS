 Bollywood letter on smoking ban

 Mumbai: A producers association, 

 which has leading names from the entertainment industry 

 as its members, has lambasted the government for its proposed 

 ban on on-screen smoking, reports our special correspondent.

 The Film and Television Producers Guild of India, which counts as its members film producers Yash Chopra, Karan Johar, Subhas Ghai and Rakesh Roshan and television producers UTV, Balaji Telefilms and Nimbus Communications, wrote a letter to Union information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy urging him to request the Union health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, to withdraw the decision.

 Given the fact that the Censor Board for Film Certification has laid down guidelines that are sufficient to tackle this issue, it is rather strange that this sudden high-handed decision has been clamped down on this industry, says a statement issued by the guild. 

 No film till date has stooped to glorify social evils like smoking and drinking, it said. The ban was being enforced based on the irrational notion that using cigarettes in films or serials encourages smoking among the audience. 

 In such a scenario, the directive of the health ministry would be of no consequence and the introduction of such a draconian step will only hamper the growth and development of the entertainment industry, it added.

 Plan to check sex ratio slide

 Chandigarh: The Rajiv Gandhi Foundation 

 has decided to launch a project, Smart Parenthood Campaign, 

 in Haryanas Kurukshetra district to spread awareness 

 on female foeticide and the states declining sex ratio, 

 reports our correspondent.

 This was decided at a meeting between the foundations health department in-charge, Shehnaz Akhtar, and chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday. 

 There has been a decline from 945 to 933 girls per 1,000 boys in the age group of up to 6 years from 1991 to 2001 at the all-India level. 

 Haryana had less than 860 girls for 1,000 boys. In Kurukshetra, the ratio stood at 770 for every 1,000 boys.

 It was felt that the real tragedy was that women themselves collaborated in the ghastly crime of killing girls, a Hooda aide said.

 The foundations top priority will be to spread awareness among women on the depleting sex ratio. It will also address issues like sex determination, female foeticide and reproductive health.

 Pakistan hits Baglihar bump

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: Pakistan?s bid to involve a ?third party? in the Baglihar project notwithstanding, the World Bank has made it clear that it is just a ?signatory and not a guarantor? to the Indus Water Treaty.

 The clarification was issued by the World Bank soon after Pakistan formally sought its intervention last week for appointing ?neutral experts? to see whether the treaty provision had been violated by India while building the project on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.

 The World Bank said ?neutral experts? could only be appointed only when both India and Pakistan agree. If they fail to do so, a ?third party? could be called in. But even the ?third party? needs the approval of both neighbours. 

 Moreover, both Delhi and Islamabad have to agree on the language to decide whether the troubling issue is only a ?difference? that merits appointment of ?neutral experts? or a ?dispute? that calls for setting up a court of arbitration.

 There are clear indications that the process ? of finalising neutral experts or a third party ? would be extremely long-drawn and time-consuming, which would leave India with ample time to complete the project by the end of next year.

 Early this month, ?technical teams? from both sides held detailed discussions in Delhi. But even after the fourth day, they failed to resolve their differences. 

 Pakistan claims the project is in violation of the Indus Water Treaty of 1960. India refutes the Pakistani charge and its demand to suspend work on the project.

 After days of posturing, Pakistan sought the World Bank?s intervention on January 18, asking it to appoint ?neutral experts?.

 The bank, however, said it would examine the request and follow ?the procedures? laid down by the treaty. 

 ?The World Bank is a signatory to the treaty for certain purposes. It is not a guarantor to the treaty,? a recent press statement from the bank said.

 The World Bank has also explained its role, saying ?the first step under the treaty is to resolve any ?question? through the Permanent Indus Commission itself. If the ?question? is not resolved, it becomes a ?difference? and is referred to a neutral expert, to be appointed by the two countries, or by a third party agreed upon by the two countries?.

 It added that ?in the absence of such an agreement, the appointment of the neutral experts would be made by the World Bank, in consultation with the two countries. The decision of the neutral experts on all matters within their competence shall be final and binding?.

 The statement further said that ?if the ?differences? do not fall within the mandate of the neutral expert, or if the neutral expert rules that the ?difference? should be treated as a ?dispute?, then a court of arbitration would be established under the treaty?. 

 The World Bank has a role in the establishment of such a court.

 From the bank?s statement it is clear that appointing ?two neutral experts? would not be an easy task.

 Both India and Pakistan would have major say in their appointments and would even have the right to express dissatisfaction over any one or both the experts. Even if the two countries agree on the ?neutral experts?, it could well be that the views expressed by both might not be the same.

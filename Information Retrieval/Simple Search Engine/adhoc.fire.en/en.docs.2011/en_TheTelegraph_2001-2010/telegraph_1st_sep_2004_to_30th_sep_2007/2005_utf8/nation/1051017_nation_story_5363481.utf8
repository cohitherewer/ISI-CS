 Pak copter crash

 Islamabad, Oct. 16 (Reuters): A Pakistan Army helicopter crashed in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir during a relief operation, killing all six soldiers on board, a military spokesman said today. 

 The Mi-17 helicopter crashed during daytime sometime on Saturday, when it went to provide relief items in some inaccessible areas in the Bagh Valley, Major General Shaukat Sultan said. When it was going to Haji Peer Pak, which is a very difficult mountainous area, we lost contact with it, he said.

 The debris of the helicopter was found at 1:30 am today, Sultan said and added that four of the soldiers killed in the crash were army officers.

 Happy minus RJD, sour over Soren 

 K. SUBRAHMANYA 

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Backroom strategists of the Congress are pleased that a tie-up with Laloo Prasad Yadav has not materialised in Bihar, but believe their party has made avoidable concessions to Shibu Soren in Jharkhand. 

 In its pre-poll assessment of the ?ground realities? in the two states made on the basis of field visits, the party?s department of policy planning and coordination is understood to have presented convincing reasons against a formal Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal alliance. 

 The assessment, conveyed to president Sonia Gandhi late last month as separate reports on the two states, says the ruling RJD is unpopular among almost all sections of the people, particularly the Muslims. The community, which constitutes over 15 per cent of the electorate, holds the key in as many as 70 Assembly seats.

 ?The Muslims are looking for an alternative to the RJD. They are looking to the Congress to provide that alternative. There is an opportunity for the party to revive its base across Bihar,? said a source. 

 However, the strategists are not impressed with the unofficial decision to field nominees in about 80 of the 243 Assembly seats in Bihar or with the party?s reluctance to forge a formal tie-up with Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party. 

 ?Such an alliance would have surely had a chance of being viewed as an alternative to the unpopular RJD. Besides, we could have fielded candidates in a majority of the seats,? the source said. 

 The planners are not surprised with the findings of the pre-poll The Telegraph-STAR News-AC Nielsen survey published today. ?The finding that a formal alliance of the Congress-LJP would adversely affect the poll prospects of the RJD and the BJP-Janata Dal (United) combine confirms our recommendation to the leadership,? one of them said. 

 If Sonia campaigns extensively for such an alliance, the poll outcome could shock rivals as she has become the most popular leader since giving up prime ministership, they said. 

 Though they are gloating about Bihar, the tacticians are displeased with the Jharkhand deal and are cribbing about concessions to Soren. They had suggested that the party ?must go in for alliance with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha? but were clear about contesting 45 of the 81 seats. 

 ?The Congress must lay strong claim for at least 45 seats? because there is a wave in Jharkhand in favour of the Congress,? the source said. 

 Moreover, the strategists believe the JMM is not very popular and its influence is limited to the Santhal Parganas and a couple of other districts.

 They had cautioned that an ?unpredictable? Soren could be lured to the BJP with the bait of chief ministership if his party won around 25 seats. They are thus perplexed with the decision to leave the single largest share of seats to the JMM. 

 Sonia?s political secretary Ahmed Patel spoke to Soren today about seats, but only to request swapping of five constituencies between the allies. The request follows threats from leaders like Thomas Hansda that they would quit if their seats were allocated to the allies. 

 Immolation bid

 The Congress? ticket distribution for the Haryana elections took an unpleasant turn when three youths from the state attempted to immolate themselves in front of the party headquarters. 

 The youths were among a crowd of party workers who were shouting slogans and demanding tickets for their leaders in Haryana.

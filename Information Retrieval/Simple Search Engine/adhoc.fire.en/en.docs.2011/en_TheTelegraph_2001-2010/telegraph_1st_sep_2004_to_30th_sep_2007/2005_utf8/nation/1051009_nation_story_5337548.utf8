 Naga killings put ceasefire under strain

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Bangkok, Oct. 8: The fragile peace in the Naga areas is teetering on the brink of collapse once again after eight years of ceasefire. 

 Thuingaleng Muivah, the general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), seems to be finding it difficult to create adequate space for peace talks. He is coming under pressure from his cadre to revoke the ceasefire even as the Naga people who want the peace process to succeed are also beginning to lose hope. 

 If the Nagas know how to seek peace, they also know how to fight. India should know this from its experience of last 50 years. It is the Government of India which is breaking the ceasefire and we are compelled to accept it, Muivah said grimly.

 His reaction came in the wake of the cold-blooded killing of three NSCN (I-M) cadre and two civilians in Shillong. They were shot in custody after allegedly being arrested and tortured by Meghalaya police. 

 When I meet Oscar Fernandes and Padmanabhaiah, I will ask them what kind of peace we are seeking when the ground reality is so ugly, Muivah said. He, along with his senior party colleagues, is scheduled to meet Indian negotiators Oscar Fernandes and K. Padmanabhaiah beginning tomorrow to take the peace process forward.

 The Shillong incident comes in a series of unpleasant, and perhaps avoidable, clashes between the NSCN (I-M) cadre and Indian security forces. 

 Twelve armed men of the organisation were killed while they were camping at a site in the North Cachar hills and their location had been notified to the Indian side.

 According to Muivah, they were rounded up from their camp deep in the jungle, lined up in a row and shot after being told that there was no ceasefire there.

 In Chandel, Manipur, he said, 13 of his men were killed in an ambush and their bodies mutilated by Manipur State Commandos. Another four were killed on the Assam-Nagaland border and once again their bodies were mutilated, Muivah claimed.

 The Naga leader said he appreciated the fact that no ceasefire was ever perfect but pointed out: In the name of imperfection, we cannot tolerate deliberate and brutal violations as we have been witnessing.

 The Nagas are aghast at such brutality. What is amazing is that so far no Indian government or civil society organisation, including the National Human Rights Commission, has condemned these acts, Muivah said.

 Muivah asked whether it was wrong for the Nagas to then assume that they were dealing with people with double standards. 

 He said: We Nagas believe in peace because peace is what every human being needs and deserves. What are we to tell our people who are for peace when our children are being killed in this way?

 The Naga leader felt that a golden opportunity for peace was being frittered away by India when there was wholehearted support for peace among the Nagas. 

 Where is the will to peace on the Indian side? Muivah asked.

 He said the Nagas had honoured the ceasefire up to now. The casefire agreement was based on the principle that there should be no fighting any time anywhere between the two parties ? not in so-called Nagaland, not in Manipur, not in Assam, not in Arunachal and not even in Amsterdam, Bangkok or Delhi, for that matter.

 He said the Nagas had accepted this despite the intentional violation of the ceasefire by the Indian side. 

 But now we are forced to take stock of the situation. The Nagas are being compelled to decide on their own course of action. If we are being told that the ceasefire is not applicable everywhere, then so be it, he said.

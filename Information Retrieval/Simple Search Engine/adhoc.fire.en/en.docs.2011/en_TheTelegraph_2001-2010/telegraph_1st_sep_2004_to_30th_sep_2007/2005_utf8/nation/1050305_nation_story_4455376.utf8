 Gyanendra: Messy times

 New Delhi, March 4: On a day when King Gyanendra extended the house arrest of six senior political leaders of Nepal by another two months, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh reiterated that India was ?unambiguous? in its reaction to the developments there.

 New Delhi, he said, wanted an ?early restoration of democracy? and was committed to supporting all efforts aimed at restoring political stability and economic prosperity in the neighbouring country. 

 Making a statement in the Rajya Sabha, Singh also called for the immediate release of political leaders and lifting of press censorship. 

 Although the monarch has refused to heed New Delhi?s advice, Singh once again spelt out India?s views that multi-party democracy and constitutional monarchy were the twin pillars for stability and progress in Nepal.

 The minister singled out the ban on telecom services being provided by an Indian joint venture company ever since the king declared emergency. He also took note of the fact that several political leaders had crossed over to India and that parties in Nepal were planning to launch an agitation on March 8.

 India was in touch with the international community over the developments in Nepal in an effort to evolve a coordinated response, Singh said.

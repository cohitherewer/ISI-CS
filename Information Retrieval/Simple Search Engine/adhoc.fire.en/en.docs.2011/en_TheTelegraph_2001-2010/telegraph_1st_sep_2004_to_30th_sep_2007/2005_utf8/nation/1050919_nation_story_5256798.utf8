 NDA allies cry no tears

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: The BJPs allies, most of whom had come out in L.K. Advanis defence during last Mays Jinnah controversy, today reacted cautiously to his announcement of quitting the top job in December.

 From Bihar ally Janata Dal (United) to Trinamul Congress, Biju Janata Dal to Shiromani Akali Dal, every National Democratic Alliance partner described it as an internal matter of the BJP about which it had nothing to say.

 The Shiv Sena, which unlike the other allies had ripped into Advani over his Jinnah remarks, too said the matter was internal to the BJP.

 We have nothing to say about Advanijis decision to relinquish the key post, said Pankaj Banerjee, Trinamul spokesman. But in private, party leaders expressed reservations about Advani.

 Though Mamata refused to comment publicly, she was learnt to have told aides that her party, as a BJP ally, had suffered in both Assembly and municipality polls because of Advanis hawkish Hindutva.

 Many Trinamul leaders echoed that sentiment. Sultan Ahmed said a large number of Muslims did not vote for Trinamul because of Advanis Hindutva campaign.

 The NDA candidate for chief minister in Bihar, Nitish Kumar ? perhaps relieved that Advani would be leading the BJP during the October-November Assembly elections ? avoided any comment.

 The Dal (U) leader said his party had supported Advanis remarks on Jinnah because it was an ideological issue. It (Advanis announcement today) is not an ideological issue.

 Kumars party spokesman, Shambhu Srivastava, said, His (Advanis) decision to step down is an internal affair of the BJP. We do not want to comment on it.

 Biju Janata Dal leader Damodar Rout said: We have nothing to do with internal developments in the BJP.

 We do not meddle in internal affairs of other parties, said Shiromani Akali Dal leader Parkash Singh Badal.

 Laloo easy with seat slice

 Laloo Prasad: In poll mode

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: Leading a truncated UPA ? minus the Lok Janshakti Party and the CPI ? in the repeat Assembly elections in Bihar, Laloo Prasad Yadav is feeling more generous than he was six months ago.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal is likely to contest not more than 185 of the 243 seats this time, against the 215 it fought in the February-March polls. 

 At the end of two rounds of seat-sharing talks with allies Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and the CPM this afternoon, there were indications that Laloo Prasad may even be ready to settle for around 175 seats. The railway minister was tentatively scheduled to hold a third and final round of seat-sharing talks with his allies tonight. 

 Sources said that the RJD chief was willing to concede 42 seats to the Congress, which is asking for 53. The last time, he had offered a maximum of 35, prompting the Congress to fight the polls on its own. Laloo Prasad has offered eight seats to the NCP, which is seeking a dozen. The CPM wants to contest six seats but he has conceded four.

 After the two rounds, the Congresss chief poll manager Digvijay Singh said the talks were smooth and he hoped the deal would be sealed at the late night meeting.

 By and large, we have reached a broad understanding on the number of seats each party will contest and we have also identified the constituencies each party would fight, he said.

 According to Singh, the four allies are also collectively considering the best candidate for every constituency to maximise the chances of victory. The RJD and the Congress may each, therefore, have a say in the selection of candidates for constituencies allotted to the other. 

 The allies have also decided to announce their candidates for all 243 seats in one go.

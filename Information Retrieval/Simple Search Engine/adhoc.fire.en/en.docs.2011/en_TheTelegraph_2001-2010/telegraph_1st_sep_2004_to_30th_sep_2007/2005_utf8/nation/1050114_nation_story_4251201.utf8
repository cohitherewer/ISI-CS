 New Delhi, Jan. 13: The BJP, which until two days ago hadbragged its ticket distribution would be a ?cakewalk? unlike that of the rival camp, faced open rebellion by Bihar unit workers today.

 Sushil Modi, the Bhagalpur MP and the party?s Bihar kingpin for decades, was the first in the line of fire.

 He and Ravi Shankar Prasad had trotted out the line that the BJP-Janata Dal (United) alliance was firmly in place and this was ?enough? to alter the power dynamics in Bihar away from rival Laloo Prasad Yadav. The leadership line-up at Nitish Kumar?s house last Tuesday was meant to send out this message.

 But Modi?s detractors feared that deserving candidates were going to be ignored and descended today on the BJP headquarters at 11 Ashoka Road, where the party?s central election committee was meeting to finalise the list for the second phase of the polls.

 They had apparently got a whiff of the list of nominees recommended by the state leadership.

 The rag-tag turnout of workers from central Bihar not only showered Modi with a string of expletives and slanderous slogans but also accused the ?high command? of a ?sellout? to Laloo Prasad and Sonia Gandhi.

 Violence would have erupted if it were not for the special protection group deployed for Atal Bihari Vajpayee and BJP chief L.K. Advani?s security. The senior leaders were attending the poll meeting.

 One of the detractors charged Modi with trying to pass off as a backward caste leader when in ?reality, he is a Bania?. ?And true to the colour of a trader, he hawked away the tickets instead of giving them to bonafide aspirants,? a worker from Madhubani alleged.

 Modi ? who has the ?blessings? of Advani and his former political secretary K.N. Govindacharya ? had hoped to have his way in ticket distribution this time as well.

 Though Modi was directed to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Bhagalpur so as to shift him out of Patna, the incumbent state president, Gopal Narain Singh, is believed to be his ?lackey?. His detractors charged as much when they screamed: ?Modi, Gopal Narain ? Laloo ke dalal (middlemen)? and ?Sonia Gandhi ke chaprasi (servant)?.

 As the slogans got filthier, N. Sharma, personal secretary of Bihar in-charge Arun Jaitley, tried to calm the crowd. He was heckled and about to be roughed up when police whisked him away into Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi?s room.

 The infuriated party workers then shouted that if Sharma was a ?fighter and not a coward?, he should face them instead of ?slinking? away.

 Bradman cookie crumbles

 Sydney, Oct. 13 (AP): The family of the late Sir Donald Bradman is considering legal action to stop the cricket greats name from being used to market chocolate chip cookies in India.

 The Bradman Foundation earlier this week announced the former Australia captains name will be associated with a chocolate chip cookie to help raise funds for underprivileged children.

 It would mark the first time that the name of Bradman (picture above), who died on February 25, 2001, at the age of 92, is used on any food product.

 But the Bradman family released a statement today objecting to the endorsement deal. Sir Donald is a loved and missed family member, not a brand name like Mickey Mouse, the family said. Sir Donald would be adamant in his opposition to his use of his name. So is his family.

 The family said the foundation failed in its duty to safeguard the cricket legends image when it signed an agreement allowing Bangalore-based firm Unibic India to market the cookies.

 The foundation said it signed a deal with the cricket icon to use his name commercially. In its operations, the Bradman Foundation has at all times gone to great lengths to preserve the good name and reputation of the person acknowledged as the worlds greatest cricketer, the foundation said. 

 Trademarks have been registered and licensed to commercial organisations under strict quality control requirements imposed by the foundation.

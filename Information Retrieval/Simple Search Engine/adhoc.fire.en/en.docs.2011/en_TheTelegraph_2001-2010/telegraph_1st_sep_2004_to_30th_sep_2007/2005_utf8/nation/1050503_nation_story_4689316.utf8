 Isro boosts its launch power

 Sriharikota: It took five years to build 

 and cost about Rs 400 crore. But no one?s counting the money.

 Least of all the men whose eyes are forever fixed on the stars.

 Come Thursday morning, two satellites are set to blast off for different orbits from the glistening new second launch pad (SLP) here which scientists say will at least double the country?s space programme, reports our special correspondent.

 The scientists at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre here in Andhra Pradesh say the number of satellite launches could go up to four or six a year from the current average of two.

 ?Five years of hard work has gone into building the second launch pad at a total cost of about Rs 400 crore,? K. Narayan, the space centre?s director, told journalists visiting the complex today.

 Narayan said the ?state-of-the-art? complex is capable of ?accommodating all the vehicles? of the Indian Space Research Organisation and the ?advanced launch vehicles to be built in the next decade?.

 The launch has been fixed for 10.19 on May 5. The countdown will begin at 5.49 am tomorrow, Isro officials said.

 Uttaranchal quake warning 

 Chennai: A research team of Madras University?s 

 department of applied geology has predicted that an earthquake 

 will hit Uttaranchal on May 4, even as a theory is doing 

 the rounds that a powerful quake will rock the Himalayan 

 region by June, reports our special correspondent.

 ?On May 4, 2005, the Chamoli region in Uttaranchal will be shaken by an earthquake of a possible magnitude of 6.0 to 6.7 on the Richter scale,? senior research scholar N. Venkatanathan said. The prediction is based on the alignment of planets. The epicentre would probably lie ?26.5 km north-northeast of Chamoli?, claimed Venkatanathan in a paper, adding that the tremor would originate between 3 pm and 9 pm.

 However, the research team gave a ?buffer? of a day, indicating that the quake could hit any time between May 3 and May 5. It also gave a ?buffer? of a 30-km radius regarding the epicentre.

 Miracle baby on train

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): A newborn, delivered 

 in the toilet of a running train, slipped down through the 

 toilet hole but was later found alive on the tracks on Sunday.

A search was launched when the train stopped at Mansurpur. The child was found between Khatoli and Mansuri railway stations. 

 Killer drain

 Ahmedabad (PTI): A two-year-old child 

 died after he fell into an open drain in the Vatva area. 

 Subam Jat?s father found a body when he went to close the 

 drain outside his house. When the body was fished out, the 

 father discovered it was his child?s.

 Scavenger aid

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court, coming 

 to the rescue of human scavengers, has asked the Centre 

 and states to prepare within six months time-bound plans 

 to eliminate the ?pernicious and obnoxious? practice. A 

 bench of Justices S.N. Variava and H.K. Sema in their order 

 said: ?If manual scavenging is still being resorted to, 

 then the department or corporation should indicate with 

 details what scheme it has for eliminating it and for rehabilitating 

 the persons concerned and within what time frame.?

 Immolation bid

 Mumbai (PTI): Three employees of 

 Dhule municipal corporation were held for making a self-immolation 

 bid in front of the mantralaya on Sunday. The trio, along 

 with 91 others, was laid off by the civic body because of 

 excess numbers in staff, police said. Later, 34 others were 

 reinstated. The trio was demanding that they too be reinstated 

 and had come to meet the officials concerned. 

 Lightning deaths

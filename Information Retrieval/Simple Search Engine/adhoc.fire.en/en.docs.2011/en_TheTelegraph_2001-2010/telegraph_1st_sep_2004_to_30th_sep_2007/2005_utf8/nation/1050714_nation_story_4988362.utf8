 Terror talk back on Pak table

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, July 13: Stopping just short of blaming Pakistan for the militant attack in Ayodhya, India today said such incidents will have a negative impact on the ongoing peace process.

 I am not saying this or that incident but such attacks will have a negative impact on the peace process, foreign secretary Shyam Saran said this evening. 

 He pointed out that terrorist camps across the Line of Control continue to exist and the terror infrastructure there remains intact.

 Sarans remarks come three days before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is to leave for Washington for his summit meeting with US President George W. Bush.

 The foreign secretary said the fight against global terrorism will be one of the major topics on the agenda for talks between Singh and Bush. 

 Referring to the attack in Ayodhya and the blasts in London, Saran said such incidents show there can be no segmentation in the fight against terror.

 The foreign secretary argued that the peace process between India and Pakistan can only be taken forward by expanding the constituency for peace on both sides. 

 Saran felt that the US and the international community can help by making it clear to the concerned sections that terrorism needed to be fought seriously and without discrimination.

 A US official earlier in the day said the Bush administration was rolling out the red carpet for Singhs visit as it will also reflect the strength of Indo-US ties. He said: India is of an increasing strategic importance to the US.

 India and the US, being two largest democracies in the world, can work together on a number of areas for the promotion of democracy and also in fighting terrorism, checking proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, the official added.

 Back home, the Left parties have been watching the growing Indo-US ties with concern. Even today, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat expressed apprehensions that India, in its keenness to build stronger ties with the US, may compromise on its sovereign policy.

 Realising that this can snowball into yet another controversy between the government and the Left, Saran said: Indias foreign policy was non-aligned in the past and will remain so in future.

 Koirala seeks support

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 12: Nepali Congress leader Girija Prasad Koirala, who is now in New Delhi meeting political and government leaders, has urged India to shape a Nepal policy that will support democratic forces.

 At an informal meeting this evening with Nepali leaders in exile and Indian political leaders ? CPIs D. Raja, Jaya Jaitley of the Samata Party and the Lok Janshakti Partys Ram Vilas Paswan were there ? the former Prime Minister of Nepal said: In shaping its Nepal policy, India must decide whether it will give help and encouragement to democratic forces or to a dictator (the king).

 He said since the kings dismissal of Parliament and overthrow of the government on February 1, there has been a campaign in Kathmandu to discredit Indias role by raising the issue of interference in the internal affairs of Nepal.

 But, he said, democracy and human rights cannot be restricted by borders. Just as democrats the world over condemn the junta in Myanmar for detaining dissident leader Aung San Su Kyi, it was important that they support the parliamentary parties against the monarch of Nepal.

 Koirala said he was unwilling to talk at length on Nepal sitting here in India because that can be an embarrassment for the Indian government. However, the relationship between the people of Nepal and India has thrived irrespective of governments.

 In Nepal, the struggle currently is between the forces of modernity and the forces of feudalism. The world has become interconnected and a global village but the monarch of Nepal is swimming against the current of time with his tyrannical reign, Koirala said.

 Koirala said he was on the last leg of his political career but he had helped establish democracy in Nepal in the past and on his return to Kathmandu he would continue with the movement for popular rule.

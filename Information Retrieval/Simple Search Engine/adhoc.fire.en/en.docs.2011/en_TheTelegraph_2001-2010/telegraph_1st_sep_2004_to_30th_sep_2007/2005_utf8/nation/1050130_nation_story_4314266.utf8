 Goa trouble

 Panaji, Jan. 29 (PTI): The Manohar Parrikar-led BJP government in Goa is in trouble with three of its MLAs resigning from the Assembly and two withdrawing support. 

 The day started with Atanasio Monserratte, who had resigned from the government yesterday after he was stripped of the town and country planning portfolio, and two other BJP MLAs sending their resignations. 

 The Congress, meanwhile, has staked claim to form a government but the chief minister said the BJP would be given an opportunity to prove its majority.

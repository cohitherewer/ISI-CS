 Trust call to speed up aid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 15: Former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh and concerned citizens of India and Pakistan have appealed to the two governments to ease restrictions on non-government organisations wanting to give relief to the quake victims in Kashmir.

 The relief effort... of India and Pakistan needs to build a lot more mutual trust and respect for mutual sensibilities and sensitivities so that the relief and rehabilitation work is better than any other part of the world, Singh said in a message today. 

 I only wish that our composite dialogue should have proceeded at a faster pace. Let us not slow our pace on the confidence-building measures.

 Singh was to participate in a programme by concerned citizens of India and Pakistan here today to organise relief efforts on either side of the Line of Control, but was in hospital for dialysis.

 Peoples initiatives have special significance when it comes to helping people in Kashmir, as there is the harsh fact of alienation of some sections of people, he wrote to the organisers.

 The Pakistan-India Peoples Forum for Peace and Democracy (PIPFD) spokesperson, Tapan Bose, said the forum was setting up a centre in Delhi and field offices in Srinagar and Lahore. It was appealing for appropriate relief. 

 Bose said the state government had appointed Bharat Vyas as the co-ordinator for NGO relief activity in Kashmir. Only the military on the Indian side was involved in relief and rescue efforts. The civil administration was feeble.

 PM appeal

 Prime Minister Manmohan singh today appealed to all employees of the central government and central public sector undertakings to contribute a days salary towards relief and rehabilitation work.

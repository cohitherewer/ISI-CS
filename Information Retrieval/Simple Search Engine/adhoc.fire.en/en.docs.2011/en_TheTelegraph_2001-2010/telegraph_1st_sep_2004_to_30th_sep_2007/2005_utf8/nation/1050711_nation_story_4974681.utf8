 Beeline for Amarnath amid tight security

 Chandanwari, July 10 (Reuters): Deep in the Himalayas in trouble-torn Kashmir, soldiers and police personnel on the banks of a roaring stream frisk Lalit Tigri, a sadhu on crutches.

 Hundreds of devotees queue up behind him, passing through metal detectors before being body-searched and their belongings X-rayed by security personnel.

 Thousands of pilgrims chanting hymns began the annual trek this weekend to the Amarnath cave.

 The old and the infirm ride ponies and palanquins while the rich fly in in helicopters to the shrine, situated about 13,500 feet above sea level.

 Anything is worth for a glimpse of Bhole Baba, 40-year-old Tigri, who lost his leg in an accident, said. As long as I have His blessings, Im not scared. He will protect us.

 Although the peace process in place between India and Pakistan in the past 20 months has helped ease tension, safety concerns for the pilgrims have gone up after unidentified militants last week attacked the disputed site in Ayodhya.

 Authorities in Jammu and Kashmir have deployed tens of thousands of soldiers along a treacherous 50-km mountain track that takes pilgrims along icy streams, glacier-fed lakes and through snow-covered mountain passes.

 I am satisfied over the security grid put in place but extra vigilance is needed to ensure an incident free yatra for the third consecutive year, said governor S.K. Sinha, who heads the Amarnath pilgrimage board.

 Nearly 100,000 pilgrims have made the trip in the past 20 days, officials said. A record 400,000 people visited in 2004.

 The shrine was discovered by a Muslim shepherd, Adam Malik, centuries ago. His descendants still receive a share of cash and other offerings made by devotees.

 Soldiers, most of them in battle fatigues, guard the route to the cave and many with sniffer dogs comb the muddy track for mines. A little security lapse can result in disaster. They (militants) are desperate, said Ramesh Kumar, a Border Security Force official.

 Officials say violence has declined due to the peace process, but people are still killed in daily gunbattles and bombings.

 Death is destined, said pilgrim D.P. Singla.I can die in an accident in Chandigarh. Better have a glimpse of the Lord than worry about your life.

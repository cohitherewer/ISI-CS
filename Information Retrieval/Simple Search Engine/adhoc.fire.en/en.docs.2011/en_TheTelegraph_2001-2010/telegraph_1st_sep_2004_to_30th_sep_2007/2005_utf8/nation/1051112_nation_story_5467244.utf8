 New Delhi, Nov. 11: The directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) has issued alert notices against Andaleeb Sehgal, his business partner in their trading firm Hamadan Exports, Vikas Dhar, and the latters father Vijay Dhar in connection with the oil-for-food scam, Enforcement Directorate sources have said.

 A DRI alert is issued to prevent an individual from leaving the country as he may be wanted in connection with a matter under investigation by government agencies.

 The name of Vijay Dhar, reportedly an adviser in the erstwhile Rajiv Gandhi government, has figured in the probe for the first time.

 Sources in the Enforcement Directorate said the DRI is now collating and analysing data gathered from the questioning of Andaleeb and Vikas. 

 The DRI and other agencies would also sift through the data that has come from the investigations in the last few days. Various aspects, including under-invoicing, if any, by Hamadan Exports and any other associate company, will be examined through agencies in India and abroad, an Enforcement Directorate source said.

 The investigating authorities are also not ruling out the existence of other firms promoted by the same individuals. The tax evasion aspect has assumed significance, sources said. This will be particularly important if any clues are found about any hawala transactions.

 The telephone calls made from the firms telephone and from their individual phones are being verified thoroughly. It is also being examined whether satellite phones were used and whether they had bypassed the normal network of VSNL, the then carrier of international telephone calls, a source said.

 The Volcker report says that Hamadan Exports allegedly paid an amount of $748,450 as illegal surcharge to the erstwhile Saddam Hussein regime.

 Sources said the investigating authorities are now examining whether any contravention of the Foreign Exchange Management Act took place. They indicated that the questioning is expected to continue as issues pertaining to multiple regulatory agencies ? the RBI, the Income-tax department and Enforcement Directorate ? are involved.

 The income-tax returns ? both individual as well as those of Hamadan Exports ? are being examined in the context of the claims made by the Volcker report.

 Enforcement Directorate sources said the DRI may also seek information from its counterparts in other countries, particularly in the Middle East and Europe, if any discrepancies are noticed.

 The DRI functions as the liaison authority for exchange of information with other countries on revenue evasion and maintains statistics of seizures.

 15-minutes under ?different? therapy

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Kalam: Fine 

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: For about 15 minutes this morning, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was put under general anaesthesia at the Army Research and Referral Hospital as doctors went in for a ?different kind of orthopaedic treatment? instead of surgery to set his fractured shoulder.

 ?Today morning, under short general anaesthesia, closed reduction of the fracture has been done. His Excellency had uneventful recovery and is cheerful. His condition is fine,? Major General L.P. Sadhotra, the commandant of the hospital, said.

 According to orthopaedic surgeons, closed reduction involves externally administered treatment to close the gap created by the fracture ? a procedure painful enough to require short general anaesthesia.

 Kalam had fractured his right shoulder yesterday after a fall in the herbal garden he has set up in Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Last evening, doctors at the army hospital had advised minor surgery for quick rehabilitation after an X-ray confirmed a ?minor fracture?. 

 But today, a panel of military and civil orthopaedic surgeons decided against surgery. ?The doctors treating him preferred a different kind of orthopaedic treatment to surgery,? Rashtrapati Bhavan sources said.

 ?This procedure is sufficient now. Tomorrow, the panel of doctors will again examine His Excellency, only then it can be known what time he can be discharged and how much rest he will need,? the commandant said.

 Sources said Kalam was interacting with the doctors soon after the conclusion of the medical procedure. ?He (Kalam) is absolutely fine and progressing well. The President is talking to visitors and officials who called on him to enquire about his health,? Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson S.M. Khan told PTI tonight.

 In the evening, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited the hospital and called on the President. Singh wished him speedy recovery. Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and former President R. Venkatraman also called on Kalam. 

 Although the sources said the President would be back in Rashtrapati Bhavan ?early?, Kalam is expected to defer his scheduled visit to tsunami-hit areas from February 11. ?It is under review,? the sources said.

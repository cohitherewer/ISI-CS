The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 In the market, murky or not, competition is king

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, April 3: In the new red light zones in Worli, a group of Bengali women is being charged with taking away the livelihood of others.

 Some of the women ? both from Bangladesh and Bengal ? who live together in their hutments as brothel workers, have been here for more than 10 years. But their numbers increased dramatically over the past two or three years, with a heavy influx of Bengali women into the city. In one brothel alone, Bengalis total 100.

 This has set the women from other regions against the Bengalis, who are accused of various kinds of malpractices and unethical behaviour.

 Marwari Chawl is more tolerant. Though its original residents were Kannadigas and Maharashtrians ? the Nepalis have disappeared significantly from Mumbai?s sex districts following media attention on them ? Bengali women land up there and rent rooms without much problem.

 In the adjacent red light zone in the area in B.D.D. Chawl, dominated by Kannadigas who have always been the largest group of sex workers in the city, there is no sign saying that Bengalis are not allowed.

 But the women who live there, about 75 per cent of them Kannadigas, say it quite clearly.

 ?We will not allow any Bengali to come here,? says Shardabai, an articulate Kannadiga in her late 30s, attired in the traditional cotton sari with a border, a fiery red bindi with a thin line of black under it shining on her forehead.

 She also wears a mangalsutra and lots of gold jewellery, like the other women in her quarters. It is, ironically, almost a matriarchal set- up ? and the women look strong, forceful and assertive.

 ?Look at us and look at them. We wear respectable clothes. We always wear saris and keep ourselves clean,? she says. ?But they wear all sorts of clothes, even pants and short skirts,? she adds. ?They also eat fish and chicken and mutton all the time. Some of us also eat these things, but not all the time.?

 ?Most important, we throw out customers when they refuse to use condoms. But the Bengalis are greedy and will do anything to oblige their customers. That is why very few men come this way. The Bengalis have taken them away from us with their bad habits,? Shardabai adds. She came here 15 years ago.

 Because the business is so bad, many of them are thinking of packing their bags and going back to Karnataka in search of another livelihood, says Shantabai.

 The Bengalis in Marwari Chawl ? who do show much more diversity in clothing, dressed in skirts or salwar kurtas more than in saris ?angrily refute the charges.

 ?We never agree to accept a customer who does not use a condom. We have our men to throw them out,? says Rehana, who says she has come from Ranaghat.

 ?It is the other women who make our lives tough. While they pay next to nothing for their rooms here, with some of them having bought rooms here, too, we pay a rent of at least Rs 100 per day to the landlord?s men,? she adds.

 Many haven?t seen the landlords. ?Sometimes we have to pay Rs 4,000 as rent,? adds Nusrut Biwi. 

 ?And now it does not happen so often because they have been forced to accept us. But earlier, there would be very frequent fights when a customer left one of them and approached a Bengali woman.?

 ?We don?t have to do anything extra to lure customers,? Nusrut asserts with a smile.

 ?We don?t bargain. If they give us Rs 60, we accept. But the others will always try to extract some more,? she says.

 ?It may be their desperation, which is more than for the others, for which they perhaps don?t negotiate with customers, either on safe sex or prices, or their different looks. But it is true that the demand for Bengali women is always going up,? says Aishwarya Sengupta of Social Activities Integration, an NGO that works for HIV-prevention in Mumbai?s red light districts.

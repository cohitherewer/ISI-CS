The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Centre, Left in silent pact

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 20: The UPA and its Left allies have reached an unstated understanding not to tread on each others toes so that peaceful co-existence in the coalition is not threatened.

 The governments latest decision to hike oil prices and the Lefts predictable response reinforce the understanding. Left leaders said they would protest in and outside Parliament but matters would be kept on a leash even if trade unions wanted to adopt a more strident stand.

 The Left will criticise the governments economic policies but the criticism will be restricted to words and not cascade into political action. The Left is clear it does not want to make any move that may destabilise the government.

 The governments strategy is that it will push through contentious economic policies only after several rounds of discussions so that the Left cannot fault it with not having consulted them.

 Todays oil price hike came after the government held long-drawn discussions with the Left at several levels over months. Not only petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met the Left leaders at a series of meetings.

 At the end, both the government and the Left did what they had to do. The government hiked prices and the Left issued a statement threatening nation-wide protests. But the leaders know these protests will remain confined to their strongholds, Bengal and Kerala.

 In the coming days, the government and the Left will go through similar motions over FDI in retail and the implementation of the 2003 electricity act.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has said the Lefts objections have not deterred the government from pushing through reforms. Only those policies are being kept on hold where laws have to be passed or amended.

 The government has kept on hold the insurance regulatory authority bill that seeks to increase FDI limit in insurance. 

 The only reason is the Lefts point-blank refusal to support it in Parliament. The BJP, too, is opposed to the bill.

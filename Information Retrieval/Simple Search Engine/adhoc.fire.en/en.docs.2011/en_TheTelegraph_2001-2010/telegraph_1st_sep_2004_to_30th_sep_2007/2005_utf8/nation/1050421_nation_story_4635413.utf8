 Red fear ?boon? for big cats

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, April 20: Tigers in Chhattisgarh have Naxalite ?friends? to thank for their rising numbers.

 The ban imposed by the Communist Party of India (Maoist) on poaching seems to have worked wonders for the big cats. ?No doubt, tigers in Chhattisgarh are safe in Maoist hands. Their population at the Indravati sanctuary in the Naxalite-affected Bastar region is increasing every year. the rebels are indirectly assisting the forest department in wildlife protection and conservation by imposing a ban on all illegal activities inside the forest,? chairman of the state forest development corporation, R.K. Sharma, told The Telegraph. 

 Sharma, who conducted the last census survey as additional chief conservator of forests (wildlife), said the number of tigers spotted in the sanctuary was 29 in 2002, 35 in 2003 and 39 last year. 

 The current additional chief conservator of forests (wildlife), N.K. Bhagat, said the tiger population has further increased and the exact number would be out after the 2005 census survey is completed.

 While the presence of Naxalites seems to have kept tigers safe, it has also hampered census surveys and come in the way of tourism. 

 President of the Bastar wildlife society Sharad Verma said: ?Since the Maoists allow the census officials to go till a particular point, the findings cannot be taken as accurate. The Indravati sanctuary, spread over 1,200 sq km in Dantewada district, is a stronghold of Maoists and was included in Project Tiger in 1984.? 

 ?The actual tiger population could be around 50 at Indravati,? he added.

 Elaborating on the influence of the rebels, Verma said, ?The fear of Maoists not only keeps poachers away from the sanctuary but also forces forest officials to take their permission before entering the forest.? 

 Tourism is another casualty, Bhagat feels. ?Though the Indravati sanctuary is the perfect place to watch wildlife, which includes leopards, neelgais, barking deer and tigers, its potential cannot be realised,? he added. 

 Forest employees, on the other hand, do not complain as they feel the Maoists are playing the role of protectors effectively. ?No poacher will dare enter Indravati sanctuary,? an official said.

 A senior police official said, ?The rebels have their own compulsion to look after the wildlife and environment. For, the forest will remain a safe haven as long as it is free from the movement of outsiders, including employees of the department.?

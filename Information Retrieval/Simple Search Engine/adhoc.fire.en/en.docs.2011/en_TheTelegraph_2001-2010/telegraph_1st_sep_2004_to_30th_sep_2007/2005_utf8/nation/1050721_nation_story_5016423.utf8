 Driving around Delhi, raping

 - After college student, its housewifes turn

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 20: The capital of rape has lived up to its ignoble reputation with chilling consistency: another woman was dragged into a car in Delhi today and gangraped while being driven around the city.

 The 23-year-old resident of a jhuggi in Mayapuri, in southwest Delhi, had gone to answer natures call in an open field with two other women at 4.30 am when four men drove up in a white Maruti.

 Three of them got out to grab the housewife while the fourth stayed at the wheel. The women with the victim tried to pull her free, but were beaten up. 

 As the car sped away with the woman, they rushed back to the jhuggi to inform her family, who went to the police.

 The men drove around the city raping her. Two hours later, she was dropped off near Saraswati Vihar in northwest Delhi, about 15 km from where she was abducted, police said. 

 When the police control room van found her, the woman was in such a state of shock that she could not tell the police her name. Finally, she wrote her name and address on a piece of paper. 

 The victim was taken to a hospital where a medical examination confirmed rape, the police said. She could not reveal much about the identity of the rapists, they added.

 The victim hails from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh and has been living in Delhi for the past three years. Her husband makes a meagre living out of making plastic packaging boxes.

 On May 8, a college student had been abducted from Dhaula Kuan in south Delhi and gangraped in a moving Santro. The Delhi University student, who came from Shillong, was on her way to a paratha stall near her house with a friend when she was kidnapped. 

 The men had raped her as they drove from south to east Delhi, even changing the car in between. 

 The police came under severe criticism for failing to catch the culprits immediately although her friend had informed them on a cellphone minutes after the kidnapping. One of the accused, who turned out to be a driver with a Gurgaon BPO, was later caught and identified by the girl but three others are still at large.

 We have registered a case and investigations are on, was all deputy commissioner of police (southwest district) R.S. Yadav said today. 

 The police have detained few persons for questioning but there is no concrete evidence linking the two rapes except that the modus operandi was similar. 

 After todays incident, Delhi Polices claims of improved patrolling since the May 8 rape sound hollow. The crime was committed even as the police safety guide for women issued in the public interest handed out advice like Keep a mobile handy or Do not take deserted short cuts.

 Women in the national capital have to live with the fear that a rapist could strike any time ? while responding to a medical emergency, buying something to eat, going to see a film or just going to answer natures call.

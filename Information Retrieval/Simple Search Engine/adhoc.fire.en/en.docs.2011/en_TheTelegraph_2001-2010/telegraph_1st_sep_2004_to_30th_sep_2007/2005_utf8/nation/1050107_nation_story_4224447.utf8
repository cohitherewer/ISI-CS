Tremors

 Car Nicobar, Jan. 6: (PTI): A 14-year-old boy survived on a tree-top for 10 days without food or water.

 Class VII student Muralidhar, who is from Tamil Nadu, climbed a tree when the tsunami lashed the island on December 26. He did not get down from the tree for 10 days out of fear, Dr C.B. Sathaye, who treated him, said today. His parents have been informed. 

 ?We injected fluid immediately and he was taken to Port Blair and admitted to the naval hospital,? he said. 

 Miami (AP): US law enforcement officials say persons claiming to represent tsunami relief organisations are using e-mails and telephone calls in an attempt to steal donations. Enforcement officials alerted residents after they learned of an e-mail purportedly sent by a British group called ?The Foundation for Victims of Flood and Earthquake? and another requesting aid to the ?Tsunamis Disaster Help Funds.?

 Bangkok (AFP): Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who lost a grandson in the tsunami, has ordered that three local dogs be sent to the affected regions to sniff for bodies because they will be more effective than foreign canines, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said on Thursday.

 Bangkok (AFP): A restaurant called Tsunami, which opened in October 2004, is sticking to its name. ?We have no plans to change the name as we picked it months before the tragedy,? said an official of the Japanese restaurant at the JW Marriott Hotel here.

 Srinagar: The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front on Thursday organised a blood donation camp in Maisuma locality for the tsunami affected, reports our correspondent. A hundred pints of blood and Rs 1 lakh had been collected by late afternoon at the camp in which JKLF volunteers and donors, including Hindus and Sikhs, participated.

Port Blair (PTI): A group of 43 volunteers is offering Guru 

Ravi Shankar?s Art of Living meditation courses to tsunami survivors in six relief 

camps across the island to overcome their trauma and rebuild their lives. ?The 

courses we now offer are of 15 minutes, but people are clamouring for courses 

of a longer duration,? said a volunteer.

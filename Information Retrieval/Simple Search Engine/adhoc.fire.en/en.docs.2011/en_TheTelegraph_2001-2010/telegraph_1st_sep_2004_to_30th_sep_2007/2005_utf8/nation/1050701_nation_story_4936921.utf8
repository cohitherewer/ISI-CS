 Watchdog for judges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 30: With the judiciary not too keen on including itself within the ambit of the Lok Pal Bill, the government is drafting a legislation to make judges keep tabs on their colleagues. 

 According to the draft of the Judges Inquiry Bill, a national judicial council will be created to look into complaints against judges.

 Consisting of the Chief Justice of India and the two senior-most judges of the Supreme Court and high courts, the council will examine all complaints relating to corruption and mismanagement in the judiciary. 

 In case the complaint is against a member of the council, the judge next in line will look into them. 

 The public will not have access to the councils investigations. 

 A code of conduct for judges will be in place and they will need to disclose their financial assets.

 Seamans kin smell a rat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 5: The family members of Rajib Lahiri, the second officer of the ill-fated MV Faiz, alleged that there could be a conspiracy behind the fire that engulfed the ship but left 800 tonnes of cargo intact, even as the Coast Guard stepped up its search for the missing officer.

 We have spoken to several survivors and each version of the circumstances leading to my sons alleged dive into the sea has been totally different. We demand a probe into the matter immediately, said Chayna, the missing officers mother.

 It has been nearly a week, but the Lahiris have not lost hope of Raja, as he is affectionately known in the family, returning.

 One seaman told us that Raja was asked to loosen the hook holding the lone lifeboat when he jumped into the sea. Others have given different versions. One person told us that Raja was fast asleep when the fire began to spread and jumped into the sea immediately after realising the ship was ablaze, said sister Mou Acharya.

 Only a probe will reveal the truth and I hope that something will come out of it, Mou said.

 It is also strange that Ashok Sen, the first officer who relieved captain P.P. Shelly, did not have the time to radio any message or send distress signals. The crew could have at least tried to save Shellys family and nine-year-old Lubin, who was sleeping on the bridge, Chayna said.

 Chayna and Mou, accompanied by friends, went to the Dum Dum police station today to lodge a complaint against the ships officials, but could not do so as the police do not have the authority to take such complaints.

 However, the ships owner-cum-managing director, Pervez Rehman, said he would help shipping authorities during the formal inquiry into the mishap that will start soon.

 As this is a marine casualty case, shipping authorities will definitely conduct an inquiry and that will reveal everything. There is no force on earth that can stall the inquiry, Rehman said. 

 I have nothing personal against the crew and they must also understand it, he said. I have received news that the cargo has miraculously survived the blaze, but I hope that they (the Coast Guard) find Rajib Lahiri soon. He was a fine officer.

 Coast Guard officials are still looking for the missing officer. We have expanded our search operation to almost 200 nautical miles. It is extremely difficult to continue the search operation as the sea is now very rough, but we have not lost hope, said G. Singh, the commanding officer at the Haldia Coast Guard station.

 A Dornier aircraft has been pressed into service and is scanning 180 nautical miles in an hour.

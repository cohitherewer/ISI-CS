 Vedanta loses interest in land

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 29: The Vedanta issue has taken a new turn with the company writing to the Orissa government that it does not need the 58.93 hectares of forestland in Kalahandi district to mine bauxite for its alumina refinery project.

 The acquisition of forestland has been at the centre of a controversy with the central empowered committee of the Supreme Court seeking clarifications from the Union ministry of forests and environment on alleged violation of norms by Vedanta. 

 In its last hearing on February 28, the CEC had taken a tough stand on the basis of a report filed by a fact-finding team, which visited Vedanta?s project site near Lanjigarh in Kalahandi.

 Vedanta Alumina had entered into an agreement with the state-owned Orissa Mining Corporation to explore the Niyamgiri mines allotted to it.

 With Vedanta feeling the heat, the company does not seem to be interested in the land any longer. ?Although letting go of the forestland is not very cost-effective, we do not want more controversies. Now, we have to change the layout of the refinery,? said Debashish Roy, associate vice-president of the proposed project. 

 He further said the company has not violated forest norms. ?We have not technically violated the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 although construction activities that we have carried out have not been strictly in line with the guidelines of the ministry of forests and environment,? Roy added.

 Acting swiftly, the government on Sunday informed the Union ministry of forests and environment of Vedanta?s decision. The ministry then recalled the permission sought by the Naveen Patnaik government for construction on village forestland. 

 The CEC today fixed April 8 as the next date of hearing after the government submitted its replies on certain important issues. 

 In its February hearing, the CEC had observed that environmental clearance was granted under the false premise that no forestland was involved in the refinery project.

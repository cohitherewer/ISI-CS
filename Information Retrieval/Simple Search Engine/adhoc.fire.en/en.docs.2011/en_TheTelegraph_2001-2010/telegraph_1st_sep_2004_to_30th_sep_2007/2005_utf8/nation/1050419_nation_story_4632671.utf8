 Scanner on defence affidavits

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 18: The Supreme Court today took a serious note of ?inconsistencies? in affidavits filed by the Union government on defence procurements for the Kargil war and observed that it was for the government to initiate ?whatever action it deems fit?. 

 One of the affidavits was perceived to have given a clean chit to former defence minister George Fernandes on the issue while the other referred over 20 purchases to the CBI and promised action against him, if found guilty.

 A division bench said ?either the government does it (initiate action) on its own or, if necessary, we will pass appropriate orders?. The next hearing will be held in early July.

 after the court?s summer vacation.

 The comptroller and auditor general of India had in its report last year raised serious objections on the manner of procurement in about 35 purchases, out of which 23 have now gone to the CBI for probe. The other 12 have already come under the probe of the investigating agency.

 Apart from the defence procurements before and after the Kargil war, a larger question ? of submitting defence procurement accounts in Parliament so that it comes under public scrutiny ? has been sidelined for some time now because of the sensation created by the alleged involvement of Fernandes in the purchase of defence equipment amounting to over Rs 2,000 crore.

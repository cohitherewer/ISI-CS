 Sarabjit confession

 New Delhi, Sept. 11 (PTI): A day after Pakistans state-owned TV broadcast a purported statement of Sarabjit Singh confessing that he had carried out bomb blasts in 1990, his lawyer today said he did not know of such a recording and it was not part of the court records.

 Raha Abdul Hamid said there was nothing new in the PTV broadcast and it would have no effect on the case. Sarabjit, who Pakistan claims is Manjeet Singh, has been sentenced to death for alleged involvement in bomb blasts in Lahore and Multan.

 Referring to the tape, Abdul Hamid said: I dont know where it has come from or how it has come.

 This confession on video or audio, to my knowledge has not been produced before court at any time of trial nor is it part of record, nor it can be presumed that it is a statement, the lawyer said. Legally the statement is not on record nor is it on file of the case.

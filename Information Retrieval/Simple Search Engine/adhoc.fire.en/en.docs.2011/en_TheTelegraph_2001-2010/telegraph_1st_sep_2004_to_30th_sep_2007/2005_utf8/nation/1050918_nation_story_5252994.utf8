 Chief sings Atal paeans 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Sept. 17: His body language exuding reverence, L.K. Advani today showered praises on Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the one man who can be a most valuable ally in the BJP presidents battle of attrition with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

 Advani shared the dais with the former Prime Minister at a rally here this evening, on the second day of the BJP national executive, and used the occasion to highlight Vajpayees achievements as head of the NDA government.

 After people gave the BJP-led alliance a mandate in 1998 that enabled it to rule for six years, see all that the Vajpayee government did in the spheres of the economy, polity and international relations, Advani said.

 Successive Congress regimes that had ruled the country for a combined term of 45 years had failed to convert swaraj (self-governance) into suraj (good governance), Advani said. But six years had been enough for the Vajpayee government to distinguish itself by taking new initiatives in every field.

 The BJP chief cited how the NDA government had breathed fresh life into the river-linking project and fought terrorism with determination. It was Vajpayee, he said, who got President Pervez Musharaff to agree that Pakistan will not let its soil to be used as a base for cross-border terrorism.

 On the economic front, the Vajpayee government took huge initiatives in building highways and other infrastructure, he said. And all this was possible because of the way Vajpayee had managed the coalition of more than 20 parties in the NDA and kept it cohesive and disciplined.

 Other speakers, such as BJP vice-president Venkaiah Naidu and party national secretary, Ela Ganesan, too described how the Vajpayee regime provided good governance.

 Even the Tamil Nadu BJP unit, which organised the rally, took care to ensure that Vajpayee and Advani were honoured simultaneously with a shawl, a crown of flowers and a silver sword each.

 Advani later trained his guns on the UPA government and likened it to a car driven by two drivers. While one driver (the Congress) presses the accelerator, the other driver (the Left) presses the brakes, Advani said to laughter from the modest crowd.

 All the while, there is a third person trying to puncture the cars rear wheels, whom Advani associated with the bunch of tainted ministers in the ruling coalition.

 Vajpayee chose to use the occasion to play on the crowds sentiments by praising the late Dravidian leader, C.N. Annadurai, who was both a staunch nationalist and a champion of the Tamil language.

 Vajpayee said that Annadurais birth centenary, three years from now, should be celebrated not only in Tamil Nadu but throughout India.

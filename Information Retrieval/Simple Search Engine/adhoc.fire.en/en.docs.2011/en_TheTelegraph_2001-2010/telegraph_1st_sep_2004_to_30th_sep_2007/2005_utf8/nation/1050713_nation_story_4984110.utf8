 SC acid on migrants act burns defender Cong

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Guwahati, July 12: Striking down the Assam migrants act, the Supreme Court said the 22-year-old decree had not only been ineffective but also contradictory to the stated objective of checking unlawful influx.

 The verdict turned the ruling Congress, which had fought hard to retain the act, into a party of red faces and sent its opponents like the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the BJP into raptures.

 Illegal migration was the main factor that ignited what came to be known as the Assam Agitation in the eighties, which was eventually resolved by an accord spearheaded by Rajiv Gandhi.

 However, a clause in the law that made it difficult to pin down illegal migrants spread disquiet in Assam and kept the state on boil. (See chart)

 The Supreme Court today delivered a scathing indictment while scrapping the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act.

 If an act has the disaster effect of giving shelter and protection to foreign nationals who have illegally transgressed the international border and resided in India, the act is unconstitutional, a bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti, Justice G.P. Mathur and Justice P.K. Balasubramanyan said.

 The ruling included a set of directives, including transfer of all cases pending with the tribunals established under the IM(DT) Act to those under the Foreigners Act, which is applicable elsewhere in the country. Around 2.5 lakh such cases are pending now.

 The court asked the state and Union governments to constitute sufficient number of tribunals under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order to deal with cases of foreigners who have illegally come from Bangladesh or are illegally residing in Assam.

 In its 114-page verdict, the court also recommended fresh proceedings under the Foreigners Act against all such suspected illegal migrants whose cases had not been referred to the IMDT tribunals because of various reasons.

 While reactions to the verdict within the Congress ranged from astonishment to despair, the All Assam Students Union (AASU), the AGP and the BJP hailed the end of an act they held responsible for the influx of Bangladeshi migrants into Assam. 

 The AASU hoped the Foreigners Act would help the state surmount the obstacles in deporting illegal migrants. 

 In a cautious response to the unexpected setback to its strong defence of the IM(DT) Act, the Congress said a considered view on the apex courts order would be taken after a detailed examination of the basis of the judgment. 

 The Supreme Court has given its order. We have to study it. We have to find out the grounds on which the order was passed. Only after studying these aspects can we react, party spokesperson Anand Sharma said. 

 The Congress had tried hard while in the Opposition to force the erstwhile NDA government to drop its legislative proposal to repeal the IM(DT) Act two years ago. 

 Sharma said the Union home and law ministries would examine the courts verdict on the act before deciding whether to seek a review. It is for the Union cabinet to decide on this issue. 

 The BJP claimed a hand in the success of the anti-IMDT campaign, reminding everybody that it had tried to build a political consensus on the issue during its stint at the Centre. The NDA government had introduced a bill in Parliament to repeal the act but it did not make any headway after the Congress-led coalition came to power at the Centre.

 Ruined nets fuel canal protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Aug. 28: Fisherfolk in coastal villages near Nagapattinam are angry that their nets have been damaged by the dredging going on in the Palk Straits for the Sethusamudram ship canal project.

 Those living in the villages of Seruthur and Arkattuthruai Panchayat have borne the brunt of the damage. They have also complained of harassment by the local navy unit that is providing security to dredging vessels.

 Over 1,000 fisherfolk sat on dharna in front of the Nagapattinam district collectors office on Friday to protest the huge damage to their fishing nets and hampering of their fishing activity, Jesu Rathinam, convener of the Movement Against Sethusamudram (MAS), said.

 The Dredging Corporation of India began work last month in the sea off Point Calimere, south of Nagapattinam. The length of the canal will be 167 km, of which 89 km requires dredging.

 Union shipping minister T.R. Baalu had recently said experts from Alagappa University in Karaikudi were continuously on the lookout for environmental or any other damage because of the dredging and had not reported anything so far. 

 Global tenders for a major part of the dredging in the Adams Bridge area near Rameswaram will be finalised by November first week, Baalu said. Five international companies have shown interest.

 The MAS yesterday disputed Baalus claim and condemned the unruly behaviour of the local naval attachment.

 Over 100 nets of fishermen belonging to Seruthur, Arkattuthruai panchayat, Kameswaram and other villages have been torn so far because of dredging, Rathinam said. 

 Though the issue has been taken up by the district collector and the fisheries department, no steps have been taken to assess the damage to the nets and offer damages, he added.

 Fisherfolk from Seruthur had twice been stopped in the sea by the navy and attacked, he said. Four fishermen were hospitalised. The damaged nets are evidence of the destruction the Sethusamudram project can do to the fishing community, he said.

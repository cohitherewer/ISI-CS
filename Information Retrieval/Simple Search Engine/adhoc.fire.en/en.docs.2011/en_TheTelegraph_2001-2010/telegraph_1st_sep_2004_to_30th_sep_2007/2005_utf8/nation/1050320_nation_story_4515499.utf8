 Bihar sparks in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 19: The Lok Sabha today formally endorsed President?s rule in Bihar even as the Rashtriya Janata Dal, a key constituent in the UPA government, walked out of the House at the end of the debate.

 The Centre brought Bihar under President?s rule on March 7 after the Assembly polls threw up a fractured mandate and none of the political parties could notch up the required numbers to form a government. 

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil, in his response to the debate, said he hoped the elected representatives would be able to put together a government in the next six months. ?The earlier it is done, the better it will be,? Patil told the Lok Sabha. 

 RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, though bitter at the turn of events, has assured Congress president Sonia Gandhi that his party will not destabilise the government at the Centre. The party, with 25 MPs, is an indispensable ally. 

 The RJD, during the course of discussions, put the NDA and the Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan in the line of fire. 

 ?Those who are unable to form a government themselves are not allowing others to do so,? said party MP Devendra Prasad Yadav.

 A verbal clash between former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and Patil was the high point of the debate in the House. 

 Advani alleged that there was a failure of collective responsibility at the Centre. The BJP chief was referring to the absence of Laloo Prasad and his MPs from the House during the government?s reply to the debate. 

 Patil responded to the attack, saying that the RJD members were ?understandably? unhappy over the way the situation has turned out in Bihar. They have every right to express that view, he said. ?That is the beauty of democracy.?

 Nitish and Sharad gun for Paswan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 8: The Janata Dal (United) has rejected the suggestion repeatedly put forth by the Lok Janshakti Party to come out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance and form a ?secular? government in Bihar. 

 ?First let him (Ram Vilas Paswan) come out of the UPA,? Janata Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav said at a news conference here. Party chief Nitish Kumar was also present and blasted the LJP chief and rival Laloo Prasad Yadav in equal measure.

 They asked Paswan to ?respect the anti-RJD mandate? and help instal an alternative government and warned that ?whenever the people?s verdict was betrayed by a party, people have not forgiven the betrayal?.

 ?We have four Muslim MLAs. But will he (Paswan) decide on our behalf as to what we should do and who will be our CM?? the two asked. Paswan had earlier said he would prefer a chief minister from the minority community.

 The duo also accused the United Progressive Alliance ? the RJD, LJP, Congress and Left are its constituents ? of colluding to evolve a ?special mechanism? that would allow RJD chief Laloo Prasad, Paswan and the Congress to rule Patna from Delhi by ?proxy?. 

 ?The LJP is power-hungry so it has become part of this mechanism. Paswan is making it look as though President?s rule will deliver heaven on earth and democracy is rotten. His propaganda amounts to a rejection of democracy. It is pointless holding an election if the idea is to instal central rule after people have delivered an anti-RJD mandate,? the duo said.

 They claimed that throughout the elections they had voiced a suspicion that the Laloo Prasad-Paswan war of words was a mere ?put on?.

 If Paswan was sincere in his intent to oust Laloo Prasad he would have ensured a coalition of the anti-RJD forces, they said. ?He wants to remain in the government in Delhi and share power with Laloo.? 

 The ?suspicion? was that the RJD and LJP chiefs were part of the ?larger conspiracy? to ?inflict? President?s rule on Bihar. The anti-Laloo votes got divided and threw up a fractured mandate. ?This has confirmed our suspicion,? the Dal (U) leaders said. 

 The two even produced the seat-wise election results to establish that of the 29 seats the LJP won, in as many as 23 the RJD was number two. They said this showed that the people had voted for a possible RJD alternative.

 Piling more heat on Paswan and Laloo Prasad, Kumar said they were only ?fighting? for the loaves and crumbs of central rule. ?Yesterday, the RJD chief met the Prime Minister, home minister, Sonia Gandhi and Left leaders. Today, the LJP leader did the rounds. The idea is the same ? how to extract the best deal for themselves from this arrangement.?

 The Dal (U) has more reason to be annoyed with Paswan, especially after he put the blame of non-formation of a government in Bihar on them.

 Patna, April 9: Shivanand Tiwari, the RJD leader who had vowed to flout the ban on his entry into Siwan, did travel to the district today, but in a police vehicle.

 Tiwari was arrested by Patna police as he was leaving for Siwan and was taken to be produced before the district magistrate?s court there.

 District magistrate C.K. Anil had barred Tiwari from entering Siwan for two months after the RJD leader made derogatory remarks against him at a function attended by party chief and railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav. When Tiwari threatened to flout the ban, Anil issued an arrest warrant against him under Section 113 of the CrPC, which deals with ?wilful breach of public peace and tranquillity?.

 Last night, chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyan and police chief Narayan Mishra rushed to Tiwari?s house to persuade him to put off his trip. But he refused.

 ?The ban order on my entry is illegal, unconstitutional and injudicious, which I will oppose tooth and nail. I am prepared to face any consequence for it, even go to jail, but will not seek any bail,? Tiwari said this morning, as he was getting ready to leave.

 Hours later, however, he was granted bail by the district magistrate who held a makeshift court in a school on the outskirts of Siwan.

 Anil was sent to Siwan just before the polls this year on the Election Commission?s orders. He had barred controversial RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin from the district for six months, a move that invited criticism from Tiwari who threatened to ?teach him a lesson?.

 Officials in the state were unhappy about the visit of their seniors to Tiwari?s house. ?Why should the top bureaucrats bow down before an ordinary party leader when President?s rule is in effect?? one asked. 

 Subramanyan also made a written request to Tiwari to postpone his trip.

 ?I appreciate the good intentions of the chief secretary and police chief, who visited me last night in a bid to defuse the tension. But it is too late. I want the DM to revoke the ban and make a public apology. Or I will go ahead with my plan,? Tiwari said, as he sat in the portico surrounded by a few supporters. No senior party leader, barring Iliyas Hussain, was present.

 ?It is a personal fight against the violation of my personal rights. I don?t need the go-ahead from anyone, even Lalooji,? he added.

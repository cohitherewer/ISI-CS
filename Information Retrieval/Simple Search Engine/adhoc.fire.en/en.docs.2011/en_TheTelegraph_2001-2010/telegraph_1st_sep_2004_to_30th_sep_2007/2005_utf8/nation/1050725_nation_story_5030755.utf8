 Television cure for two-faced MPs

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, July 24: MPs may no longer be able to say one thing before the TV cameras in the House and another at the closed-door standing committee meetings.

 The reason is, these meetings may not remain closed-door any more if the Lok Sabha Speaker has his way.

 Somnath Chatterjee ? who has already clamped curbs on junkets by members of the 24 department-related House standing committees ? now plans to throw the panel discussions open to the media, both print and electronic.

 Sources said most political parties have welcomed the suggestion, but some double-talking MPs are against it.

 These members talk about socialism and equality inside the House (whose proceedings are telecast live and reported in newspapers), but in the standing committees (whose reports influence government decisions) they lobby for certain business houses, a Lok Sabha secretariat source said. They are worried that the media scanner will expose them.

 If Chatterjees proposal gets the green light, it will bring transparency and accountability in the functioning of Parliament panels.

 But, sources said, there could be a genuine problem with the plan. When officials are asked to depose before the committees, they may try to duck the summons for fear of being identified, or be less than frank while speaking under the media glare.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad shares this fear. Asked whether House panel meetings should be telecast, he had said it wasnt possible because not all parties wanted it. If telecast is allowed, officials would not come forward with the truth. 

 Parliament sources said the problem can be tackled by barring the media from that part of a panels proceedings where a witness appears before the committee.

 The move will solve another problem, too. Currently, Doordarshans DD LS and DD RS channels ? which beam Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha proceedings respectively ? remain idle when Parliament is not in session. The telecast of panel meetings will allow Doordarshan to utilise the software.

 Chatterjee is also taking steps to force cable operators to beam live telecast of Parliaments proceedings as they are required to do by the law.

 Dias for Rome after mass

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 5: Archbishop of Mumbai Cardinal Ivan Dias will leave for Vatican City tomorrow night to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II scheduled on Friday, his office said.

 Cardinal Dias will preside over a specially convened Solemn Requiem Mass in memory of the Pope at 6.30 pm at the Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba tomorrow before flying off to Rome. 

 He will be among the three Indian cardinals who will participate in the secret ballot that will elect the successor to the Pope.

 The Mumbai-based Catholic Secular Forum has called upon Catholics in India to pray for the election of Cardinal Dias as the next Pope.

 Cardinal Dias will be joined by Kerala-based Cardinal Varkey Vithayathil, the head of the Syro Malabar Church, and Cardinal Telesophore Toppo, the Archbishop of Ranchi, during the Pope?s funeral at the Vatican. 

 Born in 1936, the 68-year-old Cardinal Dias was ordained as a priest on December 8, 1958. He spent his first three years in Mumbai doing pastoral work before travelling to Rome for further studies.

 In 1964, he joined the church?s diplomatic service and spent the next 30 years working in nunciatures or papal embassies around the world, and as a desk officer in the Vatican?s Secretariat of State.

 He was the secretary of nunciatures in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Indonesia and Mauritius until 1973. He returned to his native Mumbai in 1997 as the archbishop.

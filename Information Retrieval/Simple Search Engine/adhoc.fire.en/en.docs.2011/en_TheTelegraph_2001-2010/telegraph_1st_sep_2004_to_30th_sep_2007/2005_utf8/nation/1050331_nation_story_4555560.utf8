 Modi foes at Advani door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 30: BJP rebel leaders from Gujarat arrived here for talks with L.K. Advani even as the party brass tried to broker a deal between Narendra Modi and his detractors.

 The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, after which Modi is likely to call on the BJP president to give his side of the story. 

 The Gujarat chief minister had called on former Prime Minister on Atal Bihari Vajpayee last night for a 45-minute talk.

 The dissident leaders are demanding Modi?s ouster but Advani is known to be on the chief minister?s side. 

 To buy peace, the party leadership is likely to force Modi to go in for a cabinet expansion ? which he has been delaying ? to accommodate some of the dissidents. Some may also be made corporation chairpersons, sources said.

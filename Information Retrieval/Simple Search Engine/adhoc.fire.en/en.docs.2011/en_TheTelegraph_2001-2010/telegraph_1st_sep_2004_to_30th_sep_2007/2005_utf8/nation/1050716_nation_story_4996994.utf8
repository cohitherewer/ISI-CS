 Experts shed a tear for Taj

 Taj Mahal: In safe hands?

 New Delhi, July 15: Historians have warned that future generations may see monuments like Taj Mahal only in history books if the Archaeological Survey of India hands over their care to private trusts.

 The caution comes in the backdrop of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Wakf Board declaring itself the owner of the Taj and the tussle between the Wakf board and the Shahi Imam over Delhis Jama Masjid.

 The historians feel the ASI is the only body in India capable of maintaining monuments like the Taj, Jama Masjid and several temples in south India. 

 No one other than the ASI is competent enough to look after these monuments, many of which are 350 years old or even older, said Mridula Mukherjee, a professor of history at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

 Ownership by private trusts or boards of monuments like the Taj, the historians feel, will remove any accountability for their maintenance.

 Ownership of monuments in the West varies from case to case but the standards of maintenance are very high, unlike in India, they said.

 The Popes residence, which dates back to the 15th century at least, is owned by the Vatican. Similarly, several monuments of historical importance in the West are owned by museums. However, in India, even the ASI cannot match those standards. Private caretakers would be a recipe for disaster, said author Arjun Dev.

 Historians sought to distinguish between monuments like Jama Masjid, where prayers are held regularly, and the Taj, where no daily ceremony is held. However, they believe that the ASI can look after both kinds of monuments.

 There are monuments like the temple at Tanjore, the Venkateshwara temples in Andhra Pradesh or even Jama Masjid in Delhi, where people come to worship. The Tanjore temple is opened on some days of the week for worshippers by the ASI, said Dev.

 These are not monuments that are only representative of any community. Otherwise, tomorrow, people might demand that one half of Ajanta-Ellora goes to Buddhists and the other to Hindus, and so on, said historian Dilip Simeon.

 Historian Irfan Habib feels the ownership claims by private groups are ahistorical. 

 The Wakf had the duty to look after the Taj during Shah Jahans period; that is recorded in the historical documents from the period. But the documents mention the Taj being the property of the sovereign. So the Taj was the property of the government through the Mughal period, Habib said.

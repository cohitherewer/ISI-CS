 Seer case shifts to Pondicherry

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has transferred the trial in the Shankar Raman murder case, involving the Kanchi Mutt acharyas, to Pondicherry, reports our special correspondent.

 In a balancing act, the court conceded Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswatis plea for transfer of the case outside Tamil Nadu, but also yielded to the states request that if it should be shifted, the trial should be held in Pondicherry. 

 The seer had sought transfer of the case to Chitoor or nearby areas in Andhra Pradesh. 

 The pontiff, the main accused in the case, had said the state machinery had created enough apprehension and was interfering in the case and its free and fair trial. 

 Aid row in Sarabjit family

 Bhikiwind (PTI): The financial aid that 

 has poured in for Sarabjit Singh has apparently split his 

 family, with his wife Sukhpreet Kaur alleging that her sister-in-law 

 Dalbir Kaur has pocketed all the money, a charge denied 

 by the latter.

 My sister-in-law has collected a lot of money from different avenues under the Save Sarabjit campaign and to help his family. But things have gone in a different direction as Dalbir has started living a luxurious life and is not sharing a single paisa with us, Sukhpreet told reporters. Sarabjit is on death row in Pakistan for his alleged involvement in blasts there.

 Dalbir has received aid more than Rs 20 lakh but she has not given any money to me and my daughter, Sukhpreet said, adding that Sarabjits sister had physically harmed her and warned that she should not speak of this to the media. 

 Dalbir said there was no truth in the allegations.

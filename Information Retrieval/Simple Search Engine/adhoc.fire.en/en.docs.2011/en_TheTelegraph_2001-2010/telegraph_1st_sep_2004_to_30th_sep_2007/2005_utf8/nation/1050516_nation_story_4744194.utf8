 Sad bow-out for EC boss

 New Delhi, May 15: On his last day in office, chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy said he was saddened by the allegations levelled against the poll panel regarding the Chhapra Lok Sabha election. 

 L.V. Saptharishi, special election observer in Chhapra, has accused election commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswamy of making casteist remarks and also alleged that the poll panel had countermanded the Chhapra election at the BJPs dictates. 

 Krishnamurthys last days in office had been mired in allegations against the poll panel, but the outgoing commission chief said ? in his last news conference before retirement ? that the body had come out with flying colours.

 I felt it was sad. It was very unfortunate such things should have happened. My own inference is it is an attempt to denigrate the Election Commission so that its authority gets weakened. 

 The outgoing poll panel chief said he is upset as he feels the credibility of a decision by the three-member poll panel is being questioned and politicised. Krishnamurthy, Tandon and Gopalaswamy, had met the President.

 Krishnamurthy said he was, however, glad that the reaction from every responsible quarter to the controversy was in favour of the commission. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had also come out strongly in defence of the Election Commission, saying such institutions must be respected and strengthened.

 The poll panel chief said he had been able to steer the commission through this difficult period and claimed he had successfully upheld the neutrality of the commission. 

 Krishnamurthy said he was leaving with the belief that he had upheld the best traditions of the institution he headed and said the credibility of the commission is at its peak.

 He said the poll panel should be strengthened and given penal powers and felt that the model code of conduct should become a law. This would enable the commission to take quicker action against those who break the code during polls. Normally a court drags on with the case for several months with the election long over and sometimes the issue forgotten.

 The outgoing chief said the panel was not popular with politicians. Unfortunately, no political party likes to be disciplined. Whenever rules are required to be enforced, the political party concerned does not like if it is enforced strictly.

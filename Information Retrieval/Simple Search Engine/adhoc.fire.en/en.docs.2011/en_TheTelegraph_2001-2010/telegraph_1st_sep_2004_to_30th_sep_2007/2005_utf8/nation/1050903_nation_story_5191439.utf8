 Patents library for Indian herbs

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Sept. 2: A Rs 120-crore knowledge protection project is under way to stop foreign countries from awarding patents on traditional Indian medicinal herbs.

 All the known Ayurvedic, Unani and Siddha formulations, with their chemical and curative properties, are being compiled in a digital library, Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said today.

 The information ? in English, Spanish, French, Japanese and German ? will be made available to patents offices abroad by the end of the year, after cabinet approval.

 Its their ignorance of Indian systems of medicine that led foreign countries to award patents on turmeric and neem, the minister said.

 The digital library will contain details of about 75,000 Ayurvedic medicines, 50,000 Unani formulations and 15,000 of the Siddha system, which originated in Tamil Nadu. India has the largest number of Unani practitioners though the system was born in Iran.

 The project, called the Golden Triangle Programme, is a joint effort by the Council For Scientific and Industrial Research, Indian Council of Medical Research and the department of Indian systems of medicine.

 Ramadoss was speaking to reporters on the eve of the inauguration of the first National Institute of Siddha at suburban Tambaram by the Prime Minister. The Rs 47-crore teaching and research institute near Chennai has a 120-bed Siddha hospital. The institute will provide scientific backing to the Siddha system, the minister said.

 The Centre is also considering amending the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act to ban advertisement of miracle cures by quacks.

 Ramadoss arrived here from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, where seven districts are in the grip of a Japanese encephalitis epidemic that has killed more than 350 patients. The minister said 2 lakh synthetic mosquito nets are being sent to the affected districts along with over 100 fogging machines, which kill mosquitoes. The infection spreads through mosquito bites.

 He admitted there is a shortage of vaccines ? which are made from mouse brains -- but added that the Indian Council of Medical Research has been asked to speed up the development of a tissue culture-based vaccine as a long-term solution.

 All children in the 60 encephalitis-prone districts in the country will be vaccinated, Ramadoss said.

 He confirmed that the ban on smoking in films and television serials will come into effect on October 2.

 Ramadoss said he would personally be happy to ban all tobacco products. When 40 per cent of health problems are due to tobacco products, we cannot keep quiet.

 The Centre will soon make it mandatory for tobacco companies to carry pictorial warnings ? such as how a cancer patient looks ? on packs and advertisements, covering a minimum of 50 per cent of the space.

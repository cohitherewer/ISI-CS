 CPM rejects divestment compromise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 31: There seems to be no way out of the impasse hanging over the Centres decision to sell 10 per cent of the shares in Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel).

 The CPM, the biggest hurdle, has reiterated its opposition, ruling out a compromise on its principled stand against disinvestment in navratna public sector companies.

 Addressing a news conference after a politburo meeting, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said Left parties would continue to stay away from the coordination committee meetings with the United Progressive Alliance to protest against the governments betrayal of the National Common Minimum Programme by deciding to divest Bhel shares.

 He also rejected the so-called compromise formula, which entails reducing the divestment from 10 to five per cent. It is not a question of percentage but opposition to disinvestment in the navratna companies as a matter of principle, Karat said.

 On the impending Bihar elections, he said the CPM would endeavour to bring the UPA constituents together to take on the BJP-Janata Dal (United). We hope to see wider understanding among the UPA constituents, including the Lok Janshakti Party.

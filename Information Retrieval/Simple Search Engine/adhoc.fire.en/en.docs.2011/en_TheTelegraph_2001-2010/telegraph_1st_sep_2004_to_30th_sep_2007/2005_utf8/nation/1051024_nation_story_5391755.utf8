 Airline in court to check pilot flight

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has issued a notice to a pilot on an Indian Airlines petition seeking to restrain him from joining any rival airline without serving the mandatory six-month notice period.

 Justice R.C. Jain, who asked pilot Tarun Bahri to respond by November 11, however, did not pass any interim order in favour of the airline. Employed with the airline since 1988, Bahri resigned on April 5 with immediate effect. Indian Airlines counsel pointed out that despite the company having rejected his resignation, Bahri did not report for duty. Shortage of pilots had prompted the public sector airline to make it mandatory for them to give the six-month notice, instead of one month, the counsel said. 

 The airline pointed out that it took four months and cost about Rs 25 lakh to train a pilot to operate an aircraft.

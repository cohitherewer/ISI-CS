 Rajnath rolls up 

his sleeves

 - Heartland priority for 

 BJP president-elect

 Rajnath: Guarded

 New Delhi, Dec. 24: Within hours of being told he would succeed L.K. Advani as BJP chief, Rajnath Singh provided a glimpse of his agenda and style.

 Rather than receive jubilant supporters at home, he dashed off to a rally in western Uttar Pradesh, providing a sure sign that his immediate priority is reviving the party in the heartland.

 Though the BJP isnt ready to make an official announcement, senior leader Jaswant Singh had called Rajnath last night to tell him he was the president-elect.

 The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister was characteristically guarded about betraying any sign of excitement or joy today. He wouldnt make speeches before the TV cameras, nor would he allow supporters to create a spectacle at his home.

 He told Khurja MP Ashok Pradhan to pipe down and stop distributing sweets, and barely smiled at Ravi Shankar Prasad as the former Union minister congratulated him.

 His visit to Advanis house early in the morning, however, indicated that he knew about the partys decision. Even then, he was cautious before the waiting journalists.

 Asked if he was the next president, he said Advaniji is our president before adding: I have always been a loyal party worker. I have discharged every responsibility that the party chose to give me.

 Soon, Rajnath headed for Hasanpur in JP Nagar, western Uttar Pradesh, to protest against the murder of a district panchayat member. This visit was part of the nyay yatra, which the BJP had launched in the state after party MP Nityanand Rais murder in November.

 The yatra will be a test of Rajnaths acumen since it has been conceived and led solely by him. Already, other senior state BJP leaders ? such as Lalji Tandon, Kalraj Mishra and Kalyan Singh ? have more or less distanced themselves from the campaign.

 Well see what he can do here. He claims to represent the Thakurs, who are only about eight per cent of the electorate. Most have aligned with the Samajwadi Party anyway. The Brahmins have gone with the Bahujan Samaj Party. Its not a cakewalk in UP, a state BJP leader warned.

 In Delhi, the party denied it had picked a new chief. No decision has been taken, Advani said. M. Venkaiah Naidu echoed him.

 The only senior leader to openly congratulate Rajnath was the man he had beaten to the post. Murli Manohar Joshi said: I wish him well. The party has made a good choice.

 Late in the evening, Rajnath returned to Delhi and met Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose support had got him the top job.

 The new, mid-term president has to quit after a year when this councils tenure ends, and the buzz had been that a new chief would then be elected.

 But one leader said: Now that Rajnath has come with the Sanghs approval, it looks like he will continue for three more years after his interim tenure ends.

 A former BJP president, however, said the term of one-plus-three years may still not happen. Assembly polls are scheduled in states where the BJP is not expected to do too well. A lot can change in one year, he said.

 HC arrest rap on police

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 15: The high court today reiterated its order and directed the state police to immediately arrest all absconders with pending non-bailable arrest warrants in the state.

 The court was hearing a PIL filed by the Indian Medical Association (IMA).

 The division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S.N. Hussain ordered director-general of police Narayan Mishra, range inspectors-general and superintendents of police to complete the process and report to the court by March 31.

 On January 5, the court had directed the police to arrest the absconding criminals ? who faced non-bailable charges ? when they appeared to file their nomination papers for the Assembly polls. The court was responding to an observation by the police that there were more than 15,000 absconders in Bihar.

 Taking serious exception to the inability of the police to implement the order, the bench today asked, ?How come so many of the so-called absconders end up giving interviews to the media and addressing public meetings and you say they are out of reach??

 The state counsel, S.D. Yadav, argued that the government and the police were carrying out the arrests in the right earnest and pleaded for more time. 

 Advocate M.P. Gupta intervened for the IMA and said the state has miserably failed to implement the order. ?Hardly a thousand absconders have been arrested in more than two months. The rest are roaming freely all over the state but the police feign ignorance,? he said.

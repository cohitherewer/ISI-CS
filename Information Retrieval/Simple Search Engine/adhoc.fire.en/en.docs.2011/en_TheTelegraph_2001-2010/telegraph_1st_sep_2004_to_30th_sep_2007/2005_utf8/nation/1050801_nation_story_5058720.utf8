 Kannadigas add to bar row

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, July 31: Maharashtra governor S.M. Krishnas decision last month to refer the draft ordinance banning dance bars back to the government has set off a murmur campaign about alleged Kannadiga dominance in the state Congress.

 The whispers have reached the Congresss 24, Akbar Road headquarters in Delhi and 10 Janpath, the residence of party chief Sonia Gandhi.

 Prominent state leaders, including chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and former minister Krupashankar Singh, are subtly campaigning with the central leadership to remove the imbalance created by Kannadiga domination in the Maharashtra unit.

 Motives were attributed when Krishna, a former Karnataka chief minister, returned the draft with an advice that a bill on the issue be introduced in the monsoon session of the Assembly because there was no urgency about the ban. 

 His critics in the Congress saw in the move an attempt to protect the interests of dance bar owners, a majority of whom are apparently from Karnataka.

 But the real target is other prominent Kannadigas. On top of the list is Margaret Alva, the AICC general secretary in charge of Maharashtra affairs, followed by others like Mumbai regional Congress committee chief Gurudas Kamat; Suresh Shetty, a junior minister in the Deshmukh ministry, and Pune party boss Suresh Kalmadi.

 Alva has come under attack as Deshmukh is not comfortable with her handling of state Congress affairs. The distance widened after Krishnas arrival in Mumbai as governor last November. Krishna and Alva were rivals in the Karnataka Congress.

 Alva, who eyed the Mumbai Raj Bhavan chair, apparently believes she lost it to Krishna because of Deshmukhs friendly equation with the former Karnataka chief minister. 

 Deshmukh was the partys central leader in charge of Karnataka affairs during the last year of Krishnas chief ministership.

 Sources say Deshmukh suspects that Alva is backing his rivals in the state Congress. He and some Mumbai Congress leaders are understood to be keen on having someone else in Alvas place. 

 But they would have to wait to see if they are successful in their lobbying as Sonia has delayed the proposed revamp of her team of AICC office-bearers.

 The anti-Kannadiga leaders hope that Narayan Ranes entry into the Congress would help them in their campaign. The Shiv Sena, which recently expelled him, had campaigned against non-Maharashtrian domination in Mumbai.

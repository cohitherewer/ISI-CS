 No monitor for Indus 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, June 27: The water levels in the Sutlej and its tributary, the Pare Chu, may have dropped, but officials admit that the lack of a mechanism to forecast floods caused by a swelling Indus is a matter of concern.

 Government sources say that while the ministry of water resources keeps a regular check on all Indian rivers, when it comes to the Indus, which India shares with Pakistan, no monitoring of the water level is carried out. 

 Sources in the ministry refused to say why.

 Officials cited an example to underline the importance of a flood forecast mechanism. They say todays warning by the Central Water Commission about possible floods in Dibrugarh and Nimajighat, both on the banks of the overflowing Brahmaputra, would give the national disaster management cell of the home ministry enough time to plan a strategy.

 The lack of a similar mechanism for the Indus means that disaster management, in the event of a situation like the one in Himachal Pradesh now, can start only after reports of the flooding start coming in. But by then, the damage would be done.

 Over 5,000 people were yesterday evacuated from their villages in Himachal Pradesh, mainly due to the prompt action taken by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. Government sources, however, concede that the situation could have been worse.

 Several hundred tourists were left stranded because of the lack of any warning. It brings back memories of the lack of an effective warning system that resulted in the death of thousands of people when the tsunami struck the Indian Ocean coastline on December 26 last year.

 Officials in the water resources ministry say there are 550 observation sites throughout the country on all rivers except the Indus.

 In addition, there are 173 forecast centres. Of these, 145 centres forecast water levels in rivers that fall in their region. The remaining 28 centres forecast the inflow volume into the rivers.

 All these centres and observation sites send the data collected to 21 cells, with New Delhi being the central headquarters. Here, experts in the water resources ministry analyse the data and by noon each day warn the disaster management cell about possible floods.

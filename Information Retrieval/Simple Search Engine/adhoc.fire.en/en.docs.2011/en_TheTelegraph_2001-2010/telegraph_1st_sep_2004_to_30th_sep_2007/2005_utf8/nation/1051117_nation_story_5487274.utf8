The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 In the flicker of lantern, shadow of tie

 UTTAM SENGUPTA

 Laloo Prasad: Brave face

 Patna/Nalanda, Nov. 16: Campaigning comes to an end tomorrow for the longest election held in the country.

 While the first phase of polling had taken place to elect the next Bihar Assembly on October 18, the last phase of polling will be held exactly a month later on November 19.

 Voters, meanwhile, have begun speaking in riddles. Gone is the tension of past elections when scores of people would get killed in poll-related violence. With just one accidental killing reported so far, when a mentally challenged person approached a BSF contingent with a toy pistol and was shot dead, the mood in the Bihar countryside is deceptively relaxed.

 Indeed, voters appear to be enjoying themselves hugely as would be evident in the following conversation overheard this afternoon at a roadside eatery at Harnaut, the home turf of Janata Dal (United) leader and chief ministerial hopeful Nitish Kumar.

 A middle-aged man, while discussing electoral prospects, light-heartedly declared: The lantern age is over. The lantern is, of course, the symbol of Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). 

 Not in Bihar, interrupted an acquaintance of his, there is no electricity in the state and it is the lantern we must turn to. 

 This prompted a caustic comment from someone. Where is the kerosene to light the lantern? Even when it is available, how many of us can afford it? This provoked the second man to quip: The companies are different brother, why blame the lantern for kerosene oil?

 Notwithstanding the banter, people in Bihar are finally betraying some signs of tension as they argue over the prospects.

 On the surface, it is a battle between a rather cocky and hopeful National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and a defiant, even a little desperate RJD.

 Laloo Prasad maintains a brave face and claims, without much conviction, that not just a wind, but a storm is blowing in favour of the UPA.

 He has reasons to be optimistic. Drawing lessons from the February debacle, the RJD has put up a far more credible and concerted campaign this time. The Muslim minority in the state appears to have come out of the trauma of the 1989 communal riot at Bhagalpur and rallied round the Congress and RJD combine.

 The bickering among a multiplicity of Yadav candidates is much less than in February and, for a change, Laloo Prasad has been more judicious in selecting his candidates, denying nomination to his extended family for the first time, for example. 

 This does not impress a relaxed Arun Jaitley in the BJP office. The Muslim-Yadav combination, he declares, is a force to reckon with when a multiplicity of parties are contesting the election. But in a bipolar set-up, the combination, even if it is intact, might not really matter.

 For chief minister-in-waiting Nitish Kumar, it is now or never. For the first time in his long political career, his acceptability cuts across the caste and geographical divides.

 He does appear to have struck a chord with his call for change. But he is hard put to explain the presence of a large number of former musclemen fielded by both his party and the BJP.

 Only a braveheart would hazard a guess about the outcome. But with barely a week to go before the curtain goes up on the Bihar polls, the tantalising possibility of a tie has begun to haunt the strategists in the state capital. If that happens, a lame-duck government is what the electorate will deliver.

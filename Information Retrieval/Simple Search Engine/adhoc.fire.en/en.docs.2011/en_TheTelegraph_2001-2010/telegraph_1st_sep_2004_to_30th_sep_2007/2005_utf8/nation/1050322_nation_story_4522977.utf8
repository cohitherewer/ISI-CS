 Roadshow after cop crackdown

 - Dadan celebrates end 

of RJD ?evil raj?

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, March 21: ?Colourful? celebrations of the festival of colour put Dadan Pehalwan in a spot of bother before he bounced back with an extravagant roadshow.

 Patna police swung into action late last night and seized a number of loudspeakers, which were blaring a variety of ?spicy? Holi songs, from the state Samajwadi Party chief?s house on Kautilya Road here.

 Nearly two-dozen nautch girls, roped in for the entertainment of Pehalwan and friends as part of the three-day Holi milan programme, ducked for cover when the police swooped down on the house.

 ?We had to step in and stop the programme as it violated the Bihar Use and Control of Loudspeaker Act and register a case against Pehalwan,? deputy superintendent of police (Sachivalaya) Arshad Jaman said.

 Reportedly, VIPs who resided in the vicinity of Pehalwan?s house ? including a few high court judges ? had objected to the ?noise pollution? caused by the Holi celebrations, which forced the police to rush to the spot and put an end to the show.

 Pehalwan held that he had taken ?due permission? from the authorities for the function. However, the police said he could not produce any proof of the ?permission?. 

 Hours after the night raid, Pehalwan was back in the limelight as he went ahead with his planned Holi procession in the heart of the capital today. 

 Pehalwan himself served rice and meat to over a thousand supporters and Holi revellers before flagging off the rath of the mythological deity, Lorik. Hundreds of people danced to the tunes of Holi numbers, matching steps with the nautch girls.

 ?The celebrations are in keeping with the culture of Bihar,? Pehalwan said.

 The day started with a meeting of party workers at the politician?s residence. ?Our Holi procession will celebrate the end of the 15 years of the ?evil raj? of Laloo-Rabri,? Pehalwan told his supporters. 

 ?Laloo Prasad Yadav fooled the people of the state for 15 years and (BJP leader) Sushil Kumar Modi works for him in secret. Let Nitish Kumar, my elder brother, detach himself from the NDA and help us form a third front and a new government in the state,? he said.

 ?Laloo wants me to join his forces by accepting the post of deputy chief minister. But let him first help my chief Mulayam Singh Yadav become Prime Minister and then I will consider making him the home minister,? Pehalwan thundered.

 Om Prakash Yadav, the party candidate who lost from Buxar in the Assembly polls, called Pehalwan the ?second Krishna? and ?future chief minister of Bihar?.

 There was a word of caution for Mohammad Shahabuddin too. ?Shahabuddin is a fool if he still entertains the idea that he can help Laloo Prasad form the next government with the power of his weapons and goondas. I know how to take him on,? Pehalwan warned.

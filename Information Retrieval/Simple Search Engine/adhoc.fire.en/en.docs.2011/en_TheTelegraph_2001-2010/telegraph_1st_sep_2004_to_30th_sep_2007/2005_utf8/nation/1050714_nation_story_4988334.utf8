The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 News amp; NGOs to stay out of FM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 13: The Centre today liberalised norms for investment by private FM radio that will now span the length and breadth of the country with an estimated 336 stations to begin in 90 cities and towns. 

 Foreign direct investment will be allowed up to 20 per cent but news and current affairs on FM radio will continue to be a no-no.

 The policy to liberalise investment in FM radio was cleared by the cabinet on June 30 but the rules were notified by the Union information and broadcasting ministry today.

 The 336 FM radio stations that are expected to start in the second phase of the FM radio expansion programme have been divided in four categories. 

 In the metros ? Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai ? a company bidding for an FM radio licence must have a minimum net worth of Rs 3 crore. A firm wanting to set up a chain of FM radio stations across the country would need to have a minimum net worth of Rs 10 crore. At the lowest end, in the D category, an FM licencee must have a net worth of Rs 50 lakh.

 Ministry sources said proposals had been received for news and current affairs programmes but the home ministry had advised against allowing such programming in the absence of a monitoring mechanism.

 The norms also forbid religious and political organisations, advertising agencies and non-government organisations from bidding for licences.

 The information and broadcasting ministry said the permission for FM radio stations will be granted on the basis of one-time entry fees quoted by bidders under a closed tender system. This is a departure from the policy for the first phase of FM radio programming where fees were quoted under an open bidding system.

 Bidding will be conducted in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai and the dates will be notified later. 

 The government will charge an annual fee at the rate of 4 per cent of gross revenue or 10 per cent of the reserve one-time entry fee, which ever is higher. An applicant will be allowed to run only one channel per city. 

 On foreign investment, the policy allows FIIs to pick up not more than a 20 per cent stake in Indian FM licence holding companies.

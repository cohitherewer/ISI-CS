 Mufti pledges security

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, April 1: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today assured foolproof security to the passengers of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service in the wake of the threat issued by four militant outfits to target the bus.

 Mufti announced in the Assembly that the passengers would be provided full security and ?there will be no laxity on this account?.

 ?The militants failed to deter us in the past and will not succeed now either,? Mufti said in response to a point raised by some Opposition members about the leaking of the first list of passengers.

 ?Our determination to bring down the walls of hatred is unshakeable.?

 The chief minister said ?only one person has received a threatening phone call made from England warning him against travelling by the Muzaffarabad-bound bus?.

 ?The intending passenger told the caller that he was not afraid and would go ahead with his travel plan,? Mufti added.

 The chief minister said since 1947, the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service has become a major issue with which the people of the state have a strong attachment.

 Mufti said a list of 40 intending passengers had been forwarded to Pakistan, which granted clearance to 29 people ? eight from Rajouri district, six each from Baramulla and Srinagar districts, four from Poonch district and two each from Kupwara and Jammu districts and one from Anantnag district.

 Border pact lines drawn

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, April 10: India and China today ironed out differences on the ?political parameters and guiding principles? to resolve the boundary issue.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao are expected to sign the agreement when they meet here tomorrow.

 ?Special representatives? Dai Bing Guo and M.K. Narayanan thrashed out the differences as Wen arrived in the capital from Bangalore.

 ?The special representatives met today and had fruitful talks with a view to finalising the Documents on Guiding Principles for signatures tomorrow,? foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said.

 In the evening, Wen arrived here with a large delegation, including representatives of key business enterprises of China.

 Apart from the boundary framework deal, the two sides are also likely to sign agreements on information technology, cross-border river management, cultural exchanges, civil aviation, science and technology, and trade and commerce.

 Also expected is a joint statement by the two leaders that will clearly indicate the new high in Sino-Indian relations and their desire to factor in both regional and global perspectives. The agreement on the boundary issue could be part of the joint statement.

 Over the next two days, Wen will hold intensive discussions with the Indian leadership, including President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Singh and foreign minister K. Natwar Singh.

 Apart from the entire gamut of the bilateral ties, the situation in Nepal, relations of the two countries with Pakistan, WTO, UN Security Council expansion, and environment are likely to figure in the discussions.

 Wen met UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi this evening and will meet the leader of the Opposition, L.K. Advani. 

 He is also scheduled to address the captains of Indian industry and deliver a lecture on bilateral relations at the Indian Institute of Technology here.

 Forming the archway to an amicable settlement of the boundary issue will be the ?political parameters and guiding principles?, which have elements like historical background, ground reality, and overall political relationship based on ?mutual accommodation?.

 There was, however, no clear signal on Sikkim and whether the issue would be reflected in the joint statement. Sources said even if it was not, Wen might find an opportunity while in Delhi to clarify his country?s position on the state.

 Delhi wants Beijing to categorically acknowledge that Sikkim is an integral part of India.

 Wen?s hosts in Bangalore could not avoid some embarrassing moments this afternoon when the Tibetan activist climbed atop a tower at the Indian Institute of Science premises where the leader was interacting with scientists.

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: A jawan shot dead his senior in the guard room of Union minister Dayanidhi Marans residence today. 

 Suresh Dogra, a head constable of the Central Reserve Police Force, died on the spot when constable Ganesh Suthar pumped five bullets from his SLR into his chest and abdomen this morning.

 Ganesh was caught soon after and handed over to Tughlaq Road police station, where he was booked for murder. He had been posted in the 73rd battalion of CRPF.

 The incident took place around 7.30 am following a quarrel between the constables. Ganesh fired at his senior in the guard room, paces away from the communications and IT ministers house on the high-security 6 Akbar Road.

 Additional deputy commissioner of police, Delhi, Manish Aggarwal said: Ganesh was facing a departmental inquiry regarding unauthorised absence from work for over three to four months. He had joined back and Suresh was to give his statement against him as a witness in the inquiry. This is likely to have been the cause of the argument between the two. The duo started fighting when Suresh went back to the guard room after his duty at the gate got over. 

 Sureshs body has been sent for post-mortem.

 The CRPF has been witness to several incidents of bloodspill within the force, especially in high-tension Kashmir. 

 In 2003, a constable killed two of his colleagues in an indoor stadium in Srinagar after an altercation.

 The next year, Samarendra Deka, in his early twenties, killed seven colleagues in Baramullah, apparently because he was punished for missing a roll call. The killing spree ended when guards shot Deka, who had been with the force for only a year.

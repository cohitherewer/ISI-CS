 Modi rebels

 Vadodara, April 17 (PTI): Stepping up pressure against Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, nearly 50 rebel BJP legislators are planning to meet party chief L.K. Advani, seeking his removal.

 ?The MLAs will wait for a week for Advani to visit the state to listen to their grievances. But if he fails to do so, then we would go to Delhi,? a rebel MLA said.

 A media report about a proposal to appoint Harin Pathak the president of the state BJP sparked anger among the rebel faction.

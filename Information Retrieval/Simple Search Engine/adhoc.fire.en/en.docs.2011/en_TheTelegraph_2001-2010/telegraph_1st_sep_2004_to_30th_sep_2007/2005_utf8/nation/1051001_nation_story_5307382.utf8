 Diwali eyes parking space in New York

 New York, Sept. 30: For Hindus in the Big Apple, Diwali is an issue of street parking.

 So it would seem from the contortions that the community is going through to get the New York City Administration to approve legislation adding Diwali to the list of holidays when street parking rules for this metropolis are suspended.

 New Yorks City Council unanimously voted (45 to 0) on Wednesday to add Diwali to a list of 39 calendar days when cleaning of roads is already suspended here and cars are allowed to be parked on both sides of streets.

 The councils vote came after a large number of Hindus, not only from the subcontinent, but also from Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Malaysia, Fiji and other parts of the diaspora gathered at the City Hall here to demonstrate popular support for the measure.

 Wednesdays vote puts the city council on a collision course with New Yorks mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is opposed to adding Diwali to this list and is widely expected to veto the legislation. He has 30 days to do so.

 Bloombergs spokesperson Jordan Barowitz said the mayor opposed the legislation because it means another day when the streets dont get cleaned.

 Bernard Sullivan, the chief of cleaning at the citys sanitation department, testified before the civic bodys transportation committee last week that adding to this list would greatly impact community cleanliness.

 But the Speaker of the city council, Gifford Miller, said at a press conference before yesterdays vote that Bloomberg did not want to suspend parking rules on Diwali because the city would lose revenue from parking fees and fines, estimated at $306,000.

 The list of 39 days when parking rules are suspended now includes 10 Christian festivals, nine Jewish, two Muslim and the Chinese Lunar New Year.

 Udai K. Tambar, assistant director at the Policy Research Institute at Princeton Universitys Woodrow Wilson School of International and Public Affairs, one of those campaigning for changing the street parking rules for Diwali, acknowledged that those who do not live in New York may find the demand by Hindus strange.

 He explained that the only official religious holiday for New York City is Christmas.

 The suspension of alternate sides parking is considered a recognition of the feast or holiday just short of declaring a city public holiday. It is, in effect, a compromise worked out over decades to avoid expanding the roster of public holidays to accommodate other religious observances, Tambar explained in an e-mail circulated as part the campaign.

 In New York, the issue has drawn so much interest that even academics have entered the debate.

 John Stratton Hawley, Ann Whitney Olin Professor of Religion at Columbia Universitys Barnard College here, wrote to John Liu, chairman of the citys committee on transportation, that passing Diwali legislation will bring the city in line with arrangements that other institutions have made to recognise and celebrate the cultural and religious plurality of our citizenry.

 Such is the interest in the issue that Newsdays story on Diwali parking was written by a reporter who is part of the diaspora, Bryan Virasami.

 The story in yesterdays New York Times was also written by an Asian American. The paper wrote: Just as Manhattan motorists who find themselves racing to the same precious (parking) spot engage in a little verbal road rage, so too have arguments boiled over Diwali.

 According to last years estimates by the Census Bureau, New York Citys Indian population has doubled in little over a decade to more than 213,000. It is not known how many of these are Hindus and there is no ready estimate of the substantial number of Hindus from other parts of the world who live here.

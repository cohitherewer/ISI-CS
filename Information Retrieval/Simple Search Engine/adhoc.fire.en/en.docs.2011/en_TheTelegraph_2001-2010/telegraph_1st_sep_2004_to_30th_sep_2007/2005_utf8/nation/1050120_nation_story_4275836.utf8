 Under cloud, Met boss quits early

New Delhi (PTI): The director-general of the Indian Meteorological 

Department, against whom the wife of a colleague had levelled charges of sexual 

harrasment, has taken voluntary retirement.

 S.K. Srivastava cited personal reasons in his resignation letter to the government, which has been accepted with effect from January 15, official sources said. 

 He had two years to go before reaching the age of superannuation.

 In 2004, the wife of a Met department staffer had complained to police that Srivastava was sexually exploiting her for nearly a decade. She claimed that the Met chief had even arranged a job for her husband in the department.

 Srivastava was granted bail in the case in which the police are yet to file a chargesheet.

 Although the victim had made a complaint to science and technology minister Kapil Sibal in July, his ministry is yet to take any action.

 Speaker push to student role

New Delhi: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee has advised 

students to give up their negative attitude towards politics and come up with 

suggestions that can lead to the country?s development, reports our special correspondent.

 Disappointed to learn that politics was their last resort, Chatterjee told them to stop blaming politicians for India?s problems and start looking into policies responsible for the state of affairs.

 The speaker, who was on Tuesday interacting with a group of students and teachers from Nagpur in the Parliament library, answered questions on several issues. 

 o a query on reservations for Dalits even 58 years after Independence, he said: ?We all have to think about it. Why could we not fulfil the target of uplifting the Dalits within the first 10 years, as envisioned in the Constitution? Why are we lacking in our efforts in that direction??

 When a law student drew his attention to judicial activism, Chatterjee said the judiciary should not cross the lakshman rekha.

 Earlier, inaugurating the eighth biennial conference of the Association of Parliamentary Librarians of Asia and the Pacific, Chatterjee said emergence of democracy and growth in the field of information technology were the most remarkable developments in the last quarter of the previous century. Delegates from 16 countries are taking part in the five-day conference.

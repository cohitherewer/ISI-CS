 Uma resigned to life away from BJP

 - Sympathisers look for saffron support, Congress rival eggs her on to fight Chauhan

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: The resignation of Uma Bharti loyalist Prahlad Patel from the BJP today is a signal that the firebrand leader is resigned to life outside the party.

 Patel, a former Union minister, had been suspended after he supported Umas protest against Shivraj Singh Chauhans ascent as chief minister.

 Uma did appear to make a last-ditch attempt to stage a comeback yesterday by toning down her tirade against elders Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani. But sources close to her say her fate was sealed the day the BJP decided to give Chauhan the Madhya Pradesh crown. 

 Many in the party feel it would have done her good to accept the offer of the general secretarys post. She should have taken it up and waited for a while. She was in too much of a hurry to become chief minister again, said a BJP general secretary.

 The Uma camp believes that by portraying herself as a woman wronged by her parivar (family), she has drawn public sympathy and her muted appeals to Vajpayee and Advani are also a deliberate move in that direction.

 It is clear that she cannot go back to the BJP. First, she has to make the most of the situation she cannot control. The next course of action is to align with a larger cause and exploit the contradictions within the Sangh, said a source.

 The larger cause, as defined by her advisers, is swaraj, swabhiman and swadeshi (self-rule, pride and nationalism), which they expect would endear her to the Sangh. Uma has already embarked on a Ram, Roti yatra to apologise for the BJPs failures. This has won her some support from the VHP, particularly because she has raised the banner of Ram temple once again.

 The parivar components her advisers are banking on are elements in the VHP, her RSS sympathisers and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch of which K.N. Govindacharya is a co-convener. Ashok Singhal of the VHP has already declared his support for her. 

 However, Umas cardinal sin has been that she turned most people who matter, both in the BJP and the RSS, against her. The two Sangh members she had personally targeted ? Suresh Soni and Sanjay Joshi ?? are far too relevant.

 Joshi is an organising secretary in the BJP, which means he is responsible for coordinating between the two organisations. She allegedly circulated damaging letters and CDs about him. Soni is second only to Mohanrao Bhagwat who is arguably the most powerful person in the RSS. Besides, her supporters ? K.N. Govindacharya and S. Gurumurthy ? are out of favour with sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan.

 In the BJP, she has ruffled the feathers of even Vajpayee and Advani, who had so far taken an objective view on her.

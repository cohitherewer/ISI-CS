 US top gun on F-16 mission

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 21: The head of the US foreign military sales authority, who is an F-16 pilot, today told the Indian defence establishment that Washington would fast-track the aircraft?s sale if it was awarded the order for 126 multi-role combat craft for the Indian Air Force.

 The IAF order is one of the largest military orders going in the world. India had sent request for information to SAAB of Sweden for the Gripen, Dassault of France for the Mirage 2000-V, Lockheed Martin for the F-16 and Russia for the MiG29M/M2.

 Lt General Jeffrey B. Kohler said he had conveyed, in his meetings at air headquarters and with defence ministry officials, Washington?s seriousness to win the order with its offers of the F-16 and the Boeing (McDonnel Douglas) F/A-18 Superhornet.

 Kohler said talks on co-development of the aircraft were also likely, with defence minister Pranab Mukherjee scheduled to visit the US next month and the Prime Minister possibly in July. The general said his discussions in Delhi were a preliminary initiative to push for the sales of the aircraft.

 Kohler is a director with the Defense Security Cooperation Agency that supervises all foreign military sales by the US. It has not yet been decided if the offer to sell the F-16 and the Superhornet to India was envisaged as a government-to-government or industry-to-government deal.

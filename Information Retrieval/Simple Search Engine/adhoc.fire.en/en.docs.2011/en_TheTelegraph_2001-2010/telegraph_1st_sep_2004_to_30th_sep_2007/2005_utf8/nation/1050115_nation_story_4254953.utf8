 Rebels kill TDP leader

 Hyderabad, Jan. 14: Maoist rebels have killed a politician and a home guard in a span of 24 hours, in reply to the deaths of two activists in police firing, reports our special correspondent.

 On Wednesday, the rebels had killed a Telugu Desam Party member at Guttikonda in Guntur district. They followed it up last night by shooting 24-year-old home guard Sheikh Nazir at his native village of Gullupalli in Nalgonda district, 210 km from Hyderabad.

 The killings come in the wake of five instances of police firing at armed rebels in the last one week, in which two activists, including a woman, were killed. 

 In another encounter today in Karimnagar district, the police shot dead Naresh, a commander of a Naxalite dalam of the Janashakti faction.

 Three dalam members have been arrested.

 Chandigarh, Dec. 18: Determined to put a stop to the holiday wedding menace, the Centre is preparing a booklet to warn women about NRIs on the prowl.

 An alarming number of women across the country ? Punjab alone accounts for 16,000 ? fall prey to NRIs who marry them only to abandon them a few days later.

 The Union ministry of overseas Indian affairs has put together Marriages to Overseas Indians, which lists some precautions that women must take when considering a marriage proposal from abroad and their rights. The draft of the booklet has been circulated to various states, inviting suggestions.

 The Lok Bhalai Party is the only organisation in Punjab and Haryana to have taken to court more than 1,000 cases of abandoned brides ? or holiday wives ? or found other ways to ensure justice for them and their families.

 It is nothing less than organised crime, said the party chief, Balwant Singh Ramoowali.

 Around 80 per cent of the marriages to NRI men in Punjab are a sham, he added.

 The draft of the booklet contains information on the legal, matrimonial and maintenance rights of women besides guidelines to help them identify and deal with trouble.

 Some precautions in the draft are:

 Do not take a decision 

 in haste or under pressure

 Do not finalise matters 

 on the phone or email or in secrecy

 Do not blindly trust a 

 bureau, agent, tout or middleman 

 Do not agree to forged 

 papers or enter into any fake transaction

 Do not fall for any scheme 

 to migrate to a country other than where the groom stays 

 or the promise of a green card through marriage

 Do not agree to having 

 only a registered marriage or getting it solemnised in a 

 far-off place, especially in a foreign country.

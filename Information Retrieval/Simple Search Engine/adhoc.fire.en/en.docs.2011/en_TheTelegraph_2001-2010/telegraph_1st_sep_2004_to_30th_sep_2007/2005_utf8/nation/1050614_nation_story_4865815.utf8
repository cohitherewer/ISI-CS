 Laloo: Good news

 New Delhi, June 13: As the Congress gets ready for seat talks ahead of the Bihar polls, Laloo Prasad Yadav has a clear edge over Ram Vilas Paswan.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief will no longer have to deal with veteran Congress leaders Arjun Singh and M.L. Fotedar, who had demanded an unrealistic share of seats as the price for a pre-poll alliance in the last Assembly elections.

 For the next round of polls, expected in October-November, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has given the job of reworking the partys strategy to AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh.

 This is good news for Laloo Prasad because Digvijay, a prot?g?-turned-rival of Arjun Singh, is an admirer of the railway ministers brand of politics. 

 Digvijay is known to have been critical of his partys strategy ? built around subtly distancing the Congress from the RJD ? during the February polls.

 Digvijay, who is officially in charge of party affairs in Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, has been working quietly on his new assignment for the past two weeks. He is understood to have held talks with party colleagues, such as Harikesh Bahadur, who were involved in the previous election in Bihar. But a confirmation of his new assignment came only today.

 Digvijay Singh has been asked to initiate talks on Bihar with our state leaders and leaders of other parties for the next Assembly polls, party spokesperson Anand Sharma said. 

 It was not clear whether Paswan, Laloo Prasads arch-rival and Lok Janshakti Party chief, has read the signals from the Congress camp correctly.

 Paswan, who had the Congress on his side in the last round, remains firm about not having any truck with Laloo Prasad. Just a couple of days ago, the RJD had said it was open to a tie-up with Paswan.

 The Lok Janshakti Party will not compromise with the National Democratic Alliance or the Rashtriya Janata Dal in the coming election, Paswan said. The Lok Janshakti Party is in favour of electoral alliances with all the secular forces other than the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 He said he was considering a secular front made up of the Congress, the CPM, CPI and CPI-ML. He has already sent overtures to CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan and CPM leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet. 

 But Digvijay is unlikely to entertain Paswans proposal. Party leaders believe that in the absence of a Congress endorsement, Paswan would no longer be in a position to stick to his anti-Laloo stand. Not after most of the musclemen who were with him in the last election went over to the NDAs Janata Dal (United).

 Congress spokesman Anand Sharma has said the party will try to bring all United Progressive Alliance partners together.

 Contacted in Bhopal, Digvijay said it would a challenging assignment for him as his brief was to bring all the allies on board to put up a united fight against the NDA.

 He said he was talking with the partys central leaders as well as those from Bihar. Once Soniaji returns (from Russia), I shall meet her and give my assessment.

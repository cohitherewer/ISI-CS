 Kurien shuts rivals out

 Kurien: Gate closed

 Ahmedabad, April 15: The power struggle between Verghese Kurien, father of the milk revolution, and his opponents at an institute he created spilled out on the road today.

 Three board members of the Institute of Rural Management at Anand, made famous by Kurien?s milk cooperative Amul, were not allowed to enter the campus to attend a board meeting.

 The security guard at the gate stopped Bakul Dholakia, director of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, saying that he had been ordered to permit only nine directors to enter.

 The two others who got locked out were Hashmukh Shah, former chairman of Indian Petrochemicals Ltd, and industrialist Vijay Mahajan. 

 All three belong to the group on the board which had opposed Kurien?s April 7 sacking of the institute?s director, K. Prathap Reddy, replacing him with L.K. Vaswani as acting director.

 Vaswani is believed to have formally told the trio to stay away from the board meeting scheduled before the institute?s 24th convocation.

 The trio squatted at the gate in protest until the board meeting started. 

 ?A chairman has no individual powers to appoint or terminate the institute?s director. It is for the board of governors to decide,? Dholakia said.

 The institute was set up 25 years ago by Kurien, who is its chairman. 

 When the board meeting started, Amrita Patel, one-time prot?g? of Kurien who has now fallen out with her mentor, questioned the appointment of Vaswani.

 Kurien did not react but two faculty members defended his decision. 

 Patel, who is the chairperson of the National Dairy Development Board, has been locked in a conflict with Kurien for some time over Amul?s marketing practices.

 She and three others walked out of the meeting without signing the minutes. They held a parallel meeting.

 She told reporters later that they discussed fundamental issues like how to uphold the rule of law in the institute.

 Patel alleged that Kurien was driven by ?extraneous factors? and had assumed powers of the board. 

 Kurien is in the midst of several court cases, one of which is against the order of the joint charity commissioner of Vadodara that he cannot be lifetime chairman of the institute.

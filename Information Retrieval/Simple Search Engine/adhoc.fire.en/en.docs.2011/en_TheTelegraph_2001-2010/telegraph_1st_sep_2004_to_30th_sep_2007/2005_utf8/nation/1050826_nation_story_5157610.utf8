 Cola genie uncorked again

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: It seems the cola woes will never end.

 After claims that their drinks contained pesticide and the subsequent notices to cola majors, the Supreme Court was told today that the drinks contained E. coli, a lethal bacteria.

 Santosh Mittal, who had filed a public interest litigation, told a bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices G.P. Mathur and P.K. Balasubramanyan that the Rajasthan government has warned through newspapers that the bacteria has been found in cola drinks.

 The court told Mittal not to go by newspaper reports and file the relevant material... even if it is (a) government one. It refused to issue notices to the state government.

 Earlier, senior counsel Harish Salve, who appeared for PepsiCo, contended that milk sold in India has faecal matter, arsenic and organisms worse than pesticide. Then should we not announce in every packet of milk that it contains faecal matter? he asked.

 Milk products from India have a considerable foreign market and if we are compelled to print that the milk contained permissible faecal matter, we would suffer, Salve told the bench.

 The cola majors plea came in response to a Rajasthan High Court directive to print a cigarette-type warning on every bottle that it contained pesticides. The directive came on a PIL by Mittal, seeking more stringent measures.

 Mittal and another petitioner argued that like the contents of medicines written on the label of the bottle or strips, contents of cola drinks, too, should be written.

 When senior counsel Ashok Desai rose to submit that a draft bill was being introduced in Parliament today, repealing most of the sections of the existing food adulteration act, the court said the bill, too, would be taken up for consideration.

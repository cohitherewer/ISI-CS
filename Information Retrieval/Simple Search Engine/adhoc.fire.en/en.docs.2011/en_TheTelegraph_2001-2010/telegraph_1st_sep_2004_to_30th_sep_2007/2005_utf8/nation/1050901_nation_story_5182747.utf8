 Cry against right to information 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Aug. 31: The Right to Information Act has not gone down well with the influential IAS lobby in Madhya Pradesh, which thinks the act is more a right to harassment than a law to encourage transparency in administration. 

 The collectors feel that peoples use of the act could affect the quality of work in districts, and so are bitterly opposed to it. 

 At a two-day seminar on the right to information, several district collectors expressed apprehension over possible misuse of the act and the ill effects of a transparent and accountable system. 

 Under the act, any citizen can demand information or any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, orders and similar data held in any electronic form and also information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force. They have a right to inspect work, documents and records. 

 Speakers at the seminar, however, opposed the act pointing to paucity of funds, staff, power shortage and lack of education among poorer sections of society and the possibility of vested interests misusing the information.

 One collector complained that photocopy machines are not available in several villages, while a lady official remarked that in the name of accountability, please do not outsource your chair. 

 But Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur, who was present when some of the collectors described the Right to Information Act as right to harassment, said: You administrative officers are solely responsible for effective enforcement of the Right to Information Act.

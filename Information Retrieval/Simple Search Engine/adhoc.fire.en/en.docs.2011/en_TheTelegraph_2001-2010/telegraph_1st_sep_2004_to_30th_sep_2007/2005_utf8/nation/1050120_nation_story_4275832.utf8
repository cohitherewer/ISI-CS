 Happy, simply to be alive

 - Three weeks on, Galle still looks a bombed-out war zone

 Galle, Jan. 19: Athula had a simple, small but adequate home by the beach. He earned a living by driving a tuk tuk (auto-rickshaw). Then the tsunami came. It reduced his home to rubble and took his source of livelihood out to sea. 

 Now, Athula hangs around Galle ?s main bus station, guiding drivers to addresses they don?t know, making a little money. He is just happy he survived, as did his family, though they now live at a relief camp in a church. 

 ?I had a tuk tuk. But it is gone. My home is also gone. My friends help,? he says, pointing to the drivers. 

 Life at the seaside resort is just starting to limp back to normal. But the signs of devastation are everywhere. 

 A drive down the coastal road from Colombo to Galle is like moving in a war zone after it has been heavily bombed. The waves have left miles upon miles of debris where buildings once stood. 

 Fishing boats and trawlers are still being salvaged from the sea in Beruwala. 

 Gantota Maha Vidyalaya is one of several seaside schools destroyed by the sea. All that remains of it is a roomful of chairs, piled high on top of each other. There are no children, just the US Army breaking down what remains of the building and clearing it away. 

 Three weeks after the tragedy, articles of clothing, utensils, toys and even mattresses lie around among the rubble. Remains of thriving coastal communities, now mostly indistinguishable trash. 

 Boats broken into pieces lie by the roadside and houses 2 km from the sea have windows shattered. The big restaurants and hotels are repairing the damage but the humble homes are just piles of rubbish. 

 Sudarshi lives right on the beach in Galle. The waves broke down the back wall of her house. Her family is fine and living with her mother. Her husband, brother and father are now putting the house back together. Their personal belongings, whatever could be salvaged, lie in the backyard as Sudarshi and her children sift through them. ?I am okay. My family is okay,? is all Sudarshi says.

 A little farther down the road is another family that was not so lucky. Their flimsy hut was washed away, belongings included. But the old man, his wife, their son, daughter-in-law and grandson refuse to budge. Right in front of the rotting timber, they live in a makeshift tent provided by aid workers. They cannot speak English, but say ?camp? and then shake their heads.

 Mamata at Kalam door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 6: Unfazed by criticism of her behaviour in Parliament, Mamata Banerjee today announced she would go to the President with the infiltration issue she could not raise on Thursday and asked party legislators and councillors to join her in Delhi. 

 A Trinamul Congress delegation will call on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on Monday. Those trying to silence me will not be able to do so. Now we shall take up the matter with the highest authority, she told party colleagues over phone. 

 Mamata, however, could not be reached for comment.

 On Thursday, Mamata threw a sheaf of papers at the Speakers chair after she was barred from raising the issue of illegal Bangladeshi migration. The subject had already been debated in the House.

 Over a dozen Trinamul legislators and councillors ? Javed Ahmed, the leader of the Opposition in Calcutta Municipal Corporation was among them ? left for Delhi today. This will be followed by another team, including chief whip in the Assembly Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay. 

 We have decided to knock on the Presidents door to apprise him of the reign of terror being unleashed by the ruling CPM in Bengal, Chattopadhyay said tonight. 

 Trinamul sources said Mamata had directed party colleagues here to step up a vigorous movement across the state to highlight the humiliation meted out to her in Parliament. A string of protest rallies and dharnas have been lined up for next week, said Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy. 

 Congress support

 State Congress leaders came out in Mamatas support for highlighting real issues concerning Bengal. 

 Mamata acted rightly by trying to highlight such issues as infiltration in the Lok Sabha. But I dont know whether it was proper to talk on the same issue twice in the House, said former PCC chief Somen Mitra, known to be her bete noire. 

 PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya agreed.

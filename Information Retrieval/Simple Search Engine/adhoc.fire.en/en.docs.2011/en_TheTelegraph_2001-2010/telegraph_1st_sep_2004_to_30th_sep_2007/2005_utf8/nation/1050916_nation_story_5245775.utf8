Khusrupur (Patna), Sept. 15: A series of explosions ripped through a makeshift firecracker factory here today, killing 34 people and destroying the two-storeyed building that collapsed in a heap of broken iron and concrete.

 I have counted 32 bodies. We are conducting rescue operations. Details would be available later, said Patna district magistrate B. Rajendra as he sifted through the rubble.

 Two of the victims died in hospital and the toll could rise as many of the injured were in a critical condition. Many of those who died were crushed under the debris.

 The owner of the building and the factory, Hakim Mohammad, has been arrested. Officials said the 60-year-old, otherwise a renowned firecracker man of area, had licence for a much smaller operation and that children below 14 were part of the workforce.

 Hakim said he had the licence needed for the factory. I have lost my family, he added. Most of those who worked were my kin. Residents said nearly 50 people worked in the factory.

 It was like an earthquake that lasted some 15 seconds. Everything shook. The sound was deafening and I did not know what was happening. But moments later I knew it must be the cracker factory. I ran to the spot and small explosions kept happening for at least the next 30 minutes, said a shopkeeper in the busy residential-cum-market area.

 Another resident said the explosions could be heard 1.5 km away.

 The sky was black with smoke and crackers shot up lighting the sky with sparks, said Nagendra Goswami, a witness.

 After the explosions, iron bars jutted out from what was once the roof of the light-green building. 

 Five fire-tenders rushed from Patna, 40 km away, and managed to enter the narrow 10-foot lane and control the blaze that engulfed the building. Ambulances and small vehicles carried away the dead and the injured.

 Residents said part of the blame lies with the local administration.

NATION BRIEFS

 Srinagar, Sept. 29: Jammu and Kashmir High Court today dismissed a PIL seeking transfer of investigations in the Anara Gupta porn CD case to the CBI, reports our correspondent.

 The court said no criminal case existed against Anara and therefore there was no need to refer it to the CBI. The former Miss Jammu was arrested after a porn CD allegedly featuring her was seized. A civil court will consider her claim for damages for alleged defamation, the high court said. 

 New Delhi (PTI): The Union cabinet has extended the service tenure of women pilots and navigators of transport aircraft and helicopters of the Indian Air Force from 10 to 14 years. The decision came as part of a move to meet a shortage of pilots.

Shankaran told the victims and their representatives that it will recommend houses and jobs as in the case of Kashmiri Pandits, reports our correspondent.

 New Delhi: The Centre will set up an Armed Forces Tribunal to deal with complaints and disputes in the services, now totalling nearly 7,500, reports our correspondent. It will also deal with court martials.

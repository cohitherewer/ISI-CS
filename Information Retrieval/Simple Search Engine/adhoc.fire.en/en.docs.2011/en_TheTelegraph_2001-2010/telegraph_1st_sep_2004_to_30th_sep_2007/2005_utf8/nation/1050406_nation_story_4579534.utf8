 Academic in Meera airport replay

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, April 5: Pakistani academic Najma Najam was not as fortunate as her compatriot, actor Meera, when she landed here yesterday.

 The vice-chancellor of Fatima Jinnah Women?s University, Islamabad, was put on a return flight to Dubai after a wait of almost five hours at the international airport here.

 Unlike Najam, Meera had been taken off a return flight to Pakistan on the intervention of the foreign ministry. She, too, had waited six hours in the airport in New Delhi. Both women had landed at a port of entry different from that mentioned in their visas.

 Najam, invited by the Association of Commonwealth Universities to attend its four-day council meeting here, sat through the night at the airport as she was supposed to land in New Delhi.

 Instead, she landed here by an Air-India flight from Dubai at 1.55 am and was put on the return flight around 6.30 am.

 Jai Singh, assistant registrar at the Sree Chitra Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology that is hosting the meeting, said the immigration staff denied Najam entry permit without valid papers.

 Pakistani citizens flying into India have to land either in Chennai, Mumbai or Delhi and proceed further with proper authorisation by whatever mode of transport available.

 The vice-chancellor had travelled as a transit passenger via Dubai and the port of entry stamped on her visa was New Delhi. Thiruvananthapuram was mentioned as her final destination.

 Fellow invitees to the council meeting were left wondering at the nuances of travel formalities between India and Pakistan, especially when both were launching a bus service along the Line of Control in the Kashmir sector.

 ?Our discretion is out of the question but the embarrassment could have been avoided if A-I officials in Dubai had checked her papers and advised her accordingly,? an emigration employee said, citing restrictions regarding Pakistani travellers.

 Sources said that institute director K. Mohandas, who chairs the council, brought the episode to the attention of Governor R.L. Bhatia at the inauguration of the meeting.

 The governor reportedly said he should have been informed immediately so that the travails of the guest could have been mitigated.

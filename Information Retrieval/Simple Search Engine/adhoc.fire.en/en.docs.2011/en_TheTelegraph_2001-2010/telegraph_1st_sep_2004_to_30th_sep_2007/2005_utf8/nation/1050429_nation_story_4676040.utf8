 Promotion denied, suit slapped

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, April 28: An army officer has slapped a Rs 50-lakh damages suit on a heart institute in Delhi for coming in the way of his promotion.

 Lt Col A.B. Dwivedi, after being denied promotion to the rank of colonel, has vented his ire at the hospital, holding it responsible for his ?trauma?.

 Lt Col Dwivedi, deputed at the Paharpur (Gaya) station of the Army Service Corps (N), has lodged a complaint with the Bihar State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, saying that his ?definite promotion to the post of colonel was denied? on account of one of his three blocked arteries remaining unattended during a bypass surgery done at the said hospital.

 In his six-page complaint, the officer has given details of his medical history and alleged that while three of his arteries were found to be blocked, doctors at the hospital worked on only two and left the third one unattended. 

 The anomaly was later detected during a medical test conducted at the army hospital in Delhi.

 According to the complaint, the bypass surgery was conducted on July 21 last year while the review medical test took place on October 1. 

 Following the detection of the anomaly, Lt Col Dwivedi wrote several letters to the hospital authorities, pointing out the doctors? negligence while performing the operation. He also sent a legal notice to the management of the hospital. 

 In its response to the notice, the management denied the allegations. 

 Lt Col Dwivedi complained of heaviness in the chest while being discharged, the complaint said, but the doctors assured him that everything was fine and the minor problems would not remain for long.

 The complainant has annexed four documents in support of his contention that the hospital was responsible for his trauma and denial of promotion. 

 The documents attached by the army officer along with the complaint included the discharge summary given by the heart institute and the medical report of the army hospital in Delhi. 

 Following his complaint, a notice has been sent to the heart institute.

 Convenient, cries BJP

 New Delhi, Nov. 5: With barely a week to go for polling in the third phase of elections in Bihar, the arrest of Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin is being viewed as a gimmick to help Laloo Prasad Yadav polarise Muslim votes. 

 The BJP has alleged that the United Progressive Alliance stage-managed the arrest for the purpose.

 In Patna, its Bihar unit chief, Sushil Modi, said: Laloo is desperate to win over the Muslims, most of whom have drifted away from him. All this is play-acting. It just shows that the UPA is losing steam.

 The party maintains that the manner in which Shahabuddin was arrested ? in his bedclothes by two women police officers ? and the fact that he was conveniently found, after a four-month search, in his official residence here, are indications of the Centres complicity in this drama.

 He has been supposedly absconding for four months. Suddenly, they find him lodged in his official MPs residence. Does it sound credible to you? It goes without saying that he cannot get bail and will be taken to Siwan jail. Elections in Siwan are due in the fourth phase. All this is very convenient, Modi said.

 Rashtriya Janata Dal spokesperson Shivanand Tiwari pledged the partys loyal support to the infamous muscleman. 

 Former Union minister Sanjay Paswan described the manner of Shahabuddins arrest as a violation of his human rights. He was dragged out of his home in his bedclothes. He is an MP. There may be some allegations against him but this is no way to treat him. We will approach the National Human Rights Commission.

 Laloo Prasad has already been saying that the police hunt for Shahabuddin was a clear case of victimisation as he is a Muslim. Eight non-bailable warrants of arrest, the whole police department chasing him. They would have us believe that he is a terrorist not an elected representative from Bihar, he said at a meeting recently.

 The Congress has chosen to maintain a safe distance. The law will take its own course, said general secretary Ambika Soni. She added that if there are criminal charges against an individual, he will be arrested and tried. We have no comments to make on this issue.

 Left set for tryst with Pak top two

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Harkishen Singh Surjeet and A.B. Bardhan are likely to call on Manmohan Singh?s economist-turned-politician counterpart in Pakistan and the man who brought him to power when they visit that country this month-end.

 The Left leaders? date with Shaukat Aziz and Pervez Musharraf is not yet decided but the speculation is it may take place on March 1.

 The CPM general secretary and his CPI counterpart have been invited by three Pakistani parties ? the Mazdoor Kisan Communist Party of Pakistan, the Communist Party of Pakistan and the National Workers Party ? for friendly interactions.

 Surjeet and Bardhan will leave Delhi on February 24 for their first visit to Pakistan since Musharraf?s rise to power in what appears to be part of Track II diplomacy.

 The Left believes that bilateral relations will improve through people-to-people contact and friendly interactions between the countries? political parties. Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav had been a great ?hit? when he visited Pakistan during the NDA regime?s tenure.

 The Pakistani Prime Minister had called on the CPM and CPI leadership the last time he visited India. Their leadership knows the Left can play a major role in moulding the United Progressive Alliance government?s decisions on bilateral relations in view of its crucial support to the coalition.

 The Pakistani leadership also perceives the Left as more liberal and not warmongers, which make them vital for advocating a peaceful dialogue.

 The CPM?s latest draft political resolution clarifies its approach: ?It is essential for both India and Pakistan to sort out their problems through a bilateral dialogue.?

 The resolution stresses this has become especially significant because both India and Pakistan are willing to make the US the ?arbiter?.

 The Pakistani leadership is also interested in the Left because it feels the latter can reach out to a broader constituency in India through Left and socialist parties.

 Surjeet and Bardhan?s likely meeting with Musharraf will also give the Pakistani communist parties some visibility, a Left leader here said.

 These parties have limited membership ? mostly among the peasantry, working class and intellectuals ? and cannot carry out any major activity under the prevailing political circumstances there. ?Half of them are under cover,? the Left leader said.

 Their leaders have been invited by the CPM and the CPI to their respective party congresses scheduled in April.

 Rane at Pawar door for Sena war

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, July 7: Expelled leader Narayan Rane has knocked on the Nationalist Congress Partys doors to take on his former boss Bal Thackeray.

 Rane, who continues to be leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly even after his expulsion from the Shiv Sena last Sunday, reached here late last night to garner support of the NCP and also the Congress.

 As NCP chief Sharad Pawar is away in Brazil, Rane is understood to have discussed his plans for the battle within the 63-member Sena legislature party with the Union agriculture ministers confidant Praful Patel, the minister of state for civil aviation.

 For the record, however, both Rane and Patel have denied that they met during the expelled leaders nine-hour stay here. Rane today claimed he had come to the national capital for legal consultation.

 In Mumbai, Thackeray paraded over 50 party legislators before Speaker Babasaheb Kupekar today and pressed him to recognise Ramdas Kadam as Sena leader in the Assembly and thus also as the leader of Opposition in Ranes place.

 But Rane, who claims the support of 40 legislators, said most of the 52 MLAs (paraded before the Speaker today) are being held at a suburban hotel against their will. 

 The NCP backing is crucial for Rane as the Speaker belongs to it. Unless Kupekar recognises Kadam as the Sena legislature party leader, Rane can legally force Sena MLAs to obey his order in the House.

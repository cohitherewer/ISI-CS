 New Delhi, March 23: Green and feminist warriors may have found a champion in the Prime Minister?s household ? Gursharan Kaur, wife of Manmohan Singh. 

 Kaur, who made her maiden public speech today, nearly 10 months after her husband took over, promised a surprised audience of about 100 businesswomen and wives of IFS officers that she would take up with Singh the issue of involving women in protecting the environment and sustaining development in rural India.

 Unlike the West, Indian Prime Ministers? wives have tended to stay in the background and have rarely gone public on any issue, least of all on gender or environmental matters. 

 Like Kaur, most have been homemakers and not working women.

 But the Singh family has always been environmentally conscious and Daman, the second of the Prime Minister?s three daughters, has a book on environmental issues to her credit.

 Kaur was speaking at a seminar on women, environment and development organised by Assocham and the External Affairs Spouses? Association.

 Bejewelled women from the Modi, Singhania and Mittal business families, the Pakistani high commissioner?s wife Aisha Khan and the Indian foreign secretary?s wife, Anita Saran, were among her audience.

 In her candid little speech, Kaur admitted she was no expert on the subject, but said she was expressing her concerns on environmental degradation and the need for sustainable development as a ?conscious citizen?.

 ?(The) Chipko movement, for example, has proved to be successful because women were behind it,? she said. 

 Rural women should be emulated by those living in cities for environment protection ?as history has recorded their contribution in this field, the volume of which is much larger?, Kaur added.

 Her point was that with 33 per cent reservation already in place for women in the panchayati raj system, the issue of their larger involvement in environment protection and sustainable development should be taken up with the Prime Minister.

 ?A society with empowered women can cope far better with environmental crisis and, importantly, women are taking the lead. We should recognise their power,? she said.

 Kaur stressed, perhaps tongue in cheek, that some ?positive changes? could be expected with ?some changes in lifestyle and attitude? because most of the problems are man-made.

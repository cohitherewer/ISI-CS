 BJP plans solo show in TN

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, April 30: The BJP ?will go it alone? in the 2006 Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu.

 This announcement came from L.K. Advani today during a state BJP convention in suburban Chromepet. 

 There was thunderous applause by BJP workers when their chief said the party was ?determined to usher in a new positive political culture in Tamil Nadu?. For this it would fight on ?its own strength?, staying clear of the main Dravidian parties ? the DMK headed by M. Karunanidhi and the Jayalalithaa-led ADMK.

 BJP vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu, general secretary Pramod Mahajan, national secretary L. Ganesan and state president C.P. Radhakrishnan were also present.

 Advani emphasised the party?s decision to fight the polls on its own wasn?t due to any compulsion and in the same breath clarified that ?going it alone? did not mean that the BJP would treat regional parties as untouchables. ?Never in the history of the BJP has it in principle been against alliances? though the Congress until recently would not even touch regional parties with a barge pole, he said. 

 The implicit message was the party would be open to post-poll alliances if the situation so demanded.

 Mahajan will stay in Chennai, and with Naidu, who hails from nearby Nellore, will oversee the preparations for the state polls. 

 Advani said the BJP parliamentary board?s decision on the polls was based on the report submitted by the two to the party leadership after their recent chintan baithak in Chennai with the state party cadre and office-bearers. 

 Advani said the BJP respected ?Dravidian culture? and the temples of Tamil Nadu, which have made their rich contribution to Indian heritage. But, similarly, a regional perspective ?has to be reconciled with a pan-Indian, Bharatiya, holistic national perspective?. 

 In the BJP?s assessment, ?there is a wide constituency in Tamil Nadu? which is yearning for a harmonious blend of three broad factors, he said.

 One, the commitment to nationalism, which was seen in freedom fighters like Veerapandi Kattabomman, poet Subrahmanya Bharathi and Rajaji. The second factor was the ?respect for India?s regional diversity, like the concern for the Tamil language and culture? and the third was the ?ennobling impact of religiosity on individuals and on society as a whole?, Advani said.

 Ranchi burns in NDA wrath

 OUR BUREAU

 March 2: The streets of Jharkahnd resembled a war zone as angry NDA supporters resorted to violence all over the state after the governor called JMM chief Shibu Soren to take oath as chief minister. 

 After burning effigies and smashing windscreens, the NDA supporters called a Ranchi bandh tomorrow followed by an indefinite chakka jam.

 The supporters gathered on almost all the important streets and roundabouts and targeted both public and private vehicles. As the news spread, all shops on the busy Albert Ekka Chowk downed shutters. It was the same at Lalpur Chowk, Dang- ratoli Chowk and Rajendra Chowk.

 Riot control vehicles had to be placed at sensitive spots. 

 The spark came near Raj Bhavan where supporters of the rival camps had gathered since last evening. 

 The JMM and Congress supporters began to celebrate as soon as news filtered out that Soren had been invited to form the government.

 The celebrations left the NDA supporters fuming and soon they took to the roads. An autorickshaw heading towards Main Road was the first to taste their wrath. 

 ?What the governor did is totally unconstitutional. It is a known fact that we have got the majority. But even then we were not invited. We are not going to tolerate this. He has to take his decision back. Otherwise, Ranchi will never ever forget the coming days,? shouted one of them.

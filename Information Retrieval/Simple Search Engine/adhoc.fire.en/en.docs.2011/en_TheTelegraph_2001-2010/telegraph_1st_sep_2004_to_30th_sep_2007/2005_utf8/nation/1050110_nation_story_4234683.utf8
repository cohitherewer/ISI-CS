 Gaur guns for English

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Jan. 9: Taking the cue from Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav, chief minister Babulal Gaur has decided to play the rustic and oppose the use of English in Madhya Pradesh.

 Under pressure from Uma Bharti to vacate his chair, Gaur turned his ire at the state?s veterinarians and bureaucrats at a seminar here today, accusing them of having a ?slave mentality?.

 The chief minister said he was ?scandalised? to see that a seminar on animal welfare organised by the state-run Academy of Administration had its souvenir, invitation card, banner and literature prepared in English. 

 ?I say, how many understand this alien language?? Gaur asked academy director J.L. Bose. 

 The irony was that in a fit of anger, the chief minister himself switched to English, saying: ?Bose sahib, this is not good.?

 Gaur had several ?words of wisdom? for vets, bureaucrats and the society in general. Here are a few samples:

 On trips to rural areas, 

 wear a dhoti-kurta instead of a coat and tie. Go 

 as a simple man.

 If there are no complaints 

 against veterinarians, it means they are not working. No 

 complaint means no work. I have never met a vet during my 

 tours to rural areas.

 Service to animals is 

 greater than service to mankind as animals cannot speak 

 and express their agony.

 The cattle population is 

 falling in Madhya Pradesh. There are only 1.75 lakh cows 

 and 75,000 buffaloes in a state with a population of over 

 six crore.

 Men would stop getting 

 tea at home if women switch from sari-blouse to pant-shirt.

 No woman will extend help 

 in domestic chores if ramp culture becomes part of Indian 

 culture.

 Many participants, however, spoke out against the chief minister?s opposition of English. M. Rajashekhar from Bangalore, a project director on animal disease monitoring and surveillance, said the literature was in English because many scientists from non-Hindi speaking states are attending the seminar.

 Moreover, a scientific topic like ?various animal diseases and their field management? could be dealt with only in English, he added.

 A senior state minister loyal to Uma too, objected to Gaur?s stand, claiming that the chief minister was trying to ?ape? Laloo Prasad and Mulayam Singh to sustain his support base after tendering an apology for speaking out against his predecessor.

 Gaur?s detractors said Uma, during her tenure as chief minister, had tried to promote English in Madhya Pradesh. 

 Pointing at a BJP document, Hamari Didi ? a profile of the former chief minister ? a minister recalled that it had commended the sadhvi?s ability to speak ?farratedar (fluent)? English.

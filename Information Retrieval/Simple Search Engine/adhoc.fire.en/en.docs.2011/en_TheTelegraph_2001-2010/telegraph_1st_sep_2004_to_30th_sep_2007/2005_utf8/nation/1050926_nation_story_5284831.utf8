 Climbers killed in avalanche

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gangtok, Sept. 25: Four climbers were killed and two went missing after an avalanche struck them during an attempt to scale the Chhomu Yamu peak in north Sikkim yesterday.

 The additional district collector of North district, Namrata Thapa, said today that the 10-member team comprised officers from Punjab police. Four bodies have been recovered and two climbers are still untraced. Four of the climbers have been taken to an army camp, Thapa said. With communication badly hit because of heavy rains since last evening, more details are awaited.

 An army spokesperson said the team had been asked not to proceed because of the inclement weather. Our team, which went to the spot where the avalanche took place, had to abandon search as the weather turned bad once again.

 The peak is more than 100 km from here and said to be nearly 20,000 feet high. 

 The bodies are yet to be identified and they will be brought to Mangan, the headquarters of North district tomorrow for post-mortem, Thapa said.

 She was not sure of the names of the survivors or those missing. Parash Moni Das, inspector-general of police, Punjab, and an Everester, is one of the members of the team.

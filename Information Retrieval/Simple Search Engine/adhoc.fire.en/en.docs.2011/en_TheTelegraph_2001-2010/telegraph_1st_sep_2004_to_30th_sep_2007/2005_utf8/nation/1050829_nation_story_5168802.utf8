 Blueprint on table for kinder displacement

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: As Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee gets set to acquire hundreds of acres for the development of Bengal, Sonia Gandhi is pushing the cause of the displaced in Delhi.

 The National Advisory Council headed by Sonia has proposed changes in the Land Acquisition Act to make it more displaced-people-friendly. It has also suggested setting up a National Rehabilitation Commission. 

 N.C. Saxena, a member of the council set up to oversee implementation of the common minimum programme by the Centre, underlined the need for a national policy for relief and rehabilitation that was caring and not impoverishing in a Power Point presentation at a meeting on Friday.

 Forty million persons have been displaced since 1940 on account of development projects, of which 40 per cent are tribals. Less than 40 per cent have been rehabilitated and the rest have been pauperised by the development process, Saxena, who was secretary, Planning Commission, and secretary, rural development, told the council meeting.

 The rural development ministry will go through the presentation and, if necessary, return it to the council for clarifications and elaboration.

 According to the presentation, the Land Acquisition Act should be renamed as the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation Act to project a humane face. The law should derive from Article 21 of the Constitution because the right to life implies the right to means to sustain life, including livelihood, shelter and habitat, Saxena said.

 In Bengal, chief minister Bhattacharjees decision to hand over land to Indonesias Salim Group for building an economic zone has caused disquiet in the Left. 

 The land act should be redrafted to spell out a detailed rehabilitation plan, Saxena said. Once such a plan is in place, the law should require mandatory rehabilitation clearance by the prescribed authority before land can be acquired. 

 Laying down a set of guiding principles to help frame the amendments, he said: Displacement, as a rule, should not be forced but based on prior informal consultation. Forced displacement of people should only be permitted in the rarest of rare cases. People likely to be affected most must be given the due opportunity of information and hearings, and allowed to examine all aspects of the project, including the public purpose.

 The amended law must define public purpose as public good, which must include welfare of the affected people. Affected people can be defined as those who are either displaced or lose 35 per cent or more of their assets and income, the council member said.

 The Land Acquisition Act was bereft of provisions to compensate the loss of livelihood, shelter, habitat, cultural and natural resources and basic amenities, Saxena said. 

 The acquired property was usually under-valued on the basis of past sale deeds. The problem was compounded by faulty land records and other legal flaws which prevented farmers from selling their land directly.

 To overcome these shortcomings, Saxena suggested that the compensation be paid much before a person was displaced and the amount determined according to the operative market rates.

 It was incumbent on the act to ensure that the displaced persons were better off, not just in economic terms, but also in terms of human development and skills in a reasonable time and that they were brought above the poverty line.

 Saxena also called for a rehabilitation commission which would have the statutory responsibility for assessing all projects that displace more than 100 people and be statutorily empowered to clear such projects. 

 The commission, he said, would monitor the projects and impose sanctions. It could be set up through an act of Parliament.

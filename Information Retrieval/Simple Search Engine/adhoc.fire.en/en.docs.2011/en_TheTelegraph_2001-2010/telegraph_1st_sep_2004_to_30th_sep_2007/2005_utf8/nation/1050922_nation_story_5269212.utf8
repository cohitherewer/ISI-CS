 Assam court suspense ends

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Sept. 21: The suspense over Binod Kumar Roys continuation as chief justice of Gauhati High Court has ended with the President shifting him after an eight-month controversial tenure.

 Roy, who has been on leave since August 21, will be the chief justice of Sikkim High Court. His transfer was notified yesterday by the Union ministry of law and justice immediately after receiving the Presidents assent.

 Justice Dinendra Biswas will be the acting chief justice till such time that a regular appointment is made, the notification said.

 The countdown to Roys transfer began on July 12 with 15 of his 17 fellow judges formally complaining to the Chief Justice of India about his conduct, which, they alleged, was unbecoming of a judge and a blot on the judiciary. A similar complaint by 151 lawyers bolstered the case.

 Roy went on leave immediately after the Supreme Court collegium recommended his transfer to Sikkim High Court. Sources said a stormy welcome awaits Roy in Sikkim with the government there opposing his appointment. 

 The law ministrys notification said he had been asked to assume charge in Sikkim by September 30. Roy was unavailable for comment.

 Judges and lawyers of Gauhati High Court first made their feelings about Roy known after a delay in issuing the list which details cases to be taken up in a day and in which room, on July 27. They accused him of often making last-minute changes, throwing the court into turmoil.

 In its representation to the Chief Justice of India, the Gauhati High Court Bar Association said: The new chief justice... has considerably vitiated the atmosphere and it has adversely affected the functioning of the high court.

 His manner of conducting... proceedings leaves much to be desired and there is a fear... that if things are allowed to go on as it is, the institution will suffer irreparable damage.

 Mischief at Puri shrine

 Puri, Feb. 20 (PTI): A lawyer was arrested for allegedly misbehaving with a 16-year-old girl inside the sanctum sanctorum of the Jagannath temple here today.

 Biswajit Senapati, 35, was arrested and the court of local sub-divisional judicial magistrate Ratikanta Mohapatra remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days.

 The incident occurred when a large crowd entered the shrine for the darshan.

 Several sevayats gathered around Senapati after the girl shouted and accused him of trying to molest her.

 The girl came with her family members from Hooghly district of Bengal, sources said.

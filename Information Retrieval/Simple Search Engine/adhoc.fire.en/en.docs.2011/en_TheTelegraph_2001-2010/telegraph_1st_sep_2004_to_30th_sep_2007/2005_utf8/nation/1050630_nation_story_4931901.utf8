 Tax-struck Bollywood waves black money red rag

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 29: Extortion! cried ad film-maker Prahlad Kakkar, reacting to the Maharashtra governments decision to levy a showbiz stamp duty.

 Kakkar, who works with some of the biggest stars of the film and sporting world, said: This is legally contestable. When you sign a contract for transfer of property, you charge a stamp duty. But how can intellectual property be charged with a levy. I am not selling a physical property, I am offering a service.

 Director Mahesh Bhatt said measures like these would hurt the film industry at a time when it is attempting to be a global player.

 They say you cant avoid two things in life ? death and taxes. I am opposed to this on a single principle ? the lack of vision on part of the government. It is not about paying the levy. The government should give wings to the industry at this point, but all it thinks about is how to milk it for revenue, 

 Actor Suniel Shetty, who returned to Mumbai from a shooting locale this evening, termed the tax ridiculous. The government should pay us a fee for entertaining people. The whole black (money) and white thing will happen again. People will try to show smaller amounts on contracts. I wont mind if they levy a fee and control film piracy, Shetty said.

 Piracy has been robbing the industry of a sizeable chunk of revenue, but the government has done little to fight the menace. 

 But the sharpest reaction came from actor Jaya Bachchan. 

 This is ridiculous. I will go to Ooty and sign the contract. The Hindi (film) industry will soon move out of Maharashtra. Let them make only Marathi films, the actor, who advises the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh on developing the local film industry, told reporters.

 UTV chief Ronnie Screwvala is not happy with the decision either.

 The entertainment industry is a strong bread earner. We also understand that the government is facing a challenging time balancing its revenues versus its expenditure.

 But this is double whammy. We are paying a service tax already. Maharashtra has the highest entertainment tax. We will urge the government to reconsider, he said.

 Other industry leaders said that after years of being in the unorganised sector where black money was the currency, the entertainment industry had begun moving towards corporatisation. The levy would force the industry to seek the easier way out, they added.

 Pahlaj Nihalani, the president of the Association of Motion Picture amp; TV Programme Producers, said the film industry was already reeling under a tax regime that includes sales tax, excise duty on raw stock, service tax and value added tax. 

 Countries like the UK are providing subsidies if we shoot 90 per cent of the movie in their country, but our own government is bent on finishing the industry, Nihalani said.

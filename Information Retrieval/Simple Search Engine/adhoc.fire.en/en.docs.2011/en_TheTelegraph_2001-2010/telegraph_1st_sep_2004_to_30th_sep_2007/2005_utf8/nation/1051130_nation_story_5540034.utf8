 Defiant sadhvi hits the road

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Nov. 29: Shivraj Singh Chauhan today took oath as Madhya Pradesh chief minister as predecessor Uma Bharti began another yatra looking for a future outside the BJP. 

 Unless some last-minute drama alters her imminent expulsion, Uma is set to float an outfit in which former BJP ideologue K. Govindacharya would play a pivotal role. 

 The sadhvis associates have already felt the central BJP leaderships heat with former Union minister Prahlad Patel and five others being showcaused and suspended for misconduct.

 Uma, though, seemed unfazed. I am the BJP, she declared minutes before leaving for her Ram, Roti yatra. 

 Making light of Pramod Mahajans warning of disciplinary action, Uma wondered why the BJP was making a distinction between the sheep ? meaning leaders like her ? and the bull ? meaning leaders like Arun Jaitley and Mahajan. She also dared the central leadership to take action against her, adding that because she stood for swadeshi, swaraj and swabhimaan she was the real BJP. 

 Asked to comment on former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees statement that indiscipline in the party would not be tolerated, Uma shot back, attacking Mahajan and other leaders. 

 How about taking action against Pramod Mahajan who had written in the BJP Today against the Narendra Modi government? the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister retorted. Without taking names, she asked: Who was the law minister and the home minister when Sonias foreign origin issue was not taken up properly by the NDA regime? Who gave up the Ayodhya issue and the scrapping of Article 370? 

 She also raised questions on the Vajpayee regimes acceleration of economic reforms at the expense of swadeshi. 

 Umas roadshow from Bhopal, however, failed to woo even her die-hard supporters. When she began her march, there were not even 500 supporters for her in the state that gave her a three-fourth mandate a couple of years ago. 

 Her roadside meetings only had curious onlookers, not her old faithfuls from the BJP, RSS and the VHP. 

 Camping in Bhopal to blunt Umas attack, Mahajan said a meeting of the BJP parliamentary board has been called in Delhi tomorrow to decide on the sadhvis fate. 

 Prahlad Patel and the five others have been asked to explain why they should not be expelled from the BJP for their misconduct at the legislature party meeting yesterday. 

 Mahajan said notices would be issued to all the MLAs who walked out of the meeting in which Chauhan was elected chief minister, netting 157 out of 172 votes.

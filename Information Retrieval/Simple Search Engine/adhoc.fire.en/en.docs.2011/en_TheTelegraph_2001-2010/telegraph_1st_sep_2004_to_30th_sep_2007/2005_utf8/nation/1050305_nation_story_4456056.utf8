 Kashmir bus pass

 OUR BUREAU

 March 4: Security agencies have asked the government to stick to a 15-day permit for passengers travelling by the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus, slated for its first ride on April 7 and impose a restriction on the number of places that they can visit.

 The regional passport office in Srinagar today started distributing forms for travel on the bus ? nearly 150 forms were distributed ? but the forms do not mention the duration for which the permit will be issued. Instead, the form enquires about the duration for which the permit is required. Security agencies say a firm decision on this issue needs to be taken in consultation with Islamabad.

 The Union home ministry had recommended that the bus travellers be given permits valid for a fortnight, arguing that the duration could be increased after evaluating experiences during the trial run.

 Officials insist that they would also have to arrive at an agreement with Islamabad on the number of places that can be visited by people from across the LoC. Tentatively, an intelligence official said, they were deliberating at restricting travel to not more than five places.

 But travellers will not be allowed to stay overnight at any place other than the declared areas. As soon as they reach their destination, they will have to report their arrival to the local police station. If they want to stay overnight at a relative?s place elsewhere in the Valley, they can do so only if they have declared this intention in their form. 

 Besides, they will have to notify the local police station again.

 Islamabad, the official said, too, was comfortable with this format as it enabled security agencies in the two countries to keep a close watch on the movements of the passengers.

 In Srinagar, applicants lined up early today at the regional passport office to get the forms. ?I am all ready to join my relatives across the LoC. After a lifelong wait, my dream is coming true,? said a local resident, Mohammad Shafi.

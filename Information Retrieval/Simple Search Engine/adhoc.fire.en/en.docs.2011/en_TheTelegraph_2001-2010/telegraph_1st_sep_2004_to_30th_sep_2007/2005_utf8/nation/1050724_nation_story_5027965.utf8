 A stitch in time to stop lock-up suicides

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 23: After enlisting street dogs in the battle against Maoists, the state police chief has had another bright idea.

 This time he wants to end the spiralling lock-up suicides that give the police a bad name. His solution: force the accused to spend the night in shorts or pyjamas.

 Males kept in police lock-ups should be given khaki half-pants or pyjamas; the females should wear salwar kameez, director-general of police Swaranjit Sen told superintendents of police at a meeting here today.

 This way, they wont have the lungis and sarees with which they hang themselves in lock-ups.

 Sen had hit the headlines early this year by suggesting to his subordinates that they patronise street dogs in Maoist-affected areas. These animals, he said, would alert them whenever strangers (rebels) came near police stations.

 Today, he came up with another formula: go on the offensive against the guerrillas. Why should you wait for the Maoists to attack your police station? he told the district police bosses. You should take the lead and attack the enemies of public peace and development.

 The police chief also advised his juniors on how to tackle the media. Read newspapers but dont take what they write seriously enough to react. You can trust the TV channels but not the print media, he said.

 The meeting discussed ways of containing the Maoist menace in the state. Cash compensation will be given to families of those the Maoists kill after labelling them police informers, Sen said.

 The practice is in vogue in Chhattisgarh, where the families of informers either killed or maimed by Naxalites receive cash from the state police.

 The Andhra Pradesh government already provides ex gratia to people killed in police-Maoist crossfire.

 The meeting discussed the need for again declaring cash awards for information on Maoist leaders, because the Naxalites have stepped up attacks in rural areas. 

 The cash awards were withdrawn during the dialogue with Maoists, which began in October 2004.

 At a joint meeting of district police bosses and district collectors, the police suggested a joint development effort with revenue officials. A time-bound, two-year programme will improve living conditions in the villages and thus check the Maoists growth, the meeting felt.

 Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys Congress government has almost given up its efforts to pursue peace talks with the Naxalites. Some 310 people ? 130 guerrillas, 150 politicians and 30 police personnel ? have been killed in Maoist-related violence in the state this year.

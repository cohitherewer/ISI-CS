 HC ruling on society charges

 New Delhi, July 31 (PTI): Delhi High Court has ruled that an allottee has to pay maintenance charges to the cooperative society even if the flat is not occupied. 

 The maintenance charges are paid for the upkeep of the society and the flats. Whether or not a flat is occupied or utilised has no bearing on the liability for the payment of maintenance charges, Justice Mukul Mudgal said.

 The central government Services Co-operative Land and Group Housing Societies Ltd had cancelled allotment of petitioner S. Gulshanjit Singh Ahluwalias LIG flat because he failed to clear the maintenance charges.

 His counsel had submitted he was not required to pay any maintenance charges as he did not occupy the flat.

 Justice Mudgal said: The petitioner has been allotted an LIG flat and whether or not he chooses to occupy the flat, he cannot be heard to say as an allottee that the maintenance charges shall not be paid as he does not occupy the LIG flat.

 The court set aside the cancellation of his flat subject to the petitioner clearing the arrears of maintenance charges in six weeks. It also restored Ahluwalias membership of the society and asked him to clear dues in four weeks.

 Ahluwalia had applied for an HIG flat but the society allotted it to someone else in violation of a court order. The additional collector, co-operative societies, had on July 6, 1990, asked the society to allot him an LIG flat immediately and make arrangements for an HIG flat for him. 

 The court said his right to an HIG flat subsists.

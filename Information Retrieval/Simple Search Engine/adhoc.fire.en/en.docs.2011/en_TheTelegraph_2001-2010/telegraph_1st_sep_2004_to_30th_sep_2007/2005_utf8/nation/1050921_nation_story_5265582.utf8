 Israelis fined for kissing 

 Ajmer, Sept. 20 (PTI): A local court today fined an Israeli couple who had been arrested for kissing in public at Pushkar ghat. 

 The judicial magistrate court at Pushkar slapped a fine of Rs 500 each on Alone and Selev who, according to the court, had committed an act of indecency by kissing in public after their marriage. 

 The Pushkar Purohit Sangh had lodged a complaint with police on September 6, alleging they had hurt Hindu sentiments by kissing in front of other devotees in a semi-naked condition soon after their marriage was solemnised. 

 The police had registered a case against the couple under Section 294 of the IPC and arrested them. They were later released on bail on personal bonds. 

 The couple in their written statement filed yesterday, said though they got married according to Hindu rituals, they kissed following their own culture. 

 Saying they were unaware that kissing in public was prohibited in India, the couple denied that they were in a semi-naked condition at the time of marriage.

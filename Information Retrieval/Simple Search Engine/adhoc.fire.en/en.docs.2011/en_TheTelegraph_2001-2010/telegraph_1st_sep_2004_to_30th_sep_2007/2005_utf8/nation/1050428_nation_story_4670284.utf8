 Pervez on PR drive

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, April 27: General Pervez Musharraf has embarked on a public relations drive to resolve the ?complex? Jammu and Kashmir dispute.

 ?The decades-old Kashmir problem is complex and I need the nation?s support on moving towards its resolution,? he said during a television programme, Roo Baroo, or face to face. Given the complexity of the issue, the President said it would require great efforts to push it forward towards a solution.

 Musharraf, who visited India earlier this month and held talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, defended his stand on Kashmir, saying Pakistan?s policy on the issue has not changed.

 On Monday, a prominent Kashmiri militant leader, Syed Salahuddin, had accused Musharraf of sidelining the decades-old dispute while India has stood its ground.

 Reaffirming his commitment to the Kashmiri cause, Musharraf said: ?My intention is clear? and I want to ease the troubles of Kashmiris.? He also denied taking a U-turn on Kashmir. ?Why do I need to take a U-turn for any reason?? he said. ?Our position is very clear and we want to find a solution acceptable to Pakistan, India and Kashmiris.? 

 He added: ?I want to resolve the issue once and for all and with all sincerity.?

 Musharraf believes the Kashmir dispute has cost India more. It is not only enduring military and financial losses, but its ?international image is also suffering because of the continued human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir?, he said.

 The President also referred to the plight of Kashmiris and said his efforts are aimed at reducing their sufferings.

 A joint statement issued at the end of Musharraf?s India trip called the peace process ?irreversible?. During their talks, which Pakistan foreign ministry officials described as ?historic and landmark?, Musharraf and Singh also agreed to continue the efforts to resolve all problems, including Kashmir.

 HC scanner on literary awards

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 30: The Orissa Sahitya Akademi Awards were mired in a controversy after the high court yesterday cancelled three of the eight awards for the year 2000 as they were not in keeping with the rules.

 The division bench of Chief Justice Sujit Burman Roy and Justice M.M. Das cancelled the awards for three books ? Mu Rigoberta Menchu, Sarthak Sarathi and Sramana Ra Pruthibi. While Aurobindo Behera had translated the first one, Gobinda Chandra Bhuyan and Archana Naik had penned the other two books. Behera, a senior bureaucrat, is the forests and environment secretary at present.

 The judges have ordered the akademi to start afresh the selection of books for those three awards.

 In 2002, the akademi had announced the awards for Mu Rigoberta Menchu for best translation work, Sarthak Sarathi for being a biography of former chief minister J.B. Patnaik and Sramana Ra Pruthibi for being the best literary creation.

 Madhaba Mishra, a member of Utkal Sammilani, a leading socio-literary organisation in the state, had challenged the awards on the ground that the selection procedure was faulty. He filed a case against the akademi on September 22, 2002, seeking the high court?s intervention in the matter. 

 Mishra had argued that the books did not comply with the prescribed guidelines of the Sahitya Akademi.

 The petitioner argued that Mu Rigoberta Menchu by Behera was not a translation of any Indian author?s original work. The book was translated to Oriya from the English translation of I...Rigoberta Menchu, the autobiography of Guatemalan Nobel laureate Rigoberta Menchu written in Spanish, he had alleged. 

 Similarly, he contended that Sarthak Sarathi written by Bhuyan was not a proper biography of the former chief minister but was a mere compilation of political speeches of the senior Congress leader

 The petitioner further alleged that Sramana Ra Pruthibi by Naik was heavily borrowed from Therigatha, a compendium of 250 poems penned by nuns who were Lord Buddha?s direct disciples. The poems, written in the Pali script, spoke about their experiences in daily life and the reasons why they renounced the world. 

 The court had served showcause notices on the director and secretary of the state culture department and president of the Sahitya Akademi. After they submitted their answers, the court listened to both the parties and rejected the awards.

 The ruling has placed the selection process under the scanner once again. For long, the literary community has complained of favouritism in the process.

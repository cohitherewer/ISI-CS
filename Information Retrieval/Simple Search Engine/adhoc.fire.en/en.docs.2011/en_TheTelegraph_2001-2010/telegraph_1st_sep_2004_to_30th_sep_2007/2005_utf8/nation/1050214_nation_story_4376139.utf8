 BJP ire at ?desperate? ad 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 13: After posters and CDs on the Godhra episode, it is the turn of a pro-Rashtriya Janata Dal newspaper advertisement to earn the wrath of the BJP.

 Describing it as ?fatwa politics?, BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain today took serious objection to a front-page advertisement in a Hindi daily, which appealed to a minority community to ?stand by Laloo Prasad Yadav in the elections and defeat communal and fascist forces?.

 The advertisement was issued on behalf of Sayyad Ahmad Khan, president of the All-Bihar Ulema Council. 

 ?Laloo Prasad has become so desperate for Muslim votes that he has to import ?cosmetic? leaders. Never before has he taken such a step,? Hussain said at a news conference here this evening.

 The BJP leader alleged that the council was a ?fictitious? one and wondered how it managed to get the money for a front-page advertisement in a daily.

 ?Laloo Prasad is engaging in fatwa politics to garner Muslim votes. It is a violation of the model code and I?ll complain to the Election Commission about this,? Hussain said.

 The BJP leader, who earlier campaigned in the Kosi and Mithila belts, said he was confident of a ?clean sweep? in the second phase. ?The huge turnout of Muslims in our meetings showed that the community is disillusioned with Laloo Prasad, who has never given them a share of power,? he said.

 On the role of the Lok Janshakti Party, Hussain said, ?Ram Vilas Paswan?s LJP cannot provide an answer to the RJD misrule. Besides, Paswan is indirectly supporting Laloo Prasad and will eventually join hands with him.?

 While leaders of several Muslim organisations have asked voters in the community to support Laloo Prasad, chinks in the famed Muslim-Yadav combination of the RJD have given the party chief enough food for thought ahead of the remaining two phases on February 15 and 23.

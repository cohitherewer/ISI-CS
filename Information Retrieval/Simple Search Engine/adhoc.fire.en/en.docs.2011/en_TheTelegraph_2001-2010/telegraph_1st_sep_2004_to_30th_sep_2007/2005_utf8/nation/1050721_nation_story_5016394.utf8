 Ayodhya witness relative vanishes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 20: The mysterious disappearance of a key witnesss brother has opened up a new angle in the investigation of the Ayodhya terrorist strike.

 Ehsaan Khan has been missing since July 5, the day his taxi driver brother Rehan drove the militants to the attack site. The terrorists had apparently forced Rehan out and blown up the jeep at the fencing of the Ram Janmabhoomi complex before launching the strike.

 Rehan is still in custody and is being questioned, but the police are hunting for Ehsaan, who worked as a junior engineer at ERA Ltd, a steel-making unit in Hardwar.

 Factory officials have told the police that Ehsaan had gone on three days casual leave from July 5 but hadnt returned. 

 The senior superintendent of police, Hardwar, Abhinav Kumar, said the brothers are from Kanpur district. We have sent officers to trace Ehsaan, he said.

 The police are trying to gather more information on the disappearance of Ehsaan, said principal secretary, home, Aloke Sinha.

 Another live grenade was found today at the Ayodhya complex, about 30 metres from the sanctum sanctorum.

 The labourers cutting grass in the yellow area had spotted a snake and while chasing it, had stumbled on the grenade.

 The principal secretary, home, said this was the fifth grenade recovered from the 80-acre yellow area in the past 48 hours.

 Like the previous ones, this grenade had had its safety pin pulled out but failed to go off because of some mechanical defects. The anti-bomb squad defused it.

 Security personnel have been ordered to scan the undergrowth in the complex thoroughly in case more grenades are lying there.

 The alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba members arrested from Mendhar, Poonch, on the charge of assisting the Ayodhya attackers were questioned by a team of special task force officers from Uttar Pradesh today. The accused may be produced in Faizabad court soon.

 We have some fresh leads and we hope to unearth the rest of the accused who had provided logistical support to the militants, the principal secretary, home, said.

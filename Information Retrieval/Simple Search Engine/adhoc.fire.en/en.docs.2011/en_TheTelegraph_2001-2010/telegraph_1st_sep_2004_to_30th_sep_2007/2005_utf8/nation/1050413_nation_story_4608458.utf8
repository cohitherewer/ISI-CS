 FDI for radio

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: Information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy stuck to the previous NDA government?s stand not to allow news and current affairs programmes on private FM radio channels, but allowed foreign direct investment in the sector today.

 The minister has been a votary of radio, which he thinks could bring in a social revolution by imparting knowledge and information to rural India. So, there was optimism that the UPA government would allow airing of current affairs programmes on FM channels. 

 Intelligence agencies had shot down the plan during the previous regime, fearing that terrorist and fundamentalist elements could use the channels to air their views.

 Reddy said his ministry had given its nod for 20 per cent FDI in the private FM radio sector. ?We have formalised the policy package for the private FM radio and sent it to various ministries for taking their views, before taking it to the cabinet,? Reddy said. 

 Foreign institutional investment up to 20 per cent of the equity capital was allowed in private FM radio, but not FDI.

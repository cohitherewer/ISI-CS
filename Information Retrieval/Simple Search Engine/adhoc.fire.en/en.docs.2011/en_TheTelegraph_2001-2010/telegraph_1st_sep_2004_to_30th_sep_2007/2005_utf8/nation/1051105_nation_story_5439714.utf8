 Meet to fix EPF rate on Nov 10

 New Delhi, Nov. 4 (PTI): The Central Board of Trustees will meet on November 10 to decide this financial years interest rate on the employees provident fund for its more than 4-crore subscribers.

 In September, the finance and investment sub-committee of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation had recommended an 8 per cent rate for this financial year (compared with 9.5 per cent the previous year).

 But the representatives of the unions on the board of trustees had failed to reach a consensus. While Citu said the interest rate should be at least 9.5 per cent, Intuc demanded that it be on a par with the returns on the fund.

 Hind Mazdoor Sabha secretary A.D. Nagpal said a certain minimum rate should be fixed after discussions.

 Former Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh president Hasubhai Dave said his organisation had not taken any decision on the EPF rate. But he suggested that labour minister K. Chandrasekhara Rao ? who is ex-officio chairman of the meeting ? would favour the 8 per cent rate suggested by the sub-committee.

 A Sangh representative, however, had told the sub-committee that a 12 per cent rate could easily be set, Dave said. We may demand a 12 per cent rate of interest even if it has to be subsidised.

 Citu secretariat member W.R. Varadarajan said his organisation would demand at least a 9.5 per cent rate. He claimed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had promised not to reduce the rate from 9.5 per cent and we take the assurance for the entire term of the UPA government.

 He said the Centre should raise the administered rate of interest on special deposit schemes ? where most of the EPF is parked ? from the current 8 per cent instead of taking the help of reserve funds.

 The 9.5 per cent EPF rate declared for the last financial year had resulted in a deficit of Rs 716 crore, which was met through the reserve fund that now has a corpus of Rs 250 crore, sources said.

 The board meeting was scheduled for July 30 but the ministry had been putting it off. The meeting will also discuss the finance ministrys suggestions to change the pattern of EPF investment.

 Nepal weapon woe for Delhi

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, July 12: Indias supply of non-lethal military equipment to Nepal that reached the Himalayan kingdom over the weekend meets only a fraction of the demand placed by the Royal Nepal Army to the Indian Army under an arms assistance pact. 

 Army headquarters here is urging an early resumption of lethal supplies of ammunition in Indias own security interests.

 The RNA has asked India for an immediate supply of 72 lakh rounds of ammunition for its Indian-manufactured Insas 5.56 and outdated 7.62 combat rifles.

 The RNAs infantry arsenal comprises about 24,000 Indian-supplied rifles and about 23,000 American M-16s apart from about 6,000 Belgian and 6,500 British assault weapons. The RNA has now told India that despite the assistance pact, Nepal will be forced to look for ammunition for even the Indian-supplied weapons from third countries.

 The RNAs projections have bolstered the standpoint of the Indian Army within the security establishment. India signed a 10-year military assistance programme with Nepal about four years ago.

 The debate within the security establishment is reflected in the public statements of government spokespersons and in the physical acts of support or opposition to forces in Nepal. 

 The most repeated of these statements is the noncommittal observation that Indias arms supplies to Nepal are under constant review. 

 Delhi has been nudging not only the palace but also the parliamentary parties and even the Maoists towards talks. Despite its official condemnation of the Maoist insurgency, government agencies are understood to have winked at the visits of leaders of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) to New Delhi.

 Last weekend, Delhi supplied non-lethal weaponry even as a book (Monarchy versus Democracy: The Epic Fight in Nepal) by Baburam Bhattarai, the Maoist leader banned in Nepal and technically wanted in India, was released at a function here.

 The Indian Army is pointing out that there is a huge disconnect among different agencies in Delhi on the understanding of the situation. 

 Senior army sources today said the analysis fed to New Delhi from Kathmandu by intelligence bodies such as the Research and Analysis Wing were widely at variance with the military assessment of conditions in the countryside outside Kathmandu.

 The Indian Army is the chief international patron of the RNA. But their traditional ties are at risk since the coup by King Gyanendra. 

 Not only has the government asked army chief General J.J. Singh, not to respond to the RNAs invitation to take over as its honorary chief, it has also chosen to give a wide berth to a request from the defence secretary of Nepal for a visit to New Delhi. 

 The defence secretary in Nepal is one of the direct links to Narayanhiti palace. The kingdom does not have a defence minister. The portfolio is held by Gyanendra, the supreme commander of its army.

 Its unique relationship with Nepal affords India multiple sources of information from the kingdom. There are 40,000 Nepalese gorkha soldiers in the Indian Army and hundreds of thousands of ex-servicemen pensioned from the army.

 Student sucked into manhole

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Aug. 9: A schoolboy was sucked into an open manhole this afternoon as he waded home through a waterlogged street in the citys gleaming information technology hub.

 Police said the boy was trying to cross a road already under knee-deep water after a short spell of rain. While wading through water he suddenly vanished from sight. Search operations did not yield his body, which appears to have been sucked into an open manhole, said a police officer.

 Last month, a bank officer, who was riding pillion on a scooter, died after she slipped and fell into an open manhole in the Andhra Pradesh capital. Her body was traced five kilometres away.

 This weeks rains have already claimed several lives. Two farmers drowned in Nalgonda district yesterday while a couple of picnickers, including a 16-year-old girl, were swept away by the surging waters of the Nagar- junasagar reservoir the day before.

 Over 22,000 people in 50 villages have lost their homes in three districts in the Krishna basin. Since the inflow is still heavy in the river, it is advisable that residents live in relief camps in uplands for a minimum of six days, said Shashank Goel, the commissioner for disaster management.

 DNA test after Valley protest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, March 4: The Pulwama district magistrate has ordered DNA tests to establish the identity of two persons killed by security forces last month.

 The army claims the two, killed by the 17 J amp;K Light Infantry Regiment at Sharatpura, were ?hardcore terrorists?.

 Nearly 5,000 protestors, who claimed the two killed were innocent civilians, set ablaze the office of the subdivisional magistrate and fought pitched battles with police at Shopian. A youth who was among 14 injured in the clashes succumbed to injuries in hospital, official sources said.

 The district magistrate then ordered exhumation and DNA testing at the Hyderabad forensic lab.

 Villagers told the magistrate that Mukhtar Ahmad Bhat, a baker, and Muhammad Rafiq Ganai, a carpenter, were innocent civilians who were arrested outside the Machuwa camp of the army near Kulgam in south Kashmir on February 16.

 They said they looked for the two in all nearby army camps but everybody denied knowledge of their arrest.

 On February 26, the army said two militants were killed in a gunbattle. The relatives of the two then visited Shopian police station, where they identified them from photographs. The bodies were exhumed yesterday and later handed over to their relatives.

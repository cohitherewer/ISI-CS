 War on Russian chill

 Moscow, Nov. 15: When defence minister Pranab Mukherjee walked out of Sheremetyovo Airports terminal-two here early this morning, suitably clothed in a Russian greatcoat and fur cap, it was with the words: Now Im prepared to declare war on the Moscow winter. 

 A rising chill from Russia in the wake of perceived Indian tilts westwards has meant Mukherjee has an agenda that is short and simple: reassure Moscow that Delhi has sent him here with traditional Indian warmth and, second, that Russia needs India as much as it is the other way round. 

 At his first public encounter with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Ivanov (who is also now the deputy Prime Minister), Mukherjee swiftly cut through the formalities. India, he said, has an extra-special relationship with Moscow. Alongside, it was also paying Russias flagging military-industrial complex a whopping $9 billion (nearly Rs 45,000 crore) to execute Indian contracts. 

 Mukherjee and Ivanov had a one-to-one session that went beyond the scheduled time for the fifth meeting of the inter-governmental commission on military technical cooperation. I am very optimistic that India-Russia defence ties will be truly reflective of our strategic partnership, Mukherjee said. 

 In reality, that is an understatement to describe relations with a country that supplies more than 70 per cent of Indias military hardware. But the defence minister is likely to be more effusive after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow. He is emphasising that his visit here precedes that of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh slated for next month. 

 Ivanov, who visited Delhi for the largest India-Russia army exercise just last month, has been more vocal on what Russia expects of India to show this special relationship. He has been absolutely insistent that India sign an intellectual property rights agreement governing all defence supplies to guarantee secrecy. The issue is likely to be addressed substantially in the three days of talks here but the ceremonial signing would be reserved for Singhs visit. 

 The talks in Moscow between the two defence ministers are taking place even as Indian and US fighter aircraft are engaged in mock drills in Bengal skies. Mukherjee also returns to Delhi on a day the Indian army has invited defence attaches of nearly all diplomatic missions based in the Indian capital to a firepower demonstration in the Rajasthan Desert. 

 Indias military-diplomatic engagement with big powers is being developed in a new policy thrust from South Block. That is the current context of Indias traditional strategic partnership with Russia. 

 Apart from addressing successfully the IPR issue, the delegations here are expected to resolve some outstanding issues. Among these is a long pending Indian request to fast track supplies of spares for the IAFs aircraft ? MiG 29s, Sukhoi 30s, MiG 23s, Mi-8 helicopters and AN-32 transporters.

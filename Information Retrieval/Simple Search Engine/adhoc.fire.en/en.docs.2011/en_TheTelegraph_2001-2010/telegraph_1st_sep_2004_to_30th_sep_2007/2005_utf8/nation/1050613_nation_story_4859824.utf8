 Bookie spills more

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai/Ahmedabad, June 12: Top international cricket bookie Shobhan Mehta has made more disclosures during his interrogation, Ahmedabad police claimed today. But they refused to give details.

 He is still in Ahmedabad. We have been interrogating him, additional commissioner (crime) D.G. Vanzara said.

 Yesterday, the Mumbai-based bookie, whose business spanned across India, Pakistan, England and Australia, had described to the police how Mohammed Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja and Nayan Mongia offered him tips on factors that decided the fate of games. The Indian cricketers have denied the claims.

 Mehta also named Australian Mark Waugh and the late South African captain Hansie Cronje, the police said yesterday.

 The crime branch had sought a five-day remand of the bookie yesterday but the court refused to grant it. Vanzara, however, said: It (the denial of remand) is not a setback for the crime branch. We can still continue to interrogate him.

 The bookie has been granted bail by a metropolitan court in Ahmedabad but it directed him to report every day to the crime branch till the investigation is completed.

 An investigating officer of the Mumbai crime branch, Aslam Momin, said: Mehta is already on bail in our case. There is no question of re-arresting him for the moment.

 Mehta was arrested by Ahmedabad police from a Mumbai hospital.

 The bookie, who was arrested under the gambling act, is also suspected of having links with dons like Chhota Shakeel, Amar Naik and Arun Gawli, who placed huge bets through him.

 Yesterday, a Mumbai police team also raided the house of Arjun Nihalchandani, a Rajkot-based bookie said to be Mehtas point man in Gujarat. A mobile phone was found in his house that the police hope would give them more information about Nihalchandanis betting transactions and his clients. He is also believed to have a laptop that the police expect to be of help.

 Nihalchandani is in the custody of Mumbai police. He will be taken into custody of the Ahmedabad police tomorrow, Vanzara said. His interrogation, the police feel, could lead to major breakthroughs in the betting network spread over other towns in Gujarat.

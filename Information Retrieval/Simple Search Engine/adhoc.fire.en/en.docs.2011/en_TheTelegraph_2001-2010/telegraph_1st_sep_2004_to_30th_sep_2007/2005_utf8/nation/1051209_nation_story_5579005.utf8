The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Power tariff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 8: Bengal has opposed the draft national policy on power tariff amid signals it would ask the state regulator to toss out the proposals.

 The state is unhappy with the way cross-subsidy ? which requires industrial units to pay more so that households can be charged less ? is dealt within the policy. 

 It is also uncomfortable with a couple of other aspects of the policy that it believes will discourage fresh investment.

 The draft policy provides for elimination of cross-subsidy in one go. The method of computing is such that low-end consumers will bear the burden even as high-end users pay less. This is not in conformity with the Electricity Act 2003, state power minister Mrinal Banerjee said.

 He added that the formula agreed to earlier envisaged gradual elimination of subsidies. The minister said he had spoken to Union power minister P.M. Sayeed.

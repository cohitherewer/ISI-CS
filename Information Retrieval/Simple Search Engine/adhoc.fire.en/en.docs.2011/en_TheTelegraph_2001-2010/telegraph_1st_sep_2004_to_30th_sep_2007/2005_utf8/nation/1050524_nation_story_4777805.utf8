 Old foes wounds still fester

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 New Delhi, May 23: The dissolution of the Bihar Assembly seems to have had little impact on the two warring leaders who have been promising to teach each other a lesson.

 Laloo Prasad Yadav was in a belligerent mood last night at Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs dinner. As he was negotiating a tiger prawn, a ministerial colleague jokingly asked why he had sounded conciliatory towards Ram Vilas Paswan earlier in the day.

 The RJD boss replied his idea of happiness was to tire out his enemies. Main unhe bhigo bhigo kar marta hoon (I dip them and dip them again before taking them on), he said, quickly adding his words should not be taken seriously.

 A Union minister from Bihar said bringing Laloo Prasad and Lok Janshakti Party chief Paswan together would be the toughest task before the UPA leadership.

 All through yesterday, while governor Buta Singh was busy sending reports to Union home minister Shivraj Patil and Paswan frantic SoS messages to the Congress and Left leadership, Laloo Prasad remained unresponsive.

 When a Congress leader asked him to consider Paswans proposal, he answered coldly: Who is he to determine who should be the leader of the RJD? His game is up and he should realise it. Do we ever ask who should be the LJP leader?

 Sunday evening also saw Sharad Pawars pivotal role in speeding up the Assembly dissolution. Pawar, often informally called the UPA convener, is believed to have strongly advocated it and prevailed on Patil to act fast.

 Those familiar with Maharashtra politics would vouch that Pawars words matter to Patil, although he had two reports from governor Buta Singh and a green signal from significant UPA leaders.

 By 6 pm yesterday, the mood was that dissolution was the only option. But Paswan was not in the know. Around 7.30 pm, he asked Pawar if Laloo Prasad would be okay with Jabir Hussain, chairman of the Bihar legislative council, as chief minister. The crafty Pawar kept mum.

 Even today, the bad blood between Laloo Prasad and Paswan showed. The LJP chief said the rigid stand of Laloo Prasad in not having a Muslim chief minister had led to the dissolution. It was because of the rigid stand of Laloo Prasad that none other than Rabri Devi will be the chief minister that the House had to be dissolved, he said.

 Although he did not welcome the dissolution, Paswan was of the view that Buta Singh had no other option. Ridiculing Laloo Prasads remark that he was adamant, he said: I was agreeable to any Muslim candidate from any party but Laloo Prasad insisted on his wife. I had even agreed to someone from the RJD. Now who is rigid is for anybody to guess.

 Paswan alleged that the Bihar House was dissolved as Laloo Prasad was not comfortable out of power just like a fish out of water. The NDA added fuel to the fire by indulging in horse-trading and targeting my MLAs, he said.

 The RJD chief hoped for a political realignment in the ensuing polls but it looks unlikely in spite of efforts by the Congress and the Left parties.

 Without naming Paswan, Laloo Prasad said the people of Bihar would punish those responsible for imposition of Presidents rule and dissolution of the Assembly.

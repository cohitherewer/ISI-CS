 UK to consult India on Nepal

 Reid: Identifying troubles

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: The UK will consult India before re-considering its decision to supply weapons to Nepal, British secretary for defence John Reid said here today after talks with defence minister Pranab Mukherjee.

 We have suspended sale of lethal equipment to Nepal. That suspension stands. We do not think the situation has changed yet to review the policy. When the time comes, we will take India in mind on it, Reid said at a news conference this evening.

 The UK, the US and India decided to suspend supplies of arms and ammunition to Nepals army after the February 1 takeover by King Gyanendra. Nepal figured largely in Reids discussions with Mukherjee today.

 In their talks, Reid and Mukherjee shared views on Indias South Asian neighbourhood. Reid was in Delhi after a trip to Islamabad.

 Reid identified Chinas issue with Taiwan, North Korea and the India-Pakistan contest over Kashmir as the three major disputes involving nuclear powers that ran the risk of conflict. But he conveyed the UKs appreciation of the Indo-Pak engagement and confidence-building measures and urged both to persist with talks.

 As our experience in Northern Ireland has shown, these processes are like riding a bicycle. As long as all of us are on the bicycle and it is moving, its fine; but if it stops, then we fall and the bad guys move in, Reid said.

 In his talks with Mukherjee, Reid informed the defence minister that a British deputy chief of defence staff, who was with him in the delegation, will be back in New Delhi to chart a series of bilateral military exercises beginning with a drill involving aircraft carrier groups.

 Reid said that during his Pakistan tour, he had raised the issue of combating fundamentalists across borders. He said he had told Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz that it was important to support UN conventions on terrorism. 

 He referred specifically to a Taliban leader in Pakistan who was tom-tomming the killing of a British soldier as an achievement. Reid said he was told that the Taliban leader had been put behind bars.

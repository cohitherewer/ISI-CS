 Rival sniffs RJD ploy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: The BJP has alleged a ?quid pro quo? between rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and L.V. Saptharishi over the controversial disclosures on last Mays Chhapra elections.

 Singh, a senior member of Laloo Prasad Yadavs RJD, allegedly tried to ensure a three-year tenure for Saptharishi as director-general of the Council for Advancement of Peoples Action and Rural Technology, which is under his ministry.

 The Bengal cadre IAS official who has questioned the integrity of election commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswamy in ordering the Chhapra repoll has a few months to go before retirement. If things worked to plan, he would have got another two-and-a-half years in the hot seat, the BJP claimed.

 Singh denied the charge saying there was nothing in any file to secure an extension for Saptharishi. He said he would ?make public? the proceedings of Capart from April 30 to May 6 to counter the charge that he had started the process to ensure an ?extension? for the official.

 The minister said the ?substantive? issue was the report Saptharishi had given the Election Commission on the Chhapra election of which he was an observer. ?He was sent in that capacity when he was serving as an official under Jaitley (in the commerce ministry).

 ?It was Jaitley who, in his annual confidential report, described the official as not just very good but outstanding. I challenge him to state whose man Saptharishi is ? mine or his,? Singh said.

 The BJP used the Saptharishi controversy to serve a ?chargesheet? on the Manmohan Singh government for the alleged ?disparagement of various institutions, including constitutional authorities?.

 In a press briefing, BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said: ?Initially, it could have been treated as an isolated event but now there appears to be a systematic pattern.?

 On the face-off between the poll panel and Laloo Prasad, Jaitley said it was ?unusual? for a minister to demand the resignation of constitutional authorities and that too ?at the behest of a dubious claim of a civil servant?.

 ?To add to the credibility of this dubious claim, annual confidential reports of this officer were leaked by the government to the media.... This could not have happened without the active connivance of the other departments of the government which were dealing with these ACRs,? Jaitley charged.

 He then took off on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying he was not a ?silent spectator to this attack on the institutions? but that his government was an ?active participant in perpetuating this?.

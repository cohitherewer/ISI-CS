 Rebel war plan plea

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: CRPF director-general J.K. Sinha today called for a national policy to fight Naxalites, terming the Chhattisgarh attack that killed 25 of his colleagues the worst ever suffered by the force.

 Pointing out that different policies followed by different states were complicating the ground situation, he said a national policy was the need of the hour as central police forces were involved in operations against Naxalites and other insurgents.

 Blaming the death of the 25 men on complacency, he said his team would be making tactical and strategic changes to deal with the war-like situation in Naxalite-affected states. He said the rebels desperation to prove they had not been cornered yet had come through in the attack.

 Despite losing his personnel, Sinha pitched for the mine-proof vehicles ? one had been blasted by the rebels ? manufactured by the Medak ordnance factory in Andhra Pradesh. 

 Similar vehicles are being produced in South Africa which our army is using very effectively. This MPV is as good as that, if not better, and a very good indigenous effort.

 Despite being hit by the most powerful blast that our security forces have witnessed till now, the shell of the MPV was intact though its differential and wheels got detached.

 The CRPF has claimed that a post-mortem of the bodies showed that the personnel in the mine-proof vehicle died of spinal and head injuries.

 Their bodies suffered two blows, one when the MPV got blown up by the powerful IED blasts and the second when the vehicle came down with a thud after hitting a height of 35 feet, Sinha said. 

 But the MPV would still qualify as a successful vehicle and needs certain adjustments like shock observers and cushioning to ward off high-intensity impact.

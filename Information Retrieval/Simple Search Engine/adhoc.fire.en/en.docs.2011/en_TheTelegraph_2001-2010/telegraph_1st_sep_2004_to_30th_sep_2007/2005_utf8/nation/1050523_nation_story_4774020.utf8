 Jaya fights LTTE slur

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, May 22: Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa has written to the Centre debunking parts of a Union home ministry report that suggests the LTTE still uses her state as a base to smuggle petrol, diesel and drugs to Sri Lanka.

 In her letter to home minister Shivraj Patil, she highlights her past record in battling the rebel outfit.

 In particular, she plays up a recent communication to her from the same ministry conveying a specific personal threat to me from the LTTE, by assigning a mission to a woman suicide bomber.

 At a time when the Tamil Tigers are targeting her, I find it most distressing that an impression is sought to be created that the activities of the LTTE are being facilitated from Tamil Nadu, the letter says.

 This (allegation in the report) clearly appears to be a carefully orchestrated plan merely to besmirch the unique track record of my government in its bold and uncompromising stand against the LTTE, Jayalalithaa said. 

 It is common knowledge that my government, in the period 1991-96, saw to it that against great odds and personal risk to me, the LTTE could not retain even a toehold in Tamil Nadu. I have always been credited for my clear and uncompromising stand against the LTTE.

 The letter goes on to make the following points:

 Jayalalithaa spearheaded 

 the move to ban the LTTE in early 1992 after former Prime 

 Minister Rajiv Gandhis assassination in May 1991.

 In 2002, the Tamil Nadu 

 Assembly passed a resolution moved by her that the Centre 

 should make legal and diplomatic efforts to get LTTE chief 

 Prabhakaran extradited to India and tried for the murder 

 of Rajiv Gandhi.

 When the UPA government 

 decided to repeal the terror act, I had taken up the 

 issue repeatedly with the Prime Minister suggesting that 

 the move should be dropped, particularly as it would affect 

 my governments relentless efforts to curtail the activities 

 of the LTTE and other terrorist groups aligned with the 

 LTTE.

 When the proposal for a 

 land bridge between Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu came up, I 

 stoutly protested against this and had it stopped in view 

 of the security considerations involving the LTTE.

 The letter draws Patils attention to the growing air capability of the LTTE, which has reportedly built airstrips and bought medium-sized aircraft. This has major security implications for India and the home ministry should take serious note of this.

 Bank gets goonda rap, bill for damages

 New Delhi, Oct. 13 (PTI): ICICI Bank has been pulled up for goondaism and told to pay Rs 20,000 as compensation after it seized a two-wheeler from a customer who defaulted on a payment of Rs 1,889. It was also asked to refund the amount the customer had already paid towards the vehicle loan.

 Dheeraj Jain had got his scooter financed by ICICI Bank. On February 12 this year, he got a notice from the bank giving him seven days time to pay an outstanding amount of Rs 1,889.

 Two days later, Jain was stopped while travelling on his scooter by four persons near Mori Gate Bus Terminus and told to hand over the vehicle as he had failed to make the payment on time. They pointed a pistol at him when he tried to resist, forcing him to give in to their demand. The bank later sold the vehicle.

 The fact leaves us aghast at the manner of functioning and goondaism in which the bank is involved for a petty amount of Rs 1,889... Such attitude is deplorable and sends a chill down the spine, consumer disputes redressal forum (north) president K.K. Chopra and members N. Mittal and S.C. Jain said.

 The bank argued it had taken peaceful possession of the vehicle after due intimation to the complainant as he was irregular in remitting monthly instalments. But the court found out that the records proved otherwise.

 The bank had the option to recover dues through legal means. They have no legal right to snatch the vehicle in such a manner which amounts to robbery, the court said. As the vehicle was sold, the forum directed the bank to refund Rs 32,205 paid till then by the complainant, besides ordering a compensation of Rs 20,000 and Rs 1,000 as cost of litigation.

 Father, brother in rape glare

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, April 22: Still reeling under the shock of a 14-year-old?s rape by her father, the city has another teenager?s repeated rape by her father to contend with.

 In 16-year-old Reshma Bi?s torture, her 55-year-old father, Ajaz Ali, was joined by her brother Afroz, 21.

 Inspector Riasat Ali Khan said her mother Safia Begum filed a complaint yesterday accusing the two of making her second daughter pregnant.

 The girl, about four months from delivering her father?s child, told police: ?They warned me that I would meet the same fate as my elder sister Afisa, who hanged herself out of shame.?

 An 18-year-old pregnant Afisa had committed suicide around four years ago after being raped by her father.

 After months of silence, Reshma (not her real name) had approached her grandmother, Rahmat Bi, and recounted her torment.

 Ajaz had largely been staying home at Kanchanbagh since abandoning fruit vending about eight months ago. Reshma had dropped out of school after matriculation. 

 The police said the father-son duo was taken into custody and is being interrogated.

 It was shocking enough for Safia to learn that her husband of 38 years was capable of raping his daughter, but Reshma?s revelation about Afisa, too, being his victim has made matters worse.

 The city?s warts of incest came under public glare 12 days ago when 14-year-old Noorjehan?s mother lodged a complaint against her husband, accusing him of raping his daughter.

 Mohammed Saleem Khan, whose child Noorjehan (also not her real name) was carrying, had threatened to kill her if she said anything to her mother. He was picked up about a fortnight ago.

 Through consensus among social activists, legal counsel and doctors, Noorjehan?s pregnancy was successfully terminated even at an advanced stage.

 ?The society, the police and the law-makers have to take stock of the situation and try to tackle situations like this,? said Manjula, a gynaecologist at a government hospital and activist against gender inequality.

 Social scientists linked the crimes to poverty and illiteracy. ?In both cases ? Noorjehan and Reshma?s ?literacy levels were very low and living conditions below normal,? said Pratap Reddy, a social activist.

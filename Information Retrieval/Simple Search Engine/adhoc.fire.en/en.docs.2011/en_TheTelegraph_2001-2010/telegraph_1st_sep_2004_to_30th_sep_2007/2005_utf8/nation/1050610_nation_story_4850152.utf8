 Atal plots Advani escape

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, June 9: Hemmed in from all sides, L.K. Advani is pinning his hopes on the escape artist.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee is at work with his team, behind-the-scenes, trying to muster support for his old adversary.

 From riots to rath yatras, mosque demolitions to cricket tours, the BJPs Big Two had found themselves at variance, if not on opposite sides. During the events seen as Advanis greatest triumphs, Vajpayee had stayed away.

 One of these was the Ram rath yatra of 1990, in which the former Prime Minister was supposed to have a role.

 The yatra, as planned by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs Morapant Pingle and former BJP ideologue K.N. Govindacharya, was to start from four extremities of the country and converge in Ayodhya.

 Advani would have been on one of the four chariots; the other three were to be manned by Vajpayee, Vijayaraje Scindia and Sikandar Bakht.

 Scindia excused herself citing poor health and Bakht said he couldnt withstand the travails of such a long journey. As for Vajpayee, he went abroad as part of a parliamentary delegation, leaving Advani as Rams lone sarathi (charioteer).

 When the Babri demolition happened, Vajpayee was again out of the country. 

 The stigma of both these events stuck to Advani and crystallised his image as a hardliner. So much so that when it was time for the BJP to take a shot at power at the Centre by leading a coalition, he was counselled by the Sangh to make way for the liberal Vajpayee.

 Vajpayee had his image and Jaswant Singh and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat for company. Advani had the party, the Sangh and its affiliates. Neither leader could ignore the other.

 Now when Advani is under siege from the Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad ? and has been ditched by his boys Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar ? its to Vajpayee and his men that he has turned for succour.

 Vajpayee has already got Brajesh Mishra, his former principal secretary for whom Advani harbours no love, to try and bail him out.

 Mishra has been using his clout with the opinion-makers to put Advanis Pakistan visit and his statements there in the right perspective. He has argued that once Advani is on board, the Manmohan Singh governments peace moves would get the strength they need. 

 If Vajpayee, Mishra, Jaswant Singh and Shekhawat have come to Advanis aid, sources said its for two reasons. 

 One, the quartet has long been at odds with the Sangh. Two, the leaders want to ensure that the BJP retains some continuity in its policies.

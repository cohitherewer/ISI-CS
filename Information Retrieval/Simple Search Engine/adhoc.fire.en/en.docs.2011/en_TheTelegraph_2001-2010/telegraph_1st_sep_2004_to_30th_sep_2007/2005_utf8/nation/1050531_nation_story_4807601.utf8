 Buddha push for council to end rat race

 Buddhadeb: Nagging issues

 Ranchi, May 30: A special council alone could prevent eastern states from competing with each other, said Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee before boarding the Shatabdi Express to Howrah in the afternoon. 

 Such a council, he added, should include Chhattisgarh as well. Officials from different states, he said, will meet shortly to give it a more concrete shape.

 The council, Bhattacharjee added, could take steps to attract investment to states in eastern India and promote industry without any conflict of interest. There have been recent instances, he said, of one state trying to deprive others and emerge as sole beneficiary.

 In a veiled reference to Jharkhand and Orissa insisting that industrialists desirous of mining iron ore should set up industries at the same time, he said while one state might enjoy one advantage, other states might have other advantages.

 Bhattacharjee refused to comment on the controversy surrounding the Jindal groups plans to set up a steel plant in Bengal but get the iron ore from Jharkhand. 

 I am here to meet my friend Arjun Munda and I will not speak on a controversial issue. But both states must work in coordination, he said.

 The chief minister, who was accompanied by Bengals chief secretary and home secretary, had driven in last evening from Purulia and was the first to leave the meeting of the eastern zonal council around 12.45 pm today.

 The eastern zonal council met here after nearly 14 years. The meeting appeared to last just about two-and-a-half hours before Bhattacharjee, Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik and Sikkim chief minister Pawan Chamling left.

 While the hosts made no arrangement for any briefing, officials associated with the chief ministers secretariat claimed that the state had forcefully raised contenti- ous issues like the discord over the Massanjore dam and settlement of 48 mouzas of Malda district adjoining Sahebganj.

 Officials pointed out that the entire 9,430-hectare submergence area of Massanjore dam falls in Dumka district of Jharkhand whereas 90 per cent of the irrigation command area falls in Bengal. 

 While Bengal wants the water level at the dam to be maintained at 398 metres so as to have adequate water for irrigation, Jharkhand wants it to be at 386 metres fearing submergence at Dumka. 

 Jharkhand also wants more water from the dam for irrigation. But it is the alleged submergence of forest area that remains at the heart of the dispute. The gates are operated by the Bengal government. Jharkhand has suggested that a joint gate regulation committee be formed to operate the gates.

 On November 14, 2003, due to a rise in the water level in the reservoir, 15 acres of forest land went under four feet of water. Notices were served to the Damodar Valley Corporation by the state government but no one turned up.

 The state government filed a case before Dhanbads chief judicial magistrate against the DVC. 

 The case is lying before Jharkhand High Court.

 Fuel for energy talks

 Chicago, April 15: President George W. Bush?s signal in receiving an Indian delegation in the Oval Office yesterday yielded an American commitment to pursue cabinet-level dialogue with New Delhi on nuclear power and a joint working group on space.

 India has opted to strike while the iron is hot: the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, is staying back in Washington to pursue discussions on economic matters, nuclear energy and Indo-US scientific cooperation.

 It was announced at a joint news conference by foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice in Washington that defence minister Pranab Mukherjee would shortly visit America to discuss US proposals to sell arms to India and upgrade bilateral defence cooperation.

 The energy talks, which India has been seeking, will be held between Ahluwalia and the Bush administration?s energy secretary Samuel Bodman.

 The foreign minister said at the news conference: ?I am particularly happy to compliment our American friends for the fresh approach they have brought to bear on a subject that is of such vital importance for us.?

 Rice, however, indicated that the dialogue will be a slow and difficult process in view of US non-proliferation laws and cautioned against raising expectations.

 She said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal that the US was not yet ready to sell nuclear reactor technology to India. 

 ?We are not there, that is not the case. We have agreed with the Indians that we can talk about a variety of energy sources but obviously there are NPT (nuclear non-proliferation treaty) implications that are quite serious about civilian nuclear power in India.?

 She made it clear at the news conference that India?s attempts to step up energy cooperation with Iran would be a factor in the Indo-US dialogue.

 ?We have made clear our concerns (to India) about the Iranian development. We have made clear that at a time when Iran has clearly not yet made a strategic choice to demonstrate to the world that it is prepared to live up to its international obligations, that we would hope that this would be taken into account. But these are the kinds of discussions that we continue to have.?

 The foreign minister, however, said the dialogue ?recognises the importance of addressing (India?s) growing energy demands while taking into account their environmental implications?. He said the three main components of the talks would be civil nuclear energy, hydrocarbons and cleaner technologies.

 Singh said ?our cooperation in space highlights the technology bond that is a special characteristic of our ties. Our goal is to promote synergies in all aspects of space collaboration, including satellite fabrication and launch?.

 He said the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership process will be accelerated. ?It has been a useful and productive engagement but we are now looking at even wider horizons.?

 Rice said her recently appointed official in charge of UN reform, Shirin Tahir-Kheli, is to travel to Delhi shortly to discuss issues related to India?s quest for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.

 She said India?s case has to be approached ?in the broader context of UN reform. Yes, we have supported Japan for some very particular reasons... Japan really is the second largest contributor to the UN?.

 China not a rival, says Natwar

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh today made it clear that India does not see China as a rival or wants to ?counter-balance? Beijing?s influence in East Asia by playing a more meaningful role in the region.

 ?There are many who look at India-China relations with the old mindset of ?balance of power? or ?conflict of interests? and see East Asia as a theatre of competition between these two countries,? he said. 

 ?Such theories are losing relevance in today?s dynamics of Asia?s quest for peace and prosperity.?

 The comment was in sharp contrast with the ?potential threat No. 1? label slapped on China by George Fernandes when he was defence minister during the NDA regime. 

 Singh was delivering the inaugural lecture at the seventh Asian Security Conference organised by the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis on Changing Security Dynamics in Eastern Asia.

 The minister?s observations gather significance as they come within days of the first strategic dialogue between India and China held here.

 Moreover, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is due to visit India in March-end. The trip is being seen as a major event that can contribute significantly to the upswing in relations between the two Asian giants.

 However, sceptics both within the region and outside have often raised doubts over growing ties between the two sides that used to be rivals. Singh?s remarks appear to be addressed at both the sceptics as well as the leadership in Beijing.

 The minister pointed out that developments in East Asia were of ?direct consequence? to India?s security and development. ?We are, therefore, actively engaged in creating a bond of friendship and cooperation with East Asia that has a strong economic foundation and a cooperative paradigm of positive inter-connectedness of security interests,? he said.

 Singh pointed out that India and China are engaged in the expansion of the commonalities while pro-actively addressing differences, including the question of boundary.

 ?Despite the differences, our 3,400-km-long border with China has largely remained tranquil over the last 25 years. This is by no means a minor achievement and should be enough to silence those who look at India-China relations only from an adverse prism,? the minister said. ?It is for everyone to see that we have not allowed our differences to hold development in our relations across an impressive range of areas.?

 Singh underlined the ?increasingly greater realisation? that there is enough space and opportunity in the region for both India and China to prosper. ?We are not just passively embedded in our region bound by our common neighbourhood, but are constantly interacting through endeavours which have brought huge dividends to both.?

 He pointed out that trade between the two sides ? worth a few million till some years ago ? has now crossed $13 billion. 

 ?We are mindful of the overarching importance of a peaceful surrounding environment for us to pursue our most fundamental task of national development.?

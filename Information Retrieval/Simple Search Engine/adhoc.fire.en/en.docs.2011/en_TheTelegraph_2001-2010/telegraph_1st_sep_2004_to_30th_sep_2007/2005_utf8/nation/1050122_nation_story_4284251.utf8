 Strain on ceasefire

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: Id to Id, the India-Pakistan ceasefire along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir is in danger of coming undone after three incidents of machine gun firing and mortar shelling in three days, two of them on Thursday night.

 The guns that fell silent on Id-ul-Fitr, November 26, 2003, have spat fire this week in the days leading to Id-ul-Zuha today after 13 months of quiet on the northern front. In the first instance last night, several rounds from a universal machine gun and about 12 rounds of 60 mm mortar were fired at the Indian post at Gambhir in the Rajouri sector. In army parlance, this is categorised as small-arms fire.

 In the second incident, which took place after midnight, an Indian army position at Manjakote in Rajouri district was targeted with a universal machine gun and 60 mm mortars. If the intention of the Pakistani army is to wreck the ceasefire, sources believe, they would have launched a ?fire assault? and opened up with heavy artillery to catch Indian troops by surprise.

 Army sources said Indian troops were under strict instructions to be on a high level of alert but not to retaliate. Retaliation would escalate tensions at a time when the political leadership in New Delhi feels talking peace with Pakistan is more advantageous than returning to the stage of no-peace no-war that ended with the ceasefire that began on Id-ul-Fitr in 2003.

 Despite the repeated firing it has taken, army headquarters in New Delhi is being circumspect. While the vice-chief, Lt Gen. B.S. Thakur, termed the attack on its Durga and Banvat posts on Tuesday night as ?ceasefire violation? by Pakistan, army headquarters is not yet categorising the subsequent incidents as such.

 But the sequence of events is all too familiar. Invariably, Indian and Pakistani troops in the past have opened fire from sectors and posts where each side believes it holds a positive advantage.

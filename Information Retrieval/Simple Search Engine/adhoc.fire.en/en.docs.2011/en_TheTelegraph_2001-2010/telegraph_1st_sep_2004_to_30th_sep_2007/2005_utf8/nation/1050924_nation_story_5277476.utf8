 Japanese student in molest cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 23: A Japanese student today alleged an attempt was made to molest her at the Congress headquarters. 

 Mahiko, a 35-year-old student at Osmania University, has filed a police complaint alleging a Congress worker dragged her into a room at the state party office and tried to molest her.

 The post-graduate student in the Urdu department said she had ventured into Gandhi Bhavan by mistake on her way to a cultural programme in an auditorium behind the Congress office. She asked directions to Prakasham Hall, where the show was being held.

 Someone offered to take me to the hall by a shortcut and while walking in a passage dragged me into a room and tried to rape me, she said.

 Mahiko said that no one in the Congress office supported her when she complained against the offender.

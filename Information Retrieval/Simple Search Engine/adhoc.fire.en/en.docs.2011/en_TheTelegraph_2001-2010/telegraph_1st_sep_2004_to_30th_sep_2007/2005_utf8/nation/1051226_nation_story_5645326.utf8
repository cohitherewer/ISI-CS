 Rows of towering tribute

 Vedaranyam, Dec. 25: It took Pushpavanam just 24 hours to build perhaps the worlds largest monument to the dead: one memorial each for the 1.75 lakh tsunami victims.

 It will be some time before they reach their full grandeur, though, with the saplings shooting high as tall and wispy casuarinas or sprouting into the bushy pandanus. Arranged along the coast like rows of sentinels, saluting the dead and offering a first line of defence against future killer waves.

 The tsunami mega tree plantations project is spread across a 20-hectare area, 12 km from here, at the southern tip of Nagapattinam close to the Palk Strait. It was funded by IT major Wipro and Bitsunami, a trust formed by the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in Pilani, Rajasthan. The Tamil Nadu government helped carry it out.

 The official figure of confirmed deaths in the 14 countries hit by the tsunami is 174,542; but the number of saplings planted is 254,464.

 We had that many extra saplings, explains M. Subramaniam, a retired block development officer from Vedaranyam and chief coordinator for the project. 

 It should be a record: the entire lot was planted in 24 hours by 300 workmen.

 The thick and bushy pandanus plants (also known as screwpine, ketaki or keya) will come up in four rows close to the sea with the casuarinas forming an inner wall of security. Both are salt tolerant and ideal for coastal protection.

 The saplings need to be maintained well for a year after which they will grow rapidly, Subramaniam said.

 Two weeks ago, when tropical storm Fanoos weakened and blew over Vedaranyam, the waves had battered parts of the plantation. So we are replanting those areas to ensure the total number stays constant, Subramaniam said.

Gujarat deletes nuptial nod term

Ahmedabad (PTI): The Gujarat government has 

introduced an amendment to the marriage registration form making parental consent 

optional.

 The clause, which created an uproar, was added in the form as part of an administrative instruction on July 20.

 It said any couple coming for registration would have to get no-objection letters from their parents.

 Inspector-general of registration and marriages H.B. Varia, the main official behind the clause, said it did not intend to offend anybody. The aim is to put a check on bogus marriages that are registered in the state everyday. 

 The clause was misinterpreted, he said, as it only asked the couple for the letter and did not say they have to bring it along when they come here (for registration).

 But now they do not need to produce any such paper. They can do so, only if they really want to, he said.

 The government has removed the clause from the form and deleted it from its website, Varia added.

UP orders hoarding clean-up

Pune (PTI): The CBI on Saturday formally arrested 

Abdul Karim Telgi, the alleged mastermind of the fake stamp paper scam, in connection 

with a case registered at Daryaganj police station in 2001.

 While hearing a writ petition of one Sanjay Gupta, the high court recently ordered their removal and said no hoardings shall be erected on roads or pedestrian pathways unless the government forms statutory rules for their installation with the prior approval of the chief town planner.

 The court also ruled that anyone defacing buildings or boundary walls would be prosecuted or fined.

Blast averted

 Srinagar (PTI): An explosive device wrapped 

in a polythene bag was defused on Saturday in the business hub of the city. 

 The device was detected by a police patrol near the clock tower in Lal Chowk around 12.15 pm.

 CBI plea

New Delhi (PTI): The CBI requested a city court on Saturday 

to reconsider its order asking the agency to get the Supreme Courts sanction 

to close 15 cases against former petroleum minister Satish Sharma. The Congress 

leader had allegedly misused his power in allotting petrol pumps and gas agencies. 

But the Centre did not sanction his prosecution.

Anti-Naxalite raid

Jaunpur (PTI): Four Naxalites were killed and 

60 arrested in the rebel-infested districts of Uttar Pradesh. Police have been 

raiding Chandauli, Mirzapur and Sonebhadra districts, inspector-general, Varanasi, 

Devraj Nagar, said. 

 The second all-India bodywear meet is being held in Chennai from Friday. The three-day event aims to educate retailers on the variety in design, fashion and style in innerwears.

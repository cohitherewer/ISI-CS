 Jaya in army role storm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Feb. 8: Jayalalithaa?s remark on the army?s role in retrieving bodies of tsunami victims in Tamil Nadu is likely to spark another Centre-state row after the DMK resurrected it today.

 The chief minister had told the Assembly last week that the state police had lent a helping hand after the army ?refused? to ?physically remove the bodies? from the debris.

 Her remark had followed the Opposition?s claim in the Assembly that the army did all the relief work. It had been almost forgotten as an avoidable embarrassment till the DMK dug it out today.

 DMK chief M. Karunanidhi said Union defence minister Pranab Mukherjee ?owed an explanation? to the people if Jayalalithaa?s allegation were true.

 He demanded that Mukherjee take action against those responsible for what has been attributed to the army.

 The retrieval of bodies and their cremation or burial would not have been possible, at least in worst-hit Nagapattinam district, if not for the army. It cleared the several damaged boats choking a vital bridge and the approach road from Nagapattinam town to the fishing hamlets. The army had also helped the district administration remove the debris in affected areas.

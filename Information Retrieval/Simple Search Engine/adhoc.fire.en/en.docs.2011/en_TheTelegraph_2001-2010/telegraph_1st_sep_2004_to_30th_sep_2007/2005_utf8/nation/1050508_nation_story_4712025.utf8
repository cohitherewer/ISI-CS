 New Delhi, May 7: India today made the first move to re-establish contacts with Iraq and offered assistance for reconstruction of the war-torn country and cooperation in areas of mutual interest.

 This is the first time that New Delhi has made an offer directly to the Iraqi regime in Baghdad on playing a role in the country.

 The offer was made by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his congratulatory letter to his Iraqi counterpart Ibrahim al Jaafari on the formation of a new transitional government.

 India, which had refused to send troops to Iraq to participate in the American effort to stabilise the country after the Bush administration got rid of the Saddam Hussein regime, had expressed its willingness to work for the reconstruction of the country. But so far, it has been in private conversation. 

 But it is not clear whether India will take the risk of sending its personnel to help in the reconstruction of Iraq till it is absolutely confident of an improvement in the security situation in the country.

 Last year, the abduction of three Indian truck drivers by a militant Iraqi group had given the UPA coalition many sleepless nights. The three drivers were released following diplomatic endeavours by India.

 ?The new government has just been put in place and, therefore, the question of making the offer to Iraq directly does not arise,? a foreign ministry official said when asked to comment on Delhis willingness to work for the reconstruction of the country.

 In his message, the Prime Minister said India would like to further strengthen the bonds of friendship between the two countries and their people. Singh wished the Iraqi people success in their efforts towards building a peaceful, stable and prosperous Iraq.

 ?In keeping with Indias long tradition of close political, economic and cultural ties with Iraq, (the) Prime Minister conveyed that India values and would like to further strengthen the bonds of friendship between (the) two countries and peoples, and would be happy to assist in the reconstruction of Iraq and cooperation in areas of mutual interest,? a statement issued by the foreign ministry said.

 During the visit of US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage to India last year, New Delhi had expressed its willingness to play a significant role in the reconstruction of Iraq by training Iraqi policemen, teachers, nurses, IT personnel, diplomats and administrative staff.

 Though this has been the Indian position for several months now, it was not willing to get involved in Iraq till the return of political stability in the strife-torn country.

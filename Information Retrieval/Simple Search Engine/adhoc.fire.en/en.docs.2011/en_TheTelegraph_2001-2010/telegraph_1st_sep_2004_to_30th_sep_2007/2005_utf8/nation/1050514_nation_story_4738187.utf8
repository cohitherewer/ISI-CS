 Whistle blower probe nod

 New Delhi, May 13: The Supreme Court today asked the CBI to proceed with investigations against IAS whistle blower Sanjiv Kumar who had alleged irregularities in the appointment of 3000 teachers in Haryana, reports our legal correspondent.

 The court also withdrew its earlier order that the CBI should not arrest him or proceed with the case. There had been fears that the agency launched its probe on the rebound after Kumar blew the whistle.

 Modifying its interim order, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti said the CBI could proceed if it felt Kumar was as corrupt as others in the scam.

 Kumars petition had alleged that former chief minister .P. Chautala had taken money for appointment of 3000 primary teachers during his tenure, on which the court had already ordered a CBI inquiry.

 The court said any decision to arrest Kumar should be vetted by the CBI director. 

 It asked the Haryana government to make changes in the chargesheet against Kumar as sought by the Central Vigilance Commission, which would then take the proceedings to the logical conclusion.

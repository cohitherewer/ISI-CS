 Arson heat on Naidu

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Jan. 28: Telugu Desam chief Chandrababu Naidu is facing the heat for the outbreak of violence across the state after the murder of a party MLA in Anantpur town.

 At a news conference today, director-general of police Swaranjit Sen said charges would be pressed against ?all persons responsible for the mindless and indiscriminate violence? and they would be ?arrested?. Sen said the government would move court against the losses to public property in Monday?s arson.

 Following the murder, former Desam minister Nagam Janardhan Reddy had declared that his partymen would ?not stop violence till the Rajasekhar Reddy government is dismissed?. 

 The Desam politburo had reportedly met on Monday afternoon after news of P. Ravindra?s murder broke and had issued directions by teleconference to its district units to agitate against the government, the ruling Congress and the police. 

 The state government today issued a notification for transferring the murder case to the CBI. The police and the crime branch would, however, continue to investigate the case even under the CBI.

 The unrest in the state immediately after Ravindra?s murder took its toll of the economy, too. BPOs and call centres suffered losses of nearly $1 million. According to the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation, nearly 85 buses were torched by mobs. About 550 others were damaged.

 ?The total loss to the corporation on a single day was around Rs 12 crore,? a transport official said.

 The police have booked 2,300 cases and arrested 400 people. ?Many are being interrogated and we may make further arrests as well,? the DGP said. 

 Asked if cases would be filed against Naidu and Desam functionaries, he said all those who ?incited and instigated the party workers to resort to violence will have to face the rule of law?.

 Several former ministers in the erstwhile Naidu government are likely to be hauled up as they were in the forefront of the arson on Monday, which was followed by a bandh the next day.

 The DGP said the IG of Rayalaseema, R.P. Meena, had offered to step aside from the investigation as the Desam had charged him with involvement in the killing. 

 ?Though the FIR does not mention his name we honour his decision but assure that the department has total faith in his integrity.?

 Asked whether the police have interrogated Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, the chief minister?s son, and state minister J.C. Diwakar Reddy for alleged involvement in the Anantpur killing, Sen said the investigation was underway. 

 Security has already been beefed up at Jaganmohan?s Bangalore and Hyderabad residences.

 Sen also said the slain Desam MLA had a criminal background. ?Ravindra began his criminal career at the age of 25 in 1971. By 2004, he was responsible for 54 murders and three kidnappings. Even now we have a pending complaint against him about 10 missing Congressmen in Anantpur district.? 

 Blaming the Desam for the unrest, state Congress president K. Keshav Rao said: ?It was the TDP which had campaigned for making agitators pay for the damages to public property. Why cannot they follow what they preached??

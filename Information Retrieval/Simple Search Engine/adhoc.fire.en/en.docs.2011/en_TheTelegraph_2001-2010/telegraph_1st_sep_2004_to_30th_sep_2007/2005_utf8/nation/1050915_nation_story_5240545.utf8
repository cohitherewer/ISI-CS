 Wanted, musclemen for polls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The musclemen who won the Bihar Assembly elections in February-March but could not sit in the House need not despair. The coming ballot battle may prove to be a better opportunity for bahubalis to flex their muscles.

 As the majority mark in the 243-member Assembly eludes all, musclemen now, more than ever, seem to be in demand. 

 The Congress has quietly relaxed its norms for selecting candidates. In the last elections, the party had not considered aspirants with criminal antecedents while giving party tickets.

 In Bihar, our experience of fighting past elections has suggested that it is virtually not possible to be a serious contender if the candidate does not have the backing of muscle power. Without muscle power it is not even possible for candidates to undertake serious campaigning, particularly in rural constituencies, said a top party poll manager. 

 The poll managers are understood to have approached Congress president Sonia Gandhi to get the norms for selection of candidates relaxed at least in constituencies where rival party candidates are bahubalis. The party leadership, too, has agreed to this. 

 So the search is on in the state to identify candidates in the musclemen category. We will have to turn a blind eye to the candidates criminal antecedents. We will presume that a person is innocent until he is proved guilty. That is what Atal Bihari Vajpayee has said often. In Bihar we will follow this maxim, said a party leader who has been instructed to look out for bahubali candidates. 

 But it is a task that is proving daunting, said another Congress leader. Fifty per cent of the known bahubalis are with the Janata Dal (United) and the remaining 50 per cent are with the RJD, he said. 

 The Congress had its share of musclemen but most of them left the party as it avoided giving them tickets. Some of them moved over to other parties and the rest became independent candidates. One of them has demonstrated his strength by winning two elections since 1995 as an independent candidate, a party functionary pointed out to underscore the clout of musclemen in Bihar elections. 

 The party also lost Ragho Singh ? one of the few prominent musclemen left in the Congress ? when he was murdered recently. 

 Party leaders said Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan too was looking for musclemen to fight for his party. Almost two-thirds of the 29 candidates who won from the LJP in the last Assembly polls were known musclemen.

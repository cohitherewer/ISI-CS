 Tsunami panic revisits Tamil Nadu 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES 

 Feb. 19: Water was sucked out from the Kanyakumari coast this morning revealing about 15 metres of the seabed and sparking panic among the people who interpreted it as sign of another tsunami in a throwback to the killer waves of the December. 

 A day after Christmas last year, water had receded dramatically from Kanyakumari almost an hour before the tsunami ? pumped up by a deadly earthquake off the Sumatra coast ? lashed the Tamil Nadu coast, killing thousands. 

 Their fear wasn?t unfounded as today?s phenomenon too seems to have been triggered by an earthquake in Indonesia that measured 6.9 on the Richter scale ? large enough to cause casualties, damage and a tsunami, said the Indonesian meteorological agency. 

 The US National Earthquake Information Centre in Colorado gave an initial reading of 6.5 for the quake. 

 This time, the epicentre was off Buton island of Indonesia?s eastern Sulawesi region ? closer to Australia than to India. The western Sumatra island is nearer than the Indian mainland to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 

 After the quake at 5.34 am (IST), Kanyakumari district collector Sunil Paliwal told The Telegraph that he could not confirm ?initial reports? about water receding from the shoreline this morning. 

 But the Poompuhar Shipping Corporation, which operates the ferry service between the mainland and Vivekananda Rock off Kanyakumari, was asked to stop plying as a precautionary measure. 

 ?I immediately contacted the meteorological office in Chennai which said today?s earthquake in Indonesia was only 6.5 on the Richter scale and hence there was no risk of another tsunami,? Paliwal said. 

 But an official of the Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Agency in Jakarta felt otherwise. ?A tsunami is a possible situation? The jolt was felt in Buton island and waters around it rose three to four metres?,? said Rachmat Triono. 

 Later, the agency said though people were fleeing to higher ground in Buton and other areas where the tremors were felt, there were no immediate reports of any deaths or big waves. 

 ?However, we are telling people to keep their calm as there is no tsunami. They fled without orders as they thought they would face something like Aceh,? said the official. 

 The ferry service to Vivekananda Rock resumed towards evening. The ?wave action near the coast was normal?, Paliwal said the corporation?s manager had told him. 

 In Nagapattinam, the district devastated by the tsunami, the day brought joy. District collector J. Radhakrishnan presided over the wedding of six couples from the fishing community. The marriages were fixed for last year but pushed back by the tsunami. 

 The simple ceremonies were conducted according to Hindu customs at Nagore, a pilgrim centre for Muslims. A Christian NGO had organised the weddings.

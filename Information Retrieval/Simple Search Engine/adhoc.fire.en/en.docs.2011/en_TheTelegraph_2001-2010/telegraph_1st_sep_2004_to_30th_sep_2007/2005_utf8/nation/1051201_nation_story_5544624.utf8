 Brahmos 

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: The testing of the supersonic cruise missile Brahmos entered a new phase today when army personnel fired its land version near Balasore in Orissa for the first time.

 The cruise missile was tested around 11 am. The ministry of defence said the entire trial was handled by the army. 

 The move is significant as the Brahmos is ready to be installed on Indian naval warships. It has already been installed on Rajput class ships.

 Defence scientists termed the test perfect as all the mission objectives were met.

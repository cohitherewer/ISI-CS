 London, Feb. 4: Finance 

 minister Palaniappan Chidambaram today pressed a button 

 at 8 am sharp (1.30 pm IST), to signal the start of trading 

 on the London Stock Exchange. 

 Afterwards, Chidambaram, who is taking part in the G7 meeting of finance ministers, said: ?It was an honour which they give to visiting ministers. There are 18 Indian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange and this was a recognition of India?s growing economic power.?

 Another indicator of Chidambaram?s growing power is that there was a queue of journalists waiting to interview him at the Crown Plaza Hotel in London. The more important ones got 10 minutes.

 Chidambaram told The Telegraph he was confident that the present Indian government would last its full five-year term ?because the BJP is in disarray?, there was no desire for another general election and that he would give top priority to development in the agricultural sector.

 Asked how he intended to ensure development was fairer between rich and poor states, the minister said it was up to voters to choose the right government in the states.

 Speaking at a conference organised as part of the G7 meeting, he said: ?Today India is confident and optimistic... This has given us foundational strengths for erecting a mix of policies that will push the trend rate of growth further.? 

 Chidambaram, scheduled to present the budget later this month, added: ?There is tremendous energy and spirit of experimentation that have been unleashed. India today is a beehive of ambitious individuals and firms.?

 A spokesperson for the LSE made it clear that since its new building was opened by the Queen on July 27 last year, very few visiting dignitaries have opened trading.

 Chidambaram opened the market by setting in motion ?The Source?, the LSE?s dynamic sculpture positioned in the main atrium of its new building at Paternoster Square. He was joined by Martin Graham, the LSE?s director of market services, and Indian diplomats.

 The sculpture consists of 729 spheres, suspended on metal cables stretching the full height of the seven-storey atrium. Controlled electronically, each sphere moves independently, forming random shifting patterns of words, numbers and shapes fed in directly from the world?s media.

 The LSE has 18 Indian companies listed with a total market capitalisation of $2.94 billion. 

 In addition, there are nine Indian companies with depository receipts traded on the exchange. During 2004, two Indian companies, ACC Ltd. and Amtek Motors, successfully raised funds in excess of $100 million when they issued depository receipts.

 Graham, said: ?The London Stock Exchange is delighted to welcome Mr Chidambaram and to highlight the strong economic links between the UK and India. There is a high level of international investor demand to share in the success of the Indian economy and London has been a conduit through which international capital has contributed to the growth of Indian companies and its wider economy.?

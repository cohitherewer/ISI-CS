 Plea against CEC quashed

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 dismissed a petition challenging the appointment of B.B. 

 Tandon as chief election commissioner over his reported 

 casteist remarks.

 L.V. Saptharishi, the special election observer in Chhapra during the Lok Sabha elections, had said Tandon and election commissioner N. Gopalaswamy had made derogatory remarks against the Yadav community.

 Justice Gita Mittal declined to entertain a petition filed by the All India Yadav Mahasabha, saying it was misconceived and premature. 

 The judge held that the veracity of the letter by Saptharishi could not be ascertained on the basis of newspaper reports under Article 226.

 The court added since the Centre has initiated an inquiry and taken steps to ascertain the veracity of the allegations, any judicial interference would have a bearing on the probe.

 The court, however, permitted the petitioner to file a fresh writ if it felt aggrieved by the inquiry report.

 The Mahasabhas counsel, Anand Yadav and Pravin Chandra, have been asked to file an affidavit disclosing the source of Saptharishis letter to the Union law minister.

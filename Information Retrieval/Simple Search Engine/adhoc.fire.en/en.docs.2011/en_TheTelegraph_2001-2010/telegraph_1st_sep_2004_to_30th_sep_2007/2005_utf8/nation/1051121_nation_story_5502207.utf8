 Jamshedpur, Nov. 20: Come 2006 and the Xavier Labour Relations Institute (XLRI) Aptitude Test (XAT) will have a new format as the general knowledge section will be replaced with data interpretation.

 The XLRI authorities said the change in the entrance test format will be implemented from the next session as most of the candidates fail to score good marks in the general knowledge section.

 The XLRI board of governors has approved the decision of the admission committee. 

 The change in the format of the entrance test is being implemented after about four decades.

 Chairperson (admission) Sanjay Patro said the introduction of the data interpretation section would test the managerial skills of aspirants. The decision was taken after a series of brainstorming sessions by the admission committee, he said.

 Patro added that so far, the XAT entrance examination has been approved by 30 B-schools across the country. However, from next year, 11 more management schools, including SP Jain (Mumbai) and Mudra Institute of Communication, will be added to the list.

 The two-hour duration and other rules and regulations for the entrance test will remain the same, he said. Besides data interpretation, candidates will be quizzed on two other areas ? verbal ability and quantitative aptitude.

 Officials said that last year, about 50,000 candidates had appeared in the XAT examination conducted in 65 centres across 31 cities. 

 The Common Aptitude Test conducted for admission to Indian Institutes of Management and other top-notch B-schools of the country does not have a general knowledge or current affairs section.

 XLRI authorities said this is also one of the reasons why they decided to scrap the general knowledge section from the entrance examination.

 The XAT examination is scheduled to be held on January 8 and the last date of registration is November 30.

 A candidate for XAT-2006 welcomed the change. The data interpretation section will help in judging the candidates business and managerial acumen, he said.

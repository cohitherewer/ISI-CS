 Seer moves SC for case shift

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Kancheepuram, March 31: Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati petitioned the Supreme Court to transfer the trial against him in the Shankar Raman murder case outside Tamil Nadu on a day all the 24 accused in the case were given copies of the chargesheet.

 The seer?s petition alleged that Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa and the state government were evincing ?particular? and ?undue? interest in the case and wanted to ?frame? him.

 The petition filed through the advocate-on-record, M. Krishnakumar, claimed that the manner in which cases were foisted one after the other on the acharya and the selective leaking of information proved that the government wanted to ?somehow? frame him for the murder of the manager of the Sri Varadraja Perumal temple on September 3, rather than conduct a ?free and fair? trial.

 Krishnakumar pointed out that the pontiff was accused in the assault of Radhakrishna even before the chargesheet was filed in the murder case. 

 He added that the acharya?s interrogation was videographed and select portions were leaked to some television channels and photographs depicting him breaking down were distributed to the media.

 The petition said the investigating officers in the murder case were ?handpicked? by Jayalalithaa, who was also issuing statements that could prejudice the case.

 The seer?s petition also pointed out that the chargesheet in the murder case was filed on January 21 but it was not served on him for three months.

 Copies of the chargesheet were given to the acharya, junior pontiff Vijayendra Saraswati and the 22 other accused, in the court of the first judicial magistrate of Kancheepuram, G. Uthamaraj, amid heated arguments and delay over procedure.

 Proceedings in the Kancheepuram court were first held up for 90 minutes because of the late arrival of Appu, the alleged kingpin of the killer gang, from Cuddalore jail. 

 The delay gave the two acharyas an opportunity to meet inside Jayendra Saraswati?s Tempo Traveller until the proceedings began at noon.

 In court, some key accused such as the mutt?s former manager, Sundaresa Iyer, and the junior pontiff?s brother, Raghu, conferred with the senior pontiff.

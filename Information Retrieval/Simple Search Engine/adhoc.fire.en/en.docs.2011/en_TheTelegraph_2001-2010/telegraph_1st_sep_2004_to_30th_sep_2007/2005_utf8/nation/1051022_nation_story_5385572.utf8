 Ganja amp; kerosene threat to Rabri

 NALIN VERMA

 Raghopur (Vaishali), Oct. 21: Raghopur, Rabri Devis constituency, lives in the lantern age, literally.

 The roads linking the villages are cracked and unmotorable, and boats are the only transport available. Though a few villages saw overhead wires and poles installed two years ago, they are yet to see electricity arrive at their homes.

 Yet Raghopurs predominantly Yadav voters had been voting lantern (the Rashtriya Janata Dals symbol) for the past 15 years. The reason was simple: the Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi regimes let them grow hemp in peace.

 No longer. A relentless crackdown on the ganja racket here by the police, under directions from the poll panel, has queered the pitch for Rabri on her home turf.

 Raghopur, a stretch of sandy earth hemmed in by the Ganga and Gandak on all sides, has been the nerve centre of ganja production in central Bihar for decades, along with the Masarh area of Bhojpur.

 We are poor farmers. We grew ganja plants with the sole intention of earning some cash. We dont know why these policemen are harassing us. They raid our farms and pick up our boys, complained Ram Pravesh Rai at Mallipur.

 Many disappointed villagers said they would not vote for Rabri on October 25. How can we defend her when she has failed to defend us against the police action? asked one on condition of anonymity.

 The tough chief election commissioner, B.B. Tandon, is said to be on a mission to round up ganja growers, smugglers and arms dealers to try and ensure a free and fair election.

 You wont find ganja plantations in Raghopur any more. We have put an end to its cultivation, said Vaishali superintendent of police Preeta Verma, whom The Telegraph found patrolling the super-sensitive constituency with her forces.

 Anyone who would try that in the past would have paid for it. Former excise commissioner G.S. Kang was shunted out as soon as he had cracked down on Raghopurs ganja growers.

 Rabri was chief minister then. This time, out of office, she might pay for failing to protect her clansmen against the police drives in Mallipur, Mohanpur, Rustampur and other villages in her constituency.

 Rabri faces another acute problem: a shortage of kerosene in the electricity-starved area.

 We get kerosene only twice a year and only one to two litres per family, said Musaheb Rai at Mohapur.

 Another villager shouted in anger: How can we light Laloos lantern when we have no kerosene to light our own lamps and lanterns?

 Rabri is up against a third hurdle: her Janata Dal (United) opponent. Satish Kumar, a Yadav, was Rabris main poll manager till he crossed over to Nitish Kumars party. He is said to be privy to all the machinations that Laloo Prasad and Rabri might try in their attempt to retain the seat.

 The administration will be keeping a close watch on the sensitive constituency on polling day.

 We shall carry out patrolling around the constituency by boats on the day of voting, the Vaishali superintendent of police said.

 The administration will hire all the boats available on the banks of the Ganga and Gandak. Outsiders will not be allowed to cross the river from Fatuha in Patna to Raghopur on that day.

 Ten paramilitary companies have been already ferried into Raghopur.

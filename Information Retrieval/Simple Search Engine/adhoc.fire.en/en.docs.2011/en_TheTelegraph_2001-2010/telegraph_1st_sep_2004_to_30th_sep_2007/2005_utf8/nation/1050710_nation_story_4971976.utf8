 Priests chant peace mantra

 Ayodhya, July 9: Thick smoke curled lazily from the burning incense sticks. A young Buddhist monk sat with a drum in his hands.

 Before him was a small photograph of Mahatma Gandhi, an idol of Buddha and a picture of a mosque.

 Seki Guchi, a 32-year-old Japanese, was deep in prayer ? for peace and harmony in this troubled town of more than a hundred temples.

 A kilometre away from the ravaged grounds where the Babri mosque once stood, curious visitors trooped into Satya Mandir. On Wednesday, a special prayer for peace was held in this all-faith temple, which was built after the mosque was brought down in 1992.

 As political shrapnel flies in the wake of the terror attack on the makeshift Ram temple, priests in this ancient town have taken it upon themselves to preserve social and communal harmony.

 Guchi, who has been living in Ayodhya for the past three years, is one of them. His words ? Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo ? are different, but it is a mantra for peace.

 A member of Nipponzan Myooheji, a Buddhist sect that draws inspiration from Gandhijis philosophy of non-violence, Guchi says the July 5 blast has shaken his peace of mind. I heard the blast and woke up from my meditation, he says. Now his prayer is his penance ? not for himself but for peace.

 At Satya Mandir, a temple built by a Gujarati monk, chief priest Swami Satyabhaktji says hundreds visit out of curiosity but return with their mind at peace.

 Bhai Satya Snehi ? the ailing mahant of the all-faith temple that has marble statues of Ram, Sita, Buddha, Mahavir, Jesus and Zarathustra, who is revered by Zoroastrians, and a bronze crescent and star which represents all major religions ? says the shrine upholds the spirit of Ayodhya. Even during the riots of 1992, very few incidents of violence were reported in the town.

 Near Hanumangarhi temple, where Mahant Gyan Das sits, is a large canvas on which temples, mosques and gurdwaras form a geometric design. This theme has brought together many monks who are fighting the communally charged atmosphere in the town after the blast, says Das, the head of the All India Akhara Parishad, a trust of sadhus.

 These terrorists have no god, no religion. Their aim is to peddle terror. They were checked in a swift operation and we should be thankful for that, but we have to remain cautious, too.

 Priests are not the only ones who are talking of the spirit of Ayodhya. The man who supplies flowers to all the temples here is living proof that religious harmony has survived through the years. He is a Muslim.

 We have been in this profession for long, says Anis Mohammad. This speaks of the fact that social coexistence between Muslims and Hindus here date back to hundreds of years.

 Natwar fires dud missile, Cong stirs

Australia probes, Delhi 

debunks 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: On a day the Australian Prime Minister ordered a probe into the oil-for-food scandal in his country, Indian foreign minister Natwar Singh held up Americas discredited report on weapons of mass destruction to challenge the credibility of an investigation that linked him to a deal with the Saddam Hussein regime.

 Natwar Singh said today the Paul Volcker report that named him one of the beneficiaries of Iraqs oil-for-food programme was no more credible than the one that led America to attack Baghdad in its search for weapons of mass destruction.

 The ministers comments are being seen as part of an attempt to strengthen his anti-US constituency, especially among the Left, in the country. The Left has demanded an inquiry but has also said the UN sanctions on Iraq were illegal.

 The report has as much validity as the report by the CIA director about the alleged existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the foreign minister told PTI. 

 We have it from no less an authority than Colin Powell who publicly stated that he was given false information on WMDs, which he conveyed to the UN Security Council as the US secretary of state, he added.

 Natwar Singh also sought to rope in his party ? the Congress has been named a beneficiary ? by saying that this is obviously part of the continuing campaign to malign the Congress party and its senior leaders and functionaries.

 The Congress, which had left the minister to fend for himself and concentrated on defending itself when the controversy broke, today sought to close the chapter by replaying Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement yesterday that the report had insufficient evidence.

 On Saturday, the Congress had conspicuously avoided defending Natwar Singh, though his party position as the head of the AICC foreign affairs cell makes him a key adviser to Sonia Gandhi. The party changed its stand after Natwar Singh met the Prime Minister as well as Sonia. 

 The foreign ministry establishment, which dragged its feet on defending the minister, tried to control the damage today by putting the statements of Natwar Singh ? two days after he issued it ? and the Prime Minister on its website.

 The Congress saw no reason for an inquiry into the allegations as demanded by the Left parties.

 Inquiry against whom and for what? We dont think there is any room for that. The report is full of gaping holes and glaring errors, party spokesman Anand Sharma said. 

 He did not rule out taking legal steps to defend the party and the minister.

 But Australia set an example with Prime Minister John Howard ordering an independent probe to establish whether a domestic wheat company broke any law by making payments to Iraq under the oil-for-food programme. According to the Volcker report, AWB Ltd was the largest single supplier of humanitarian goods under the programme.

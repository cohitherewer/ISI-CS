 NRI cafe workers in Qatar face axe

 Dubai (PTI): About 10,000 workers, mainly from Kerala, face a bleak future as small restaurants in Qatar face closure because of stricter guidelines being implemented by the authorities from October 1.

 These workers face a bleak future as they stand to lose employment. Many of them are single breadwinners for their large families back home, a media report said.

 A daily quoted many of those who are running these outlets as saying that if the guidelines being enforced were to do only with cleanliness and safety of the workers, they would be too glad to follow them.

 But extending the area of the outlets and getting double doors instead of single ones is next to impossible, a cafeteria manager said.

 Tiff over cancelled Jet flight

 Leh (PTI): More than 400 passengers, stranded at Kushok Bakula Rinpochey Airport after a Jet Airways flight was cancelled, engaged in scuffle with the airline staff over unconvincing reasons for the non-operation. 

 The passengers, including foreign tourists, became restless because of non-operation of flights on Friday and Saturday, as they had connecting flights to catch.

 The passengers claimed that the Indian Airlines flight, which was scheduled around the same time as that of Jet Airways, landed at the airport but the latter did not operate. The Jet airline staff said flights had been cancelled because of a strong tail wind.

 The passengers tried to vandalise the counters of the airline at the airport but order was restored after they were promised that two additional flights would be operated to fly them out of Leh.

 Inmates flee

 CHhatarpur (PTI): Nine inmates of a juvenile home, facing charges including murder, escaped on Friday night.

 The boys, aged between 14 and 18, fled at midnight, breaking open the main door. The matter was brought to the authorities notice on Saturday by the 13 other inmates of the home in this district of Madhya Pradesh, police said.

 Custody death

 jAipur (PTI): A 20-year-old died in police custody on Friday. Jitu, summoned in connection with an assault on one Kanhaiya Gurjar, collapsed complaining of chest pain while eating food served to him from the police mess, police said.

 Rap on engineers

 Lucknow (PTI): Five engineers, including a chief engineer of the Uttar Pradesh public works department, have been suspended on charges of financial irregularities after the minister concerned inspected a highway under construction.

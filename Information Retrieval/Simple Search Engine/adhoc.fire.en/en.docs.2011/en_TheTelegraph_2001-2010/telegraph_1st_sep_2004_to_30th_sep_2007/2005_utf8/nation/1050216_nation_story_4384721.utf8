 Bengal nod needed for settlers? list

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 15: The Orissa government has directed the Kendrapara district administration to prepare a fresh list of settlers, separating those who have come from West Bengal from the enumerated 1,548 illegal Bangladeshi migrants staying in Mahakalpada block.

 The Kendrapara administration will have to submit the list to the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government within a fortnight for its approval. 

 Earlier, the authorities had served the ?Quit India? notice on these immigrants, asking them to leave the country by February 23. 

 Kendrapara district magistrate Hemant Sharma told The Telegraph that the state home department communicated the order yesterday. Consequently, they will now issue a fresh notice to the 1,548 immigrants in question, asking them to produce relevant documentary evidence to prove that they are migrants from neighbouring Bengal.

 ?Since quite a few of the enumerated people had said in their petitions to the President and Prime Minister that they had come to Orissa from West Bengal in search of livelihood, we need to verify the documents once again,? he added.

 The Mahakalpada tehsildar is understood to have started the exercise of making a fresh list. 

 Earlier, the Centre had asked the state to discuss the matter with the Bengal government and ascertain the genuineness of the claims of the settlers. 

 The home department?s instructions came in the wake of the recent central directive, which put the deportation of Bangladeshi settlers on hold following complaints of irregularities. 

 The settlers had earlier alleged that the notice was ?arbitrary?, as even dead people were included on the deportation list.

 Last week, the Centre had stalled the deportation process by seeking clarifications from the Naveen Patnaik government on the list of Bangladeshi migrants. 

 The Union home ministry wanted to know the basis on which the state government identified the settlers and whether it followed the guidelines while formulating the list.

 The list of Bengali-speaking families in Mahakalpada block would be sent to the state home department, which would forward it to its Bengal counterpart for verification and approval. 

 While the state government wanted to go ahead with the deportation without any fuss, the hue and cry raised over the issue could end up stalling the process for several years.

 Several Bangladeshi settlers of Mahakalapada, having received a breather, have petitioned the Bengal government to influence its Orissa counterpart in their favour while preparing the revised list.

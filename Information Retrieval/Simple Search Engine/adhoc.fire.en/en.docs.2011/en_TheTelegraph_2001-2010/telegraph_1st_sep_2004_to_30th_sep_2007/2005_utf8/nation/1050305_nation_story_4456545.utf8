 Hooda head, Bhajan bawls

 March 4: Bhupinder Singh Hooda will be the new chief minister of Haryana, bringing the curtains down on Bhajan Lal?s hopes. 

 The Jat leader will be sworn in in Chandigarh tomorrow. 

 Hooda, who led a campaign to deny chief ministership to Bhajan Lal for a fourth term, was formally elected leader of the Congress legislature party at a specially convened meeting in New Delhi this evening. 

 A bruised Bhajan Lal boycotted the meeting along with his loyalists.

 Hooda?s chances of becoming chief minister were bright even before the meeting started at 4 pm. Party chief Sonia Gandhi had met Bhajan Lal in the morning to persuade him to give up his claim to the chair with offers of a governor?s post for him and deputy chief ministership for his elder son Chander Mohan ? both of which he turned down. 

 A dejected Bhajan Lal, who announced his decision to quit as state party chief, stayed put at the house of his MP son Kuldip Bishnoi as his supporters shouted slogans against Sonia and Hooda outside. 

 Apprehending trouble, the government had deployed the Rapid Action Force around the Parliament annexe building ? the venue of the meeting. 

 Forty-seven MLAs elected Hooda ?unanimously? after his name was proposed by legislator Kartar Devi and seconded by Birender Singh, himself a strong contender for the job. 

 Hooda, a Jat MP from Rohtak, made reconciliatory noises after getting the better of his arch rival. ?The Congress is a family and such things do happen. It will be my endeavour that the whole family remains together and everyone is accorded proper respect,? he said.

 The Congress leadership has taken Bhajan Lal?s boycott in its stride. ?In politics, one conducts (himself) in the light of his hopes and aspirations. But everything will be all right,? said AICC general secretary in charge of Haryana Janardhan Dwivedi. 

 Bhajan Lal, however, has threatened to give vent to his anger at a conference tomorrow.

 With Hooda on the throne, Jats owing allegiance to the Congress have reasons to rejoice. After a gap of 19 years, the Congress has rewarded another son of the community.

 The Congress?s landslide victory in the Assembly polls followed massive support from the community. 

 Hooda?s bete noire Bhajan Lal?s claims to the crown would have been the strongest had the Congress fared poorly in the Jat heartland. 

 A Congress leader explained: ?It now remains to be seen how Hooda manages to keep Bhajan Lal, who enjoys enormous support among all castes in the state and even legislators, quiet.

 ?He can perform freely only if Bhajan Lal is expelled from the party or shifted out of the state. The constant back-stabbing against each other when they were together in the Assembly? before Hooda was given the Lok Sabha ticket last year is still fresh in the minds of the people.?

 He expressed fear that there might be trouble for the party in the next couple of months.

 Bhajan Lal?s supporters have been piling scorn on the Congress for resorting to caste politics for the first time in the state. 

 ?Hooda?s ambition to become CM may have been achieved but the Congress house will fall like a pack of cards under him as had happened when he took over as state president in 1997. The party kept losing till Bhajan Lal took over and rejuvenated the workers. Wait and see what will happen to the party under his chief ministership,? a Congress leader cautioned.

 Bhajan Lal said he was down but not out. ?Aap aagey ka sochiye aur dekhiye kya hota hai (Think about the future and see what happens),? he said.

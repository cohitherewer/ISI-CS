 Notice sent to farmer Amitabh

 Pune (PTI): Amitabh Bachchan, who has acquired 20 acres of agricultural land near Lonavala in Pune, has been asked by the district authorities to authenticate his claim of being a farmer. 

 Bachchan purchased the land in 2000, getting it registered in his name on the basis of documents allegedly proclaiming him to be a farmer at Jaunpur near New Delhi.

 We began an inquiry following a report in a news magazine about the purchase of agricultural land by Bachchan, a senior district official said. 

 The notice was issued to the actor a fortnight ago. 

 Under the Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act, 1963, only farmers can buy agricultural land in the state. 

 We have asked for original documents to be presented by November 25. The registration was done on the basis of Xerox copies, the official said. 

 Smoke missive to Shahrukh

 New Delhi (PTI): Shahrukh Khans pledge to quit smoking has come in for praise from Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, who has sought the actors cooperation in campaigning against the habit.

 Ramadoss has written a letter to Shahrukh, saying such a public health pronouncement by a charismatic personality like him would go a long way in weaning the youth away from tobacco.

 The letter said the actors pledge on the eve of his 40th birthday has come at a time when the government is taking a series of measures to raise awareness about the hazards of tobacco and smoking in particular.

 Bike tangle

 Phagwara (PTI): Several two-wheelers got entangled with a shunting goods train at the Satnampura level crossing on Monday after four bikers jumped over the closed barrier.

 They tried to skirt the girders of the crossing, ignoring a warning sign. One scooter was sucked in and hit by the train which led to damage to other bikes. 

 Children burnt

 Simbhavni (PTI): A mother burnt her four children to death and later attempted suicide at Saina village in Uttar Pradesh. Begjahan is battling for life in a Meerut hospital with 80 per cent burns. A family feud and poverty led to the incident, police said. 

 Fernandes

 Bangalore: Lawrence Fernandes, the brother of Samata Party leader George Fernandes, died here on Monday. Lawrence, among those who suffered the most in prison during the Emergency, was 74. 

The Leonid meteor showers will reach the peak on Thursday and will be visible till November 25. This years showers are expected to be weaker compared to the 1998 event.

 Delhi cool to force-free Kashmirs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: India reacted circumspectly to Pakistan President Pervez Musharrafs proposal to demilitarise both sides of Kashmir, saying it cannot be done unilaterally.

 It cant be done unilaterally, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh told reporters at Rashtrapati Bhavan after Y.K. Sabharwal was sworn in Chief Justice of India.

 After all, they (Pakistan) are in occupation of our areas.

 Natwar also had a word of advice for Musharraf. Over-verbalising does not help. Every second day there is a statement from that side.

 He made it clear he would have to study the Pakistan Presidents comments and the context in which they were made before offering a definite view.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh refused comment on the proposal. Musharraf had said yesterday the quake provided India and Pakistan a great opportunity to work towards resolving the Kashmir dispute and urged India to think of demilitarising the zone to help the quake-hit on both sides of the LoC.

 At a news conference in Rawalpindi, Musharraf suggested that as the two countries had agreed to open up the LoC at five points, they could now take a number of steps to resolve the Kashmir dispute. The suggestion was, however, governed by a series of tough-sounding caveats.

 Musharraf, for instance, ruled out a cut in defence expenditure, saying that while Pakistan had to meet the challenge posed by the quake, it could not afford to jeopardise security and defence.

 He also attributed Pakistans refusal to have Indian helicopters and crew help with relief ? he accepted similar offers from other countries ? to mutual distrust and suspicion and the sensitivities that go with defence on both sides of the LoC.

 We have only been fighting wars and it is not correct to expect cooperation immediately, he said.

 Singh made it clear to Musharraf that Delhi expected Islamabad to act against terrorism directed at India. Observers believe Singh tersely told him ? during a phone call Musharraf made ? that Pakistan had made a commitment to end cross-border terror and India could not be expected to be endlessly patient in the face of continuing strikes.

 Observers also say India cannot be seen as going soft on Pakistan on any aspect of bilateral relations, including quake-related work, after the Delhi blasts because it may expose the soft underbelly of its policy to combat terror.

 The BJP has attacked the government for repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act and held the absence of a strong anti-terror law responsible for the major strikes in the recent past. 

 BJP sources said they would raise this issue in a big way in Parliament.

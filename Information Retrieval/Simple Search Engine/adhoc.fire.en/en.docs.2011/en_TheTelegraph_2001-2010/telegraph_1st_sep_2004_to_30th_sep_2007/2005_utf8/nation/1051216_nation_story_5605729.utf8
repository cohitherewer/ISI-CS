 PM clears air on US nuke pact

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: As the Indo-US nuke deal faced the scrutiny of the US Congress today, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told Parliament the agreement had not hit a roadblock and that Delhi could back off if Washington did not honour its commitments.

 Several MPs expressed concern over the five-month-old understanding, prompting Singh to clear the air.

 Replying to a volley of questions in the Rajya Sabha, the Prime Minister reiterated that his government was firmly sticking to the principle of reciprocity as outlined in the understanding reached between the two countries on July 18. If the US does not carry out its obligation, I think we are also free not to carry out our obligation, he said on the floor of the House.

 When some MPs raised doubts about the US dictating terms by guiding India on the separation mechanism, the Prime Minister made it clear that the decision to put certain facilities and reactors under international supervision would be solely Indias.

 He said there was no stalemate on the nuclear question and the two sides would carry forward the talks to settle issues about honouring commitments.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran will travel to Washington next week for the nuclear negotiations. He, along with US under-secretary Nicholas Burns, heads the nuclear dialogue mechanism worked out by the two sides to weed out differences. The first round of talks was held here in November and the second will take place in the US capital on December 21 and 22.

 Sources said India is expected to present a blueprint for separating military and civilian reactors. 

 Washington is pressing Delhi to get the plan ready before President George W. Bush arrives in India early next year.

 Some Left Front MPs wanted to know why a foreign secretary was heading the nuclear working group when his counterpart was only an under-secretary. The Prime Minister replied that he did not see any anomaly in that and there have been such instances in the past.

 The nuclear agreement is under the scanner of the international relations committee of US Congress and the Senate foreign affairs committee. 

 The government today said getting the deal approved by US Congress was Washingtons concern. It added that efforts were on to find a satisfactory solution. Congress approval is necessary as American laws would have to be changed to allow nuclear trade with India. The Bush administration has agreed to convince the Congress and allies to ensure full civil nuclear cooperation with India.

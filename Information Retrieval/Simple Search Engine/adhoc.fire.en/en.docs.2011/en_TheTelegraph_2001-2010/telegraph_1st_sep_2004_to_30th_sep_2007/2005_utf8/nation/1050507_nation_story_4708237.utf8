 Fund cloud on shining campaign

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 6: The comptroller and auditor general today pulled up the National Democratic Alliance for spending an unauthorised sum of Rs 62.3 crore, when it was in power, on the media blitz dubbed India Shining.

 The campaign, which failed to brighten the A.B. Vajpayee-led governments chances during last years general elections, was launched on funds that were not voted for by Parliament. ?Not obtaining prior approval of Parliament before incurring expenditure on? a new service or instrument of service was unauthorised,? it said.

 The ministry got the sum through diversion of funds although the campaign was not contemplated in the annual budget.

 From the subhead, ?cooperation with other countries?, Rs 68 crore was re-appropriated to the ?other expenditures? subhead in demand No. 31 ? department of economic affairs for 2003-04, the report said.

 The NDA claimed it had mentioned the expenditure while presenting the demand and had treated it as a provision for supporting an overall, general and imaginative promotion of India. Hence, it was not treated as a new service.

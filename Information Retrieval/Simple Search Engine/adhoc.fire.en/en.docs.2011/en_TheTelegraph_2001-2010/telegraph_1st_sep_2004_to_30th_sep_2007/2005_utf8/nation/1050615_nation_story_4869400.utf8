 Kalam sermon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 14: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today urged governors to rise above politics and uphold the sanctity of their office.

 Governors office is a beacon light in the affairs of the state. While there are many checks and balances provided by the Constitution, the office of the governor has been bestowed with the independence to rise above the day-to-day politics and override compulsions either emanating from the central system or the state system, he said in his inaugural address at the two-day conference of governors.

 The governors role is to distil the best of aspirations of the people from the vicissitudes of politics. It is like preserving the light of dharma.... You have to decide whether you rise to be a first citizen or remain caged in the confines of your political or any other ancestry. If you continue to nurture certain affiliations, many will hesitate in approaching you with suggestions and problems. You will be isolated from a large number of people.

 The speech is being seen in the context of the turmoil in Goa, where a government was sacked, and Bihar, where the Assembly was dissolved.

 Kalam said a governor was a states first citizen and asked the 28 governors and three lieutenant governors present: Can we collectively say that today such a well intended position is upheld by each one of us?

 He quoted from a second century Tamil work, Silapadikaram, to make his point. 

 The errors of great men are like the eclipses of the greater lights. Whoever deviates from righteousness, whether individual or state, is no more than a passing shadow. Let this great thought dwell in all of us and blossom into righteous actions which are all the more important for all of us who deal with the affairs of the people, Kalam said.

 Sandalwood haul in Mumbai

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 24: Mumbai police have seized 12 tonnes of sandalwood valued at Rs 90 lakh from two trucks at Dahisar check naka, one of the two entry points into the city.

 The seizure by the crime branch last night comes on the heels of one of the largest arms hauls in Mumbai in years on Saturday.

 According to the police, the crime branch received specific information and intercepted the trucks. 

 Four persons were arrested under the Indian Forest Act. They have been identified as Kasam Mustafa, 45, R Srinivasan, 48, Deepak Meghani, 40, and Mohammed Salim Mohammed Aslam, 55, and are Andhra Pradesh residents. All four were produced before a local metropolitan court and remanded in judicial custody.

 Following the seizure last week, which was linked to gangster Chhota Rajan, a handling agent, Mukund Patel, was arrested. It is believed that Patel tipped off the crime branch about the sandalwood consignment.

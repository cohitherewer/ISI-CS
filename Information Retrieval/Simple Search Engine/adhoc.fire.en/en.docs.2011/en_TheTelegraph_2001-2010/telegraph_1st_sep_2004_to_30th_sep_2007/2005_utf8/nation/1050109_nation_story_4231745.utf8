 Protest in Cong over JMM deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: A day after it conceded a larger share of seats to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha amidst protests from the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Left allies, pressure mounted on the Congress leadership from within for a review of the Friday seat-sharing deal in Jharkhand.

 Angry over leaving a ?disproportionately? large number of seats to the JMM, the Congress rank and file from Jharkhand today virtually mobbed AICC leaders at the party headquarters here, demanding more seats for the party.

 Working committee member in charge of Jharkhand affairs Harikesh Bahadur was at the receiving end as state Congress leaders flooded him with complaints of a ?raw deal? for the party.

 Virtually gheraoed by the Jharkhand partymen, Harikesh sought to pacify them with a promise to consider ?exchanging some seats? with the JMM. Jharkhand leaders complained that a number of ?winning? Congress seats like Rajmahal, Mahgama and Giridih were sacrificed for the sake of the alliance with the JMM.

 ?We have tried our best in negotiations to get the best arrangement for the Congress. We have done it with honesty and for the good of the party. It was not easy to negotiate. Even now, I assure you that we will try to exchange some seats with the JMM,? Harikesh told the restive crowd. He, however, rejected suggestions that the party break its alliance with the JMM and fight the elections from all 81 seats in the state.

 Speaking to newsmen later, Harikesh said while exchange of some seats with the JMM was possible, the Congress did not intend in the process to break ?coalition maryada?. ?We will not put pressure on the JMM,? he said.

 He also almost ruled out any change in the seat-sharing formula announced yesterday, according to which the Congress takes 33, the JMM 35, RJD 9 and the CPI 2. About the RJD and the CPI?s expectations of getting more seats, he quipped: ?Where are the seats to offer to them??

 AICC secretary R.P.N Singh, Harikesh?s deputy for Jharkhand, too, virtually ruled out any change in the seat-sharing deal in the wake of the RJD and Left resentment.

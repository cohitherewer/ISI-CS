 Leak engineer denied bail in US 

 Honolulu (AP): A US court has refused 

 bail to an Indian-born engineer accused of selling US military 

 secrets to foreign governments.

 The court said Noshir Gowadia was a flight risk because of the highly classified knowledge he possesses. He helped design a system that protects the B-2 stealth bomber from enemy heat-seeking missiles.

 A naturalised US citizen, Gowadia was arrested in October. Each of the six counts of indictments against him carries a maximum 10 years in jail and a $250,000 fine.

 Defence attorney Chris Todd argued that his client suffers from a blood disorder, which requires him to sometimes sleep uninterrupted for 12 hours, which hes not getting in the (federal) detention centre. Todd said with both of his children, wife and all three siblings living in the US, Gowadia is unlikely to flee to another country.

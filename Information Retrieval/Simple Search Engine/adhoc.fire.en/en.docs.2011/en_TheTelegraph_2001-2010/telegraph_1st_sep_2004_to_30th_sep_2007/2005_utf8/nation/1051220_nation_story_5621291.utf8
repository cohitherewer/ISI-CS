 Mulayam scurries to wipe off stain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 19: With charges of disproportionate wealth threatening to sully Mulayam Singh Yadavs clean image, the chief minister and his aides today went on a counter-allegation drive.

 Addressing a news conference here, Mulayam Singh and leaders of his Samajwadi Party alleged that the petition ? which says the chief minister and his family had purchased land worth crores of rupees in Lucknows prime locations ? was a conspiracy hatched by his rivals. 

 They want to put me and my family behind bars and I am ready to do so, but my conspirators will not succeed in their mission of destroying my reputation, Mulayam Singh said.

 The chief ministers slate has been relatively clean so far, unlike that of his rivals ? particularly Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayavati.

 The mud was first raked on December 15, when the PIL filed in the Supreme Court claimed that Mulayam Singh had between June and October 2005 bought 62,000 square feet of land at Vikramaditya Marg at an estimated Rs 50 crore and paid Rs 48.61 lakh to the Lucknow Development Authority. 

 The petition, which added that plots were also purchased in the names of the chief ministers sons, Akhilesh and Prateek, and daughter-in-law Dimple, was backed by signed official papers.

 Even before the PIL came up for hearing, its contents were leaked to a section of the media in Lucknow and it hit the headlines.

 State party president Ramsaran Das today slammed the media for splashing the details of the petition. This is part of the conspiracy hatched to malign the image of Mr Yadav, who is known for his honesty, he told the news meet. Das, however, refused to comment on the veracity of the facts published in the newspapers.

 The BJP and the Congress demanded that Mulayam Singh come clean on the controversy. Instead of blaming other political parties, the chief minister should issue a clarification, said state Congress chief Salman Khursheed.

 Court cracks whip for fair polls 

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Jan. 5: There are over 15,000 criminals in Bihar against whom non-bailable warrants and/or property attachment orders are pending, Patna High Court was informed today.

 The staggering figure was provided by inspector-general of police (headquarters), Neelmani, who has been asked by the court to furnish a complete list of such criminals by this Friday. 

 While the IG pleaded for more time, a month to be precise, the court remained firm and refused to allow any extension. 

 The hearing of a PIL filed by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) was thereafter adjourned till Friday.

 In a bid to ensure free and fair Assembly elections in Bihar, the court ordered superintendents of police of all districts to furnish the names of absconding criminals against whom non-bailable arrest warrants and/or property attachment orders are pending. 

 The court gave the order to help the Election Commission ensure that such criminals were not able to file their nominations for the coming Assembly elections. It also observed that the criminals should be arrested if they turn up to file their nominations.

 A division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S.N. Hussain directed the superintendents of police to submit the lists to the respective returning officers as well.

 ?The lists should remain with the returning officers (district magistrates) so that they can prevent those mentioned on the lists from filing their nominations and also arrest them,? the bench ruled. It has also directed the SPs to submit the lists before the court on the same date and asked state director-general of police Narayan Mishra and chief electoral officer K.C. Saha to be present in the court during the next hearing on Friday.

 ?No law-breaker should be allowed to become a law-maker,? the bench observed.

 Today?s hearing of the PIL filed by advocate Mahendra Prasad Gupta on behalf of the state unit of the IMA was earlier scheduled for January 10. But Gupta yesterday pleaded with the court to advance the hearing before the nomination process begins on January 10. ?The IG wanted a month?s time to furnish the full list,? he added.

 Directing the police to act promptly, the bench said, ?No one should be allowed to make a mockery of the law at any cost.? 

 ?This move will help the state make the coming polls free, fair and fearless. All criminals should be kept away from the electoral process,? Gupta said.

 ?Section 33 A (2) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 should be enforced in the right spirit so that all candidates have to file affidavits on their criminal background personally before the returning officers, whereby they can be arrested promptly,? Gupta said in response to Neelmani?s observation that a candidate need not appear personally to file nomination papers.

 Advocate Gupta also sought the high court?s ?effective intervention? in ensuring that criminals on the run were put behind bars before they tried their luck at the hustings.

 Gupta had challenged the provision for allowing jailed criminals to contest elections before last year?s Lok Sabha elections. 

 ?That case is still pending with the Supreme Court. Hopefully, it will pass a historical order sometime, which will mark a turning point in our democracy by making elections truly free and fair,? he said.

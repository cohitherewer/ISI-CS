 New Delhi, April 10: Anaaroo Begum is all dressed up to meet Pervez Musharraf when he arrives here on Saturday. The trouble is the 70-year-old hasn?t got an invite.

 Which means she may not get to meet the man she used to babysit as a 12-year-old.

 Sitting on a porch in a Daryaganj lane that winds down to Naharwali Haveli, the pre-Partition ancestral home of the Musharraf family, Anaaroo remembers being nanny to the future Pakistan President.

 She recalls with pride her last meeting with the child who grew up to be ?badshah?. ?Amma, kaisi ho,? is how Musharraf had greeted her on his way to the Agra summit in July 2001. He had also given her $200.

 Anaaroo has bought new clothes with the money. ?If I live, I would like to meet him again,? she says.

 Public frenzy and a raging fever ensured that the only living member of the Musharraf household at Naharwali Haveli was unable to meet the Pakistan President?s mother Zarin, elder brother Javed and son Bilal when they visited it a month ago. As journalists and Daryaganj residents hijacked the family for their moment under the sun, Anaaroo was left behind.

 ?I was so angry. When his mother, brother and son came this time, I couldn?t meet them. I had a fever and I couldn?t go inside. There was such a big crowd. She came in a car and before we knew it, she had left,? says Anaaroo.

 It has been 10 years since Anaaroo retired from her job as a sweeper with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi but her childhood ties with Naharwali Haveli are still a big part of her life. Everyday, she walks about two kilometres from her house in the quarters behind Ferozeshah Kotla stadium to Daryaganj where she babysits her grandchildren.

 ?He is going to be at Kotla to watch the match,? she says, aware that one of the VIPs at the stadium on April 17, when India and Pakistan face off for the final one-dayer, will be her former ward.

 When he met Anaaroo in Delhi before heading to Agra on the peace mission, Musharraf had asked for her blessings. ?He hugged me and said ?Mummy, sir pe haat dharo. Aman ki dua kabool ho?,? Anaaroo says. ?I had prayed that his mission would be successful. Lekin, Agra main toh ladai ho gayi. I didn?t meet him after that. What could I ask him??

 It is clear that Anaaroo is keeping up with the news of Musharraf?s family. Referring to his new grandson, she has a new blessing to offer. ?I want to tell him that he had a grandson and he did not tell me. Meri dua hai ki tumhara beta badshah nahin bana lekin tumhara pota badshah banega,? she says. ?This time it will come true.?

 Pat amp; prod on Iran

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Washington is confident that Delhi, which had voted with it against Irans controversial nuclear programme, will not buckle under Left pressure and change its stand.

 The Left wants the government to reverse the vote when the issue is finally decided on November 24.

 India had taken into consideration its national interest while voting on the issue in Vienna in September. I am sure if it again comes to (a) vote, India will yet again take its national interest into consideration before voting, US ambassador David Mulford said today.

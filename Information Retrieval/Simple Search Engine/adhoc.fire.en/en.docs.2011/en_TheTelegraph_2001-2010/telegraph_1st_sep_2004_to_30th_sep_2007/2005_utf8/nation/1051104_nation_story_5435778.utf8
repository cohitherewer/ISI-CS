 Selloff sweetener fund

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Chidambaram

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The government is pressing its Left allies to agree to a faster pace of PSU selloff, arguing that the money is desperately needed to fund social welfare schemes.

 The cabinet today underlined its desperation to garner funds by implementing an old proposal to set up the National Investment Fund, a state-run facility where money earned from divestment will be parked.

 The proposal had been made in the budget presented by finance minister P. Chidambaram early this year. 

 The government today said about 75 per cent of the money in the fund will be spent on social sector projects in education, health and employment while another 25 per cent will be spent on reviving sick PSUs.

 The governments bid to push through the fund is aimed at getting the Left on its side on selloff.

 But the Left is not biting the bait yet.

 They (the government) have been trying to sell the idea that disinvestment needs to be pushed to fund off-budget social sector schemes for some time, but we feel that a comprehensive look has to be taken at the whole issue of resource mobilisation, said CPM leader Nilotpal Basu. 

 We are not against selling off stakes in PSUs, but we have to know which company, when and why. One has to be cautious about selling ones family silver. And certainly we are against this idea that the silver in our cupboard has to be sold off simply because Mr Chidambaram could not balance his books, said Abani Roy, RSP leader and a member of the Left-UPA coordination committee. 

 Roy feels that social projects should be funded from the budget. Even if funded from off-budget sources like the fund, there should be no pressure to sell government holdings or attempt to link the two up, he added. 

 The cash from the Maruti sale stake will be the first to be parked in the fund. An 8 per cent stake selloff to financial institutions and banks, already cleared by the cabinet, is expected to fetch about Rs 1,000 crore.

 The disinvestment programme had been put on hold for the last few months after a row between the Congress party and its Left allies. In fact, officials say the Maruti sale was chosen carefully so as not to offend the Left.

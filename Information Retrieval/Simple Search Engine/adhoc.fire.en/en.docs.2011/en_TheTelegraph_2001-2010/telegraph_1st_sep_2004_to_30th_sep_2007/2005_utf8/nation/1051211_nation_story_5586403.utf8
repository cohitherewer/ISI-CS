 Munda springs conversion ban

 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA

 Ranchi, Dec. 10: Jharkhand is likely to become the first BJP-ruled state to have a legislation against forcible religious conversion. 

 The announcement was made this afternoon by chief minister Arjun Munda at an Akhil Bharatiya Sashakta Adivasi Rally at the Morabadi Grounds here. 

 BJP president L.K. Advani, former president M. Venkaiah Naidu, Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh, all but two of the partys 19 tribal MPs and representatives from other BJP-ruled states were in attendance. 

 Advani supported the idea, saying this was essential in the current scenario. Much hue and cry was raised when we introduced the Go Raksha (cow protection) Bill. But the Supreme Court, too, finally upheld the decision. In fact, the Centre should pass a bill banning religious conversions in the entire country. But as the present government at the Centre is not interested, Jharkhands bold initiatives are welcome, he said.

 The only Christian minister in the Jharkhand government, Anosh Ekka, was not aware of the announcement and did not attend the rally. 

 A surprised Ekka said the issue had neither been taken up by the cabinet nor had the chief minister discussed it with him. 

 But the minister appeared unruffled and said the legislation would be meaningless because conversions are rarely, if ever, forced. Even a section within the BJP appeared to share that feeling. 

 Church leaders in the state claimed that they did not have figures of conversions but the number was unlikely to exceed 20 during the last 10 years. 

 The church, they said, was facing a severe shortage of priests and was finding it extremely difficult to even man the existing churches and parishes. Where is the manpower required to preach and convert people? they asked. 

 Cardinal Telesphore Toppo, when contacted, refused to comment. I would not like to comment on what has been said today; only God knows how much truth is there in what has been said at the rally.

 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the RSS said they did not have an exact idea of the number of conversions carried out in the state by Christian missionaries. But VHP leader Virendra Vimal welcomed the impending legislation.

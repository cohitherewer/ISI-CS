 FDI protest meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Left was today left with few options other than to stage token protests ?inside and outside Parliament? after the telecom FDI hike.

 ?We register our strong protest against the Union cabinet?s decision to hike FDI from 49 to 74 per cent in the telecom sector,? said CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury.

 He added that the four Left parties ? supporting the United Progressive Alliance government from outside ? will meet tomorrow at the CPM headquarters to decide on a strategy.

 The Left, however, cannot take any drastic political step that could threaten the government?s survival since it would mean giving the BJP a handle. 

 Left leaders conceded as much in private.

 But this does not mean the Left will publicly abandon its aggressive stand. From all indications, the government and the Left will continue to exchange notes and counter-notes on the issue. 

 ?We had submitted to the government a note detailing our opposition. The government responded with a note. We gave our response to the government?s note. The cabinet decision unfortunately came when the discussion was still going on,? Yechury said.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said he had taken the Left into confidence before deciding the policy.

 The CPI seems to have taken a milder view. The party, too, is maintaining its opposition in public, though, in private, it says the government had responded to the Left?s main concern of national security.

 Raaz back

 Mumbai, Feb. 23 (PTI): Actor Vijay Raaz, who arrived here today after detention in Dubai on charges of drug possession, claimed he was innocent and a urine examination by police in the Emirates had tested him negative for drugs. 

 ?Charges against me were withdrawn,? he said. Admitting that around six grams of ganja had been found in his bag, Raaz maintained: ?The police recovered the drugs from my bag, but I have no clue as to how they landed there.?

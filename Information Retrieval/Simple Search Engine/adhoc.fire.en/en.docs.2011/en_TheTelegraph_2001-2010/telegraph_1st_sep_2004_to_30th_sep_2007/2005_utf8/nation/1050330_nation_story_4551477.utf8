 Free meal on Kashmir first bus 

 Islamabad, March 29 (PTI): Passengers of the inaugural bus between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar will be given free tickets and meal by the Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir government.

 Prime Minister of PoK Sikandar Hayat Khan, who will flag off the bus from Muzaffarabad on April 7, made the announcement today. He said his government would provide the same facilities to the passengers of the first bus coming to Muzaffarabad from Srinagar.

 ?I myself will welcome the passengers coming from Srinagar,? he told the Voice of America radio in an interview. The first bus would carry 30 passengers from each side.

 Hayat said all arrangements, like repair of road and construction of the bus terminal at this side of the Line of Control, have been completed.

 Replying to a question, he said the bus service could be a first step towards the resolution of the Kashmir issue. However, he said no solution could prove durable without the inclusion of the people of Kashmir in the process.

 Officials said hectic arrangements were being made to keep the infrastructure ready to run the bus service as scheduled.

 While the road, which has not been used since 1947, and the surrounding areas have been de-mined, work was being carried out at rapid pace to construct shelters for the passengers.

 Pakistan has issued over 2,500 application forms for special permits to travel by the bus, which would be run on a fortnightly basis.

 In Srinagar, Congress president Sonia Gandhi will share the pole position with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, flagging off the inaugural bus. 

 Sonia will also address a public rally along with Singh and chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in Srinagar before the flag-off.

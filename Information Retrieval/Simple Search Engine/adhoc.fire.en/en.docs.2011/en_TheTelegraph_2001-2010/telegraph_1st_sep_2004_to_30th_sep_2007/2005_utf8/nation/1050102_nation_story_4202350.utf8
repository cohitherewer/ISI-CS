 New Delhi, Jan. 1: Children are the worst-hit victims of Sunday?s tsunami strike and more have died in this natural disaster than in the Bhuj earthquake and the Orissa supercyclone, say aid workers.

 Thousands of children have lost one or both parents; adolescents who used to be in schools barely a week ago are now looking for jobs to take care of their younger siblings, the workers added.

 ?Reports indicate that children were the worst affected by the tsunami, either because they did not have the strength to cope with the (wall of) water or because they lost relatives and homes,? says Anshu Sharma of Seeds, a voluntary organisation now engaged in rehabilitation in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 Children, in the aftermath of disasters, are at the greatest risk of economic, physical and sexual abuse, the aid workers said.

 For now, a large number of the children have a roof over their heads as voluntary organisations have begun rehabilitation, but the road ahead is uncertain.

 ?It is very difficult to keep track of the survivors and what happens to them later,? Sharma explained. He cites his organisation?s experience of the aftermath of the 1999 supercyclone.

 It hit an estimated 3.3 million children, a quarter of the affected population of Orissa; 1,500 were orphaned. Aid workers say that five years later, they do not have enough information about what happened to a large number of these children.

 ?We had reports about women and children being trafficked in the aftermath of the Orissa cyclone,? Sharma said.

 The number of children affected by the tsunami strike is much larger and tracking them down will be even more difficult, the aid workers said. They fear many of these children will become ?invisible? once the media glare abates.

 ?This morning, I met at least 10 children who have lost their parents. The eldest among them is 16 years old. She asked me whether I can give her a job. She used to study in the 10th standard. But now, she has to look after three younger siblings,? said Victor Painadath, deputy director of the Indian chapter of SOS children?s village, on Friday.

 He is setting up day-care centres for children in Tamil Nadu?s worst-hit Nagapattinam district. Painadath also cited the case of a one-and-a-half-year-old girl who lost her father. ?Her mother died earlier.?

 Voluntary organisations are putting together make-shift day-care centres for the children.

 ?One of the major aspects of care relates to their trauma. We try to keep the children occupied, either by telling them stories or engage them in music and drawing,? said Pradip Singh, national director of SOS, a voluntary organisation working with children.

 The Orissa experience, according to aid workers, emphasised the precarious condition of orphans. ?In Orissa, issues relating to care of orphans, unaccompanied children and children of single parents turned out to be highly controversial,? said Christian Aid, a voluntary organisation.

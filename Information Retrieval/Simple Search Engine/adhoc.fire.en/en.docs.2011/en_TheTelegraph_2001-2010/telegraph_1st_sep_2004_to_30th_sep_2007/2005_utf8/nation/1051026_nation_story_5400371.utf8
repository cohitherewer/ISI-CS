 Student swoop on Varanasi brothels

 Lucknow: Benaras Hindu University students and NGO workers rescued 31 minors from a red-light area in Varanasi on Tuesday, reports our special correspondent.

 Around 5 pm, about 20 BHU students and workers Gudia raided the brothels in Madhuadihi and rescued them. 

 The girls were taken into custody later in the evening and police have drawn up an FIR against unidentified accused for engaging the minors in the flesh trade. 

 Varanasi SSP Navneet Sikera said the police were trying to find out from where the girls have come. It appeared they were mostly from districts of Mirzapur, Mau and Gazipur, he said.

 The recovery of the 31 girls from brothels has exposed the underbelly of Varanasi, said Ranjana Vajpayee, the chairperson of the state womens commission. When the police and the district administration go on a long slumber, this kind of exploitative machinery becomes active in employing minor girls in the flesh trade, said Girija Vyas, the National Womens Commission chairperson.

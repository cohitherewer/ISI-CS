 Plea to ease mike ban for Navratri

 New Delhi (PTI): The Gujarat government has moved the Supreme Court seeking to relax the ban on the use of loudspeakers for Navratri. The use of loudspeakers has been restricted from 10 pm to 6 am across the country.

 The court has posted the matter for hearing on Monday. 

 Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Gujarat government, sought a two-hour relaxation from 10 pm till midnight during Navratri for the popular garba dance.

 A 2002 amendment to the Noise Pollution (Control and Regulation) Rules, 2000, permits state governments to relax the condition for use of loudspeakers at night for two hours during cultural and festive occasions of a limited duration, Rohatgi said.

 The court, however, expressed unhappiness as several states had been seeking a relaxation of the ban for different festivals.

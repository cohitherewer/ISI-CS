 Rohtak seat buzz for PM

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, May 10: Rohtak may be where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could contest from if the Congress opts to bring him to the Lok Sabha.

 There is speculation in Congress circles that the leadership under Sonia Gandhi is thinking of bringing Singh to the Lower House from the Haryana constituency. Sources claimed that such talks have gained currency even at the higher levels.

 ?If the Prime Minister enters the Lok Sabha, it will strengthen his position. It would also help the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance send out a strong political message,? a source said.

 Singh has been a member of the Rajya Sabha ever since he started his political career as finance minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government in 1991. He still has three years left in his third term as Rajya Sabha member from Assam.

 Generally, the Prime Minister is a member of the Lok Sabha, though there were exceptions. For a brief while after becoming Prime Minister in 1966, Indira Gandhi was a member of the Rajya Sabha. The two United Front Prime Ministers ? H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral ? were also from the Upper House.

 Rohtak is now represented in the Lower House by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who became Haryana chief minister in March.

 Although Hooda has not yet vacated the Lok Sabha seat, he will do so next month to contest from the Kiloi Assembly segment of his parliamentary constituency in the June 2 bypolls, announced recently by the Election Commission.

 Sri Kishan, who was elected from Kiloi in the Assembly polls two months ago, resigned last month to make way for the chief minister.

 Hooda, who was in the capital yesterday, is believed to be enthusiastic about Singh contesting from Rohtak. However, it was not clear whether he broached the topic with the leadership.

 Sonia would be in Haryana on May 14 to address a rally in Jind, a town near Rohtak, to ?thank? voters and celebrate her partys thumping victory in the Assembly elections.

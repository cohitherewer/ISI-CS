 Cong seeks Mehbooba as No. 2

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Mehbooba Mufti

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: When Ghulam Nabi Azad sits on the chief ministers chair in Jammu and Kashmir next week, the Congress wants Mehbooba Mufti to be his deputy.

 Sonia Gandhi is learnt to have suggested to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that it consider nominating Mehbooba, its president and daughter of outgoing chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, for the job.

 The party believes that having a Congress head of government from Jammu and a Valley-based number two from the PDP will give the new ministry both stability and a representative character.

 Though PDP leaders have assured full support and co-operation to the new ministry, the Congress is aware that the coalition partner isnt too happy about the changeover, agreed between them in October 2002.

 In Srinagar, outgoing finance minister and prominent PDP leader Muzaffar Baig expressed surprise today over Sonias decision to appoint Azad in Muftis place.

 Congress general secretary Ambika Soni said that with a swap of the chief ministers chair, the deputy chief ministers slot, held by the Congresss Mangat Ram Sharma for the last three years, will now go to the alliance partner.

 She said her party expects the PDP to accept the post, and added that the allies will also swap most of the portfolios.

 But Congress leaders would not go public with their preference for Mehbooba. It is for the PDP leadership to decide, Soni said.

 A few weeks ago, the Congress leadership had suggested to Mufti that he join the Manmohan Singh government as a cabinet minister. The idea apparently was that Mufti would take his daughters place in the Lok Sabha while she assumed his seat in the state legislature.

 In Srinagar, the PDP leadership put off a decision till Monday, when its legislature party is due to meet.

 Though the Congress wants Mehbooba as Azads deputy, she may not be inclined to play second fiddle. Baigs name is being mentioned prominently for the deputy chief ministers post, provided the PDP decides to accept it.

 The Congress legislature party will meet in Srinagar on Sunday to formally elect Azad as its leader.

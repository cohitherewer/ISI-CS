 Cop killed 

 Hyderabad, March 18: Maoists today killed a 32-year-old police constable, Prakash, setting his colleagues on the warpath over the indecisiveness of the Andhra Pradesh government on the rebels, reports our special correspondent.

 The policemen of Mahboobnagar district staged a demonstration at Balanagar town and stalled the post-mortem and funeral rites of their colleague, demanding that civil rights activists P. Varavara Rao, Gaddar and G. Kalyan Rao ? emissaries of the rebels ? be immediately arrested.

 Four rebels opened fire on the constable when he was returning from the mandal revenue office, sources said.

 This is the second incident this week in which police personnel have been killed. On Wednesday, Maoists had butchered three policemen on highway patrol duty in Nalgonda district.

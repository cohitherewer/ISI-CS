 Fodder judge in age row

 Laloo: New twist

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The trial judge now handling the fodder scam cases against Laloo Prasad Yadav and his wife Rabri Devi is supposed to have retired this January.

 The annual confidential report (ACR) on Munni Lal Paswan mentions his date of retirement as 31-01-2005.

 The Supreme Court had last week asked Patna High Court for the report and details on the transfers/promotions of four earlier trial judges on a PIL that alleged Laloo Prasad was misusing his political clout to water down the cases.

 According to the ACR, Paswan should have already retired but law ministry sources said it was up to the high court ? which has administrative jurisdiction over the district judiciary ? to explain matters to the Supreme Court.

 A bench presided over by Justice S.N. Variava had last week sought the details on a PIL by Sushil Modi of the BJP and Rajiv Ranjan Lallan of the Janata Dal (United). He had also made it clear that after his retirement on November 6, some other judge would take over.

 The ACR on Paswan says his knowledge of law and procedure is average but he is industrious. As an officer of average merit ? he should exert more to increase his out-turn, it says.

 It is also believed to have had some adverse remarks recorded against him regarding low disposal of cases, but they have been expunged by the high court.

 The PIL alleged Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi kept transferring trial judges on the pretext of giving them promotion. But their intention was to slow down the due process of law and they were using extra-constitutional methods, it claimed.

 The Supreme Court has also called for records relating to income-tax cases against the couple and the clean chit given by the IT tribunal, Patna.

 The report of the Central Administrative Tribunal has been sent to the registrar-general of Patna High Court. It is expected to collect and collate information and submit it to the Supreme Court when it hears the case next week.

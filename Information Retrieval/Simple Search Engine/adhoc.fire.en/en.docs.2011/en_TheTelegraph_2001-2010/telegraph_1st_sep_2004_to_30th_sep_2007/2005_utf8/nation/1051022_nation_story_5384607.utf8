 Onion ghost returns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 21: Onion prices have shot up in Maharashtra ? the state where the bulk of the crop is produced ? bringing back memories of the 1998 crisis that toppled several state governments.

 Onion prices climbed up from Rs 6-10 a kg in 2004 to Rs 14-18 a kg this monsoon and now hover around Rs 20-24 per kg. 

 Wholesalers at the Vashi vegetable market in Navi Mumbai blamed the floods for the destruction of the onion crop in places like Nashik, Kolhapur and Dhulia. 

 As the BJP stepped up the heat on the government, a delegation led by Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray today met chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and demanded immediate measures to stem the price rise. Former Speaker Manohar Joshi, MPs Anant Geete and Anand Adsool and legislator Kanhaiyyalal Gidwani were part of the team.

 We met Deshmukh regarding the sugarcane issue, but also warned him that if the government does not take emergency steps to bring down the prices, they might spiral out of control. The chief minister assured us that he has convened a meeting to find a solution on October 25, but I feel it may be too late, Gidwani said.

 According to him, the Democratic Front government had last month announced that it would steady the price at Rs 13 a kg and make more stocks available, but did nothing.

 Maharashtra has excluded onions from the Essential Commodities Act, and hence no restrictions can be imposed on stocking of onions. It is true that the onion crop was affected this year, but the current shortage is an artificial shortage created by certain vested interests.

 The Deshmukh government has spoken about importing onion from Pakistan to meet the shortage. But Union agricultural minister Sharad Pawar made it clear today that the Centre did not favour the move.

 It is not economically feasible to import from Pakistan. If the shortage in Maharashtra continues for two weeks more, we will ask Karnataka and other states to supply onions, he said in Pune.

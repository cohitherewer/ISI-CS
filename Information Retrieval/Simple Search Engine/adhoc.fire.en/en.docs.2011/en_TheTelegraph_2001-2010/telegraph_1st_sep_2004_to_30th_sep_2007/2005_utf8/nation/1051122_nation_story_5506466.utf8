 Uma up for talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: Uma Bharti is flexing her muscles and a wary BJP has fixed up a meeting this week to discuss her future and other issues.

 But as BJP president L.K. Advani is on his way out, a final decision on Umas future and who replaces Babulal Gaur as chief minister in Madhya Pradesh may still be put off.

 Having campaigned extensively in Bihar, Uma had been led to believe her re-induction in the party was imminent. Advani is believed to be sympathetic to her cause though she attacked him in full view of television cameras.

 A scenario in which she gets inducted as a general secretary in the central party and her bete noire Shivraj Singh Chauhan is installed as chief minister was also being discussed.

 But the scenario has changed of late. While several names ?Sumitra Mahajan, Gauri Shankar Shejwar, Shivraj Singh Chauhan ? are doing the rounds, party insiders believe a final decision looks less likely now.

 The general secretaries meeting on Thursday may just be a way of keeping Uma quiet till a new president takes over the BJP. 

 Uma had, while campaigning in Bihar, said she would discuss the chief ministership issue decisively after the polls got over. Having done her bit in the state, she was obviously not going to let the central leadership ignore her.

 She summoned her supporter MLAs and five ministers in the Madhya Pradesh cabinet on Friday. But she did not parade them before Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani as expected.

 Her supporters claimed she kept quiet because she had been assured the issue would be settled in her favour at the Thursday meeting. But her detractors said she had not been able to muster enough strength to put up an impressive show before the leaders.

 Senior leaders said all possible alternatives were being discussed.

 Every MLA is a potential CM. The only certainty in MP is the removal of Babulal Gaur.? But some people tend to survive longer than they should either because there is no alternative or there are too many to choose from, a senior leader said.

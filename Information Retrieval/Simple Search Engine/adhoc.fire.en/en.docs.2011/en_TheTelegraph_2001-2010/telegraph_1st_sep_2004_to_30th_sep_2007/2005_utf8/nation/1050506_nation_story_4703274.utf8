 E-tender to keep mafia at bay

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 5: The Orissa government will soon start e-tendering its contracts to circumvent the mafia.

 A recent meeting of the secretaries of the rural development, urban development, works and water resources departments decided to send officials of the Orissa Computer Application Centre (Ocac) and the government to Andhra Pradesh for learning more about the process.

 On April 18, five gangsters gunned down two contractors in front of the office of the executive engineer, water resources department, in the Unit-8 area of the capital. Dispute over a tender was believed one of the motives behind the murder.

 The meeting chaired by chief secretary Subash Pani decided that the departments concerned will float tenders on their respective websites while Ocac will provide the required technical inputs.

 Pani, who is known to be a tech-savvy person, said e-tendering will remove the impediments associated with the traditional procurement process, besides saving time and money. ?It will eliminate the interference of the mafia to a large extent,? he added.

 A senior government official said there are three stages of mafia interference in the tendering process, with the water resources and works departments being the worst affected.

 The first stage is where the mafia members physically prevent other bidders from even submitting their applications. In the next stage ? when contracts are awarded ? they attack the winning bidder. Finally, the mafia disrupt the implementation of the project. 

 ?For the time being, we hope the mafia will not bid for government projects on the Net,? the official said.

 To prevent the leak of quoted rates, Ocac officials will have to ensure that the encryption system is foolproof, he added.

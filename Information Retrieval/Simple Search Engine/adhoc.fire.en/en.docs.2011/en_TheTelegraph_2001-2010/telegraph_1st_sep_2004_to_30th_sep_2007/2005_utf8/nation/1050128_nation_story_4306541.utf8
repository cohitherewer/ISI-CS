 Kher quits NSD

 Mumbai, Jan. 27 (PTI): Actor and former censor board chief Anupam Kher has resigned as chairman of Delhi?s National School of Drama.

 ?I have decided to launch my own acting school. So, I thought it would be unethical and inappropriate of me to continue as the chairman of the institution. I have hence tendered my resignation on moral grounds?, Kher said today.

 He said his school, Actor Prepares, which will be launched here on February 2, will offer a three-month course in acting. ?It is not going to be the swimming and horse riding teaching kind of school because I think both have little to do with acting.?

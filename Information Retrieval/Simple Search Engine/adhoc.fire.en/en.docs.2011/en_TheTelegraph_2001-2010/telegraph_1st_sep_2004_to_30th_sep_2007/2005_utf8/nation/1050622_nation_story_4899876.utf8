 Godhra poser for Centre

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, June 21: The Centre is in a bind with the Left pushing for the transfer of Godhra cases outside Gujarat and the state refusing to withdraw terror charges against the 131 accused in the train carnage despite recommendations of a review panel.

 The anti-terror law review panel has said the burning of the Sabarmati Express did happen on the date, time and place alleged by the prosecution, but certainly was not as a part of conspiracy envisaged under the provisions of Pota.

 The accused, therefore, cannot be tried under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002, it said. However, they may be tried under the Indian Penal Code, Indian Railways Act, Prevention of Damages of Public Property Act and the Bombay Police Act, according to the panel.

 The CPM, in particular, asked the Congress-led government ? at a recent Left-UPA co-ordination committee meeting ? to exercise its constitutional powers.

 The party said Sections 23, 28 and 35 of the anti-terror law empowers the Centre to constitute a special court. In the case of Gujarat, this would mean shifting the present court from Sabarmati, Ahmedabad. It also gives the Centre the power to transfer the cases to another judge and change the public prosecutor. 

 A source said Union home minister Shivraj Patil had at the last minute backtracked from giving his nod to transfering the cases and asking for a probe by the CBI.

 The ministry wants to tread cautiously and wants to know the legal and political fallout if it takes such a position. The home minister does not want to act in haste given the sensitive nature of the subject where there are chances of being branded, the source said.

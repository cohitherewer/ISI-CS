 Arrest alert on Natwar plate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: India will propose to Pakistan wide-ranging amendments in bilateral visa and consular services that will allow the neighbours to exchange a list of prisoners twice every year and notify the arrest of each others nationals.

 The cabinet committee on security chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today gave the foreign ministry the green signal to propose the amendments to Pakistan. There may also be a proposal for easy travel for Indian and Pakistani nationals for pilgrimage and medical treatment to each others country.

 The proposed amendment to the 1974 and 1982 agreements aims at a mechanism where the two sides will exchange a list of prisoners in each others jails in January and July every year.

 It also talks about one country notifying the second when one of the second countrys nationals gets arrested in the first. It is also being suggested the two sides must give consular access to the other within three months.

 There is also a move to revive the joint commission between the two countries after 16 years. The commission, which deals with trade and economic issues among others, can lead to the setting up of the State Bank of India in Pakistan and the Pakistani national bank, Habib Bank, in India.

 The proposals were approved on the eve of foreign minister Natwar Singhs visit to Pakistan. Singh leaves for Islamabad on Sunday and will hold discussions with Pakistan counterpart Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri and senior Pakistani officials. He may call on Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf.

 Natwar is also likely to sign two agreements: one on pre-notification of ballistic missile tests and another on a communication network between the Indian Coast Guard and the Maritime Security Agency of Pakistan.

 The visit, ostensibly to review progress in the composite dialogue, is being seen as an attempt for a rapprochement with Pakistan. The meeting between Manmohan Singh and Musharraf in New York earlier this month did not go off well.

 Indian officials said they were willing to show flexibility on redeployment of troops in Siachen, provided it rested on an agreed verification mechanism to authenticate the actual ground position of the soldiers. There are indications Delhi is willing to look at ways to resolve the Sir Creek dispute.

 There will, however, be no compromise on troop withdrawal from Jammu and Kashmir. Officials said this was a sovereign decision of the Indian government and Delhi would not entertain any suggestion from outsiders.

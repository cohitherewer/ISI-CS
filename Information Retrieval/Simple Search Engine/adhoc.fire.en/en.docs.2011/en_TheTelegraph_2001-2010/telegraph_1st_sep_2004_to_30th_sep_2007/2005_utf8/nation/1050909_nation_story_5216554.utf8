 Laloo honesty salvo at Ram Vilas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Paswan

New Delhi, Sept. 8: Ram Vilas Paswan should quit the UPA government at the Centre if he splits secular forces by not joining the alliance in Bihar for the coming state polls, Laloo Prasad Yadav said today.

 Honesty demands that he should quit the UPA at the Centre if he does not join us to strengthen secular forces in Bihar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief said as he emerged from a meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi at her 10 Janpath residence.

 The railway ministers tough talk is significant as his discussions with Sonia came in the immediate backdrop of the Lok Janshakti Party leaders plan to float a third front with the CPI and the CPI (ML).

 Laloo Prasad said he was not pursuing any agenda to throw Paswan out of the central coalition and still expects the LJP chief to see reason and give up his plans to oppose the RJD-led UPA in Bihar. But we will not touch his (Paswan) feet to bring him on board the UPA in Bihar, he asserted.

 Nor would the RJD, Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and the CPM ? parties that now constitute the Bihar UPA ? would wait indefinitely for the LJP and the CPI to join them. As the Election Commission has already started the poll process, the two parties would have to make up their mind immediately, Laloo Prasad added.

 While Laloo Prasad targeted Paswan, the Congress came down heavily on the CPI for making common cause with the LJP chief.

 AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh asked CPI leader A.B. Bardhan to consider whether his partys stand was not effectively helping the BJP and the Janata Dal (United).

 Referring to the CPI secretarys charge that the Congress was forcing a crack in the central coalition by issuing an ultimatum to Paswan to join the UPA in Bihar, Singh said: Instead of firing at us, Bardhan should target his gun at the NDA.

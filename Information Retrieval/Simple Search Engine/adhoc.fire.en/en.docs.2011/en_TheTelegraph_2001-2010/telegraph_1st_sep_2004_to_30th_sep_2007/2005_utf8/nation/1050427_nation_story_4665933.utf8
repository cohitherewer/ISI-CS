 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 26: Suspected Communist Party of India (Maoist) activists last night blew up a police outpost in Seshkhal village under Ramanaguda police station of Rayagada district.

 A group of eight Maoists asked the two policemen present there to come out and then used an explosive to blow up the outpost, Rayagada superintendent of police Sanjay Kumar said. There was no report of any casualty or injury.

 A telephone handset kept in the outpost was seen hanging from a nearby coconut tree after the blast. This is the third Naxalite attack in the district in the past month. Police have seized a letter written in Telugu from the spot.

 A camp of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is located about 5 km from the spot where the explosion took place. Sources said a joint team of CRPF and Orissa police later retaliated and an exchange of fire was on till reports last came in.

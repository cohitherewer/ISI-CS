 PoK ok, not Pak: Delhi to Hurriyat

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, May 26: As the five-member Hurriyat delegation led by Mirwaiz Omar Farooq prepares to board the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus on June 2 following the invite from Pakistan, the Indian government appears wary of the fallout of the visit.

 Sources in the home ministry said though the consolidation of different factions of the separatist conglomerate is a cause of worry, it also sees a silver lining on Kashmirs horizon. 

 The government, they said, is keen to establish direct contact with Hizb-ul Mujahideen leader Syed Salahuddin, the most important key to the Kashmir problem among the militant outfits.

 The sources said the government hopes the beginning of this process could even prod him to call India for talks for lasting peace. 

 A lot depends on what brief they get from the Pakistani authorities, said an official.

 Home secretary V.K. Duggal today said the Centre will not be a stumbling block in the Hurriyats way but procedures should be followed. If their visit is purposeful and useful for us we have no objections, he added.

 According to the sources, he was referring to the governments stand that the Hurriyat leaders should board the bus not as a delegation but as individuals.

 Asked if the government wants Salahuddin to come to India for talks, Duggal told The Telegraph that the Centres doors were open and it would talk to anybody who could help find lasting peace in Kashmir.

 However, a PTI report said Salahuddin has opposed the decision of the moderate faction of the Hurriyat and the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front to travel to Pakistan, saying it would be more detrimental to the separatist cause. 

 Salahuddin was obviously favouring the visit by hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani who has not yet accepted Pakistans invitation to travel to that country, says PTI.

 Besides the Mirwaiz, the other members of the delegation are executive committee members Abdul Gani Bhat, Maulana Abbas Ansari, Bilal Gani Lone and Fazal Haq Qureshi.

 Later, in a blow to the Hurriyat delegations plans to visit places other than Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said the government has a clear understanding with Pakistan that passengers travelling on this bus can travel only within the territory of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. 

 Any travel beyond the territory, he added, would not be in keeping with the understanding between the two governments.

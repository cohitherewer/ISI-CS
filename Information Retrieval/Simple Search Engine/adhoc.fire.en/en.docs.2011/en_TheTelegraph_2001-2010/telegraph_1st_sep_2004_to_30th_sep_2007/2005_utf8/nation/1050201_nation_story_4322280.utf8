 Stamp stains khaki

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: The CBI has filed three chargesheets against alleged stamp scam mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi that accuse two Delhi Police officers of not only letting him off the hook but also implicating the kingpin?s rivals in the racket.

 The CBI chargesheet said inspector Puran Singh ? then posted as head of Defence Colony police station ? seized fake stamp papers valued at Rs 12.97 crore from Mumbai in January 2001, ostensibly linked to one of Telgi?s rivals who had been arrested by the police officer.

 CBI investigations showed that the fake stamp papers were handed over to the police officer by Telgi to implicate Jai Kishan Singh alias Bengali. 

 A Telgi associate, Shiv Shankar Singh, was produced as a witness to say that the suitcase full of fake stamps belonged to Bengali, the chargesheet said.

 The chargesheets against Telgi, his associates and the police officers were filed in the court of designated CBI Judge H.P. Sharma.

 The first chargesheet deals with an alleged conspiracy among Telgi, inspector Puran Singh, sub-inspector Gaurav Aggarwal, head constable Om Prakash and constables Sanjay Bajad and Ratan Singh during 1999 - 2001.

 Puran Singh, who then was probing a case of fake stamps registered at Defence Colony police station in south Delhi, has been accused of taking huge bribes from Telgi.

 ?Puran Singh knowingly and deliberately kept Telgi out of the purview of investigation,? the chargesheet said.

 Telgi is alleged to have supplied fake stamps to a lab through a front company, Unique Consultants, which was not probed by Puran Singh, the chargesheet said.

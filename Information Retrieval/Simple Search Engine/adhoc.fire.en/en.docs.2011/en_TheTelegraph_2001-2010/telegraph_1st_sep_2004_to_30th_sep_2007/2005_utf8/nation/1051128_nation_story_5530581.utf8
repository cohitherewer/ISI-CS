 Judeo charges lined up

 New Delhi, Nov. 27 (PTI): After a probe into the cash-on-camera scam, purportedly involving former Union minister Dilip Singh Judeo, the CBI is set to file a chargesheet against him and Bhupinder Singh.

 The CBI, which registered a regular case against the former minister, his personal secretary Natwar Rateria and Bhupinder alias Rahul, had probed the case for nearly two years. Bhupinder is said to have handed Judeo Rs 9 lakh in cash in a Delhi hotel, which was captured on video.

 CBI sources said all the evidence was considered by the agency which secured sanction for prosecution against Judeo from the home ministry as he was then the Union minister for environment and forests.

 However, the sources said the fourth accused in the FIR ? Arvind Vijay Mohan, an art dealer who provided the logistics for the secret video recording ? had been exempted from being chargesheeted because of difference of opinion within the CBI.

 The chargesheet is likely to be filed soon, the sources said.

 The agency also decided not to file a chargesheet against Amit Jogi, though the CBI had submitted before the Supreme Court that the motive behind the cash-on-camera expose was to derive political mileage in favour of his father Ajit Jogi ahead of the Chhattisgarh elections. 

 The CBI, in an affidavit in response to a petition by Bhupinder seeking to quash the case against him, said during/around July 2003, Amit Jogi, son of Ajit Jogi, then chief minister of Chhattisgarh, hatched a plan with Rajat Prasad, Arvind Vijay Mohan and the petitioner, to video record Dilip Singh Judeo, in the act of receiving the bribe.

 However, when it came to filing a chargesheet against Amit, the CBI decided against it as there was no substantial evidence against him.

 The CBI had booked Judeo, Bhupinder, Rateria and Mohan under Section 7 (public servant taking bribe other than legal remuneration), Section 12 (abetment of the offence under Section 7, Section 13 (2) read with Section 13 (i)(d) (criminal misconduct by a public servant) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 120-b (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.

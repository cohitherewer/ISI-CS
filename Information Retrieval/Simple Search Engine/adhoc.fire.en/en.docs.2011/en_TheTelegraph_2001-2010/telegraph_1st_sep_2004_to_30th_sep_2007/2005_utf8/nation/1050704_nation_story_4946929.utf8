 Bullied, boy poisons school meal 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, July 3: Bullied by classmates, an 11-year-old boy took revenge by pouring pesticide into a cauldron of dal at his school hostel.

 The result: Two dead and five seriously ill with 28 others needing treatment for stomach pain and vomiting.

 The Class VII student, who drew attention to himself by skipping the meal and becoming the only one among the 36 boarders not to fall ill, was arrested yesterday. He has confessed, police said.

 On June 23, students of Singharmunda Mission School in Badgaon, about 40 km from Sundargarh town, complained of nausea and began throwing up soon after their usual lunch of rice and dal.

 All 35 who had eaten the meal were taken to the nearby primary health centre. Two of them died there and five others, whose condition kept getting worse, were shifted to a hospital in Sundargarh town. The rest were discharged. The five boys who were hospitalised have since recovered.

 The police initially suspected food poisoning, but the post-mortem report revealed that the dal contained the pesticide Thiamex.

 The usual suspects, such as the cook and the shopkeeper who had sold the dal, were questioned but no leads emerged ? till the police got interested in the lone boarder who had missed lunch that day.

 Though he normally eats his lunch with the other boarders, that day he had avoided the meal, said Sundargarh superintendent of police Y.K. Jethwa.

 The boy told the police that his classmates ? most of whom stayed at the hostel ? regularly bullied him and that he had been plotting revenge. 

 On June 22, he bought a can of pesticide from a local fertiliser shop. The next morning, he stole into the hostel kitchen and bided his time.

 As the cook stepped out to fetch something, he emptied the can in the pot. The cook saw him come out of the kitchen but did not suspect anything.

 It was an easy case to crack. The boy admitted to his crime as soon as we confronted him, the police officer said.

 The police have lodged a case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code against the boy. He was today produced at a local juvenile court and granted bail under the Juvenile Justice Act.

 After buying the pesticide, the boy had walked to his home, which is near the hostel, and spent the night there. Some neighbours who saw him with the can of pesticide had informed his father. But he did not act fast enough.

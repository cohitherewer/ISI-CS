 Red jab at Rabri for jail reprieve

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 25: The CPI (ML) today joined the protest against the release of controversial Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Mohammad Shahabuddin from Beur Central Jail on the orders of chief minister Rabri Devi and urged the Election Commission to immediately intervene in the matter.

 Shahabuddin is an accused in the murder of CPI(ML) worker Munna Chaudhary, a case in which Patna High Court granted him bail earlier this month, as well as in the killing of former JNU students? union president Chandrashekhar, who too was a CPI(ML) worker.

 The BJP has already petitioned the commission, requesting it to set aside the chief minister?s order that quashed the orders of Siwan district magistrate Chandra Kant Anil, who had booked Shahabuddin under the Bihar Control of Crime Act and restrained his release from the jail till February 28.

 Shahabuddin, who is now in Delhi apparently to attend the budget session of Parliament, has said he would go to ?any extent? to ensure that a government led by the RJD comes to office in Bihar.

 In its memorandum to the poll panel, the CPI(ML), which is said to be going strong in at least two of the eight seats in Siwan district, has appreciated the ?bold measures? taken by it, ?which include the shifting and externment of Shahabuddin?. ?In utter contempt of these decisions, the Bihar government has surprisingly, and in a huff, withdrawn the CCA (Control of Crime Act) against Shahabuddin, quashed his detention order and secured his release on February 24,? CPI(ML) secretary Ram Jatan Sharma said.

 ?With Shahabuddin at large, there is every chance that he will exercise his criminal and political clout to disturb the concluding part of the peaceful, free and fair election process,? he added.

 ?To check such disturbing elements from intervening in the process of free and fair elections, we request you to take cognisance of the blatant violation by the Bihar government in freeing Shahabuddin from jail,? Sharma said.

 ?We request you to take immediate and effective steps to restore the atmosphere of free and fair elections prevailing in Siwan and nearby districts where the absence of Shahabuddin has made a difference this time. also We request you to ensure that Shahabuddin remains behind bars at least till the election process, including the issue of certificates to the winning candidates by the returning officers, is complete,? the memorandum said.

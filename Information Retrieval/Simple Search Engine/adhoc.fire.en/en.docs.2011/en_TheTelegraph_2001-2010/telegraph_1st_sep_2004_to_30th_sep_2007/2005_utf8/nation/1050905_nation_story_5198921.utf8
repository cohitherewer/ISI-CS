 Raipur, Sept. 4: Naxalites struck in spectacular fashion yesterday, killing 23 policemen and a civilian in an explosion that tossed their anti-landmine vehicle 20 feet in the air and split it into two.

 The dead included 22 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), a constable from the district police and a village security officer.

 A 10-ft crater was left at the site, around 450 km south of Raipur in Dantewada district, bordering Andhra Pradesh, by the explosion that occurred around 6 pm.

 It was one of the most audacious strikes ever carried out anywhere in the country by Naxalites.

 Apart from the human casualty, the biggest shock for the administration was the damage caused to the anti-landmine vehicle, considered a key weapon in the fight against Maoist rebels.

 The government had procured about a dozen such vehicles from the Centre for anti-Maoist operations. The Centre had asked the state to test the quality of the vehicles made in Medak, Andhra Pradesh. 

 Police sources said 25 jawans of the 87th Battalion of the CRPF, a policeman from the district force and a village security officer had gone out patrolling last evening in the dense forests of Bijapur, considered a Naxalite hub. 

 As the anti-landmine vehicle they were travelling in approached a bridge near a village, about 11 km from Bijapur, a powerful landmine went off. 

 Twenty-two people died on the spot while two succumbed to injuries at the government hospital in Bijapur. There were only three survivors.

 Police and additional forces took time to reach the spot because of the difficult terrain. The possibility of an ambush during rescue operations was not ruled out, making the police extra-cautious, said sources. 

 It was not before 9 pm that a police team reached the spot. Till then, five jawans, including the two CRPF men who died later, were engaged in a gunbattle with the extremists. 

 D.K. Toppo, commandant of the CRPF and one of the survivors, said: The intention of the Maoists was to loot our arms and ammunition. But the fight the jawans put up with their limited resources foiled the Maoists attempts.

 The three survivors were admitted to the medical college hospital here this morning. The commandant was reportedly out of danger but the others were fighting for their lives. 

 Toppo recalled that the Maoist leaders instructed their cadets to surround the spot from all sides and did not seem to know that there were only five jawans fighting them.

 The Maoists thought that 12-15 people had survived and were giving them a tough fight, Toppo said, adding that this could have been the reason for the rebels retreat.

 Since the wireless sets were damaged, Toppo could not communicate the message to the police headquarters. It was the driver of a jeep plying on the route who informed the Bijapur police. By the time the additional forces arrived, the rebels had fled.

 Snub fuels rush for Russia visa deal

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: India and Russia are working on the finer points of the first visa agreement between the two so that it could be sealed in December, a senior government official has said. 

 The need for such an agreement was felt after Delhi was left red-faced when Moscow recently denied visas to three Indian industrialists ? Anil Ambani, Anand Mahindra and Sunil Bharti Mittal ? officials said.

 No visa agreement existed earlier probably because of the exceedingly good relations between the two countries since the time of the erstwhile Soviet Union. 

 Kanwal Sibal, the Indian ambassador in Moscow, confirmed that Russia had refused visas to Ambani, Mahindra, some entrepreneurs and a senior executive of Infosys in September. Mittal, however, was not mentioned. Sibal termed the episode a major obstacle in improving bilateral business relations.

 Bharti Group spokesperson Senjem Rajshekhar refused to comment on Mittals visa problem with Russia. This is a personal matter and you should speak to Mr Mittal about it but he is away, Rajshekhar said. Mittal could not be contacted. 

 Ambani has denied that he had applied for a visa to Moscow.

 However, a strong Indian response acted as a catalyst and the authorities of the two countries have worked hard to avoid a repeat of the episode. 

 A five-member Indian delegation led by the joint secretary, councillor of passport and visa, in the external affairs ministry and comprising home ministry officials met their Russian counterparts last week to lay down procedures for a visa regime, particularly regarding business visas. 

 A senior government official said Russia has agreed to grant business visas based on acceptance and validation of the sponsoring company. 

 In all probability, a full visa agreement will be signed in December when a Russian delegation visits India, the official said. 

 Once the agreement is signed, it will take less than a week to get a business visa to Russia which now takes at least a month or more due to lengthy processing done by the interior ministry of Russia, another official said.

 Sources said the Indian delegation also managed to prevail over Russias insistence to sign a treaty of re-admission and make it conditional to the visa agreement. 

 Re-admission treaties can be used to send immigrants back to the home country if it can be proved that their stay abroad is illegal. Several Indians live in Russia.

 The visa agreement would be a boon to Indian industry which is keen to invest in Russia in automobile, energy (oil and gas) and information technology.

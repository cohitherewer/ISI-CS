 Stars prolong ticket wait

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: The crowd outside the Congress? 24 Akbar Road headquarters is swelling with each passing day as ticket-seekers from Haryana, taking advantage of the state?s proximity to the capital, pour in to show off their support base to the high command to strengthen their case. 

 They might just be victims of bad luck ? destined to toil fruitlessly in ?the inauspicious transition days from Dakshinayana to Uttarayana?.

 Anxious as the ticket-seekers are for the early release of the list of candidates for the state?s 90 Assembly seats, the Congress high command is unlikely to oblige them for another three days.

 The leadership, though, is ready with almost the complete list ? less than half-a-dozen seats are pending. The final selection took place when the central election committee headed by party chief Sonia Gandhi met last Saturday, two days before the nomination process opened.

 Although the leadership is oozing confidence about wresting Haryana from Om Prakash Chautala in the February 3 election on its own, it is reluctant to announce the list till the transition from inauspicious Dakshinayana to auspicious Uttarayana takes place on Makar Sankranti, on January 14.

 Besieged by ticket-seekers outside his office, AICC treasurer Motilal Vora, who heads the party panel on selection of candidates for the state, said as much today. The list may not be out for the next two days, he announced, but did not give reasons for the delay.

 It is common knowledge that the late P.V. Narasimha Rao, a staunch believer in astrology, avoided making important political decisions during the period of transition from Dakshinayana to Uttarayana.

 The ?winning? tag attached to the Congress ticket in Haryana this time is said to be the reason for the unusually large crowd of ticket-seekers thronging the party headquarters now for over a fortnight.

 The word from the AICC is that the lucky ones might have already been sounded out by the leadership so that they do not waste their time and energy outside the headquarters. ?They might have already left for their constituencies to collect their B-form (the authorised letter of party nomination) from designated party functionaries,? said a party leader.

Laloo talks

 Keeping up the pressure on ally Laloo Prasad Yadav for tough bargaining in Bihar, the Congress brought in his critic and state party unit chief Ram Jatan Sinha to join HRD minister Arjun Singh at the negotiating table tonight.

 Having already pitched for 75 of the 243 assembly seats, the Congress negotiators circumvented the railway minister?s bid to meet Sonia Gandhi this evening ahead of his scheduled talks with Singh. Laloo Prasad was told the meeting was not possible as Sonia had just returned after a two-day visit to Rae Bareli. 

 The talks will continue tomorrow.

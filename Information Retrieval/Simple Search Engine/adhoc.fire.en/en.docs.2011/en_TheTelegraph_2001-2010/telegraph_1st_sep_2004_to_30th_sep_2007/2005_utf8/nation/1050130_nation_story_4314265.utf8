 BJP link slur on Shia board

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Jan. 29: The formal launch of the All India Shia Muslim Personal Law Board today got embroiled in controversy with a section of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and some veteran Shia leaders alleging that the creation of the new body was the BJP?s handiwork.

 The basis of the allegation is that the son of the new board?s president, Yasoob Abbas, is close to BJP leader Lalji Tandon. Some Sunni clerics even called the Shia board ?a Tandon board?.

 The members of the new board had chosen a hall at the PG Shia College in the old city area as the venue for the board?s inaugural meeting. One of the festoons read: ?Royal Family of Avadh welcomes formation of Shia Board?. Slogans like ?the sleeping giant is awake now? and ?Shia members vow for a long fight? rent the air even as members raised the issue of the community?s right to assert itself culturally, economically and socially.

 Delegates from various states and ulemas attended the meet while a posse of policemen stood on guard outside the hall. The police did not take any chances with the emergence of a rift between the Shias and Sunnis in a city that has a history of skirmishes between the sects.

 The formation of a separate Shia board could have a cascading effect on various sects of Muslims in north India. Besides, the rival board?s formation, which will shift the attention from the Muslim law board, formed in 1972, may eventually lead to the loss of collective bargaining power of the Muslims. But the new board?s office bearers blamed the law board for the same.

 Refuting Muslim board president Maulana Rabey Nadvi?s allegation that the new Shia board is politically motivated and was virtually created by the BJP, Maulana Mirza Mohammad Athar, the new board?s chief, said the rival leaders were maligning him ?because BJP leader Lalji Tandon lived in the old city?. 

 ?We have members who belong to all political parties,? he said. If the BJP was responsible for the creation of the Shia board, why could not the Sunni leaders stop the leaders of the Barelvi school of their own sect from forming a new board, Athar asked.

 ?Since Independence, the Shia sect has been marginalised. In the Union cabinet, there is no Shia minister and the same scenario has repeated itself in the state cabinet. The new Shia board would put pressure on the state and the central governments and various political parties for representation,? said Athar.

 Shikoh Azad, general secretary of the trusts run by the Avadh royal family, said the Muslim law board failed to do anything for the Shias in the last 32 years. The leaders of the new board spit fire on the domination of Sunni leaders in the older board.

 The Shia board today inducted 72 members in its executive body, including 22 ulemas who represent Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Delhi, Bihar, Bengal, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

 Bar brawl nears court

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 18: The ban on dance bars in Maharashtra is headed for the courts. 

 Nearly six weeks after announcing the ban, the state cabinet today decided to promulgate an ordinance to close down dance bars across the state, prompting a threat of litigation from bar owners and dancers.

 It was the knowledge that a court battle is inevitable that led the cabinet to accept its law and judiciary departments advice to promulgate an ordinance instead of issuing a notification. For, it knew an ordinance would have a better chance of standing up in a court than a notification.

 Deputy chief minister R.R. Patil, who returned from a tour of China yesterday, told reporters at the post-cabinet briefing: We will approve the draft of the proposed ordinance at next weeks cabinet meeting. It will then be sent to the governor for his approval. 

 The ordinance will seek amendments to section 33 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951, to facilitate cancellation of dance bars licences. 

 Patil had announced the ban on March 31 in the Assembly on the ground that dance bars corrupt the morals of the young generation. 

 The Mumbai Bar Girls Union has claimed the ban will leave about 75,000 bar girls and over 2 lakh male employees without jobs. 

 The organisation had taken to the streets in protest, with its leaders meeting Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the National Commission for Women.

 Commission chief Girija Vyas has backed the unions stand that the state must rehabilitate the bar girls before enforcing the ban.

 Patil was non-committal on whether the ordinance will contain any mention of rehabilitation. He, however, had ruled out rehabilitation of bar girls in the past on the ground that most of these girls belong to other states.

 Union president Varsha Kale said: We shall move court after we see a copy of the ordinance. We shall also try to meet the governor whose consent is necessary.

 The Fight for Right Bar Owners Association is the other organisation that has vowed to fight the ban in court.

 Ghazipur burns, day after

 - Hint of Bihar link in heartland legislator murder

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Nov. 30: A railway station was burnt, a power substation ransacked and set ablaze, and an attempt was made to torch a mosque in Ghazipur, near Varanasi, a day after the murder of a don-turned-BJP MLA. 

 Life in at least six neighbouring districts came to a halt. Schools were closed for the safety of children. At a number of stations, including Deoria, trains were stopped. Prohibitory orders were issued in disturbed areas and 20 companies of Rapid Action Force and Provincial Armed Constabulary were deployed.

 The state government has stationed two officers of the rank of additional director-general in Varanasi. 

 The state government is aware of the threat to disrupt communal amity as an attempt was made today at Ghazipur by some miscreants to set a mosque on fire. The gangs involved in the turf war are communally divided, said Aloke Sinha, principal secretary, home.

 BJP MLA Krishnand Rais murder yesterday afternoon is being blamed on gang rivalry. Rai is alleged to be a frontman for the Brijesh Singh gang. Brijesh, with a network covering Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, till recently controlled Varanasi, the commercial nerve centre of eastern Uttar Pradesh with its silk and carpet industries and coal and railway contracts.

 Suspected to have gone underground in 2000 after an Interpol red corner notice, Brijesh operated through several upper-caste dons, of whom Rai was alleged to be one.

 As Rai emerged stronger with Bhumihar and Rajput support, Mukhtar Ansari, a don-turned-Samajwadi legislator, perceived a threat. Ansari, who survived a bid on his life on January 14, was unsure of his strength outside Ghazipur and Mau.

 But the change of guard in neighbouring Bihar brought him closer to Mohammad Shahabuddin, the Rashtriya Janata Dal MP who has nearly three dozen criminal cases against him. A third player was Samajwadi Party MP Atiq Mohammad.

 Shahabuddin, facing the heat in Bihar, moved in to help Ansari gain a foothold in Gorakhpur and then the two, together with Atiq, extended their sway over a bigger region (see chart). With Atiq and Ansari belonging to the ruling party, the group is alleged to have got political patronage.

 Gradually Rais gang was becoming weak and we suspect some of his men had sided with the rival gang and passed on information on his movement to eliminate him, director-general of police Yashpal Singh said.

 Sources in Varanasi said a jeep found abandoned 20 km from the murder site could be from Bihar. It had three registration numbers. The jeep had 26 spent cartridges and some blood-stained clothes.

 We are contacting Bihar police to find out if the jeep had come from that state, A. Palnivel, additional director-general of police, said.

 Naveen green flag for VAT 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 21: Even as chief ministers of BJP-ruled states decided not to implement the value-added tax from April 1, the Naveen Patnaik government in Orissa today said it would go ahead with the new tax regime as planned.

 ?We are not party to this decision (not to implement VAT) and I don?t think they had invited us to the meeting where it was taken,? said finance minister and Biju Janata Dal leader Prafulla Chandra Ghadei, referring to the meeting of chief ministers of BJP-ruled states on VAT. 

 In Orissa, the BJP is the junior partner in the ruling coalition. ?We are going ahead with the decision to implement VAT from April 1,? Ghadei said, adding, ?as far as I know, no one has spoken to our chief minister about it.? 

 The Federation of All-Orissa Traders? Associations observed a daylong bandh across the state on Saturday in protest against the government?s decision.

 Ghadei said the chief ministers of all states had agreed to switch to the VAT regime at the meeting of the empowered committee last year. It was also decided that central sales tax would continue for 2005-06 and reduced to two percent in 2006-07. It would be phased out from 2007-08, he added. 

 The Orissa Assembly has passed a bill to this effect and there is no way the ruling party can back out now, the minister said.

 The stance of the BJD over VAT has put the state unit of the BJP in a quandary after its central leadership decided to oppose its implementation. 

 The BJP ministers had earlier adopted the legislation without a murmur of protest. Now, the BJD leaders are seemingly unhappy over the BJP?s change of mind on the implementation of VAT in its current form.

 The BJP will knock the chief minister?s doors, asking him to give his decision a second thought. ?We will request and appeal to Naveen Patnaik not to introduce VAT from April 1,? said a BJP leader here. He hoped that the ?successful? statewide trade bandh had opened Patnaik?s eyes to the demerits of the new tax regime. 

 Convener of the state BJP trade cell, Shyam Bihari Mishra, said VAT would result in an ?inspector raj? and increased prices. The entire business community is opposed to it and the BJP is the only party, which protects the interest of traders, he added.

 Satellite boost to mobile phones

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: Mobile phone technology in the country is set for a boost.

 The government today gave the go-ahead for a national satellite system that will provide digital multimedia broadcasting service via cell phones.

 (The) Union cabinet today gave its approval to undertake design, develop and launch Gsat-6 or Insat-4e, a multimedia mobile satellite mission, information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told reporters.

 The Indian Space Research Organisation will develop the satellite system at a cost of Rs 269 crore. The system will have a lifespan of 12 years and is expected to be launched in early 2008 with a lift-off capability of 2,100 kg.

 It will have three main benefits ? introduction of satellite digital multimedia service, demonstration of mobile satellite application to strategic and social sectors and advancing the frontiers of satellite technology using large unfurlable antennae, Das Munshi said.

 In another decision, the cabinet announced the Haj fares for next year. Each of the one lakh pilgrims will have to pay Rs 12,000 for a round trip to Jeddah. The Saudi Arabian airlines will take up to 60,000 pilgrims and Air-India and Indian Airlines the rest. The movement of pilgrims from India to Saudi Arabia begins later this month.

 Among the bills the cabinet cleared for tabling in Parliament in the ongoing winter session is the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2005, which aims to remove unnecessary restrictions on various commodities to ensure remunerative returns to farmers and promote consumer interest.

 The government is also planning to amend the commissions for protection of child rights bill. The legislation will seek implementation of the national policy for children and recommend action in cases of violation of child rights.

 Forest rights bill

 The cabinet will introduce the Scheduled Tribes (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill, 2005, in the winter session. 

 The bill is the first comprehensive legislation that addresses the long-standing tribal demand for greater rights over forests. But wildlife activists and environmentalists have warned that India would lose as much as 60 per cent of its forest cover if the bill is passed.

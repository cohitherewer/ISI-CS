 Migrant act veto protest 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, July 13: Rumblings of protest from minorities insecure after the Supreme Court struck down the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act tempered celebrations in Assam today.

 Two organisations representing the minorities, the Sankhalagu Yuva Parishad and the Fakrul Islam faction of the All Assam Minority Students Union (AAMSU), organised a rally in Morigaon to mobilise opinion for a rollback of yesterdays court order.

 The organisations jointly called an eight-hour statewide bandh tomorrow, beginning at 6 am. The Haroon-al-Rashid faction of the AAMSU separately announced a 12-hour bandh on Friday.

 The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and the Purbanchaliya Lok Parishad added to the tension by declaring their opposition to the bandh. 

 Emerging from an emergency meeting of his council of ministers, Tarun Gogoi said he was aware of the conflict of interests and had asked deputy commissioners and superintendents of police to pull out all stops to maintain peace and harmony.

 It is the duty of my government to ensure that no Indian citizen is harassed, he said, in a reference to the minorities fear that they will be discriminated against in the absence of the law. 

 Under the IM(DT) Act, in force in Assam, the onus of proving that a person was an illegal immigrant lay with the complainant. This is not the case with the Foreigners Act, applicable in the rest of India. 

 The chief minister said the IM(DT) Act had been enacted under special circumstances ? at the height of the anti-foreigner movement in 1983 ? to protect minorities from harassment on the pretext of driving out illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

 Trying hard not to sound critical of the courts judgment, Gogoi said his government was legally obliged to abide by it. I am sure the apex court considered the need to protect genuine Indian citizens from harassment while striking down the act. The court actually might have suggested some alternative measures.

 The state Congress met twice during the day. Gogoi left for New Delhi later.

Cong in a fix

 The Congress governments in both Delhi and Dispur find themselves in a Catch-22 situation in the wake of the apex courts verdict.

 The two options in front of them ? to seek a review of the apex courts ruling or push through a new legislation in Parliament to replace the discriminatory law ? are both fraught with difficulties. 

 Legal experts said the government could file a petition for a review, but the verdict was unlikely to be overturned. 

 The second option is to push for a new legislation with some of the provisions of the IM(DT) Act, but the party does not have the numbers in Parliament to see it through.

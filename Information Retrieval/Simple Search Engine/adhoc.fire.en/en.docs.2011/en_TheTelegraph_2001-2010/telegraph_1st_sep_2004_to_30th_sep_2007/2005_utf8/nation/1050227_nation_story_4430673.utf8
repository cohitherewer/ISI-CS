 DMK ups ?coalition? heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Feb. 26: The DMK, a key constituent of the Manmohan Singh government, is talking tough on junior Congress minister E.V.K.S. Elangovan?s remark that the ?time is ripe? for his party to demand a coalition in Tamil Nadu.

 Elangovan, a former state Congress chief, in a quick climbdown yesterday said his remarks had been misunderstood and expressed regrets to DMK chief M. Karunanidhi.

 But on the eve of a crucial party meeting in Chennai, the DMK does not appear convinced. The meeting of the party?s strategy committee has been called to discuss the ?current Indian political scenario?. DMK sources said the question of coalitions in states raised by Elangovan ?is only one of the issues to be discussed tomorrow?.

 More than that, the DMK is angry about the ?personal attacks? by the Union minister of state for commerce against Karunanidhi and his son M.K. Stalin at a Congress meeting here on Thursday evening. The party reportedly wants the Congress high command to make amends by taking strong action against Elangovan.

 The DMK ministers in the Union cabinet led by Dayanidhi Maran and T.R. Baalu are believed to have told the Prime Minister that they would rather not be in the cabinet when ?their leader is denigrated?. The party, like the Left, could offer outside support to the government, they are said to have added.

 However, DMK sources claimed their aim was not ?to pursue any personal or hidden agenda to take action against Elangovan?. ?That is Jayalalithaa?s style of functioning,? said a source.

 The Prime Minister telephoned Karunanidhi in a damage-control effort, reports PTI, adding that Congress sources said the matter had been sorted out.

 A DMK source said the party was only concerned about Elangovan making serious remarks on the coalition issue ?when he was not the competent person in the Congress party to speak on such issues and had no locus standi?. The DMK treasurer said it was what Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said that mattered.

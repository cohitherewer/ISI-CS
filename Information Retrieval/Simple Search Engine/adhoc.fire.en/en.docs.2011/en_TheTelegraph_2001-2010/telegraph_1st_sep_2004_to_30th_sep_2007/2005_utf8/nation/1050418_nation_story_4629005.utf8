 Tale of honour amp; honesty

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Biramitrapur (Sundargarh), April 17: Dressed in a plain saree and pink blouse, 40-year-old Mary Dungdung does not come across as a regular politician. As she fries and sells snacks at her small eatery in Deokaran Dafai, 26 km from Rourkela, on a particularly hot and humid afternoon, it is difficult to believe that the tribal woman once headed the Biramitrapur Notified Area Council (BNAC).

 While most politicians in Orissa have amassed fortunes and built palatial bungalows, Mary has chosen to lead a spartan life. Instead, she now sells snacks along with her husband Zailas from a dilapidated hut to earn her daily bread.

 Not long ago, Mary signed and disposed of official files during her tenure as chairperson of the BNAC between July 1997 and July 2002. She had fought the election on a Congress ticket. 

 As the first woman to head the BNAC, she not only handled civic affairs with elan but also tried to make the councillors realise the importance of development.

 Playing the multiple roles of wife, mother and a working woman, all that mattered to Mary, a matriculate, was the necessity to hold her head high. As the chairperson of the council, she had ample scope to siphon off money from official projects, but she did not fall prey to greed.

 ?All that I wanted was to serve the people and give them a better life,? says the 40-year-old, who thinks making money from development projects is equal to blasphemy.

 In the 2002 civic election, the Congress did not give her a ticket and the Biramitrapur council went to the Biju Janata Dal. In the absence of support from her party, Mary eventually gave up politics and settled for a more humble life. ?Thanks to the shop, I can give my son a proper education,? she says.

 Mary?s five-year stint in BNAC was not just about putting in mindless hours and disposing of countless files. When she took charge in 1997, all that mattered to her was the development of the area. In her short stint, Mary gifted tube-wells to all 11 wards under the council. A homoeopathic hospital came up for tribals while several villages suddenly had motorable roads. She was also responsible for the electrification of about half-a-dozen villages under BNAC.

 Local residents as well as political leaders agree that Mary was never a politician in the conventional sense. ?She was not a politician like us. She was a social activist at heart,? says Biramitrapur MLA Nihar Surin.

 Laxmi Surin, a villager, recounts how Mary led a group of women to raise their voice against the sale and consumption of liquor and formed the Kasturba Gandhi Mahila Samiti. The organisation has provided training on sewing to scores of women till date. ?Most of BNAC?s development projects were undertaken by Mary,? Laxmi says.

 On her future, Mary says, ?I am still in touch with the people of Biramitrapur. They like me. At least my prestige is intact, unlike other leaders.?

 New car fuel norms kick off today

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Calcutta, March 31: The air will be cleaner; even babies in the womb will be safer.

 The Bharat Stage-III norms, which come into force in 11 cities across India from tomorrow, are not only about 40 per cent cleaner vehicular emission. They would also monitor for the first time levels of the extremely toxic and carcinogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) in fuels that are harmful for foetuses. 

 According to a recent study by the US-based National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, exposure to specific combustion pollutants during pregnancy were found to be the cause of chromosomal abnormalities in foetal tissues in around 60 babies.

 The norms come into effect in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore, Pune, Ahmedabad, Agra, Kanpur, Surat and Hyderabad.

 Anumita Roychoudhury, the associate director of the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, said the norms are the first steps towards establishing legal standards for PAH and for cleaner vehicular fuel at the refinery level.

 Roychoudhury said by implementing the norms, the 11 cities will be ?five years behind Europe? when it comes to cleaning up vehicular emissions. ?Though Europe is enforcing Euro IV this year, these norms are 60 per cent more lax than the US norms. The US is now phasing in the world?s most strict emission norms. It has already introduced the Tier II norms in 2004 with fuel neutral standards,? Roychoudhury added.

 In Calcutta, oil companies and car manufacturers said they were ready to comply with the norms in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.

 ?We have renovated and equipped our refineries and filtration plants to produce BS-III compliant fuel,? said Gautam Dutta, the general manager of Indian Oil Corporation.

 ?In fact, we are supplying the improved fuel at all the petrol pumps in the CMA since early this month. Fuel supplied to pumps in other parts of Bengal is BS-II compliant but gradually all these pumps, too, will get BS-III standard fuel.?

 The CMA area includes the city and parts of North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Nadia.

 Kalyan Roy, officer-on-special duty, Hindustan Petroleum, said they had taken the initiative much earlier to equip the plants to produce BS-III standard fuel keeping in mind the April 1 deadline. ?We are happy to say that we have been able to supply BS-III fuel even before the deadline,? Roy said.

 Southern scions for free speech

 M.R. VENKATESH

 (Top) Kanimozhi, 

 Karti: Nothing political?

 Chennai, Nov. 13: Actor Kushboo, under fire from the moral brigade for appearing to condone pre-marital sex, can breathe easy. The scions of two of Tamil Nadus most prominent political families are ready to take up her cause ? as part of a larger one.

 Kanimozhi, daughter of DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, and Karti Chidambaram, the son of the Union finance minister, have together launched a forum that champions free speech. Karuthu (opinion) offers every resident of the state, young or old, a platform to speak their mind on any subject as long as they do not defame anyone.

 We want to hold a meeting every month, preferably in colleges, to create an awareness of the fundamental freedoms. Anybody can write to us or post their views on our website, a free site with no barriers, Karti, a lawyer, said.

 We (Karuthu) will not have a collective view on any subject. There are no office-bearers, no hierarchy and not even a physical office. All those who believe in the freedom of expression can be members. People will have different opinions and all we are saying is there is room for all and that their opinions will be heard.

 Neither Karti nor Kanimozhi ? both in their 30s ? have ever been connected with a public organisation. Karuthu could provide them with a launching pad for future political careers. 

 Karti said floating Karuthu is a small step to bring back the culture of tolerance in Tamil Nadu. He denied the move was inspired by the Kushboo controversy but, when pressed, acknowledged that Kushboo had a right to express her views.

 Kushboo was quoted by a magazine as saying that she had no objections to women having pre-marital sex as long as they took precautions against disease and pregnancy. 

 The alleged remark prompted political parties such as the PMK and the Dalit Panthers of India to raise a stink and virtually lay a siege around her, forcing her to apologise. Some 23 court cases were filed against the actor within a week.

 Actor Suhasini, who recently expressed support for Kushboo, was targeted by PMK workers at Vandavasi yesterday.

 Kanimozhi, a poet, said political parties and social organisations that seize on individuals comments to raise an outcry are bringing about a kind of majoritarianism crushing the expression of any new views or ideas by the minority, thus opening the gateway to fascism. She said the youth, women and artists are the worst sufferers.

 Karti had a caution, though: No personal attacks (at the forum) please.

 He explained that one of the objectives behind floating the forum was to guide people towards discussing issues, for politics in the state had become too personalised.

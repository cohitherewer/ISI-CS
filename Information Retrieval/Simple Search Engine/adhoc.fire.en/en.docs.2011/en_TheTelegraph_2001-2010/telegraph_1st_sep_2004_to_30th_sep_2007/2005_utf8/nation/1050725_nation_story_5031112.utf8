 Pakistan team on Baglihar mission

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, July 24: A team of experts from Pakistan arrived today to inspect the Baglihar hydroelectric project ? the third in as many years ? fuelling concern among Indian officials.

 The team, which will stay overnight at the Patnitop tourist resort before inspecting the project site on Monday and Tuesday, will submit its findings to the Pakistan government and also share them with Indian officials. 

 However, local officials fear that the findings will be yet another listing of objections.

 The inspection by the experts from Pakistan, led by the countrys commissioner of Indus Water Treaty, Syed Jamat Ali Shah, precedes the visit of the World Bank-nominated arbitrator, Raymond Lafitte. 

 The teams visit comes within three weeks of the massive floods that caused damage at the project site and in the low-lying areas of Pakistans Punjab through which the Chenab flows.

 Earlier visits by Pakistani teams have ended with objections about the height and design of the project, which the country insists violates the 45-year-old World Bank-brokered Indus Water Treaty. 

 The pact allows Pakistan to monitor the use of the waters of the Jhelum, Indus and Chenab, which flow through Jammu and Kashmir.

 Islamabad argues that the 114.5 metre-high dam, which will have an enormous storage capacity, can starve it of water. 

 In times of floods, the water released for the safety of the dam would inundate low-lying areas of Pakistan, the country contends.

 We have all the arguments on our side, but lets see what they say, the Jammu divisional commissioner, Braj Raj, said when asked about the possible purpose of the visit of the Pakistani team.

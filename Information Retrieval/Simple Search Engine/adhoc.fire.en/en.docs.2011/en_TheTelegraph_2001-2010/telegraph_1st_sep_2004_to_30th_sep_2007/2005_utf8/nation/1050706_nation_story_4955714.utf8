New Delhi, July 5 (PTI): The ban hasnt gone up in smoke yet, but the huff for a puff seems to have had an effect.

 Under pressure from the entertainment industry, the government today appeared to hint that the ban on smoking scenes in films and serials from October 2 might be headed for dilution.

 The category of exceptions to the ban on smoking scenes could be expanded, information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy told reporters after a workshop, in which film-makers, social activists, health ministry officials and medical experts took part. 

 It is a continuous process. Whatever comes in the way of aesthetic appeal may be given up, he said.

 The four-hour session, organised by Reddys minis- try, ended with the government agreeing to more self-censorship by the industry and expansion of creative freedom.

 The government had announced the ban on June 15 but said exceptions would be made for period movies and those portraying historical characters known to be smokers and for films that show someone smoking only to emphasise how bad it is for health.

 Sharmila Tagore, the chairperson of the Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC), said such a near-blanket ban was not possible as it impinged on artistic expression of film-makers. 

 Director Mahesh Bhatt also objected to the ban.

 Reddy said a steering committee, which would have representatives from the industry, government and consumer and social activist groups, would be formed to take forward the process of consultation.

 The minister said the film industry agreed to practise self-regulation. 

 It was felt there is a need for film and television industry to have a self-regulatory body to review the issues of social responsibility before submission of films to CBFC for certification, Reddy added.

 Along with the ban on smoking, other issues that were discussed included depiction of women and underprivileged sections in films and portrayal of social evils.

 China peace, not an inch less

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Leimakhong (Manipur) Sept. 21: A day ahead of visiting forward army posts on the border with China in Arunachal Pradesh, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today signalled New Delhis eagerness to settle frontier disputes with Beijing without compromising on territory.

 Mukherjee is scheduled to address army troops at Tawang in Arunachal tomorrow morning in a sector that has a 270-km-long border frontage with China. 

 China claims 90,000 sq km of territory ? practically the whole of Arunachal Pradesh ? but is intensely engaged in military confidence-building measures and negotiations to resolve the dispute. 

 National security adviser M.K. Narayanan, who is also the special envoy for the talks, is expected to visit Beijing for the next round later this month.

 We are moving ahead in our effort to improve relations with our neighbouring countries, especially Pakistan and China, Mukherjee told troops at the army divisional headquarters in Manipur today. 

 At the same time, we will not allow any country to take even an inch of our territory. Our troops are fully capable of securing our borders.

 The defence ministers visit to army establishments in the Northeast that will conclude with his visit to Tawang ? weather permitting ? tomorrow is a survey on both counter-insurgency operations and border security. 

 Last month, Mukherjee unwillingly stepped into a row with the Chinese ambassador in Mumbai. The Chinese envoy had objected to a public speech by Mukherjee in which the defence minister said China had invaded India in 1962. Mukherjee put down the argument by describing the event as an indisputable fact.

 The incident just shows how touchy both New Delhi and Beijing are despite the engagement at the talks table. Mukherjees visit is taking place at a time when the armies of the two countries that have been eyeball-to-eyeball in the years of tension are actively creating an atmosphere of bonhomie on the border.

 Chinese army officers and soldiers visited Indian posts near Tawang with their families on August 15 to participate in the troops Independence Day celebrations.

 The Indian Army is expected to send a delegation for Chinas celebrations on October 1.

 But while the confidence-building measures are in place for the two armies, the talks have not reached a settlement on any of the three sectors of disputes (western, central and eastern). By far, the biggest territory that is disputed by China is in the eastern sector (Arunachal Pradesh).

 Mukherjee will be given a briefing at the headquarters of the armys 4 Corps in the morning by the General Officer Commanding, Lt General H.S. Lidder. He will then take a helicopter to Tawang. After an address to troops, Mukherjee will be given a helicopter tour of the posts on the Line of Actual Control.

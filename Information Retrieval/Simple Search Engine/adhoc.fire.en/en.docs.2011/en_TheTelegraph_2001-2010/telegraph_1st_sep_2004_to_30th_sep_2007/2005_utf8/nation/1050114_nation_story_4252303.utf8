 Job quota row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Activists are peeved that the Union Public Service Commission has earmarked only seven of the 21 civil service streams for disabled persons qualifying in the UPSC examination this year. 

 This is the first time that the UPSC has shortlisted specific services for eligible disabled persons. These include the Indian Administrative Service, Indian P amp;T Accounts amp; Finance Service, Indian Audit and Accounts Service, Indian Defence Accounts Service, Indian Ordnance Factories Service (Group A) and the Armed Forces Headquarters Civil Service (Group B). 

 Disabled rights activist Javed Abidi, the convener of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People, described the UPSC?s move a ?practical joke?. 

 Last January, the UPSC had appointed a three-member committee headed by then social justice secretary B.S. Baswan to identify the streams in which handicapped persons qualifying in the civil services examination could be accommodated. 

 ?We had thought the Baswan panel would do some good work by identifying the services where the disabled can be allotted. But when we saw the advertisement for UPSC 2005, we were disappointed as it seemed to have been done in a hurried manner without much thought,? said Abidi.

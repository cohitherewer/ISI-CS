 House heads for clash with HC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 23: The Uttar Pradesh Assembly today headed for a clash with the judiciary by deciding to take up a matter that is already before the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court.

 The issue involves a petition to disqualify 13 MLAs who had defected from the Bahujan Samaj Party in August 2003, helping the Samajwadi Party topple the Mayavati government.

 The Bahujan Samaj Partys legislature party chief, Swami Prasad Maurya, had filed the petition in September 2003. But Keshrinath Tripathi, who was the Speaker, did not take it up for hearing because a case seeking to disqualify the MLAs had also been filed in the high court.

 The current Speaker, Mata Prasad Pandey, today revived Mauryas petition and fixed the hearing for July 1.

 At a time when the high court had speeded up the case ? the next date of hearing being July 5 ? Pandeys decision has caused surprise.

 Bahujan Samaj Party sources suggested that the move was aimed at delaying the high court procedures against these MLAs.

 Pandey has argued that under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, the Speaker is the supreme authority in matters of disqualification of MLAs. 

 Now that the Speaker is ready to hear this, we dont know what to say, Maurya said. We will draw the attention of Allahabad High Court to this.

 On August 26, 2003, these 13 MLAs had approached Vishnu Kant Shastri, who was governor at that time, saying they were ready to break away from the Bahujan Samaj Party if they were recognised as a separate group in the House.

 Later, 27 other Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs joined them, formed a group and merged it with the Samajwadi Party. 

 Their former party, which saw its strength fall from 109 to 69 in the Assembly, approached the high court against all 40 defectors.

 Water flows back to India

 Deepa: Excited 

 Toronto, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Five years after hardliners forced Deepa Mehta to halt production of Water in Varanasi, the expatriate filmmaker will bring the controversial film to India amid tight security this week.

 Toronto-based Mehta yesterday expressed a mixture of excitement and nervousness about going to south India for the International Film Festival of Kerala, which kicks off on Friday with an open-air screening of Water for 5,000 people.

 If the film gets judged as a film, as opposed to the baggage of controversy, then well be fine, she said.

 Mehta added that the Kerala organisers purposely held off announcing Water as their opening-night film until now to ensure a goon element did not disrupt the festivals launch.

 They arent scared. Theyre very sure that nothing untoward will happen, said the filmmaker, now a Canadian citizen.

 Mehta and producer David Hamilton secretly shot Water in Sri Lanka in 2004 under the working title River Moon, after death threats from hardliners and a rioting mob four years earlier forced a halt to the production in Varanasi.

 Set in 1930s India, Water tells the story of an 8-year-old Hindu child bride who is exiled to a widows ashram after her husband dies.

 Hardliners have criticised Mehta for disparaging their culture and religion, a charge she vigorously denies.

 Water was picked up by Fox Searchlight for a US release in April 2006 after the Hindi-language picture opened the Toronto International Film Festival in September. 

 The film, which stars Lisa Ray and John Abraham, has done an impressive Canadian $1.2 million at the box office there since its November 4 release.

 Mehta anticipates a host of Indian exhibitors and distributors will see Water in Kerala for the first time, possibly ahead of a theatrical release in India.

 Drill to harness truant MPs 

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 (Top) Rahul, Jyotiraditya: 

 Absentees, beware 

 New Delhi, March 16: The 

 Congress leadership is cracking its whip on attendance in 

 Parliament ? MPs who play truant are under threat of being 

 excluded from the much-sought-after foreign junkets.

 Concerned about habitual absence of MPs even during important debates, including the ongoing budget discussion in the Lok Sabha, the party has decided to maintain an attendance record that can be considered while nominating members to parliamentary delegations going abroad. 

 The Congress parliamentary party has already set measures rolling to check absenteeism, particularly during afternoon hours. Party members in each House have been divided into two groups ? A and B. A daily roster is being finalised, according to which each group will be required to do duty for at least two hours in the House concerned. Signatures of all MPs are being collected to ensure they do not feign ignorance later.

 ?If members belonging to one of the groups are required to be compulsorily present between 2 pm and 4 pm, the other group members would have to be present from 4 pm till the end of the day?s proceedings,? said a party leader. 

 The Congress, however, is not sure whether the drill will yield desired results. ?We are doing this at CPP leader Sonia Gandhi?s behest. She is unhappy about the poor attendance. If even after this exercise, the attendance does not improve, we will go back to her. We may then have to consider whether to entertain the requests of habitually absentee members for inclusion in foreign junket delegations,? the leader said. 

 Sonia herself skipped the debate today as she was away in Andhra Pradesh. 

 Despite oral instructions from parliamentary party leaders, only a handful of Congress MPs have been present in the Lok Sabha since yesterday when the budget discussion started. Nor are the Congress members the only ones playing truant ? the malaise cuts across party lines. Had any member raised the question of quorum at any time on either day, proceedings would have collapsed. 

 Within the Congress, the warhorses and the baba log ?the clutch of young MPs, led by Rahul Gandhi ? are equally guilty. Barring the odd exception, leading lights from neither group have attended the debate that ends tomorrow.

 Jyotiraditya Scindia was the only one from the junior MPs? club who was seen in House. He was present briefly yesterday, when it was his turn to speak. He was sighted this afternoon as well.

 Contrary to earlier indications, Rahul is unlikely to make his maiden speech during the budget debate. His name does not figure on the list of speakers drawn up by the party. 

 The Congress move comes in the midst of a series of steps taken by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee to improve House attendance.

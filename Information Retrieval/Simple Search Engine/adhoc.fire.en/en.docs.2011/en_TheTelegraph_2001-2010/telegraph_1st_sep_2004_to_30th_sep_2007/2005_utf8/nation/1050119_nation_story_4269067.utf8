 Spin shifts spot 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 18: Sunspot 

 720, a giant blot on the sun, is slowly changing position 

 due to the sun?s rotation on its own axis. 

 ?The sunspot caused a big flare ? an X3-class explosion that peaked at 3.20 pm on January 17,? said Debiprosad Duari, director, research and academics, MP Birla Planetarium. ?As a result, a coronal mass ejection is coming towards the Earth. 

 A coronal mass ejection is a huge bubble of hot gas (plasma) threaded with magnetic field lines that are ejected from the sun. They drive all major geomagnetic storms, which can disrupt the flow of solar wind and produce disturbances that strike the Earth. 

 The ejection is expected to hit the Earth?s magnetic field by tomorrow. 

 On January 15, there were three flares. Solar flares are of three categories ? X-class, M-class and C-class. X-class flares are the biggest and can trigger planet-wide radio blackouts and long-lasting radiation storms. 

 Bright auroras ? a result of the geomagnetic activity ? have been sighted in Alaska and Canada. They are expected on the southern Australian skies over the next two nights.

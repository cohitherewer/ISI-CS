 Manners tips for priests

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 22: In a bid to make a visit to the 12th century Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri a more pleasant experience for tourists, the Orissa government has decided to impart lessons on behaviour to priests.

 The government took the decision after receiving several complaints on the unruly behaviour of a section of local people and the priests. At present, the temple has around 250 employees, including 36 categories of priests.

 Recently, the president of the All-India Tour Operators? Association, Subash Goel, had vowed that he would never return to the temple with his family after they were manhandled by the priests there. 

 At a high-level meeting chaired by Governor Rameswar Thakur, the government felt that the temple priests needed to be taught how to behave with devotees and tourists. It has decided to drive home the message that heritage sites like the Jagannath Temple were not mere sources of income. 

 ?People should refrain from becoming exploitative,? Thakur said, adding that people should not be misled or exploited at heritage sites. Dibyasingha Deb, who heads the temple management committee, has given his consent while the priests, too, have promised their cooperation.

 Besides the sermon on etiquette, the temple would also undergo a facelift. The meeting decided that Ananda Bazar, the eatery inside the temple, would be renovated and developed in keeping with the requirements of tourists and devotees. Steps would be initiated to ensure a healthy and clean environment at Ananda Bazar, visited by hundreds of tourists everyday.

 Among the other decisions were the preparation of a five-year vision document for the development of the temple and creation of a Rs 100 crore-corpus fund, said sources.

 The government recently appointed a senior IAS officer as the temple?s chief administrator and an IPS officer as the head of security. It is also planning to sell all plots of land registered in the name of the temple to improve its financial status.

 The temple is in dire need of money for its day-to-day activities. It earns about Rs 5.5 crore per year, which is inadequate for its operations.

 The temple has about 700 acres of land registered in its name in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. In Orissa, it possesses about 5,400 acres of land. Large chunks of the plots in the state have been taken over by encroachers.

 With the sale of its land, the administration is hoping to earn about Rs 100 crore.

 Students killed in school gate crash

 Madurai (PTI): Four primary schoolchildren 

 were killed and seven injured when the school?s steel gate 

 on which they were swinging collapsed on them in Virudhunagar 

 district on Friday.

 Three children died on the spot. Another succumbed to head injuries at a government hospital on Saturday. Two of the injured students are in serious condition while the others have recovered.

 Virudhunagar police said the walls, on either side of the gate, were weak and collapsed along with the gate on the children during their evening playtime. It took more than an hour to pull out the children. The deceased were all Class II students. 

 The private school is located on the Sethur-Kollam highway road, about 80 km from here. 

 District education department officials have questioned the headmaster and the correspondent of the school on why the children were allowed to swing on the gate. They were also asked to explain why the compound wall was not properly maintained. The officials have conducted an on-the-spot inquiry.

 The headmaster, the correspondent and the secretary of the school were arrested and produced before the judicial magistrate at Srivilliputhur. They have been remanded in judicial custody for 15 days.

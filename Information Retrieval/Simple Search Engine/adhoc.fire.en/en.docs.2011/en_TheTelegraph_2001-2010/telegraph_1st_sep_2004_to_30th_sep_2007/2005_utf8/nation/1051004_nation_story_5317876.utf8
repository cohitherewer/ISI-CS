 Legal pact push with US 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: India and the US today ratified a mutual legal assistance treaty that will make escape nearly impossible for fugitives in either country.

 The ratification of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) brings the pact into force immediately and is an important step forward in Indo-US law enforcement and counter-terrorism co-operation.

 Union home secretary V.K. Duggal and US ambassador to India David C. Mulford today signed the protocol. The MLAT was signed by the Presidents of India and the US this year. India has already signed the MLAT with 15 countries that include the UK, Canada, France, Switzerland and Russia. 

 The treaty enhances the ability of two nations to put in place a regularised channel for obtaining law enforcement assistance from each other.

 Indian home ministry officials said the treaty would also improve implementation of the extradition treaty between the India and the US.

 We are confident that this treaty will further enhance co-operation between our two countries to combat criminal activities, drug trafficking and the scourge of terrorism, said Mulford.

 Prescription ready for rural medics

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: The Medical Council of India is ready with an alternative undergraduate medical education programme which, if implemented, will radically change the face of the rural health system.

 The MCI sub-committee set up for putting together an alternative framework is finally ready with the draft. It will now be put up before the Union health ministry, K.M. Shyamprasad, member of the rural task force set up by health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, said.

 The alternative curriculum will not come in place of the present MBBS course but will co-exist with it. Its objective is to impart integrated medical training to students willing to work in badly-equipped primary rural health centres.

 In most of these places, you do not have the benefit of a tertiary health care system. You have to make do without facilities like ultra-sound or other sophisticated tests, Shyamprasad, also the vice-president of the National Board of Examinations in the health ministry, said.

 He said the success of the alternative curriculum would, however, depend on whether the ministry is willing to notify the course as an MBBS course. 

 Unlike the lecture-oriented format of the present MBBS syllabus, the alternative curriculum will have problem-based learning as its focus. There will be emphasis on fundamental aspects and on the common problems of health and disease. It will avoid unnecessary details of specialisation, the MCI said.

 Fifty students will be admitted to the course every year. Those who have done most of their schooling in villages will be given priority.

 Like the MBBS, its duration is four and a half years plus a one-year compulsory pre-registration rotary internship.

 The alternative curriculum takes the centre of medical education to the primary health centre. Community component will be introduced from the very beginning of the course, the MCI says.

 Training in clinical methods and skills will be imparted at the primary health level so that students can provide useful community service.

 The students will have to spend one and a half years each at the primary (block health centres/ rural hospitals), secondary (district/sub divisional hospitals) and tertiary health care centres.

 More emphasis will be on learning experiences gathered from interactive sessions, practical demonstrations and community visits rather than didactic lectures as is the current norm, the draft says.

 Phase I of the curriculum includes 50 modules dealing with epidemiological methods, community health studies, general health problems and clinical examination.

 Phase II includes three semesters of six months each. In the first semester, the student will study respiratory, urinary and nervous systems and infectious diseases.

 The second semester includes a study of gynaecological problems, school health and common paediatric illnesses. The third focuses on the male genital system, fractures, bone and joint problems, blood transfusion and disaster management. Phase III includes training in community medicine, forensic medicine, obstetrics, ophthalmology and gynaecology.

 There will be a university-level exam at the end of each phase and an internal assessment. 

 A student will be allowed to do a one-year internship after qualifying the exam at the end of the third phase. The learner is expected to conduct actual practice of medical and health care during this phase, the draft says.

 By the end of the training, the draft says, the student should be able to diagnose clinically common diseases and manage emergencies.

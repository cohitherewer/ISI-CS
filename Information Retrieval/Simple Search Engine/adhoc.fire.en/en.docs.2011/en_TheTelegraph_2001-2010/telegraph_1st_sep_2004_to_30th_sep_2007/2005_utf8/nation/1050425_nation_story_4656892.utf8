 China rolls out red carpet for king

 Gyanendra: Neighbour nods

 Beijing, April 24: China assured King Gyanendra of its full ?support? and ?friendship? when the now absolute monarch of Nepal attended the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) conference in southern Hainan province. 

 ?Sino-Nepalese ties have maintained a momentum of constant and sound development? despite the differences in each domestic situation,? said Jia Qinglin, the chairman of National Committee of Chinese People?s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China?s top advisory body.

 Jia added that China?s support for the king, who sacked the elected government of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on February 1, was ?beneficial? for regional peace and stability.

 The comments come a week before May 1, when the three-month state of Emergency clamped by Gyanendra after he sacked the government will expire. 

 Under Nepal?s constitution, the king needs parliamentary approval to extend the Emergency. Nepal has been running without a parliament since May 2002, when Deuba dissolved the Lower House for refusing to extend the Emergency he had imposed in November 2001. 

 Other than China, no other nation has voiced support for the king, whose suspension of civil liberties in Nepal has prompted severe international criticism. Several European nations and civil liberties groups have said the Royal Nepalese Army has illegally detained more than 600 people over the last three months.

 China has declared the king?s action as an ?internal matter?, and Chinese vice-foreign Minister Wu Dawei has said ?the international community should respect the choice made by the Nepali people?. 

 To back its support with actions, China became the first nation to grant the king diplomatic legitimacy by sending its foreign minister Li Zhaoxing to Kathmandu on April 1, two months after the coup. China, backed by Pakistan and Russia, is also preventing the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva from proposing tough measures against Nepal for its deteriorating human rights situation. 

 Such unstinting support for Gyanendra stands in contrast to India, which has decried the sacking of Deuba?s government and called for a return to democracy. But Beijing?s growing clout on the world stage was evidenced when shortly after China?s welcome of the king, India indicated that it would reconsider the arms embargo on Nepal.

 Analysts say Delhi fears that taking too hard a line with the king would push him closer to Beijing. With China already enjoying close relations with Burma, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, India can ill afford to ?lose? Nepal, the analysts added.

 Already, Li?s April 1 endorsement of Nepal has led several other nations to make reconciliatory gestures towards the king, despite India?s continuing opposition. 

 Before flying to the Boao Forum, which China touts as the Asian equivalent of the World Economic Forum held in Davos, the king attended the Bandung Conference in Jakarta on the invitation of Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and South African President Thabo Mbeki. 

 The conference gave the king his first international opportunity to defend his actions. 

 His entourage, which included queen Komal, princess Prerana, vice-chairman of the council of ministers Kirti Nidhi Bista and foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey, privately lobbied for more understanding of what is happening in Nepal. 

 The king?s position is that he had no choice but to dismiss the government as it was failing to end a Maoist insurgency that has gripped Nepal since the mid-1990s.

 But there is little evidence that the king?s actions, or China?s support, have fazed the guerrillas. Just days after the king took power, the Maoists called for a nationwide strike across the landlocked nation and disrupted supplies of petrol and essential goods into Kathmandu for two weeks.

 Two days ago, the day the king landed in China, the Maoists called for an 11-day general strike. 

 After the king wraps up his visit here on Tuesday, he will fly to Singapore where he will meet President S. Ramanathan.

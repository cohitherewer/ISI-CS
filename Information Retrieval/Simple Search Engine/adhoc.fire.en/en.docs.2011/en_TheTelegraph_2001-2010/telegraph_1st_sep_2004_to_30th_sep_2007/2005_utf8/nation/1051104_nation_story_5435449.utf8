The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Workers welfare act on Centre table

 A farmer at work: Sowing hope

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The National Advisory Council, headed by Sonia Gandhi, is working to fulfil a commitment to ensure social security for the unorganised sector.

 The UPA had said in its common minimum programme that it is firmly committed to ensure the welfare and well-being of workers, particularly those in the unorganised sector who constitute 93 per cent of our workforce.

 The NAC has submitted a note and its version of the Unorganised Sector Workers Social Security Act, 2005, to the Centre, which are available on its website.

 It has recognised that only about 8 per cent workers get benefits under the Provident Fund Act and the Factories Act. About 92 per cent (over 30 crore) workers have insecure jobs and low incomes though they contribute over 60 per cent of the GDP.

 Such workers include the self-employed small and marginal farmers, artisans, street vendors, contract workers, etc., who have no bargaining power, no fixed income and no social security net.

 The NAC has also stressed that the bureaucracy has neither the manpower nor the know-how to reach the scattered crores of workers.

 In its draft bill, which it termed 

 enabling legislation, the NAC has said its objectives 

 are to:

 Redefine the worker to 

 include even those who have no fixed employer like self-employed 

 workers, casual, contract, home-based workers etc.;

 Identify each worker and 

 give him/her a unique social security number and card;

 Offer a variety of social 

 security benefits like health insurance, maternity benefits 

 and pension;

 Ask the central government 

 to underwrite a minimum amount of benefits and funds while 

 simultaneously creating a structure that will engage civil 

 society and semi-government outfits;

 Encourage unorganised workers 

 to organise themselves around the social security structure, 

 creating a voice and space for them.

 The bill defines the implementing mechanism as a structure to reach the worker in every village and hamlet. It says the nodal point would be worker facilitation centres which would register workers, mobilise them, deliver benefits, secure contributions, maintain a database, upgrade skills, set up employment exchanges and train and help workers to band themselves into co-operatives and federations and so on.

 The bill provides for a central social security authority to execute the act. The authority ? it will have representatives of the central and state governments, unorganised workers and professionals ? will be run by a managing director and two directors appointed by the Centre and will be responsible for managing funds.

 The bill mentions the following sources of funds: 

 Levy and collection of 

 cess, tax or fees;

 Grants and loans from the 

 central and state governments;

 Other sources, including 

 donations, which will be channelled through the Centre.

 The bill makes it incumbent on employers to contribute to the welfare funds through a cess or an appropriate tax levied by the Centre or by creating a mechanism to collect contributions from individual employers or their contractors.

 The NAC apart, the Centre is also working on a legislation for the unorganised sector. In September 2004, it constituted the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector under the chairmanship of Arjun Sengupta.

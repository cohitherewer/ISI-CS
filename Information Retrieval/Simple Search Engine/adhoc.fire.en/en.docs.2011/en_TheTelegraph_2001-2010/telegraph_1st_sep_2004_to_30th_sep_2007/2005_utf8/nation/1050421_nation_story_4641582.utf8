 Court blow to Kurien order

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, April 20: Verghese Kurien, father of the milk revolution, suffered a setback in the ongoing turf war at an institute that he had set up 25 years ago.

 Gujarat High Court today passed an interim ruling nullifying the ?unlawful order? of Kurien, the chairman of the Institute of Rural Management at Anand, made famous by the milk cooperative Amul, to sack its director K. Prathap Reddy. 

 Justice Akil Kureshi said: ?Prima facie, (the) IRMA chairman?s order terminating Reddy as director was without authority and unlawful.?

 Reddy had moved court after Kurien sacked him on April 7 and appointed L.K. Vaswani in his place.

 Amrita Patel, one-time protege of Kurien who has now fallen out with her mentor, had questioned the appointment of Vaswani during the board meeting. Patel, chairperson of the National Dairy Development Board, has been locked in a conflict with Kurien for some time over Amul?s marketing practices.

 The court today upheld Reddy?s argument that the IRMA constitution clearly states that the director is appointed by the board of governors and only the board, not the chairman, can sack him. Therefore, Kurien?s order is illegal, so is the appointment of Vaswani, the court said. 

 Kurien has decided to go in for appeal in the division bench against today?s order.

 Reddy said his stand has been vindicated and he will go to office tomorrow. However, it is unlikely that he will be allowed to resume work before the final verdict on May 2. Reddy said he has decided to leave the institute after being reinstated, though his tenure will end only in September. 

 The director said he had initially planned to return to Hyderabad and join an NGO after the retirement. ?But my plans have gone haywire because of this unsavoury controversy. Now I will have to reschedule my plan to quit.?

 His advocate Dhaval Dave said: ?Our position has been redeemed.? 

 Hasmukh Shah, the chairman of the National Institute of Design, who, along with IIMA director Bakul Dholakia and industrialist Vijay Mahajan, was prevented from attending the IRMA board meeting on April 15, said: ?Thank god, it is summer vacation and fresh students are yet to join. Otherwise, students would have suffered and the institute would have been ruined beyond imagination.?

 Shah said the order has far reaching implications. Certificates/diplomas issued at the convocation on April 15, he said, have to be withdrawn as they are invalid because they have been signed by Vaswani, an unauthorised person. Every certificate is signed by the director and the chairman of the IRMA. 

 Dholakia, who sat on a dharna after being refused to attend the board meeting, said: ?I think justice has been done. There is a message in the judgment. And the message is that an institution must follow the process.?

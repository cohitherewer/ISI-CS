 Jharkhand drops land hot potato

 Ranchi, Oct. 25: Amid mounting opposition to land acquisition, the Jharkhand government is considering a new policy under which entrepreneurs wishing to set up units over a few hundred acres will have to make their own arrangements to get the site of their choice. 

 The government had earlier decided to make available the land required by entrepreneurs signing MoUs for setting up units in Jharkhand. But the plan has run into rough weather with questions being raised about the rehabilitation policy.

 On Sunday, villagers of Asanboni near Jamshedpur had driven away a team from Bhushan Steel, which had gone to scout for land. Today, over 3,000 people gathered at Tontoposhi in Seraikela-Kharsawan and said they would not let Tata Steel set up its new plant there.

 Since 2003, the government has signed 40 MoUs, some of them with big names like Tata Steel, Essar Steel, Mittal Steel and the Jindals. The entrepreneurs have applied for allotment of land to the deputy commissioners concerned, but the files are still doing the rounds of the secretariat. Sources said the government has not acquired any land so far.

 Industry department sources said the government has, therefore, decided in principle to ask all entrepreneurs whose requirement for land is a few hundred acres or below to make their own arrangements.

 The government believes the policy would help hasten the process of industrialisation. Entrepreneurs can now get in touch directly with individual land-holders in places where they intend to set up their units, settle the price and get the land transferred in their names, said an official.

 Details of all land required and arrangements made for purchase, including the names of the proposed sellers, would have to be communicated to the department before the signing of the memorandum, said the official.

 However, it would be the states responsibility to provide land to all big industrial units whose requirement runs into thousands of acres.

 Provisions of the Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act and the Santhal Parganas Tenancy Act strictly prohibit the sale of transfer of land to non-tribals and outsiders. Entrepreneurs wishing to set up units in the state would be free to purchase land from non-tribals, while in case of tribal plots, they would have to seek permission of the deputy commissioner.

 The proposal has angered entrepreneurs. Prem Mittal, secretary of the Federation of Jharkhand Chambers of Commerce and Industries, said he was opposed to the policy of apartheid. Where should small and medium scale industrial units go?

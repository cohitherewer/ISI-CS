 BJP stamps its foot over statue shift

 Lucknow, June 13: After the failed bid to galvanise Maharashtra over Mani Shankar Aiyars insult to Veer Savarkar last year, the BJP is threatening an agitation in Uttar Pradesh over another intellectual ancestor.

 Party leaders from across the state ? even some from Delhi ? left for Rampur town today after a statue of the late Deendayal Upadhyaya, a Jan Sangh ideologue, was removed from a street crossing.

 The Rampur district administration shifted the statue, installed nine years ago, from the Civil Lines area early this morning, apparently as part of an anti-encroachment drive.

 It brought BJP workers out on the roads in Rampur and Lucknow, threatening a violent agitation in a state where the party has been desperately looking for an issue after the Ayodhya dispute began to lose steam. 

 The district administration reacted by deploying a large police contingent in the western Uttar Pradesh town, about 350 km from Lucknow.

 The demonstrators called for state parliamentary affairs minister Azam Khans head, accusing him of making the statue vanish in his home town.

 Several BJP leaders from Delhi, including party national vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, made for Rampur. Naqvi accused Khan of trying to fan communal passions by this shameful move. He (Khan) had called Deendayal Upadhyaya a symbol of communalism and had demonstrated against the installation of the statue when it was put up in 1996, Naqvi said.

 BJP leader Kesrinath Tripathi appealed to chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav to sack Khan from his cabinet. Tripathi and Lalji Tandon, another senior BJP leader, were preparing to leave Lucknow for Rampur.

 Khan, a confidant of Mulayam Singh, said the statue had been removed as part of an anti-encroachment drive.

 The road on which it was installed is being broadened, the minister said. This road leads to the national highway. The local administration acted on a courts order to remove encroachments.

 The statue, he said, has been reinstalled at a site a few metres from its original position. It looks better in its new place, he said. The explanation failed to pacify the BJP. What was the need to remove it at 3 am then? Naqvi asked. The minister has failed to explain how the statue, located far from the main road, was causing congestion.

 A battery of Hindutva hardliners, led by former BJP state president Vinay Katiyar, have threatened a violent movement in Rampur. We are planning to march to Rampur if things dont change in a weeks time, Katiyar said in Lucknow.

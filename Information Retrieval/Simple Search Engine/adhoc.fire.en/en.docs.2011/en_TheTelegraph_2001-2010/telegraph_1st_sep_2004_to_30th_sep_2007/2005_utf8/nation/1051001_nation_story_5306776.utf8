 Forest law truce eludes Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today tried to evolve a consensus between supporters of the Scheduled Tribes (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill, 2005, and those who have been bitterly opposing it.

 However, no settlement was in sight till late at night and another meeting has been convened on October 21.

 Singh this evening summoned officials of the environment and forest ministry and the ministry of tribal affairs, along with Aruna Roy of the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan, economist Jean Dreze, wildlife activist Valmik Thapar and conservationist Ullhas Karanth for talks.

 The purpose of the meeting was to thrash out differences over the bill, said a spokesperson for the Prime Ministers Office.

 There are reports of a cabinet sub-committee having already asked the environment ministry to redraft the bill, though the government refused to confirm this.

 However, the PMO spokesperson said the government hopes to introduce the Bill in the winter session of Parliament. The differences over the bill, strongly voiced at todays meeting, are obviously too sharp to be resolved till then.

 The environment ministry is leading the side that has huge reservations about the bill, while Thapar urged the ministry to be more strident, warning that India would lose as much as 60 per cent of its forest cover if the bill is passed. The Left, on the other hand, has welcomed it along with activists like Roy and Dreze who have articulated their strong support for the Bill.

 The bill is the first comprehensive legislation that addresses the long-standing tribal demand for greater rights over forests. Among the more contentious provisions are:

 Regularisation of forestland 

 occupied by tribals before 1980 up to 2.5 hectares.

 Nistar (usufruct) 

 ownership rights to forest resources.

 Grazing rights, including 

 seasonal rights of nomads.

 Habitation rights for primitive 

 tribal groups.

 Conversion of forest villages 

 into revenue villages.

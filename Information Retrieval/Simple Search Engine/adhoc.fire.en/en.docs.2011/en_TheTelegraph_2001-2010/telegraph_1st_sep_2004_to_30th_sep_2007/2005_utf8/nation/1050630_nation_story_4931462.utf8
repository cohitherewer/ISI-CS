 Shimla/Kinnaur, June 29: The flood has ebbed, and so has the fear. Now its time for the healing touch.

 The reassuring words came from both Sonia Gandhi and Union home minister Shivraj Patil who today went on an aerial survey of areas affected by the fury of the now quieter Sutlej.

 The Congress chief, who is holidaying in the Himachal Pradesh capital, and Patil landed in Rekong Peo, the district headquarters of Kinnaur, about 250 km from here.

 She met families hit by the flood, vegetable and fruit growers who lost their produce to the swirling waters and local leaders and told them the Centre would help the state government tide over the damage.

 Parts of a national highway and over a dozen bridges were washed away and several houses submerged as the river, its water level swollen by an abnormal rise in temperature after a long spell of snowfall, raged through the state.

 Adequate arrangements will be made to transport the farm produce to the market and the damaged roads and bridges will be repaired within one month, Sonia told residents of Kinnaur, where 13 bridges have been washed away.

 Sonia, who returned to Shimla a little after noon, said arrangements have been made to restore the six damaged bridges.

 The Congress president, who also heads the central coalition, met tourists still stuck in Kinnaur. There are a number of tourists who are stranded. Some of them have been airlifted and some would be airlifted soon, she said.

 Chief minister Virbhadra Singh was among those who accompanied Sonia and Patil.

 Patil, who addressed a news conference in Shimla, said the worst is over. The government, he added, was in touch with Chinese authorities over future threats from the Pare Chu lake in neighbouring Tibet which was formed last year after a landslide blocked the Pare Chu river, a tributary of the Sutlej. A breach in the lake resulted in the rise in the water level of the Sutlej.

 Pictures released by the NRSA (National Remote Sensing Agency) show that the size of the lake has been reduced significantly after the breach, Patil said. We spoke to Chinese authorities on this matter. China has assured all possible help in this regard.

 In a recent MoU, India and China had agreed to exchange hydrological information, though the breach in the lake exposed the lack of co-ordination between the two. 

 There was no intimation from the Chinese government. Only the Lapcha post located on the Indian side noticed the flood and intimated Indian authorities, said a source.

 Patil refused to comment on the role of Chinese authorities. I leave this to the foreign minister, he said.

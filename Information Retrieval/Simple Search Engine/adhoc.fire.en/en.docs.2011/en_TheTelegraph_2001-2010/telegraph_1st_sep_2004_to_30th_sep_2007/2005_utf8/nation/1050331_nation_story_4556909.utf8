 ?Frivolous? PIL draws court fine

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has imposed 

 a fine of Rs 25,000 on three petitioners who had filed a 

 PIL urging a judicial probe into the police firing following 

 the collapse of the Damanganga bridge in 2003.

 Describing the PIL as ?false and frivolous?, a bench of Chief Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice S. A. Bobade asked the petitioners ? Mahesh Patel, Ibrahim Parker and Ramzan Parker ? on Wednesday to pay the fine within six weeks to the Centre.

 The high court said filing of such petitions should be discouraged as they spoil the very purpose and spirit of a PIL.

 The Centre?s counsel, Dipesh Mehta, told the court that a magisterial inquiry had already been conducted by the collector of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

 He also said the petitioners have been chargesheeted by the police for rioting in the same incident. Besides, if the police had not fired, there would have been more damage to government property and loss of life, Mehta said.

 The Damanganga bridge connecting the Moti Daman with the Nani Daman collapsed on August 28, 2003, killing 30 people. 

 Riot bodies to be exhumed

 Ahmedabad (PTI): The bodies of two Muslim 

 youths, slain in the Gujarat riots, will be exhumed to ascertain 

 the role played by BJP MLA Shankar Chaudhary in the killing, 

 director-general of police A.K. Bhargava said on Wednesday.

 Bhargava said the bodies will be exhumed to procure the bullets which were believed to have killed them. 

 ?We have to conduct detailed investigations before we take any action against the MLA, who is the prime accused,? he said. If the allegations levelled against the MLA are true, then the bullets will have marks which will match with his licensed weapon, Bhargava added.

 Chaudhary, along with 10 others, has been charged in a case of double murder, arson, rioting and loot that took place during the post-Godhra riots in the state.

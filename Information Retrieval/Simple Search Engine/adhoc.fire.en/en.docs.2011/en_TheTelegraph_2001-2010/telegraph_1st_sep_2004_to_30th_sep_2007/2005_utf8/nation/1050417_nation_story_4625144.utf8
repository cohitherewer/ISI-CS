 New Delhi, April 16: Pervez Musharraf may have to wait another day to impress Manmohan Singh, but the Prime Minister today admitted he was floored by the Pakistan President?s mother.

 ?We were impressed by the wisdom and wit of your most affectionate mother. She was so utterly charming that my wife said to her, ?I envy your daughter-in-law. She is so lucky to have a mother-in-law like you?,? the Prime Minister said in his banquet speech welcoming Musharraf, his wife Sehba and the rest of the Pakistani delegation.

 Musharraf?s mother Zarin, brother Javed and son Bilal were here last month on a private visit. 

 ?I believe your handsome son was quite a hit with young people here,? Singh said in an uncharacteristic speech. ?My wife and I went down memory lane with your mother and brother, talking of common friends and shared experiences.?

 The Prime Minister outlined his vision of South Asia and how the leadership of India and Pakistan can work together not only to bring permanent peace in the region but also to turn it into one of the most dynamic and prosperous areas in the continent.

 ?While I was born in what is now Pakistan and you were born here, both of us have come to occupy these high offices in our countries without lengthy careers in politics,? Singh said. ?Fate has placed on our shoulders the burden of a sacred responsibility that we are now required to bear.?

 The Prime Minister told the general: ?The people of both our nations expect us to play our due role, with sincerity of purpose and a commitment to our shared future.

 ?We cannot rewrite the past, but we can build a more secure future. A future that generates people?s trust and confidence in the political leadership in South Asia.? 

 Calling for a soft border, Singh pointed out that in the age of increasing globalisation, ?borders have lost meaning for much of the world?. ?The journey of peace must be based on a step-by-step approach, but the road must be travelled,? he said.

 The Prime Minister argued that a South Asia free of violence, poverty, disease and ignorance, and one where there is free movement of ideas, people, goods and services needs to become ?a reality?. 

 ?History beckons us to rise to the challenge and grasp the opportunities to create boundless prosperity in our ancient land. If we fail to grasp these opportunities our people will not excuse us for the economy of vision and courage.?

 The Prime Minister said the progress of the composite dialogue, which covers all outstanding issues between the two countries, was encouraging. So was the response to confidence-building measures put in place over 15 months.

 ?The bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad has tapped a latent reservoir of public support for stronger people-to-people contact between the two countries, especially among those living on either side of the Line of Control,? he said.

 The Prime Minister added that the peace process and the composite dialogue need to be carried forward with ?greater determination?. But in order to do so, ?acts of terrorism must be prevented and we must together fight the scourge of terrorism in our region?, he underlined.

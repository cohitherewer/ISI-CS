 EC in end-strike call

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Jan. 4: The Election Commission, concerned over the ongoing strike by state employees in Bihar, today asked this huge workforce to report for poll duty or be prepared to face the consequences.

 The threat included action under Section 134 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, whereby an employee?s refusal to join poll duty constitutes a cognisable offence, leading to arrest and subsequent penal action.

 An army of more than 50,000 employees is required to man polling booths during the first phase of the elections on February 3 when votes will be cast in 64 constituencies.

 The numbers will increase exponentially in the next two phases when 86 and 93 constituencies go to the polls on February 15 and 23. Two lakh people will be required to manage about 50,000 booths during the entire exercise in 243 constituencies and the poll panel intends to shift the employees across the phases.

 The ultimatum comes after appeals to call off the agitation since December 10 ? issued by chief secretary K.A.H. Subramaniam and chief electoral officer K.C. Saha ? did not evoke a favourable response from the striking employees.

 Saha today tried to underplay the impact and said ?some? employees were not attending the election training programmes being organised in the districts, while admitting that there were reports of the striking staff preventing their colleagues from participating in the special sessions.

 ?No employee has the right to refuse to join election duty under Section 28-A of the (RP) Act. This is like a last appeal to them and action will follow,? Saha said. The chief electoral officer said he had ?alternative arrangements? in mind in case the strike was not called off, but he refused to divulge details of the backup. 

 While the government has promised to consider their demands, the employees want ?concrete action?. The government?s problem is that with the model code already in operation, it cannot grant major sops to the employees. The strike began before the elections were announced. 

 The employees want the Election Commission to make an ?exception? in the poll code rules, so that they could reach an agreement with the state government. But the poll panel, too, cannot allow any major sops to be granted just before the elections.

 Saha said if the government came up with any proposal on ending the strike before the elections, it would be forwarded to the Election Commission for consideration. But sources in the government said it was a ?nearly impossible proposition? because the demands cannot be accepted at the moment.

 Representatives of the striking employees said they would not call off the strike no matter what the consequences were. ?Ours is a democratic way to protest. Our demands are genuine and long-pending. We are already on the path of agitation and no threats can push us back,? one of them said.

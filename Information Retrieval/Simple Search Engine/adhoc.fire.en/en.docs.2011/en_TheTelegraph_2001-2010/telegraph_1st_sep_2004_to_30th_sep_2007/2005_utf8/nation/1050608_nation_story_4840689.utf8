 Rowdies run riot at Arjun meet

 New Delhi, June 7: Academic churning and rowdy politics competed for space at a daylong seminar organised today by the human resource and development ministry to reform the school education system.

 While experts debated inside the Vigyan Bhavan auditorium, students and teachers loyal to the RSS destroyed whatever they could lay their hands on outside. Their anger was directed at HRD minister Arjun Singh for doing away with a curriculum that was brought in by their mentor, Murli Manohar Joshi.

 At the end of the day, Singh said a new syllabus and textbooks would be in place by the next academic year. The Central Advisory Board of Education formally approved at the meeting the new national curriculum framework drawn up by a 35-member steering committee under the National Council for Education, Research and Training.

 By July, we hope to complete all discussions on the curriculum framework. The framework is not the syllabus, he said. Once the discussions are over, experts will start working on the nitty-gritty of stitching up a new syllabus and authoring new textbooks.

 But today, at least for some time, vandalism pushed academics to the background when around 100 students led by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) ? the RSSs student wing ? went on a rampage at Vigyan Bhavan in the heart of the capital.

 It appeared a well-planned move orchestrated by Singhs predecessor, M.M. Joshi. Inside, education ministers from five BJP-run states walked out of the meeting after protesting against the move to bring back old textbooks authored by Left-liberal historians.

 Outside the hall but inside the building, the ABVP supporters and a clutch of teachers from Delhi University ran amok. About 2.30 pm, when Singh was inaugurating the meeting, the students climbed the gates and entered the area. Once they were inside the complex, they went up to the entrance and there was a scuffle with police, said an onlooker.

 The protesters then broke the glass panes on the doors and rushed inside the building, shouting Arjun Singh murdabad.

 In the absence of enough security personnel, the students went on a rampage. They broke flowerpots, overturned sofas and destroyed the cutlery spread on the tables where the invitees had lunch.

 One of the students threw a brass pot on the ground, stood on it and danced, said a bystander. By the time the police arrested them, enough damage had been done.

 The HRD minister said: The BJP ministers inside had their followers outside. They had nothing to do with education and only indulged in vandalism. The law will take due action against them.

 The school education reform seeks to make learning easier for the students. The curriculum framework throws up a range of suggestions dealing with every aspect of school education ? from syllabus and textbooks to examination reforms.

 Suggestions include simplifying the textbooks that will require the students to rely less on memory and more on understanding. History textbooks, for instance, may do away with the present system of periodisation under three chronological heads ? ancient, medieval and modern.

 Rebel blast to free comrades from cops

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 20: Suspected Naxalites triggered six landmine blasts in Malkangiri district this morning in a bid to free three comrades from police custody. There were no reports of casualties or injuries.

 The blasts occurred around 10.30 am near Kurut village under Kalimela police station when a joint CRPF and Orissa police team was conducting a combing operation in the area to track down Naxalites, said inspector-general of police (operations) Bidhu Bhusan Mishra.

 Early in the morning, a joint team of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh police raided a Naxalite camp on the border at Alkamore in Malakangiri. Two rebels were killed in the ensuing shootout.

 The police also arrested three Naxalites and recovered arms, provisions, photocopiers and typewriters from the camp, located deep inside the forest.

 The three arrested Naxalites were in the custody of the CRPF and state police team when the six landmines exploded simultaneously. The policemen were on motorcycles along with the trio.

 Mishra said the Greyhound-trained CRPF jawans ducked for cover but did not give the arrested Naxalites any chance to flee. 

 The Malkangiri district administration could not be contacted following a snag in the telecommunication system.

 A couple of days ago, director-general of police B.B. Mishra had claimed that the authorities in Orissa have to a large extent succeeded in checking Naxalite activities.

 Over the past few years, the Naxalites have established their presence in the southern parts of the state and carried out operations in Malkangiri, Rayagada,Gajapati, Ganjam and Koraput districts.

 Avalanche kills top cop

 PEMA LEYDA SHANGDERPA

 Gangtok, Sept. 26: The bodies of four climbers who had set out to scale the 6,829-metre Chhomu Yamu in Sikkim were recovered today by a team of the Indian Army. 

 The team included four members of Punjab police, of whom additional DGP and Everester Paras Moni Das and lady constable Nari Dhami are confirmed dead.

 Sub-inspector Inder Kumar is missing, additional district collector, north, Namrata Thapa, said over phone.

 Two instructors from the Sonam Gyatso Mountaineering Institute in Gangtok have also died. Dawa Sherpa and Dawa Wnagchuk Sherpa were also members of the subsidiary intelligence bureau.

 An army team from the 112 mountain brigade headquarters recovered the bodies amid bad weather today, inspector general of police S. D. Negi said. The bodies have been brought to Chaten in north Sikkim where post-mortem will be done before they are handed to their families.

 The expedition began on September 12 and was slated to return on October 5. Five members ? all porters ? did not proceed beyond the base camp at Dongkhum. 

 Two others, Passang Sherpa and Kulvinder Singh, were caught in the avalanche but escaped with injuries.

 The expedition was initially stopped from proceeding beyond Theng as the army had refused to acknowledge the validity of the permits issued by Sikkim police checkposts.

 The army insisted that the expedition members get a clearance from the Brigade Headquarters at Chaten. The issue was later resolved.The trek team leader, AGDP Das, had summitted Everest in 1996. He was a 1978-batch IPS officer from Assam and was vice-president of the Indian Mountaineering Federation.

 The heavy rain also set off several landslides, killing three members of a family in Rakshey in east Sikkim. While Karma Tshering Lepcha, his wife Zeptee Lepcha and eight-year-old son Dawa were washed away, their nine-year-old daughter Kipu survived.

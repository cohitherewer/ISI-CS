 Bhuttos follow Musharrafs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thanksgiving: Benazir and Zardari

 New Delhi, March 22: After the Musharrafs, it is the turn of the Bhuttos.

 Former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto will come to India on Thursday on a private visit. She will be accompanied by her husband Asif Zardari, who was recently released from prison.

 Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf?s mother, brother and son have already come to India on a private visit.

 Benazir, who is in self-imposed exile in Dubai, will fly down with Zardari on Thursday and take a connecting flight to Jaipur on her way to Ajmersharif. She will offer prayers there at Sufi saint Moinuddin Chisti?s dargah.

 Indications are Zardari, a keen polo player, may spend some time playing the sport in Jaipur.

 There is no indication so far of any official interaction between Bhutto and the Indian leadership.

 South Block sources maintained the former Pakistan Prime Minister will be here on a private visit; there are no engagements with foreign minister K. Natwar Singh or any other senior member of the UPA government. 

 This, however, does not rule out a last-minute meeting between the two sides.

 It is not clear whether Delhi will use the presence here of Bhutto, who is one of the most vocal supporters of democracy in Pakistan, to drive home a point or two to the Musharraf regime.

 The Pakistan President?s ?friendly? visit to India has been finalised for next month. There is every indication that apart from watching the last one-dayer between India and Pakistan in Delhi, he will also interact with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other leaders after he arrives here on April 16.

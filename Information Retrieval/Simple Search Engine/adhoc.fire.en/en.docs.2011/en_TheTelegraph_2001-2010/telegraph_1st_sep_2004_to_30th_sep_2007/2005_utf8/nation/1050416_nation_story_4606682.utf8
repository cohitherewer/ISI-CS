 Water scare in summer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gaya, April 15: Water bodies in the five districts of Magadh region are drying up fast, raising concerns ahead of summer.

 Thanks to the combined effect of less than 40 per cent rains last year, encroachment and poor maintenance of water bodies, a crisis looms large over a population of about 9 million people.

 Admitting the crisis, Gaya district magistrate Chaitanya Prasad told The Telegraph that a task force, headed by deputy development commissioner Rai Madan Kishore, has been set up for proper water management. The special team will hold weekly review meetings and take appropriate measures. ?We may have to requisition water tankers if the crisis further aggravates,? he said. 

 Gaya town is the worst affected, as the water table in the southern, central and western parts has depleted, leaving tube wells ? the main source of drinking water ? dry. In the Gewalbigha and AP Colony areas, even rig drilling has failed. 

 According to Ram Pyare Singh, director of the Bihar Jal Adhyan evamVikas Sansthan, the water infrastructure was developed in 1928, when the population of Gaya town was only 20 per cent of what it is now. The current population of the town has crossed the half million mark.

 Little has been done to address the problem, said sources. While Gaya town requires about 20 million gallons per day, the municipal water system supplies only about 5 million gallons. The other sources of water are open wells and hand pumps, which, too, are drying up. 

 The localities that have come up in the past three decades, including Nutan Nagar, Magadh Colony, Aliganj and New Karimganj, are not linked to the municipal supply system. Worse, they have to pay tax for the water they do not get from the civic body.

 Activists D.K. Jain and Lalji Prasad, president and general secretary respectively of the Janhit Parishad, have demanded that the responsibility of water supply in the Gaya Municipal Corporation area be given to the public health and engineering department of the state administration to help the town tide over the crisis.

 BJP five in Mulayam kitty

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Oct. 11: Five legislators expelled from the Uttar Pradesh BJP have formed a new party and declared support for the Mulayam Singh Yadav government.

 Allahabad High Court is due to pass a verdict any day now on a petition seeking to disqualify 40 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs who had defected to the ruling Samajwadi Party in 2003. If the judgment goes against the state government, reducing it to a minority, the new party could come in handy, not only by virtue of the five votes it brings but also by holding out the hope of a split in the BJP.

 The five members of Uttar Pradesh Kranti Dal met the governor yesterday and told him they had informed the Speaker, too. The party led by Manakeswar Saran Singh also comprises Kovid Kumar, Anil Paswan, Dayashankar and Narendra Verma.

 The formation of the new group is not in accordance with the provisions of the anti-defection law as they dont form two-thirds of the partys total number of MLAs (which is 83), said state BJP president Kesrinath Tripathi.

 He added that in this context, a legislator continues to be the member of the party on whose ticket he was elected even after being expelled from the party.

 The new party is banking on Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey, who is from the Samajwadi Party. If he recognises the group or keeps its official status hanging, it may tempt other BJP rebels to engineer a split in the party.

 Manakeswar Saran Singh said he has many sympathi- sers in the BJP and that they would soon cross over.

 The BJP expelled the five after they repeatedly defied its whip to openly support the Samajwadi Party government in the House. They had also been blaming the BJP brass for the partys condition in the state.

 The BJP has also suspended Moradabad MLA Sandip Agarwal. We are not going to tolerate anti-party activities, come what may, said a senior state leader.

 The Samajwadi Party has 195 members, including the 40 who defected from the BSP, in a House of 403. The BJP has 83, the BSP 66 and the Congress, which provides outside support to the ruling party, 16. The Rashtriya Lok Dal has 15 and there are 16 independents.

 Rent plan for state-run shops

 New Delhi: The Union urban development 

 ministry has decided to charge rents according to market 

 rates from Kendriya Bhandar outlets occupying government 

 flats in Delhi from November, reports our correspondent.

 The decision follows a recent Supreme Court stricture to the ministry for failing to evict VIPs overstaying in government accommodations. 

 The new rents will affect 42 Kendriya Bhandar outlets that the government plans to shift out over a period of three years. This will ensure the vacation of at least 24 government flats.

 Kendriya Bhandar was established in 1963 under the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions as a welfare project for central government employees. 

 Starting with an average sales of Rs 52 lakhs in 1963-64, the Kendriya Bhandar turnover reached Rs 2,871 crore in 1998-99 with a net profit of over Rs 3 crore. 

 But, it pays only Re 1 to the government as rent despite occupying prime properties in the capital. 

 Priya Dutt files papers

 Mumbai: Sunil Dutts daughter Priya 

 has filed her nomination as Congress candidate from the 

 North West constituency that the late actor-turned-politician 

 won five times since 1984, reports our special correspondent.

 The Shiv Sena decided to pitch senior leader Madhukar Sarpotdar, a two-time MP, against Priya. Sarpotdar, known for his staunch Hindutva views, would file his nomination after his party formally announces his candidature.

 Observers predict a landslide win for Priya, 

 based on two factors: the complete Congress dominance in 

 all six Assembly segments in the constituency, and the sympathy 

 wave after her fathers death.

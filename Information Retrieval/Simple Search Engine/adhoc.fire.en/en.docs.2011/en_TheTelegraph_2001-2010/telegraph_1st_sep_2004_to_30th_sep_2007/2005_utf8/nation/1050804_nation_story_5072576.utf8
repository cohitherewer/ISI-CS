 No passage for Bhutan refugees

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Mechi Bridge (India-Nepal border), Aug. 3: The group of 323 had one demand: Either we go to our homes in Bhutan or rot here to death. 

 But the Nepal and Indian governments would allow neither. They sent the homeless Bhutanese refugees back packing to their camps in Jhapa, around 40 km from here in eastern Nepal, which they had left this morning with all their belongings for good.

 In a major push-in organised by the Bhutan Gorkha National Liberation Front and supported by the Bhutanese Human Rights Commission, 323 Bhutanese refugees (from four months to 75 years of age), 157 of them women, tried to enter India this afternoon, possibly en route to Bhutan. 

 A strong presence of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Bengal police and the Royal Nepal Police thwarted their plans. The police detained nine persons.

 The refugees squatted for four hours, pleading to be let in till the Nepal police brought two trucks and a bus in which they were packed off. 

 We had specific information that refugees of Beldangi camps I, II and III would try to enter India, an SSB official said. 

 Given that the push-in was organised by the banned militant outfit (the Front), we were extra cautious, the official added.

 Todays push-in is being seen as the biggest since 1996 in which refugees had stayed put on the border for several months. 

 This time, the refugees, who had come with all their belongings ? from a rusted Janata stove to a crushed aluminium pitcher ? had the same plans till it was foiled completely.

 Are we asking for too much by wanting to go to our homeland? said Gopi Maya Gurung, clutching her four-year-old daughter Yamuna.

 Zahira lobs ?bias? slur on SC panel

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Zahira Sheikh 

 New Delhi, April 20: Zahira Sheikh, the key witness in the Best Bakery massacre who has turned hostile, today accused a Supreme Court committee of ?bias?.

 A bench presided by Justice Arijit Pasayat declined to hear Zahira?s appeal against the apex court?s high-power committee headed by registrar-general B.M. Gupta, which is probing the allegations and counter-allegations being traded between Zahira and social activist Teesta Setalvad almost everyday.

 The disclosures of the 20-year-old girl, whose relatives were among the 14 slaughtered in the bakery during the post-Godhra riots, had prompted the Supreme Court to order a retrial and transfer the case to Maharashtra. But in a sudden turnaround in November, she accused Setalvad ? who had helped her approach the Supreme Court ? of pressuring her to implicate ?innocent? people. Teesta alleged that Zahira was taking bribes to hush up the case.

 In her latest application, Zahira has alleged that the Gupta committee was favouring Teesta and so the hearings should be transferred to a formal court.

 The Gupta committee today said that since Zahira ?is not as matured, educated and literate as Teesta Setalvad is?, it would orally examine her but would seek written replies from the activist. 

 This, Zahira?s counsel Pran Nath Lekhi argued, amounts to violating ?equality of approach?. Lekhi said it was unfair that Teesta was being given time to file her reply while questions were being put to Zahira for instant response.

 After the committee rejected the plea, Zahira moved the apex court, seeking the transfer of the probe to a formal court. But Justice Pasayat said: ?Under no circumstances, we will allow the proceedings of the committee to be adjourned. Whatever grievance you have could be heard after the committee submits its report to the court.? 

 The committee has asked Teesta to reply to several questions pertaining to the Best Bakery case, including ?whether she has seen/observed Madhu Srivastava and Chandrakanta alias Bittu Srivastava meeting/talking or dealing in any manner with Zahira or any of her family members?.

 Zahira has been accused of changing her statements after being paid money at the instance of Madhu, a Gujarat BJP legislator, and his cousin Bittu.

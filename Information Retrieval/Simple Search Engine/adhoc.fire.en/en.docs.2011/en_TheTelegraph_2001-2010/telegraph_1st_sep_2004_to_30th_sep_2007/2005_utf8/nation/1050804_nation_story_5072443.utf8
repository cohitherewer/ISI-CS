 PM advice to labour: Hold your fire

 Singh: Shield for investors

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today told Left unions that foreign investors should not be made captive to labour demands as this could make them feel India is an uncertain place to invest in.

 Singhs comment came days after striking Honda Motorcycle workers clashed with police in the industrial suburb of Gurgaon. Though the workers later reached a deal with the Japanese firms management, the face-off left investors thinking if more militant trade unionism was in the offing.

 The Prime Minister, who met the trade union delegation led by Gurudas Dasgupta to resolve a four-year-old labour dispute between Maruti and 1,000-odd sacked workers, promised he would ensure labour laws are followed by all companies. Trade union is a part of our social life and their legitimate demands would be respected, he is reported to have told the team.

 According to those present at the meeting, Singh said the government needed time to go into disputes and sort them out and underlined that unions should not precipitate any action which could make investors jittery.

 Surprisingly, Dasgupta, who was at the scene of the Honda protest, told Singh: We, too, are in favour of FDI (foreign direct investment). He said Left unions would not do anything to vitiate the atmosphere but stuck to his demand that the law of the land should be upheld in all matters, including labour disputes with multinationals. 

 Singh has no problem with this argument. But his message to the Left, said those who were present, was clear ? do not go on the warpath and avoid production loss as it would be counter-productive.

 The Left, of course, follows this philosophy in Bengal, where it rules, and in the steel belt in Orissa-Jharkhand-Chhattisgarh. After years of militant trade unionism through the 1960s and 1970s, Left unions have reappraised their stance and now work to help the industry remain healthy in the belt while expanding their base and securing benefits for workers through negotiations.

 All the steel giants in the east ? Tata, Sail and Vizag steel ? have had cosy relations with Left-led unions. The Tatas have never faced a strike since Independence, while Sail has faced just one strike in one unit ? the Durgapur-based Alloy Steel Plant ? which was resolved quickly.

 Left unions have always been extremely cooperative and we have always been able to increase productivity in steel plants without problems, said George Thomas, a former Sail executive director, who is now a director with rival steel-maker Ispat.

 Steel executives say their industrial relations model, which involves consultations across the industry round the year, has been an excellent way to let off steam and yet get constructive work done.

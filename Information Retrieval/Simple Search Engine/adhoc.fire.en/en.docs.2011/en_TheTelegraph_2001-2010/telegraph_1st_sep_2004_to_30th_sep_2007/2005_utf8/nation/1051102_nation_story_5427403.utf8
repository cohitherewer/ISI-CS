 Poll code FIR slapped on Rabri

 Rabri Devi

Patna, Nov. 1: The Rashtriya Janata Dal has a new reason to continue its attack on the Election Commission: an FIR has been registered against former chief minister Rabri Devi for allegedly violating the model code of conduct.

 Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadavs wife had given a shawl to a woman near Madhubani during an election meeting, official sources said.

 The Election Commission has registered a series of cases against politicians, most of them from the RJD, for violation of the model code. On most occasions, the RJD has denied violating the code and accused the poll panel of victimising its leaders.

 This is the second case of code violation registered against Rabri Devi in the current round of electioneering. An FIR was lodged last month in Vaishali district because she went to file her nomination with a fleet of over two dozen vehicles.

 She has also been served a notice by the Vaishali returning officer for not submitting proper daily expenditure statements.

 The latest case was registered yesterday at Rajnagar police station of Madhubani by executive magistrate A.K. Singh. Rabri Devi had given the shawl to the woman at Bhatsimri village on Sunday.

 According to the model code, this amounts to inducement of a voter. During the February elections, a similar case was lodged against Laloo Prasad after he distributed cash among villagers on the outskirts of Patna. The episode was telecast by a TV channel.

 The RJD has been targeting the poll panel for a number of reasons in the past few weeks. The Congress, its ally, has recently joined in the attack.

 The RJD initially said insistence on photo identity cards as a mandatory requirement for voting would deprive poor electors from exercising franchise. After it was relaxed, the party said deployment of central forces at polling booths would scare voters.

 Almost all other parties have come out in praise of the Election Commission for ensuring fair and violence-free polling in Bihar.

 State BJP chief Sushil Kumar Modi said: The RJD is crying foul because its earlier mantra of winning polls by rigging and booth management has been totally checked.

 Now, the RJD and the Congress are bent on lowering the dignity of a constitutional body like the Election Commission. The prospect of losing power has made them desperate and totally irrational, Modi added.

 Tech school training for power boards

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Calcutta, Feb. 6: The Union power ministry has roped in IIT Kharagpur to help improve the commercial performance of state electricity boards and reform the power distribution structure in the country.

 Supported by the US Agency for International Development, the initiative ? for which the oldest Indian Institute of Technology is tying up with Washington-based consulting major Core International ? is aimed at building capacity and skill sets among distribution utility personnel.

 ?We will conduct training programmes to impart the best technical and management practices among people involved in power distribution. The objective will include both reduction in distribution losses and improvement in quality of supply and service,? said A.K. Sinha, professor in the electrical engineering department.

 Expertise will also be drawn from the industrial engineering, management, humanities and social science departments for the training programme, which will cover around 25,000 people. The institute will also invite private power utilities to nominate their personnel.

 ?The Electricity Act of 2003 has spelt out its goal of meeting power on demand objective by 2012. This will mean electrification of all the villages and the remotest of areas,? added Sinha.

 But according to him, meeting the objective will be easier said than done as the distribution system has a lot of problems and in some cases, the losses are as high as 40 per cent of the total power generation. 

 ?There is an urgent need to initiate reform measures to make the system efficient,? added Sinha explaining the trigger behind the initiative. 

 An efficient system will minimise the losses of the SEBs and generate profits, which in turn will provide incentives for the private sector to enter the industry, observed Sinha. As part of its power sector reform plans, the government is separating power generation from its transmission and distribution and inviting private players to take part in the industry.

 ?Our effort will be to impart both technical and managerial inputs and equip the officials to run the system in an efficient manner. The courses will run in a continuous manner,? explained K. Chakravarti, dean, Vinod Gupta School of Management. 

 The 11-year-old B-school will focus on developing managerial and professional expertise among the trainees, to be drawn from engineering functions.

 The detailed training modules and schedules will be worked out in detail after holding meetings with resource persons from Core International, who will be visiting the campus next week. 

 ?Depending on the requirements of the personnel, we will be offering programmes of various duration, ranging from two-week refresher programmes to a six- month intensive course. We intend to to kick off the programmes this summer,? said Sinha.

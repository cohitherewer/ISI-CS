 Gutka barons get breather

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: Bombay High Court today deferred hearing the petitions of gutka barons Rashiklal Dhariwal and Jagdish Joshi till February 21. The two are challenging the non-bailable warrants issued against them. 

 Mumbai police had issued the warrants in the last week of December, alleging that the businessmen, who are in Dubai now, have close links with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. 

 But the high court bench of Justices R.M.S. Khandeparkar and P.V. Kakade extended their order till February 21 and restrained the police from executing the warrants against Dhariwal and Joshi. 

 Yesterday, the court hauled up Mumbai police, asking them to explain why non-bailable warrants were issued. CBI counsel Raja Thakre and prosecutor Purnima Kantharia on behalf of Mumbai police sought time to file their replies to the petitions and urged for an adjournment till February 21. 

 Dhariwal and Joshi, owners of the Manikchand group and Goa Gutka respectively, have been in Dubai since October and have ignored the summons issued by the police. 

 Both have told the special court ? which is also trying two alleged Dawood henchmen for extortion and smuggling gutka manufacturing machinery to Karachi ? that they will be here in March.

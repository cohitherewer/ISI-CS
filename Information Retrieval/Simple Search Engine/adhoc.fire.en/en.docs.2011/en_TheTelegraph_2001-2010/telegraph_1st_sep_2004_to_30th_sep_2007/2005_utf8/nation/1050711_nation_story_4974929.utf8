The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Temple gang of four pops up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 A demonstration at New 

 Delhi 's Jantar Mantar against 

Ayodhya, July 10: At least 

 four other persons had colluded with the militants who stormed 

 the disputed masjid-mandir complex here last Tuesday, investigators 

 have learnt.

 The quartet had made an advance inspection of the site between 6 and 7.30 on the morning of the blast. The accomplices of the group of five who died in an exchange of fire with the security forces might have been from Ayodhya or from Akbarpur, 60 km away from where the attackers made their final journey.

 Residents of colonies adjacent to the complex told the special task force probing the incident that they had seen the four associates of the militants. 

 The four had come on two motorcycles. Even during the blast, they were waiting in a lane. After the militants began to fire, they left, said an eyewitness. Kam ho gaya (our job is over), they said while escaping.

 Police suspect that the militants lived in a village in Akbarpur where they spent two days before coming to Ayodhya, but were in touch with their agents in the temple town itself. 

 Earlier, they had visited Delhi and Lucknow from where they purchased three bags. They also bought a SIM card for their cellphone in neighbouring Faizabad and produced a ration card and driving licence of a person in Amritsar that turned out to be fake. This SIM card was later removed from the mobile that was seized by the police.

 Sources said Rehan, whose car was apparently commandeered by the militants, was still a suspect. The police have found out that Rehan had lived in Saudi Arabia for nine years. We are examining the NRI bank account and his other accounts, senior superintendent of police Avinash Chandra said.

 Rehans jeep was financed by a bank, police sources said, adding that he repaid the loan in one go. 

 After being detained by the police, Rehan was taken to the temple at Rinmochan Ghat on a number of occasions to recount the events. 

 The militants had introduced themselves as devotees and said they wanted to offer prayers at this temple. They hired Rehans jeep for Rs 1,300 and told him that they wanted him to take them to Lucknow after their visit to the temple, Chandra added. 

 The police have stumbled on some vital information on the attackers, but it would take some more time to draw conclusions, he said.

 His statement came in the backdrop of reports that the sleuths had received some clues from Jammu and Kashmir police on the identities of the attackers. Other clues have come from Ahmedabad.

 Although we have clinching evidence on who carried out the blast and the subsequent raid, we have to keep mum and tread carefully to avoid making any mistakes, Chandra said.

 Travelling in Kashmir, home minister Shivraj Patil struck the same note of caution. We do have some information but it will be too premature to disclose it.

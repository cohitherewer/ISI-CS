 Lucknow, July 23 (PTI): The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court hearing the Ayodhya title suits has directed the Archaeological Survey of India to close the eight open trenches at the disputed site by filling them with river sand.

 The special full bench comprising Justices S. Rafat Alam, Khem Karan and Bhanwar Singh passed the order yesterday on an application moved by the ASI praying for the same.

 The bench directed the ASI to take necessary steps to close the trenches after spreading alkathene/polythene sheets of good quality up to the lowest level covering the structures. The bench, however, ordered that the top of the trenches be covered with clay or mud.

 Test-fire pact sealed, spotlight on visas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Islamabad, Oct. 3: After months of talks and exchange of drafts, India and Pakistan today inked a pact making it mandatory to inform each other before test-firing ballistic missiles.

 Each country will intimate the other at least 72 hours in advance. Neither will test-fire the missiles within a distance of 40 km from the Line of Control or the international boundary.

 The agreement entails that both countries provide each other advance notification of flight tests that it intends to undertake of any surface-to-surface ballistic missile, a short statement said.

 So far, the two sides would tell each other informally, which left scope for differences on how early either was intimated or from what distance the missile was test-fired.

 India has also proposed signing an MoU on measures to reduce the risks of accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons under the control of both countries.

 This mornings agreement was signed by foreign secretary Shyam Saran and his Pakistan counterpart Riaz Mohammed Khan. Foreign ministers K. Natwar Singh and Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri were also present.

 An agreement to establish a communication link between the Indian Coast Guard and Pakistan Maritime Security Agency was also signed. A. K. Singh and Rear Admiral Moshid Bakhtiyar signed the document. Tomorrow, India will present proposals to relax the existing visa and consular regimes. 

 One proposal includes a visit visa for six months, instead of three, with a maximum stay of 90 days at a stretch. Two more visits can be made in the remaining days.

 Another talks of a six-month multiple-entry visa for businessmen and student visas for the duration of the course of study and specifying the institution of study.

 A third proposes exchange of lists of nationals in each others custody on January 1 and July 1 every year.

 Another suggests that arrest of each others nationals should be notified to the other side in a month and consular access given in three months.

 A fifth proposes raising the number of religious sites that pilgrims can visit.

 The proposal for prior intimation of missile tests was first made in the Lahore Declaration between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif in February 1999. But it was pushed to the backburner after the Kargil war and picked up by India only last year.

 An agreement was reached at last months talks between the foreign secretaries after much bargaining. It was then decided that the pact would be signed when Kasuri and Natwar meet.

 The link between the Coast Guard and the Pakistani Maritime Security Agency will help keep tabs on straying fishermen, smugglers and pirates.

 Since the International Maritime Boundary Line with Pakistan has not yet been ratified by the two countries, many fishermen from both sides stray into each others territorial waters, the Indians said in a short statement.

 The communication link will lead to early exchange of information between the two sides regarding apprehended fishermen who inadvertently stray into each others territories.

 Both countries agreed in December 2004 to immediately intimate arrests of fishermen, the statement said. 

 The communication link will facilitate the early intimation, which in turn would lead to an early beginning of the process of providing consular access, nationality verification and repatriation.

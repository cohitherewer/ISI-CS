 New Delhi, Sept. 21: Before Sharad Pawar left for Calcutta by the evening flight, he was closeted with Sonia Gandhi for half an hour.

 The meeting triggered speculation that Pawar might again throw his hat in the ring for the post of BCCI president. 

 It is widely believed that the Congress president can influence the votes of eight to 10 members ? under a third of the total votes ? who belong to the party.

 He has boarded the flight to Calcutta along with Praful Patel to attend the two-day meeting of the BCCI general body. Now you draw the conclusions, Nationalist Congress Party general secretary D.P. Tripathi said, when asked if his party chief was planning to contest.

 Till yesterday, NCP leaders were non-committal even about whether Pawar would attend the AGM. 

 He was believed to have deferred his plans to travel to Calcutta on Tuesday.

 Congress general secretary Ambika Soni, who met Sonia soon after Pawar did, confirmed the meeting but did not reveal what it was about. Other Congress leaders, including Sonias political secretary Ahmad Patel, were also tight-lipped. 

 But sources close to Pawar said the discussion was all about cricket politics. The Congress has conveyed to us that, as a party, it will not oppose Pawars candidate for the BCCI presidents post, a source said.

 Would that mean Pawar, who lost last years contest to Haryana Congress leader Ranbir Singh Mahendra because of outgoing BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiyas casting vote, will force a contest this time? 

 There are some legal and technical matters to be sorted out before it becomes clear whether or not he will contest, a source said. 

 The tentativeness is understandable. Confident of winning, Pawar had run a high-profile campaign last year but it came to nothing. 

 His calculations of winning Congress votes had also misfired. While some Congress members in the board supported him, others did not. Moreover, the incumbent Mahendra is a Congress leader and a legislator in Haryana. Since he had yet to assess his chances this time, the NCP leader is keeping a low profile.

 But his loyalists confirmed that Pawar is eager to turn the tables on his rivals in the BCCI boardroom and has been lobbying support quietly.

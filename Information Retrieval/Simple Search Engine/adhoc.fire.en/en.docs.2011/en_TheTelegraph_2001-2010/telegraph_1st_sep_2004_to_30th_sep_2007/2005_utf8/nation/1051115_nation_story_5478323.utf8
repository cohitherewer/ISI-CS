 Squatter VIPs drive govt up the wall

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: The Centre today said it was having a major problem evicting politicians and well-connec-ted people who were wrong- fully occupying government bungalows.

 In its action taken report filed before the Supreme Court, the Centre expressed helplessness that politicians continue to stay (in the bungalows) even after ceasing to be ministers.

 In the management of higher type bungalows of the general pool, the major problem that arises is that sitting members of Parliament, upon ceasing to be ministers, do not vacate the general pool houses allotted to them by virtue of their having been ministers, the urban development ministry said.

 It added that MPs on ceasing to be ministers are entitled to accommodation only from respective house pools (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, as the case may be) and not from the general pool meant for Union ministers and other top posts.

 The apex court had recently asked the Centre to throw out Buta Singh from his Delhi government bungalow as he is now the governor of Bihar. The Centre has replied that a letter dated August 8 was sent to him to vacate the accommodation.

 In the affidavit, filed through solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati, the Centre said a few more cases of unauthorised occupation have been detected on a closer examination.

 It submitted a list of 32 additional cases of unauthorised occupation of bungalows, including former ministers Ashok Pradhan and Sukhbir Singh Badal, former chief of Punjab police K.P.S. Gill and Youth Congress leader Maninderjit Singh Bitta.

 The Centre said bungalows were also wrongfully occupied by the families of the late Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Sayed Mir Qasim, and the late actor-turned-politician, Sunil Dutt.

 Official communication had already been sent by the urban development ministry to the unauthorised occupants to vacate their houses so that they could be allotted to new ministers, the affidavit said.

 On October 24, the Supreme Court had suggested that all those wrongfully occupying government bungalows should be thrown out and eviction proceedings immediately started in cases where action has yet to be taken.

 The Centre had said that apart from Buta Singh, CPM leader Harkishen Singh Surjeet, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, BJP leaders Rajnath Singh and Jaswant Singh, and three Congress general secretaries were among the defaulters. In all, there are 465 such cases.

 The CPM had subsequently said Surjeet would continue to stay on in his bungalow as the party was entitled to government accommodation.

 Earlier, the court had directed the Centre to furnish a list of unauthorised occupants of government quarters in Delhi and other parts of the country. The matter will come up for hearing on Wednesday.

 Car relief in court order

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 15: There is light at the end of the tunnel for citizens who have to ?sacrifice? their vehicles at the altar of elections.

 In a judgment that could serve as an eye-opener for the authorities, Patna High Court today ordered the Kishanganj district administration to return a Mahindra Scorpio to its owner Shambhu Goel, a businessman.

 A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai passed the order while hearing an intervening petition filed by Goel?s father .M. Agrawal. Polling was held in Kishanganj today, five days after the administration impounded the vehicle.

 A citizens? body of West Champaran recently complained to the Election Commission and President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam about ?the indiscriminate seizure of private vehicles causing serious inconvenience to the people?. 

 The high court had ruled in 1998 that the state ?should take over no private vehicle meant for personal use, for electoral or any other reason?.

 ?Then Chief Justice B.P. Singh passed the historical order after some lawyers too had to part with their vehicles for the elections. Uninhibited use of private vehicles is a constitutional right of citizens,? M.P. Gupta, counsel for the Indian Medical Association, said.

 ?Despite the court order, the state administration continues to seize private vehicles at will during every election, which is a violation of citizen?s rights,? he added.

 In West Champaran?s Bettiah, a forum of prominent citizens ? including journalists, lawyers, professors and human rights activists ? said in its petition to the poll panel and the President that the seizure of vehicles ?virtually paralyses the lives of citizens?.

 ?The administration impounds public as well as private vehicles during every election. It is the exercise of unlimited powers without a human face,? said Victor Henry Thakur, Bishop of the Bettiah diocese.

 Fear of seizure, the bishop added, forces many transport operators to keep their vehicles off the roads, which causes a lot of inconvenience. 

 ?We want the authorities to ensure that the public does not suffer in the name of elections,? he said.

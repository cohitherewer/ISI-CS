 Rice ruckus 

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, Dec. 21: Twenty-nine Congress legislators, including leader of Opposition Mahendra Karma, were suspended from the Chhattisgarh Assembly today for flouting House rules by trooping into the well.

 Speaker Prem Prakash Pandey decided to act after the MLAs, who had been agitating over the multi-crore-rupee Kunkuri scam for the past three days, could not be pacified.

 After question hour, they demanded a CBI probe into the scam, which relates to alleged shortage of over 26,000 quintals of rice meant for the public distribution system from the government godown in Kunkuri in Jashpur district.

 Raising slogans, they demanded the resignation of chief minister Raman Singh and food minister Hemchand Yadav before entering the well. Revenue minister Brijmohan Agrawal said the Speaker should ask the marshals to remove the agitating members from the House as they were disrupting proceedings. The House had been adjourned twice today.

 But Pandey refused, saying it was up to the protesting members to decide if they were maintaining decorum. When they did not relent, the Speaker announced their suspension.

 The MLAs continued their protest even after they were suspended and sat on dharna till the end of the days proceedings.

 Earlier, Karma said truckloads of rice were seized yesterday in the Surajpur area of Sarguja district which revealed that there were large-scale irregularities in rice distribution.

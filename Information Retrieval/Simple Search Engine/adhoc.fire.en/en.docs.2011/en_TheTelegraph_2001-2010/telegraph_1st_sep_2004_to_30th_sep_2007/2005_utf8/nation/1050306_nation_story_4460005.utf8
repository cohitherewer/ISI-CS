 Sony wins cricket overseas rights

New Delhi (PTI): The Board of Control for Cricket in India 

on Saturday awarded Sony Entertainment Television the satellite rights for the 

India-Pakistan cricket series, paving the way for millions of fans abroad to watch 

the matches live.

 Sony was given the rights for $11.5 million, board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra said.

 ?I was authorised by the BCCI?s working committee earlier this week to take the decision on the satellite rights. Since Sony was the highest bidder, it was given the rights,? he said.

 The decision came a few days after the committee of the BCCI, which had met here on March 1, had awarded the production rights to UK-based Trans World International.

 The cricket board had then put on hold a decision on the satellite rights, giving Mahendra the authority to deal with it.

 Sony bagged the rights barely three days before the first of the three Tests gets underway in Mohali on Tuesday. Pakistan is scheduled to play three Tests and six One-Day Internationals during their 50-day tour of India ? the first since 1999.

 A flood relief operation: Eye of storm

 New Delhi, May 6: The Centre has asked the Bihar administration to involve the states accountant-general in its inquiry into the alleged flood relief scam.

 A senior home ministry official said it expected the accountant-general to take up test cases of fund disbursal and relief operations elsewhere to determine if the irregularities involving former Patna district magistrate Gautam Goswami were the exception or the rule in Bihar. 

 ?Questions have only been raised about the expenditure of Rs 17 crore by the Patna district magistrate. Nearly Rs 400 crore was spent in relief and rehabilitation operations in the entire state,? a home ministry official said.

 Sources said the directive was sent to the Bihar administration after the state submitted a preliminary report on the scam to the home ministry that referred to evidence indicating irregularities in the manner Goswami had released the money.

 The state administration has admitted that according to its records, a large sum of unaccounted for money was released from the DMs office. Records show the presence of bills for only Rs 7.7 crore while payments of over Rs 17 crore were unaccounted for. 

 The first indication that something was amiss in the relief operations coordinated by Goswami came in November last year when suppliers approached the government to clear dues and did not acknowledge the payment of Rs 17 crore. 

 Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam then ordered an inquiry by the divisional commissioner.

 A detailed report, expected in the coming weeks, is likely to come up with a clear picture of what happened but officials in Delhi contend that it was unusual for Goswami to directly make payments to Baba Sathya Sai Industries. 

 Goswami has defended this decision, arguing that he gave orders for direct payment to BSSI only on a written authorisation from the state corporation.

 Government officials in Delhi, however, contend that it was improper to make direct payments, with or without authorisation from the corporation. The arrangement between the state corporation and BSSI should not have been of any concern to the state government. 

 There was no reason for cheques to be made out to BSSI directly. Also, in cases where a large number of cheques were to be made out to a particular party and abbreviations were being used, it would have been proper for the official concerned to notify the bank on what the abbreviations stood for.

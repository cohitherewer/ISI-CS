 Call centre death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 6: A senior manager of a call centre was found shot dead inside his car just outside the north gate of the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus this morning.

 Kaushik Mohan Das, 29, an employee of the Wipro Spectramind call centre in Nehru Place, was found slumped in the driver?s seat of his Baleno by police who were alerted by security guards posted at the JNU gate. 

 While foul play was not ruled out, the police said initial investigations indicate that it is a case of suicide rather than murder. ?Preliminary investigations suggest that it is a case of suicide as the car had been locked from inside and a pistol had also been recovered in the vehicle,? said deputy commissioner, Southwest district, Deependra Pathak.

 Das, a resident of Greater Kailash II in south Delhi, was the younger son of K. Mohan Das, who runs an export business. A dropout from Manipal College in Sikkim, where he was studying engineering, Kaushik had been living in Delhi for the last four to five years.

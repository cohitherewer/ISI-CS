 US to India, for miracle cure

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Feb. 15: Better a ?miracle patient? in India than a guinea pig in the US. At least, Robert Walter Beeney thinks so.

 The 64-year-old real estate consultant from San Fransisco flew all the way to India with his bad hip to get it fixed at Apollo Hospitals in Hyderabad.

 Instead of the usual hip replacement surgery, Beeney went in for the relatively newer ?surface replacement surgery? done in this hospital, in which the original hip and femur (thigh bone) are preserved and only their surfaces replaced.

 Not that India has stolen a march over Big Brother US in healthcare, though. The Anatomic Surface Replacement hip system used for the operation is manufactured in the US itself but the surgery technique has yet to get clearance from the Food and Drug Administration.

 ?I am feeling my hip is as good as new,? a delighted Beeney said today. ?From a miracle patient, I have turned into a miracle tourist,? he said, having visited the Taj Mahal and Jaipur with wife Tilly only 12 days after the surgery.

 Beeney said he had opted for India because he had found out on the Net that Dr Vijay Bose of Chennai had performed the maximum number of such operations.

 ?I chose to come to Hyderabad as a friend in San Fransisco told me it would be the best place to recuperate because of the good weather. And he was absolutely right,? Beeney beamed.

 Had he got the surgery done in the US, he would have become a guinea pig for a clinical trial by an inexperienced doctor, he said. Besides, the expenses would have been almost four times the $6,600 he had shelled out in India. ?In the US, the same procedure, even as part of a clinical trial, would have cost me $24,000 whereas in the UK, it would have cost ?12,000.?

 Beeney was operated on on January 27 by a team headed by Dr Bose. Explaining the procedure, Dr Jayaramchandar Pingle said the hip was not replaced in this form of surgery.

 ?In this system, which is relatively new, the patient?s original head and neck of femur are preserved and only their surfaces are replaced with metal-on-metal articulation.

 ?With the use of very advanced metallurgy in the hip device, wear and tear is reduced to a bare minimum, only a fraction,? he said.

 Sangita Reddy, the hospital?s executive director, said the surgery on Beeney had opened up a new chapter for the Indian medical and healthcare industry. 

 ?Six or seven years ago, we announced there was tremendous opportunity in the area of medical tourism. Today, about 7 per cent of our annual turnover comes from international patients,? she said.

 She said patients came in from Africa, West Asia, Canada and the Far East but Beeney?s case was significant as he had chosen India after thorough research.

 If the $1.7 trillion US healthcare sector wished to outsource patients, India was more than equipped to handle them, she said.

 SMS steam for clean-up

 Raveena: No slums, please

 Mumbai, March 2: Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh may have come up against a wall of resistance from his party, but several of Mumbai?s eminent citizens are backing his drive to clean up the city that has claimed at least 80,000 hutments.

 One of them is Raveena Tandon, who is spearheading an SMS campaign to gather support for the cause. 

 ?Please do your bit as a concerned citizen to make Mumbai a cleaner, healthier city,? her message on behalf of the Lokhandwala Complex Environmental Action Group says.

 The actor told a news agency today that she had earlier ?planned a signature drive?. ?But since I am in the last month of pregnancy, I could not do so and have begun SMSing people.?

 A public uproar against the demolition drive had seen Deshmukh summoned to Delhi last month by his party chief Sonia Gandhi. She asked him to go slow.

 Referring to reports that he had agreed to spare post-1995 slums, the chief minister yesterday said that he never made such a promise. Over 55 per cent of Mumbai?s population lives in slums.

 Last month, a statement of a forum, Concerned Citizens of Mumbai, signed by former cabinet secretary B.G. Deshmukh, adman Alyque Padamsee, and activist Gerson Da Cunha, demanded that the slums must go. 

 ?We agree that the government cannot evict people without making alternative arrangements. But the slums are illegal,? Da Cunha said.

 But others such as actor-activist Shabana Azmi want the ?inhuman? drive to stop immediately. She said the government was duty-bound to upgrade the slums and provide basic sanitation.

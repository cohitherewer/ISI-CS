 New Delhi, April 26: The past rubbed shoulders with the future, the exotic east shared the ramp with western minimalism ? the week that went by saw fashion in all its forms, with influences drawn from the world over.

 But on the final day of India Fashion Week 2005, it was time to go back to the basics with Delhi-based designer Rajesh Pratap Singh. With the Indian schoolgirl as the inspiration, Singh presented perhaps the most down-to-earth and elegantly simple collection of the fashion week. 

 A stainless steel tiffin box placed on every seat greeted each member of the audience, along with a CD reading ?Convent educated? on the cover.

 While this gave away the theme to be unveiled, the contents of the box ? a pair of earplugs wrapped in a paper with ?If the sound bites? written by hand in one tier and a single pack of condom covered in a chit reading ?healthy body healthy mind? in the other ? kept the crowd guessing.

 Audio-visuals of students in uniform, classrooms, blackboards and school assembly brought the theme firmly in focus. 

 Tunics, puff-sleeved shirts, short frocks, long dresses, trousers, three-quarter pants and jackets and skirts of various shapes and textures made up the silhouettes in fine breezy fabrics. The palette almost totally focused on the basic black and white, with a little bit of dull pinks and blues creeping in towards the very end.

 Minimalistic to the core, the silhouettes had touches of embroidery with white on white and crude cotton knits with metallic silver prints. The models sported minimal make-up with their hair tied up in ponytails and feet mostly adorned by white socks and black school shoes.

 ?The collection is inspired by the Indian small-town schoolgirl with the serious feel without the perverse naughty connotation with which it?s often dealt,? said Singh.

 But the condom in the tiffin box and some inside-out constructions begged to differ. The designer, however, stood by his focus. 

 ?It has influences of the sixties? post-French revolution period when the missionaries came to India and set up the convents,? said the designer of one of the most-awaited collections at the fashion week.

 Monday ? the sixth day of the fashion week ? ended with a commendable show by Calcutta designer Anamika Khanna, who after the successful exhibition of her autumn winter 2005-2006 collection called Ana-Mika at London Fashion Week, unveiled it for the Indian audience.

 Khanna?s trademark textures were combined with rich embroidery, crochet, patchwork of prints and stripes and pinstripe appliqu?s. Bright hues were contrasted with tones of subdued blue, charcoal, greens, browns, pinks and liberal amounts of black and white.

 Roamy, voluminous skirts, jackets of varying lengths and churi pants were the high points of the silhouettes. Fabrics ranged from lush velvets, wool and tweeds to sensuous chiffons and matte linens.

 ?The collection was very successful at London Fashion Week and it will be on the racks at Harrods from August,? the designer said.

 Back to Day Seven, the other show that rocked was the only display of a totally men?s wear collection. Designer Arjun Khanna presented his energetic line, Rockstar goes to Morocco, at a fun-filled show in the afternoon.

 From pin-striped suits and fitted-at-the-waist jackets to sherwanis and kurtas ? the garments had the Moroccan feel. While linen was the main fabric focus, denim, too, played a major role in the line and that?s what added the rock star feel to the Moroccan influence.

 Patched and textured denim jackets, blazers and bandhgalas of the same fabric were combined with linen lowers.

 If India Fashion Week is a pointer towards the trends that will rule the country?s style scene for the next couple of seasons, designer duo Ashima and Leena Singh summarised the looks quite well in their women?s wear line.

 Free-flowing skirts of every shape and length, layers and layers of voluminous lowers, long jackets paired with almost every silhouette, classic styles with modern twists ? the collection highlighted all these trends thrown up by the previous six days of the fashion week.

 The Delhi-based designers presented five collections with influences spanning the globe.

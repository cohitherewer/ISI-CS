 Appeal for seer exile from south 

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Tamil Nadu government today moved the Supreme Court, seeking an order that Jayendra Saraswati ?shall not reside? in southern India till the trial in the Shankar Raman murder case is over.

 The state petition contended that the Kanchi acharya was the first accused in the case and would tamper with evidence and influence witnesses if he is allowed to stay in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Pondicherry.

 ?The investigation is still under progress. The majority of the witnesses belong to Kancheepuram. In fact, their livelihood is dependent on the mutt. The petitioner (acharya), as the peethapathi of the Kanchi Kamakothi Peetham, is in a position to wield enormous influence in Kancheepuram,? the petition said.

 ?The state apprehends that if the petitioner stays in any part of south India, he would be in a position to influence and threaten the witnesses,? the petition added. It thus sought to modify a bail condition that the seer shall not visit the mutt at Kancheepuram till investigations were over.

 The state petition further said the ?Kanchi mutt has got its centres all over India, including Delhi, and the petitioner may stay anywhere else in India till the trial is over?.

 Within hours of filing the petition, the state moved another seeking to remove certain remarks of the Supreme Court on the evidence in the case because these would have a ?bearing? on the trial.

 Both petitions are likely to be mentioned during the apex court?s mention hour for an urgent hearing and may be marked for the same bench that granted bail to the acharya.

 The first petition had initially said the seer ?shall not stay? in the four southern states. When someone said this would mean he could stay in Pondicherry, the petition was urgently amended to include the Union territory and to say that the acharya should not stay in southern India at all.

 It also sought a court directive that the seer and his followers shall not give any media statement and the mutt shall not give any advertisements in papers and the visual media so that the case is not influenced.

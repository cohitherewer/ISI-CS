 India renews ban on Iraq travel

 Dubai (PTI): With companies in Oman sending 

 Indians to work in Iraq, India has reminded its nationals 

 living there that the ban on travel to Iraq is still in 

 place. 

 The ban came into effect after three Indians were kidnapped in Iraq in July 2004.

 The embassy of India reiterates the Government of Indias decision regarding imposition of ban on travel of Indian nationals from Oman to Iraq, the Indian mission in Muscat said in a statement.

 The travel ban was imposed in view of the security situation in Iraq and is motivated by the Indian governments concern for the safety and security of its nationals. 

 The embassy has advised all Oman-based companies employing Indian nationals to co-operate in the implementation of the ban and refrain from sending Indians to Iraq in the interest of their standing with the Indian government, local daily Gulf News reported.

 Photo scare in Rishikesh

 Dehra dun (PTI): The holy city of Rishikesh 

 was on high alert for a brief while on Monday evening after 

 photographs taken by two foreign tourists seemed to show 

 some dreaded terrorists and their hideouts.

 A studio owner informed a police official that some foreigners had given him film rolls to develop that seemed to show militants in their hideouts.

 However, investigations revealed that the French tourists had taken the photographs innocently during their visit to Peshawar in Pakistan, the police said.

 crime bureau on the lines of the CBI is on the anvil, Union

 were found dumped on the Agra-Mumbai national highway on

 Poisoner held

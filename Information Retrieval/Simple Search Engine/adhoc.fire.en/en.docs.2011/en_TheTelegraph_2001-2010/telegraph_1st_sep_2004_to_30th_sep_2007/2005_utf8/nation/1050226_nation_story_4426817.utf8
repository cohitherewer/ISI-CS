 Laloo courts enemy to fix friend

 Laloo Prasad: Miffed

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: A beleaguered Laloo Prasad Yadav is covertly sending feelers to the enemy camp in a bid to teach the Congress a lesson for creating the ?Paswan factor? and thus triggering fears of a hung House in Bihar. 

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief is ready to back even Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal (United) as chief minister if the need arises.

 Sources said senior Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav is also working on a post-poll alliance of Dal factions ? the RJD and the Dal (U) ? without the BJP in a return to the formidable grouping of Mandalites and backward-caste leaders of the early 1990s. The undivided Janata Dal had won 27 of 54 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in 1996.

 Laloo Prasad would explore the possibility of propping up a Kumar-led government if the RJD loses the numbers game. The reason is that Laloo Prasad is fearful of the Congress backing Ram Vilas Paswan for the top post if its alliance with the Lok Janshakti Party does well in the recently concluded polls.

 He also fears the likelihood of President?s rule ? as demanded by Paswan if his alliance misses a majority ? which would amount to Congress rule in Bihar.

 Wary of that party?s revival plans in the state at the RJD?s cost, Laloo Prasad knows a Dal alliance would be formidable enough to check the Congress?s ambitions. 

 RJD strategists said it suits the party if the political space in Bihar is shared between it and the BJP, with a third party or combination such as the Congress-LJP disallowed to take root. They fear that the latter combine could forge an upper caste-Dalit-Muslim alliance in the long run and uproot the RJD.

 This strategy suits the BJP, too, not only in Bihar but also at the Centre.

 For now, Laloo Prasad will not take on Sonia Gandhi but only her lieutenants, RJD sources said. ?But he has got the message conveyed to the Congress president that he is far from happy,? they said.

 According to them, indications from the Congress camp are that Sonia will not do anything at the moment to accentuate the Congress-RJD rift. Senior Congress leaders such as Pranab Mukherjee, the sources said, want to mend fences with Laloo Prasad.

 The RJD chief is upset with his ally at the Centre, especially human resource development minister Arjun Singh and senior Congress leader M.L. Fotedar and, according to sources, also with Manmohan Singh.

 RJD leaders believe the Prime Minister is behind reports that Laloo Prasad should renounce the railway portfolio as he is said to be a liability at the Centre, and replace Rabri Devi as Bihar chief minister.

 Laloo Prasad?s annoyance was evident today when he reacted sharply to reports that the Prime Minister?s Office was preparing his ministry?s budget. ?It is not true. It is mischievous. A certain section of the media is spreading such things,? he said here.

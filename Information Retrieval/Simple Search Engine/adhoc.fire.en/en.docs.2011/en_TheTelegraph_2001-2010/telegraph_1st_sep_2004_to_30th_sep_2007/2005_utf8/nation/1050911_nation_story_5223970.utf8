 Army probes bridge fall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Sept. 10: A shocked Indian Army is probing one of its worst disasters: the collapse of a Bailey bridge on Sutlej during construction, killing 34 personnel.

 This is a very tragic incident for the army in many years. Similar tragedies occurred during the Burma campaign in 1942-43, in the Northeast and another in Kargil, Lt Gen. S. Pattabhiraman said here today after a visit to the site, Kharo in Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh.

 Thirty-four of our brave men have been lost. We are now searching for the bodies, said Pattabhiraman, who will be taking over as army vice-chief on October 1.

 The general said he was treating Thursdays tragedy not as an accident but on a par with battle casualties. My request to the media is not to trouble the families. It is as big a loss to them as it is to the army. My heart goes out to the families who have lost their loved ones.

 The wives of two of the victims have been admitted to hospital in a state of shock. Of the 34, ten were married.

 A team from the 18 Engineers Regiment was lending the final touches to the bridge that was to be opened to traffic in a couple of days. The original bridge had been washed away during the June floods.

 The general said its too early to fix blame ? either on the material being used or on those building the bridge. 

 The court of inquiry will look into the causes of the collapse ? whether it was human error or metallurgical failure, he said.

 The terrain, especially in Himachal Pradesh, is very difficult and officers leading bridge construction teams do improvise. I, too, would have done that. Anyone would have improvised.

 The material for construction came from the Garden Reach Workshop in Calcutta. We will have to see if there was any metallurgical failure as both new and old bridge-building material was being used, the general added.

 Just before the bridge caved in, Lt Col Amardeep Singh, who died in the accident, had ordered that all the nuts and bolts be rechecked.

 Rescue teams, scanning the river up to 40 km downstream, have so far traced only one body but havent been able to retrieve it. 

 Its in an isolated area and from the clothes, we have been able to figure out that it belongs to a havildar. We are trying our best to reach it, Pattabhiraman said.

 The delay is because of the current, which is hovering between 7 and 8 knots. Divers cannot get in if the current is over 4 knots, the general explained.

 Pattabhiraman said the collapsed bridge served no strategic interest; it was meant mainly for civilians.

 March wedding for Liz

 London, Nov. 27 (PTI): British model-actor Liz Hurley will marry her millionaire Indian boyfriend Arun Nayar in a 16th century fort converted into a five-star hotel at Devigarh in Rajasthan in March 2006.

 The pair is planning to tie the knot in a lavish three-day ceremony with Arun making an eye-popping entrance on an elephant, The News Of The World tabloid reported today, quoting a pal of the couple.

 The Devigarh fort is one of Indias most sought after venues. It has 23 exclusive suites, each with its own swimming pool and jacuzzi.

 Guests will include soccer star David Beckham and his wife Victoria, British actor Patsy Kensit and Pamela Anderson. Lizs close friends Elton John and David Furnish will also be there, with David taking the unusual role of maid of honour. 

 They are delighted with the venue. Theyve been looking for the perfect place for ages and now theyve found it, the pal of the couple was quoted as saying. 

 Arun celebrated his 40th birthday there (the Devigarh fort) and they both loved it so much they decided to get married there. It will be a three-day-long ceremony and there will be Indian and western celebrations. There is a huge guest list and its to be a no-expense-spared occasion. It will be the wedding of the year.

 They havent decided on the exact date yet, but it will be some time in March, the pal said.

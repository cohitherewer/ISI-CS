 Passport warrant on Monica

 Bhopal, Nov. 14: A local court today issued an arrest warrant against Monica Bedi, as cable channels beamed Tada, in which she had played the girlfriend of a man accused under the now-defunct anti-terror act. 

 Monicas role as Abu Salems moll may have been cut short, but her reel life might soon flicker back on the screen. Unconfirmed reports said Tadas director Shishir Mishra is planning to re-release the film to cash in on the publicity generated by Portugals handover of the don and Monica.

 The film, released in 2003, ends with the gangster giving up crime and taking revenge on those responsible for turning him into a don. According to screenplay writer Pyarelal Sharma, the film was inspired by Sanjay Dutt, also charged under Tada after the 1993 Bombay blasts, and not Abu Salem. 

 Monica is wanted here in connection with a fake passport case.

 She and Salem had allegedly obtained forged passports in the names of Faujia Usman and Danish Baig in June 2001. A case was registered here and the evidence had been conveyed to the Portuguese authorities as well.

 Police are awaiting their turn before seeking a production warrant against Monica and Salem. She is currently under CBIs custody and in remand at Hyderabad. We are in touch with all concerned and will act when our turn comes, superintendent of police Anant Kumar Singh said. 

 The Bhopal court is scheduled to hear the fake passport case on Saturday but, Singh said, Monica need not be present. A team will be sent to fetch Monica once the charges against her in Hyderabad are dealt with.

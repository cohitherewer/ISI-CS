 New Delhi, July 26: Questions are flying fast and furious whether the Gurgaon stand-off need have happened at all.

 Dozens of injured workers of Honda Scooter and Motorcycle India Pvt Ltd and Aituc office-bearers believe it could have been averted had the Centre and the Haryana government heeded their pleas. 

 Aituc general secretary and CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta had warned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about the state of affairs at the factory as early as June 4. 

 On June 27, he had written to Singh about the deteriorating situation and requested him to intervene.

 The letter said the management had attacked union office-bearers at their residence the night before with the help of police and musclemen. Two had been flung down from the second floor, causing them severe fractures.

 Reign of terror prevails in the establishment. The CM of Haryana has been kept fully informed of the situation but no effective intervention has taken place....

 I have mentioned the above instances to further apprise you that attacks on workers are on the increase in spite of the fact that your good self had assured that we will get the response in 10 days time, the letter said.

 The Aituc and Honda workers union met Haryana chief minister B.S. Hooda five times before deciding to go on protest. An injured worker said Hooda refused help in April and asked the workers to do whatever your company says.

 He also warned us against forming any sort of union, the worker alleged.

 Aituc wrote to Hooda on May 26. In a situation where the management continues to harass the workers, the industrial relations are likely to worsen further... We request you once again to intervene in the matter, it said.

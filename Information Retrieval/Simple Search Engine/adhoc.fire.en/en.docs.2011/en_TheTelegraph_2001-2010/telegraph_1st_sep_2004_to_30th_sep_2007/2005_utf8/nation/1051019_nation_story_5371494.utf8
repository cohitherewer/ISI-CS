 Tents add to quake woes

 Uri, Oct. 18: They drip and even get blown away in the wind.

 With the weather playing spoilsport, tents provided to quake victims in Uris ravaged villages are throwing another challenge to the already devastated population: how to keep their belongings dry.

 Those without polythene sheets have failed to keep out the rain, snow and strong winds that have been occasionally lashing the upper reaches of Kashmir. One tent also had several holes in it.

 We need to keep out the wind and the rain. None of us has slept properly as rainwater has been entering our tents. It has spoiled our quilts and blankets that we managed to salvage from the rubble that once was our home, said Fatima in Jhulla.

 Several women in Jhulla and Salamabad were busy drying quilts and mattresses in the sun soon after the weather cleared a bit after a spell of torrential rain.

 If this is our condition now, what will happen to us in the winter? asked 14-year-old Sahiba, also of Jhulla. Hukumat ko soochna chahiye. Fauj kitna kuch kar sakti hai, unhone to hame zindagi babshi hai (The government should understand our plight and do something. The army has done a lot. It has given us another life), she added.

 Heavy rain in Uri earlier this week hampered relief operations as fresh landslides blocked roads to the affected villages.

 For hundreds of residents in Uri shivering in the cold, the only warmth comes from the fire they light outside their tents. It becomes very cold inside at night. So we take turns to sit around the fire, said Mumtaz of Salamabad. 

 More people will die if shelters with tin roofs are not provided immediately. The army is already moving heavy equipment and engineers by the hundreds from the plains. 

 But it will take time as their movement is slow and it is not easy to ferry the machines on aircraft. We are trying to get the administration to understand the need for proper shelters, said Zahoor, a volunteer from Srinagar who is helping quake victims in Salamabad. 

 It has become difficult for us to work among the victims by just providing them food. If they get a roof, they will manage their own food, he added.

 So far, only 25 per cent of the affected population in Uri have been provided with tents. No estimate has yet been made on the number of victims in dire need of tents in the inhospitable regions of the district. 

 Most of the air-dropped tents have landed in the hands of politicians or government officials who, people allege, were either selling or distributing them to supporters.

 Border standoff after firing

 - ?Bangla Rifles refused to see reason?

 MEHEDI HEDAYTULLAH

 Moragati (North Dinajpur), Feb. 27: The fluttering red flag and deserted villages are a clear indication that all?s not well in this border area, whose peace was shredded by blazing guns on Friday and failed talks yesterday.

 The Border Security Force (BSF) is on alert and ready for ?any eventuality?, just like their counterparts on the other side of Nagar river.

 Bullet-ridden walls and roofs bear testimony to the exchange of fire between the border forces, allegedly started by the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) after the BSF objected to the construction of an embankment along the river. 

 The BSF?s contention was that the construction was being carried out despite an embargo on such work within 150 metres from the border.

 BSF sources said the BDR had resumed construction late on Friday evening. 

 ?When we objected to the violation of the international agreement between the two countries, the BDR opened fire. It was totally unprovoked. We had to return fire,? said Rakesh Chauhan, the commandant of the BSF?s 32 Battalion here, some 20 km from Islampur.

 Senior BSF sources said the BDR fired more than 100 rounds, while the BSF replied with over 50 shots. There were no casualties on both sides.

 Yesterday morning, talks between the commandants of both sides were held on the Indian side of the border.

 ?The talks fell through as the BDR refused to see reason. Their commandant, Mustafizur Rehman, returned unconvinced,? a senior BSF officer said. ?We are on alert as the BDR has taken up positions on their side. We are ready for any eventuality.?

 The men of two small settlements in the area on the Indian side, Pakhargaj and Singatgaj, have moved their women and children to safer places following the gun battle on Friday evening. They are upset over the development and blamed the BSF for not warning them that the situation was tense along the border here.

 ?We suddenly heard the sound of rifle fire and many bullets also struck the tin roofs and walls of our huts. It was all very scary. We moved out our women and children last morning,? said Hafizul of Pakhargaj village.

 The problem is not confined to just the tension between the border guards. With plenty of agricultural land located beyond the barbed-wire fence, many villagers are not being able to tend to their crops. Work has also stopped in tea garden areas that also fall on the other side of the fence.

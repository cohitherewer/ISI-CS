 Mallya mystery in Tipu sale

 AMIT ROY

 A sword at the auction

 London, May 27: A large collection of Tipu Sultan memorabilia, including a quiver, cannon, trophy sword and flintlock pistols, sold this week at Sothebys for over ?1.2 million but the London auction refused to confirm whether the Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya had bought any of the objects.

 All the items relating to Tipu Sultan were not bought by one person, was all a spokesman for Sothebys was prepared to say. 

 However, Mallya, who bought a majestic sword belonging to the Mysore two years ago ? he found it hard to cut through customs red tape in India, however ? has expressed his determination to add to his collection of Tipu Sultan memorabilia.

 So, it is safe to assume he has bought some of the items offered for auction this week.

 In all, the Tipu Sultan objects fetched a total of ?1,239,240, including a buyers premium of between 12 per cent and 20 per cent depending on whether an object costs more or less than ?100,000.

 Before the auction, Sothebys said that the Tipu Sultan Collection was originally formed by Robin Wigington ? author and leading authority on Tipu firearms ? over a period of 30 years and although it has since changed hands, it remains completely in tact.

 It added: It is the most important collection of its kind ever to come to the market and is estimated to fetch in excess of ?800,000 when it is offered for sale. The single owner sale will include an outstanding group of weaponry and other rarities captured after the British stormed Tipu Sultans palace at Seringapatam in May 1799.

 In describing the man, Sothebys said: Tipu Sultan, Tiger of Mysore (reigned 1782-99), is one of the great heroes of Indian history. Described by Mahatma Gandhi as an embodiment of Hindu-Muslim unity, Tipu led a heroic and ultimately doomed struggle against the occupying power. His honourable resistance and glorious death, standing sword in hand defending the gates of his palace, left a lasting impression on vanquishers and vanquished alike.

 And the auction house went on: After the siege, his palace was duly sacked by the British. Much of the booty captured by General Baird and Colonel Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington) was presented to Mad King George, George III (r.1760-1820), and ended up in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, but a considerable quantity was distributed among the British officers who led the successful campaign. Many of these treasures were passed down through generations and were subsequently acquired for the Tipu Sultan Collection.

 Tipu, Sothebys added, was obsessed with tigers and adopted the tiger motif as his emblem of state, which was stamped on every item in court, including guns and the hilts of swords. One of the most important highlights in the collection is an Exotic Gem-set Trophy Sword.

 The throne itself was described by European visitors to Tipus court and was clearly a thing of great wonder supported by a life-size tiger made of gold inset with rubies, emeralds and diamonds. After the siege the throne was broken into pieces by the British soldiers. The collection also includes a magnificent embroidered tent canopy stitched with tiger stripes in gold and silver thread from Tipus throne.

 The group of weaponry is highlighted by Tipu Sultans silver-mounted flintlock sporting gun with stock carved in the form of a leaping tiger, by Asad Khan Muhammed, Mysore, 1793-4. 

 The tiger detailing even extends along the barrel of the gun which flashes with tiger stripes. It is a sensational weapon. Other highlights include two field cannons from Tipus palace with barrels in the form of roaring tigers.

 In the event, the prices fetched were as follows:

 * ?120,000 for a silver mounted flintlock sporting gun from the personal armoury 

 * ?78,000 for an exceptional embroidered quiver and matching arm defences, late 18th century

 * ?72,000 a rare 3-pounder bronze cannon, on its presentation field carriage, from Tipus palace

 * ?66,000 a 3-pounder bronze cannon, from Tipus palace

 * ?60,000 for an exotic gem-set trophy sword, Seringapatam, circa 1782-93

 * ?60,000 for a pair of silver-mounted flintlock pistols by Muhammad-e Almas, dated Mawludi year 1220

 * ?50,400 for a 14-bore silver-mounted flintlock fowling-piece from the armoury of Tipu Sultan

 * ?50,400 a very rare sword with bubri-patterned watered blade, from the palace armoury of Tipu Sultan

 * ?43,200 for an extremely rare quilted helmet, Mysore, late 18th-century

 * ?42,000 a silver-mounted flintlock blunderbuss, dated Mawludi Year 1223.

 No doubt, Mallya will something to say soon. 

 But commenting on the sale, Edward Gibbs, head of Sothebys Islamic department, said: We are delighted with the results of todays sale. There was competitive bidding from the sale room and on the telephones, and an exceptional result was achieved for this unique collection.

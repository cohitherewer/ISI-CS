 Military wakes up to suicide syndrome 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The armed forces are circulating reports of psychologists and defence analysts among commanders from the headquarters to the unit levels on tackling mental disorders among troops after recent statistics revealed that a soldier suicide was reported almost every fifth day for the last three years.

 Studies on tension levels and psychological profiles of soldiers have been discussed in the commanders conferences and a periodical review of measures that have been advised is being made mandatory.

 The measures include the revival of old mechanisms of interaction between the officers and troops, especially just before and after a soldier goes on leave.

 Statistics that have recently been made public have noted that between 2002 and 2005, a suicide by a soldier was being reported nearly every five days. 

 The armed forces are also taking up detailed studies of violence within the services that reflects intense frustration among troops, especially those who have served in counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and in the Northeast for a long time. 

 Such incidents of violence include assault and affray.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a written reply to Parliament last week: Identification, analysis and prevention of cases of serious offences by troops is an ongoing process. In this regard, measures suggested in the report of the study by the College of Defence Management have been widely disseminated to all concerned. 

 Instructions have been issued whereby timely and positive response regarding requirement of the troops and unit sentiments are encouraged.

 According to statistics placed by the minister in Parliament, there were 66 suicides by soldiers in 2002, 96 in 2003, 100 in 2004 and 71 till November, 2005. This means there were 262 suicides in three years from 2002 to 2004. The figure for 2005 so far is nine less than the average number of suicides by soldiers every year for the last three years.

 The statistics also show that the number of assault and affray cases that include battering of officers by soldiers or violence among troops totalled 95 incidents between 2002 and 2004. 

 In 2005, the statistics counted 18 incidents.

 These incidents also include fragging, a dreaded term that describes the killing or an attempt at killing of an officer by a soldier. Violence within troops, on an average, was reported every thirteenth day for the last three years.

 A separate table on murders shows that six killings were reported in 2002, 16 in 2003, 18 in 2004 and 16 reported so far in 2005. The Indian Army has a strength of 11,54,108 troops.

 Statistics of the National Crime Records Bureau report that in 1999, India reported about 1 lakh suicides a year.

 The statistics show that every 15 minutes there were three suicides reported in the country.

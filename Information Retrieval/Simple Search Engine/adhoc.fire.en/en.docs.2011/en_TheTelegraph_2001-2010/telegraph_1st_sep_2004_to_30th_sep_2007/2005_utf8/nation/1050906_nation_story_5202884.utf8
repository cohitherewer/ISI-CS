 Bangalore, Sept. 5: Greenpeace activists today launched a campaign against the stockpile of e-waste, dumping about half a tonne of electronic gadgets at the corporate headquarters of Wipro here.

 A dozen activists of the Indian unit of Greenpeace said they acquired Wipro-branded e-waste from illegal recycling yards in New Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore.

 They alleged that several companies were selling old computers, telecom equipment, television sets and refrigerators ? all sources of hazardous chemicals ? to junk dealers who burn them in illegal yards for extraction of metals, including gold and cadmium.

 The toxic gases released during unscientific recycling processes can cause several diseases, including cancer. We consider the only way to deal with the growing problem of e-wastes is for the corporates to design clean electronics with longer lifespan that are safe and easy to recycle without exposing workers and the environment to hazardous chemicals, Greenpeace Indias Ramapati Kumar said.

 Kumar said Wipro Infotech officials, lead by chief administrative officer Balagiridhar, agreed to discuss the issue of e-waste management with Greenpeace members early next month. Wipro, an iconic Indian brand, prides itself on its strength in the technology and enterprise domains. Its high time it used these strengths to make the much-needed shift to clean production and build a competitive edge by introducing products that do not cause harm to the environment or to people, Kumar said.

 Greenpeace has appealed to firms that roll out electronic goods to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their products and substitute them with safe alternatives. Companies should take extended producer responsibility for all their products, from the production cycle to the end of the products life cycle, Kumar said.

 A spokesman for Wipro, however, denied that the companys products, including personal computers and peripherals, were sent to recycling yards for disposal. We sell our electronic products to institutional and retail buyers through our distribution network. Once they buy, we have no control over what they do with the end-products, the spokesman said.

 The disposal of old or outdated products is a larger issue. Unless the whole ecosystem is changed, the problem of e-waste remains. The whole industry has to address the issue. There is a need for research and manufacture of electronic products with plastic materials that are bio-degradable and avoid using toxic materials, he added.

 Sources in the Manufacturers Association for Information Technology said this tech hub could, by the end of the year, choke under a heap of e-waste generated by the IT industry.

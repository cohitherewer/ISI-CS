 Raid on sultan throws up arms amp; deer

 ASHISH SINHA

 Shahabuddin: Trouble ahead?

 Patna, April 24: Mohammad Shahabuddin, the controversial Rashtriya Janata Dal MP from Siwan, suffered a jolt once again with the district administration, assisted by the special task force, raiding Pratappur, his village, today and recovering a large quantity of arms and ammunition, besides a deer kept captive.

 District magistrate C.K. Anil, who has declared Siwan out of bounds for Shahabuddin for six months, accompanied the raiding team that continued its swoop for 12 hours. Anil, in his reply to a notice on the MP?s externment, has highlighted his criminal track record, stressing why such an action was necessary for maintaining peace in the district.

 Around eight houses in Pratappur, including two of Shahabuddin, were raided, an STF official said, adding that four persons were arrested during the operation. ?One of them is Jamaluddin and the other is Maqsood. The identity of the other two is being ascertained. We are surprised at the nature of recoveries, which include a night vision device and a Bragon light used in anti-insurgency operations,? the officer said.

 STF sources said two semi-automatic rifles, one American pistol, one revolver, 400 live cartridges and Rs 40,000 in cash was recovered from Jamaluddin?s house. ?A stolen Tata Sumo, belonging to a doctor, Saroj Singh, and a revolver licensed to someone else were recovered from the house of Maqsood,? the sources added.

 ?The recovery from Shahabuddin?s houses includes three motorcycles, one Maruti van, one night vision device, a Bragon light, two wireless handsets, two bullet-proof jackets and 80 rounds of ammunition. We also laid hands on a large sum of Arab currency, two deerskin and an alive deer at the place,? the STF official said.

 The district magistrate, who has won all round appreciation for his efforts to restore rule of law in Siwan during the past few months, had held a janata durbar at Pratappur yesterday, which was attended by a large number of villagers.

 Anil has attracted criticism not only from Shahabuddin, known as the sultan of Siwan, but RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav and senior leader Shivanand Tiwary for his action, which these politicians have described as ?arbitrary?. The IAS officer had debarred Tiwary from entering the district and his attempt to violate the order led to his arrest and subsequent release recently.

 Shahabuddin, whose writ used to run in Siwan, did not dare to enter the district to attend a railway function presided over by Laloo Prasad recently, despite his name being announced as the guest of honour. At this meeting, Tiwary had attacked Anil in his speech.

 As part of his ?confidence building measures?, the district magistrate recently bicycled in the villages as part of a literacy campaign.

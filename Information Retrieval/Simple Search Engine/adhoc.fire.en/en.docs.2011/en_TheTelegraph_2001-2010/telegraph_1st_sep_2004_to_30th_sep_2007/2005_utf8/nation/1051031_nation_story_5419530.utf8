 Calcutta, Oct. 30: Satyabrata and Supriya Mukherjee were to return home on Monday with 13-year-old son Sayan, loaded with Diwali gifts from Delhi for the entire family.

 They will indeed be back at their Kalighat home tomorrow ? in coffins hiding the couples charred, mutilated bodies. Sayan is still untraced.

 The family had chosen Sarojini Nagars Babu Market to shop last evening. That one blast has darkened the Mukherjees Diwali this year.

 I received a phone call around midnight from Delhi and came to know that my brother, his wife and Sayan are no more, elder brother Debabrata Mukherjee said. I could not believe my ears. I didnt know what to tell my parents, who are above 80. I called back Satyabratas brother-in-law (N.K. Bhattacharjee, at whose home the Mukherjees were staying in Delhi) and he confirmed the news.

 Satyabrata is completely charred; Supriya has had the lower portion of her body blown off.

 This morning, Satyabratas mother Kalyani and younger brother Nababrata flew to Delhi to claim the bodies. His ailing father has been fainting repeatedly.

 Please leave us alone. Dont keep asking questions. A family is ruined, thats all I have to say, Debabrata shouted from the first-floor balcony.

 Satyabrata, 45, was the second of Sukumar Mukherjees five sons. His and Debabratas families lived at 18/C Kali Lane, near the Kalighat temple, with their parents.

 The Allahabad bank employee was popular in the neighbourhood and was involved in various social activities. Today, scores of neighbours gathered at the house to console the family.

 Sayan studied in class VII at South Point School. Everybody liked him ? he used to play the violin, said Sheli Mukherjee.

 They used to visit Delhi almost every year after the Puja. They would bring varieties of rangmashal from Delhi almost every year and we all used to enjoy the spectacle on Diwali night. It will be a dark Diwali this time, said Asit Chowdhury.

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Anuj Sharma said the administration was ready to provide the Mukherjees any help they needed to bring the bodies back. We are in touch with the family and have asked the local police to provide support, Sharma said.

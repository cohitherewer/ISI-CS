 BJP slams govt 

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: The BJP today criticised the Centre for its ?tardy? handling of relief work in the tsunami-ravaged areas but praised its former ally, Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa, for the ?initiatives? she took on relief, reports our special correspondent.

 Setting the tone for an all-party meeting convened by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow to discuss the tsunami and its aftermath, the BJP also raised questions on whether a warning could have been issued after an earthquake struck Sumatra around 5.50 in the morning on December 26 and on the official death toll. 

 A BJP relief committee, constituted under the chairmanship of Jaswant Singh, met this morning to take stock of the situation and decide what ?line? the party should adopt in tomorrow?s meeting.

 Jaswant Singh later stressed the need to move away from ?empty and shallow exercises to the reality of the crisis?. He termed the approach of officialdom as ?unfortunate? and alleged that a number of ?incorrect statements? like water supply being restored were being put out. 

 The BJP leader, who had toured the affected areas, said the civil administration in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was yet to get its act together and blamed the Centre for the ?slackness? because the islands were directly under its control. 

 On the ?failure? of a warning system, the former Union minister said: ?The defence ministry had the information (about tsunami) when the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were hit and a warning could have been issued in the coastal areas of the mainland (of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, etc).? He said: ?It is important that the government explain where the failure of early warning lay.?

 The BJP leader was harsh on the Centre for its ?casual? attitude while putting out the figures of the dead. ?Even now, we do not have the confirmed number of citizens who have died.?

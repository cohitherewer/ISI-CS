 Kidnap boss evades police 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Kislay: Back home

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: Vicky Thakur, the main accused in the abduction of Patna student Kislay Kaushal, evaded Delhi police last evening near a multiplex at Saket but three of his associates were arrested. 

 Vicky, a trusted aide of jailed north Bihar gangster Chunnu Thakur, is suspected to have masterminded the kidnapping of the Delhi Public School, Patna, student on January 19 when he was on his way to school. 

 A special Delhi police team had been coordinating with the Bihar force for the past 10 days following information that Vicky was in Delhi. 

 Around 8.30 last evening, police teams lay in wait near the PVR movie multiplex at Saket on a tip-off that Vicky would be coming in a Safari. They rounded up Brajesh Mishra, 25, Rajesh Singh alias Chintu, 23, and Rajiv Chaudhary alias Master, 24, on the charge of assisting Vicky in the snatch operation and harbouring him, but did not get the kingpin. He had already boarded the Northeast Express. 

 The police are trying to ascertain if Kislay was brought to Delhi and hidden here or the three had found a hideout to be used as a safe house by Vicky. 

 Praveer Ranjan, deputy commissioner, south district, said the three had been told to hunt for a hideout. The Safari with Uttar Pradesh registration plates belonged to Mintu Singh, an old classmate of Vicky from Delhi University. 

 The arrested Rajiv Chaudhary and Rajesh Singh are Vicky?s schoolmates based in Delhi, where they operated for Chunnu Thakur, now lodged in Hajipur jail, arranging hideouts and other logistics. 

 Bihar police have been informed and a team is on its way to take custody of the trio.

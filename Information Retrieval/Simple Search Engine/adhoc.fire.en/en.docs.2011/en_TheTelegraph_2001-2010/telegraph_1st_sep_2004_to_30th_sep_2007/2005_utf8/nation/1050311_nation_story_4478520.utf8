 Dalai balm on Beijing fears

 ALOKE TIKKU

 The Dalai Lama

 McLeodganj (Dharamsala), March 10: The Dalai Lama today renewed the commitment of Tibetans not to seek independence from China as long as he is ?responsible for the affairs of Tibet?.

 The spiritual leader has also sought to assure China that his involvement in non-religious matters was not to claim certain personal rights or political position for himself or stake claim for the Tibetan administration-in-exile.

 ?I will not hold any office in the Tibetan government or any other political position and the present Tibetan administration-in-exile will be dissolved,? he said at a ceremony at the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile to mark the anniversary of the National Tibetan Uprising Day of 1959.

 The Dalai Lama, by declaring his intention to stay away from politics once the situation is conducive for the return of exiled Tibetans, was trying to allay Beijing?s misgivings about his role once back in Tibet. 

 Beijing is not entirely convinced by his commitment on Tibetans not seeking independence and views him as a symbol of separatism. The communist party?s official newspaper calls him ?a political plotter scheming to separate the Tibet Autonomous Region from China?. This fear had led to China turning down his request to visit Tibet.

 The Nobel laureate, as a confidence-building measure, addressed Chinese concerns to ?reassure the Chinese authorities that as long as I am responsible for the affairs of Tibet we remain fully committed to?not seeking independence for Tibet?.

 ?China?s image is tarnished by her human rights records, undemocratic actions, the lack of the rule of law and unequal implementation of autonomy rights regarding minorities, including the Tibetans,? he said, asking Beijing to adopt a ?reasonable policy?.

 The Dalai Lama?s envoys intend to return to Beijing this year to continue the dialogue that resumed in 2001. Samdhong Rinpoche, Prime Minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, had yesterday been optimistic that the fourth round of talks would be ?decisive?.

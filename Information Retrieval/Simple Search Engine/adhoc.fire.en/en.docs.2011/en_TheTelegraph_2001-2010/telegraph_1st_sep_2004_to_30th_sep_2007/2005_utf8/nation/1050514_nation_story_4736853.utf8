 Modi wins in shuffle

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Ahmedabad, May 13: Uma Bharti has been put in place, but Narendra Modi has had his way.

 The Gujarat chief minister managed to push through the appointment of loyalist Vajubhai Wala as state BJP president. Rajkot MP Vallabhbhai Katheria, backed by Modis arch rival and former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, lost out.

 Wala had stood by Modi through the recent spurts of dissent. The state finance minister, despite being a Patel, refused to bite the caste bait and become a part of the Keshubhai group that spearheaded the aborted revolt against Modi.

 His appointment ? a part of the organisational changes announced by BJP chief L.K. Advani today ? is a signal to the anti-Modi group that they should end their protests. 

 In Madhya Pradesh, party general secretary Shivraj Singh Chauhan was made the state chief. Chauhan was unwilling to move back to the state but changed his mind on the assurance that he would replace Babulal Gaur as chief minister in six months, according to sources.

 This has put paid to Umas plans of coming back to the centrestage of state politics soon. Like Uma, Chauhan is also from the other backward classes and is younger. He is not mercurial, is rated a strong organisational hand and is said to have a good equation with his senior and peers in the party and in the RSS. 

 Gaur, who was a trade unionist before joining the BJP, may return to the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh ? the RSS trade union front ? as an ideological guide-cum-adviser to fill the void created by the death of Dattopant Thengadi, said sources.

 In the shuffle, Om Prakash Mathur, a former RSS pracharak (whole-timer) was promoted from national secretary to general secretary. Mathurs upgradation was seen as a reward for the behind-the-scenes efforts he made in containing dissent in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.

 Kailash Joshi, who will hand over charge to Chauhan, has been made the prabhari (in-charge) of the state. Arun Jaitley, the current prabhari, will continue as the general secretary in charge of the state as a kind of super prabhari, said a source.

 Both factions in the Gujarat BJP welcomed Walas appointment, which took even him by surprise. Wala had no inkling about his new assignment until Mathur called him up around 2.30 pm.

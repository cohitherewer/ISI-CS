 Arjun enjoys funny drama

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, June 9: L.K. Advani made no reference to Jawaharlal Nehru when he called for a debate on his comments on Mohammed Ali Jinnah. George Fernandes, his colleague in the National Democratic Alliance, however, took the cue to bring Nehru into a debate he sought to initiate on Partition.

 If Advani and Fernandes are seeking to revisit Partition history and take another look at the role of Jinnah and Nehru in the event, veteran Congress leader Arjun Singh has not missed their script.

 A person like L.K. Advani does not measure up to Panditji, not even up to his knees, said the human resource development minister today. The architect of the United Progressive Alliances de-saffronisation drive was responding to suggestions by reporters that the BJP leader, through his statements praising Jinnah, might be trying to put Nehrus role in Partition under the scanner.

 Emerging out of a book release programme here, Singh made it clear he was enjoying the drama unfolding within the BJP and the Sangh parivar over Advanis secular certificate to Jinnah.

 Its good sometimes to see a funny drama, Singh said, referring to Advanis resignation as BJP president and then trying hard to retain the top post.

 After Advanis remarks set off ideological and leadership crises in the BJP, Singh and his ministry have eagerly begun to collect books, biographies and letters concerning Jinnah as well as the Complete Works of Jinnah.

 Asked about the possible reasons behind Advanis comments on Jinnah, Singh said: See, Mr Advani is a very clever man. Whether his cleverness pays off or not, is another matter.

 It is an attempt to confuse the nation. However, he has not succeeded, he added.

 Singh continued in a lighter vein: I have never met Jinnah. Advani might have met him though. As far as I am concerned, based on what I know, Jinnah cannot be called secular, definitely not.

 Singh, however, said that his assessment of Jinnah was based on his overall picture of the Quaid-e-Azam. 

 Obviously, the minister was aware that Jinnahs political career had two rather distinct phases ? the first half of his political career when he was with the Indian National Congress and the second when he championed the creation of Pakistan.

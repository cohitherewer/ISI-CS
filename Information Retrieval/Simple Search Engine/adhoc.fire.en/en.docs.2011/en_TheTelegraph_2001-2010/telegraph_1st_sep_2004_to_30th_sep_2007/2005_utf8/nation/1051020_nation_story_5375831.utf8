 Promise of close combat in waveless election

 TILAK D. GUPTA

 Deciphering the signals emanating from the first phase of the Bihar polls can be a tricky business, given the paucity of information and contradictory views expressed by various exit polls. 

 Nevertheless, three features instantly strike the mind. For one, there is no popular wave in favour of any single party or combination and it promises to be a close fight to the end of an agonisingly prolonged election due to finish on November 19. 

 Second, there are now enough indications to suggest that polling will continue to be low throughout Bihar, but it is not certain who gained the most from the poor turnout.

 And last, there are initial signs the Bihar Maoists like their counterparts in Andhra Pradesh are rethinking the tactics to be adopted towards the ongoing elections.

 Although the three different exit polls predict slightly different outcomes, it would manifestly be a tight race to the crown between the Laloo Prasad Yadav-led UPA and the NDA headed by Nitish Kumar.

 The only qualification that needs to be made here is that experience shows exit polls being less favourable to parties like the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar or the Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh. Nevertheless, whichever combination eventually triumphs will possibly be able only to cobble up a slim majority in the new House.

 Discerning observers of the states election scenario in Patna also confirm that no focal issue has emerged so far to catch the public imagination decisively one way or the other. That apart, the entrenched caste polarisation along political lines demands genuinely innovative electioneering to bring burning issues of the people to the fore. 

 None of the contenders appears to fit the bill, opines Ramchandra Lal Das, a senior advocate of Patna High Court and an eminent Patna intellectual. What, however, worries many well-meaning persons is that if a weak government dependent upon habitual turncoats and crime lords comes to power, the future will continue to remain bleak for Bihar.

 It may now be assumed that low polling will continue during all the five phases. The south Bihar plains where elections were held in the first phase has always been known as a developed agricultural region with a high level of political consciousness. If polling was poor here, it would be difficult to imagine higher voting in relatively less developed regions going to the hustings in the next phases. 

 Opinions, however, remain divided on the reasons behind the poor voter turnout. The official view put forward by the Election Commission and the state administration insist that low polling was principally due to an effective curb on bogus voting and booth capturing.

 While the BJP-Janata Dal (United) combine expressed satisfaction regarding the poll panels role, the LJP, RJD and the Left parties were not too happy about it. 

 State BJP chief Sushil Kumar Modi said only genuine voters have exercised their franchise. LJP national vice-president Ranjan Prasad Yadav, on the other hand, felt that poor voter attendance does not bode well for our democracy.

 Excessive and unnecessary restrictions on voters and blatant display of the states armed power have scared away many genuine persons, affirmed Satyanarayan Madan, the chairperson of the state child labour commission and a critical supporter of the RJD. 

 There is no denying that massive security arrangements made by the poll panel have deterred anti-socials in many places from capturing booths and indulging in false voting. 

 In the Paliganj constituency, for instance, Sailendra Mochi of Lala-Bhadsara village declined to risk his life to cast his ballot. Sipahi log bahut peet rahein hai (Police are beating up people), he said.

 If the commission has the dual task of conducting fair polls as well as facilitating maximum peoples participation in the democratic process, it has been eminently successful on the first count but needs to improve on the other by avoiding security overkill.

 In general, low polling goes in favour of the incumbent political parties and the anti-incumbency forces tend to lose on this score. But if the more assertive sections of Bihars caste-ridden society have managed to cast their ballots and the downtrodden masses have suffered more, it may be of some advantage to Nitish Kumar in round one. 

 An apologetic Laloo Prasad, of course, tackled the dissenters better this time and less Yadav rebel candidates in the fray would surely benefit him in the absence of a strong anti-incumbency wave.

 And last, one is tempted to believe that the Maoists are struggling to evolve a fresh tactic to deal with the poll. There were no sustained boycott campaigns by them unlike in the previous election and not a single incident of ambushing poll vehicles has occurred so far. 

 It might be premature to say the final word on the subject, as the poll personnel are still to return to the district headquarters safely with the EVMs. 

 Moreover, there are at least eight Maoist-affected districts in north-Bihar bordering Nepal that will go to polls in the later phases. 

 What can be said most at this point of time is that the Maoists while being critical of the parliamentary form of democracy may be looking for options other than sheer terror to battle what they term reactionary and revisionist political forces.

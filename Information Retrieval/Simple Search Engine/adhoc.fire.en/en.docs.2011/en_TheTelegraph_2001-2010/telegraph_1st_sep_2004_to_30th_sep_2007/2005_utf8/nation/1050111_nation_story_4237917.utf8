 Green trouble for Vedanta 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 10: The two-member central team, which visited the proposed alumina project site at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi district last month, is understood to have recommended suitable action against Vedanta Alumina for cutting trees without proper permission. 

 The team, comprising additional director-general (forests and wildlife) S.C. Sharma and assistant inspector-general (wildlife) in the ministry of environment and forests, Sanjiv Chaddha, submitted its report to the Supreme Court today. 

 Vedanta had signed a memorandum of understanding with the state-run Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC) to set up an alumina plant at Lanjigarh.

 The committee also said the company should have looked for sites other than Niyamgarh, where it has proposed to mine bauxite. ?Any mining activity in Niyamgiri will adversely affect the environment,? the report said. 

 The report said Vedanta has started its work without waiting for the government?s permission. The committee also slammed the company for starting work in Karlapat without having a proper action plan for the maintenance of environmental balance in the area.

 Hailing the report, the state Congress said it was a moral victory for the Opposition. ?The report should be honoured,? said Lalatendu Mohapatra, Congress MLA. 

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said he will react only after going through the report. ?Let me have a look at the report first,? he said.

 Opposition leaders have maintained that the proposed alumina plant will encroach upon 580.8 hectares of forestland in Kalahandi and the agreement between the government and Vedanta has reversed the state policy of not handing over bauxite deposits in Karlapat reserves since it is a notified wildlife sanctuary.

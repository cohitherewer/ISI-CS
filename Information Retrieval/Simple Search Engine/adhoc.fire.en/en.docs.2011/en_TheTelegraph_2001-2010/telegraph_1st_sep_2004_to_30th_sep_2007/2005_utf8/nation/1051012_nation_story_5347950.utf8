 Gaur funds home village in UP

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Oct. 11: After annoying his party leadership by providing a state aircraft for a Congress leaders foreign trip, Madhya Pradeshs BJP chief minister, Babulal Gaur, has finally decided to do something for his own people. He has sanctioned Rs 50 lakh for his ancestral village of Orripur Naugir.

 His own people? Not quite. Orripur Naugir is in Uttar Pradesh. And the Opposition in Madhya Pradesh is livid.

 Gaur recently visited his home village, in Pratapgarh district, after 14 years. The Uttar Pradesh units of the ruling Samajwadi Party, BJP and Congress got together to give him a warm welcome. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav announced a Rs 1-crore package for Gaurs village in a gesture of goodwill. Overwhelmed, Gaur added Rs 50 lakh to it from his governments pockets.

 Many in Madhya Pradesh believe that Gaur, with predecessor Uma Bharti gunning for him, has realised that his days as chief minister are numbered anyway. So he has abandoned all caution and is indulging his whims.

 The Madhya Pradesh BJP is trying to play down the chief ministers latest indiscretion, arguing weakly that Uttar Pradesh, after all, is a part of India. But the Opposition is baying for his blood.

 State Samajwadi Party chief Gauri Singh said: Madhya Pradesh is a picture of neglect while the chief minister is busy rewarding his kith and kin in Uttar Pradesh.

 Rahul Singh, state Congress vice-president and son of Union minister Arjun Singh, said: Gaur has played a cruel joke. He has shown his indifference for the people of Madhya Pradesh. He will be better off settling down in Uttar Pradesh.

 State Bahujan Samaj Party chief Bhujbal Singh Ahirwal has advised Gaur to be more judicious with taxpayers money. I wish he had the same affection for his Assembly constituency Govindpura, which has elected him for seven consecutive terms.

 Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh said Gaurs gesture was unprecedented. The chief minister is empowered to use his discretionary funds, but he needs to get it approved by the Assembly and justify spending, he said.

 In Pratapgarh, Gaur was received by Uttar Pradesh food and civil supplies minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh. The felicitation was attended by Uttar Pradesh Congress legislature party leader Pramod Tiwari, local MP Akshay Pratap Singh and BJP leader Shivkant Ojha.

 Gaur told the function he owed a lot to Pratapgarh, including his name. Originally Babulal Yadav, he became Babulal Gaur after his class IV teacher praised his power of concentration, saying: You read everything with gaur (concentration), so you should be called Gaur.

 At 76, Gaur, to many people, seems to have lost it. The BJP high command is reportedly unhappy with the chief ministers penchant for shooting his mouth off. After returning from the US, where he was strip-searched, Gaur described Americans as cowardly.

 He has made similar goofy remarks each time he travelled abroad. After returning from Kuala Lumpur, he told a news conference that while glancing at the highrises, he had almost fallen down.

 In Sharjah, Gaur said, he had managed to spot eight people from Bairagarh, a Sindhi suburb of Bhopal falling under his Assembly segment.

 Israeli molested on Manali trek

 Shimla: An Israeli tourist was allegedly 

 molested by her guide while trekking in a remote area of 

 Manali town, reports our correspondent. 

 Orit had hired a tourist guide, Balram, for trekking to the Kheerganga peak in Parvati valley on Sunday. Balram belongs to the base camp village Barshaini. 

 She was trekking alone and no other tourist was accompanying her. At a secluded spot along the route, the accused molested her, Prem Chand, the Kullu deputy superintendent of police, said.

 The victim lodged a molestation complaint with Manikarn police station on Tuesday, he said.

 This is the second time foreign tourists have been targeted by locals in the last 10 days in the state. 

 On August 26, an 18-year-old Belgian tourist who returned to a Dharamsala guesthouse midway through a trek was allegedly raped by a Tibetan youth at knifepoint.

 Salman gets back passport

 Mumbai (PTI): A day before trial begins 

 in the hit-and-run case, police have returned actor Salman 

 Khans passport and allowed him to go abroad for shoots.

 Khan, who is facing the charge of running over a person after ramming into a shop in 2002, had deposited his passport with Bandra police on a trial courts order.

 In August, when he appealed to the court for retrieving his passport, he was asked to approach the police.

 The police had initially refused to return it, forcing Salmans lawyer Deepesh Mehta to consider moving Bombay High Court.

 The high court had earlier granted Salman exemption from appearing regularly in court for the trial.

 Bar girl suicide

 Mumbai (PTI): A former bar girl allegedly 

 committed suicide on Tuesday, police said. 

 The body of Meena Ramu was found at her residence in suburban Goregaon. No suicide note, however, was found. No one has turned up to claim the body of Meena, who was known to be an alcoholic. 

 Fake Nasa topper

 Ballia (PTI): Saurabh Singh, who claimed 

 to have topped a Nasa examination, which had earlier been 

 cleared by only two Indians ? A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Kalpana 

 Chawla, has surrendered before a Uttar Pradesh court. Being 

 a minor, he has been relieved from judicial custody. Sourabhs 

 claim made headlines in January, but when Nasa denied it, 

 an inquiry was ordered. An FIR was lodged on September 2 

 to nab him.

 Pak gesture

 Karachi (AFP): Pakistan will release 

 371 Indian fishermen, held since last year for fishing in 

 its territorial waters, as a goodwill gesture. The fishermen 

 will travel from Karachi to Lahore on Saturday and be handed 

 over to India at the Wagah border on Sunday. 

 A weeklong festival of latest Bollywood films has begun in Moscow with the screening of Chokher Bali. There has been a growing interest about Indian films among young Russians.

 PM to clear air on pacts

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, July 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to make a suo motu statement on his US visit in Parliament on Friday.

 Official sources said the statement would cover the nuclear and the defence pacts (the latter was signed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee before Singhs visit). 

 Before that, the Prime Minister will meet leaders of the BJP and the Left parties, ostensibly to allay their misgivings on the two treaties, the sources added. 

 Singh was slated to hold a meeting with Left representatives this evening but it was put off as a DMK delegation called on him to discuss the Cauvery conflict.

 The BJP, which went ballistic over the nuclear deal a day after it was clinched suggesting it had compromised on national sovereignty, revised its stand after being confronted with evidence that the NDA government had proposed a similar pact with the US. 

 Brajesh Mishra, the national security adviser in the NDA regime, questioned Singhs assurance to US President George W. Bush on the segregation of civilian and military nuclear facilities and said it amounted to a cap on the size of Delhis minimum credible nuclear deterrent.

 The UPA establishments view was that the hard-nosed negotiations were built on the basic premise that a cap on the size of Indias arsenal will be totally unacceptable to the government. Under the pact, it added, India had the sovereign right to decide which of its facilities were civilian and which were military.

 The official standpoint was that the Indo-US joint statement plainly suggested that it was up to India to choose which of its facilities it would put under voluntary international safeguards. 

 It was said that the NDA government, in its earlier negotiations with the US, had agreed to put two nuclear facilities under safeguards in return for fuel for the Tarapur plant. The deal under consideration was deemed to bring in far fewer gains from the US. It is believed that as national security adviser, Mishra was the only other person, apart from then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, privy to the dealings and discussions.

 A statement from Vajpayee reiterating Mishras criticisms, reported earlier in a section of the press, had created rumblings within his party. Sources said Jaswant Singh was in favour of a more nuanced response to both the nuclear and defence pacts. 

 BJP sources said following the Prime Ministers statement, the NDA would demand a discussion on his US visit in which questions on the pacts may be raised. Vajpayee is being persuaded to speak during the discussion but sources said he was reluctant to do so because of the problems involved in diluting his earlier hard position.

 The BJP, therefore, has decided to fire its arsenal on the Supreme Courts directive to strike down the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act. Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha L.K. Advani tabled an adjournment motion against the abysmal failure of the government to protect the countrys eastern borders against the massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh.

 The motion referred to the apex courts order and mentioned it had described the illegal immigration as nothing short of an external aggression.

 BJP sources said Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee might allow a discussion on the motion, which entails voting, tomorrow. 

 The party has also tabled motions in the Upper House for a discussion on the terrorist attack in Ayodhya and the Prime Ministers address in Oxford University. The BJP raised objections to certain flattering references to colonial rule that his speech contained.

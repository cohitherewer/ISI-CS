 Ghouls amp; ghosts in cyber city

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, March 27: Black-magic killers struck last week in a town 280 km from the cyber city, which is shivering for fear of ghostly prowlers.

 Three-year-old Bande Nawaj was found dead, with torture marks on his body, at his parents? doorstep yesterday in Kurnool district?s Adoni town, known as the grain market of the south.

 Saudagar Mahboob Pasha, a private-bus driver, said his son went out to play on Friday evening, a full-moon day, and did not return home. 

 He complained to police after a futile search of the minority-dominated neighbourhood and also made an announcement on the local cable channel. ?We found the body on our doorstep in the early hours of Saturday,? Pasha said.

 The police say the boy was bled to death with hundreds of safety pins that were used to puncture his body; his penis was missing. ?We are investigating the killing,? said inspector K. Anand Rao of the urban police station in Adoni.

 The district police are not ruling out that the murder is another instance of human sacrifice by bounty hunters who dig around for treasures around old monuments.

 Pasha, however, suspects the second of his three children was sacrificed because of his good stars. ?Astrologers who studied my son?s horoscope said he will be a great leader and earn fame.?

 Far from Adoni, the cyber city of Hyderabad had to be reassured by police commissioner Dinesh Reddy following persistent complaints of female ghosts scaring people and stealing things from them. 

 Reddy held a midnight meeting yesterday in the old city to impart awareness against superstitions and black magic and instil confidence. ?We are not sure whether these measures will help or not. At least, people could think rationally.?

 The sightings and pilfering were reported over the last one month from Madina, Jahanuma, Yakutpura and Chatrinaka localities in the old city.

 Scared residents painted their houses with the inscription ? Stree Repu Ra ( lady, please come tomorrow)? to ward off the spirits. The inscription was also found on the doors of police stations in the minority-dominated localities.

 Savitramma, a 45-year-old housewife of Yakutpura, said that an old woman knocked on her door on Friday and asked for water. ?Before I brought the water, the old woman had disappeared with some household items from the drawing room. But I had bolted the door before I fetched the water.?

 The ghosts are also said to have eaten in local hotels and disappeared, gone marketing, and lifted luggage at bus stands and railway stations.

 After initially dismissing the incidents as the antics of some goons, city police have increased patrolling in the affected areas. The complaints, however, continue to pour in.

 ?It might be a rumour that ghosts are operating in the area. But the missing luggage and disappearing acts in certain quarters of the city must be thoroughly investigated,? said Mumtaz Ahmad Khan, an advocate and MLA from the old city.

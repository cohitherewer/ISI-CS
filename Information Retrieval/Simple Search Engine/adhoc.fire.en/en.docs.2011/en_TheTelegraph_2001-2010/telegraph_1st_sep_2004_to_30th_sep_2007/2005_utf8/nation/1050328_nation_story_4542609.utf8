 Advani skips trip to skirt rebels

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, March 27: L.K. Advani has called off his visit to the city apprehending trouble from rebel MLAs.

 His move confirmed the worst fears of the dissidents who felt the BJP president was trying to avoid them. 

 This is the third time in a fortnight that the former deputy Prime Minister has avoided talking to dissidents who have been seeking a change in leadership. 

 The rebels see Narendra Modi?s ?hand?? behind Advani?s decision as the chief minister does not want them to have a dialogue with him.

 A BJP spokesman, however, claimed that due to ?unavoidable circumstances?? Advani has postponed today?s visit. He is preoccupied in Delhi. 

 In Ahmedabad, he was to unveil the statue of BJP leader Haren Pandya, who was shot dead two years ago.

 Advani cancelled his visit to Surat on March 19 at the eleventh hour. The next day, when he was in Ahmedabad to address the Swabhimaan rally, Advani avoided the dissidents. 

 The rebels wanted to ask Advani whether the party cares for their swabhimaan (self-respect) like it does for Modi when he was denied a US visa? 

 A party insider said Advani does not know how to tackle Modi who has reduced the party to a non-existent force in Gujarat. Today, there is no BJP, only factions.

 ?The US visa episode and the cancellation of the chief minister?s UK trip have given the BJP a bad name. Obviously, Advani does not want any further trouble,?? said a BJP leader, who claims to have told the party president about the possibility of the rebels besieging him. 

 In Ahmedabad, if Advani had tried to avoid the dissidents, they would have chased him to the airport and gheraoed him. 

 It is learnt that Pandya?s widow Jagruit was insisting that the programme should be held only in the presence of Advani. 

 The rebel MLAs plan to meet in Gandhinagar tomorrow to decide their next course of action and discuss issues they want to represent before the party president.

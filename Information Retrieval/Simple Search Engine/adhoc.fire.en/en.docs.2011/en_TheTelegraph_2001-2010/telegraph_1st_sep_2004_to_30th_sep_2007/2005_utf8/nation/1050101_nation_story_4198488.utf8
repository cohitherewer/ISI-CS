The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 On empty stomach, Kerala parade before PM

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 31: The injured and the bereaved were touched by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s kind words but upset with officials who had herded them out of relief camps early in the morning on empty stomachs to meet him.

 The scene was the government hospital at Karunagapally in the worst-hit Kollam district.

 Some 300-odd of those injured in the tsunami attack were in the hospital ward while another hundred were brought around 7 am to meet the Prime Minister.

 Ganeshan Puthenparampu said the camp officials pulled them out of the relief camp at the SV higher secondary school at Clappana and left them on the hospital premises. ?There was no one to care for us and we had to shout for water,? he said. 

 Singh arrived around 11.30 am and was led to circle inspector E.K.Sabu, sitting in wheel chair, with a leg injury suffered in the course of rescue operations. 

 But K. Krishnan, part of the crowd, told The Telegraph that it was they who rescued the cops caught in a capsized vehicle.

 Doctors and nurses who had come from distant stations had to wait until noon for specific orders from the district medical officer. That was one facet of the official distraction on account of the PM visit.

 Victims complained that middlemen were snatching all benefits. They told Singh as well as chief minister Oommen Chandy that they did not want politicians to represent them at discussions on rehabilitation. They wanted the government to consult the elders of the fishing community.

 To a round of feeble applause prompted by junior foreign minister E. Ahmed, Singh iterated his government?s resolve to do all that was possible to rehabilitate the victims.

 Ganeshan Puthenparampu told this correspondent that no one had highlighted the sacrifice of his brother Lal, who had used his fibre boat to pull out dozens of people, caught in the swirl in the Travancore-Shornaur Canal, close to the beach. But Lal had lost his wife and two children in the process. 

 Several among a couple of hundred others in a relief camp at the nearby school broke down as they came to know that the Prime Minister had to leave without visiting them. 

 Singh had to share his time with victims at Muthukulam in the neighbouring Alappuzha district. To make up for this, he had view from the helicopter of the heavily-battered Azheekal beach, which is part of Alappad panchayat, where at least 147 people were dead or missing. 

 The victims have been disconsolate. In previous days, they had blocked a couple of ministers, confronted local legislator A.N. Rajan Babu who arrived late to enquire after them and heckled Opposition leader V.S. Achuthanandan who scolded them for always voting for the ruling Congress.

 From a 500-strong camp in Alappuzha, people came out and blocked the national highway on Thursday midnight following complaints of food-poisoning.

 The only local politician to come relatively unscathed from the crowd fury was the chief minister, who visited the relief camps several times and mobilised the government machinery. He is also seen to have persuaded the central government to sanction Rs 236 crore in calamity aid and other assistance.

 Sterilisation cover push

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 23: The Supreme Court has ordered the formation of a uniform insurance policy by the Centre and all states for compensation for death due to wrong sterilisation operations. 

 A three-judge bench of Justices Ruma Pal, Arijit Pasayat and C.K. Thakker also ruled that doctors with five years of experience in gynaecology alone should perform sterilisation operations as ?unregulated sterilisation methods? were increasing in the country.

 The directives came on a petition by Ramakant Rai who sought guidelines for the sterilisation procedure. The bench said this aspect of ?medical science? with a ?noble cause? of planned family has not yet been regulated by any guideline so far.

 The court noted that several states have already filed affidavits on steps taken by them to regulate the matter but there was no uniformity in the procedure and norms and the Centre should frame uniform guidelines. 

 The court said the Centre should lay down norms for payment of compensation for deaths, injuries or other medical problems due to sterilisation.

 Till a uniform insurance policy is drawn up by the Centre, the states could follow the format prepared by the Tamil Nadu government. 

 A maximum of Rs 1 lakh is now being paid as compensation in case of deaths due to sterilisation and Rs 30,000 (maximum) in the case of incapacity and post-sterilisation complications. This also varies from state to state as there is no uniform guideline.

 The apex court also directed the Centre, all states and Union territories to set up a specialist panel of doctors with five years of experience in gynaecology. The panel alone should carry out sterilisation operation, it said. 

 The court added that all state governments should prepare a check list containing the age, the health condition, the number of children and other details of the person seeking to undergo a sterilisation operation. It mandated that doctors should fill the list, explain the sterilisation process to the person and obtain consent. 

 The governments were also told to maintain a register to enter every sterilisation case and death/post-operation complications and on that basis governments should initiate an inquiry whether guidelines were followed and fix responsibility for deaths and other complications. 

 The bench has posted the next hearing after eight weeks and sought responses from the Centre, all state governments and Union territories.

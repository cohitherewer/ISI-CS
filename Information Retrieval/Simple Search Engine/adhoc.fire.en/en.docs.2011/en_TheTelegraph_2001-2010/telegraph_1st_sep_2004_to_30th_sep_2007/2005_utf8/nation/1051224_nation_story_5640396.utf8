 Rural voters to wield axe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Deshmukh: Bold step

 Mumbai, Dec. 23: As the 11 MPs caught in the cash-for-questions expos? were shown the Parliament door, the Maharashtra government has decided to give rural voters the power to wield the stick.

 The move, which could lead to reforms in the countrys political system, gives rural voters the right to recall inefficient and corrupt elected representatives in the states 29,000 local government bodies.

 The Vilasrao Deshmukh cabinet has given its consent to an amendment to the Gram Panchayat Act of 1958 that would empower voters. 

 According to the amendment, if 20 per cent of the voters in a gram panchayat file a written complaint seeking removal of the sarpanch or the deputy sarpanch, the deputy chief executive officer of the zilla parishad concerned can order an inquiry.

 Within a month of the inquiry, the deputy chief executive officer would have to file a report to the divisional commissioner. The DC would then hear both the parties and determine if the elected representative should be removed.

 The elected representative can appeal to the state government within 15 days of the DCs verdict. The government will take a decision within a month of filing the appeal.

 Zilla parishads now have the power to remove an elected representative, but the proposed amendment would ensure that senior bureaucrats facilitate the process.

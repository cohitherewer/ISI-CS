 Teachers? no to poll duty

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Jan. 18: In a blow to the state Election Commission?s efforts, the Magadh University Teachers? Association today decided to stay away from poll duty. 

 The commission had earlier sought the assistance of teachers in view of the ongoing strike by non-gazetted government employees in Bihar.

 The association, which met here today, will also endorse the decision of the Federation of University Teachers? Association of Bihar and the Federation of University Service Teachers? Association of Bihar to ensure the defeat of candidates belonging to the Rashtriya Janata Dal and its allies. 

 The association has also extended moral support to the striking government employees.

 The federations are dissatisfied with the Rabri Devi government over its perceived insensitivity to the teachers demands for improvement in their service conditions and raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 years as recommended by the University Grants Commission.

 According to a news release issued by association president Thakur Avaneendra Kumar Singh and general secretary Brajesh Kumar Roy, the vice-chancellor has been requested to convey today?s decision to the district magistrates of Gaya, Patna, Nalanda, Nawada, Jehanabad, Arwal and Aurangabad.

 The association has questioned the deployment of university and college teachers for poll duty on the ground it would reflect poorly on the fairness and credibility of the entire election process. The teachers? association of Gaya College has already passed a similar resolution. 

 Ghulam Samdani, professor-in-charge of MG College, according to sources, has written to state chief electoral officer K.C. Saha, seeking guidelines on legal and ethical implications of the deployment of affiliated college employees for election duty. 

 Since members of the college council have been contesting polls and the president of the governing body is himself a CPI candidate, it would not be proper to deploy the staff members for election duty, he contended.

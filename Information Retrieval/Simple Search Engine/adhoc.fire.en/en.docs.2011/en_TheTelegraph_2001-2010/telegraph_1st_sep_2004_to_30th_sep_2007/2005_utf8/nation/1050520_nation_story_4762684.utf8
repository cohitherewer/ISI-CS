 Finally, seal of approval on Suez of east 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Chennai, May 19: The Suez Canal of the east has been green-flagged, 145 years after it was conceived by a Briton.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs today cleared the Sethusamudram ship canal project. The Rs 2,427.40-crore canal will shrink the distance between the eastern and western coasts.

 Ships now have to go around Sri Lanka because of the shallow waters between the island nation and India. 

 The long-pending project appears to have been cleared with an eye on the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections scheduled for next year.

 Announcing the decision, finance minister P. Chidambaram said the government has fulfilled a promise in the common minimum programme and the budget. It opens up a channel that will enable ships to avoid going around Sri Lanka, he said, adding that the channel would bring benefits as was the case with the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal.

 The Chennai and Tuticorin ports stand to gain from the channel that will take at least five years to build. The canal will also address Indias strategic concerns.

 The Centre has set up the Sethusamudram Corporation Ltd as the nodal agency to raise resources and implement the project through the Tuticorin Port Trust. The project will entail a foreign exchange debt component of Rs 1,456.4 crore. The canal is the brainchild of Commander A.D. Taylor, who served in the Indian Marines ? the precursor to the Indian Navy. 

 After Independence, repeated efforts were made to implement the project. However, a rethink set in after a cyclone in 1964 washed away Danushkodi island near Rameswaram. The safety concerns are at play even now. (See chart)

 The canal is unlikely to be popular in Lanka because Colombo will lose considerable shipping business. However, the canal has no parallel with the bridge Hanuman built in the Ramayana.

 Such a bridge has been proposed from north Sri Lanka to Rameswaram but chief minister Jayalalithaa opposes it as she fears that Tamil Tiger extremists might use it to sneak into India.

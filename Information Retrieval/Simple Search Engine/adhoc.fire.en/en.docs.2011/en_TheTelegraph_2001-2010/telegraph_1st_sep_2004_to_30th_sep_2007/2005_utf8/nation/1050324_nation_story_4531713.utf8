 Pervez back to Kashmir drone

 Islamabad, March 23 (Agencies): Weeks before his visit to India, Pervez Musharraf today said peace measures like the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service would ?lose their impact? if the Kashmir issue was not solved.

 ?Between India and Pakistan, confidence-building measures and meaningful negotiations should continue. But if the real issues remain unsolved, then these confidence-building measures will also lose their impact,? the Pakistan President said.

 He was speaking at his country?s National Day military parade that was held three years after being shelved in 2002 following security concerns and India-Pakistan tension in the wake of the terrorist attack on Parliament the year before.

 ?I welcome the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus service,? Musharraf said. ?This will bring relief to the hardship of the Kashmiri people and will provide opportunities to families to meet on both sides. But this bus service is not a solution to the Kashmir issue. It?s only a step toward confidence building.?

 The two countries, he said, should explore options for a resolution ? ?which are acceptable to all parties, Pakistan, India and Kashmiri people? ? in keeping with the September 2004 statement issued after his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New York.

 Musharraf, clad in a sherwani rather than his military uniform, said support to ?Kashmiris? would be maintained.

 ?We are with the Kashmiris in their struggle. And our moral, diplomatic and political support will continue for them in their great struggle until they are successful in their great cause.?

 The Pakistan President also said both countries needed to move away from their ?complicated past? and ?display sincerity, flexibility and initiate bold measures to resolve Kashmir and other contentious issues?.

 Musharraf is expected to meet Singh when he visits Delhi next month, his second to India since the failed 2001 Agra summit, to watch the last cricket one-dayer between India and Pakistan on April 17.

 But before that, on April 7, the bus between the two Kashmirs would roll and pass through Chakothi, a village in Pakistan that shows signs of the increasing normality in bilateral relations.

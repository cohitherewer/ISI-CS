 Delhi tops Lanka list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: Sri Lankas newly appointed foreign minister Anura Bandaranaike is arriving here tomorrow for talks with the Indian leadership.

 That he has chosen India as the first country to visit as foreign minister is indication of the importance Sri Lanka attaches to relations with Delhi.

 Bandaranaike, the younger brother of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, on Monday replaced Lakshman Kadirgamar who was shot dead by a suspected Tamil Tiger gunman on August 12.

 Till recently, Bandaranaike was the industries and tourism minister. He will now be holding both the foreign and tourism portfolios.

 Bandaranaike will hold talks with many Indian leaders, including the Prime Minister, foreign minister Natwar Singh and possibly defence minister Pranab Mukherjee.

 He will return to Colombo the day after. The one-day visit is aimed at assuring Delhi of the special position it enjoys in Sri Lanka and his commitment to further the strong ties between the countries.

 India too attaches importance to its relations with Sri Lanka. An indication was that it sent its foreign and defence ministers as well as foreign secretary Shyam Saran for Kadirgamars funeral in Colombo.

 Last week, the Sri Lankan leader of Opposition Ranil Wickremesinghe was in Delhi for talks with the Indian leadership. The visits in quick succession show there is consensus among the ruling party and Opposition on the importance of India in Sri Lankan affairs.

 Although Kadirgamars assassination has raised serious concern in Delhi, it feels the killing should not be allowed to come in the way of peace talks between Colombo and the Tigers.

 Delhi has been trying to convince Sri Lanka to be firm in handling the Tigers. It wants Sri Lanka and the global community to make it clear to the Tigers that the onus is on them to show progress in peace talks and if they indulge in more violence they will be totally isolated both at home and globally.

 Court close shave for pontiffs

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chengalpattu, Sept. 5: News of the Supreme Courts orders exempting Kanchi acharyas Jayendra Saraswati and Vijayendra Saraswati from personal appearance reached the trial court here just in time to prevent an embarrassment following their absence during todays hearing.

 The Supreme Court had earlier in the day exempted the acharyas from personal appearance in the Shankar Raman murder case and asked the Chengalpattu court not to frame charges till October 4, when it hears a petition by Vijayendra Saraswati seeking transfer of the trial outside Tamil Nadu.

 Shankar Raman, the manager of the Sri Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kancheepuram, had been killed in 2004. 

 There was an element of suspense in the court of the district sessions judge, G.M. Akbar Ali, who had given a specific directive at the last hearing that all the accused should be present today.

 The advocates informed the court about the Supreme Courts directives. The sessions judge, however, sought confirmation of the developments in the Supreme Court.

 The judge said he was dispensing with the appearance of the acharyas only for today and ? awaiting the Supreme Courts order to verify its contents ? posted the case to September 12.

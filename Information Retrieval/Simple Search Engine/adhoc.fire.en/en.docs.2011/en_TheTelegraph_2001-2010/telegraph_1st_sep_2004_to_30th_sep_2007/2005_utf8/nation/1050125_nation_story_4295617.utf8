 HC orders inquiry into police inaction

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, Jan. 24: Taking yet another step to ensure ?free, fair and fearless? elections in Bihar, Patna High Court today ordered an inquiry into the failure of Bihar police to arrest former minister Surendra Prasad Yadav despite a non-bailable warrant issued by a Gaya court to this effect.

 Gaya superintendent of police Sanjay Singh appeared before the court today and pleaded his ignorance of the district court order passed by R.R. Mishra, due to which he could not arrest Yadav while he had gone to file his nomination for the Belaganj Assembly constituency last week. 

 The court had taken up the issue on Thursday while hearing a PIL filed by the Indian Medical Association. 

 The court?s directive came on an affidavit by BJP nominee from Belaganj, Mukesh Kumar, that despite the information available with the returning officer, the district administration did not arrest Yadav.

 Today, acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and S.N. Hussain ordered the inquiry. The bench has asked the district court to probe and file a report in the on January 27. 

 Elsewhere in the state, the police arrested yet another ?criminal? candidate today. BJP candidate Ananti Prasad Yadav was arrested from Araria district amid protests by his supporters. Yadav was wanted in connection with the abduction of a panchayat samiti member of Palasi block. 

 The court had directed the police on January 7 to prepare a list of all wanted absconders and arrest them before the elections. 

 In another development, higher secondary education minister and RJD legislator from Katihar, Ram Prakash Mahto, today resigned from the ministry following an arrest warrant against him in connection with a case relating to the violation of the model code of conduct during the 1999 Lok Sabha polls.

 Mahto resigned in the light of the court?s strict order for action against all absconders in the state. 

 Mahto sent his resignation to chief minister Rabri Devi this afternoon which was forwarded by her to Governor Buta Singh for acceptance, sources said.

 SC sends notice, Gaur offers victim Rs 1 lakh

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Bhopal, May 13: The Supreme Court today issued a notice to the Madhya Pradesh government on a petition seeking Rs 10 lakh as compensation for Shakuntala Verma, whose hands were chopped off allegedly for campaigning against child marriage. Hours later, the state spared only a lakh from its coffers.

 Central and state agencies woke up three days after the incident and raised a hue and cry. Verma, a supervisor in the state child and welfare department, was assaulted with a sword by an unidentified youth at her home in Rajgarh in Dhar district, 250 km from Bhopal, on Tuesday night.

 The apex court today acted on an application filed by the NGO, Forum, Fact Finding Documentation, on behalf of Verma asking for the Rs 10-lakh compensation and arrest of the accused, who is on the run. 

 The petition also sought prosecution of all officers concerned, including chief minister Babulal Gaur, for being negligent towards child marriages.

 The court issued notices to the Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh governments and the respective state human rights commissions to start inquiries into child marriages. 

 The National Human Rights Commission directed the Madhya Pradesh government to probe the incident and submit a report within two weeks. 

 Its chairperson, Justice A.S. Anand, said: It is indeed shocking that she was attacked in such a way?. It is a very serious thing. We have taken suo motu cognisance of the incident from media reports.

 The National Commission for Women, too, stepped in today with chairperson Girija Vyas calling on Verma in an Indore hospital. Holding the state government responsible, Vyas termed the attack inhuman. The point is that the woman was doing her duty, and the government is not standing by her, but by the criminals, she said. 

 The Congress leader slammed the chief minister for saying social customs like child marriage are difficult to abolish. This was not expected of the CM. He talked of the law instead of condemning what happened. Who will come forward to work in these areas now? 

 Gaur also came in for attack from the NHRC. It is very sad that the government is expressing helplessness?. We have to change the attitude, the mindset, Justice Anand said.

 The Madhya Pradesh government, however, stuck to its stand and refused to acknowledge that the attack had a direct link with child marriage. 

 BJP MP from Indore Sumitra Mahajan said: We dont know if she was attacked because of her work. She has been working in that area for the past 10-12 years, but something like this has never happened before. Besides, she was attacked inside her house, not during field work.

 Last night, women activists took to the streets in Bhopal, condemning the attack.

 Cries of protest also rang in the Rajya Sabha today with women members, cutting across party lines, speaking in one voice. 

 Chandrakala Pande of the CPM demanded a judicial probe and said Gaur should be sacked for allowing such an incident to take place in this day and age.

 Rape cuff on cop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 19: Navi Mumbai police today arrested a constable for allegedly raping a teenage bar girl, barely 24 hours after a Mumbai police head constable was held on a rape charge.

 Hameed Nazir Kazi, 35, who works with the Nerul police station, was arrested around 3 am on Wednesday after the victim, reportedly of Bangladeshi origin, accused him of raping her on October 11 and 12.

 The complaint was lodged late on Tuesday night in the presence of a news team from Sahara Samay TV channel, which had encouraged the victim and her husband Amin-ur Gazi to go to the police. 

 The channel apparently did a sting operation on the womans exploitation by the constable.

 Police sources said Kazi was recently transferred to Nerul police station and asked to be part of a drive to evict Bangladeshis staying illegally in the locality. Kazi allegedly visited the victims home and, using the threat of deportation, asked for sexual favours.

 On October 11 evening, Kazi met the woman at her aunts home in Nerul Sector 8, asked to be left alone with her in a room and raped her, the complaint says. 

 Kazi allegedly repeated the act the next day with a colleague, 35-year-old Vishwanath Velhe, who is in hiding.

 At a cabinet briefing this evening, chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh expressed concern at the growing instances of sexual offence by policemen.

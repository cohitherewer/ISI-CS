 Laloo gives Congress more seats

 Laloo Prasad: Smaller pie

 New Delhi/Patna, Sept. 27: The Rashtriya Janata Dal will contest only 175 seats in the coming elections, 40 less than the 215 it fought in February when it managed to win 75, the least in the 15 years it has ruled Bihar.

 The big gainer has been the Congress, which has got 51 seats in the bargain with Laloo Prasad Yadav. The CPM and Nationalist Congress Party will contest nine and eight seats respectively. The Bihar Assembly has 243 seats.

 The NDA partners, too, have finalised their seat-sharing arrangement with the Janata Dal (United) taking 141 seats, leaving 102 for the BJP.

 Making an announcement here today, Dal(U) leaders Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar claimed that the alliance was heading for a clear majority.

 We will not need any help this time. The NDA is headed for a clear majority, said Sharad, when asked whether the alliance would seek the support of Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party in forming the government.

 The Dal(U) also released its first list of 70 candidates for the four phases. Sharad declared that all the candidates who won in the last elections have been allotted tickets. Besides, those who defected from the LJP have also been accommodated. Some of the Independents from the LJP may contest on BJP tickets. But mostly they will fight on the JD(U) symbol, he added.

 Laloo Prasad said friendly contests have been allowed in two constituencies ? Sugauli and Bisfi ? as a rare case. The CPM will field its nominees in both seats with the Congress and the RJD opposing the Left party in one each.

 The RJDs give-and-take with the Congress depicts an interesting trend. Many of the seats we wanted have not been given to us. We have got three types of seats ? first, those we won the last time, then where we finished second, and third, places where the RJD has little influence. 

 There is also an understanding that Laloo Prasad would have a say in the selection of some of our candidates, a senior Congress leader said. He was not happy with the manner in which the Congress had succumbed to RJD pressure.

 The Congress had contested 84 seats in the last elections ? only 12 of those in a pact with the RJD. The last alliance arrangement with the CPM and the NCP was three seats each although the parties had contested 14 and 24 seats respectively. The pact is composite in the sense that none of the RJDs three partners would contest more than the number of seats that were allotted.

 The LJP has indicated that it would contest 195 seats.

 Maoist suicide threat to YSR

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Aug. 28: Security has been tightened around the secretariat and the residence of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy following reports that a suicide team of Maoists, which plans to target the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, has infiltrated into the state capital.

 Police said the six-member team is led by Ashanna alias T. Vasudev Rao, who was instrumental in the attack on Telugu Desam chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in 2003.

 Ashanna had assassinated the former Andhra home minister, A. Madhav Redddy of the Desam, in 2000 by triggering a landmine embedded in a bridge near his home town of Bhongir in Nalgonda district.

 Legislators of Telengana district have been advised to spend their nights in Hyderabad city, according to a senior intelligence official. We have told everyone to return to the state capital by nightfall even if they have adequate security, said the official.

 Eight Janashakti activists, including two women, were arrested in the chief ministers district of Kadapa today, along with guns, gelatine sticks and grenades. 

 The guerrillas were wandering around the chief ministers farm at Edupayala estate near Pulivendla, said Nagi Reddy, the police superintendent of Kadapa.

 On Friday, the chief minister reviewed the security arrangements for legislators and other political activists facing a threat from Maoists. Director-general of police Swaranjit Sen and home minister K. Jana Reddy submitted proposals for bringing 75 more people under the VIP security net that now covers 310 people, including ministers, MLAs and party chiefs.

 We have already attached 3,000 armed escorts to guard the VIPs and another 1,200 personnel are being trained and attached as per requirement, said Sen. Beginning with last week, 10 senior cabinet members, including the chief minister, have been given bullet-proof vests to wear whenever in public.

 Fifty bullet-proof cars have also 

 been commissioned in addition to the 20 already in use in 

 the state. All senior police officials in Maoist-affected 

 areas and facing an immediate threat will be given bullet-proof 

 vehicles, Sen said.

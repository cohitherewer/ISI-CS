 Stage set for poll battle

 Patna, Jan. 24 (PTI): Having failed to clinch a conclusive seat-sharing deal, the constituents of the UPA in Bihar ? the Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Lok Janshakti Party ? will be seen crossing swords in 57 of the 64 Assembly seats going to polls in the first phase of the on February 3.

 Among the 834 contestants, 58 are from Laloo Prasad?s RJD, which, apart from facing the NDA?s challenge, is also up against ?friends? in the Congress and LJP.

 While the RJD has no alliance with the LJP, the latter has hammered out a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress. Ram Vilas Paswan?s party is contesting 46 seats, leaving 18 for the Congress.

 The RJD has spared only the Kahalgaon seat held by Assembly Speaker Sadanand Singh. The party will have ?friendly fights? with the Congress in 17 seats.

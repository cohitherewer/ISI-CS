 Gender wall falls after 40 years

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: Two months ago, Brinda Karat made waves with her performance in Amu, a film on the 1984 riots. Today, she hit the political screen with her entry into the CPM politburo as its first woman member.

 It has taken the CPM four decades to break its all-male politburo syndrome.

 Even in the central committee, women have been few. In 1999, Brinda angrily quit the committee on the grounds that it was doing nothing to rectify the gender bias. She rejoined after the committee included a couple of more women. 

 But it took Brinda nine years, since her inclusion in the central committee, to breach the politburo?s gender wall. Even now, the 58-year-old leader will be the only woman in the 17-member body. 

 In the party congress, there was speculation whether Brinda would be taken in because she happens to be the wife of the new general secretary, Prakash Karat. 

 Party comrades pointed out that Brinda would enter the politburo on her own right and not as anybody?s ?wife or sister?. She has been a participant in the women?s movement and the general secretary of the All India Democratic Women?s Association. 

 Brinda has worked among women in the capital?s far-flung resettlement colonies. She organised Bharat bandhs, led demonstrations and agitated against domestic abuse. In addition, she has the right social attributes. Brinda is the sister of Radhika Roy, NDTV producer, and is a favourite of the media. 

 The former Miss Miranda is a natural before the camera with the ability to argue out a case whether on Muslim personal law or the Gujarat violence. 

 Today, at the concluding session, there was loud applause for her as R. Umanath, a politburo member, announced the names of the new entrants. Brinda was sitting with her colleague and friend Subhashini Ali when Umanath requested the new members to come on stage. 

 Ali, a central committee member, told the media during the congress that she hoped there would be more women at the top. The central committee now has three more women members and the politburo one.

 During the congress, Prakash Karat said the party would focus more on gender issues. But who will pursue them up in the politburo, he was asked. 

 ?Why? Men can also take up these issues. We are not the Communist Party of India (Males),? he replied.

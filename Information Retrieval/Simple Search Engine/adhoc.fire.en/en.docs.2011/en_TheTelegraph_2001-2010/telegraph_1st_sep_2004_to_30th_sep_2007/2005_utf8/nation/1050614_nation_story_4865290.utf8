 Risks factored in, Delhi sticks to plan

 Musharraf: Kashmir, ahoy?

 New Delhi, June 13: The government feels the blast in Kashmir that left over a dozen people dead will not derail the peace process with Pakistan.

 Sources said the Centre is trying to gauge todays explosion in the context of several important developments that have taken place recently.

 They include visits by moderate Hurriyat leaders to Pakistan with Delhis nod and the meeting between the chairman of the separatist conglomerate with Hizb-ul Mujahideen chief Salahuddin who talked tough, saying the need for armed struggle had increased.

 Last, but not the least, the sources said, is Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Siachen and his call to declare the glacier, the worlds highest battlefield, a peace mountain.

 Officials maintained that attacks like this mornings strike were expected, if not from the Hizb then from other militants groups like Al-Nasreen, Farzandan-e-Millat, the Save Kashmir Movement and Al-Arifeen which were against the trip by the Hurriyat leaders. They had earlier threatened the passengers of the peace bus.

 They chose this time because it suited them in view of the Prime Ministers Siachen visit and the Hurriyat leaders return from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on June 17. They have managed to attract attention but nothing more. Action against them will only increase now, said an official.

 That the Centre is keen on taking the peace process forward was clear from home minister Shivraj Patils response.

 This is a desperate act on the part of those who do not want the situation in the state to improve. Despite these provocations, the government would continue its endeavour to establish normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir, he said after a meeting attended by, among others, home secretary V.K. Duggal and special secretary (internal security) Anil Chaudhary.

 Two-week Pervez

 In Kuala Lumpur, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said the Kashmir problem could be solved in two weeks if India and his country show the political will to end the dispute.

 The most important thing is for the leadership to have the will to reach a conclusion and I feel that at this moment the leadership does have the desire and the will, the Pakistan President told reporters on a stopover in Malaysia en route to Australia and New Zealand. 

 Therefore, I am optimistic that it will be resolved within a certain time frame, he said, asked if the dispute could be resolved in a year or two.

 Musharraf said he would like to visit the Indian side of Kashmir but did not think the time was ripe yet to propose a trip. Lets see how things develop, he added.

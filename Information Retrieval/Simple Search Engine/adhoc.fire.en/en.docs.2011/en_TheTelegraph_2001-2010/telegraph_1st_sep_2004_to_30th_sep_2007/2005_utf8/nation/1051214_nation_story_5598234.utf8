 New Delhi, Dec. 13: The cash-for-question scam today claimed its first casualty when the Rajya Sabha suspended BJP member Chhattrapal Singh Lodha.

 In a rare display of unity, members from all parties unanimously adopted a resolution through voice vote seeking suspension of the MP caught on camera taking bribe to raise a question.

 The motion was moved by the chairman of the ethics committee, Karan Singh. Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat yesterday referred the matter to the committee soon after the sting operation was telecast by a private channel.

 Since the member has been caught on tape accepting money for asking questions, the committee unanimously recommends that Lodha should be suspended from the House pending presentation of the final report, Karan Singh said.

 The committee held a preliminary inquiry into the allegation yesterday. It also issued a notice to Lodha to explain his position within 48 hours.

 Lodha, who is from Uttar Pradesh but was elected from Orissa, is the only upper House member to be involved in the scam.

 Shahabuddin claim

 The sting operation may have created a flutter, but former MP Syed Shahabuddin smelled the rat long ago. 

 Shahabuddin, who served three terms in Parliament ? one in the Rajya Sabha and two in the Lok Sabha ? said the practice of paid advocacy through parliamentary questions and letters to ministers is quite old and widespread. He said the system of asking questions should be reviewed and an in-depth inquiry conducted.

 The former MP alleged that during his tenures, Parliament secretariat staff wrote questions for MPs for a price and even saw them through the selection process. Who knows whether they acted as conduits between outside interests and the MPs?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Riot letters under cover

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, June 17: The details of how the President of India had accused the nations Prime Minister of allowing a genocide to continue in Gujarat may never be known.

 Citing privilege, Rashtrapati Bhavan has refused to send certain documents the Nanavati Shah commission had asked for, including letters that K.R. Narayanan, as President, had written three years ago to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then Prime Minister.

 Narayanan had told a Tamil magazine in March that Vajpayees regime and Narendra Modis Gujarat administration had plotted the riots success. He had accused Vajpayee of ignoring several letters from him urging prompt and effective action.

 The interview prompted the panel to write to the former President, asking him if he had, indeed, made these statements. Narayanan wrote back to say that he had.

 Zahira called again

 The commission today decided to summon Zahira Sheikh, key witness in the Best Bakery case, again for cross-examination on July 1. She has been directed to cooperate this time and answer the questions she is asked, failing which the panel would take stern action against her.

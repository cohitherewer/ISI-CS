 Sonia stresses team work

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: A system of collective leadership may be gradually taking the place of the traditionally powerful persona of the AICC general secretary to manage Congress affairs in the states.

 AICC general secretaries have virtually lost exclusive control over party affairs in the states allocated to them since July last year when Sonia Gandhi effected the first shuffle of the party?s organisational set-up at the Congress headquarters. 

 The shuffle came in the backdrop of the party?s triumphant return to power to form the United Progressive Alliance government.

 Party leaders have taken note of Sonia?s emphasis on evolving a collective approach to decision-making on important political matters. ?It seems she wants to ensure that right decisions are made by party functionaries and for this, she is asking senior leaders to share the general secretary?s responsibilities,? said a party functionary believed to be close to the Congress president.

 Harikesh Bahadur, who was entrusted with managing party affairs in Bihar and Jharkhand in Sonia?s last shuffle, has hardly been in the forefront of decision-making on crucial aspects of the party?s election management in the two states. 

 Human resource development minister Arjun Singh, working committee member M.L. Fotedar and veteran party leader from Bihar L.P. Sahi were entrusted with the responsibility of drawing up the poll strategy. 

 ?Harikesh Bahadur was merely taking instructions from Singh,? said a Congress leader.

 Much the same way, the AICC general secretary in charge of Haryana, Janardhan Dwivedi, had to contend with party treasurer Motilal Vora as Sonia asked the veteran leader to co-ordinate the poll-related work. 

 Vora?s was the final word and not that of the general secretary.

 Similarly, in the run-up to the Assembly elections in Maharashtra last October, Sonia inducted general secretary Digvijay Singh to ?assist? the general secretary in charge, Margaret Alva. 

 By the time the polls concluded in the state, Alva virtually found herself being just one of the players. She found herself out of a core group that conducted the party?s negotiations with the Nationalist Congress Party leadership over formation of a coalition government. 

 The Congress president assigned the sensitive job to Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee, Singh and Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 More recently, it was Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi who guided the party during the crucial hours of the political crisis in Goa leading to the formation of a Congress-led government in the state though Alva looks after the affairs.

 Preferring a collective approach, the Congress president has asked AICC office bearers to meet every evening to take stock of the poll situation in Bihar and Jharkhand and come up with necessary changes to election tactics.

 The approach represents a sharp departure from the days of powerful general secretaries like G.K. Moopanar and H.N. Bahuguna who required no assistance and enjoyed full confidence of the party president.

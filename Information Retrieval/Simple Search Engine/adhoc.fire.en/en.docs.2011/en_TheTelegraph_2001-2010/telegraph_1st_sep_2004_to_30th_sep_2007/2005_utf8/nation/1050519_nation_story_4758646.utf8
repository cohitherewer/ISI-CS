 Sangma changes his mind again

 Sangma

 Guwahati, May 18: Goodbye foreign origin, hello Purno A. Sangma.

 Within days of burying the issue of Sonia Gandhis country of birth, the Nationalist Congress Party is set to welcome back one of its leading proponents.

 Sangma had helped found the NCP on that anti-Sonia plank and then walked out when the party softened its stand on the matter and got close to the Congress.

 Today, the former Lok Sabha Speaker said he would resign from the lower House as an Opposition All India Trinamul Congress member to facilitate his return to the NCP, a Congress ally.

 Sangma said the move back to the party, which he had co-founded with Sharad Pawar and Tariq Anwar ? was just a matter of time and he had already taken up some unofficial responsibilities to strengthen the party in the Northeast.

 I am ready to resign from the Lok Sabha? but I have been advised not to do so at this moment due to technical reasons, Sangma told reporters.

 He said if he vacated his seat now, he would have to wait for a few months for a bypoll, because with the advent of monsoon it might not be possible to conduct an election now.

 Sangma said he had decided to mend fences with his former colleagues in the NCP because the issue over which they had parted ways had become irrelevant after Sonia turned down her partys request to become Prime Minister.

 By turning down the offer she had actually upheld my stand, Sangma said.

 In the run-up to the last general election, the former Speaker had left the NCP in protest against its decision to forge an alliance with the Congress. Sangma had gone to the extent of saying that if Sonia became a minister he would quit politics.

 Earlier this year, Sangmas son, Conrad, unsuccessfully contested elections on an NCP ticket for the byelections to the Selsella Assembly constituency. He lost to Clement Marak of the Congress.

 Anara plea thrown out

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: The Supreme Court today refused to entertain former Miss Jammu and Kashmir Anara Gupta?s petition asking for permission to come to Delhi to argue before it the pornographic CD case in which she is embroiled.

 The 18-year-old, who was arrested for allegedly featuring in blue films and later freed on bail, has been restrained by Jammu and Kashmir High Court from leaving Jammu town till police investigations are over.

 In her petition, Anara argued the bar should be lifted as the Hyderabad forensic science laboratory had sent its finding that she was not the woman in the blue film.

 But a division bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and Tarun Chatterjee dismissed her plea, saying Anara should first approach the high court to modify its ?interim order? restraining her travel.

 Anara?s advocate Bhim Singh told the court she wanted to come to Delhi to apprise the National Commission for Women (NCW) about the ?harassment? meted out to her by police in the name of investigation. Anara and her mother were allegedly picked up at night and humiliated in the police station.

 But the apex court said it would not interfere ?at this stage? as the first forum of redress should be approached first. Bhim Singh then went to the high court, pleading Anara?s legal right would be violated if she were not allowed to come to Delhi and approach the NCW and the National Human Rights Commission.

 Anara?s petition in the Supreme Court ? filed as ?petitioner in person?, meaning she would personally argue the petition ? made several allegations against Jammu police.

 Godhra relief

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, June 3: A central review committee has ruled that the Prevention of Terrorism Act does not apply to any of the accused in the Godhra fire.

 The committee, set up by the Centre in March, agrees with the U.C. Banerjee Commission that the Sabarmati Express had caught fire by accident; there was no conspiracy to torch it.

 The decision will embarrass the Narendra Modi government, which used the anti-terror act (now repealed) against the Godhra accused but not against those charged in the riots that followed.

 The review committee, headed by Justice S.C. Jain, has directed the public prosecutor to place its opinion before the special trial court dealing with the case without any delay.

 The prosecution had not invoked the anti-terror law in its first chargesheet, submitted on May 22, 2002, about three months after the train fire. The law was already in force then, and the ordinance which preceded it had been in operation at the time of the incident.

 The committee noted that it was only in the supplementary chargesheet filed on 20.9.2002 that the prosecution invoked the provisions of sections 3(2) and 3(3) of Pota (the act) 2002. This, the committee felt, showed that the prosecution itself was not sure whether the act would apply to the case or not.

 Since the mob outside coach S-2 had gathered following the attempt by some kar sevaks to abduct a girl, it could not have been part of a conspiracy to burn S-6, the committee argued.

 So it said that even if there were a conspiracy, the entire mob could not be co-conspirators, and thus the act did not apply to the mob.

 No stay on feed share 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 21: Bombay High Court today refused to stay the Centres guidelines that make it mandatory for private sports channels to share with Doordarshan live feed of all cricket matches featuring India.

 The division bench of Justices Ranjana Desai and Abhay Oka, however, admitted Ten Sports writ petition challenging the November 11 guidelines. The channel will be immediately affected by the new rules.

 Ten Sports acquired exclusive rights for next years India-Pakistan series from that countrys board in 2003. The channel, owned by the Dubai-based Taj TV Ltd, will now be forced to share the revenues with Prasar Bharati. Besides advertisement revenues, it could lose Rs 20 crore in fixed fee.

 Sources in some advertising companies said Doordarshan, cocking a snook at Tens petition, has already begun the process of selling airtime for the India-Pakistan series.

 We have been told that interested advertisers will have to shell out Rs 250,000 for a 10-second spot during the ODIs. The rates for the Tests have been pegged at around Rs 50,000 for a 10-seconder, an industry source said.

 Prasar Bharati officials refused to comment on this.

 A Mumbai-based advertising executive said: Rates for the ODIs have been hovering between Rs 325,000 and Rs 500,000 for a 10-second schedule depending on deals the media buying agencies have managed to strike with the broadcaster. Ad spots during the Test matches are being sold at Rs 65,000-70,000. These are a shade higher than last years rates.

 Ten Sports sources said the channel had managed to sell 90 per cent of its advertising inventory. Sharing of feed would amount to a breach of trust since advertisers have paid higher sums for exclusive telecast on its channel.

 Tens counsel, Iqbal Chagla, submitted a proposal before the court saying his client was ready to provide feed to Prasar in the rural areas as an interim measure pending a decision on its petition challenging the Centres guidelines.

 In cable markets, viewers can watch the matches on our channel through cable operators. For non-cable markets like rural and remote areas, we are willing to provide Doordarshan with our decoder boxes to carry the feed on its terrestrial network, a Ten official said.

 Additional solicitor-general B. Desia, arguing for the government, said that since many homes in cities didnt have cable connection, it wouldnt be fair to limit the DD telecast of Ten feeds to rural areas. That would go against the spirit of the guidelines.

 The court indicated it would pass an order on this on Thursday.

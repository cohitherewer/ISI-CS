 Jogi Jr skeleton

 New Delhi, July 20: The cash-on-camera scandal that crushed the chief ministerial aspirations of BJP leader Dilip Singh Judeo was the handiwork of his political rivals son, the CBI told the Supreme Court today.

 The investigation agency pinned the blame on Amit Jogi, the son of Congress leader and then Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi.

 The CBI said Amit, who is also facing a political murder charge, planned the sting operation to derive political mileage just before the Chhattisgarh Assembly elections in favour of Ajit Jogi.

 In November 2003, just before the Chhattisgarh Assembly elections, the sting operation tapes surfaced in which Judeo, then minister of state for environment in the NDA government, and his secretary Natwar Rateria were seen accepting a bribe of Rs 9 lakh in a five-star hotel. 

 The bureau said that one of the suspects later disclosed that he had incurred expenses worth Rs 15-16 lakh in the entire operation to trap Judeo. 

 Till the scandal broke, Judeo was considered the BJPs chief minister candidate.

 But the controversy forced Judeo to make way for Raman Singh when the BJP won the election.

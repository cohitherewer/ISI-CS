 Navy widens ocean ring

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: The navy has forged working alliances with 13 nations in the Indian Ocean region to replenish ships and use port facilities, the chief of naval staff, Admiral Arun Prakash, said today.

 These arrangements are part of a diplomatic strategy that the navy has taken up with the foreign ministry. The navy is also restructuring its organisation to take up diplomatic initiatives.

 Admiral Prakash, giving a brief on the activities of the force on Navy Day, said exchanges with the region were being intensified with naval headquarters having created a new office of foreign cooperation, strategic concepts and transformation. An assistant chief of naval staff post of the rank of a two-star officer has been created. 

 Rear Admiral Pradeep Chauhan, the first officer to hold the post, will head two directorates ? one dealing with foreign initiatives for training, hydrographic surveys, exercises, visits and hardware transfers and the other on strategy, concepts and transformation dealing with new technologies, networked operations, joint philosophies and out of the box ideas.

 The navy chief said the force had taken up a plan to link all ships, submarines, aircraft and shore operation centres using a satellite backbone. 

 Foreign cooperation and network-centric operations were linked because the navy envisages more overseas deployments.

 Embedded within our war-fighting capabilities lies the navys crucial peacetime role of a powerful instrument of state policy. And during the past year, this has been the underlying theme of our operations and deployments. Acting in close co-ordination, and on the advice of the ministry of external affairs, we have been reaching out to our Indian Ocean neighbourhood.

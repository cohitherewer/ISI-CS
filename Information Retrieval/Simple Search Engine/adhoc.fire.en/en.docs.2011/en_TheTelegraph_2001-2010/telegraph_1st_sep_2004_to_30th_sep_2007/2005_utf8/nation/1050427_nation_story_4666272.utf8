 NGOs win tug of war with govt

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: Non-government organisation activists today won a battle against a government bid to control the voluntary sector.

 The director-general of the Council for Advancement of People?s Action and Rural Technology, Capart, L.V. Saptharishi, agreed at a special meeting to submit policy guidelines for institutional reform to its highest decision-making body for approval. 

 The autonomous council assists more than 12,000 organisations working in the rural development sector with funds and other resources.

 Activists, including Anna Hazare, Baba Amte, Bunker Roy, Mihir Shah, Hem Bhai and Nafisa Barot, had protested against the director-general?s move to foist a super-NGO body, Confederation of NGOs of Rural India (CNRI), on the voluntary sector. 

 The CNRI would enable NGOs to bypass strict guidelines relating to release of funds even though it has no legitimate or organic link with Capart. 

 The activists also protested against the manner in which new policy guidelines had been formulated and circulated without formal approval of Capart?s national standing committees, general body or its highest decision-making body, the executive committee. More than half of the 100 members of the general body, which provides overall policy guidance, are representatives of the voluntary sector. 

 To resolve these issues, Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh called a special daylong meeting of the Capart executive committee today during a three-day national summit of rural NGOs of India in New Delhi. The committee includes NGO representatives.

 After the four-hour meeting, Shah said the ministry had decided to withdraw a circular making it mandatory for NGOs seeking funds from Capart to be a member of CNRI. While Capart requires an NGO to be at least three years old, before it can receive funds, the CNRI does not. ?This would make it possible for any kind of NGO, even if it is a day or a month old to receive funds from Capart without any check on its activities or legitimacy,? said Barot.

 ?We have resolved our issues and they have said the policy guidelines will now be discussed in executive council meetings and approved in the proper manner,? added Shah.

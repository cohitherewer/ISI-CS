The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Buried minus cloth of dignity

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Gawalan, Oct. 13: When the earth shook, Nazir was reading a newspaper.

 In the beginning it was just a jhatka (jolt). Phir jor ka jhatka (a bigger jolt). I ran out shouting for the others to get out. The tree looked as if someone had caught it from the bottom and was shaking it violently. Those who could manage to flee to the open had trouble standing. The ground, normally very hard here, was wobbling like jelly, said Nazir, his face buried in his hands.

 It is inexplicable, he added, his words barely a whisper.

 Welcome to Gawalan, 15 km from Uri, where the destruction is total. The dead, mostly children, have been buried. Many without a shroud. Many in graves of three. And many are yet to be pulled out from among the ruins. The stench of death is everywhere.

 Once a picturesque hamlet close to the Line of Control, Gawalan is today a picture of desolation. With relief coming in a trickle, mainly because of the inclement weather, survivors have had no choice but to scrounge for food grain by digging into the rubble of what used to be their home.

 We are ruined, said Nazir. Raat ko bhi hila tha (It shook last night, too), he said, before looking up at the sky for divine mercy. Allah, how long will we live like this?

 The women have been given the task of separating stones from the rice that the men are salvaging from under heavy stones with bare hands. This has been their only food since the earth heaved on Saturday, destroying homes and killing thousands.

 Before the killer quake struck, 400 small houses stood in the area. Now, less than a dozen stand amid the ruins. But they are damaged from within. We cant live in them, said Yakoob, another survivor. Our lives are now useless.

 Yakoobs nephew Tanveer, 10, was among the victims. What was their crime? he asked. It was less a question than a cry of impotent rage.

 Another man, Shah, who lost two grandchildren, was in deep shock. Hamare bachchon ko kafan bhi naseeb na tha (Our children couldnt even get a shroud), he mumbled.

 The villagers said they spent three nights, exhausted and hungry, under the open sky, hoping the government would come to their help. But help is yet to arrive.

 We can survive without electricity, but we badly need shelter and food, said Yakoob. Our women and children are drenched, hungry and ill.

 Yesterday, the villagers trekked four hours to reach Jabla Bridge near Salamabad, the transit point for Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus passengers. They disrupted traffic on the bridge, stoned passing vehicles and shouted slogans against the Kashmir government, which, they said, was busy distributing relief in Uri town.

 We have no tents, no food, no water and no medicine. Our injured are crying for attention, fumed Latif, a resident.

 Homecoming

 Five Indians who took the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus two days before the quake returned home today through the Wagah border.

 The five, all Sikhs, said Muzaffarabad looked like a ghost town. We have never witnessed such a horrifying scene in our life, one of them said.

 An Indian, Basti Ram Tandon, died in the quake while another, Jagdish Ram Tandon, was wounded.

 The Indians said they were lifted from Muzaffarabad by Pakistani Air Force jets.

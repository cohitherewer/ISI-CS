 Bar brawl brews 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 13: ?First, they gave us a livelihood. And, now they want to snatch it away. Where do we go?? says Seema as the harsh April sun beats down on Azad Maidan, where hundreds of bar girls have gathered for a sit-in against the Maharashtra government?s blanket ban on dance bars. 

 The ongoing protest is likely to intensify after yesterday?s cabinet nod to the shutdown of dance bars across the state. 

 On March 31, the government had excluded Mumbai and Thane bars and declared that it will cancel licences of dance bars functioning in the rest of the state. After being criticised for allowing Mumbai and Thane bars to operate, the government last night decided to impose a statewide ban on all dance bars. 

 Bar girls and bar owners today threatened to move court if the government implements the decision by issuing a formal notification.

 ?We will wait for the government to issue the GR and then move the high court challenging the decision. We will also petition the Supreme Court, challenging the constitutional validity of such a decision which will impinge on the rights of our workers to earn their livelihood,? said Manjeet Singh Sethi, the president of the Fight for Right Bar Owners? Association.

 The Bharatiya Bar Girls? Union, which has been staging the dharna, however, has chosen a different strategy. Yesterday, it urged the National Commission for Women and the National Human Rights Commission to look into the issue. The union argued that unemployment would push an estimated 75,000 bar girls into prostitution. 

 The government is likely to issue a formal notification within two days. Running a dance bar in the state will then be a non-bailable offence punishable with three years? imprisonment. Deputy chief minister R.R. Patil said: ?We have decided to make it a non-bailable offence, if anyone decides to disobey the order.? 

 According to him, only 370 licensed dance bars exist in Mumbai, while bar industry sources peg the number of bars ? both licensed and unlicensed ? at over 1,200.

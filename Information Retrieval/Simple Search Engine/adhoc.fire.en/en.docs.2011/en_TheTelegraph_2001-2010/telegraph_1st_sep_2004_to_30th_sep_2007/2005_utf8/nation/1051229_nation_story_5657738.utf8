 New Delhi, Dec. 28: The Centre went into a tizzy after learning about the attack on the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore. 

 The home ministry could not ascertain till late tonight who was behind the attack and what the motive was. 

 Despite a Delhi police claim two days ago that a plot to attack infotech hubs had been unearthed, home ministry officials were so unprepared that most came to know of the strike through television.

 Later, the officials said at least two people were involved in the attack.

 Union home secretary V.K. Duggal said it is premature to say anything rightaway and the picture would be clear only tomorrow.

 The youths who fired at the IISc could not be identified as it was completely dark. Let us see how clear the picture gets tomorrow. We will extend all help to the state police, said Duggal.

 Duggal has asked the director-general of Karnataka police to seal all escape routes from Bangalore.

 On the basis of preliminary information, the home ministry is not ruling out the possibility of a terror attack. 

 An official said it could be an attack by a Lashkar-e-Toiba module wanting to prove it can attack even installations located deep in the hinterland of India. 

 According to intelligence sources, the institute came on Lashkars hit-list after an annual session in Lahore last year. 

 The militant outfit had decided to target the countrys economy by attacking institutions such as the IISc.

 The Prime Minister and the President expressed shock over the attack and conveyed their condolences to the family of M.C. Puri, the retired professor who was killed.

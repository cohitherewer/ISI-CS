 Jaya up in arms over Suez of east

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 25: The Sethusamudram ship canal ? dubbed the Suez of the east ?today dredged up the first hints of a Centre-state spat with Jayalalithaa declaring she would boycott its July 2 inaugural as it had been green-signalled without regard to environmental concerns.

 The announcement came as Union shipping minister T.R. Baalu chaired the inking of the first MoU between the Tuticorin Port Trust and the Dredging Corporation of India on the first instalment of work in the Palk Bay.

 Baalu has personally been supervising preparations for the Madurai inauguration which will be presided over by the Prime Minister and attended by Sonia Gandhi and DMK chief M. Karunanidhi. Jayalalithaa had also been invited.

 Lashing out at what she termed Baalus unseemly haste, Jayalalithaa accused him of bulldozing his way through the environmental clearance processes with the help of another DMK minister, A. Raja, who was conveniently in the Union environment ministry.

 She said in principle she was not against any project for the states development but could not swim along with this as it involves massive dredging of the sea floor and would jeopardise the livelihoods of several lakhs of fishermen.

 Jayalalithaa said it was shocking the Centre had cleared the project without bothering to get the mandatory no-objection certificate from her government and the state pollution control board.

 The pollution board had just submitted its report and pointed out a number of deficiencies, she said. The impact of dredging and oil spills on marine life ? the Gulf of Mannar is a protected area ? had to be studied before clearance is given, she said. 

 But with callous abandon, Baalu had converted the project into a political roadshow, she alleged.

 Although there is little doubt about Jayalalithaas concern for her people, experts say she is not likely to be happy that Baalu ? of the rival DMK ? has stolen a march on her a year before the Assembly polls. Baalu termed her charges unfortunate.

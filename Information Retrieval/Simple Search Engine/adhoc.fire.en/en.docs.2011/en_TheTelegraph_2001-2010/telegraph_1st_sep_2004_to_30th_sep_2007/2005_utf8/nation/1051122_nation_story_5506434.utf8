 Tense family keeps chin up

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 21: Raman Kutty is worried what the Taliban might do to his son but he is keeping his chin up.

 He has to come back or who will take care of us? I am a heart patient and his mother, in bed since she heard the news, is a cancer patient, he said as his family sat glued to TV, awaiting the next bit of news.

 They had heard the Taliban had given the Border Roads Organisation ? with whom R. Maniappan was working as a driver ? 48 hours to stop work on the road linking Afghanistan to Iran, so they were anxiously counting the minutes.

 Kuttys son Maniappan was abducted allegedly by the Taliban when he and three others had been on way to Nimroze province on Saturday. He had joined the BRO 14 years ago and is the sole breadwinner of the family.

 The only relief yet was the BRO in Delhi was keeping the family informed, Kutty said. Chief minister Oommen Chandy had also called on them and assured them help, he said.

 But his daughter-in-law Bindu was disconsolate. The last time she spoke to her husband was on November 8, she said, wiping away tears. The couple has two sons, Vishnu and Appu, nine and three years of age.

 Bindu said before leaving for Afghanistan, her husband had given her a friends phone number so that she could contact him in an emergency. But he had told her it would take a while before he got back as the message would take time to reach.

 The last time he was home was in May, she said, and was supposed to come again this month when the transfer orders came. Maniappan had been posted in Meghalaya so far.

 Kutty said his son had been quite pleased with the Afghan posting because the money was better than what he was getting in Meghalaya and would come in handy to renovate the house.

 Maniappan had joined the BRO as a 20-year-old, he said.

 Chandy said he was in constant touch with the PMO and had faxed a message expressing Keralas concern.

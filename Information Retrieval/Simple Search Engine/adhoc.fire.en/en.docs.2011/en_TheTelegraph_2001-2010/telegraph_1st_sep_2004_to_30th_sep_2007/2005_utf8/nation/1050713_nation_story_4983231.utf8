 New Delhi, July 12: The National Council for Teacher Education today submitted before the Supreme Court a report which said an all-India curriculum will be framed to generate environmental awareness among students.

 The move followed a contempt petition filed by environment lawyer M.C. Mehta.

 Mehta, who had won the Magsaysay award for his work in environment-related cases, said the council was sleeping over the matter though the court had directed inclusion of environment as a compulsory subject at all levels nearly 10 years ago.

 Today, the councils report submitted along with an affidavit said environmental education, as a compulsory subject for teachers education, will be implemented to develop critical awareness about pressing problems of life, especially environmental degradation, its consequences and ways to check it.

 It is agreed the world over that education can play an important role in developing environmental awareness if it is incorporated in the curricula and courses of studies for which teachers have to be prepared, the report said.

 Court keeps up pressure on squatter VIPs

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Supreme Court today held up the example of Britain to prod the Centre on evicting squatter VIPs from government accommodation, making it clear that unauthorised occupants should be dealt with according to the law.

 A two-judge bench gave the Centre time till January 24 to take necessary steps. 10 Downing Street, London, is an example. The moment the Prime Minister loses the office he leaves that.? We should also follow, the bench of Justices B.N. Agarwal and A.K. Mathur told solicitor-general Gulam E. Vahanvati. You (the Centre) do whatever you have to do, the judges said.

 If they (unauthorised occupants) do not understand the language of gentleman, then they must be dealt with according to law, they added. It is these persons who have made the law and are violating them.

 Earlier, the court asked Vahanvati about the progress the government has made in evicting the unauthorised occupants. The solicitor-general said 117 of the 465 squatters have been evicted and also informed the bench that Bihar governor Buta Singh, who had come under severe criticism for not vacating his Delhi bungalow, has also vacated the premises.

 The Centre, however, said the home ministry has recommended continued occupation of government accommodation for former Punjab police chief K.P.S. Gill and Youth Congress leader M.S. Bitta till April 2006 because of security threats. 

 The recommendation was yet to be placed before the cabinet committee of accommodation for regularisation, it added.

 The government also said it would move an application before Delhi High Court requesting it to dispose of within two months the 88 cases of unauthorised occupancy pending before it. The bench then adjourned hearings till January 24.

 We are adjourning the matter and expect that many more quarters held unauthorisedly will be vacated, the judges said.

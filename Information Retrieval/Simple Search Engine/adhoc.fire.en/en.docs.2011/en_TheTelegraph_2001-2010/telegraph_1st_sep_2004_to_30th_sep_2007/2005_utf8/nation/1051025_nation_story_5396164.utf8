 Metro private guard shoots teen thief 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: An armed 16-year-old was shot dead by a private security guard as he tried to steal construction material at a Metro railway site.

 Work is on at a furious pace in west Delhis Dwarka-Barakhamba section, where the incident occurred, to complete Phase I of the Metro.

 The incident took place around 3 am today when five persons ? the teenager was part of the gang ? tried to sneak in through a duct on an under-construction elevated line between Kirti Nagar and Shadipur.

 Metro authorities said cases of pilferage were quite common in this section and they have caused delays and financial losses. 

 Actually, we have had complaints of pilferage in these areas before. Shadipur, Uttam Nagar and Tilak Nagar are prone to thefts. The thieves come to steal cables and metal plates. We were aware of this and this is why we posted armed guards, said Anuj Dayal, the chief public relations officer of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. 

 When Kameshwar Narayan Singh, a Group 4 security guard, spotted the five this morning, he challenged them. They fired at him with country-made pistols before attacking him with sticks. He was wounded in the head.

 Singh, who was armed with a .12 bore gun, fired back and injured 16-year-old Sikander. He was declared brought dead when taken to hospital. The others escaped, police said. 

 The security guard was hospitalised in a serious condition. But by evening he was said to be out of danger. 

 The Metro authorities have ordered an inquiry into the incident, a statement of the metro rail corporation said. 

 Last year, a gang carrying a men at work sign had stolen iron grille dividers worth Rs 15 lakh from the Rithala Metro station right in front of a police picket, police sources said.

 The thieves had piled the dividers, more than a kilometre and a half long, on a tempo and driven away. Although the matter was reported to Rohini police station, no FIR was registered. 

 Security at Delhi Metro has been under the scanner of the Union home ministry following the London bombings on July 7, 2005.

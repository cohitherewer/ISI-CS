 New Toefl format ruffles aspirants

 Boston (AP): A revision in an English language exam has many applicants ? particularly Asians ? worried that they will be disadvantaged because of how they were taught the language in school.

 The Toefl exam is taken by students hoping to study at English-speaking universities.

 The new Toefl IBT (Internet-based test) debuts on Saturday in US test centres and will be phased in worldwide next year.

 In recent years, many of the 5,200 English-speaking colleges and universities of the world that use the exam have been concerned that the test fails to identify students who master only textbook English.

 The biggest change is a new speaking component, with the focus on how well students read, write and speak in combination. Students may be asked to listen to a recording and read a passage, then to speak about both. 

 The changes have some students nervous, particularly those from Asia, where schools stress on vocabulary and grammar over speaking.

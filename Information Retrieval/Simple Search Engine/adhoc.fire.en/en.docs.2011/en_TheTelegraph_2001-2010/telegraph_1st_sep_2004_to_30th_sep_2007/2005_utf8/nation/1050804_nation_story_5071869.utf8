 Tough US nut cracked: PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: Separating civilian and military nuclear facilities will not stymie the countrys nuclear weapons programme, the Prime Minister said today.

 Dispelling doubts voiced by ally Left and rival NDA over the July 18 Indo-US pact, Manmohan Singh told the Lok Sabha the country would retain its strategic autonomy.

 Both the nuclear and the scientific establishments had endorsed the framework envisaged in the joint statement, he said while replying to a debate initiated by A.B. Vajpayee.

 Singh gave a point-by-point clarification, putting in perspective his initiative to deepen ties with the US. The CPMs Rup Chand Pal had voiced fears of a perceived pro-American tilt in foreign policy.

 Our objective is to shape a multipolar world. We have to work with others for this. Ties with the US are of great importance (because) the US influences the international environment, he said.

 But Indias engagement with the US would not be at the cost of other countries, he said. We have great ties with Russia, China and Japan. We are not ganging up against China.

 Saying his US visit was his most challenging assignment since his maiden 1991 budget, he said he had been clear about two things when he left for America on July 16.

 One, never to compromise on the countrys independent nuclear weapons programme; and two, to explore possibilities of cooperating with the US in the nuclear energy sector. He had managed both, he said.

 As for separation of the civilian and military programmes, it would help India to develop the nuclear energy sector, he said.

 Our nuclear establishment has agreed. It will be voluntary. The determination will be made by India, by our scientists. It will be a phased identification. It will take time. It will be so phased that our strategic programme will be safeguarded.

 He clarified that Indias offer to work with the US on a fissile material cut-off treaty would be only under the aegis of the UN. Singh said the pact would ensure that shortage of nuclear fuel was a thing of the past. Even if the US Congress created problems for President George W. Bush, he would work with other countries to meet Indias needs.

 Naxalite head rolls for peace talks 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Oct. 9: The CPI (Maoist) secretary of the Andhra Pradesh unit, Ramakrishna, has been removed from his post for failure in the peace talks with the state government. 

 His place has been taken by 47-year-old Madhav, a Naxalite commander known for being inseparable from his AK-47. He is an expert in guerrilla warfare and is credited with making peace with tribals in Adilabad and Dandakarayna where he worked for over a decade.

 Ramakrishna alias Akkiraju Hargopal had led his unit in several major offensives since the imposition of the ban in 1992 but is now without a portfolio. 

 According to the recent five-day plenum of the Naxalite outfit and the central committee that met in the forests of Telengana, Ramakrishnas initiative for peace talks was hasty and damaging to the movement. He has been assured of induction in the central committee.

 The indiscriminate violence by the state police machinery has been the only fallout of the peace dialogue during which our leaders swooned in the media limelight, said a senior CPI (Maoists) leader on condition of anonymity.

 The partys central committee also feels that the outfit suffered in terms of manpower, arms and resources due to the peace talks. It appeared as if the government identified our hideouts and dumps during the peace talks period and ransacked all of them later, the leader said.

 The selection of Madhav, a grassroots Dalit leader, is also being seen as a shift from the upper-caste monopoly in the Maoist leadership since the Naxalite movement began in the early eighties. 

 The police intelligence sees Ramakrishnas removal as a move to bring in a hardliner. Madhav is a native of Karimnagar and closer to Ganapathy, the secretary of central committee of CPI(Maoists). Observers say Madhav alias Mallanna would suit the outfits strategy to strike at the state government after suffering reverses in the last few months.

 Andhra chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, on the other hand, has been lauded for his peace initiative by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi at the recent chief ministers conclave in Chandigarh.

 12-hour days for new CM 

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Dec. 4: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has decided to lead his team from the front: he has been putting in a record 12 hours at work looking at pending files.

 Just a month in the hot seat, and Azad believes he has managed to restore some bit of the lost work culture in the state.

 My priorities are to bring back normalcy. That might not happen in a day, but I can assure you work culture has already returned to the administration, he said in Jammu today.

 Topmost on his regimes list of priorities is weeding out corruption. The axe has started falling on corrupt officials.

 It is time corrupt and non-performing officials made way for thousands of educated unemployed youth who are waiting for their chance.

 A few days ago, Azad had personally shut the gates of the civil secretariat in Jammu to keep out late-comers.

 When the chief minister is in office dot on time, there is no reason why officers should be allowed to report late for duty, a secretariat official said.

 In the past month, Azad has been holding long meetings, reviewing the performance of several departments. Many officials have since been on their toes.

 The real problem for the chief minister could be that he has very few dependable tools to work with. The state was recently listed as the most corrupt Indian state after Bihar, a newspaper editor said.

 Before Azad, many newly sworn-in chief ministers have spoken of crusades against corruption in the past. But such loud promises have generally died down. Often, they are left with no option when their ministers are found to be not clean.

 Discipline and authority is a waterfall. It must start from the top, a National Conference politician said.

 Still, we must encourage the chief minister. It is after many years that we are hearing things like this. Simply dismissing the idea as impossible will only strengthen the hands of sharks that have been eating the very vitals of our system, Congress activist Nazir Ahmad said.

 In step with Azad, the man on the street, too, believes the only way to weed out corruption is to strike at the top.

 Sending middle-rung and junior officers home on corruption charges will only embolden big players that they are beyond the governments reach. If a few heads roll at the top, those at the middle and bottom will automatically start behaving, said Ali Mohammad, a local contractor.

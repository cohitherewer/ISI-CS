 Child bride gets a divorce

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, June 13: As 14-year-old Susheela removed the thalli bottu ? the wedding band ? from around her neck, the significance was hard to miss.

 The curse of child marriage, which cut off a woman activists hands a month ago in Madhya Pradesh, had just lost a trial in a peoples court in backward Telengana.

 I dont want to live with my husband who gets drunk and beats me. He also has relations with another woman, the Dalit girl had pleaded. I want separation and the opportunity to continue my studies.

 The panchayat at Chevella, Ranga Reddy district, decided in the class VII dropouts favour yesterday.

 The divorce ceremony was held under the watchful eyes of the media, police and local revenue officials and mediated by an NGO, the M. Ventaramaiah Foundation.

 B. Ramchanderji and Veeraiah, sarpanches of Aluru and Prodattur (the villages of the girl and her husband), were present. Along with sub-inspector Tirupati Raju and the social activists, they signed the document that asked the groom to return the dowry ? gold, cash, a bicycle, cooking vessels, a sleeping cot and a table fan.

 Asked how they could sign a divorce document when the marriage itself was illegal, Ramchanderji replied: We are only authenticating the agreement for separation and return of dowry.

 Susheela had walked away from Narasimhulus home six months ago and approached police for help. She said she was very happy that she was free to continue her education. 

 He (Narasimhulu) is illiterate, she said. He didnt want me to study. Most of our fights were over my education.

 Child marriages are as common in this stretch of Telengana as in Madhya Pradeshs Dhar, where a youth had hacked Shakuntala Vermas hands for protesting against the custom. Here, Dalit parents marry off their girls early to protect them from the lust of upper caste louts.

 Our womenfolk are always insecure as the feudal culture of Reddy farmers (landed gentry of Telengana) continues even today, said Venkaiah, Susheelas father.

 On May 19 and 20, nearly 97 such child marriages were conducted in the Chevella region, the site of the panchayat.

 Nobody tells us till the weddings are over, said sub-inspector Raju. We cant intervene later for fear of creating a communal problem.

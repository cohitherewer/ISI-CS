 Snag grounds London flight 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: An Air-India flight to London was stranded at Calcutta airport today after the nose wheel of the aircraft got stuck while it was being steered back from the bay to the taxiway.

 The Boeing 777 aircraft was scheduled to take off with 277 passengers from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at 11.15 am after it flew in from Dhaka.

 Airport sources said the nose wheel got stuck and bent while the plane was being pushed back by a tow-bar tractor to the takeoff point.

 The aircraft got stuck because of a technical snag, an Air-India official said. 

 Our engineers have flown in from Delhi on an Indian Airlines flight and will take up the repair work, he added.

 The official said the plane is expected to leave for London tomorrow morning, and all the passengers have been put up in city hotels.

 The airport sources said after the wheel got stuck, it was difficult to remove the aircraft from the bay, causing parking difficulties for other planes.

 Finally, around 3.15, local Air-India engineers moved the aircraft to a less important bay. 

 The damaged taxiway was later repaired.

 A few days ago, an Air-India aircraft from Calcutta to Mumbai was stranded the whole day at the airport after its public address system crashed.

 The pilot had detected the fault before takeoff early in the morning.

 Engineers from Mumbai had to be flown in with spare parts and the flight ultimately left late in the evening.

 Air-India officials said it was too expensive to keep all the spare parts of a flight at every terminal. Therefore, they have to be brought from other centres when problems like this arise.

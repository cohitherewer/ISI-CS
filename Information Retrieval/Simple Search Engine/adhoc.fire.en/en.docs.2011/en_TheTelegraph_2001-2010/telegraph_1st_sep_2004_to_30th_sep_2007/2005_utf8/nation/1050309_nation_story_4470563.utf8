 Varsity in central status plea

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, March 8: Authorities of Magadh University have sought central status for optimum utilisation of the existing infrastructure and realisation of its potential.

 Speaking at the inauguration of the distance education directorate on Saturday evening, vice-chancellor Shamshad Hussain claimed that the university has the infrastructure to claim central status. 

 With the creation of the directorate, the long-awaited distance education project has finally seen the light of day. The university will offer courses in 18 new disciplines, most of them falling in the vocational category.

 The courses that would be on offer include MBA, MCA, BCA, postgraduate management diploma with specialisation in human resource, marketing, tourism and travel, personnel, export and finance and PG diploma in mass communication and journalism.

 Unfolding the university?s plans, the vice-chancellor said they would offer B.Ed and M.Ed courses through the directorate and set up a centre for counselling and rehabilitation.

 Hussain also made it clear that there will not be any additional burden on the exchequer as the new courses will be funded under the self-financing scheme.

 Though the nitty-gritty of the fee structure is yet to be finalised, the vice-chancellor said it will be student-friendly and the university will take special care to ensure that education does not become unaffordable for students coming from the weaker sections of society.

 By introducing distance education courses, Hussain said, the university is trying to cater to the needs of those who are not in a position to pursue classroom education. Distance education will supplement conventional studies, he added.

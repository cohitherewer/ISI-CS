 Hunt for four in hall blasts

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 24: Police are looking for two men and two women who they suspect are behind the twin cinema hall blasts that rocked the capital on Sunday.

 The explosions killed one person and injured around 70. 

 Both the halls ? Liberty Cinema and Satyam multiplex ? were running Jo Bole So Nihaal, starring Sunny Deol. 

 The film had run into controversy as its title, which is part of a Sikhs daily prayer, had angered Sikh religious bodies. 

 Security guards at Liberty Cinema have given statements that two couples were seen leaving the hall minutes before the blast, according to police sources. 

 The police have also drawn up portraits of the four, which, however, will not be released to the press as their identities have not yet been established and it is still not clear if they had a role in the blasts.

 The police are still awaiting details on the device used for the explosion. 

 Joint commissioner of police, special cell, Karnail Singh, said: The details of the timer used in the device will tell us if there were two groups operating or only one. Right now, we are not ruling out either possibility.

 The involvement of Punjab militant groups is also not being ruled out. 

 The two male suspects have been described as being in their forties. One was wearing a turban and the other a patka (also a kind of turban worn by Sikhs). 

 They had entered (Liberty Cinema) through the entry for the Rs 20 ticket-holders where there were metal detectors but the checking was not very thorough. They left through another exit, said a police official. 

 The police are also waiting for forensic reports on the blasts, which will help in establishing details of the crime and also shed light on the group behind the act.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Scanner on Jana Gana... in films

 - SC to set anthem rules

 Reel Row: A scene from Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... 

 Imagine Shakti Kapoor, Gulshan Grover and all the rest of the baddies in a film sequence standing up when Jana Gana Mana rings out.

 Well, it could just happen, though you in the audience need not follow suit.

 The Supreme Court today decided to examine if the national anthem could be exploited commercially by film-makers and how it should be depicted on celluloid.

 Along with these, it will examine if actors should stand up when it is sung.

 A three-judge bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia made these decisions while hearing a review petition on so-called abuse of the anthem in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham....

 We will hear the petition on all points except the certificate issued for screening of the film by the central board for film certification, it said.

 The court has already settled the controversy over the commercial use of the national anthem in this particular film, holding that the audience was not required to stand up when it was sung in K3G and will not go into that question again.

 The review petition, filed by Shyam Narayan Chouksey, had sought confirmation of the Madhya Pradesh High Court order instructing producer Yash Johar and director Karan Johar to delete that portion of the film where the anthem was sung.

 According to the petitioner, the national anthem was sung in the film in a disrespectful manner and the audience in theatres never stood up. The high court had ordered that the entire scene be deleted, but on appeal by film-makers, the Supreme Court allowed screening and held that the audience need not get up when the national anthem was sung in the film.

 The petitioner sought a review of that order, on which notices were issued today, and the court expanded the scope of the petition by deciding that commercial use of the anthem in films and the manner in which it should be depicted should be decided once and for all.

 Former Chief Justice V.N. Khare said the question of depiction of the anthem in a film had already been settled. Khare was the judge who had decided that the audience need not get up when the national anthem is sung in a film.

 Khare said depiction of the national anthem or for that matter the national flag in a film or even exhibiting it on ones person would not be any crime. He recalled industrialist Naveen Jindals battle for flying the national flag on ones car or on ones rooftop, describing it as an exhibition of patriotic and nationalist sentiment.

 Can you call depiction of Bharat Mata in a film or a novel or any other creative work or even in a non-creative situation, like exhibiting Bharat Mata in ones house, commercial exploitation?

 It is ones sentiment... you call it nationalist or patriotic or ones feeling for ones country.

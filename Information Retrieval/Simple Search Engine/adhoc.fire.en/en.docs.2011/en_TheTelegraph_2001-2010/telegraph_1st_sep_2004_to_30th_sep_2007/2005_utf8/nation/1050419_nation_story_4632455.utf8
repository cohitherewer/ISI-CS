 Dogs amp; owners welcome at pet?s shraddh

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, April 18: Unescorted men and women not allowed. They can only accompany their dogs.

 The open invite is for a feast-cum-last rites of Mounica, a pet Pomeranian, who died on Friday. Its grief-stricken owner, Vijaya, put in an advertisement for the ceremony in local dailies the day her pet was cremated.

 The feast will be held at a hall in Vijayawada on Wednesday.

 Mounica, who died after a stomach operation, is survived by Reema and Ruma ? her puppies ? and, of course, Vijaya, a 38-year-old divorcee.

 Over 300 residents of the coastal town attended the funeral. Vijaya cried like a child as her pet?s garlanded body lay in a coffin in the drawing room of her apartment for all dog lovers to come and bid goodbye. 

 Later, the body was taken to the banks of the Krishna where priests chanting Vedic hymns purified it according to Hindu rites.

 Mounica had been Vijaya?s constant companion since she separated from her husband. She was a gift from Vijaya?s parents after the schoolteacher left Delhi and settled in Vijayawada.

 Vijaya has written to nearly 2,000 members of the Vijayawada Canine Club to participate in the last rites of her pet. 

 The small print in the invite says they are all welcome but only with their pets. A special arrangement ? dog menu ? has been made at the hall.

 ?Mounica was more than a daughter to me. I have to respect her wishes to feed a minimum of 100 dogs on her shraddh,? said Vijaya, who has decided not to remarry.

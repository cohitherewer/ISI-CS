 Jayalalithaa: Is Kanchi next?

 Chennai, Jan. 17: The Tamil Nadu government has taken over a mutt in Kumbakonam in a move that could have a bearing on the institution in Kanchi and will help it assess public reaction.

 The Jayalalithaa regime took over the administration of the mutt belonging to the Veera Saiva sect for ?alleged funds misappropriation and mismanagement?. The mutt has a sizeable following in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and is supported by the Lingayats.

 It has now been brought under the ?administrative control? of the HR and CE (State Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department) deputy commissioner, who is also in charge of the Murugan temple at Swamimalai, near Kumbakonam.

 Sri Saranga Desigendra Swamigal, the ?peetathipathi (mutt head)?, handed over the reins to the HR amp; CE department official following a local court order in a civil suit instituted against the mutt, official sources in Swamimalai said.

 The change in the mutt administration has taken place quietly, but the peetathipathi has been allowed to stay in the mutt premises till Friday. Media in Kumbakonam learned of the development two days ago.

 This would not have attracted much notice but for the controversy at the Kanchi mutt, where both Jayendra Saraswati and his deputy, Vijayendra Saraswati, face charges over the murder of Shankar Raman, the manager of the Sri Varadaraja Perumal temple. The state government is also considering legal action against the Kanchi mutt.

 The seer today moved Madras High Court seeking to restrain the government from ?interfering? in the mutt?s affairs by freezing its accounts and those of its trusts. 

 Injury report rap

 The Supreme Court has asked the state to file an ?injury report? in the Radhakrishnan assault case involving the Kanchi seer. 

 It gave the state counsel two weeks to file the documents and posted the case for hearing thereafter.

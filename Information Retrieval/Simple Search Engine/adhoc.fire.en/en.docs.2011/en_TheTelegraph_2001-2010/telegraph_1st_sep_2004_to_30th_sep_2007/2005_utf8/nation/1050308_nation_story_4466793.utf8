 Dawn raid on Naxalites

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 

 Hyderabad, March 7: Eleven Naxalites were gunned down as police swooped on the venue of a secret meeting in a forest in Nizamabad district on a day the rebels triggered a blast in a railway station and killed a constable elsewhere in Andhra Pradesh.

 In Manani forest, which blankets a hillock, among those killed early this morning were Ramesh alias Gangula Venkatswamy, the CPI (Maoist) district secretary and member of the provincial militia that operates in the Andhra-Orissa border, and four women.

 Two rebels, who managed to escape the exchange of fire, were caught in the evening. Director-general of police Swaranjit Sen said the police are still chasing a trio. 

 The Naxalites destroyed the station at the pilgrim centre of Annavaram, about 60 km from Rajamundhry in East Godavari district, and damaged signalling equipment, disrupting trains. There were no casualties. 

 Claiming credit for the blast, the rebels said it was in protest against last week?s arrest of their leader, K. Sheshagiri Rao, from a hotel in Rajamundhry.

 In Saleru town of Visakhapatnam district, the rebels killed a police constable when he was returning after sending his son to school.

 Since their leaders walked out of a peace initiative in January and the police killed a dozen of them, the rebels have been on the rampage in Andhra. Almost 60 people have been killed since, including 35 Naxalites.

 Nizamabad superintendent N. Madhusudhan Reddy said the Greyhounds ? the anti-Naxalite force ? zeroed in on the extremists. Several weapons, including an AK-47 rifle, and ammunition were found at the encounter site.

 Following on information that the Maoists were planning a campaign of ?unrest? in Telengana district, the police raided the hillock where three ?action teams were in conclave?, said Sen.

 Over 100 policemen participated in the offensive ? about 150 km from Hyderabad ? that lasted over six hours.

 The Andhra police have their fingers crossed. Sonia Gandhi is slated to be in Rajamundhry, about 50 km from Annavaram, on March 16. 

 After laying the foundation stone for the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, the first such private sector project, off Hyderabad, the Congress president will address a women?s welfare conference not very far from this morning?s blast site. 

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy said: ?The emotional campaign of the Maoists has not paid dividends for decades. We want our prodigal sons to return to mainstream and help the poor and weak to reap the fruits of democracy.?

 Reddy also said there has been no decision yet on the reimposition of the ban on the Maoists but ruled out a second round of peace talks saying the ?atmosphere? was not ?conducive?. The state police officers? association wants the ban to be back.

 The police have cautioned legislators and politicians, especially those who were on a Shivratri vacation in their home towns, against attacks. 

 They have also been asked to follow police guidelines before accepting gifts or attending programmes in view of the alert. They have also been warned against visiting remote villages.

 Security has been stepped up at the secretariat, the chief minister?s residence, legislators? hostels and programmes to be attended by ministers. Police pickets have also been placed at former chief minister and Telugu Desam leader Chandrababu Naidu?s house.

 Yechury convoy stoned in Nepal

 Kathmandu, Sept 28: About 150 supporters of Nepals royalist government threw stones at the cars of an Indian political team visiting the kingdom on Wednesday but no one was hurt, witnesses said.

 The Indian team was led by CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury and included CPI member D. Raja and D.P. Tripathi of the Nationalist Congress Party.

 The team representing four parties that support the UPA government in Delhi arrived in Kathmandu to back Nepals political parties against King Gyanendra who sacked the government and seized power on February 1.

 They (protesters) tied black cloth around their heads and threw stones as the Indian politicians drove from the airport, journalist Dipak Rijal said. But no one was hurt.

 But a police officer said he had no reports of stones being thrown at the Indian team.

 Down with foreign interference, the demonstrators shouted, saying Indian politicians had no right to interfere in Nepals internal affairs.

 The Indian team will meet leaders of Nepali political parties protesting against the kings move that resulted in the jailing of politicians and the suspension of civil liberties.

 Gyanendra has justified his actions, saying he had to act to crush an anti-monarchy Maoist revolt which has left 12,500 people dead since 1996.

 Indian parties, particularly the communists, are pushing their government to take a tougher stand against the king and demanding India press him harder to restore democracy in the landlocked nation.

 We are lending our support and solidarity for democracy which, we think, is important not only for Nepal but also for the region and the world, Yechury told reporters. We want the restoration of democracy in Nepal, he said.

 But late last evening, the palace-backed cabinet decided to ask the Indian politicians not to address any public meeting. The decision was conveyed to the delegation as soon as it landed in Kathmandu.

 The royalists today lashed out at the visiting team. A front page report in the government-owned English daily Rising Nepal quoted some of them as saying that the visit amounted to interference in Nepals internal affairs. 

 The state-run Nepal Television ran interviews of leaders of the pro-palace Rashtriya Prajatantra Party who criticised the Indian teams visit.

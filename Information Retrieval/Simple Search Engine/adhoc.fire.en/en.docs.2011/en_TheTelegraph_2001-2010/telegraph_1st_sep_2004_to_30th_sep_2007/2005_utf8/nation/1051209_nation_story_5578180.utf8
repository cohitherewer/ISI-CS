 Now, its cattle drain to Dhaka

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: After brain drain, its cattle drain.

 India has realised, at last, that Bangladesh is milking its cows. The government has woken up to the large-scale cattle smuggling across the porous border and is planning a legislation to stop mass inter-state transportation of the bovines.

 The idea is to put an end to cattle smuggling from Indias hinterland and stop Bangladeshs economy from reaping the dividends, said a senior home ministry official.

 On every cattle smuggled, the Bangladesh government earns 400 taka through stamp duty. According to our estimates, more than a million cattle, mainly oxen and buffaloes, are smuggled from India to Bangladesh every year. It earns the Bangladesh government more than 40 crore taka, the official added.

 Last year, the BSF, with the help of local authorities, seized over one lakh cattle, which is 10 per cent of the total bovines smuggled to Bangladesh in a year.

 According to home ministry sources, cattle smuggling was responsible for most of the exchange of fire between the BSF and its Bangladesh counterpart, the BDR, in the past three years. Over 40 per cent of the breaches in the border fence in 2003 and 35 per cent last year were because of cattle smuggling, they said.

 The BSF has identified 68 corridors through which cattle are smuggled into Bangladesh. Of these, 41 are in south Bengal, 10 in north Bengal, six in Assam and the rest in Tripura and North Kachar hills.

 We have so far managed to plug 52 corridors ? 31 in south Bengal, nine in north Bengal, all six in Assam and six in Tripura and the Kachar hills. The rest that lie in difficult terrain will be blocked in due course of time, a home ministry official said.

 The ministry has also asked state governments to relocate cattle sheds near the border to deeper inside Indian territory as intelligence reports have said the cattle are first brought there before being smuggled across. The states are also being advised to brand cattle in border districts.

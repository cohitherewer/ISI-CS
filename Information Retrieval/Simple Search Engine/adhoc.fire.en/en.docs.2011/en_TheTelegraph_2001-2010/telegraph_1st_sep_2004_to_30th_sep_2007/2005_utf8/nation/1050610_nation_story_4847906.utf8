 China in no rush for UN vote

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI 

 Beijing, June 9: China is not opposed to India entering an enlarged UN Security Council but does not want a rushed vote on the draft resolution that the Group of Four (G4), comprising India, Brazil, Japan and Germany, circulated last month on the expansion of the Security Council. 

 The resolution had called for the number of permanent seats in the Security Council to be increased to six. An early vote on the resolution, in the Chinese view, is not conducive to the solidarity of UN members and runs counter to the original intention of the UN reforms. 

 Explaining the Chinese position on UN reforms during an hour-long interaction with a group of visiting Indian journalists, Chinas vice-minister for foreign affairs, Wu Dawei, today said his country wanted the UN reforms to be comprehensive. Developing nations and the development agenda should have a more important place in the reforms, Wu said. 

 During his visit to India in April, the Chinese Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao, though, had supported Indias bid for a permanent Security Council seat. 

 Wus remarks came a day after China released its first detailed position paper on the UN reforms. It called for a broad consensus on the reforms through consultations among the UN member nations. The paper makes it clear that China views the enlargement of the Security Council only as part of a larger reforms package. It also reflects the Chinese position that regional groups discuss the reforms proposals relating to their respective areas before agreeing to them. 

 Wu was, however, emphatic that Chinas view of the G4 draft resolution should not be seen as affecting bilateral relations between India and China. Our relations at present are the best in decades. 

 Without specifying the areas, he said China was willing to open more border routes to India if the latter so wanted.

 He added that China had no difficulty in considering any proposal to open such routes between Ladakh and western China. But we have not discussed any such proposal yet.

 The two countries have also taken positive steps with regard to the boundary disputes as well as on the clarification on the Line of Actual Control. There was a link between the two but these are also different things, Wu said. 

 I hope the clarification will help resolve the boundary question, instead of acting the other way around. 

 But China wanted both sides to keep the boundary question away from affecting the overall bilateral relations. The boundary issue should not be overemphasised at the cost of peace and co-operation, the vice-minister added. 

 On Nepal, though, Wu sounded a veiled note of caution about Indias policy regarding that country. The affairs of Nepal should be left to its people and government. There should be no international inference in the affairs of Nepal, he said. 

 The international community should respect the sovereignty of Nepal.

 The vice-minister also hit out at US defence secretary Donald Rumsfelds charge that Chinas military spending could threaten the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region. 

 Chinas economic development has no imperialist or expansionist ambitions. Well not try to dictate in international affairs even if we grow stronger. 

 China would not practise unilateralism in international affairs, as practised by some other countries, Wu said.

 Govt stamp on Pathak panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: The Centre today formally notified the setting up of the Justice R.S. Pathak inquiry authority under Section 11 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, and vested it with certain powers under this act to go into the allegations of payoffs to former external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh and the Congress Party which have been named in the Volcker committee report on the UN oil-for-food programme.

 The power conferred on the authority provides for tabling of its report with the memorandum of action taken in Parliament within six months of submitting it to the government. The authority will also have the powers of a civil court to summon witnesses and documents, receive evidence, call on any person to furnish information useful or relevant to the inquiry and search or seize books of accounts and other relevant documents.

 It will be empowered to use the services of any official or investigative agency of the central or state governments with their concurrence to conduct its own investigations. The proceedings of the authority will be deemed to be a judicial proceeding and under sections 6 and 9 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, no statement a person makes before the authority can be used against him in any civil or criminal case and acts in good faith will be protected from legal proceedings.

 A government resolution stated that the authority will:

 Inquire into the question of whether any Indian entity or individual received money or other considerations from or paid money/other considerations to any government, agency, company, firm or individual connected with the oil-for-food programme specifically relating to contract numbers M/9/54 and M/10/57. Both involve Masefield AG, Switzerland.

 Probe the sources of information, materials and documents available with the Volcker committee on these two contracts and give its opinion on the authenticity and reliability on the sources, materials and documents cited and whether the purported transaction was genuine or not.

 Give its opinion on whether the references to the Indian entities and individuals pertaining to contracts M/9/54 and M/10/57 (the names of Andaleeb Sehgal and Hamadan Exports were specifically mentioned in the resolution) were justified or not.

 The resolution stated the authority will have the powers to regulate its procedures, including determining the place and time of its sittings and whether they should be public or private. It will be headquartered in Delhi. It was tasked to complete its findings and submit its report to the government within six months, unless its tenure was extended.

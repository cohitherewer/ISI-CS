 Footage bar

 New Delhi, Oct. 28 (PTI): Delhi High Court today restrained five TV news networks from using Prasar Bharatis exclusive footage of the ongoing India-Sri Lanka cricket series for producing their own cricket programmes.

 Justice Swatanter Kumar passed the ex-parte interim order on a suit filed by Prasar Bharati which alleged that the five private channels were using its exclusive footage of the series in violation of the terms and conditions prescribed for such use.

 The networks affected by the order are Sahara, Asianet Communications, Eanadu TV, India TV and TV 9.

 Appearing for Prasar Bharati, senior counsel A.S. Chandioke submitted that according to the terms and conditions, private TV channels could use the footage only in regular news bulletins and that, too, not exceeding 30 seconds per bulletin with a total of two minutes in a day.

 He also argued that the news channels could not carry advertisements or messages before, during and after showing such footage.

 Chandioke informed the court that the cricket board had awarded exclusive telecast/broadcast rights for the India-Sri Lanka and India-South Africa series to Prasar Bharati on October 24, and since the contract was still being vetted by the BCCI lawyers, the parties had agreed that they would be governed by the terms and conditions agreed upon by them in April this year for the India-Pakistan cricket series.

 Under this agreement, private channels cannot use Prasar Bharati footage to produce their own programmes.

 Reel-smoke ban truce bid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 6: Information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy and health minister Anbumani Ramadoss will meet later this month to stub out problems triggered by the decision to ban Bollywood actors from smoking on screen.

 On May 31, Ramadoss had announced amendments to the Tobacco Control Act, introducing a series of measures, including a prohibition against smoking on screen. He left for the US the next day, leaving the information and broadcasting ministry to deal with the howls of protest that emanated from the film industry, which felt the move tampered with artistic freedom. 

 Reddys ministry will have to ensure that the rules are followed by the film and television industries.

 Ramadoss had written to the information and broadcasting ministry asking for their views on the decision. But he was so keen on announcing the ban on May 31, to coincide with World No Tobacco Day, that he did not wait for the ministrys officials to get back to him.

 Now that the tough new regulations have been announced, Reddys ministry does not want to make a public issue of it and is likely to go ahead with what some believe is a path-breaking and progressive law.

 Reddy has said he welcomes the move in principle but has made it clear that there could be problems of enforcement. After Ramadoss returns on Sunday, Reddy will meet him to talk through the changes suggested by the health ministry.

 An exception will have to be made for films where smoking is integral to the plot and the information and broadcasting ministry will try to make sure the ban is not rigid and there is room for artistic freedom.

 Ramadosss unilateral decision to ban smoking on screen has several people huffing and puffing. No self-respecting director will like it, censor board chief Sharmila Tagore had said last week. 

 Either the film industry or the censor board should have been consulted on the matter, she said, adding that she has written to the information and broadcasting ministry and expressed her views.

 The censor board chief said the ban would be extremely difficult to enforce. Although I support the intent, it is very difficult to implement, especially when we have foreign movies coming into the country. 

 She said the government should give the industry more time to consider the matter.

 Applying it from August is very difficult, especially for films which have been completed or are on the verge of completion.

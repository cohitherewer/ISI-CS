 Srinagar/New Delhi, July 25: As smoke continued to billow from the hastily stubbed-out marriage feast fire, the Valley today smouldered with hundreds of schoolchildren taking to the streets in protest against the killing of innocents.

 On Saturday night, Rashtriya Rifles jawans waiting to ambush militants had mistakenly shot dead three boys, aged between 11 and 16, headed for a marriage reception in Bangergund village of north Kashmirs Kupwara district.

 Groups of angry students pelted stones at passing army vehicles and shouted slogans outside army camps in Kupwara, continuing the wave of protests for the second day running. A vehicle near Trehgam village was badly damaged, forcing soldiers to fire in the air.

 Police fired tear gas shells and used batons to disperse agitating crowds. Three persons were injured in the clashes and were admitted to hospital, a police officer said.

 Hurriyat Conference activists, too, lent their voices, screaming stop the killing and genocide of innocent Kashmiris, before 20 of them were herded off to a police station in Srinagar. The police said they had defied a ban on unauthorised public meetings.

 The army today apologised for the death of the boys ? Wasim Sultan Wani, 12, Bilal Khaliq Shah, 11, and Shabir Ahmed Shah, 16 ? terming the killings a regrettable incident. But it said the boys did not stop when challenged.

 The army requests all persons to stop when challenged and not run away as it leads to suspicion, an army statement said.

 Generally there is no civilian movement in the villages in the interior areas at night, hence they were mistaken as militants, challenged and fired at by the troops in the ambush as they tried to run away from the site. 

 The army said it regrets this unfortunate loss of life and had ordered an inquiry. Instructions had also been issued to prevent recurrence of such incidents, it said.

 It also appealed to villagers in insurgency-prone areas not to venture out at night.

 People residing in terrorism-affected areas are also being advised not to move out at night. However, in case of an emergency, they are advised to move with lights, the army said.

 Kupwara district borders the Line of Control and is a zone of much violence. But the army that has been regularly patrolling the countryside at night for over a decade was expected to have evolved mechanisms to prevent such horrible accidents, an officer said.

 Army chief General J.J. Singh is understood to have sought details of the incident. 

 The National Human Rights Commission has asked the government to submit a report in two weeks. It has asked the Centre to ensure there is no conflict between respect for human rights and combating terrorism.

 It was important not to undermine democratic values, violate human rights, subvert the rule of law or chill civil liberties of citizens, while countering terror, it said.

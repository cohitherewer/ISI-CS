 July 27: Air-Indias flights out of the country have been caught up in Mumbais swirling floods.

 Most international flights out of the city were cancelled while a few, including flights to Paris, Frankfurt, Chicago and Newark, have been diverted to take off from Delhi.

 We are flying in passengers from Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, who had booked a passage out of Mumbai, to Delhi to catch these flights, said Air-India regional director (north) D.S. Kohli.

 Kohli admitted that the flights out had drastically few passengers, though flights returning home were chock-a-block. But thats natural, he said, as most passengers were booked from Mumbai.

 Travel agents said other international airlines that operate flights to Mumbai were diverting them to nearby airports and were similarly plagued for want of passengers because of the massive dislocation. 

 Debasish Chatterjee of Citi Travels said: Every airline, be it British, Dutch or South African, has been affected.... Its tough luck but this is what happens when something of this magnitude happens.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patels office, however, confirmed that Mumbai airport could be opened around noon tomorrow as the water on the runways was receding.

 Till then, it is the airport in Goa that has to bear the brunt of the Mumbai downpour. Since last night, six flights ? all of them domestic ? have been diverted to Dabolim airport, an airport source said. 

 But, since this morning, there has been no movement as there is no runway space available as of this moment.

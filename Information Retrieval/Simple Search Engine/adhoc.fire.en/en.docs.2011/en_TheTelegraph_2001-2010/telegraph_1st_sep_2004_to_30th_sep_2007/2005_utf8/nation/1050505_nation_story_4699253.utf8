 Peace wishlist from Pakistan

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, May 3: The peace process might be ?irreversible? but Pakistan expects India to take serious steps to restore the confidence of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

 Reducing troops deployed in the state, addressing charges of human rights violation and announcing a general amnesty on political prisoners are some of the steps Islamabad is looking for. Permission to Hurriyat leaders to travel to Pakistan is another.

 The mood on both sides is positive after the ?extremely successful? meeting between Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf in New Delhi last month. But the first test of the ?positive atmosphere? will come this month-end when officials of the two countries meet in Islamabad between May 26 to 28 to discuss Sir Creek and Siachen.

 The Prime Minister said recently that if the peace process with Pakistan is allowed to continue for some time, a conducive atmosphere could be created for the final settlement of the Kashmir issue. 

 Both Islamabad and Delhi agree that the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service launched last month has had a ?tremendous impact? on the Kashmiris. But Pakistan wants more.

 India is apprehensive about reducing troops in Jammu and Kashmir since it does not believe Pakistan has done away with the terror apparatus. South Block officials argue that the Musharraf regime might have turned off the ?terror tap? now, but it has kept the infrastructure intact. This will allow it to turn on the ?terror tap? any time, they feel. 

 Islamabad denies this and claims that the terrorist infrastructure ?exists only in the minds? of the officials in Delhi and not on the ground. 

 As both sides take tentative steps forward in the normalisation process, there is general agreement that despite the positive vibes, the task is not easy and that many ?complex? and ?difficult? issues need to be addressed and resolved.

 Pakistan has asked Delhi not to jump to conclusions if and when there are terrorist attacks in Kashmir or elsewhere in the country, sources said. There are forces in both countries that might try to derail the peace process, it has pointed out, adding that these forces were behind the attempts on Musharraf?s life. 

 Islamabad feels that if there are any terrorist strikes, instead of indulging in mutual accusations, both countries should come together to condemn the attacks and express their resolve to combat the menace.

 Pakistan has also tried to address concerns expressed by some sections in India that Musharraf?s might be a lone voice for peace, sources said. Clear indications have been given from Islamabad that there is ?an-across-the-board? agreement among all parties to have peace with India. 

 Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, Chaudhury Shujaat Hussain, the leader of the Pakistani Muslim League, and even hardliner Maulana Fazlur Rahman have made public statements to express their support for building strong ties with India, the sources added.

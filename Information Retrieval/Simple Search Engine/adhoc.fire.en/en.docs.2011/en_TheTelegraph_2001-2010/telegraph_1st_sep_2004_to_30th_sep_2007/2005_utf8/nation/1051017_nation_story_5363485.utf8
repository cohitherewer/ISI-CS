 Bhopal, Oct. 16: Uma Bharti today laid a siege around Babulal Gaur, getting some 100 party MLAs ? including six ministers ? to publicly support her claim to replace him as Madhya Pradesh chief minister.

 It was not clear, however, if Uma would get back the chair even if Gaur goes, because her relations with some BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leaders have been uneasy.

 Sources close to the former chief minister claimed she has the support of BJP chief L.K. Advani, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Jaswant Singh. 

 But they admitted that the line-up of her critics, too, is long. Among them are M. Venkaiah Naidu, Sanjay Joshi, Suresh Soni, Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj.

 Uma today held an impressive show of strength here, with party MLAs queuing up to demand her return as chief minister. Over 80 MLAs signed a letter addressed to Advani, demanding a change of guard in Bhopal. Another 18 sent a fax pledging support for Uma.

 State BJP sources said the tally was sure to touch around 125 by Monday afternoon. The BJP has 173 members in the 230-strong state Assembly.

 Gaur was showcasing his governments achievements at the state BJP executive in Jabalpur when the news of Umas coup reached him. It sent the chief minister scurrying for the phone, calling up everyone who matters in the BJP and the Sangh.

 But by late evening, it had become clear that only three parivar leaders ? Venkaiah Naidu, Sanjay Joshi and Suresh Soni ? were sympathetic to the idea of his continuation.

 Gaur got feeble support from state BJP chief Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who said the chief minister enjoyed the partys support. But as Chauhan is himself a contender for the post, his statement is being seen more as a bid to stall Uma.

 Yesterday, Uma had suffered a blow of sorts when the Sangh publicly rejected her claim that the contents of her letter to its chief, K.S. Sudarshan, were different from those of the letter leaked to media. Uma had written to Sudarshan criticising some Sangh and BJP functionaries. 

 Today, she sought to make up with the sarsanghchalak, who was in Bhopal for a book release.

 Uma also said she was unwell and would not campaign in poll-bound Bihar. The message seems clear: unless the party gives her the job she thinks she deserves, it can forget about her support in Bihar.

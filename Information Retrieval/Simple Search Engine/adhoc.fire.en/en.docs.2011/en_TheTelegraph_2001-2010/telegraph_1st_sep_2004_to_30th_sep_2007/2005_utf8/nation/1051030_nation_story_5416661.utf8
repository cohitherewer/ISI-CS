 Dhaka blast clean chit to Delhi

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: India and Bangladesh ended two days of home secretary-level talks this morning but not before Delhi got a clean chit on its alleged involvement in the 400-odd bomb blasts that rocked the neighbour last August.

 Home secretary Sarfaraz Hossain said media reports about Indias involvement do not reflect the official position of the Government of Bangladesh.

 During recent talks between the chiefs of the two border forces ? Bangladesh Rifles and the Border Security Force ? BDR chief Lieutenant General J.A. Choudhury had said they had proof that India was responsible for the August 17 blasts.

 The neighbours today came out with a joint statement, which was finalised at 2.30 am after several hitches, agreeing to provide consular access to each others arrested nationals on a reciprocal basis. 

 Indian officials said consular access would help Delhi find out details about terrorists operating in the Northeast out of Bangladesh.

 The two sides also decided to sign an agreement to combat smuggling of drugs and narcotics. Dhaka, however, did not agree to Delhis request for a high-level meeting to discuss and set up a mechanism to deal with illegal migration from Bangladesh. Following Indias insistence on an extradition treaty, Bangladesh agreed to expedite its response to the proposal.

 Sources said the talks were about to go into a deadlock when Hossain refused to include some vital points in the minutes of the meeting. These included access to Delhi to verify if there were any anti-India militant camps in Bangladesh.

 Musician in freak stage death

 Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): A percussionist 

 was electrocuted on Thursday while readying the stage where 

 his wife was to perform a musical play as part of a film 

 shoot.

 Koodiyattam is the classical Sanskrit drama recognised as a cultural heritage by the Unesco.

 Potti died on way to hospital.

 Potti and Sathi have been associated with the Margi classical cultural forum here.

 Amarinder Dubai secret out

 Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal chief 

 Parkash Singh Badal has asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 

 and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to come clean on the 

 mystery and motive behind Punjab 

 chief minister Amarinder Singhs hush-hush 

 visit to Dubai, reports our special correspondent.

 According to newspaper reports, Amarinder, accompanied by his media adviser B.I.S. Chahal and superintendent of police (security) Khubi Ram, had left for Dubai on June 18 to attend the wedding of Delhi Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee president Paramjit Singh Sarnas brother-in-law. The bill was allegedly footed by Sarna.

 However, the Centre, the police, state Congress leaders and even Amarinders aides were in the dark about the trip, as were authorities in Dubai.

 In addition to being a huge internal security embarrassment to the country, Amarinders latest act has suspect motives written all over it. This can no longer be shrugged off, Badal said in a statement.

 It happened without our knowledge. The chief minister simply vanished and we were told he was resting in Patiala, a police officer said. We would have been hauled up had something untoward occurred.

 Man builds own tomb

 SankaranKovil (Tamil Nadu): A 75-year-old 

 man here has built his own tomb because he does not want 

 to leave the work to anyone else.

 A stone tablet on the tomb predicts that he will die in 2007. The date and month are not given. When our father died, we built his tomb with great difficulty as we were in debt, said K.S. Madasamy. 

 Blast kills boy

 when it went off, killing him on the spot.

 Time Bomb

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court 

 has issued notices to producer-director Ketan Mehta, his 

 wife Deepa Sahi and their company Maya Movies on a plea

 Zee Telefilms of copying the storyline, presentation technology 

 and the script of its teleserial 24. 

 Chenab alert

 in the Jammu region on Friday following a rise in the level 

 of the Chenab. Authorities have readied a contingency plan

 Maoist shot

 have dealt a blow to the peace initiatives with Maoists 

 by killing a senior leader of the Janashakti group, Riaz

 fire with police at a village near here.

 Bluestar demand

 Chandigarh (PTI): Khalistan ideologue 

 Jagjit Singh Chohan on Friday demanded the return of Sikh 

 literature allegedly seized by the Indian Army from the 

 Golden Temple during Operation Bluestar in 1984. He sought 

 appropriate action from President A.P.J. Abdul 

 Kalam.

 The Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Cultural Cooperation in Trinidad and Tobago recently held a workshop to promote Hindi as part of the 160th Indian Day Arrival celebrations.

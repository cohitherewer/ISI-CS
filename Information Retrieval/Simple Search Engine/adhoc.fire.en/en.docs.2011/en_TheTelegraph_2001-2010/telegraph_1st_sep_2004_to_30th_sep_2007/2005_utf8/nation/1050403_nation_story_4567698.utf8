 Jammu, April 2: Kashmiri leaders today slammed Pakistan?s denial of permission to an all-party delegation from the state to board the inaugural Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus even as Islamabad claimed the decision was taken to give priority to ?divided families?.

 The Jammu and Kashmir Assembly said Pakistan?s announcement yesterday smacked of its government?s ?compulsions? rather than the ?willingness for such contacts?. 

 Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed called the denial ?very unfortunate? but asked the Opposition not to undermine the overall goodwill impact of the bus service which, he said, is essentially for the reunion of divided families in the two Kashmirs.

 Earlier, National Conference leader Ali Mohammad Sagar described Pakistan?s move as a ?shattering slap on the face of India, the House and its members? and wanted to know why the state government had publicised the names if it was not sure of the response.

 Mufti conceded the denial was a ?setback? but said it should not be misconstrued as a blow to the process for which the bus service has been resumed after a gap of nearly six decades. 

 ?It is immaterial whether one party leader or the other goes across the LoC or not, but we should not lose sight of the fact that divided families would travel in the bus,? he said.

 In Islamabad, the foreign office said the decision to deny permission to the 10-member delegation of leaders from the Congress, National Conference, People?s Democratic Party and the CPM was taken to ?avoid controversy?.

 ?The bus service is basically run as a humanitarian measure to reduce the suffering of the divided families and to enable them to meet their loved ones. It should be confined to those people.? Pakistan accorded priority to them,? spokesperson Jalil Abbas Jilani said.

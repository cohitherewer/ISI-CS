 Truck crash sparks blast scare at Ayodhya 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept 7: When the truck crashed into the Ayodhya complex main gate, the waiting pilgrims and guards took cover, thinking it was a car bomb.

 Only when, instead of an ear-splitting bang, they heard the groans of the injured constables did they realise the truth ? it was a police truck that had lost control.

 Two months after the July 5 militant raid, the main gate of Ayodhyas makeshift Ram temple again witnessed scenes of panic and confusion this morning.

 Later, in an unrelated event, the police picked up three madarsa students moving suspiciously in the area, armed with a camera, provocative literature and pictures of several temples, including the Ayodhya Ram temple.

 The truck, carrying Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) personnel, had arrived around 7.30 am, too early for the 9.30 am change of shift. The PAC forms the outer security ring at the disputed site.

 My first thought was, Oh God, it must be packed with explosives, a police officer said.

 The truck was ferrying jawans from the PAC camp at Faizabad station, 1.5 km away. The driver lost control just near the complex, hit a house and then rammed into the main gate of the temple, said Aloke Sinha, principal secretary, state home department.

 The accident badly damaged the gate, which leads to the sanctum sanctorum, and injured 11 jawans, one seriously. He is, however, responding to treatment, an officer in Faizabad said.

 The crash prompted the temple management to call off the early morning Ram Lalla darshan. At least 150 pilgrims, mostly from the southern part of the country, had been waiting for the viewing.

 State government sources said the Faizabad district authorities were immediately instructed to repair the gate but engineers said the job would take at least six hours.

 As for the three persons arrested later, the principal secretary, home, said they are from Kerala and studied at a madarsa in Moradabad.

 The police frisked them and found some discrepancies in their papers. They carried literature with provocative slogans.

 We are examining their antecedents. Interrogation is on, the principal secretary said.

 Its not been a good time for Ayodhya. We are planning a special puja soon, said Sant Balaram, a priest and member of a local temple trust.

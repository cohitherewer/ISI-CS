 Wonder pills here

 Mumbai, Dec. 20: Wonder pill Viagra has finally arrived in India, reports our special correspondent.

 Available in the grey market till now under various brand names that tried to rhyme with it, Viagra ? the cure for erectile dysfunction ? was officially launched in India today by pharma major Pfizer.

 In a market flooded with at least seven local brands of sildenafil citrate tablets selling at much cheaper prices, it is difficult to say how much impact Pfizers Viagra could have. It is priced at Rs 595 for a 100-mg pill and Rs 463 for a 50-mg pill.

 Pfizer India Ltds managing director Kewal Handa, however, seemed confident that Viagra would make its presence felt since customers have been waiting for the original product. They want to be certain that they are buying the original product, Handa said at the launch at a city hotel today. 

 Viagra arrives in India seven years after its launch in the US. According to a Pfizer release, Viagra has been introduced in 123 countries across the world and has sold 1.87 billion pills so far.

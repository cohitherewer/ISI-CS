 Karat to take off with pension bill

 Prakash Karat: Money talk

 New Delhi, April 17: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, seen as a hardliner on economic issues, will begin his tenure with a volatile subject ? the pension bill. 

 Karat will meet Left Front allies on Thursday, two days after the budget session of Parliament session resumes after recess. 

 The meeting will discuss the pension regulatory authority bill that was part of the budget proposals introduced by the finance minister. The bill seeks to change the social security system from a benefit-oriented process to a contributory one. It proposes a 10 per cent contribution by employees, unlike the present pension scheme where workers do not have to make any contribution.

 The bill also seeks to link a part of returns to market forces. It suggests opening the doors for private players to the pension sector and allowing them to invest a part of the funds in the stock market.

 The Left, which is against both proposals, threatened to vote against the bill and the government was forced to refer it to a standing committee. Defeat of the bill would have led to the fall of the government because it is a money bill. 

 The CPM will have to take a stand after the standing committee returns the bill to Parliament.

 Karat has said the party will prevent the government from passing the bill that they think will hurt the poor and the country?s ?national sovereignty?. 

 On Thursday, the general secretary visited Ajay Bhawan, the CPI headquarters, and met his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan and his junior D. Raja. ?It was a courtesy call. We will have a coordination committee meeting of the Left parties next Thursday,? Raja said.

 The meeting will also focus on how to increase Left intervention in national politics both inside and outside Parliament. In his speech to delegates at the 18th party congress, at which he took over, Karat said this is the right time for the CPM to increase its influence.

 Call-centre cheats leave families in shock

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR 

 Pune, April 15: Call-centre cheat Ivan Thomas and eight colleagues were today remanded in police custody till Monday after Pune cyber cops told court the trail of some others in the fraud needed to be followed up.

 Thomas and his colleagues, all employees of the BPO MsourceE, siphoned $425,000 (Rs 1.83 crore) off the accounts of Citibank?s New York customers and deposited the money in various bank accounts in Pune between December 2004 and March this year.

 Cyber crime cell ACP Sanjay Jadhav told the court Thomas, his colleague Stephen Daniel and a travel agent John Verghese had travelled to Bangkok from March 22-24 and used the same method to withdraw more money.

 Some unknown others too had attempted the method five times on these two days, he said. To find out if more money had been withdrawn, he required the custody of the accused for some more time, Jadhav said. 

 The officer said Citibank?s Net banking procedures involved telephone verification on an international toll free number. As the accused had made overseas calls from phone booths to make the illegal transfers, a thorough probe was needed to crack the modus operandi, he said.

 Jadhav said Verghese had provided the BPO employees altered visa and passport documents. He submitted to the court a confidential three-page document from Citibank giving details of the wire transfers.

 Those produced before the court today included prime accused Thomas, Daniel, Siddarth Mehta, Marylene Fernandes, Shailesh Bhurewar, Soundraj Ramanujan, Bijay Alexander, Narayan Yadav and Priji Philoses.

 Dressed in a colourful T-shirt and denims, bespectacled five-footer Thomas looked calm. Marylene had her face covered with a blue dupatta. ?No complaints,? chorused the group when magistrate A. Shaikh of the civil and sessions court in Shivaji Nagar asked if they had anything to say against the police. 

 Most of the accused are educated and belong to middle-class families. ?Thomas has an MBA degree and was believed to be drawing a salary of Rs 70,000 per month as an administrative officer in a company before he joined MsourcE,? said Yogesh Pawar, who along with Pune lawyer Harshad Nimbalkar, appeared for Thomas.

 Twenty-year-old Siddarth Mehta?s mother is a teacher and his father a businessman based in Mumbai. Bijay Alexander, a mechanical engineer, was employed as HR assistant in MsourcE.

 As the group was led away by the police, Bijay?s mother Lily broke down. ?My boy hasn?t done anything. His only crime is that his telephone number was found on Thomas?s phone,? she said.

 Bijay?s family and friends are shocked by the charges against him. ?I have known Bijay closely for several years. He cannot do this. I can vouch for his innocence,? pastor Alvin Ramteke of Akurdi church, who accompanied Bijay?s mother, said.

 Police have, however, recovered Rs 3 lakh from Bijay?s possession. This was part of the Rs 19.56 lakh worth of cash and articles recovered from the group. The articles included a Rs 7,000 wrist watch, a gold chain worth Rs 18,000 purchased by Thomas, a Rs 1.5 lakh Zen acquired by Daniel and a cellphone bought by Siddarth Mehta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Secular avatar hits home with allies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nitish and (top) 

 Naidu: Friends in need 

 New Delhi, June 9: If the motive behind L.K. Advanis statements in Pakistan was to become more acceptable to a future ruling coalition, he may not have been wide off the mark.

 Such comments are worthy of Advani. There is nothing wrong in his comments on Jinnah or confiding that Babri was a mistake, said N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose Telugu Desam Party had given outside support to the former Vajpayee government. 

 Asked whether he had any discussions with Advani after his return from Pakistan, Naidu said he hadnt. But all I wish to say is that whatever Advani has said gives his personality a new status. It is another feather in his cap.

 Officially, however, the Desam maintains that Advanis resignation is an internal matter of the BJP.

 Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar today met Advani and assured him his partys support. In the evening, party leaders held a meeting at the residence of George Fernandes and formally decided that the Dal(U) would back Advani.

 The Trinamul Congress, too, has backed the former deputy Prime Minister.

 The allies support is crucial for Advani if he remains in active politics and wants to widen his reach among non-Hindutva parties.

 For the partners, retaining and widening their vote bank among the Muslims is an electoral compulsion. The Janata Dal (United) has a lot at stake in Bihar, the Desam in Andhra Pradesh and the Trinamul in Bengal.

 All three parties are clear that they do not want to be part of the alliance if the BJP reverts to strident Hindutva. That seems a possibility now that Sangh parivar hardliners, having virtually forced Advani out of the partys top job, have increased their clout in the BJP.

 The Dal (U)s immediate electoral compulsions ? the Assembly polls in Bihar ? have made the party wary of being seen as part of a communal, anti-Muslim coalition. The party hopes to do better than last time.

 Nor does the Trinamuls Mamata Banerjee, whose fortunes in Bengal are on a downswing, want to do anything that might project her party as unfriendly to Muslims. 

 The Desam, since its rout in the last Assembly and parliamentary polls, has been thinking about quitting the BJP-led alliance. At the partys last national executive meeting, leaders blamed the BJP for the Desams failure in the elections.

 Naidu last month reopened a channel of communication with the CPM and CPI general secretaries after almost a five-year gap. Naidu told Left leaders that he wants to quit the BJP-led alliance but is not ready to be an ally of the Congress. In Hyderabad today, he emphasised that his party is no more bound to the BJP in any manner.

 As of now, there is no relationship between the Telugu Desam and the BJP. We had seat-sharing arrangements during last elections and also gave outside support to the NDA government. That is all, he said.

 When asked whether he didnt have close personal bonds with top BJP leaders, Naidu replied: I have very friendly relations with (Nationalist Congress Party leader) Sharad Pawar, (Samajwadi Party chief) Mulayam Singh Yadav, (DMK leader) Karunanidhi and (CPM patriarch) Jyoti Basu, too.

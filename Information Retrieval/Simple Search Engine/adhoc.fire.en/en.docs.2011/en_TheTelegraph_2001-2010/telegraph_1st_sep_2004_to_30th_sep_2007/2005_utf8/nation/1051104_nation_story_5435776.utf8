 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, Nov. 3: A junior naval officer has been charged with murdering his wife. Cuffe Parade police said Sampat Rai, 31, was arrested for attempt to murder after he beat up his wife Vandana on October 25 at their south Mumbai house.

 Rais drunken assault on Vandana was on the suspicion that she was having an extra-marital affair. A bruised Vandana was admitted to a naval hospital where she succumbed to her injuries last night.

 Following her death, the police upgraded the charge to to murder and produced Rai before a local metropolitan court today. The court remanded him in police custody till November 7.

 Senior inspector J. Naik said: The couple married 10 years ago. But their relationship was strained due to Rais suspicions. The differences had led to separation but they were reunited by their relatives and were staying together for the past few months.

 The murder revived memories of the 1959 Nanavati murder case. Navy commander Kawas Nanavati had shot a businessman after he learnt that he had an affair with his British wife. The case led to a landmark court battle which contributed to the abolition of jury trials in India.

 Gaur to junk two-child rule

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Gaur 

 Bhopal, July 24: Wiser after a meeting of the National Population Commission yesterday, Babulal Gaur has pledged to scrap the two-child norm under which panchayat members in Madhya Pradesh can be disqualified for having more than two children. 

 The Madhya Pradesh chief minister has admitted that the biggest losers in the two-child norm in panchayats are women and the poor people.

 However, some 839 sarpanchs, mostly women, have already been disqualified for not adhering to the law, brought into force in 2001 by the previous Congress government under Digvijay Singh. 

 Village women seldom have any say on how many children they will have and the poor have little access to reproductive healthcare, the chief minister said, adding that the law should either be enforced at all levels or be scrapped. 

 Gaur made a firm commitment to repeal the law at the population meet in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh set the tone yesterday when he said coercion of any kind to achieve population stability is unacceptable in a free society.

 After introducing the two-child norm, Digvijay remained a mute spectator when the elected representatives tried every trick in the book to save their chairs. 

 In one case, a woman sarpanch and her husband, also a panchayat member, gave up their third child (a daughter) for adoption. 

 In another instance, a man denied he was the father when his wife bore a third child, leading to a DNA test being proposed to prove the paternity of the infant. 

 One sarpanch blamed faulty condoms and even moved the local court but his plea was dismissed. 

 NGOs working for womens empowerment and reproductive health rights believe that the law was actually punishing women and the marginalised sections of society. They welcomed Gaurs announcement. 

 Rehana Sultan, who runs the NGO Aurat, said the chief ministers observations were realistic and based on a shift from the target-oriented approach to family planning to one of advocacy, quality of care and individual choice.

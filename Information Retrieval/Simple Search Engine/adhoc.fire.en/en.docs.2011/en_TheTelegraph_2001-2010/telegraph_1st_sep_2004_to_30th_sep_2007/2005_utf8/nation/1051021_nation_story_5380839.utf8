 Comedy of a death foretold 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Betul (Madhya Pradesh), Oct. 20: Kunjilal Malviya has just missed being a martyr to the cause of superstition.

 The 75-year-old astrologer from Sehara village ? having predicted his own death between 3 pm and 4 pm today ? had sat down in meditation before TV cameras in the afternoon, waiting for that moment of glory when the forecast would come true.

 He would not see it, of course, but his limp body would proclaim to the world the triumph of astrology over reason and science.

 The cameras waited with breathless anticipation; so did a huge crowd of the curious, sceptical and the worshipful ? breathlessly.

 Only, however much he tried, Malviyas body just would not get breathless the way it was supposed to.

 As 4 pm approached, the aged man took off his shirt, winced and kept coughing very hard as the chanting of hymns around him rose to a crescendo.

 But the hour came and went and finally Malviya, before millions of eyes glued to the small screen, had to get up. Living proof that astrology has no substance?

 Yes, crowed the assembled activists of the Indian Rationalist Societys Bhopal chapter. After all, when a scientific claim is put to the test, the criteria of success and failure are clearly set beforehand. If the experiment fails, the claim is abandoned.

 The rationalists, therefore, had stuck their neck out by being present: had the man coincidentally died between 3 and 4, they would have had egg on their face, acknowledged Society member Sanal Eumando.

 An astrologer, however, has no compulsion to follow the norms of science. An unfazed Malviya just shifted the goalposts.

 Today is Karva Chauth, he pointed out, when Hindu wives across the country fast and pray for their husbands longevity. Its the power of his wife Bhagyawatis prayers that has defeated even death, he said.

 Yes, God has responded to my fast and prayers; I didnt want his prediction to come true, Bhagyawati said.

 As reality show turned soap opera, Malviya himself laughed at his own prediction, admitting: Only God knows the truth about (a persons) death.

 Malviya and his family, even as they played their joke on the nations TV watchers, had already gained a lot. 

 Apart from huge publicity in this backward belt of southern Madhya Pradesh, some 200 km from Bhopal, they had been showered with offerings of money and other gifts today.

 Betul has a literacy level of less than 20 per cent. Another village, Malajpur, 45 km from Sehara, hosts an annual bhoot pret ka mela (ghost fair), where those said to be possessed are cured.

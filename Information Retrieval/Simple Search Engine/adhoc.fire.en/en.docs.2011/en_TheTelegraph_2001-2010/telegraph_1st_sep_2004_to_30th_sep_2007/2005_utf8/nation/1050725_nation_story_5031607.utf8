 Air shield in war against Maoists

 New Delhi, July 24: Security forces combating insurgents and Naxalites will soon be able to call for air cover.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil said the government was also considering providing mobile phones ? in addition to other modern weapons and communications systems ? to personnel engaged in fighting militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, security forces in the Northeast and the Naxalite-infested areas.

 Air cover will be available to paramilitary and state police forces for evacuating injured personnel and, if necessary, for operational purposes, he said.

 The decision comes on the heels of the June 18 meeting of the co-ordination committee of Naxalite-affected states, which had decided to set up two joint task forces to deal with rebels. 

 The idea of providing air cover to boost counter-insurgency operations was also mooted at the meeting held in Hyderabad.

 Militants are known to set up camps in remote areas where communication links hardly exist. 

 In the Northeast, some organisations have bases in border areas, including inaccessible hilly terrain.

 This (use of air power) is a change in the thinking and strategy, Patil said when asked about steps being taken to modernise the police forces.

 As part of the modernisation drive, the Centre is making available better weapons to match the firepower of militants, besides providing armoured vehicles and advanced communication equipment to security forces.

 The Border Security Force at present has six to seven helicopters that could be used by the Central Reserve Police Force, India Reserve Battalions, the Shasastra Seema Bal and other paramilitary forces and state police forces during operations, the home minister said.

 The police forces can also seek helicopters from the armed forces if required, he said. 

 Such forces were also being given modern protective gear like bullet-proof jackets and advanced training to help them face greater challenges, Patil added.

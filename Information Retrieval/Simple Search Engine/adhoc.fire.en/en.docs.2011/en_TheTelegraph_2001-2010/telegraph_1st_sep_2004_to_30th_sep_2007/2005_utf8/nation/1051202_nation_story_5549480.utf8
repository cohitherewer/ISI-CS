 Ranbaxy ready to make US flu drug

 New York, Dec. 1 (Reuters): Indian generic drug company Ranbaxy Laboratories today said it was prepared to produce large quantities of Tamiflu for the US to help meet the threat of avian flu and was in talks with the drugs maker, Roche Holding AG.

 Ranbaxy said within a year it could provide enough oseltamivir phosphate ? the active ingredient in Tamiflu ? to produce 1.3 billion 75 milligram capsules.

 Within six months of beginning production, Ranbaxy believes it can produce 300 million capsules.

 It is estimated that within the first six months approximately 20 million patients could receive a course of treatment, and within the first year in excess of 100 million patients could be managed for the avian flu, Ranbaxy chief executive Brian Tempest said.

 The active ingredient could be manufactured at Ranbaxys facilities in India, which have received the US Food and Drug Administrations approval. The drug maker said capsules could be produced at its US plants.

 Doctors and healthcare officials hope that Tamiflu may help reduce the symptoms of avian flu if it begins to easily infect people. But studies so far show that it will require high doses of the drug, which is also needed to help alleviate the seasonal flu.

 Swiss drugmaker Roche recently came under fire from critics who said it was reluctant to share its Tamiflu formula or grant permission to others to produce it to help satisfy mounting global demand for the drug. It has since eased its stance.

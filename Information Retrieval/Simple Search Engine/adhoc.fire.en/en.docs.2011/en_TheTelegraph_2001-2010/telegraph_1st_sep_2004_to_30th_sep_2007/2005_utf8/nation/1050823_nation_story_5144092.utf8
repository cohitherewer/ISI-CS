 Zee in cricket tender battle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Aug. 22: Last time round, the legal battle had started midway into the selection process. This time, it has begun even before the tender bids could be opened.

 Delhi High Court today issued notices to the Centre and the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) on a petition filed by Zee Telefilms, seeking quashing of the boards invitation to tender for telecast rights to cricket played in India in the next four years.

 A division bench of acting chief justice B. A. Khan and justice Madan B. Lokur asked the Centre and the BCCI to respond to the petition by August 24, the next date of hearing.

 Appearing for Zee, counsel Harish Salve alleged that the conditions in the document were tailor-made by BCCI to render Zee Telefilms and other private licensed Indian broadcasters ineligible.

 The way the tender has been drafted, it is very clear that the BCCI is trying to keep us out, Himangshu Mody, executive vice-president of Zee Sports, told The Telegraph. But we will not sit quiet.

 Mody also alleged that anticipating Zees suit ? it filed the petition on Saturday ? the BCCI issued an addendum to the tender document, also on Saturday.

 Our legal team is looking into the implications of the addendum, but our plea to the court is that all broadcasters be given a fair chance at bidding, Mody said.

 BCCI has also extended the deadline of submitting bids from August 23 to August 26.

 The cricket governing body asked only those entities with their own existing channel and first-hand experience of showing live international matches during the last three years to apply.

 Zee falls short as it launched its sports channel, Zee Sports, only a few months ago.

 After what happened with the last tender process, this was only expected from Zee. But legally, it doesnt seem to have much ground, a senior BCCI official said.

 Following a legal battle in May this year, the Supreme Court had dismissed Zees petition challenging a Madras High Court order that upheld BCCIs cancellation of the previous tender process for the period 2004 to 2008.

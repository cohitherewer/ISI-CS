 Hizb rebel kills Pak militant

 BINOO JOSHI

 Jammu, Jan. 9: A local rebel killed a Pakistani militant, upset over the foreigner?s misbehaviour with girls in Udhampur district.

 Abdul Karim yesterday shot dead Ghulam Nabi ? who headed the Gool unit of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen ? at Lancha in the district, notorious for the high presence of rebels.

 Karim then surrendered to the Border Security Force.

 The Pakistani militant had been harassing young girls of Gool, Karim told the BSF. He had also been ridiculing local rebels and was always pressuring them to involve boys of the area in militant activities, according to sources.

 The simmering resentment against Ghulam Nabi erupted yesterday when Karim opened fire, killing him on the spot.

 Earlier, too, there were reports of tension between local and Pakistani militants. However, this is the first time a local rebel has killed a foreign militant and sought refuge with the security forces.

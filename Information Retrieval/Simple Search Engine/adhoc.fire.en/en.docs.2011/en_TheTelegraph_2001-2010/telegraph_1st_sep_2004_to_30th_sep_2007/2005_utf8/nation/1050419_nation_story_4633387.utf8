The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Hope amp; despair in Pak

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, April 18: President Pervez Musharraf?s Delhi visit has generated a sense of optimism in Pakistan with many hoping for a possible breakthrough on Kashmir in not too distant a future.

 But former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Hameed Gul feared alienation of the Kashmiris and more bloodshed.

 Others disagreed. Diplomat Niaz A. Naik, who is also known for pursuing the back-channel diplomacy between Islamabad and New Delhi, said the visit was a success.

 It enabled the President and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to reach some common ground to move to a solution on Kashmir and other issues, he added.

 ?It is difficult at the moment to speculate the nature of the common ground but it is quite clear that the two countries and the entire region as a whole are on the verge of a breakthrough,? Naik told The Telegraph.

 He said the leadership of the two countries had developed a personal rapport, instead of relying on other mechanisms such as Track-II diplomacy, which in itself is a breakthrough.

 ?With Musharraf?s visit to India and the very meaningful and purposeful talks he held there, the future of Pakistan-India relations appears very promising,? Naik said, terming remarkable the turn of events in the Indian capital and the decisions announced in the joint statement.

 Another senior analyst of Pakistan-India affairs, General (retd.) Jamshed Ayaz, said though the outcome of the discussions is not yet fully known, the determination expressed by the two countries to carry forward the peace process is very encouraging.

 ?It will be wrong to assume that the discussions failed to yield any result,? Ayaz said, adding that it will take time to put matters in perspective.

 Ayaz drew attention to a sentence in the joint statement that said discussions would continue in a ?sincere and purposeful and forward-looking manner for a final settlement? of Kashmir.

 ?I believe this is the most important part of the joint statement, reflecting the will of the leadership to resolve their problems.?

 However, former ISI boss Gul smelt a rat in the joint statement and the talks Musharraf had with Singh, saying Pakistan is gradually moving away from its position of seeking a Kashmir solution under the UN?s resolutions.

 He claimed Musharraf himself admitted that ?Pakistan is coming out of the UN resolutions? in order to consider other options.

 He advised Musharraf to understand the Indian system, adding that there can be no forward movement on Kashmir as long as it continues to be an integral part of India under the Indian constitution.

 ?There can be no real progress on the issue as the Indians have not yet even indicated their willingness to amend their Constitution,? Gul said.

 ?We will eventually alienate the Kashmiris while trying to find a solution.? The situation will aggravate and there will be more bloodshed in Kashmir, he added.

 He warned that the Americans would then jump in and move a resolution in the UN on the third option ? independent Kashmir.

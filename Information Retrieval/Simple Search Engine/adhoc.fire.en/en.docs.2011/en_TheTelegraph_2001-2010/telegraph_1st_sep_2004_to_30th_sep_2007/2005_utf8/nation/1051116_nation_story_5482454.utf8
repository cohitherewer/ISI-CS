 Seething sena plots revenge

 ASHISH SINHA

 Jehanabad, Nov. 15: The alley, in the heart of this dusty town, was not exactly dark or risky, but the masked man asked his boys to keep a watch on the street.

 Barely 100 metres away on the other side, the body of Ranbir Sena top brain Visheshwar Rai, killed by the Maoist rebels on Sunday night, lay in a coffin after the post-mortem. Plans for the funeral were being finalised and a large mob of the samaj, a euphemism for upper-caste Bhumihars, stood waiting for directions.

 This correspondent had been escorted to a small room after repeated requests. What do you want to know? the masked man asked.

 My name is Shamsher Bahadur Singh. Call me Ranbir Sena if you want because that is how the media describes us. We will not reveal our plan (of avenging the Maoist attack on the jail) but I should tell you that we will reply in their (rebels) own language and also teach them some of our language, he added.

 Shamshers senior in the upper-caste army, Butan Chaudhary, now on bail, sat outside on a motorcycle.

 Butan is said to be involved in a series of attacks on Maoist supporters, some of them turning into massacres. With his mentor ? Visheshwar ? lying in a coffin nearby, Butan refused to talk.

 Bhai ke uthne tak koi baat nahi (no talking till my brothers body is cremated). But we will definitely reply back. This (Visheshwars killing) was cowardice. He (Shamsher) is anyway talking to you, Butan said.

 Shamsher was forthcoming. The entire system has failed but we still try to support it. We are nationalists and we support the Constitution. We have made sacrifices. Our forefathers fought for the countrys independence. Now these Leftists (Maoists) are being used as a political weapon against us, he said in sophisticated Hindi.

 Their revolution has gone for a toss. Now they are making random experiments in underdeveloped areas. They have the support of dreaded international organisations. They incite us for no reason and we are ready to fight. We are called Ranbir Sena, Shamsher said.

 We, too, have a large network that extends from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh and right up to Mauritius. Our meetings are on and dont be under the impression that our strength has withered away. You will not have to wait for long to be convinced of that.

 Asked how many of his supporters were taken away by the Maoists, Shamsher said approximately 40.

 We know the fate of those who have been taken away. No one will be spared but it is a matter of chance. We undergo difficult times every day and life has no premium attached in this battle for justice.

 Butan heard every bit of the conversation. He is right in whatever he said. Now you can go away. Only the planning is secret, the fight is very open and direct, he said.

 Butan had earlier appealed to his supporters to bring a yellow shroud (pitambari) to pay homage to Visheshwar. Nearly 50 shrouds surfaced in half an hour.

 Mulayam phone-tap fire at Sonia

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Dec. 30: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today accused Sonia Gandhi of ordering the tapping of phones of Samajwadi Party leaders, dubbing it a conspiracy to topple his government.

 The phones of senior party leaders, including national general secretary Amar Singh, are being tapped at the behest of 10 Janpath, he told a news conference in Lucknow.

 The chief ministers offensive comes in the midst of a raging verbal war between the Samajwadi Party and the Congress. 

 Mulayam Singh (in picture) said Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul had confirmed that Amar Singhs phone was linked to the phone of the Delhi joint commissioner (crime), north zone. He alleged that Sonia was planning to release tapes of his conversations to the media in January.

 Within hours of the blast from Mulayam Singh, the Centre rushed to the Congress presidents rescue, rubbishing the charges as baseless.

 The home ministry issued a press note, which said the matter had been examined by the Delhi police commissioner and the principal secretary (home). The government has registered a case of criminal conspiracy and forgery against unknown persons, including Reliance Infocom whose documents have been cited as the basis of the allegations.

 Sources said a police team searched the south Delhi office of Reliance Infocom and picked up data relating to Amar Singhs phone number.

 Mulayam Singh said he had contacted the Prime Minister, the home minister and the defence minister.

 Tripura is embracing the romance of Kashmir. The fabled houseboats of Dal Lake are being introduced in the 11 lakes inside the Sipahijala wildlife sanctuary, nearly 33 km from Agartala, with the states forest department introducing an ambitious project to woo tourists to the northeastern state.

 Initially, 10 decorated houseboats will be floated on the Amrit Sagar and Kshir Sagar lakes of the sanctuary. If the response is encouraging, they will be floated on all the 11 lakes of the 18.53 square km sanctuary, said P.K. Samanta, wildlife officer in the forest department. 

 Nakul Das, a skilled carpenter from Charilam near Sipahijala, said the boats would be shaped like peacocks. They will be 18 feet long and have living space nine feet long and six feet wide, in accordance with forest department specifications. The boats will be covered and have rooms and facilities to ensure a comfortable stay for a family of four. The interiors will be decorated will cane and bamboo. The launch of houseboats is part of the forest departments efforts to boost eco-tourism. ?We have received central funds for creating new facilities to attract tourists and already three small eco-villages and tree-houses have come up,? Samanta said. 

 Earlier, the department had introduced toy trains, boating and elephant ride in the sanctuary to attract tourists. It had also built a large zoo in 1972. Sources said the wildlife unit of the department has 56 species of animals, six species of primates and 150 species of birds. The sanctuary also hosts migratory birds from Arunachal Pradesh in winter. ?Sipahijala boasts of a large number of spectacled monkeys ? a rare species,? a source said. 

 The crab-eating mongoose, last sighted in the country 75 years ago, is also found in the sanctuary. Sipahijala also has a botanical garden and a research centre. 

 ?There are 256 plant species in the sanctuary, including several varieties of orchids. Natural botanists find it easy to conduct research in our centre,? the source said. 

 The sanctuary, established in 1972, is the fruit of three years of tireless labour by M.A. Khan, former principal chief conservator of forest who retired recently.

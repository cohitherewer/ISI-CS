 Leak stalls medical entrance exam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, May 27: The combined pre-medical test, scheduled to begin today, has been postponed indefinitely following a question-paper leak.

 The special task force of Uttar Pradesh police last night arrested four persons, including a doctor, for the leak. Over 80,000 students are to appear for the test.

 The principal secretary (home), Aloke Sinha, said the STF is conducting further raids to unearth the gang involved in the leak.

 Agra University authorities, who were entrusted to conduct the examinations at 45 centres this year, were taken aback when a group of students informed them last evening that the question-papers were being distributed among some candidates of a coaching centre in Lucknow.

 We examined the question-paper leaked and found it to be genuine. We did not take any chances and called off the test, said Agra University vice-chancellor A.S. Kukla.

 The varsity authorities immediately filed a complaint with the STF and wrote to the government about the leak.

 The superintendent of police in charge of the STF, Akhilesh Kumar, said three police teams conducted raids and arrested four persons, including Mohammad Shahid, a doctor who was running coaching centres for students intending to appear in the medical entrance test.

 Kumar said cash and cheques worth Rs 12 lakh have been seized from Shahid. We are investigating his connections.

 The police suspect that the papers might have been leaked from the Ghaziabad centre.

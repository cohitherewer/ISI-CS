 Pappu ?seer? plea falls flat

 - Apex court cancels bail

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: The Supreme Court today quashed a Patna High Court order granting interim bail to Madhepura MP, Pappu Yadav, and upheld the appeal preferred by the CBI and the brother of the slain CPM leader Ajit Sarkar.

 The apex court, however, adjourned hearing till February 1 on the CBI?s prayer to shift Yadav to a jail in Tamil Nadu or Gujarat in the interest of a free and fair trial. The plea was opposed by Yadav?s counsel, R.K. Jain, who cited a Supreme Court order that even convicted criminals should not be kept too far away from their relatives.

 Last week, Yadav had contended before the court that he should be granted bail as the same relief had been given to the Kanchi seer, arrested in connection with the Shankar Raman murder case.

 A three judge bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde, S.B. Sinha and P.K. Balasubramanyan said the apex court had ?distinguished? the facts of the Sankaracharya case from Yadav?s and the two could not be compared.

 Kalyan Chandra Sarkar, the brother of slain trade union leader Ajit Sarkar, had appealed to the court seeking cancellation of Yadav?s bail. ?While deciding cases on facts, more so in criminal cases, the court should bear in mind that each case must rest on its own facts and the similarity of facts in one case cannot be used to bear in mind the conclusion of fact in another case,? the bench observed.

 However, the judges restrained from analysing the evidence in Yadav?s case. ?It is not necessary for us to weigh the evidence at this stage? and that ?the prosecution has established a prima facie case against the accused?, it said. ?We are also of the opinion that the conduct of the respondent-accused (Yadav) as brought on record clearly indicates that enlarging the said accused on bail would impede the progress of the trial,? the bench further observed.

 Yadav, while in jail at Patna, had allegedly conducted a public meeting inside the jail and liberally used his mobile phone to conduct his ?business?. 

 The court had earlier sought the opinion of two mobile service providers, BSNL and Reliance Infocomm, to explain the modalities of installing jammers in prisons. 

 Additional solicitor-general Amarendra Saran, who appeared for the CBI, narrated the sequence of events and the ?antics? of Yadav and supported Kalyan Sarkar?s plea that Yadav should be transferred outside Bihar. He gave a list of six jails, four in Tamil Nadu and two in Gujarat, where Yadav could be lodged to ensure ?free and fair trial? in the case. 

 Saran told the court that the examination of witnesses, including Yadav, could be done through video-conferencing.

 Senior counsel for Yadav, R.K. Jain, opposed him citing a Supreme Court judgment, which had barred even convicted criminals from being shifted to distant prisons as it would have made it difficult for them to meet relatives and friends. He argued that Yadav was still an undertrial and contended that shifting him to a distant prison would violate his fundamental right to life and liberty.

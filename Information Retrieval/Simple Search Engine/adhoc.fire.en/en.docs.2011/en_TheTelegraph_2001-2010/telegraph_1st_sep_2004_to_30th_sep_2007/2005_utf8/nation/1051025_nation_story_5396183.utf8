 Jai Prakash: Kin chaos

 Patna, Oct. 24: An arrest warrant has been issued against Union minister Jai Prakash Narain Yadav for exerting pressure on police to free his brother after he was arrested on the charge of roaming with a gun on polling day.

 On the other side of the political divide, BJP state chief Sushil Kumar Modi also found himself in trouble with authorities seizing vehicles carrying his bodyguards near Bhagalpur.

 A court in Jamui, 200 km from Patna, issued the warrant against Jai Prakash after the police filed a petition. His brother and Rashtriya Janata Dal candidate from Jamui, Vijay Prakash, was arrested on October 18 for carrying a gun in contravention of rules.

 Charges under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 225 (resistance or obstruction to lawful apprehension of another person) have been pressed against Jai Prakash, the minister of state for water resources in the Manmohan Singh government. He also belongs to the RJD.

 The police had moved court seeking arrest warrants against the minister and others. The warrants were issued today, director-general of police A.R. Sinha said.

 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Shibu Soren had to quit the Union ministry under similar circumstances.

 RJD spokesperson Shivanand Tiwary said there was no question of Jai Prakash resigning. But the NDA demanded his resignation. He should resign at once or the Prime Minister should dismiss him without any delay. Let the law of the land prevail, Janata Dal (United) spokesperson Shambhu Srivastava said.

 Polling for 64 seats in the second phase is scheduled for Wednesday.

 Warrants have also been issued against the ministers brother, Independent candidate Ashok Ram, driver Batohi Yadav and Khaira police station in-charge Mukeshwar Prasad, who is absconding.

 An earlier police probe found that Prasad had freed the accused under pressure from the minister without completing the formalities of granting bail.

 The minister came to the police station with hundreds of his supporters. When I asked the police station in-charge to present the bail papers, he gave blank papers signed by the accused and the guarantors, Jamui deputy superintendent of police Ajay Kumar Pandey has written in his report to police superintendent Ajay Kumar.

 A source close to the minister said he had accused the police of filing a false case against him.

 EC adviser acts

 Modi, too, ran into rough weather with Election Commission adviser K.J. Rao ordering the seizure of a vehicle carrying the BJP leaders bodyguards near Nathnagar in Bhagalpur.

 The commission has debarred bodyguards of politicians from moving in separate vehicles.

 A source in Bhagalpur said Rao, who was in the region to supervise election preparations, spotted the vehicle in which the bodyguards were travelling and ordered its seizure.

 The state BJP president later said permission had been taken for the other vehicle but there was some confusion over the commissions order.

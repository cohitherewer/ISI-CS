 Fear of EC stick drives Sadhu out

 Gopalganj, Feb. 21: A clash between two IAS officers has forced the chief minister?s brother, Sadhu Yadav, to travel to the land of Buddha?s last journey and, if the RJD parliamentarian moves according to his plans, he would soon be seeking Lord Ram?s blessing as well.

 Sadhu is believed to have left Bihar today for neighbouring Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh since Gopalganj, from where he is an MP, has been declared out-of-bounds for him, along with big guns like Kali Pandey, Pappu Pandey and Kiran Devi, till February 27, the day of counting. He also intends to visit Ayodhya during his stay in Uttar Pradesh.

 As for the two IAS officers, the stand of the junior among them, Gopalganj district magistrate K.K. Pathak, has been upheld by the Election Commission, which has summoned divisional commissioner Gopal Shankar Prasad to Delhi to explain his position.

 Prasad had quashed the district magistrate?s order to declare Sadhu Yadav a ?zilla badar?, a phrase that has entered the rich poll-time lexicon, and roughly means orders to an individual to keep off a district. The poll panel sided with the district magistrate.

 Sadhu?s position is not a cause of envy, because his wife, Indira Yadav is contesting the Gopalganj seat as an Independent, despite the RJD fielding Ambika Prasad Yadav as its official candidate. The MP?s sister, chief minister Rabri Devi, and brother-in-law Laloo Prasad Yadav have already campaigned for the RJD candidate ? and even raised some voices against Indira.

 Sadhu, whose palatial house here is being used as Indira?s election office, had been in a tight spot because, as a ?true soldier of the RJD?, he could not campaign for his wife. But family ties had compelled him to be Indira?s invisible shield and Sadhu was doing all he could do to help his wife?s campaign.

 ?People wanted me to fight and that is why I am in the field. I do not have any competition and I will win with a huge margin,? Indira told The Telegraph during her campaign near the local sugar mill. 

 ?I am your daughter and you just have to remember cup-and-saucer, my election symbol,? she reminded an elderly voter. Sadhu was the Gopalganj MLA and he vacated the seat after being elected to the Lok Sabha from here.

 But Indira is not the sole ?family rebel? from the district. Sadhu?s eldest brother, Prabhunath Yadav, is also contesting as an Independent from neighbouring Mirganj, on the same cup-and-saucer symbol.

 ?We initially believed that the family feud was artificial. We thought that Laloo Prasad wanted to give the message that he would not give tickets even to his family members. But now we realise that he did not want Indira and Prabhunath to contest and they jumped into the fray despite this. It obviously indicates a deeper crisis in the family,? said an RJD leader.

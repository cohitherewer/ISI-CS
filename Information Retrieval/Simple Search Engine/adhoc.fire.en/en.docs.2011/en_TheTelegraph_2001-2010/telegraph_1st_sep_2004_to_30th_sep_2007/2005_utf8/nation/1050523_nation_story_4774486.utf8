 Daughter sold for Rs 10000

 SHASHANK SHEKHAR

 Bokaro, May 22: The lid has been blown off a sex racket patronised by government officials and company executives a day when a schoolgirl from Bengal escaped to freedom after being sold off by her parents for Rs 10,000. 

 The 15-year-old girl, a student of Class VI in a government school in Howrah, was sold by her parents to Radhey Shyam Gupta, a resident of Bokaro, for Rs 10,000 last week. The 50-year-old man was introduced to the girl as her mama (maternal uncle), who, her parents said, had come to take her on an excursion during the summer holidays. 

 The girls father is a boatman and has two daughters and a son. The parents reached Bokaro today to take their daughter back. 

 Police sources said Gupta, accompanied by the girl, left Howrah on Thursday by the Coalfield Express and reached Dhanbad around 11 pm. From there, they took a bus for Guptas home in Chas, around 50 km away. There she was kept in a separate room and given dinner. 

 Early on Friday, the complaint filed by the girl with the Chas police station says, Gupta entered the room and raped her. Soon after, the man called more than a dozen persons from his mobile phone (which is now in police custody), informing them that a new girl has arrived from Calcutta. 

 On Friday night, two persons, in their late forties, reached Guptas home and assaulted the girl, but were not satisfied by her behaviour. Angered by the complaints, Gupta beat the girl with a stick and ordered her to do what she was told. She was locked up, but around 2 am, she escaped from another door, which was not locked, and climbed up to the roof from where she jumped off. Gupta heard the thud, came out and gave chase but a security guard of a sweet shop came to the girls rescue. He informed the police, who escorted the girl to the police station. 

 On her complaint, the Guptas house was raided and the man arrested.

 The police chanced upon a diary maintained by Gupta, which, according to the officials, lists names of several executives of a public sector company, politicians and businessmen. The police also called for questioning three executives of the PSU and a couple of businessman who had made calls to Guptas cellphone. 

 The men, whose wives were also called, were let off after they promised to behave themselves in future.

 Speaking to The Telegraph before going to jail, Gupta admitted he had paid Rs 5,000 as advance to the girls parents. I know this was wrong but even the girls parents were aware why their daughter was being brought to Bokaro, he said. 

 The girls father refused to comment, but her mother admitted they had struck a deal with Gupta.

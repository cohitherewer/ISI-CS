 Storm over Singh US trip dies down

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Basu: Satisfied

New Delhi, July 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seems to have defused the tension building up between the UPA and the Left over his America trip, at least for the time being.

 The Prime Ministers statement in general (in Parliament) was okay, veteran CPM leader Jyoti Basu said on the last day of the partys politburo meeting.

 Singh had yesterday assured Parliament the joint Indo-US statement would not in any way jeopardise Indias national concerns.

 Senior politburo member Sitaram Yechury indicated Singhs statement reflected the Lefts concerns. We believe the US has not given enough assurance (for Indias inclusion in the exclusive nuclear club or the Security Council). The Prime Minister indicated the same.

 In his statement, Singh had said: Our commitments would be conditional upon and reciprocal to the US fulfilling its side of the understanding.

 The joint agreement was founded on the principle of non-discrimination and India would not tolerate any discrimination when it placed its civilian facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, he added.

 Yechury, however, said the CPM would raise its concerns during the scheduled discussion on the US visit in both Houses on August 3. We will place our views in Parliament. India must not weaken its economic and political sovereignty, he said.

 We want full nuclear disarmament, the CPM leader reiterated, although Singh had said India remained committed to full nuclear disarmament, a policy Rajiv Gandhi followed.

 Till yesterday, the Left had accused the government of taking a pro-US stance. Today, it seemed to have piped down. The Left also does not wish to be seen as siding with the BJP, which had levelled the same charge as the Left, during the House discussion.

 Yechury reiterated the US was not helping the fight against terror by its operations in Iraq. How has the US invasion of Iraq helped bring down terrorism? he asked, pointing to the recent London bombings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Behind Great Wall, positive pragmatism

 JEHANGIR S. POCHA

 Wen Jiabao in Bangalore

 Beijing, April 17: The positive but restrained commentary in the state-controlled media here after Premier Wen Jiabao?s visit to India contrasts with the enthusiasm that preceded the trip.

 Before Wen left for South Asia, state-controlled media, such as the People?s Daily, had highlighted his terming of the impending visit to India ?historic? and emphasised Wen?s recitation of a Sanskrit shloka from the Upanishads to call for closer ties. 

 But while most newspapers and websites gave the visit wide coverage, the reports later had a distinctly business-like tone, indicating that Chinese authorities are taking a more measured view of ties with India. 

 ?China develops economic and trade relations with South Asia based on quality and mutual benefit, and the two sides have great potential in this regard, although the scale of the economic and trade cooperation is still small,? Xinhua, the state-run wire service, said on April 12, the last day of the Premier?s visit. 

 The optimism expressed in the Indian media over the new guiding principles on the boundary dispute was also missing here and most publications referred to the problem in almost the same tone as in previous years. 

 ?The two sides expressed satisfaction over the progress made in the discussions between the special representatives of the two countries and welcomed the conclusion of the agreement on the political parameters and guiding principles for the settlement of the boundary question,? Xinhua reported. 

 What was missing in the Chinese media?s coverage of Wen?s visit was almost as important as what was said. Almost no reference was made to China?s backhanded recognition of Sikkim as an integral part of India. Also missing was any mention of Wen?s reported comment supporting India?s entry into the Security Council. 

 With Wen?s visit marked by the lack of any real news conferences and both Chinese and Indian diplomats being very cagey about how the closed-door meetings actually went, visibility of the real or perceived shortcomings felt by either side is dim. 

 Sources said the Chinese side was more than a trifle annoyed by the organisation around the trip ? most notably, the success a Tibetan protester had in penetrating security in Bangalore, as well as the behaviour of the Indian media, which often harangued the visitors for comments and often talked loudly among themselves at conferences while speeches were on. 

 More substantially, while both sides maintained the agreed mantras of how Sino-Indo cooperation has the potential to change the current world order and herald in the ?Asian Century?, Chinese diplomats said privately that they were surprised to see India continuing to develop much closer ties with the US. 

 Natwar and George W. Bush

 It was not overlooked by the Chinese delegation that the very day after Wen left New Delhi, external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh left for Washington to help finalise plans for President George W. Bush?s visit to India later this year. 

 That the trip was more measured than media excitement that preceded it ?is actually a good thing?, said a Chinese official. ?Serious work is to be done and what is clear is that (neither side) is willing to give too much to the other for the sake of it.? 

 Perhaps the most significant difference between the coverage of Wen?s tour in the Indian and Chinese media was that while the former largely ignored the Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan leg of the tour, the latter gave those countries substantial coverage. 

 Although Indian security experts lauded India for not fixating on Pakistan and Beijing?s close ties with Islamabad during this trip as has been the habit in the past, ignoring China?s deepening ties with Pakistan has its own dangers. 

 This is particularly so as the agreements Wen inked with Pakistan were far more substantive than the more rhetorical gestures made in India. 

 Foremost among these was the start of work on the Gwadar port, funded and built by China, which security experts say could pose a significant threat to Indian shipping and oil supplies. 

 Indian officials gave no clear indication about whether this and other similar issues were discussed by Wen and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, even as local media here were lauding the government for securing the country?s interests in the Indian Ocean and south-central Asian region.

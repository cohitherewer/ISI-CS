 Cong chief slams Opposition for boycott

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Jind (Haryana), May 14: Sonia Gandhi today blasted the BJP-led Opposition, calling its Parliament boycott an irresponsible step during her dhanyavad (thanksgiving) rally here. 

 The Congress presidents criticism came at a time when relations between the ruling UPA and the Opposition have hit a new low after the government targeted defence and divestment deals struck by two NDA ministers ? George Fernandes and Arun Shourie. 

 Sonia was at the Police Lines grounds to thank the people of Haryana for handing the Congress victory in the February Assembly elections. With an over two-lakh turnout, there was pandemonium with creaking barricades collapsing under the pressure of the mammoth crowd.

 I am happy with the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh at the Centre. Despite constraints of running a coalition government, I am satisfied with its performance, the Congress chief said.

 She pointed out that when the UPA was formed, the Opposition had said the Congress would not be able to run a government. Now that it has completed one year, they are saying it will not last too long.

 Lambasting the BJP-led coalition for boycotting House proceedings, Sonia said: They (the Opposition parties) are not playing their role. They have held Parliament to ransom by boycotting it and have not allowed the passage of the Employment Guarantee Bill that would have helped millions of people. The BJP and its allies have not behaved responsibly. They are playing with the future of the country. They are not acting with honesty. 

 The crowd, some of them precariously perched atop a huge pandal, cheered loudly when Sonia said the Assembly poll win in Haryana was not a victory of the Congress, but the victory of the people. 

 Let us together turn the results into one of unparalleled development. It is our raj dharma, she said, her voice fading into the din. 

 I have told the chief minister (Bhupinder Singh Hooda) that hamari kahni aur karni mein koi farak nahin hona chahiye.

 Srinagar, Nov. 15: Grenades burst and blood flowed in the Valley for the second successive day as militants targeted a PDP rally this afternoon, killing three persons and wounding several.

 The grenade landed near former tourism minister Ghulam Hassan Mirs bullet-proof car just as the crowds were thinning after he finished speaking in his home constituency of Tangmarg, 45 km west of Srinagar.

 Mir, who was recently dropped from the state cabinet after Mufti Mohammad Sayeed stepped down as chief minister, narrowly escaped the burst but suffered splinter wounds.

 Fifty-five others, including the local sub divisional police officer, the station house officer and four policemen, were injured. Three persons died in hospital and five are believed to be critical.

 People were writhing around me covered in blood, Sanam Tasuduq, a witness, said.

 The attack came as security forces battling suicide attackers holed up in two hotels in high-security Lal Chowk since yesterday managed to grab one alive and kill the other.

 The militants had lobbed grenades at a CRPF bunker when a crowd of shoppers, commuters and students just released from school were milling in the area. They then rushed into the Punjab and Peak View hotels. The gun battle had been raging since.

 Five persons, including two paramilitary personnel and two civilian bystanders, were killed and 16 injured in the 36-hour standoff that ended today.

 State DGP Gopal Sharma told newspersons the arrested militant had tried to break the cordon security forces laid around the hotels and was trapped.

 He has been identified as Aijaz Ahmad Bhat alias Abu Sumana of the Lashkar-e-Toiba. He belongs to Faisalabad in Pakistan.

 Sharma said this was the first time a holed-up fidayeen had been arrested alive. His interrogation is on. It is likely that disclosures by the militant who infiltrated after the October 8 quake would lead to many valuable inputs to combat militancy.

 He said the security forces had proceeded with great caution to ensure there was no loss of civilian lives and damage to property in the crowded shopping area. 

 All entry points to Lal Chowk had been sealed and civilian movement blocked through the length of the encounter, he said.

 We moved very carefully as the area is densely populated and major business establishments are located there, he said.

 Congress courts comrades

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 16: The Congress leadership will try to coax its Left comrades to attend the May 22 celebrations to mark the UPA governments one year in power, though Congress president Sonia Gandhi has said the Lefts decision to give the bash a miss would not dampen the spirit of the occasion.

 Sonia, however, added that she would wait till the UPA-Left co-ordination committee meeting on May 18 when a final decision on this is expected to emerge. We are looking forward to exchanging views (with the Left) on everything at the meeting, she said. 

 Congress general secretary Ambika Soni also dropped hints that efforts were on to bring the Left on board for the celebrations. 

 There are people (Congress leaders) entrusted with the job of interacting with them (Left leaders). There is also a meeting between the UPA and Left leaders on May 18, she said while briefing newspersons on the Congress Working Committee meeting this morning. The partys plans to mark May 22 were discussed there. Sonia, too, was present.

 Making a strong case for Left attendance on May 22, Soni said the UPAs common minimum programme has been the guiding document for the government. 

 There may be differences in perception about its implementation, but the government has worked within the broad parameters laid down by the document, she said. In a larger sense, we (the alliance partners) all have worked together.

 There was also an indication of the Congresss keenness to win over the Left for the Sunday bash in the priorities spelt out at the working committee meeting by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the UPAs second year in office. Singh is expected to make a similar presentation on Wednesday at the co-ordination committee meet. 

 In what could be seen as a concession to the Left parties, Singh said the governments agenda would focus on the rural and social sectors, though not at the cost of infrastructure investment imperatives. 

 Singh said agriculture, rural infrastructure, education and health and rural drinking water would be on top and his government would have to find sources of funding these areas. 

 Quoting the Prime Minister, Soni said these programmes would also generate rural employment, an issue that has the Left parties raising their voices.

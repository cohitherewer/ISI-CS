 Jaya strike sword back in sheath

 Jayalalithaa: Eye on poll

 Chennai, July 18: The sword of Damocles that so long hung over government officials and teachers will soon be sheathed.

 Chief minister Jayalalithaa today announced that the notification banning strikes by Tamil Nadu government employees will not be renewed after it expires on July 23.

 The notification, under the Tamil Nadu Essential Services Maintenance Act, had been issued in July 2003 after state staff and teachers went on an indefinite strike to press for their demands. Nearly 1.75 lakh employees were sacked as Jayalalithaa cracked the whip, sparking widespread protests.

 Among those who spoke out against the move was Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the chief minister of Left-ruled Bengal. Most of the sacked employees were, however, taken back after the Supreme Court intervened.

 Jayalalithaa hoped her governments decision to let the notification lapse would motivate state employees, including teachers, to serve the people better.

 Government employees and teachers should reciprocate by always adhering to the path of understanding, discipline and good service to the public, resolving any issues only by mutual discussions and totally abjuring practices that affected the people, the ADMK leader said.

 The move, in a pre-election year, came along with another sop. The chief minister, who emphasised her regimes commitment to provide benefits to government employees, also announced a three-percentage point increase in dearness allowance with effect from July 1, 2005.

 The additional DA to 12.33 lakh government employees and teachers, besides 4.87 lakh pensioners, will cost the exchequer Rs 201.23 crore a year.

 Left parties, in particular, welcomed Jayalalithaas decision not to renew the draconian notification, which was being extended every three months despite her goodwill package last October after the drubbing her party got in the 2004 general elections.

 This has been made possible because of the agitation of the entire working people throughout the country and has come before the all-India strike called by central trade unions on July 29, said T.K. Rangarajan, a senior leader of the Citu, the CPMs labour wing.

 We welcome Jayalalithaas belated decision, though it is primarily done with an eye on the coming Assembly elections, Rangarajan said. But the government, he added, should scrap the act itself, which is our basic demand.

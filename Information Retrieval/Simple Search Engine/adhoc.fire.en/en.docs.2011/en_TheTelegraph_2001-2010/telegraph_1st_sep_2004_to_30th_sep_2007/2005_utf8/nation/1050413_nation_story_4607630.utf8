 Wen leaves govt holding UN puzzle

 Wen: Tightlipped

 New Delhi, April 12: Beijing?s stand on India?s aspiration for a UN Security Council seat is fast turning into a Chinese puzzle that South Block mandarins are finding hard to solve.

 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said: ?We attach great importance to the role of India in international affairs. India is a very populous country and is also a very important developing country. 

 ?We fully understand and support the Indian aspiration to play an even bigger role in international affairs including in the UN.? But he did not add the crucial line Delhi wanted to hear ? that China would support India?s candidature.

 There are a number of proposals on how the Security Council should be expanded or restructured. But the UN secretary-general?s panel report talks broadly about Plan A and B. The first proposes including five more countries as permanent members, but without veto power. The second talks about membership on rotation, with fixed tenures.

 China, like most other Permanent Five members, holds that there should be a consensus on bringing in the new members but they should not have veto power. India, though opposed to the proposal in public, has almost come to terms with the realisation that if it wants to join the UN, it may have to do so without veto power.

 Yesterday, Wen is reported to have told his Indian hosts that China would ?welcome India?s emergence in the UN Security Council?. Delhi saw these as encouraging words tantamount to Beijing?s support for India?s candidature. 

 However, his remarks hours before he left for Beijing after a ?historic? visit to India have raised more questions than answers.

 Chinese sources said the Premier?s remarks were best seen as an assurance from Beijing that it would not stand in the way of India getting into the Security Council. ?It is not possible for Premier Wen to give China?s support to India?s candidature in the elite body,? the sources added.

 Not to be outdone, Indian spin doctors made a valiant attempt at saying that Wen had assured China?s support in private discussions with the leadership. But he could not articulate it yet in public because of the present strain in China?s ties with Japan. As Japan is also a contender for a Security Council seat, Beijing has thought it best not to be categorical about its support to anyone.

 Wen made this point clear during his interaction with journalists this morning. ?Last century, the aggression waged by Japan inflicted tremendous sufferings and hardships on people in China, Asia and the world at large,? Wen said and referred to demonstrations in China and elsewhere in Asia against Japan?s attempt to enter the Security Council.

 Marital drama at SP meet

 - Couple trades charges

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, April 21: A marital drama was enacted on the sidelines of the Samajwadi Party national convention, which ended with the woman and her husband being escorted to the Kotwali police station as they hurled wild allegations against one another.

 The interesting part was that the lady-in-distress said her rising graph in Mulayam Singh Yadav?s party was the main cause for her husband?s bruised male ego, besides his alleged dowry demands. 

 The man, however, stood his ground and claimed that the young child, six-month pregnant with his baby, was unfolding a pack of lies.

 Sandwiched between the two, the law-enforcers, city police superintendent Shalin to be exact, fumbled in their ?determination? to reach to the root of the story, in which the names of Laloo Prasad Yadav and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh were dropped with ease.

 In her early thirties, Anita Singh, a native of Deoria near Gorakhpur but a resident of Delhi, alleged that her husband, Manish Singh, who drove down on her trail from the Uttar Pradesh town in an Esteem, attempted to kidnap her in Patna this morning.

 ?I had come here to attend my party?s convention. I was taking some women for breakfast near Gandhi Maidan, the venue of the meeting. Suddenly, my husband came to the spot in a car with a few others and forcibly drove away with me. I raised an alarm. Police acted promptly and the vehicle was soon intercepted,? she said.

 The police confirmed this part of the story. Shalin said a message was flashed to all checkposts and the car was intercepted at Dak Bungalow Chowk, the heart of the capital. ?We are further investigating the case,? he added.

 Anita, who claimed to be a graduate from Delhi?s Lady Sri Ram College, said she was married in June last year but had joined the Samajwadi Party much earlier in 1994. ?I was influenced by Amar Singh and Raja Bhaiya, especially because I am Kshatriya. My marriage was arranged and my husband did not like my political activities,? she said.

 She alleged that her father, Harendra Pratap Singh, who was once officer-on-special-duty to Laloo Prasad, had spent whatever he could on her marriage. ?But my husband is now demanding a car, my father?s flat in Delhi and my fixed deposits worth Rs 5 lakh. During Diwali last year, he even beat me up in Delhi when I was going to Amar Singh?s place. He doesn?t care that I am pregnant,? Anita said.

 But the man, a petty contractor-cum-businessman, said Anita had cooked up a ?cock-and-bull story?. ?I told her not to come to Patna because she was carrying a baby. But she instead told me to come here as well. I reached here this morning and went to the station to fetch her because she said she would come by Poorva Express. But she had already reached by an earlier train,? he said.

 ?She had called me to Gandhi Maidan. I went there in my car. She was with some other women. I told her to come inside the car so that we could talk. We began to drive after she came in. But soon she raised an alarm,? Manish said.

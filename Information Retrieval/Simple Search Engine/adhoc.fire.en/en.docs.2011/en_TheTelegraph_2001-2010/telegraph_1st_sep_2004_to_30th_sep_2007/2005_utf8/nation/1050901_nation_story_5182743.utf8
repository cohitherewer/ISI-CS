 Bharat lessons for Rahul

 Rahul: Going rural

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: From Afghanistan nirman to Bharat Nirman.

 After his weekend introduction to the world of diplomacy, Rahul Gandhi landed up at a lecture on rural development today, in a sign that his political grooming had been put on the fast track.

 The Congress heir apparent spent close to two hours at Yojana Bhavan, the Planning Commission headquarters, watching a presentation by US-based venture capitalist Vinod Khosla. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has met Khosla, is believed to have got top policy-makers in the country to interact with him. 

 Hours after the morning meeting, Congress sources revealed that Rahul may be inducted into the partys working committee ? its highest decision-making body ? at the rescheduled Congress plenary session in Hyderabad on October 20-23.

 The man who got the Amethi MP to step inside Yojana Bhavan for the first time was Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

 Just as the Prime Minister had casually asked Rahul to be part of his diplomatic team to Afghanistan, Ahluwalia is understood to have invited him to be among todays select audience of about a dozen.

 Sources said Rahul sat quietly through Khoslas detailed presentation on Bicycle commute economy: model for rural India and Ahluwalias concluding observations. He did not speak, though he informally interacted with Khosla and others.

 But once out of the conference room, Rahul, who had avoided the press during his two-day stay in Kabul, told a posse of waiting journalists that he had his own ideas about rural India.

 For instance, he said, micro-financing schemes for rural development have not been working ? not in Amethi, not anywhere else. He blamed it on caste: the upper castes grab everything.

 Khosla, an IIT Delhi graduate who rose in Silicon Valley as a founder CEO of Sun Microsystems, suggested the Centre set up 5,000-6,000 economic and service hubs across India to narrow the gap between funding and achievement. The rural hubs will provide such services as health, education and information.

 The distance between any two will be small enough for villagers to cover it on bicycle. These hubs will help ensure a rural economic growth rate of at least 5-6 per cent compared with todays 2-3 per cent, Khosla argued.

 Rahul seemed impressed with Khoslas ideas. The country can progress with economic and service clusters across rural India, the Congress MP said as he left Yojana Bhavan. The NRI was in Hyderabad yesterday to sell his ideas to chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy.

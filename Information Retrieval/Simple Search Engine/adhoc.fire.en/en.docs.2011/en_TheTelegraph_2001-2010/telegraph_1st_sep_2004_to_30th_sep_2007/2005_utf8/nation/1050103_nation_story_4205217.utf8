 Demand for job policy

 PRAMOD KUMAR PATNAIK 

 Sambalpur, Jan. 2: Keeping in view the process of massive industrialisation in the state, particularly in the backward areas, former member of Parliament and convener of People?s Initiative for Development (PID), Bhawani Shanker Hota has demanded that chief minister Naveen Patnaik form a specific employment policy in the state.

 Without such a policy, the very purpose of creating employment opportunities for educated youths through industrialisation would just fizzle out, Hota said.

 In a statement, Hota said industries of different nature ? mining, power and core sector ? have either come up or in the process of coming in the backward areas of the state.

 During appointment to various posts ? even in class III and IV ? the local unemployed youths are ignored due to the lack of a clear employment policy. 

 The most dangerous case is that on the basis of the fraudulent domicile certificates, outsiders in large numbers are being appointed, the case of Indian Aluminium Company Limited, Hirakud, a prime example, Hota said. 

 The claim of other industries that to give local employment is beyond their capacity, is nothing but a design to hoodwink the local population. Bhusan Steel?s recent announcement on a similar line is another instance.

 In this context, Hota has urged the government to frame a concrete employment policy with a provision for 100 per cent employment to land oustees, 25 per cent to local residents likely to be affected and 25 per cent to unemployed in administrative and revenue divisions of the units.

 Such reservation is to be made for class IV, III and II posts of technical and general nature.

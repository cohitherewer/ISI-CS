 Outside or inside, border fence makes all happy

 Maltipur (Jammu), June 21: Every morning, nine-year-olds Sakina and Rabeena strap on their schoolbags and walk along the muddy track to the border fence, show their identity cards and cross over.

 The fencing along the Line of Control and international border, built to keep out militants, has left their village, Digwar, on the Pakistani side.

 The fence also cuts Dalan in two, running between tailor Bagdad Shahs home and shop, forcing the 35-year-old to walk across to the unprotected side every day for a living.

 Neither the Class II students nor the tailor have any complaint.

 After all, this is for our good, notes Bagdad. This fence and the ceasefire have given us a normal and peaceful life.

 He says even his customers have no problem crossing over, and his earning has gone up since the fence was erected.

 Sakina and Rabeena, too, feel safer going to school in Dalan now. They recall how they would crouch on the ground, cowering, during the frequent shootouts between the Indian and Pakistani troops before the fence came up in March this year.

 We could hardly go to our schools then as our parents were too scared to let us out of our homes, Sakina says.

 The barbed wire fence, erected by the army along the 720-km LoC and 200-km international border in Jammu and Kashmir, apparently protects people on both sides.

 The fence runs inside Indian territory, about 500 metres to 2 km from the LoC or border. It, thus, leaves some 25 villages in mountainous Poonch and Rajouri outside, say state government officials.

 There are villagers who live inside the fence but have fields outside, or the other way round, says Major Sandeep Soni, commanding the forward post at Maltipur, a village 245 km northwest of Jammu that lies outside the fence.

 A bus arrives at the gate and stops for a security check. One of those who gets down is Alam Bee, a middle-aged widow from Poonch town, who is a trainer with the Vocational Training Centre, Digwar, set up by the army to give free stitching and embroidery lessons to girls living near the LoC.

 Bee and other women passengers walk towards a tent where they are frisked by local women volunteers and given the go-ahead.

 Bee, too, attributes the return of normality to the fence and the ceasefire. Earlier (during the regular firings across the LoC), we used to feel like prisoners for whom, at times, life outside the home was out of bounds. She said the fence has also kept militancy away from the area.

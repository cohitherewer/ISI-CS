The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cricket official swipe at Zee cry for crores

 Whose loss was it? Rahul Dravid in action during a Test match against Australia in Mumbai in November 2004

Calcutta, April 2: Zee Telefilms has demanded 

its pound of flesh from the cricket board for ?arbitrarily? cancelling telecast 

rights to the company last September.

 In a letter to the Board of Control for Cricket in India and its former boss Jagmohan Dalmiya, Zee said it intended to claim Rs 1,630 crore in damages from the cricket body and 31 affiliated associations for causing it ?irreparable? damage.

 Madras High Court had on March 21 called the cancellation of telecast rights ?improper and vitiated by arbitrariness and unfair action?. 

 It had also given Zee the option to sue the cricket board in a civil court.

 Zee Telefilms executive vice-president Himanshu Mody today claimed the cricket body and Dalmiya had ?jointly and severally acted in bad faith? to cause ?irreparable? loss to the company.

 ?Even if the telecast is now awarded to us, the delay in the award and the consequent delay in the launch of our sports channel? has already caused a loss that we are entitled to claim from the BCCI and Mr Dalmiya,? he said in the letter.

 Zee said it had engaged ?a leading international accounting firm to prepare a detailed report calculating the damages? and the preliminary estimate was Rs 1,630 crore.

 ?We have written to the BCCI president several times for an amicable solution but received no response. Thus we were forced to take this line,? Zee vice-president Ashish Kaul said.

 Group chief Subhash Chandra had personally written to board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra in February to mutually sort out the issue.

 Zee is, however, still willing to look for a ?negotiated solution?. It has invited the BCCI to form a committee to jointly consider the settlement of telecast rights and arrive at a consensus figure. 

 ?This is our last effort. If they do not respond in a week then we will move court,? Kaul said.

 Reacting to Zee?s letter from Mumbai, BCCI vice-president Kamal Morarka said: ?They are very consistent with their attempts to create problems, that has to be admitted.

 ?We have already challenged the decision awarded by Madras High Court and will deal with this letter as necessary.?

 Morarka said the damages sought were not a cause for worry. ?The numbers only look big on paper. I think some TV companies are taking a little more interest in the telecast rights matter than they should.?

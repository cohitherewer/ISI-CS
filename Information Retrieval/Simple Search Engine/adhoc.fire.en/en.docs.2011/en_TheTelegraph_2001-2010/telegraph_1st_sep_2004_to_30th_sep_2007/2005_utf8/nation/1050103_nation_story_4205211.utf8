 Drama fest leaves tips to ponder

 - Sambalpuri plays make a mark 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sambalpur, Jan. 2: The eighth Veer Surendra Sai Sambalpuri Natak Mahoschav that ended on Thursday night left a number of messages to think about.

 The most important being the festival that began seven years ago by Yuba Udayan, a leading socio-cultural organisation of Sambalpur, has virtually turned into a movement casting its net wider and attracting more script writing in Sambalpuri.

 Many other organisations are also organising similar festivals for Sambalpuri drama at different places of western Orissa, said Priyaranjan Sahu one of the organisers of the Natak Mahoschav. 

 Last day?s play was Chithi (Letter) by Navajeevan, a dramatic society of Sundargarh. 

 Writer and director Pradeep Bhol has successfully portrayed the different characters of a human being in a family as well as society.

 While parents gear up to auction letters of their ageing father, an age-old freedom fighter, who received them from Mahatma Gandhi, a young girl of the family made her grandfather promise that he wouldn?t hand over the letters to anybody at any cost.

 The climax is when the old man tears up the letters and gulps it down to save them from being auctioned.

 Though in the end he has to give up his life, the old man did not deviate from his Gandhian principles. 

 The girl later leaves her lover, a research scholar in History, after he instigated her parents to get the letters from the old man for a public auction that could have fetched them crores of rupees. 

 The drama reveals the different faces of humans within a family. The role of the house servant was another successful ploy in the drama carrying a dose of humour. 

 The next play, Samkol, which portrays a issue related to water and the crisis people will face in future in its absence. 

 While multinational companies of different developed nations make a whopping profit of Rs 3. 15 lakh crore a year, it is the poor who are to bear the brunt in future.

 Water, a gift of nature, has turned out a purchasable commodity even costlier than milk.

 Mahavir Sanskritik Anusthan of Bhawanipatna performed a play with a message to get ready for a water crisis in future and to take precautionary measures to prevent it, as it is possible with a bit of awareness. 

 There were 26 plays enacted on different days with cultural troupes from all over western Orissa taking part and their performance highly appreciated by the viewers. 

 The presence of thousands of viewers amid the cold confirmed their popularity. 

 At the same time, those belonging to other parts of Orissa and had witnessed the dramas, failed to get the feel of the problems and thus could not understand it, said a person, Dibakar Sarangi of Nayagarh.

 A-I calls agents to talks table

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 9: Nine days of boycott and a travel bandh later, Air-India has invited agitating travel agents for a dialogue.

 The agents today received a written communiqu? from the national carrier, inviting them to resolve differences across the table.

 ?We have just received the message and hopefully things will work out now. We are now monitoring the situation (and) will hopefully have a solution on our hands soon,? said Sanjoy Sett, the chairman (eastern region) of the Travel Agents? Association of India.

 For the past several days, travel agents have been boycotting Air-India after it decided to slash commission against ticket sales from 7 to 5 per cent. Two days ago, all the associations of the agents decided to boycott a European airline as well, known to be supporting Air-India?s move.

 ?As a result of the development, we have decided to hold our agitation against the European airline for the moment,? Sett added.

 In Calcutta, many people had to either buy tickets at higher rates from the airport or offices of international airlines or postpone their visit by at least a day.

 ?Not all people know that international tickets purchased from travel agents come at least 20 per cent cheaper than purchasing from the airline office itself. It is unfortunate that some Calcuttans had to pay more to travel, but with the talks with Air-India planned for early next week, there should be a solution at hand,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (eastern region) of Travel Agents? Federation of India.

 Bull shift raises slaughter stink in MP

 Bhopal, Sept. 14: The Babulal Gaur government kicked up a storm in Madhya Pradesh today, permitting the slaughter of bulls or bullocks provided they were over 15 years old, unfit for work or breeding but healthy enough for human consumption.

 Gaur claimed that he was forced to do so because of an interim Supreme Court order, but the ruling BJP found it difficult to stomach.

 The presence of former chief minister Uma Bharti, a strong votary of banning slaughter of bulls and bullocks, paved the way for mutiny. By late evening, Archana Chitnis, the minister holding charge of animal husbandry and cow conservation, claimed that the courts ruling was restricted to the petitioners alone. 

 But her contention was challenged by Vivek Tankha, the states former advocate- general, who pointed out that in principle the ruling applied universally. A model government must understand the spirit of law, Tankha said. 

 Chitnis said Madhya Pradesh, along with two other BJP-ruled states Rajasthan and Gujarat, would strengthen the legal machinery fighting the case in the Supreme Court. 

 Uma did not say much publicly, except terming the development unfortunate and hoped Gaur had strong reasons to reverse the slaughter ban slapped by her as chief minister.

 I have not seen the court order, she said.

 Against the ban introduced by her government, Sheikh Nazir Qureshi and a few others first went to Jabalpur High Court and then to the Supreme Court, which gave the petitioners interim relief.

 Yesterday, the states animal husbandry department passed an order permitting Qureshi and a few others to slaughter bulls and bullocks.

 J.P. Dhanopia, the head of the state Congress legal cell, said the Gaur government was trying to cover itself with a fig leaf when none existed. Everyone will get the same relief, so there is little point in permitting a few and restraining others.

 Late in the evening, Uma called on Gaur to register her protest before leaving for Chennai where a BJP national executive starts in two days. 

 In Madhya Pradesh, bulls and bullocks have been an emotive political issue. While the Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Cattle Preservation Rules, 1959, permitted slaughter, the BJP regime amended the act in 1991 banning it. The Congress returned to power in 1993 and reversed the change.

 In 2003, when Uma led the campaign against the Digvijay Singh government, she made slaughter an election issue and in March 2004, amended the act after snatching power.

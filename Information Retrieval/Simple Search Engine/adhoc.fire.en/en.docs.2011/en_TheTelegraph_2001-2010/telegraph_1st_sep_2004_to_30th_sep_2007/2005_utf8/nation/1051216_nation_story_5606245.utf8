The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Big B fan

 Mumbai, Dec. 15 (PTI): Amitabh Bachchans 68-year-old fan G.M. Saudagar who has a big collection of photographs of the actor, including those of his wedding with Jaya, has a reason to smile.

 Bachchan has requested him to spare his wedding photographs as his own album was destroyed in the recent floods in Mumbai, Saudagar said.

 I have already made a set of photographs and will hand (them) over to Bachchan sahab once he returns home, he said. 

 Saudagar had met Bachchan on October 11 ? the actors birthday ? and showed him the photographs.

 Saudagar ? Bachchan played in an award-winning movie by the same name ? has been visiting the actor on his birthday every year for the last 15 years and Bachchan has also made it a point to meet him. 

 The Bachchan admirer offered a special prayer at the Haji Ali Dargah on Thursday for the wellbeing of his icon, who recently underwent intestinal surgery here, and offered prasad to his secretary. I wish him a speedy recovery and my best wishes are always with him, he said.

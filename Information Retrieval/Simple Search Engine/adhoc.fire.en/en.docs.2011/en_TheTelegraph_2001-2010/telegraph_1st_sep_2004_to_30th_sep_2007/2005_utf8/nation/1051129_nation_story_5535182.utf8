 Stone amp; snub for Uma

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Nov. 28: Bloodshed, a bomb hoax, a war of words and a walkout ? Shivraj Singh Chauhan was today elected chief minister of Madhya Pradesh with a lot of fanfare.

 Loser Uma Bharti cut a lonely figure. Facing a certain expulsion from the BJP, the sadhvi embarked on yet another yatra ? this one is aptly called kshama (forgiveness).

 Uma will travel from Bhopal to Ayodhya seeking forgiveness from the electorate that she believed had voted for her in December 2003. Sources close to the sadhvi said Uma would cover more than 1,000 km on foot.

 At the BJP legislature party meeting to elect the chief minister, Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley and Rajnath Singh rejected her demand for a vote. Mahajan cleared his throat, saying the MLAs had been called merely to endorse the parliamentary partys decision to crown Chauhan.

 Uma looked around for support but was greeted with indifferent faces.

 Seconds later, the verdict was out and a seething Uma stormed out. Only 16 MLAs followed her, and they did not include her key associate Anup Mishra, Atal Bihari Vajpayees nephew ? a sharp contrast to the upbeat mood at her residence on October 16 when 106 BJP MLAs had broken bread with her, sealing their support.

 There was more humiliation in store for the sadhvi. Outside the BJP office, someone threw a stone at her. The 100-gram stone may not have hurt her much but it badly bruised her ego. 

 To add salt to her wound, a crowd went into a frenzy, shouting: Andhi hai toofan hai, Shivraj Singh Chauhan hai.

 The darling of the masses a couple of years ago, Uma was now the butt of everyones ridicule.

 Uma arrived in Bhopal this morning overruling her advisers who wanted her to stay on in the BJP. They believed Uma should have accepted the partys offer to be national general secretary and waited for a more appropriate time before hitting back at her detractors. 

 But a report in a Hindi daily is said to have infuriated her so much that Uma decided to sever links with the party at once. The daily claimed that Uma had threatened to commit suicide if she was not made chief minister. 

 The sadhvi held Jaitley responsible for the mischievous act and described the report as baseless, tasteless, derogatory and hateful.

 Words cant describe my sense of hurt, she said.

 If Uma was pelted with stones, her supporters had to fend off lathis outside the state BJP office. 

 Earlier in the day, Chauhans arrival was delayed in Bhopal because of a bomb hoax in the New Delhi-Bhopal Shatabdi Express.

 If Uma is expelled from the BJP, she may float a new party but given her mercurial temperament, not many of her supporters are betting on its success.

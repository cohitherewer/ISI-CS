 Blank space summons 

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Feb. 23: With media being muzzled by the new government headed by King Gyanendra, the Kathmandu chief district officer today summoned representatives of five Nepali-language weeklies and sought to know if they were leaving blank space in their publications to protest against the royal takeover.

 Those summoned included Deshantar Weekly editor and publisher Kabir Rana, Bimarsha Weekly (Red) editor and publisher Rajendra Baidhya, Sanghu Weekly editor Gopal Budhathoki, Prakash Weekly executive editor Navaraj Timilsina and Hank Weekly executive editor Shashidhar Bhandari. Budhathoki is also vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ).

 The journalists presented themselves after the official, Bam Prasad Neupane, directed the crime investigation branch of the district police office and four other ward police stations on February 17 to present them in his office.

 Lawyer and Nepal Bar Association president Shambhu Thapa, who himself had protested against the royal coup, accompanied the journalists.

 Thapa later told reporters that Rana and Baidhya recorded their statements before the assistant chief district officer, and the three others would do so tomorrow. The editors and publishers had assembled at the Nepal Bar Association?s office, on the Supreme Court premises, before heading towards the Kathmandu district administration office.

 The king had issued a proclamation prohibiting the media from criticising his actions for six months. Simultaneously, six journalists, including FNJ general secretary Bishnu Nisthuri, were arrested.

 Last weekend, International Federation of Journalists president Christopher Warren visited Nepal and demanded the release of the six detained journalists and an immediate end to press censorship.

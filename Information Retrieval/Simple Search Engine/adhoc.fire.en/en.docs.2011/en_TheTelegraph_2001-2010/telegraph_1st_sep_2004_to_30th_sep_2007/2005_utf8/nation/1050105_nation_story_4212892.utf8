 Pappu push to jail cell jammer

 R. VENKATARAMAN

New Delhi, Jan. 4: The Supreme Court today 

asked cellphone service providers BSNL and Reliance Infocomm whether and how mobile 

phone connections could be jammed on jail premises throughout the country.

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha sought the replies of the two service providers by January 11 and asked them to identify equipment to jam cellphone calls on prison premises.

 The court?s directive came during a hearing on a petition that challenged a Patna High Court order granting bail to Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav alias Rajesh Ranjan, accused in the murder of trade union leader Ajit Sarkar.

 The apex court had earlier stayed the high court?s order and sent Yadav back to Patna?s Beur jail, from where he is allegedly running his business with all facilities, including cellphones.

 He had even allegedly held a public meeting inside the jail which led to a verbal duel with the jail superintendent. ?There are instances when highly influential persons and powerful personalities have misused mobile phones while lodged in the prison,? Justice Hegde observed. ?It (mobile phone) has to be stopped in all the jails in the country and the process could, to begin with, commence by installing jammers at the central jails,? he added.

 The Court had on December 14 sought the CBI?s view as to where and which prison Yadav should be shifted, either in Bihar or outside, so that he would not be able to violate jail rules. The CBI urged the court that Yadav be shifted to one of the central jails in Poonmallee, Palayamcottai, Vellore and Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu or Mysore in Karnataka or Sabarmati in Gujarat.

 The investigating agency said trial in the six criminal cases pending against Yadav could be shifted to one court and conducted with the help of video-conferencing facility available at the central jails.

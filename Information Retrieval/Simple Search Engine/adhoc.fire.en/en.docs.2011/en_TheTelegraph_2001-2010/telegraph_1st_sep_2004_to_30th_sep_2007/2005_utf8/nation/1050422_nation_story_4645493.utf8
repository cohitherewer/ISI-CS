 ?Silent? Atal in Cong firing line

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, April 21: Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s silence when he was Prime Minister on allegations that George Fernandes was showing special interest in awarding a huge contract to South African weapons manufacturer Denel has prompted the Congress to bring him within the ambit of its attack.

 ?Vajpayee?s silence on the letters (written to him by Priya Ranjan Das Munshi) is intriguing. He should explain the matter,? Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said today.

 The former Prime Minister had acknowledged the first letter from Das Munshi, now the water resources minister and then chief whip of the Congress, but said he was ?passing? it on to the ?raksha mantri, Shri George Fernandes. 

 As there was no response, Das Munshi, who was a member of the defence consultative committee, wrote two more letters to Vajpayee. Copies of the letters were sent to all members of Vajpayee?s Cabinet Committee on Security.

 Sharma?s demand came in response to questions on why his party, despite Das Munshi?s letters, had not raised the issue of the former NDA government?s plans to award the contract for supply of 155mm self-propelled guns to the South African state-owned company.

 The spokesperson said the defence ministry under Fernandes was about to strike the deal, which was much bigger than a deal that he signed for acquiring bunker-busting, anti-materiel rifles that allegedly involved a commission of over 13 per cent. Paying of commissions is illegal in India.

 When treasury bench members raised the issue in the Lok Sabha, Fernandes was present but did not speak. ?George?s boundless guilt is clear from his silence in the House,? he asserted. 

 Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi also joined the treasury bench members in demanding a comprehensive probe into not just the Denel deals but also other defence agreements during the NDA?s tenure. Similar demands were made in the Rajya Sabha. 

 The Congress also asked defence minister Pranab Mukherjee to get in touch with the British government to dig out details of Varas Associates, a firm of agents registered on the Isle of Man. The firm is reported to have received Rs 20 crore from Denel in return for providing the minutes of meetings of the defence ministry?s price negotiating committee. Sharma said the names of the people behind Varas and their ties with NDA leaders should be revealed.

 As the treasury benches stepped up the offensive, the Opposition sought to counter-attack with the Central Vigilance Committee report. In the Lok Sabha, L.K. Advani insisted that along with the Phukan Commission?s report, the government should table the CVC report that dealt with many defence deals struck before the NDA came to power.

 Mukherjee, who avoided making any commitment on tabling the report, countered by asking Advani why the NDA government had refused to hand over the report to the public accounts committee of the last Parliament.

 ?I did not say I will not lay it (the CVC report). What I wanted to know (from the NDA) was that what had prompted them to claim privilege and not provide the document to the public accounts committee of Parliament,? he said.

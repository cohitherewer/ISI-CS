 Sonia solves protocol puzzle

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: Sonia Gandhi has put off next months US trip, solving a protocol problem arising out of her scheduled stay in New York coinciding with that of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The ruling alliance chairperson was to attend a select gathering of world leaders in that city, to be held at former US President Bill Clintons initiative, and discuss some of the planets most pressing challenges.

 The Congress president has postponed her visit to the US, a source said at Sonias 10 Janpath residence. He would not explain the reasons.

 This almost certainly means Sonia would not be attending the September 15-17 meeting despite having accepted Clintons invitation. She was tentatively scheduled to reach New York on September 14 and leave for India on September 18.

 Her latest decision has ended a dilemma agitating the Bush administration, Manmohan Singh himself, external affairs minister Natwar Singh and Indian diplomats in New York and Washington.

 Manmohan Singh is scheduled to be in New York for the annual UN General Assembly session from September 13 to 17. Protocol demands that as Prime Minister, he should receive precedence over Sonia. But being a modest man, Singh would not have liked his presence to overshadow his leaders. 

 The Indian diplomats, too, had been puzzling over how to handle the two VVIPs visits without embarrassing or annoying either.

 Natwar Singh had the same problem: who to spend more time with in America. Less than three months ago, the minister had been criticised for accompanying the Congress president during his four-day visit to Russia.

 The Bush administration, too, has been caught between the protocol requirement of giving precedence to the Prime Minister and the need to diplomatically acknowledge Sonias primacy in Indias ruling alliance.

 US officials were keen to schedule a meeting between President George Bush and Sonia, who would have been on her first trip to America as ruling alliance chief. 

 Bushs meeting with Singh has been tentatively fixed for September 14.

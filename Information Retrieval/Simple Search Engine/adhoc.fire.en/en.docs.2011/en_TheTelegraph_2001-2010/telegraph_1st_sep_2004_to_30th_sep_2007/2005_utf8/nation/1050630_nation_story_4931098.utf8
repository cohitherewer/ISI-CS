 TV tracker grows to capture boom in eyeballs

Growing in numbers

Mumbai, June 29: Powered by the huge upsurge 

in television households ? according to latest data, more than half of Indian 

households may not have basic amenities, but have television ? the entire system 

of measuring the small screen audience is going in for an overhaul.

 Following National Readership Survey (NRS) data, TAM Media Research, the television audience measurement agency almost universally accepted by broadcasters, advertisers and agencies, for the first time has increased the number of sample households to more than double.

 The organisation will, also for the first time, look beyond the current socio-economic categories. Given the ongoing consumerist boom, the advent of new consumer categories and new regions coming into the consumer net, it will constitute two new separate panels to measure the ultra-rich homes and households in rural and semi-urban areas.

 The organisation, which had a sample size of 4,800 peoplemeters in cities and towns with populations of over one lakh, will increase the number of peoplemeters in such towns to 10,300. This follows the NRS report that says from 40 million homes in 2002, cable and satellite television penetration has increased by 53 per cent to 61 million homes in 2005. Cable and satellite television subscription has also penetrated 56 per cent of all television homes in India.

 Television reaches 108 million homes, which means it crosses the 50 per cent mark of all homes for the first time, reflecting a growth of 32 per cent since 2002.

 TAMs expansion is a direct reflection of the changes sweeping over the television universe of the country in particular and the economy in general. Many in the media and advertising industry have been critical of its narrow sample size and have been urging TAM to increase it.

 TAM till last year had maintained the sample size of 4,800 was not inadequate for the Indian audience size as you only need a drop to test the blood of a person. But the expansion became inevitable now and the sample size had to be increased to reflect the changing demographics of the country, says TAM.

 L.V. Krishnan, the chief executive officer of TAM, says: After a thorough analysis of the new universes, the new sample size requirement has come to 10,300 peoplemeters. We have collected feedback from different user groups about segments critical to them and this has also been factored in the new expansion plan.

 He adds that plans to start the panel to measure the absolutely top-end consumers ? elite TAM service ? were on track. The panel ? with its own sample households ? should take shape by the end of this year, he says. 

 The rural and semi-urban household samples ? an area TAM is venturing into for the first time ? will take some more time. For this segment, TAM will look into towns with populations less than a lakh.

 For the elite panel, TAM will first look into households in metros and then move on to non-metros, where also the super-spenders are to be found in large numbers.

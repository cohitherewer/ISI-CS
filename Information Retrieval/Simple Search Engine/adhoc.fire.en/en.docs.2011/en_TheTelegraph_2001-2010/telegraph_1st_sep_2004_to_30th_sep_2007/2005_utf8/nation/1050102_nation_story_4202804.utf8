 Ministers off mikes

 ALOKE TIKKU 

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: Stung by criticism over Kapil Sibal?s public trashing of Thursday?s tsunami alert sounded by the home ministry, the Manmohan Singh government is learnt to have advised ministers to keep off the tragedy briefings. 

 Instead, the government seems inclined to bring to the forefront the faceless bureaucracy that has been working round the clock since the killer waves struck to apprise people of the steps taken by the government. 

 The move was reportedly prompted by a news conference on Thursday where the science and technology minister ran down the tsunami warning from the Australian Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre and the home ministry for issuing an alert on the basis of the warning. 

 Home minister Shivraj Patil, who was apparently reluctant to issue the general warning for fear of creating panic, stood by the decision of his officials on the ground that the alert was issued as a matter of abundant caution to ensure that no further lives were lost.

 Sibal had contended that the warning did not figure in his meeting with Patil earlier in the day and the home ministry acted independently, without consulting his ministry. 

 In fact, the Indian Meteorological Department, which reports to Sibal, had forwarded a message from Isro that referred to the warning and sought necessary ?follow-up action?. 

 Sibal?s meeting with Patil was also attended by T.K.A. Nair, the principal secretary to the Prime Minister, and cabinet secretary B.K. Chaturvedi, which means the PMO was in the know about what happened at the meeting. 

 The spat is being seen in the government as the only embarrassing moment in an otherwise satisfactory handling of the crisis. 

 The home ministry?s national disaster management division had issued an alert on Thursday on the basis of the Met department warning, asking coastal states to be vigilant and keep people off the shores.

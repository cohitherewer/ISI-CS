 Court ire for errant cop duo

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 17: Patna High Court today slapped a contempt of court case on two officers-in-charge of Naugachia police district for granting bail to a Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA who has a non-bailable warrant pending against him.

 Bihpur MLA Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal had been evading arrest for a year in a case related to criminal assault on some policemen of Parbata station.

 Hearing the Indian Medical Association?s PIL today, a division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai summoned state director-general of police Narayan Narayan to explain their in the matter. Mishra told the court that the bail has been cancelled and the accused arrested and sent to judicial custody.

 ?The two police officers of Parbata and Barari (Mandal?s home police station) have been suspended and the superintendent of police directed to begin a probe,? he told the court.

 Bhagalpur deputy inspector-general Kumar Rajesh Chandra said, ?Granting bail to the accused, especially when judicial warrant and attachment of property orders were pending, was a serious mistake. District police officials are looking into it.? 

 During an earlier hearing, the high court had directed the state police to furnish lists of all absconding criminals and arrest them when they turn up to file nomination papers. Subsequently, the police had submitted before the court that over 20,000 criminals are at large in the state. 

 Mandal filed his nomination after his arrest today. Lok Janshakti Party candidate from Shahpur, Dharampal Singh, was arrested on Saturday while he was going to file his nomination.

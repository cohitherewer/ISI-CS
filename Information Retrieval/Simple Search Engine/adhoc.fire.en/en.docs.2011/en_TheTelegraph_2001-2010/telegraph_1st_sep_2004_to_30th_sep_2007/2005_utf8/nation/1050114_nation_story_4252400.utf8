 Apex court to rescue of PSU orphans 

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Coming to the rescue of several thousand employees of public sector undertakings in Bihar and Jharkhand, the Supreme Court today ordered the governments of the two states to deposit Rs 50 crore and Rs 25 crore respectively for disbursement of salaries. 

 ?The total amount of Rs 75 crore collected from the two states shall be deposited with the Justice Udai Sinha Committee within eight weeks of today?s order and disbursed among the employees on a pro-rata basis?, a division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha said in its order. It was hearing a public interest litigation seeking to enforce the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.

 The bench also directed the committee, appointed by the court to look into the matter, to disburse the amount deposited by the two states among 25,000 employees of 19 corporations and ordered Patna High Court to give ?appropriate direction? to speed up the liquidation process for the state-owned companies.

 The court noted that ?five employees? of these PSUs have already died for want of money despite interim orders passed by this court from time to time. It said the amounts disbursed should be duly credited against the names of the employees.

 The court also empowered the committee to determine ?any additional amount? and said the same should be provided by the two states for disbursement among the employees. 

 Advocate Kapila Hingorani, who had filed the PIL, said: ?While the right to freedom of speech and expression and right to trade and commerce could be suspended or even regulated by the government, the right to life is inalienable and no government can suspend it.?

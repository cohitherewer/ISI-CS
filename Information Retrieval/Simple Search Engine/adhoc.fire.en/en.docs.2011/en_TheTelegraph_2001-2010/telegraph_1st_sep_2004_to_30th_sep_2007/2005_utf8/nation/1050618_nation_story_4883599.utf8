 Blast heat on Kanchi seer

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, June 17: Now, the Kanchi acharya is accused of triggering a blast.

 A court has ordered a probe against the Shaivite pontiff for using explosives to tear down a Shiva shrine built inside a Vaishnavite temple.

 Jayendra Saraswatis intention, however, was not iconoclastic: he merely wished to relocate the Shiva linga. The advice for the act, carried out on June 1 last year, allegedly came from leading Kerala astrologer Unnikrishna Panicker.

 The adventure could lead to a sixth case being registered against the seer.

 Krishnamachari, secretary of the Divya Desa Parambariya Padhukappu Peravai, a Vaishnavite forum in Srirangam near Tiruchirappalli, had moved Madras High Court arguing that the acharyas act of shrine demolition ? and its method ? had violated the scriptures and offended Hindus.

 He demanded a probe against the seer and four others, including Panicker and Ramanuja Jeeyar, the pontiff of the 1,300-year-old temple.

 When adherents of religion alter the place of worship and create conditions conducive for public disorder, Justice P.D. Dinakaran said as he disposed of the petition, it is the constitutional obligation of the state to protect the place of worship and preserve public order.

 The judge ordered the state home secretary to direct police to register cases against all five accused and investigate the incident.

 The Shiva shrine directly faced that of Vishnu, the presiding deity of the temple at Thirukkurungudi in Tirunelveli district. Vishnu is worshipped there by the name of Azhagiya Nambiraya Perumal. The blast came during the renovation of the temple by a committee, headed by the Kanchi seer.

 The Shiva shrine was demolished on the pretext of renovation, the petition says. It argues that the act flouted not only the Vaishnavite agamic (scriptures relating to temples, worship and consecration) tenets but also the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act.

 The Kanchi seer has already been cited as an accused in a related case: the alleged assault on the temple priest, Thirukoshtiyur Madhavan, in Chennai last August. Madhavan had openly objected to the demolition of the Shiva shrine.

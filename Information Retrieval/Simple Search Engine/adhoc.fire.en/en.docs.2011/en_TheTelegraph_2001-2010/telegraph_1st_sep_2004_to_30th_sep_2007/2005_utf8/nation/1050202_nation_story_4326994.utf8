 Nepal flight in, rest out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: All flights to and from Nepal were suspended following imposition of emergency by King Gyanendra today.

 Five flights from India were cancelled as the Nepalese authorities sealed the country?s airspace.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said: ?The authorities in Nepal have stopped permitting flights into Kathmandu. We are concerned about the safety and security of Indian passengers and we will resume the flights as soon as we are permitted.?

 The cancelled flights include two of Indian Airlines ? one from Delhi and another from Varanasi ? and one each of Jet Airways, Air Sahara and Royal Nepal Airlines.

 An Air Sahara flight took off from Delhi in the morning but returned after it was not permitted to land in Kathmandu.

 None of the other international carriers that operate regular services to Kathmandu ? Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways, Royal Thai and Pakistan International Airlines ? could enter Nepal?s airspace either.

 Only one flight, of Royal Nepal Airlines, arrived in Delhi and flew back.

 The spokesperson for the International Airports Authority of India said: ?No Kathmandu-bound international flight has been diverted to any airport in India. We do not have any information till now. There was no problem at any of the airports in the country. The Delhi airport is well equipped with necessary infrastructure to manage such an eventuality.?

 A Jet Airways official said the airline did not operate its flight to Kathmandu ?as a precaution? after ?the Indian Airlines flight had to return after being denied permission to land there?. Jet operates one flight a day each way to Nepal.

 ?We will resume our services as and when we are allowed; we have not terminated our services. In case we are unable to operate for longer period, we will try to minimise the inconvenience to our passengers and may waive cancellation charges,? the official added.

 The Indian Airlines spokesperson clarified that no flight is stuck in Nepal. ?But passengers who had booked from Nepal for the morning flight have been stranded. We cannot give the number of passengers stranded since the computer system isn?t showing the details.?

 The Indian Airlines flight was not allowed to land by the air traffic control in Kathmandu. ?Since we could not get the permission to land following the developments, we decided to suspend the two regular flights to Kathmandu till we get the necessary clearance from the authorities,? the spokesperson said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bid to recover eco-systems

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 9: Scientists and wetland experts from 32 countries have urged nations to establish and enforce ?no-construction zones? in vulnerable areas and formulate a sustainable management plan to recover ecosystems.

 Over 400 scientists attending the third Asian Wetlands Symposium here predicted that storm and other extreme weather conditions like tsunami will increase in frequency and intensity in future.

 Representatives of all the Asian countries affected by the recent tsunami took part in the symposium, which ended today.

 The experts admitted that tsunami was an extreme natural phenomenon of relatively low frequency but was a result of climate change.

 Tsunami has created an opportunity to demonstrate best practices in integrated coastal management and to make a paradigm shift from earlier unsustainable practices, they said.

 The AWS called for joint efforts to assess and implement action plans related to the tsunami and coastal wetlands.

 The symposium recommended urgent need for coordinated assessments of stretches of affected coastlines to identify areas where ecological restoration would be most effective.

 President of Wetland International, an environmental advocacy group, Max Finlayson said the scientists discussed the impact of the tsunami to have a better understanding on its environmental aspects.

 ?We need to go for sustainable livelihoods in affected communities linked to wetlands,? he said.

 Chief executive officer of Wetland International Jane Madgwick stressed on protecting the remaining coastal ecosystems and rezoning development. 

 She added urgent action was needed to map remaining coastal ecosystems in the region which are still intact and identify areas for protection and sustainable management.

 The session attended by senior officials of the ministry of environment and forest also favoured community-led approaches for protection and restoration of affected wetlands. According to assessment of the scientists, the main impact of the tsunami on coastal wetlands varied according to the location and distance from the epicentre. 

 The impact includes loss of mangroves and sea grass beds, silting, degradation of coral reefs and sedimentation of coastal water leading to algal blooms.

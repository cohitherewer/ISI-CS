The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

TREMORS

 Mobile identity

Chennai: His cellphone could not save him ? by bringing tidings 

of the quake early ? but it helped identify his body. Krishnamurthy, 35, a resident 

of Bangalore, was killed by the tsunami at Velankanni, a Catholic pilgrim centre. 

His body, along with his mobile, came floating 7 km down the sea to Kameshwaram, 

a fishermen?s village, where it was recovered. Police tried the SIM card in another 

phone and immediately it received a frantic call from actor Rajkumar?s son. He 

had been trying to ascertain his friend?s well-being. Though his family could 

be contacted, Krishnamurthy?s body was badly decomposed and had to be buried at 

Kameshwaram. 

 Lesson saves 

 Phuket: A 10-year-old girl saved her family and 100 other tourists from the tsunami because she had learnt about the giant waves in a geography lesson. Tilly Smith, from Oxshott, Surrey, was holidaying with her parents and seven-year-old sister on Maikhao beach in Phuket when the tide rushed out, reports The Daily Telegraph. As the other tourists watched in amazement, the water began to bubble and the boats on the horizon started to violently bob up and down. Tilly, who had studied tsunamis in a geography class two weeks earlier, quickly realised they were in danger. She told her mother they had to get off the beach immediately and warned that it could be a tsunami. 

 Boys home 

Keezputhupattu (Tamil Nadu) (PTI): Around 20 

boys, missing since the tsunami strike, came home on Saturday giving this small 

fishing hamlet near Pondicherry some reason to cheer. The boys ? all children 

of fishermen ? were last seen playing cricket on the beach. When the waves struck, 

they apparently jumped in the air and were thrown back on the land. The kids ran 

on to the road and took the first bus home.

 Empty graves

 Muvattupuzha (Kerala) (PTI): The parents of two teenagers, who went missing from Velankanni in Tamil Nadu, performed their funeral at their empty graves. The couple clutched their daughters? photographs as the priest performed the last rites. Sherin George,16, and Sofia, 13, had gone to Velankanni on Sunday with relatives. 

 6-hour bridge

Porayar (PTI): Army engineers re-built a bridge in six hours 

to normalise traffic between Karaikal in Pondicherry and Nagapattinam in Tamil 

Nadu. The team from Bangalore constructed the 80-foot-long Bailey bridge using 

ready-to-assemble parts.

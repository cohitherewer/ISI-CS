 Advani finds himself in unlawful assembly

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 The demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992

 New Delhi, July 6: Nearly 13 years after Babri Masjid was pulled down, L.K. Advani is set to be tried in connection with it.

 Allahabad High Court today set aside an order of the Rae Bareli trial court, passed in September 2003, acquitting the BJP president in the case. The high court directed him and the other accused, including former Union ministers Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti, to stand trial.

 The single-judge bench of Justice Y.R. Tripathi said the respondents must appear before the trial court on July 28 to receive further directions.

 It is directed that L.K. Advani, along with the other seven accused, shall also be charged and tried for the offences under Section 149 and Sub-Section (1) of 505 of Indian Penal Code (IPC), Justice Tripathi stated.

 Section 149 stipulates that every member of unlawful assembly (is) guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object.

 With their assembly at the time of the demolition being declared unlawful, things have got tougher for the accused. Now there will be a judicial presumption in favour of their common object with those who had demolished the mosque. The accused have the right to move the Supreme Court against this order.

 Also, the trial will take into account whether Advani and the other respondents issued statements, made speeches and engaged in any other action that could have incited communal violence.

 Under Sub-Section (1) of 505 whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report with intent to incite any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community, shall be punished with imprisonment, which may extend to three years or with fine or with both.

 The high courts verdict came on a criminal revision petition filed by Haji Mehboob and Mohammad Siddique against the order of the Rae Bareli court discharging Advani in September 2003.

 The Rae Bareli court had, however, ordered charges to be framed against the seven other accused: Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar, Ashok Singhal, Acharya Giriraj Kishore, Vishnu Hari Dalmia and Sadhvi Ritambhara. These seven had then moved the high court and obtained an interim stay on their trial. 

 But today, the high court made it clear the interim order shall stand vacated and the case shall be sent forthwith to it (the trial court) with the direction that it speed up the case as already more than 12 years had elapsed (after the demolition).

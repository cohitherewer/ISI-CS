 Governor wades into alert row

 Ayodhya, July 6: The man who once headed the Intelligence Bureau today heightened the embarrassment level of the Uttar Pradesh government ? not as a security expert but as the states first citizen.

 Governor T.V. Rajeswar, who chose to visit the temple town to see what happened in Ayodhya yesterday and how it happened, said the IB had sent intelligence feedback to the state two months back on the possibility of such an attack.

 It was unfair to say there was no alert, he added.

 The comment came a day after state home secretary Aloke Sinha said he had not received any feedback on a possible attack from the IB or any other central agency.

 The governor ? who has been locked in a battle of nerves with the Samajwadi Party regime over several issues ? was supposed to go to Delhi today. This morning, he changed his plan and decided to visit Ayodhya.

 The governor reached Ayodhya at 10.30 and the disputed area 10 minutes later.

 During his visit, he did not offer any puja. He went on asking senior officers, including the director-general of police, who were accompanying him about yesterdays incident, said Satyendra Das, the chief priest of the makeshift Ram temple.

 The governor then drove straight to the Circuit House where he talked to reporters, much to the dismay of local Samajwadi leaders.

 I have come to see what happened yesterday and how it happened, Rajeswar said. I am grateful to the jawans who fought valiantly to defeat their mission.

 The comment on the IB alert came soon after.

 While senior officials of the home department squirmed in discomfort, state police chief Yashpal Singh said he would not indulge in petty politics but added: We indeed had no specific intelligence feedback.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who visited Ayodhya during the day, explained that specifics are not outlined in an intelligence feedback, only general alerts are sent. But I am not supposed to give you details of the note sent to the state government, he said.

 Patil said he had no complaints about the way security forces handled the situation yesterday. Even if you have intelligence alert, there is bound to be some element of surprise in any militant attack, he added.

 BJP ally George Fernandes, who visited the temple complex in the afternoon, said he did not agree with the demand for the state governments dismissal. It (attack) can happen anywhere. I dont agree with the BJP at all, the NDA convener said.

 The statewide bandh called by the BJP did not evoke much of a response. Shops remained closed in the temple town but that was because it was the weekly off day for markets.

 The bandh did not deter pilgrims either. During yesterdays attack, at least 50 pilgrims who got trapped inside the temple were asked to crawl out. This morning, there were pilgrims waiting to enter, said a security officer at the temple.

 Delhi prods Nepal

 Kathmandu, July 23: Junior foreign minister Rao Indrajit Singh wound up his Nepal visit today by asserting that Delhi wanted immediate restoration of multi-party democracy and constitutional monarchy in the kingdom, reports our correspondent.

 Singh said India was extremely concerned over the turn of events in Nepal beginning with the February 1 royal takeover. India merely wants to see multi-party democracy and constitutional monarchy institutionalised in Nepal, he said.

 Singh arrived in Kathmandu on Thursday to mobilise Nepals support for Indias bid for a permanent seat in the UN. 

 During his stay, Singh met, among others, King Gyanendra, foreign minister Rameshnath Pandey and some prominent politicians including Nepali Congress supremo Girija Prasad Koirala and CPN (UML) general secretary Madhav Nepal separately and discussed the current political situation. He also met cabinet vice-chairmen Dr Tulsi Giri and Kirti Nidhi Bista.

 Emerging out of the meeting with the Nepali Congress leader at his Maharajganj residence, Singh said: The main issue of concern is how to set up (a) democratic process in Nepal. I took it up with His Majesty also.

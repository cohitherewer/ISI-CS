New Delhi, July 14: If you are a golfer and have the urge to splurge, Danish major Ecco has brought out one of the costliest golf shoes in this part of the world with a price tag of Rs 26,999. 

 Not that these are the costliest shoes in the country. Louis Vuitton, the designer brand, already retails high-end footwear that costs between Rs 20,000 and a whopping Rs 2.5 lakh. But these are shoes for the men and women who rank among the countrys super spenders.

 Relatively less costly fashion statements come from Aigner, a brand of casuals which retails for Rs 35,000-40,000, and Mango, which sells for Rs 15,000-20,000.

 The Danish footwear major, which is the latest entrant into this exclusive market for the rich and famous, is also offering its range of casual and formal footwear besides golf shoes.

 The formal range mainly consists of office wear for men and costs anywhere between Rs 8,299 and Rs 12,000. The casual range is priced between Rs 7,349 and Rs 12,000. The golf range for men and women costs between Rs 10,300 and Rs 26,999 and Rs 6,399 and Rs 10,299, respectively.

 Initially, Ecco shoes will be available in three cities ? Delhi, Mumbai and Chandigarh. The company plans to go to Bangalore and Hyderabad in its second year of operation. The shoes will be available in Calcutta and Chennai in the third year, said Sumit K. Lal, director, Ecco Shoes.

 The company, which sells approximately 12 million pairs across the world every year, has a modest local sale target: 15,000 pairs imported from Denmark. It hopes to break even before the end of the third year here.

 Ecco says it will spend Rs 1 crore on promotion and marketing expenses in India.

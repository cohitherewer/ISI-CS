 Delhi air and rail links fogged out

 New Delhi (PTI): Thick fog engulfed the 

 capital on Sunday morning, throwing normal life out of gear 

 and sending air, rail and road traffic haywire for the third 

 consecutive day.

 Dense fog enveloped the Palam area, where the airport is located, reducing runway visibility range to less than 50 metres since late Saturday night, airport sources said.

 No domestic flights could take off or land at the Indira Gandhi international airport since 10.00 pm on Saturday. 

 Actors Gulshan Grover, Esha Deol and Zayed Khan were among hundreds of passengers stranded at the airport here. The foggy conditions also did not allow Union home minister Shivraj Patil and Union minister for personnel Suresh Pachouri to return to the capital.

 Operations resumed at 9.50 am on Sunday after the weather cleared up. Several private airlines had already announced suspension of operations. Over 40 flights operating from Delhi have been affected while several international flights have been diverted.

 Trains, especially from the northern parts were running late, railway sources said.

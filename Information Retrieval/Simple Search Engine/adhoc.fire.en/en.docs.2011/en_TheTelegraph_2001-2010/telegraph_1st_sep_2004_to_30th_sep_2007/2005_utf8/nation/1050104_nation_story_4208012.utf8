 Soft drink notice to Centre

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 3: The Supreme Court today issued a notice to the central government on a public interest litigation contending that ?contents of soft drinks? were not being regulated by the government.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur issued the notice on a petition by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation seeking a direction to the Centre to ?regulate and control the contents of soft drinks? promoted through advertisements, ?concealing the health hazards?.

 The petitioner quoted various studies conducted all over the world, which have found that some contents of soft drinks are harmful to human beings. 

 ?It was the duty of the central government to protect its citizens from health hazards and hence it should take measures to conduct in-depth study into the contents of soft drinks and tell the public about their harmful effects,? the petition contended.

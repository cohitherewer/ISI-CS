 Mutt land in Left glare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Aug. 21: The CPM in Tamil Nadu wants excess land in the hands of various religious mutts to be transferred to landless farm labourers.

 The Land Ceiling Act should be amended to enable transfer of some 20 lakh acres of surplus land, being held by big landlords, corporate houses and mutts, to the landless labour, CPM state secretary N. Varadarajan said after a meeting of the partys state executive.

 Opposing the Jayalalithaa governments move to lease out 50 lakh acres of wasteland to corporate houses as part of an initiative to develop it, Varadarajan said the land given to Dalits under British rule and subsequently encroached upon by upper castes should be handed back to the Dalits.

 With the CPMs central committee having identified land, food security and employment opportunities as the main themes for a nationwide campaign from mid-August to September-end, the land issue will be highlighted in Tamil Nadu. 

 The campaign will culminate in a picketing of state and central government offices on September 13, he said. 

 The Centre allocated Rs 60 crore this year for the food-for-work programme in four districts of Tamil Nadu, including the tsunami-hit Nagapattinam and Cuddalore district.

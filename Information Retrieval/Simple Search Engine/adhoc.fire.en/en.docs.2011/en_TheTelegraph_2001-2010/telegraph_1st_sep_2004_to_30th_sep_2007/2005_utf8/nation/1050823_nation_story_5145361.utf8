 New Delhi, Aug. 22: The jinx is at work again: for the umpteenth time, the womens bill has been pushed on to the backburner.

 Two weeks after stirring hopes that the proposal to reserve 33 per cent seats in Parliament and legislatures for women would be on the monsoon sessions agenda, the government is back to square one.

 A meeting of UPA constituents convened by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to thrash out a consensus on the womens bill ended without agreement today.

 Two hours were spent articulating and debating views on the bill that has been on the agenda of successive governments since 1996. But at the end of it, Singh could only say: I have taken note of the views expressed here.

 Congress spokesman Anand Sharma said there was no possibility of the government coming up with a new bill this session as there was no consensus among leaders.

 Consensus is a must for legislation on the issue, he said. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, who attended the meeting, apparently did not voice her views during the discussion.

 At the end of the day, the Congress, Left parties, Nationalist Congress Party, Lok Janshakti Party and DMK favoured the quota proposal.

 Allies Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the PMK pitched for a quota within the quota. They said there should be a further 33 per cent quota for scheduled castes/tribes, OBCs and Muslims within the 33 per cent quota for women.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil touched on the proposal to raise the number of seats in Parliament so that women could get their 33 per cent quota without the men having to forego their share.

 Left leaders, who had made known their preference for the original proposal, said they could consider the quota within quota for the sake of a consensus. But other leaders did not refer to it.

 We have left it to the government as to which form it wants to bring in the bill, CPM politburo member Brinda Karat said.

 Brinda had jogged the governments memory about its commitment to the womens bill. CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechury and Basudev Acharya also attended the meet.

 Both RJD boss Laloo Prasad Yadav and Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav ? invited to the talks despite supporting the government from outside ? insisted they would rather settle for 10-15 per cent reservation if the sub-quota proposal was not acceptable. Mayavati plugged the same line.

 Mulayam Singh also suggested there should be quotas for tickets also, which should be enforced by the Election Commission.

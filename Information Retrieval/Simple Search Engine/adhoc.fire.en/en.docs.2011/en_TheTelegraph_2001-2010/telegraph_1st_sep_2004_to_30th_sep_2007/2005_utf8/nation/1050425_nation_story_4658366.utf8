 New Delhi, April 24: The fifth day of the Lakme India Fashion Week 2005 was marked by a dazzling debut by a veteran duo, some comic creativity from a style stalwart and the hint of a plagiarism controversy without which the fashion week is usually incomplete.

 Gossip first: pamphlets claiming ?Manish Arora?s collection is a rip-off of designer Alexander McQueen?s Spring-summer 2005 collection?? were found lying all over the media centre in the morning.

 The Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) was quick to stash away the papers carefully, but they couldn?t escape media attention. The designer rubbished the claim, saying: ?I don?t need to copy anyone, I have too many ideas inside my head?.?

 Controversy apart, the rest of the day saw some brilliant diffusion lines on the ramp. Ace designers Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, after having given the fashion week the miss for the last five years, decided to debut in real style. 

 The duo wove their trademark white magic at a show that saw the most glamorous front-row presence so far ? Dimple Kapadia, Jaya Bachchan, Sonali Bendre and Shweta Nanda were seen cheering the designers.

 Dreamy, free-flowing silhouettes in white and shades of white created an almost ethereal look with femininity strongly in focus.

 Long, flowing coats and robes, floor-length sherwanis and kurtas and small cholis teamed with skirts with inbuilt sari drapes were the highlights.

 Sheer fabrics like chamois satin, georgettes and organza shaped the clean cuts, as tone-on-tone chikan kari, resham, beads, mosaic patterns and appliqu?s embellished the ensembles.

 In sync with the name of the collection ? Lotus Pond ? huge fabric flowers adorned the clothes, as did reams and reams of ribbons. Gothic designs in silver jewellery by Niharika Khan accessorised the clothes.

 ?This is totally a concept collection, based only on our inspiration. We didn?t keep the buyers or the commercial angle in mind. But these are all wearable clothes and should be appreciated in the international market,? said Khosla.

 Praises like ?no one can beat these guys? and ?the clothes are to die for? kept flowing aplenty from the crowd even as Kapadia, a regular Abu Sandeep wearer, loved the clothes and felt ?white is always in?.

 The other big draw of the day ? JJ Valaya ? lived up to every bit of the expectations of the packed house. A tribute to Georges Remi, popularly known as Herge, the creator of the world?s most prolific comic character Tintin, the collection was broken up into three sequences ? Prisoners of the Sun, Bashi Bazouk and Tintin in Tibet.

 ?I have grown up reading Tintin and it has been an integral part of my life. But sadly, the popularity of Tintin has always overshadowed Herge and so my collection is a tribute to the creator more than the character. I have been inspired by the kind of palettes and detailing Herge used in his comic books. The collection starts from Peru, travels to the Ottoman empire and culminates in Tibet,? explained Valaya.

 The show opened with a collection in black and ivory with Inca motifs on woven fabrics, mostly linen and lycra, accentuated with crystal embroidery and beads. It moved on to a line with lots of prints, layering, surface treatments and texturisation in lycra, velvet, voile and georgette.

 Coats, corsets, skirts and drapes in raw silk borrowed Tibetan palette and prints and combined them with contemporary styling in the last sequence.

 Kids with Tintin hairdos were seen running all over the ramp even as the catwalkers kept pirouetting.

 The start of the day was dedicated to two designer duos from Calcutta ? Mona Lamba and Pali Sachdev and Lalit and Sunita Jalan.

 The Jalans unveiled a rather ordinary line of clothes with quite a lofty inspiration behind it. The ?obscured human psyche? was the idea that shaped their modest collection comprising trousers, shirts, kurtis, jackets and sherwanis for men and capris, skirts, tops and kurtas for women in white and aqua colours.

 Monapali put up a commendable show, deviating from their conventional brief to unveil a fresh new style. Heavily embellished and textured fabrics shaped the lehngas, skirts, churi pants, kurtas, kaftans and ponchos while the saris came with a lot of innovation on the pallus. Lots of layering formed the free-flowing garments with the basket-weaving technique ? using fibre, thick thread and wool ? being the mainstay of the embellishments.

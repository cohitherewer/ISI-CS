 Woman claims crown of ?saviour of 100? 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Nagapattinam, Jan. 7: An alert woman, a television 

set and a spirit of social service ? the three together made for a life-saving 

combination in Tamil Nadu?s worst-hit district.

 Manimegalai, president of the Poompuhar village panchayat in Nagapattinam district, claims to have ?saved over 100 lives? with her presence of mind.

 On December 26 around 8.15 am, the 50-year-old woman noticed two unusual occurrences.

 She saw the water in her well ?bubbling? when she went to fetch a pail of water and, shortly after, observed ?wave-like formations? in the local pond.

 Manimegalai said she immediately alerted the local police.

 Then she rushed to her television set and switched it on, only to notice the scrolling news on the screen about tremors that were felt in Chennai early that day ? the first ones around 6.33 am.

 Some regional television channels were already flashing the news of water entering several houses in the Tamil Nadu capital. 

 The first of the waves had crashed on the Chennai coast between 7.30 am and 7.45 am and the Marina beach was flooded.

 Manimegalai said that she sensed something was seriously amiss. She then ran out of her house and started shouting, asking the people of the village to immediately move to safer ground. 

 She then rushed to the Poompuhar beach to pull out some children playing there.

 By the time the tsunami hit Poompuhar and other coastal villages of Nagapattinam after 9 am, Manimegalai had that little lead-time to forewarn the people. This, she claimed, helped her ?to save more than 100 lives?.

 Poompuhar village panchayat reported 123 deaths, but Manimegalai says the toll could have been considerably higher if not for her ?warning that day?.

 The news of her saving act, in what is called the ?golden hour? of a crisis, came to light 12 days after disaster struck the tourist spot of Poompuhar. Washed by the Bay of Bengal, it is an ancient port of the early Chola dynasty and was once a flourishing commercial hub.

 Manimegalai belongs to the fisherfolk community and had won a National Award in the category of ?Best Panchayat President? in 1998.

 Her saviour act notwithstanding, the toll in the tsunami disaster is poised to climb much higher in Nagapattinam district.

 This evening, collector Veera Shanmugha Mony put the toll at 6,036 people, which includes 1,875 men and 2,400 women; the rest are children.

 This number, however, could go up, with the district officials declaring that 1,626 people are reported missing till this evening.

 Velankanni, a pilgrimage centre about 10 km from Nagapattinam town, alone has reported ?943 missing persons?, the district collector said.

 The final toll in Nagapattinam district could cross 7,660 since in a natural calamity of this scale, the missing persons are ?presumed dead? if they are not traced in a week?s time, according to government norms.

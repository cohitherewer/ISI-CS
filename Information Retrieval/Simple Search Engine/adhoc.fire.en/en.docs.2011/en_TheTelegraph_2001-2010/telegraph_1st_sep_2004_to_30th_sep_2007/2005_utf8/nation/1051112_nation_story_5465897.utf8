 BA eye on India sky

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 shifting focus?

 London, Nov. 11: British Airways is focused on controlling the Indian skies, even if it means taking a flight out of the Washington network and re-routing it to India.

 It is Indias year in world aviation, goes the official slogan adopted by the airline.

 We are all focused on India and have already emerged as the clear leader in flying (the) most number of flights out of India to the UK and also provide better connectivity to non-UK destinations from Heathrow. The importance of India to us can be gauged from our commitment to improve and increase services to India even if that means re-routing them from other sectors and pressing them into service for India. The entire world is waiting for India to grow further and we are proud to be part of it, Robbie Baird, regional director (Africa, West, Central and South Asia) told The Telegraph in London.

 It is not just a huge increase in passenger flow but even Indian cuisine has been a big hit around the world. We have introduced Indian food in the US sectors as well and it is a big success story ? especially items like the prawn masala, said Andy Sparrow, the menu development manager in charge of food and beverage.

 With Indias international aviation market estimated at a whopping Rs 15,000 crore ? the third-biggest after the US and Europe, according to the figures from the International Air Transport Association ? British Airways is looking at increasing seat capacity by 75 per cent in the country by early 2006.

 There has been a 67 per cent increase this year already and operating profits have been very good, with all our flights going full. We are looking at a major expansion shortly, a spokesperson for British Airways said at the Waterside head office of the airline in London.

 The airline flies to five cities ? Delhi (seven a week), Mumbai (14), Calcutta (three), Bangalore (five) and Chennai (six) ? but it is discussing the possibility of connecting other destinations like Hyderabad in the near future.

 We are always reviewing the situation and even Calcutta, which has seen the third flight addition (in June 2005), has been providing us with a very good business, said Alok Sawhney, country commercial manager (India). We will review the situation next winter and then decide on any further expansion, he added, when asked if the city will get a fourth flight soon.

 British Airways is also organising and supporting events like golf tournaments to promote itself. A golf tournament at Tollygunge Golf Club from November 26 is on the cards, with the winner to be flown to play at the Ryder Cup venue. We are taking up many such events to popularise the high-quality services of British Airways and Calcutta has a great potential, said a spokesman.

 With an increase from 19 flights early this year to 35 by October, there is no looking back for the airline which has emerged as the global leader with operating profits at ?437 million this year till now. Rising from the bottom of the pit (ranked 21st) in the world in 1996 to becoming the leader has a lot to do with our business focus on prime profitable routes like India. Everything ? from passenger flow (11,000-plus a week) to the food ? has been a big hit for us, said Baird, on the eve of the official inauguration of the London-Bangalore sector of the airlines network in India.

 A new terminal ? Terminal Five ? is coming up at Heathrow, where only British Airways flights will park and take off by 2008. The airline has also adopted a 12-point agenda to improve its performance and the focus is now to clear as many flights as possible out of Heathrow and provide better connectivity to other destinations. A large number of passengers come to visit Britain but we are also committed to provide quality services to those who are keen on better connectivity. We are giving the people of India a reason to cheer, a spokesperson said.

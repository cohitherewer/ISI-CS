 Left set for power battle

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: After FDI in telecom and banking, the Left parties are taking on the government over the new electricity policy.

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan shot off a terse letter to Union power minister P.M. Sayeed on Saturday, expressing displeasure over the announcement of a new electricity policy based on the contentious 2003 electricity act. The act was passed by the NDA regime.

 ?The Centre has announced its new electricity policy on the basis of this act. This means you are not interested in its review,? Bardhan said in his letter.

 The Left is demanding a review of the 2003 act and the common minimum programme assures such a review. The Centre, however, has gone ahead and announced a new policy whose provisions are based on the electricity act which allows private players to take over different branches of the electricity sector ? generation, transmission and distribution.

 In his letter, Bardhan accused Sayeed of not following up his first meeting with the Left with a second meeting as promised. ?We expected that after your return from Haj, you will fix a second meeting. But no such meeting has been held.?

 Bardhan had earlier submitted a note to the UPA government outlining the Left?s reservations on the electricity act. He had also discussed the issue with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The government has so far not shown any interest ? barring one occasion ? to engage the Left in a serious review of the electricity act. The Left is now going to submit a second detailed note about its reservations.

 ?It seems the government has no intentions of discussing the issue with employees? and engineers? organisations. In that case, the government should intimate us,? Bardhan said.

 He suggested that the Centre was being partial to independent producers and industrialists. ?The government finds the time to discuss with independent producers, industrialists? organisations and chambers of commerce?. It seems you are prepared to drive workers and engineers to the path of agitation and struggle.?

 The Left is vehemently opposed to a policy of unbundling state electricity boards. It wants the government to continue to subsidise electricity for poor households and to distribute power at an affordable rate to all sections, particularly farmers.

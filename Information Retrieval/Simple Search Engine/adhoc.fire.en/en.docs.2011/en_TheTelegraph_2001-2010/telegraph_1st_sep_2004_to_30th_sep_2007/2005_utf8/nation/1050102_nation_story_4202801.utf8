 Singh lines up tragedy meeting 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to convene an all-party meeting early next week to discuss the devastation caused by the tsunami and the relief and rehabilitation operations in the affected areas.

 Congress sources said Singh would have convened a meeting immediately after last Sunday?s tragedy but for the BJP?s attempt to play politics. 

 While former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and BJP president L.K. Advani have taken the stand that the issue should not be politicised, the party is using other leaders to attack the government. 

 Yesterday, party general secretary Sushma Swaraj assailed the government for a ?false warning creating panic among people?, referring to Thursday?s tsunami warning. 

 Today, V.K. Malhotra, the BJP?s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, criticised the Centre. 

 ?Many questions will arise but this is not the proper time for discussing such issues,? Malhotra said after jointly flagging off trucks carrying relief material with Sushma. 

 ?The government will also have to answer for the delay in flashing a warning about the tsunamis in coastal areas last Sunday even though the tidal waves hit India two hours after the giant quake off the Indonesia coast,? he said. 

 In contrast, Vajpayee and Advani discussed the situation with Singh yesterday and said it was not the time for criticism but united action. 

 Asked if he raised the issue of the alert, Advani told reporters: ?This is not the time for it. We are together. There is a remarkable unity in dealing with the calamity and united response would continue.? 

 Later, PMO spokesperson Sanjaya Baru said both the Prime Minister and the Opposition leaders were of the shared view that it was a national calamity and ?together we should face it?. 

 Advani said Vajpayee suggested the government should implement the recommendations of the national committee on disaster management set up by his government.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister Shivraj Patil were present at the meeting last night.

 Bowout stirs culture clash

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 23: A ?detoxification? drive continued to rock the Sangeet Natak Akademi today with theatre personality Kavalam Narayana Panicker resigning as vice-chairman of the official culture guardian.

 Panicker?s walkout is the latest in a series of shows of protest against Akademi chairperson Sonal Mansingh. Several of the country?s top performing artistes have been up in arms against the ?autocratic administration? and ?saffron leanings? of the danseuse.

 Panicker, who along with two of the five other government nominees had announced their resignation earlier, met culture minister Jaipal Reddy tonight and submitted his papers.

 The move came a few hours after the executive committee of the Akademi met and unanimously passed a resolution urging Carnatic musician Balamuralikrishna to withdraw his resignation. The musician had resigned to protest the continuation of Mansingh as chairperson.

 A copy of Panicker?s resignation letter has been faxed to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 ?I had earlier given a representation regarding the unethical and unconstitutional way of functioning in the Sangeet Natak Akademi. So my conscience does not allow me to continue as vice-chairman after making a representation to the honourable President of India,? he wrote in the letter.

 The marathon seven-hour meeting had been called to pass the Sangeet Natak Akademi awards, which are to be announced next week.

 ?Today?s meeting was quite relaxed. We have not discussed any of the issues regarding differences and this is not the forum to raise those issues. It is not a personal vendetta against anyone. Differences are still there and we will raise it at an appropriate forum,? Panicker has said before meeting Reddy.

 Mansingh, who had lent support to the NDA?s India Shining campaign, described the meeting as ?interesting, happy and important?.

 ?I have no differences with anyone and I am ready to cooperate with everyone for the common cause of the institution we represent,? she said. A nominee pointed out that ?when all members are supporting the resolution, she has to give her approval?.

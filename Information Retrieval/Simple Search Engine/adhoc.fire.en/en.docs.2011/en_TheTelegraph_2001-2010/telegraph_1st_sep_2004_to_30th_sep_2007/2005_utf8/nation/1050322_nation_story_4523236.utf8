 New Delhi, March 21: Rahul 

 and Sonia Gandhi took the Lok Sabha by surprise today.

 First-time MP Rahul, who had been a passive onlooker in Parliament for 10 months, broke his silence today, while the Congress president sat in the back row of the treasury benches, three rows behind her son.

 Rahul, the most ?prominent? among the young Turks in the Congress, chose to speak on the plight of sugarcane growers in Uttar Pradesh and in the bargain point a finger at the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government in the state.

 The Uttar Pradesh government, the Congress MP said, should respect the Supreme Court?s directive to pay the arrears due to sugarcane growers. 

 Rahul claimed that the state government had told the Supreme Court that private sugar mill owners did not owe the growers any money. 

 However, Rahul said the submission did not reflect the ground situation. The cane commissioner, he pointed out, had told a TV channel that arrears of Rs 517 crore are pending.

 As head of the National Advisory Council, Sonia holds cabinet rank and the seat allotted to her is next to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the leader of the House, Pranab Mukherjee. 

 Her party?s leaders, who are used to hierarchy, were mildly flustered when she chose to sit at the back. 

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram even asked her to take her usual place. But Sonia decided to be a backbencher and read documents. She stopped reading when Rahul started to speak and followed every word. When the speech ended, she thumped the table along with other treasury bench members.

 Speaker Somnath Chatterjee congratulated Rahul on his maiden speech. The scion of the Nehru family has taken much longer than some of his first-time colleagues to make his maiden intervention. Sachin Pilot and Milind Deora have participated in debates on development and agriculture.

 It was only natural that Rahul targeted the Samajwadi Party in his first speech, considering that he had gone hammer and tongs after Mulayam Singh soon after entering Parliament. 

 The Congress MP had said during a visit to Uttar Pradesh that the Mulayam Singh government had as yet done nothing for the state.

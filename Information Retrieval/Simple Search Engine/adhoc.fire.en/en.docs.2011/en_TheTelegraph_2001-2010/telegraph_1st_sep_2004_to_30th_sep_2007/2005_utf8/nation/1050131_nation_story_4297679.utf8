 Poll birds, wives in Magadh battle

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Jan. 30: The coming Assembly elections in Bihar will see political ?migratory birds? and their wives trying their luck from different constituencies in the Magadh region.

 Jay Kumar Palit, the stormy petrel of the Congress legislature party in the Eighties, has a history of party-hopping. From the Congress, Palit jumped on to the RJD bandwagon. Laloo Prasad Yadav?s party rewarded him with a ticket in the 2000 Assembly elections. But the lantern failed to bring any light in his political career and Palit finished a poor third.

 Done with the RJD?s secularism, Palit decided to join the BJP, which, however, did not give him a ticket. Palit then returned home (Congress) ? more as an unwanted stranger than a lost family member ? and he had to contend with the hostile campaign led by Md Moosa.

 Though Palit lobbied hard for a ticket either for himself or his wife Renuka Palit, a municipal councillor, the Congress did not oblige him. Renuka eventually filed her papers as a Samajwadi Party candidate from the Gaya Town seat.

 Veteran politician Nagmani, another renowned party-hopper, started his career in the Soshit Samaj Dal, one of the splinter groups of the Socialist Party, Nagmani subsequently joined the Congress. From there, he switched to the Janata Dal and has been in all branches of the extra-large ?Dal parivar?.

 Towards the closing stages of the NDA rule at the Centre, Nagmani joined the BJP and was rewarded with a ministerial berth. After the NDA lost power, the veteran politician, according to activist A.M Karimi, ?rediscovered the virtues of secularism? and joined hands with Paswan. 

 Now, Nagmani?s wife Suchitra Singh is the official LJP nominee from the Kurtha Assembly constituency in Jehanabad district.

 Ramashray Prasad Singh, the permanent occupant of the number two slot in almost all Congress governments in the state in the Seventies and Eighties, joined Ram Vilas Paswan?s party after he failed to get a ticket for the Warisaliganj Assembly seat in Nawada district. 

 Singh was apparently denied a ticket for forfeiting his security deposits as Congress candidate from the Konch Assembly constituency in Gaya district. He is now the LJP?s candidate from the Makhdumpur constituency in Jehanabad district.

 Though this is for the first time that Singh has changed his political affiliation, he has been a known constituency-hopper and contested elections from no less than four Assembly seats spread over as many districts.

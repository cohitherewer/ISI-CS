 Neighbours meet to take stock of talks 

 PRANAY SHARMA 

 Islamabad, Aug. 31: India and Pakistan begin a crucial round of talks tomorrow to decide whether the current negotiations should continue or if there is a need to think about a new format.

 In its current form the composite dialogue, which has gone on for more than a year and will complete its second round tomorrow morning, covers eight issues, including Jammu and Kashmir over which the two sides differ seriously.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran, who meets his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Mohammed Khan to take stock of how the talks have progressed, has made it clear that India is satisfied with the dialogue process. 

 Saran feels the talks have made a slow ? and in some ways ? interesting progress.

 But Pakistan is not too happy with the pace at which the talks are moving. 

 It feels the slow progress will allow disappointment to set in and ultimately may have an adverse effect on the peace process that has remained on track for over two years.

 This, however, does not mean that Pakistan will break away from the talks, though it might insist that the two sides look for a different format to push forward issues that have dogged relations between the neighbours for years.

 When President Pervez Musharraf met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi this April, the two sides, among other things, spoke about reviving the joint commission, whose last meeting was in the late 1980s.

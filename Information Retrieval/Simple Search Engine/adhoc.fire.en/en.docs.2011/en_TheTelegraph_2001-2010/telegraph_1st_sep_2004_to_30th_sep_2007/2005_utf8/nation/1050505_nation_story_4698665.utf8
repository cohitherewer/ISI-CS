 BJP gifts Kanchi respite to Jaya

 M.R.VENKATESH

 Kancheepuram, May 4: With former ally BJP keeping out of the Kancheepuram and Gummidipoondi Assembly bypolls, Jayalalithaa may not have got a walkover, but she has definitely won the toss. 

 The BJP move has allowed her to push to the background an issue that could have proved prickly: the Kanchi seer?s arrest.

 The BJP had been the only party to have made an issue of the pontiff?s arrest as well as the ?manner in which Jayendra Saraswati was treated subsequently? by the ADMK government. But the party has chosen to skip both the byelections on May 14 to focus on the 2006 Assembly polls, which it plans to fight on its own.

 With all other major parties having applauded the chief minister?s ?bold act? of arresting the seer, there have been no tricky questions for Jayalalithaa to answer during the campaign. 

 On her part, Jayalalithaa isn?t even mentioning the subject as she travels from village to village, canvassing votes for Mythili Thirunavukkarasu. 

 ?People here by and large do not see the seer?s arrest as a political issue,? admits Kumar, a functionary of the Opposition PMK in Kancheepuram. ?Jayendra Saraswati?s arrest is not an issue among the public now,? agrees a shopkeeper at Baluchetti Chatram village.

 Even Jayalalithaa?s choice of venue to launch her campaign last evening seemed designed to underscore this point. She held her rally not near the mutt founded by Adi Sankara, but close to a mosque at Oli Mohammed Pettai on the fringes of the temple town.

 With the ecclesiastical issue pushed to the sidelines, Jayalalithaa is harping on more mundane subjects. At every meeting, she reminds the audience that the ?only achievement? of the UPA government at the Centre ? of which the DMK and other Opposition parties in the state are a part ? was hiking the prices of petrol and diesel thrice. ?Yet, my government has not raised the bus fares,? she signs off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Freedom fighter soldiers on, for women 

 After battling the British, more-than-a-century-old 

 Ram Bachan Singh is inching towards realising another dream: 

 building a college, exclusively for girls, in his small Uttar 

 Pradesh village

 As a young man, Ram Bachan Singh 

 had fought the British. Now 103, he is still fighting ? 

 for a freedom of a different kind.

 A freedom that would give girls 

 of his village a chance to stand on their own feet.

 In the rural hinterland of eastern 

 Uttar Pradesh, where the redeeming touch of education has 

 reached few women, Ram Bachan has vowed not to rest till 

 he builds a college only for them.

 It is a dream he has nursed for 

 long and age has not dulled his zeal.

 I want to see the daughters 

 of my area attending a college. There is not a single womens 

 college within 10 kilometres of the village, he says.

 Recently, he stepped closer to 

 his goal when the Supreme Court directed the state government 

 to build a girls college near Pijra, where the former 

 freedom fighter is considered a god.

 We hope that all requisite 

 steps will be taken for construction of (the) college building 

 without any delay. Attempts should be made that the building 

 comes up and (the) college starts functioning during his 

 lifetime, a bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and B.N. 

 Srikrishna had said.

 The order brought a hint of a 

 smile through the flowing white beard, much like that of 

 Tagore. It could make a world of difference to the women 

 of Pijra and adjoining Bagli where 80 per cent of the women 

 are illiterate and only 7 or 8 per cent have been lucky 

 to have made it to college.

 Will he throw a party now that 

 the countrys highest court has ruled in his favour?

 Pat came the answer. My 

 party will be to see the smile on the faces of women here.

 The victory has been late in coming.

 The state government had opposed 

 Singh from the day he began knocking on the doors that could 

 open the road to enlightenment. The authorities cited financial 

 reasons and even went to the extent of saying there was 

 no need for a college as Mau district already had 13 where 

 women could enrol.

 The government filed a petition 

 in the high court. After it was dismissed, the government 

 filed a special leave petition in the apex court.

 But Ram Bachan would not give 

 up despite being forced to leave the Supreme Court once 

 for not having a professional pleader. He did get a lawyer 

 when the court requested Pravin Parikh, the president of 

 the Supreme Court bar association, to help him.

 Justice came soon after. On Parikhs 

 submission, the court said there was no illegality 

 in the high courts directive and observed that it 

 was astonished at the state governments attitude.

 Even after the court order, nothing 

 has moved. Parikh spoke to chief minister Mulayam Singh 

 Yadav, who promised to honour the freedom fighters 

 wish. But district magistrate H.M. Yadav said he had not 

 yet received a copy of the order.

 It means more running around but 

 Ram Bachan is prepared to soldier on. His wife knows that, 

 too. If he has to, he will walk miles to meet the 

 people he wants to, says 85-year-old Ram Pyari.

 Ram Bachan has donated 19 acres 

 for building the college and Rs 10 lakh for a scholarship 

 to deserving students. His only condition is that the college 

 be named after him.

 His fellow villagers are unlikely 

 to grudge him his little request. 

 Ram Bachan Singh has gifted 

 us roads, a hospital and now he is giving us this college. 

 He does not dance like clownish politicians before cameras, 

 he is our god, says Ram Ashish Singh.

 The former village head is not 

 the only one who worships the 103-year-old.

 A walk down the freshly tarred 

 village road makes it clear that every villager knows about 

 the old mans mission.

 Even the road seems to revere 

 him. A small concrete slab where the path crosses another 

 reads: Satantrata Senani Road ? or freedom fighter road. 

 The path leads to a one-storey building ringed by trees. 

 On the gate is inscribed the words Ram Bachan Singh, freedom 

 fighter.

 It is this fighter in him that 

 drives him on. Everything is possible if you fight, 

 he says. It just takes longer.

 Coming from any other man, the 

 words may have sounded an idle boast. Not from the still 

 agile centurion who six years ago had asked 

 George Fernandes, then defence minister, if he could join 

 the Indian forces on the heights of Kargil.

 Had I gone there, I would 

 have gone to fire. I still can fire from revolvers, 

 he says. But during peacetime, other wars have to 

 be fought.

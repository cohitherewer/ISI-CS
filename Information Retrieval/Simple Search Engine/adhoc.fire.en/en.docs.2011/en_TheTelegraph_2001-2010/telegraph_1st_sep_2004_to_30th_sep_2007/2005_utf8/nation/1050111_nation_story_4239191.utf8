 Left historians get all-clear

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: An 

 academic committee headed by D. Bandopadhyay has exonerated 

 historians Sumit Sarkar, K.N. Panikkar, Basudeo Chatterjee 

 and P.S. Gupta of the charges levelled by former human resource 

 development minister Murli Manohar Joshi.

 The Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) during Joshi?s rule had charged the historians with distorting facts in the work they did for the Towards Freedom project. The ICHR withdrew the volumes authored by them on the ground that they had been selective about presenting facts on the freedom movement.

 The historians protested and furnished academic proof rebutting the charges.

 The council set up the committee to probe the dispute. Now that Joshi?s shadow no longer hovers over the ICHR, the report throws full light on the charges and the defence of the historians.

 Bandopadhyay has strongly indicted the council and accused it of hatching a ?plot to scuttle the Towards Freedom project?. The ICHR, the report said, ?fabricated lie after lie? to malign the work of the Left historians.

 One of the charges levelled by the Joshi dispensation was that Gupta?s volume dealing with the period between 1943 and 1944 underplayed the CPI?s unpatriotic role during the Quit India movement. The Bandopadhyay committee pointed out that the volume carried 151 documents on the CPI?s ?disappointing role?. The ICHR also criticised the historians for bypassing it and sending the volumes directly to Oxford University Press.

 The Left academics suspected that the real reason for putting the volumes out of circulation lay elsewhere. They said the Sangh parivar was upset about some documents presented in these volumes. The papers showed Hindu Mahasabha leader B.S. Moonje as a collaborator of the British, offering help to governor-general Lord Linlithgow.

 Survivor

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Port Blair, Jan. 21: Michael Mangal, serial number 103 on the list of missing or dead, surfaced two days ago, having survived the tsunami.

 He was stranded at Little Andaman island till January 17, when he was rescued by five Nicobarese tribals who spotted him waving a flag on the Pillow Panja shore. The rescuers, who had gone to Machal island with four Shompens, found Michael and took him to Campbell Bay on January 19. He is undergoing treatment at the primary health centre for a minor leg injury which he suffered when the tsunami hit. 

 Michael was reportedly dragged out to sea by the first wave and washed ashore by the second. He ran to higher ground and eventually made his way to a deserted village. There he found a small axe and survived on coconuts till he was found.

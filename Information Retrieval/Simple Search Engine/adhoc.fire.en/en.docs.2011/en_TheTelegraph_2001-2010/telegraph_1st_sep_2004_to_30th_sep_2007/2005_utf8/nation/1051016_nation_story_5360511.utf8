 Train-push boy dies

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Oct. 15: Muhammad Salim Ansari will never be able to identify the two policemen who robbed and threw him out of a running train as he headed home after three long months.

 The 14-year-old, perhaps the lone witness to the assault three days ago, died early this morning after a brief reunion with his parents.

 The boy breathed his last at Patna Medical College Hospital hours after doctors administered blood late last night. The teenager, who lost his left leg, had told The Telegraph yesterday he could identify the cops if he met them.

 Ansaris parents alleged that he died because doctors delayed proper treatment. Had they taken care of him well in time, his life would have been saved, father Nasim said.

 Hospital authorities in both Patna and Hajipur, where the boy was treated earlier, denied the charge. The boy must have died due to excessive loss of blood and delay in getting him admitted. We did our best, said Muhammad Ikram in Patna.

 Ansari had fled his Hajipur home to escape the scolding of his parents and the monotony of village life and the lessons in the madarsa. Three days ago, he had boarded the Sadbhavana (Harmony) Express, with a gift for his parents in his pockets. He was counting the money he had earned by selling tea when the two railway policemen snatched the notes from him and, when he tried to resist, threw him out of the running train.

 Inspector-general of railways A.C. Verma said the boys death was very unfortunate and added that the culprits will not be spared.

 The railway IG suspended 19 GRPF cops, the entire force on duty on the train that day, and the in-charge of the Hajipur GRP station.

 The move came even as Ansaris parents alleged that some police personnel had tried to force them to change their statement in a fresh complaint after the boys death saying he was not pushed out but fell off the train.

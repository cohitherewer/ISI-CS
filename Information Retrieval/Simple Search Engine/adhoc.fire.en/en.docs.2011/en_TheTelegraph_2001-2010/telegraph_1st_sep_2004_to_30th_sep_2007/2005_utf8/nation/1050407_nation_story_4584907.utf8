 CPM lectures Cong

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 6: The CPM began its 18th congress today with an advice to the Congress-led central coalition ? ?introspect? on economic policies.

 The party leadership warned the United Progressive Alliance government not to follow the economic policies of the previous National Democratic Alliance regime. 

 ?While we extend support to the UPA government to meet the exigencies of the current situation, let us make it clear that there will be no giving up on our basic agenda,? Harkishen Singh Surjeet told the conclave in his inaugural address.

 Jyoti Basu, in his speech at the end of the session, said: ?The people expect the UPA government to fulfil the commitment that its policies will be for the benefit of the ?aam aadmi?. This first of all requires a realisation that liberalisation has benefited only 10 per cent of the people.?

 The tenor of the speeches made it clear the CPM would walk a tightrope in the next few days, thrashing out a strategy to keep the BJP out and rein in the Congress?s economic policies.

 Since the UPA came to power, the CPM has joined issue with it on almost every economic policy. The government, however, has managed to push through some of its key policies like raising the ceiling on foreign direct investment in telecom and passing the patents bill.

 ?We must chalk out a path of development that is founded on concern for the vast masses who have not benefited from the growth,? Basu said. Pointing a finger at finance minister P. Chidambaram?s policy of wooing FDI for all sectors, he added: ?FDI should come in based on national priorities and the principle of mutual interest.?

 Surjeet and Basu made it clear that the BJP remains a potential threat. ?The BJP and its mentor, the RSS, still command substantial influence in the country. The BJP has vacated office but its pernicious legacy remains,? Basu said.

 The call for a third front was feeble and Surjeet indicated that the time was not conducive for such an alternative. ?A third alternative is desirable but it cannot be reduced to the concept of an electoral alliance,? he said.

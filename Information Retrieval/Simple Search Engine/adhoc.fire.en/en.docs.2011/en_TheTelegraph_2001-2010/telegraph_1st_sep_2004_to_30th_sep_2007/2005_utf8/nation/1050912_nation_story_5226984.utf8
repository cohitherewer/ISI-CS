 NGO bid to curb Net poaching

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The International Fund for Animal Welfare, which exposed illegal wildlife trade on the Internet, has recommended that governments include a legally-binding code for auction and other sites where wildlife is sold.

 The UK-based non-government organisation, which was surveying trading sites like eBay, found over 9,000 items and live animals for sale online. On offer were a gorilla, an endangered hawksbill turtle shot by its proud seller, shahtoosh shawls, tiger skins, elephant tusks, rhino horns, whale ear bones and even dried seahorses.

 The probe also revealed that at least 70 per cent of the animals, whose products were on sale, were endangered species and protected by international law.

 In its report Caught on the Web, the IFAW has said Internet service providers should join hands with governments, law enforcement agencies and other authorities in monitoring such online sale to get an idea of its volume and trends. 

 As for owners of websites where such items are traded, it has asked them to provide information on the legalities involved in wildlife trading, which poses new challenges to legislators and enforcement agencies. The report urges both portal owners as well as users to report sale of any suspicious items on the Net.

 The NGO says website owners should devote sufficient resources to ensure regular and detailed monitoring of site content for illegal wildlife items and to enable rapid and appropriate action in relation to any suspicious items.

 It points out that illegal wildlife trade is now an arrestable offence in the UK and some aspects of the trade are classified as serious and organised crime.

 Children killed in midnight strike

 Jammu: Terrorists killed three children 

 and their mother in a village in Doda district around midnight 

 on Sunday, reports our correspondent.

 Rubina, Rehana and Khursheed, all below 10, and their mother Nayeema Begum were killed on the spot in a grenade attack. Their father Abdul Aziz and sister Safiya were critically wounded.

 Residents of Forban Nashla village heard the explosions and the shrieks of the children, but snowfall and the fear of reprisal kept them huddled in their homes.

 ?All I know is that I have lost everything,? said Aziz.

 ?They demanded that doors be opened. But before I could respond to their angry call, the grenades exploded ? two in quick succession and wiped out my family,? he added.

 There is no trace of the killers and the snow has buried the footprints. The incident has evoked protests and a complete shutdown in Doda.

 In another incident, three terrorists were killed in an encounter with security forces in Gambhir Mogloan area in Rajouri district. 

 Rap on dental colleges

 New Delhi (PTI): The Dental Council of 

 India has warned 11 dental colleges across the country to 

 improve their infrastructure, failing which action would 

 be initiated against them.

 The colleges were found lacking proper facilities, including deficiency of teaching faculty, in a periodic inspection by the council, officials said.

 ?These colleges have been served with show cause notices by the council calling upon them to improve in a month?s time, failing which admissions for the current academic year are liable to be stopped,? they said.

 ?Initiation of proceedings, as per law, leading to withdrawal of recognition of dental colleges which do not improve, also cannot be ruled out,? they added.

 The colleges also lacked proper teaching faculty and had poor outpatient attendance. The council has also served notices to about 100 teachers who were found to visit their colleges for only two to five days a month. 

 ?Such teaching faculty has also been served with notices calling upon them to show cause why they should not be debarred,? it said.

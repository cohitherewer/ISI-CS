 Claws whetted for guerrillas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, March 19: A massive hunt is on in the Nallamala forests to nab the Maoist guerrillas who raided a police station in Guntur on March 12, killing four personnel. 

 Over 4,000 policemen, comprising Greyhound commandos and Central Reserve Police Force troopers, have surrounded the Maoist hideouts in the forests, spreading over 300 sq km and across the five districts of Prakasham, Guntur, Mahboobnagar, Kurnool and Nalgonda. Helicopters are also being used in the operations.

 Director-general of police Swaranjit Sen has said the combined force is inching towards the Maoists. 

 ?We are thoroughly searching the forests and sterilising the area so that such occurrences (like the Guntur raid) do not happen again,? Sen said.

 In Warangal district, about 180 km from Hyderabad, the police killed four Maoists at Andugulamedi village this morning. 

 ?Over 20 Maoists, led by their commander Yadanna alias D.V.K. Swamy, were waiting for over two days to ambush the police force,? said district superintendent of police Stephen Ravindra. 

 Among those killed in the exchange of fire were Latakka, Yadanna?s wife, and two other members of the special action squad. 

 Yadanna, who is involved in 70 cases, including 20 murders, is a secretary of the Warangal-Khammam district committee, a fundraiser unit of the Maoists. He carries a reward of Rs 3 lakh on his head.

 The peace talks between the Maoists and the Andhra Pradesh government had begun in October after three decades of rural unrest. But the talks derailed after the rebels walked out in January following continued killing of their men and combing operations in the forests by the police.

 Civil rights activist K.G. Kannabiran and poet P. Varavara Rao today requested for safe passage from the authorities so that they can make another attempt to bring the Maoists back to the talks table. 

 ?We hope both sides will see reason and listen to their conscience and choose the path of talks instead of the path of bullets,? said the chief moderator for the peace talks, S.R. Sankaran. 

 State home minister K. Jana Reddy was gheraoed in Mahboobnagar today when he went to participate at the funeral of a police official killed by the Maoists yesterday. 

 The Andhra Pradesh cabinet is likely to meet this evening to discuss law and order and decide whether the talks should resume or a ban clamped on the Maoists again. 

 The ban was lifted in 2004 after 12 years to facilitate the peace talks.

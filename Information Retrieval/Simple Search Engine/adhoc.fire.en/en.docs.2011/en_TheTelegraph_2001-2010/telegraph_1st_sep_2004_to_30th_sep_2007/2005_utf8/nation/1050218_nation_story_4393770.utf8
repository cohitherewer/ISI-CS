 CDs seized in priest scandal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 17: The Ahmedabad crime branch today raided acharya Ajendra Prasad?s bungalows in Vallab Vidhyalay and Vadtal and seized 116 CDs, 123 floppies, a video camera and a laptop.

 The raid comes in the wake of a priest of the Junagadh Swaminarayan temple and three touts of Tuesday?s arrest after the sadhu was caught on camera engaging in sex with women. Police had sought 14 days? remand to investigate the scandal. The sleuths wanted to find out who financed the touts who said during interrogation that they had videographed sadhus having sex with women at Prasad?s behest.

 The police raid was carried out in search of material to determine whether Prasad, who had been removed as head of the sect following a battle for supremacy, had masterminded the scandal to trap priests of the Vadtal sect.

 The police have arrested four more persons from Surat in connection with the case, including builder Nandlal Kala. The builder, who has been close to Prasad, owns the flat in Surat where the sadhus were allegedly secretly videographed having sex.

 Terror photos roll out in UP

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Aug. 19: A young 

 womans attempt to get copies printed from a roll of 

 film, apparently showing a militant camp in Kashmir, has 

 led police to suspect the existence of a jihadi network 

 in western Uttar Pradesh.

 The woman, who is untraced, had on August 16 brought the films to Geetanjali Studio in Deoband, home to leading Islamic seminary Dar-ul Uloom. After the studio owner took the roll to a colour laboratory in nearby Muzaffarnagar for printing yesterday, the lab contacted the police.

 As soon as our technicians developed the first negative, they were stunned, the lab owner told the police. It showed three bearded militants, AK-47 in hand, posing before the camera. 

 All 32 films in the roll show militants training recruits, Muzaffarnagar police sources said. 

 The trees and mountains in the background are suggestive of Kashmir ? though we cant be sure which side of the LoC it is, an officer said.

 Most of the recruits and their trainers look like Kashmiris. They are bearded and wear long, flowing clothes.

 The police of Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur, the district to which Deoband belongs, have launched a joint investigation. The Intelligence Bureau has been asked to help identify the place where the photographs were shot.

 The police have learnt that the woman who left the roll with the studio looked about 19, said the deputy inspector-general, Meerut Range, Rajkumar Viswakarma. 

 Plainclothes police are questioning people living in the neighbourhood of the studio to try and identify the woman.

 The pictures suggest Kashmir militants have associates in Deoband, said Muzaffarnagar SP D.K. Chowdhary. He said two persons have been arrested. 

 The police suspect that the roll was brought from a militant training camp by a recruit. He was perhaps allowed to take the pictures so that he could use them to impress other young men and persuade them to join the jihadis.

 Its also possible that militants had sent the rolls to an associate in Deoband with instructions to get copies printed and sent back, since doing that in Kashmir would be risky.

 Officers called in house scam 

 case

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi 

 High Court on Monday asked for all records from the registrar 

 of co-operative societies and the Delhi Development Authority 

 regarding the revival of co-operative group housing societies, 

 which it said were at the root of a Rs 4,000-crore housing 

 scam.

 The directive came from a division bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Rekha Sharma, which is monitoring the probe into the housing scam by a special investigation team led by a CBI deputy inspector-general. 

 The court asked the registrar, Satya Gopal, and the secretary of the authority to submit all records regarding revival of old and defunct housing societies along with the minutes of meetings in which their revival was cleared. 

 It suspected that the societies registered between the 1960s and the 1980s, which became defunct, could not have been revived by the builder mafia without the connivance of officials of the registrar of co-operative societies and the authority. The bench asked both the officers to be present in court on November 16, the next date of hearing.

 Doha blocks duos pass to London

 - Suspects with forged papers sent back

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, July 22: Two foreign terror suspects, who had left this city for London a day before the repeat bombings, are being questioned after being turned back from Doha airport.

 Jumar Khan, 23, of Afghanistan, and Syed Dawoud Hashmi, 47, of Iran, had landed in Doha by a Qatar Airways flight from Thiruvananthapuram on July 20. They were to catch a connecting flight to London, which was rocked by serial blasts the next day.

 But immigration staff found out that both were travelling on forged passports and put them on a flight back to Thiruvananthapuram. 

 After several rounds of questioning by the state police, Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing, the men have been handed over to the crime branch.

 Jumar had used a passport issued in the name of Ashito Eli of Israel while Dawoud used a South African passport posing as Fletcher Richard Murray, the police said.

 Officers believe Dawoud has spent 11 years in the country. He apparently arrived in Mumbai in 1994 and has been living in the Maharashtra capital and New Delhi since then. Jumar arrived in Delhi from Kabul on July 13, they said.

 The same day, the police believe, both left Delhi by the Rajdhani Express and reached Thiruvananthapuram two days later.

 The duo stayed at a resort at Kovalam before catching the flight to Doha, a source said. They had bought their tickets from Ultima Travels here.

 The crime branch suspects that the fake passports were obtained locally. Tourism industry sources say those hiding from the law generally see airports in Kerala as easier exit points compared with other international airports in the country, where security is stricter.

 The newly commissioned airport at Kochi used to be an easy transit point for Tamil militants based in Sri Lanka. Several suspected militants with fake passports have been detained at the airport in the past three years.

 The CBI has been probing a fake travel documents racket in Thiruvananthapuram.

 Deputy inspector-general of police Arun Kumar Sinha and city police commissioner B. Upadhyaya, who interrogated Dawoud and Jumar, said they were yet to get anything important out of the suspects. 

 Crime branch officers have refused to reveal what they have found out.

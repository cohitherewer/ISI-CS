 Meeting the coalition challenge head 

 on

 K.R. Narayanan, the 10th elected 

 President of India, will be remembered for setting an example 

 through his conduct of coalition politics.

 During his presidency from 1997 

 to 2002, Narayanan evolved healthy constitutional practices 

 to meet the coalition challenge, almost non-existent during 

 the first 50 years of Independence.

 On two occasions in the past, 

 his predecessors ? Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy in 1979 and Shankar 

 Dayal Sharma in 1996 ? had run into a political storm over 

 their exercise of the Presidents discretion in government 

 formation.

 The then undivided Janata Party 

 had threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against 

 Reddy for denying its parliamentary party leader Jagjivan 

 Ram an invitation to form the government after the Morarji 

 Desai ministry fell. That was in June 1979. The Janata Party 

 was routed in the 1980 elections and could not carry out 

 its threat.

 Sharmas move to appoint 

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the leader of the single largest party 

 (BJP) after the May 1996 elections, Prime Minister was attacked 

 by many political leaders who called him biased. 

 That Vajpayee had to quit just 13 days later because he 

 could not prove his majority in the hung House did not help.

 Narayanan was tested on four occasions 

 ? twice after elections and twice when the existing government 

 fell. Each time, he consulted all important political players 

 as well as legal luminaries before arriving at a decision. 

 He followed this up with a detailed communiqu? explaining 

 the reasons underlying his decision, ensuring that the use 

 of his discretionary power did not become the subject of 

 controversy.

 In November 1997, when Narayanan 

 was confronted with the fall of the I.K. Gujral government, 

 he held quick consultations to ascertain if an alternative 

 government could be formed without going for mid-term polls. 

 Since neither the Congress nor the BJP ? the two main parties 

 ? was ready, he went back to Gujral and asked for a cabinet 

 resolution recommending dissolution of the Lok Sabha to 

 pave the way for fresh elections.

 But the first real test came four 

 months later, after the March 1998 Lok Sabha polls in which 

 the BJP emerged as the single largest party but fell well 

 short of simple majority. The President said he would invite 

 the leader of the largest party or the leader of the single 

 largest pre-poll alliance for consultations 

 on government formation. Either way, Vajpayee fit the bill. 

 But he was far short of majority.

 Narayanan then asked the BJP leader 

 to give not just details of how he would drum up the numbers, 

 but also proof of support from prospective allies. It took 

 several days for Vajpayee to secure the letter of support 

 from the ADMKs Jayalalithaa. Narayanan delayed inviting 

 him to form the government till the letter came, and then 

 asked Vajpayee to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha within 

 10 days.

 The President followed the same 

 drill when the Vajpayee government fell in April 1999. Not 

 satisfied with Sonia Gandhis claim that she had the 

 support of 272 MPs, he asked for proof. When she failed 

 to show letters of support, Narayanan asked Vajpayee to 

 dissolve the Lok Sabha and order fresh elections.

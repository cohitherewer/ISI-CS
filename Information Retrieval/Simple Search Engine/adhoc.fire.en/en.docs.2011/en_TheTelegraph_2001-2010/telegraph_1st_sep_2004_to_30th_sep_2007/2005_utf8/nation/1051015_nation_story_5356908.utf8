 3-way war for Bhopal crown

 - Why fight when theres no vacancy, asks Gaur 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Oct. 14: The air is thick with suspicion and BJP circles are agog with conspiracy theories relating to a change of guard in Madhya Pradesh.

 A three-way succession war has broken out among Uma Bharti, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Sumitra Mahajan-Vikram Verma to replace incumbent Babulal Gaur. 

 Uma is a former state chief minister while Chauhan is the Madhya Pradesh BJP chief. Both Mahajan and Verma are former Union ministers, who hail from the influential Malwa region of the state.

 The bad blood is so intense that some time ago, Uma had to formally apologise to Verma for comparing his cerebral faculties to cow fodder.

 Gaur, too, is putting up a spirited fight, wondering at the fuss over the chief ministers chair when there is no vacancy. I am intrigued by inspired media stories about my exit. I have been directed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani to stay on and that is what I am doing, Gaur said. 

 The 76-year-old former union leader lobbed a challenge at his detractors. Not a single party MLA has made a demand for my ouster. This is not the way to do politics, he said while declining to name his detractors.

 A recent letter from Uma to RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan complaining against senior Sangh and BJP functionaries is seen as her growing frustration with the BJP leadership. The letter, targeting the RSSs Suresh Soni and the BJPs M. Venkaiah Naidu for preventing her from assuming the chief ministers chair, comes barely a month after her dharna at the party headquarters.

 BJP national general secretary Sanjay Joshi was caught off guard when Uma barged into his room, demanding a return to Shyamla Hills in Bhopal, the chief ministers residence. She sat on a dharna for hours. 

 Joshi ? a bachelor ? had to call up his office secretary and his wife for help till Rajnath Singh arrived late at night to prevail upon Uma to vacate the premises.

 Her claim is based on the premise that she had led the party to success in December 2003. An adverse court ruling had forced her to step down in August 2004 but subsequently she was absolved of all charges. Uma is, therefore, staking claim on the chief ministers post that she believes is hers.

 The whispers that the BJP central leadership was toying with Chauhan have rattled her. At 42, he is Umas contemporary and is perceived as a challenger.

 Today, Chauhan issued a statement in Gaurs favour: Gaur is the chief minister and will remain so. The state unit chief said he did not know who was behind speculation about a change of guard in the state. But we will find out.

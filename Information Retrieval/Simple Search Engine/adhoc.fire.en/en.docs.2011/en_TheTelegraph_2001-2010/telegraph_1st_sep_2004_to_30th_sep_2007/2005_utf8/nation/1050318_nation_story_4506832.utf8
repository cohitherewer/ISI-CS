 Cotton data fudge cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 17: Government officials have fudged figures to exaggerate yields of genetically modified cotton over the past three years, two non-government organisations have claimed.

 State agriculture officers monitoring BT cotton in Andhra Pradesh have been ?fudging data to show better performance?, Gene Campaign, a New Delhi-based research and advocacy organisation, said today. 

 Earlier this month, the country?s Greenpeace activists, too, had alleged that officers in Andhra?s Warangal district had ?tampered? with field data on BT cotton.

 The accusations come at a time when the government?s Genetic Engineering Advisory Committee is debating whether to permit commercial cultivation of Mahyco-Monsanto?s BT cotton, granted only a conditional three-year approval in March 2002.

 The committee met here this month and deferred the decision on a fresh three-year approval. However, it extended conditional approval to six new BT cotton varieties for some northern states.

 ?The committee ignored the experiences of farmers we?ve met in Andhra Pradesh,? said Divya Raghunandan, genetic engineering campaigner with Greenpeace.

 Gene Campaign and Greenpeace have both said the Mahyco-Monsanto BT cotton has delivered low yield and caused ?losses to farmers? in Andhra Pradesh. 

 Government scientists and Monsanto officials have rejected the claim.

 A Monsanto official said the rapid growth of the area where BT cotton has been planted ?is an endorsement of the technology by Indian farmers?. Farmland growing BT cotton shot up from 72,000 acres in 2002 to 1.2 million acres last year. 

 Dr Charu Dutt Mayee, a top government cotton scientist, said BT cotton has ?performed well? in India.

 But a report on BT cotton?s performance in Andhra during 2003-04 released by Gene Campaign today claimed the Mahyco-Monsanto BT cotton yielded 4 quintals per acre and another variety from the Rasi Seed Company 11 quintals.

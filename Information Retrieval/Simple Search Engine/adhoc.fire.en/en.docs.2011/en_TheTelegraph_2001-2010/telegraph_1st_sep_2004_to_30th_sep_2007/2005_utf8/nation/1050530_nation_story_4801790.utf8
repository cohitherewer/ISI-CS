 Hassle-free checks for air passengers

 New Delhi, May 29 (PTI): Long queues at the immigration counters in international airports could become a thing of the past when a new system is introduced to provide hassle-free entry to passengers coming from abroad.

 Following persistent demands by tourism and civil aviation ministries, the home ministry has issued a notification to introduce the Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS) from October 1, official sources said.

 Under the scheme, information on passengers would be sent by the airlines to the immigration authorities in India as soon as a flight takes off for an Indian destination. This could help pre-checking of the passengers and their faster clearance even before the flight lands in the country.

 The move is part of the overall effort to enhance facilitation to foreign tourists, including the recently launched Swagat Seva pilot project at Delhis Indira Gandhi International airport.

 The authorities are also planning to have separate counters for Indian passport holders returning from abroad.

 Tourism minister Renuka Chowdhury has taken up the issue with the home ministry and has also held several meetings with her civil aviation counterpart Praful Patel. 

 Moves are afoot to integrate the passport, visa and immigration services in a gradual manner, the sources said. All these steps together would reduce the immigration clearance time and ensure better security checks.

 A training programme for immigration officials has already started in order to help them provide service with a smile without compromising security, they said.

 There are about 67 immigration checkposts in the country at 22 airports, 30 land ports and 15 sea ports. The bureau of immigration controls these posts in Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Amritsar, Wagah and Attari.

 Gold glitters on corporate gift list

 Mumbai, Oct. 30: Neither a lukewarm stock market nor too-pricey-to-handle bullion has bridled the corporate gold rush this Diwali.

 The coolest gift continues to be gold, with exclusive watches coming a close second. The metals traditional association with the festive season apart, there is a higher perception value attached to a gold gift.

 I feel there is a definite increase in interest in gold as a corporate gift this year. Perhaps the rising international prices have made it an even more sought-after gift item, says Rajiv L. Popley, director, Popley Group, an 80-year-old premium jewellery establishment with bases in Mumbai and Dubai.

 Popleys biggest corporate orders have come from BPL, Idea Mobile and Elf Lubricants.

 With prices at a 17-year high, top bullion traders across Mumbai had been cautious about stacking up on gold for their corporate clients even a week ago.

 But as is the wont, sales skyrocketed as Dhanteras advanced and corporates who hadnt placed their orders before were frantically queuing up, said a member of the Bombay Bullion Association. ICICI has recorded a 100 per cent growth in gold coin sales.

 The most popular gift, however, is the gold voucher. Introduced a couple of years ago, these vouchers have become a hit this year.

 The vouchers being open ones, they give the companies the flexibility of deciding the amount to be spent on each. Besides they are very popular with the people who receive them as they can encash them at their convenience. If by chance the gold prices drop, they get more value out of a given voucher, says Popley.

 Reluctant to give details of the orders, Popley confirms associations with Asian Paints, Goodlass Nerolac, Kotak Mahindra, Johnson Tiles, Premier Automobiles and Coke.

 Top jewellers across the city confirm a hike of up to 30 per cent in sales of precious metals and diamond jewellery, of which 80 per cent has been gold products. The biggest surprise is the interest showed in platinum.

 Though it is nowhere near gold, top companies are looking at platinum as a special gift for their premium clients or contacts. Asian Paints and HR Johnson have placed orders for platinum coins, says Popley.

 Following right behind vouchers and coins are the precious metal pendants, some of them diamond-studded, says a Tanishq spokesman.

 With the metrosexual man still holding his status as the years fashion icon, corporate interest in male jewellery has been high. The traditional cuff links and tiepins are getting designer makeovers. But the most sought-after ones are from the international Omega range.

 Closely following the precious metals or diamond products are premium watches. A Ford Ikon official said the company was gifting Tissot watches to its most important clients and contacts, while Idea Mobile is going for the ultra-slim Swatch watches.

 Way above these are expensive family holidays, real estate and other such service-oriented gifts, shrouded in a veil of secrecy.

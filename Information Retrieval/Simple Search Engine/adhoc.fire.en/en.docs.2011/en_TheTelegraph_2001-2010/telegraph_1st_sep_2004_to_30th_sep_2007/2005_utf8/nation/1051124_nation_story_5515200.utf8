 Srinagar, Nov. 23: Suspected suicide militants today stormed a CRPF hub in a cinema taken over by security forces, killing five troopers and getting shot themselves.

 Taking cover behind a bus, the militants first threw grenades and opened automatic fire at a bunker outside what was once Firdous cinema. They then fired at a sentry at the gate when a vehicle was passing through and tried to race in, but one was shot dead at the entrance itself.

 The other managed to sneak into the main building of the 96 battalion headquarters in Hawal but was soon gunned down in the crossfire. Three CRPF jawans were killed and several others, including civilians, were injured in the 45-minute encounter.

 Immediately after the militant broke in, senior police and paramilitary officers reached the spot. They surrounded the building to ensure the intruder did not escape.

 Shopkeepers and pedestrians ran for cover as panic swept the area, witnesses said.

 The intruding militants first hurled grenades at the bunker of the entrance? and also resorted to heavy volume of automatic fire, CRPF inspector-general Ranjit Sinha said.

 Alert guards responded immediately and one of the intruders was killed at the entrance while the other managed to enter the main building.

 A senior CRPF officer said the company housed in the former cinema hall was detailed for active anti-militancy operations. 

 Since the Firdous cinema shut down in early 1990, its main building has been used as makeshift headquarters for various units of paramilitary forces on anti-militancy duty.

 Over the past month, militants have stepped up attacks in the Valley. Only last week, a car bomb exploded outside the corporate headquarters of the Jammu and Kashmir Bank, killing four people.

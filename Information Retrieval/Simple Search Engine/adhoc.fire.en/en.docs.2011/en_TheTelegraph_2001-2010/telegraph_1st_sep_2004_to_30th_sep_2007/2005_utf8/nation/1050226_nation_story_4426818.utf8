 BJP leaders shot in heartland 

 Lucknow: Two local BJP leaders were gunned down in western Uttar Pradesh on Friday, around the time chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was assuring the Assembly that law and order in the state was fine, reports our special correspondent.

 Rajveer Singh, Muzaffarnagar city BJP chief, and colleague Pramod Singh were on their way to the party office around 2.15 pm when four men stepped off a black Scorpio and showered bullets on them in Ealam locality, according to D.K. Verma, secretary, home.

 ?A probe team is looking into the cause of the murder. Senior officers are on the job,? Verma said. The resultant tension in the locality was quickly brought under control.

 Around this time, Mulayam Singh was citing the history of political murders in the state and telling the Assembly that the state, under his rule, was much safer than ever before. He was responding to Opposition fears that law and order was near collapse. He added that investments by multinational companies were going up as a result. ?People in the state feel they are safe. So it does not matter how much noise the Opposition makes.?

 By 3 pm, when the chief minister?s two-hour-long speech was over, the news of the killings had filtered down to Lucknow, triggering a political outcry. ?The rhetoric of the chief minister has been punctured. The reality of law and order is different. We demanded President?s rule in the state and we are sticking to it. We demand a CBI probe in the present incident,? said local BJP MP Hukum Singh.

 CBSE mulls grades system

 New Delhi (PTI): The marks system for evaluating performance in examinations, frequently blamed for inducing stress in students, may be on its way out.

 In two years? time, the Central Board of Secondary Education is likely to introduce a nine-point grading system for its Class X examination, which will replace the traditional marks system.

 ?At a recent meeting of 12 education boards, including (those) from Pakistan and Nepal, a general acceptance of the grading system emerged. Though the nitty-gritties need further discussion, we hope to introduce the grading system in our Class X examination by 2007,? CBSE director Ashok Ganguly said.

 Students taking their board examination that year will also see two other changes ? introduction of environmental education as a compulsory subject and internal assessment in mathematics.

 Ganguly said the new system will award letter grades like A*, A, B1, B2 and so on. Only the last grade will be treated as non-qualifying. The grading system may also be extended to the Class XII examination later, a CBSE official said.

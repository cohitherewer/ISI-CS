 Lok Pal bill set for deep freeze

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: A draft bill proposing to make judges of the Supreme Court and high courts accountable for omissions and commissions looks headed for limbo.

 Outgoing Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti and successor Y.K. Sabharwal have hit out at the National Judicial Commission bill under which complaints against all judges of all courts ? Chief Justice of India included ? will be referred to the Lok Pal and appropriate action taken.

 With Justice Lahoti saying the bill would tamper with the independence of the judiciary and Justice Sabharwal echoing him, the government is believed to be having second thoughts about introducing it in Parliaments winter session.

 Now a section of the government is viewing it as another flashpoint between the legislature and the judiciary?. The strong views expressed by both the Justices may result in its validity being challenged, an official source said.

 According to the bill, ready with law minister Hans Raj Bhardwaj, a complaint against the chief justice of India will be probed by other judges of the Supreme Court.

 Justice Lahoti has come down strong against this. Which CJI would compromise the dignity of his office and subject himself to the humiliation of inquiry by his junior judges? I would rather resign and go, he said.

 Justice Sabharwal wondered: How can a junior judge or a batch of junior judges inquire into the allegations made by anyone against the CJI?

 The bill also proposes to bring the Prime Minister and President under the purview of the Lok Pal. But a view is gaining ground that such high constitutional offices, including the CJI, should be kept out of its ambit.

 Members of Parliament and Assemblies and public servants would also come under scrutiny if an ordinary citizen complained to the Lok Pal about them.

 Most of the MPs fear they would come under the Lok Pal and do not want the bill passed on the pretext that high constitutional offices should not be subject to such inquiry, the official source said.

 Justices Lahoti and Sabharwal have said they would send their suggestions on the bill to Bhardwaj soon. Justice Sabharwal said he had informally met the minister and expressed his reservations.

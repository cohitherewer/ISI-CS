 Desam MLA?s body exhumed 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, March 7: The body of Telugu Desam Party MLA P. Ravindra, who was shot outside the party headquarters in Anantpur town on January 24, was exhumed today for a second post-mortem.

 Police have cordoned off Ravindra?s native village, Venkatapuram in Anantpur district, and imposed Section 144.

 The post-mortem was conducted by doctors at the district government hospital. Local revenue officials revealed that nine bullets are still embedded in the body.

 The murder had stirred a political storm with chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy?s son Jaganmohan and the state panchayat raj minister J.C. Diwakar Reddy named among the accused in an FIR lodged by the MLA?s family.

 Five of the six assassins along with P. Govardhan Reddy, who had allegedly planned the murder, surrendered to the police within a week of the incident.

 The CBI, which took up the case in the middle of February, has arrested three others, including those who gave shelter, transport and medical aid to the killers.

 The Desam, the main Opposition in the state, has slammed the Congress government for not arresting or interrogating either the chief minister?s son or the panchayat raj minister. It demanded an inquiry by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court.

 Besides the CBI, the state government has appointed a judicial commission led by retired judge Lakshman Rao to probe Ravindra?s murder and also a spate of political killings in Anantpur district.

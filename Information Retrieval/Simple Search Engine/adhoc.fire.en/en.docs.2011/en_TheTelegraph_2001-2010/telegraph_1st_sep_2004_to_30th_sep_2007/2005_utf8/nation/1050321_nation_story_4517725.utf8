The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 MP tapped for bribe

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, March 20: A jail official in the chief minister?s home town overstretched himself when he demanded money from an MP who happened to be Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy?s brother.

 Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy, the MP from Kadapa, had gone to the sub-jail in Pulivendla town yesterday to meet 10 Congress workers. They had been arrested following a land dispute with their counterparts from the Telugu Desam Party.

 The Congress workers told the MP that the jail authorities were not taking ?good care? of them. The hint must have been to good food and entertainment and even mobile phones that jails in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh are said to provide to political inmates.

 The Desam workers, said to number 80, were apparently enjoying all the facilities.

 Vivekananda Reddy, not so known in public, is said to have asked jail superintendent Srinivasa Naik to arrange better facilities for his party supporters.

 Naik, who was recently transferred to Pulivendla, did not recognise the leader and told him such demands cost money. ?Give me Rs 10,000 to give them good food and also entertainment,? he reportedly told the MP.

 Vivekananda Reddy was taken aback but, true to his cool nature, paid up and drove away from the jail.

 The jail employees, who were witness to the proceedings, told Naik about the MP. The panicky superintendent rushed after the leader and followed him 25 km to Vempalli.

 He managed to meet Vivekananda Reddy after a wait of over two hours and apologised. He not only returned the Rs 10,000 but also Rs 2,000 that he had taken earlier from local leaders who had visited the workers in jail.

 The MP is said to have told off the jail official but has not pressed any charges.

 Vivekananda Reddy was in the news recently for offering to resign his parliamentary seat in favour of his chief minister-brother?s son, Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy.

 He withdrew the offer after his party president Sonia Gandhi pulled him up for the move.

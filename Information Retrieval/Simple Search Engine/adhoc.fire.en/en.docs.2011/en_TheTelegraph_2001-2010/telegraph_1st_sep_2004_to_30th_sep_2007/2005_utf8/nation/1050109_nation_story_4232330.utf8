 Couple held for trying to kill son

Madurai (PTI): A couple was arrested on Saturday for trying 

to kill their 11-year-old son by injecting poison after he was found to have AIDS.

 The boy had contracted the killer disease through blood transfusion when he underwent an operation in a private hospital some years ago, police said.

 The parents, who were anguished when they came to know that the boy had AIDS, had accepted a suggestion made by a person that they could kill him by injecting poison.

 The boy was receiving treatment at the Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital for the past few days.

 The couple got the boy discharged and had asked the person, said to be a paramedic, to inject poison just before they left by car for Terkuteru, 30 km from here.

 On the way, the driver of the car got suspicious as the boy vomited and complained to the Othakadai police. The parents, who were taken into custody, allegedly confessed that they had sought the help of the paramedic to inject poison, as they did not want the boy to suffer.

 The boy was rushed to the intensive care unit of the Rajaji Hospital and was under treatment, police said.

 Indians arrested in Dubai

Dubai (PTI): Several Indians, including 26 women, have been 

arrested during recent raids at a residential area here for staying allegedly 

without proper documents.

 ?We have asked for more information from the police and if they ask for outpasses, we will provide them so that they can be sent home,? an official with the Indian consulate said.

 Several Indian men had also been arrested in the raids, official sources said.

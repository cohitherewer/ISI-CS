 New Delhi, March 31: One aspired to become chief minister in another five years, the other had turned down the top job when it was offered to him 19 years back. Today, in a final turn, fate terminated the careers of Om Prakash Jindal and Surender Singh ? both senior ministers in the new Congress-led Haryana government.

 They were killed in the chopper crash near Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh. 

 Jindal, an established industrialist in the steel sector, had aspired to become chief minister had his party high command chosen to elect a non-Jat community candidate in place of Bhajan Lal. 

 At 75, he hoped his turn would come in the next five years, although he had lost the top job to Bhupinder Singh Hooda. 

 But Surender?s case was different. The younger son of veteran Jat leader and former chief minister Bansi Lal was a relatively young politician at 59. He was just starting a promising stint in the Congress after his father merged the Haryana Vikas Party with the Congress. 

 Surender was not looking to become chief minister this time. He was prepared to wait. After all, he had the chief ministership offered to him in 1986 by none other than then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and had turned it down. 

 Surender, an MLA then, got a surprise call in Chandigarh from Rajiv Gandhi asking to him rush to Delhi for a meeting. There were clear hints that Surender should be prepared to take over from Bhajan Lal as chief minister. 

 Rajiv Gandhi was concerned about the prospect of a defeat in the Assembly polls due in 1987 if Bhajan Lal continued to lead the Congress government. 

 ?I was stunned as I arrived in Delhi the next day. MLAs had already been summoned to the national capital for the Congress legislature party meeting to elect me as the leader,? Surender had narrated during the course of his Assembly election campaign in his constituency of Tosham in February.

 He was ushered into the Prime Minister?s chamber by V. George. ?Rajiv hugged me and said, ?now everything is ready?. Be ready to take over.? Surender had said: ?Sir, do I have the permission to say something.? I am not prepared for it.? 

 ?You are young. You have my full support. We will take care. You don?t worry,? Rajiv is said to have reassured him.

 Surender then went straight to his father?s office in Transport Bhavan (Bansi Lal was a cabinet minister then). Also present was Madhavrao Scindia, then a junior minister. Scindia also died in a helicopter crash.

 ?I was still not sure, not sure of taking the MLAs along. I was scared of defeat in the elections due within 10 months and I did not want to ruin my political career. But my father took me in his car to meet senior leaders which is usual before a leader takes charge as chief minister. I told this to my father.? 

 Father and son went to meet Arjun Singh, who was the party vice-president. Singh called up Rajiv Gandhi to convince him that Surender was not ready for the job. Rajiv Gandhi agreed. In a couple of hours, Bhajan Lal resigned and Bansi Lal replaced him. 

 At 40, Surender had hesitated when the call came for the big job. His turn will never come. 

 As agriculture and revenue minister, his last order this morning was to computerise land records in the state.

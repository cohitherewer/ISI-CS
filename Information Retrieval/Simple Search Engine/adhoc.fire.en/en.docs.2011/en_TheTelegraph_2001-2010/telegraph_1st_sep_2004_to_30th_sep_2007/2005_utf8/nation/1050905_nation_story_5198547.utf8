 Lover turns killer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 4: Hooch-den operator Virendra Kanauj killed 18-year-old Parveen here not because she protested against gambling but apparently as she refused to reciprocate the orphans feelings.

 Virendra, who was picked up by police today for yesterdays daylight murder at Sawadatganj, said he was waiting near Parveens house with his friends when she was returning home with her mother Suraiya.

 The man said he first pushed Parveen and, as she lay on the road, picked up a stone slab to hit her head.

 During interrogation, Virendra claimed that he had a four-year affair with the college girl, who promised to marry him. She wanted proof of my love. And this is what I did, he said, baring his arms to show Parveen tattooed on them.

 I used to assist her financially, too, and we had planned to get married. Last week, she said her marriage was fixed with someone else?. I was devastated. I cried a lot and then began to drink.

 No one came to Parveens rescue as she bled to death. The killers also attacked Suraiya, who had to be hospitalised.

 After the goons fled, public anger erupted on the streets of Lucknow. A mob set ablaze gambling cells, attacked passing vehicles and set houses on fire. 

 Two of Virendras associates, who were named in the FIR, were also rounded up today.

 Parveen was a student and Virendra, an orphan, a hooch den operator. She could not have reciprocated his love, Lucknow senior superintendent of police Ashutosh Pandey said. It appears to be a case of unrequited love. (But) we are still investigating the case, he added.

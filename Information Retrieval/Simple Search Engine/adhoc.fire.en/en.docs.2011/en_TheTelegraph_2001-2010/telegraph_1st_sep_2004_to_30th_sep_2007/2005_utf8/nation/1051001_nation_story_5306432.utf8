 Merc with fake sticker sets off House scare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 On their toes

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: A 

 day after India celebrated Independence Day this year, there 

 was a huge security scare in Parliament when both Houses 

 were in session.

 A Mercedes (DL-6C 3124) was spotted standing suspiciously in the parking lot for self-driven vehicles, in spite of the Rs 200 crore spent to shore up security after the 2001 Parliament attack.

 The car appeared to have cleared the multi-layer security checks and had an authorised colour entry label displayed on the windshield.

 But a security man smelt a rat. The windshield label caught his eye, and on taking a second look, he thought it was a duplicate one. He immediately alerted his seniors who went into a tizzy.

 In minutes, security personnel dashed to the parking lot to check the label. They found it was a colour photocopy of an authorised parking pass issued to an MP.

 The hologram we use on the label cannot be duplicated. On closer examination, it was found that the hologram on the duplicate label was one usually stuck on undergarments, a source said.

 Securitymen then began to comb the Parliament premises for any militants who might have sneaked in. But intelligence personnel led them to Rajasthan BJP MP Vijayendra Pal Singh, who was quietly attending a parliamentary committee meeting in the annexe.

 When he was questioned, the MP said the Mercedes was his and he had self-driven it into the premises. Then why was the label a duplicate one, he was asked.

 The MP is believed to have told the security personnel not to create a fuss. He had photocopied the label because he was using his second car as the car with the original label had gone for repairs.

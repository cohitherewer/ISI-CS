 Mumbai, June 23: A Nasa team was in the country, looking for rocks that could resemble the ones found on Mars.

 The team of Amitabh Ghosh, Michael Wyatt and Jim Rice was here following more evidence of the presence of water on the planet. 

 Rover Spirit, the Nasa satellite that is currently doing its stint on Mars, has sent pictures of sedimentary rocks, which the scientists said contain chemicals that could only form into rocks in the presence of water.

 So Nasa is making a worldwide effort to study Martian rocks against their counterparts on Earth, to know the red planet better. 

 The worlds leading space research organisation intends to build a library of rocks, rather, a library of chemicals that are present in sedimentary rocks, to see if they are present in Mars rocks as well.

 The team was here to collect samples. They were also armed with a programme called Rock Around the World for the purpose. It visited several cities in India, including Chennai, Hyderabad and New Delhi, and spoke at planetariums, requesting everyone to send rock samples to Nasa. By post. Children and students are most welcome to send samples of rocks, any rock, preferably between 2 inches and 6 inches.

 Adults are also welcome.

 The presence of sedimentary rocks changes the perception of Mars as a surface of volcanic rocks, said Ghosh. It also means that it increases the possibility of life on Mars, though no evidence of life has been found on the red planet so far.

 The scientists said the presence of water on Mars is a certainty. 

 A water body certainly existed on Mars. There is a sulphide called jarosite remaining, left after the water evaporated. But whether life is there or not is a complicated question, said Ghosh.

 Rover Spirit has sent pictures of frost. There are clouds, too, he added.

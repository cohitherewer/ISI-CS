 Teachers

 Durban, Aug. 29 (PTI): Faced with an acute shortage of mathematics and science teachers, South Africa is looking to India for skilled tutors.

 Cameron Dugmore, minister of education in the western Cape province, said the proposal comes in the wake of concerns that highly-qualified mathematics and science teachers had quit in the past 11 years. Most had either taken retirement packages or migrated to New Zealand, Australia, Canada or the UK.

 Dugmore said he planned to recruit teachers from countries like India that have an abundance of well-qualified mathematics, science and technology teachers.

 The proposal has been welcomed by some educationists in Kwazulu-Natal, which has an acute shortage of teachers for the subjects.

 A member of the provincial parliament, Ram Maharaj, said he was confident that qualified teachers from India would be a welcome boost to education in the province.

 Indias teachers have the added value of being proficient in English and have served other countries with dedication and distinction, he said.

 However, the import of teachers from India or any other country should not deprive or even disadvantage qualified or aspirant South African teachers. It would also be prudent to recall suitably-qualified teachers who have taken retrenchment packages, he said.

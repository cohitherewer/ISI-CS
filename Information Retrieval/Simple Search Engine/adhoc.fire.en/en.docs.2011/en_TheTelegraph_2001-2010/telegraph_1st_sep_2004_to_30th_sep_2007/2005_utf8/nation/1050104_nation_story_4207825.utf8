 ?Independent? Dal warns BJP on poll

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Jan. 3: An angry Janata Dal (United) today indicated it was ready to consider breaking ties with the BJP if the Congress and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) joined hands to constitute an anti-RJD alliance for the coming Assembly elections.

 The provocation for the JD (U)?s retort was BJP vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi?s statement that the NDA, on a request by BJP president L.K. Advani, had ?authorised? Dal leader Nitish Kumar to hold alliance talks with Ram Vilas Paswan?s LJP.

 While JD (U) legislator Upendra Kushwaha denied any such ?authorisation? and stressed his was an ?independent party with an independent mind?, the LJP hardened its stance on having any truck with the Dal unless it dumps the BJP. ?We will not talk to the JD (U) unless it makes a public announcement of snapping ties with the BJP,? Paswan said in Delhi.

 But Modi today claimed he had said ?nothing new? because Nitish Kumar has been talking to Paswan for nearly a month now, and this was not happening without the consent of the BJP and the NDA.

 ?There is no change in the situation. We have not opposed Kumar?s offer to Paswan to lead a broad-based alliance to defeat the RJD,? he added.

 Kushwaha, however, advised the BJP to ?exercise restraint? on its statements, especially because the alliance talks were at a ?crucial juncture?. But the JD (U) leader also requested Paswan to ?soften? his stance vis-?-vis the BJP because alienating it would only help the RJD.

 ?We are also trying to make an alliance that is in a position to defeat the RJD. The LJP has already said it would not align with the RJD under any circumstances. It would be, therefore, advisable to exercise restraint in our public statements,? Kushwaha said.

 JD (U) sources claimed three-four rounds of talks have been held between Kumar and Paswan and the movement was in a ?positive direction?. The LJP, however, has not ruled out contesting all 243 seats on its own and party leaders said they would release their ?independent list? of candidates in due course.

 Polling is slated for February 3, 15 and 23 while nominations for the first phase begin on January 10.

 The chances of the Congress snapping its ties with the RJD appear remote and despite the former pegging its demand for seats at 100 or more, sources in both parties are hopeful of an ?amicable settlement?.

 The CPI and the CPM look set to continue their ?alliance? with the RJD.

 Laloo Prasad Yadav?s party, so far, has received more than 3,500 applications from ticket-hopefuls while the other poll players too have reported a ?similar rush?.

 Outfits like the CPI-ML and the Samajwadi Party have started their efforts to constitute a ?third front? that would maintain distance from the Congress, BJP and the RJD.

 The Bahujan Samaj Party has also said it would contest a ?good? number of seats on its own and not align with any other party.

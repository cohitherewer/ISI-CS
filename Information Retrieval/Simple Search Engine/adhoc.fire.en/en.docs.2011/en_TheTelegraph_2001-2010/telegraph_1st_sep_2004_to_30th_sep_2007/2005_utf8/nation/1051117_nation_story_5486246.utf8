The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Salem bristles at media buzz

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Monica

 Mumbai, Nov. 16: Abu Salems 

 legal team is very worked up by media reports on the deported 

 don.

 At the Tada court hearing the case against Salem, his advocates today moved an application, objecting to the media carrying minute details on the dons interrogation and his relationship with Monica Bedi, who was also deported from Portugal.

 The master extortionist in Bollywood was also perturbed by the reports, said his lawyer Ashok Sarogi, who met Salem this evening with another lawyer, Rashid Khan.

 Salems advocates moved the application, which will be heard on November 21, naming the Union ministry of information and broadcasting and the CBI, the investigating agency, as parties. 

 The application strongly objected to the following items in the media:

 Four alleged fake passports 

 owned by Salem

 Reports written suggesting 

 the reporter was given a personal interview by Salem

 Salem allegedly shedding 

 tears at the mention of his son from his alleged first marriage

 Reports suggesting Monica 

 was recruited by Salem because he didnt know English, 

 while she did, and could help with his business

 Reference to Salems 

 various frozen bank accounts

 Reference to his alleged 

 property worth crores in several parts of the world

 A split between Salem and 

 Monica.

 The application demanded a bar on giving out such information to the media, a matter the legal team had also taken up last week. The court has clearly said that no information that has not been presented to the court should be passed on to the public, said Shabana Shah, one of the lawyers.

 The CBI has told the court that it did not give out information to the media. We would like to know, then, who is the source of the information deluge on Salem, she said. She did not say whether the reports were true or false.

 Salems advocates are taking great pains to stress that his relationship with Monica is a strong one.

 The application will come up for hearing on November 21. 

 Tomorrow the court will issue its order on another application by the legal team, asking that it be allowed to be present within earshot of Salems interrogation.

 We informed Salem about some of the media reports, said Ashok Sarogi, one of the lawyers of the defence. He said that they were making him out to be something he was not.

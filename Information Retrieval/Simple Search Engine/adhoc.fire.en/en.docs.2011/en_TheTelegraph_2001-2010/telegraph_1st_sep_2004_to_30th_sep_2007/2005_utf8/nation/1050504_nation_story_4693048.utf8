 Munnabhai has CM as patient

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, May 3: Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, yesterday became client No. I for Doctor Munnabhai.

 Sit easy, this doctor isn?t actually the one who prescribes pappis (kisses) and jhappis (hugs) in the Bollywood blockbuster Munnabhai MBBS. A software professional here has only borrowed the name to promote doctormunnabhai.com that offers medical services at lower than market rates.

 Reddy would vouch for it. He launched the portal at the state secretariat on Monday and registered for an MRI at a throwaway price of Rs 1,500.

 It would have cost him around Rs 3,500 in most diagnostic centres in the city. 

 The brain behind Doctor Munnabhai 24?7, Shantan Reddy ? an IT pro who is also a medical practitioner ? said hospitals across the world have different prices for services offered in different seasons and hours. 

 His firm has tied up with several top-notch hospitals in Hyderabad and Bangalore to offer premium services.

 Reddy would know soon when and where he?s got the appointment. Any client who registers with Munnabhai would have to quote a price for the services he/she wants to avail. The company would respond to the e-mail or SMS request to confirm the appointment. ?We will send either an SMS or e-mail confirming your request and our offer. You pay us either at the hospital or earlier through a courier service. The money will be refunded, if your service (requirements) are not met,? said Shantan Reddy.

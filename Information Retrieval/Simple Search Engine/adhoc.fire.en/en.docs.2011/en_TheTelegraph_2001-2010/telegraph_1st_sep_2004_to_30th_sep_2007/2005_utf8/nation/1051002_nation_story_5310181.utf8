 Law chases Siwan MP

 Patna, Oct. 1: Wanted by police, elusive Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin is in fresh trouble with authorities ordering a probe into whether he appeared for a law examination in Muzaffarpur or someone impersonated him, reports our correspondent.

 If he has committed a fraud, we might approach the Lok Sabha for the cancellation of his membership, deputy inspector-general Gupteshwar Pandey said in Muzaffarpur today.

 Reliable police sources said the Rashtriya Janata Dal leader, wanted in several cases and for whom a nation-wide alert has been sounded, did not appear for the LLB Part II examination last month. Police knew in advance that he had got himself registered for the LLB examinations under Bhimrao Ambedkar (Bihar) University and might turn up at RDS College for the exam. Our special branch men were lying in wait but he eluded us, the source said.

 District superintendent of police R. Sanjay, who was asked to probe the latest controversy involving the MP, said: We have interrogated the college principal, T. Alam, at length. He seems to be oblivious of the entire episode. Investigations are on.

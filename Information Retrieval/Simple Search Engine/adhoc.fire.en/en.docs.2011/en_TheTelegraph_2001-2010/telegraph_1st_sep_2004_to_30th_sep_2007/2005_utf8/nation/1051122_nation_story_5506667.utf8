 Laloo snarls at forecast sting

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Nov. 21: His detractors might be already celebrating his doom and his supporters losing sleep. But not a line of worry shows on Laloo Prasad Yadavs face on the eve of the Bihar election results.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal boss has no doubt that his party will emerge victorious with a thumping majority ? and on its own. 

 The man who has ruled Bihar for 15 years at a stretch today rattled off the exact numbers that he thinks the RJD and its allies will win. The RJD will get 125 seats, the Congress will bag 28 and the CPM and the NCP will get three each.

 Reminded that the total added up to a whopping 159, the RJD chief shot back: And you people (media) think that I am joking. Do not have doubts for I have my own calculations. Everyone said that I had gone silent and was busy attacking the Election Commission. In fact, I was moving among the poor people, who continue to be my voters.

 Laloo Prasad came down heavily on the media for predicting his defeat. Ek se ek think-tank ho gaya hai media mein (too many think-tanks have taken birth in the media). You people have predicted victory for the NDA, so go and take the reaction from them. Why have you come here? he asked a television reporter. 

 His wife, former chief minister Rabri Devi, was by his side during the two-hour interaction where no cameras were allowed.

 The role of the media has been very dirty. They started a culture of predicting the results with a view to influencing the voters and even inciting them.... The fact is that our votes have consolidated and we have a much bigger area of influence than anyone else. The RJD will get absolute majority on its own, Laloo Prasad said.

 I have told my masters (voters) not to trust the television channels and the newspapers. They are all bluffing. And do not come for a reaction in the morning. I will give one only in the evening when all results have come in, Laloo Prasad said, firmly refusing all requests to let broadcasters enter 1 Anne Marg for a live telecast. Stay outside and do the coverage from there. Do not create a problem by coming inside, he said.

 Tulbul talks flop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 29: India and Pakistan today failed to break the deadlock on the Tulbul navigational project but, for the first time, managed to keep agreed minutes of the two-day talks that ended this afternoon.

 The agreed minutes ? in effect a document to keep a record of what was discussed ? can serve as a reference point at the next meeting.

 Some sections in South Block played it down, arguing that in India-Pakistan relations, such documents will not mean anything if the mood becomes hostile. But others felt even small steps like these will help the two sides come closer.

 The brief joint statement issued after the meeting said: The talks were held in a cordial and constructive atmosphere. The two sides exchanged views on the project and reaffirmed their commitment to the Indus Water Treaty of 1960. 

 The two sides agreed to continue the discussions at the next round of the dialogue process with a view at resolving the issue in accordance with the provision of the treaty. 

 The Tulbul navigational project, which Pakistan describes as the Wullar Barrage, is one of the eight issues in the Composite Dialogue.

 India describes it as a navigational project which will help river transport on the Jhelum from Baramullah to Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir. But Pakistan insists it is a storage project which violates the treaty.

 Indian officials feel Pakistans objection to the project is part of its policy to thwart any development in Jammu and Kashmir. 

 Islamabad does not want any developmental project in the state to be undertaken till the Kashmir issue is resolved according to its satisfaction, a senior foreign ministry official said. 

 Sections in the Indian establishment even detected a slight toughening of stand on Pakistans part.

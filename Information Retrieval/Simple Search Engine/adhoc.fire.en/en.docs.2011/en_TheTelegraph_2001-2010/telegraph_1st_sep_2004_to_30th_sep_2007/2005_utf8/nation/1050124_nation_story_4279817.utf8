 Worry tempers pipeline high

Manmohan Singh, Khaleda Zia: Pipe dream 

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: The euphoria in South Block over Bangladesh?s landmark decision to allow the transnational gas pipeline to pass through its territory seems to be ebbing.

 There is growing realisation in the Indian establishment that Dhaka has put the diplomatic ball in Delhi?s court for forward movement.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who travels to Dhaka on February 5 for the Saarc summit is scheduled to meet his Bangladeshi counterpart, Begum Khaleda Zia, on the sidelines of the meet. A date has not yet been set for the meeting.

 The leaders are sure to try and move relations forward in the wake of an agreement on the transnational gas pipeline.

 At a meeting between Myanmar, India and Bangladesh in Yangon earlier, an agreement was signed allowing the pipeline to carry Myanmarese gas to India through Bangladesh. Since this is the first time in 30 years that Dhaka has agreed to allow its territory to be used for transporting any commodity, especially gas, to India, Delhi views it as a significant development that could allow strong economic ties to be forged in the region.

 The dominant view in South Block is still in favour of looking at the Yangon development as a positive one. ?At least we managed to get the Bangladeshis to agree to let the gas pipeline pass through its territory. And this is something they had refused to do in the past,? a senior official said.

 But many policy makers here are now willing to acknowledge that much of what Dhaka has agreed on will depend on Delhi?s response to its demands. ?The ball has been put back in the Indian court,? a foreign ministry official said.

 At the Yangon talks, which also became part of the joint statement, Bangladesh managed to get India to acknowledge three of its demands: access to hydroelectricity in Bhutan and Nepal through India?s network, a trade corridor through India to reach Bangladeshi goods to Nepal and Bhutan and urgent sops from Delhi to reduce Dhaka?s huge trade deficit.

 Indian officials who were part of the talks pointed out that the demands were mentioned in the statement to make it easier for Bangladesh energy minister Musharraf Hussain to sell the transnational pipeline move to his domestic audience. But sceptics are asking if the concessions India made to get Bangladesh to agree to the deal meant that any forward movement on the project depends on how satisfied Dhaka is with Delhi?s response to its three demands.

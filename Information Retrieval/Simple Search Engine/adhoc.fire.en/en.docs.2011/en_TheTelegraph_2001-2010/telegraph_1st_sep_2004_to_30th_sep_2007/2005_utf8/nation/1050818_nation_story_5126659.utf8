 Banglas 30-year war

 A CORRESPONDENT

 Dhaka, Aug. 17: The demand and choice of target of those behind todays blasts reflect the deepest divide in Bangladeshs rift-ridden society: that between the liberal section of the civil society and Islamic fundamentalists.

 The government had cracked down on Islamic terrorists in February, banning the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen ? suspected masterminds of todays blasts ? and the Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh. It arrested many militants, including a university teacher who leads a religious organisation, earning applause from the media and social organisations.

 Today, the bombs targeted the symbols of civil society ? government offices, courts, universities and press clubs. Leaflets found at the sites said: It is time to implement Islamic law in Bangladesh. There is no future with man-made law. They warned NGOs to stop anti-Islamic activities or else be uprooted.

 Bangladesh had banned religious politics and introduced secularism and socialism after it achieved independence from Pakistan in 1971. With the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the nations founding father, the ban was lifted and the principles of secularism and socialism were dropped.

 Religious groups staged a comeback to the mainstream politics. Hardline outfits ? Jamaat-i-Islami, Islami Oikya Jote, Islamic Shashantantra Andolon and Bangladesh Khilafat Andolon ? mushroomed. Most of them campaigned for Bangladesh to be governed by Islamic laws.

 The early part of this year saw a spate in political violence, generally targeting the liberals. The Opposition Awami League lawmaker and former finance minister, Shah A.M.S. Kibria, and four others were killed in a grenade blast on January 27. 

 Awami League chief and former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also the leader of Opposition, escaped with her life as scores of grenades were thrown at a party rally in Dhaka. The blasts left the president of the Mahila Awami League and 22 others dead.

 The bombers attacked film and theatre audiences. Several died in explosions at cinemas in western Mymensingh and southern Satkhira. At least three persons were killed in separate blasts as they watched plays in northern Bogra and Natore districts.

 The Bangladesh-born British high commissioner, Anwar Chowdhury, was seriously wounded and two persons were killed when a grenade was thrown at him at the shrine of Hazrat Shahjalal in northeastern Sylhet.

 Secular journalists, teachers and intellectuals were targeted. Poet Shamsur Rahman was attacked by Harkatul militants a few years ago. Humayun Azad, a Dhaka University teacher and writer, was attacked by a group of Islamists. 

 Death threats have been issued to Dhaka University teachers Muntasir Mamun and Arefin Siddiqui, columnist and former editor of Bhorer Kagoj Abed Khan and journalist Shahriar Kabir.

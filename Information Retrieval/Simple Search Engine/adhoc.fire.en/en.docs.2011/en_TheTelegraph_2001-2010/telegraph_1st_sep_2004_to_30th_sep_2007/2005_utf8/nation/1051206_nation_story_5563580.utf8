 CPM still stands by critic of America

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: Natwar Singhs own party, the Congress, wants him to quit. But the CPM is ready to take up cudgels on his behalf.

 Three days after the Volcker controversy hit the UPA government with renewed vigour, CPM MP Nilotpal Basu said his party has no intention of asking Natwar ? a minister without portfolio ? to step down.

 The CPM was the first party to seek an inquiry into the findings of the Volcker report. But why should we ask Natwar to resign on the basis of what Volcker himself has described as unverified charges? Basu asked after the NDA disrupted both Houses of Parliament for the second day and the Congress dropped Natwar from the steering committee.

 Outgoing ambassador to Croatia Anil Mathrani had in a recent interview accused Natwar of accepting oil coupons from Iraq for son Jagat and the Congress, substantiating part of the Volcker report charges. There is an inquiry going on. We should wait for its report before demanding anybodys resignation, the MP said.

 The Lefts fondness for Natwar can be attributed to his stand against the US. The Left parties have soft-pedalled the allegations, virtually echoing Natwars argument that the Volcker report deliberately defamed those who took a stand against Washington.

 In the November 13 issue of Peoples Democracy, the CPM mouthpiece, party general secretary Prakash Karat wrote: The Congress party need not be apologetic or defensive about its ties with Iraq and other third world organisations which were intent on defending their national sovereignty.

 He added: Much of the attack directed at the UPA government and the Congress party by the BJP and the right-wing media stems from their ideological affinity with the US and its designs on West Asia.

 Sources said a section of the Congress, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, was in favour of yielding to the US. In Natwar, the Left saw a buffer against this trend. 

 After the Justice Pathak Committee was instituted, the CPM said it would be better if Natwar resigned as foreign minister, but made it clear that it had no objections to him continuing as minister without portfolio.

 The CPI, which had earlier issued a statement demanding that Natwar quit the cabinet, changed its tune after the renewed heat on the UPA. The partys general secretary, A.B. Bardhan, gave the minister an innocent certificate at a news conference.

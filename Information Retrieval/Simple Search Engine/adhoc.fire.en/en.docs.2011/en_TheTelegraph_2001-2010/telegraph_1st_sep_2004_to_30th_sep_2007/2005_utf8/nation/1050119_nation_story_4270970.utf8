 Strike talks to continue 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 18: Talks with the government and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav tonight failed to break the deadlock but hope has not died as another meeting is slated for tomorrow.

 ?The talks this time were on a new and positive note and we ended up agreeing on a number of issues. We hope the strike will be called off after tomorrow?s talks,? general secretary of the Bihar Rajya Sarkari-Ardhsarkari Sevakarmi Samyukth Morcham Rambali Prasad, said.

 ?The government will discuss the matter with the Election Commission team, which will arrive here tomorrow. We will meet the demands of the employees with its due permission,? RJD leader Ram Kripal Yadav said.

 Describing the Bihar government?s attitude as repressive, the employees took out a rally earlier today and demonstrated in front of the district magistrate?s office. DM Sudhir Kumar had yesterday ordered the employees to end their strike by January 19.

 Laloo Prasad intervened last evening and urged the employees to call off the strike on the assurance that the government would take up all their demands soon after the elections.

 Eager to arrive at a ?respectable solution?, the employees? representatives responded positively to the invitation for talks. ?We are not against the elections. But the Election Commission should try to understand our problems. Instead, it is trying to put pressure on us along with the government,? some employees argued.

 ?We are in a position to conduct the elections without the services of employees from other states,? Bihar chief electoral officer K.C. Saha said. The commission is understood to have roped in a number of teachers, bank employees and central government workers for election duty. 

 The Patna unit of the Corporation Bank Employees? Union has demanded an insurance cover of Rs 20 lakh, besides other allowances, for those deputed for election duty.

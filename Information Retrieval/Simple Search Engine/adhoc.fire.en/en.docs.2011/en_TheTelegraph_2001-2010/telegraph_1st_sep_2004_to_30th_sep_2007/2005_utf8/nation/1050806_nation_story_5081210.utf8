 Mamata rules out return 

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Mamata: Firm

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: Unmoved by the rejection of her dramatic resignation from the Lok Sabha yesterday, Mamata Banerjee today refused to return to the House. 

 I am not going back to Parliament. There is no question of my going back, the Trinamul Congress leader said this morning before leaving for an eye operation.

 The micro-surgery was carried out in the afternoon at a nursing home here. Flying shards of glass had hit her left eye when an alleged CPM-backed group attacked her car in Calcuttas Garden Reach about 10 years ago.

 Stating that her resignation letter was not in order, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee refused to accept it yesterday. He asked her to return to the House and explain her conduct of hurling papers at the deputy Speaker. 

 Seeking to capitalise on the incident to give impetus to her campaign for next years Assembly polls in Bengal, Mamata has sought an appointment with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on Monday to explain her point of view through a memorandum. 

 A team of 10 Trinamul MLAs from Calcutta, led by the leader of Opposition Pankaj Banerjee, will accompany her to Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 The Trinamul leader said the Lefts hue and cry over her conduct yesterday was meant to divert attention from the matter she wanted to raise in the House. The actual issue is illegal infiltration into Bengal and the bogus voters list. 

 She alleged that her voice was being stifled. 

 Mamatas cry echoed in Calcutta where Trinamul MLAs marched to Raj Bhavan in protest against an attempt to gag the voice of their party chief. Led by Trinamul party chief whip Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, 24 leaders courted arrest violating prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC.

 Mamata avoided a response to Chatterjees remark in Parliament today about her not bothering to participate in a House debate last week on infiltration. 

 She also skipped comment on the CPI and the CPMs breach of privilege notice to the Speaker against her over yesterdays incident. Chatterjee told the House today that the notices are under his consideration. 

 At the beginning of todays proceedings, the Speaker made a suo motu statement wondering why Mamata had not participated in the July 26 debate. Members cannot raise the same matter twice in a session and so he had to disallow her from raising the infiltration issue, he explained. 

 Just because one honble member was not present during the discussion in the House does not justify trying to raise a similar issue within a week, he said.

 Atal admits failure on education

 Raipur, April 16 (PTI): Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today admitted failure to carry out reforms in the education system during his tenure while expressing concern over students committing suicide on failing in examinations.

 ?There is need for reforms in the education system. People may ask, when I was the Prime Minister why we failed to undertake reforms. I admit my mistake,? Vajpayee said at the 11th convocation function of Pandit Ravi Shankar Shukla University here.

 He said it would take time to decide the educational set-up in the country and the role of technical education. Lack of resources was also a major obstacle in undertaking reforms, he added.

 The BJP leader said he was worried over the growing incidence of suicide among the student community in the country.

 ?I feel sad to read news reports that students are committing suicide after having failed to secure expected marks in the examinations,? Vajpayee told the gathering.

 Either because of the fear of examinations or of family, students are running away from competition and committing suicide, Vajpayee said, adding ?we should accept the challenges thrown by life?.

 ?One should not accept defeat as people who have accepted defeat cannot do anything in life,? he said.

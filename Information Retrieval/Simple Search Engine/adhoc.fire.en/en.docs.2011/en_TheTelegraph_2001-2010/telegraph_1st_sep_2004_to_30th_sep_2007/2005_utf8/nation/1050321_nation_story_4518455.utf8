 Lakshman rekha reminder to courts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 20: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today stuck to his stand that certain orders passed by the courts tend to disturb the delicate balance of power between the judiciary and the legislature.

 A meeting of presiding officers of legislative assemblies convened by Chatterjee here subtly conveyed to the courts that they should not transgress into areas assigned to the legislature. 

 ?With all respect to the hon?ble Supreme Court, I am of the view that the very principle of separation of powers, which is one of the basic features of our governance, has been violated,? Chatterjee told the meeting.

 The conference fully backed his bid to stop violation of the principle of ?separation of powers, one of the basic features of our governance?, though the presiding officers of the NDA-ruled states did not attend, citing various reasons.

 As many as 22 Speakers attended while six from the NDA-ruled states did not. The BJP-led camp had issued an indirect appeal to them to stay away.

 Addressing the meet, Chatterjee said the issue is not confined to Jharkhand alone. 

 The meeting was called after the apex court advanced the trust vote in Jharkhand and issued a string of directives that many elected representatives felt was an interference in the functions of the legislature.

 The subject in question involves the powers of the judiciary vis-a-vis that of the legislature, Chatterjee said. He added that just as the legislature should not cross the ?Lakshman rekha?, others also should not do so.

 Chatterjee wanted to know that if there was a violation of the order, whether the court would have held the Speaker or members of the legislature guilty of contempt of the Supreme Court. 

 ?Would the judiciary have been able to deal with such a situation? Whether the Speaker could be summoned before the apex court for having exercised his authority under the Constitution of India?? 

 In the Jharkhand case, there was disturbance in the House and ?can the pro tem Speaker be hauled up for contempt for defying the apex court?? he asked. ?We feel the Supreme Court cannot possibly deal with these matters. The Jharkhand tangle was finally resolved by an executive order.?

 Though some presiding officers felt that a presidential reference to the court was in order, a resolution adopted at the end of the deliberations did not contain such a demand.

 Sources said it did not figure in the resolution as there were a few other suggestions and mentioning all of them was not possible.

 Some suggested the need for a constitutional amendment to find a permanent solution to the recurring problem of confrontation between the judiciary and the legislature.

 Another suggestion was to constitute an independent authority to resolve doubts about legislative action. The authority should have the power to review a legislative decision in the event of jurisdictional dispute. The aim is to deny the courts any scope for interfering in legislative functions.

 Others felt that the day (March 9) the court directed the Jharkhand temporary Speaker to convene the House, all presiding officers should have marched to Rashtrapati Bhavan to protest the encroachment into legislative domain.

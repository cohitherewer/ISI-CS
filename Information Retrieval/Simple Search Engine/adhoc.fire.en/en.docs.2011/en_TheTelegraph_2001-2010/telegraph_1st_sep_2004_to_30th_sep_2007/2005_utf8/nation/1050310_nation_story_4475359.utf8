 Winter lesson for youth

Srinagar, March 9: Remember the fable of the ant and the grasshopper? The one in which the ant industriously stocked up for winter all through the summer months while the grasshopper merrily chirped and danced its time away?

 Well, the heaviest snowfall in Kashmir in 40 years has virtually made a grasshopper of young urban Kashmiris who have so far thumbed their noses at overcautious elders for saying it was essential to stock up for a rainy day regardless of modern amenities.

 With the crucial Srinagar-Jammu highway being shut for days on end, the people are now facing an unprecedented shortage of essential items. Foodgrain, vegetables, milk, kerosene, petrol and diesel are scarce because the snow has choked up supplies.

 Nature seemed to have shown up in all its fury to remind lesser mortals that no amount of urbanisation can hold a candle to its might.

 ?We used to start preparing for winter right from the beginning of summer. Tomatoes, brinjals, pumpkins and mushrooms were the vegetables we would dry up and store for winter,? recalled 92-year-old Zaina Begum.

 ?It is not that we are having heavy snow for the first time. I remember roads would remain closed for months. We could not go to cities and towns but we had everything stored up in advance. We used cakes of dried cowdung to light the hearths that provided warmth to the entire family.?

 Zaina Begum said that compared to the young generation that banked on highways and modern gadgets, older people had been more self-sufficient and self-dependent and aware of Nature?s might.

 ?Now you must have fresh vegetables from the market. You must have cooking gas to cook your food. This is all against the reality of winter,? said Muzaffar, a sociology teacher.

 He said the young needed to take a lesson from what had happened. ?In Rome, we must do as the Romans do. It is not possible to fight against Nature,? he said. 

 Nusrat Begum, a 48-year-old housewife, said it was suicidal to ignore the warnings of Nature. ?I plan to make massive preparations this summer so that I am not caught unawares next winter.?

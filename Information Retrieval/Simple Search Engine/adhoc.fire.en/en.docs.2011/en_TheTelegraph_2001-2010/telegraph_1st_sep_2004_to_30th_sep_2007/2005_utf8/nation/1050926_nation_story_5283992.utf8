 Calcutta, Sept. 25: For the Great Andamanese, October will be a month of celebration. 

 While the mainland will begin its festival season, on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands one of the oldest primitive tribes in the world will choose its new king.

 The Great Andamanese, arguably the oldest tribe in the world, inhabits the Strait Island, about 126 km north-east of Port Blair. 

 It has been without a head since April this year after their last king, 80-year-old Jirake, died in a Chennai hospital after prolonged illness. Next month, amid celebrations the tribal council will choose his successor. 

 The tribe, which numbered around 19 in 1976 has grown to 49 despite the December 26 tsunami. Two girls born in the last few months have doubled the joy of its members and the tribal welfare department, desperately trying to save the Great Andamanese from extinction. 

 The birth of a girl means the tribe will grow.

 One of the women in the tribe, Licho, who was pregnant during the tsunami, has given birth to one of the girls. Everyone was overjoyed, said a tribal department officer. 

 The tribe is now busy preparing for the coronation. Like every other similar occasion, there are some candidates but the favourite is Be-Je, 65, the oldest member of the tribe now. He has been taking all the important decisions and will probably be announced the new king very soon, said another department official, who was in Strait Island recently.

 Be-Je is backed by his wife Nu and other women in the tribe, officials said. We have asked them to decide the date and time for the ceremony. We will extend all possible assistance and strictly follow government norms and will not interfere in their internal decisions, said K.C. Ghoshal, the assistant commissioner in the tribal welfare department, from Port Blair.

 Traditional rules specify that only the eldest member of the tribe can lead them as the king and they are a very proud tribe, not keen to break rules in a hurry, Ghoshal said. 

 Moreover, the fact that Be- Je had looked after the tribe even during Jirakes reign further strengthens his claim. 

 Jirake was addicted to his drink, was ill most of the time and unable to discharge his duties. He would always ask his closest confidante to look after the tribe, which we gather Be-Je has done quite well, a senior tribal researcher said.

 After the tsunami struck the emerald isles, most of the tribe members moved to Port Blair, but of late they have begun to stay in a settlement located deep inside the six-kilometre Strait Island.

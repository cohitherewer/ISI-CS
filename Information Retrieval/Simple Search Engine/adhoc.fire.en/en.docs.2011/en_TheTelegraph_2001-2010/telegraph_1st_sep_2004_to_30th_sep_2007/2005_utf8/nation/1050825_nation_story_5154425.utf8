 Mumbai junks choker bags

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, Aug. 24: Unveiling the first policy change to prevent a repeat of the July 26 deluge aftermath, the Maharashtra government today said it would ban the sale and use of plastic bags across the state.

 The green lobby welcomed the decision, but plastic manufacturers said they are thinking of moving court.

 A notification would be issued soon inviting objections and suggestions, if any, within the next 30 days, chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said after a cabinet meeting.

 Urban planners and environment activists had identified the high use of plastic bags as one of the factors that led to the waterlogging in Mumbai after a July 26 cloudburst. The plastic bags had choked the storm-water drains and other outlets that used to carry rainwater to the sea. 

 Traders and hawkers found selling plastic bags would be fined Rs 5,000 or asked to pay an amount proportionate to the stock of plastic bags. Hawkers and traders caught selling plastic bags thrice will face a three-month jail term.

 People found using plastic bags will be fined Rs 1,000. 

 Welcoming the decision, environmentalist Bittu Sehgal said: Plastic bags harm the environment. Use of paper and cotton or khadi bags could be a good option.

 The government had unsuccessfully tried to impose a ban on plastic bags of less than 20-micron thickness in 1998.

 Plastic manufacturers cried foul today. We are being made the fall guys. The decision will render several lakhs of employees in our units unemployed, said Harpal Singh, the president of the All India Plastic Manufacturers Association, the umbrella body of over 6,000 plastic bag makers.

 Official sources said plastic bottles could also face a ban.

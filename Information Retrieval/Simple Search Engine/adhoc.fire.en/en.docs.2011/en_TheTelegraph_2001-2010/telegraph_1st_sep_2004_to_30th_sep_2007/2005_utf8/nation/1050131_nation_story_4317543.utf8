 Anger builds up against Chautala

 GAJINDER SINGH 

 Jind (Haryana), Jan. 30: Dynasty is a dirty word in Haryana. The ?dictatorial? style of Om Prakash Chautala and stories of the ?reign of terror? unleashed by his sons, Ajay and Abhay, have become the primary poll issue. 

 ?They have looted the state. They have institutionalised corruption and legalised crime. Chautala ki kamar kaadh dewange (This time we will break Chautala?s spine),? said a villager here. Similar statements of anger were heard from Ambala to Kaithal, from Jind to Hisar. 

 The Congress, which seems to have hit the comeback trail in the state after almost a decade in the wilderness, is going all out on the issue. Led by Sonia Gandhi, the party has launched a campaign against the Chautala clan, accusing it of unprecedented corruption and amassing huge wealth.

 ?This is not a government but a private limited company that wants to gobble up every inch of land by using muscle and police power, just like the East India Company? It is time to give the Congress a chance to clean Chautala?s corrupt stables,? said an angry Harish Dahiya in Ghanauri. 

 What could spell doom for Chautala?s Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) is that nobody denies there has been development, but they cannot forget that his rule has been characterised by arrogance and unsavoury interference by his family. 

 ?While the state has benefited in terms of infrastructure like cement lanes in villages, more schools and dispensaries, and streamlining of drinking water supply, we cannot forget the favouritism, nepotism and casteism of the INLD government. Even government jobs were put on sale for the common man,? said villager Anil Lal in Balu.

 He alleged that government jobs were given only to Jats and that, too, to those belonging to Chautala?s caste. 

 Chautala denies the allegations. ?The Congress is misleading the people. I am prepared to sit in Opposition but only after the results are declared. It is too early to say I have lost.?

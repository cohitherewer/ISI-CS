 Flak for UPSC disabled avenues

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Union Public Service Commission?s move to identify only seven out of 21 civil services where disabled persons would be eligible to join after qualifying in the UPSC examination for 2005 has drawn flak from activists campaigning for the rights of disabled. 

 This is the first time that the UPSC has shortlisted specific services as eligible for disabled persons qualifying in the examination that precedes entry into the administrative services. 

 The services identified for the disabled persons are IAS, P amp;T, Accounts amp; Finance Service (Group-A), Armed Forces Headquarters Civil Service (Group-B), Audit and Accounts Service (Group-A), Defence Accounts Service (Group-A) and Indian Ordnance Factories Service (Group-A).

 However, Disabled Rights activist Javed Abidi, who is also the convener of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People, has criticised the UPSCs move to bring about a systematic change, calling it a ?practical joke?.

 Earlier, the UPSC was directed following the Delhi High Court?s suo motu action in 2003 to permit two qualified disabled candidates ? Rigzian Samphel and Lokesh Kumar ? to be allocated to the Indian Information Service after they were barred for physical infirmity. 

 In January 2004, the UPSC had also appointed a three-member committee, headed by then secretary, social justice B.S. Baswan to identify civil services where disabled persons qualifying in the UPSC could be accommodated.

 ?We had thought the Baswan panel would have some good work by identifying the services where the disabled could be allotted. But when we saw the advertisement for the UPSC 2005, we were disappointed as it seemed to have been done in a hurried manner without much thought. Except for the police services, I do not understand why disabled persons have been kept out of the IFS, customs, IRS, postal service, civil accounts or trade service,? said Abidi.

 In 2001, a UPSC candidate from Kerala, Mohan Sadasivan, was denied placement as he was hearing-impaired despite passing.

Tremors

 Port Blair (PTI): Scientists at the Central Agricultural Research Institute have identified two salt-resistant varieties, BTS 24 and BTS 28, developed in 2003 along with 32 sodium-resistant strains as sweet cultivar, for shore-based farmers.

 The saline-resistant varieties may help farmers on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a large part of which rendered unfit for cultivation due to high salinity in the soil after the tsunami. 

 The rural economy of the island with a 1,982-km coastline had been primarily based on paddy, coconut and arecanut cultivation. While most of the standing crop have been washed away, a question mark looms on the fate of the agricultural land.

 Porayar (PTI): All affected families in Nagapattinam district will get new ration cards within two days, a top government official has said. The Tamil Nadu government has sent 33,000 new family cards for this purpose. ?So far, 1,152 affected families have been issued new cards,? rural department secretary Shantha Sheela Nair said on Friday.

 Chennai (PTI): Faced with increasing demands by fishermen to repair their boats, the army has decided to deploy more teams to assist them. ?Three engineering teams are to be deployed for the repair of out-board motors and boats,? the army said in a press note on Saturday. The demand was made at a meeting between army officials and trawler owners. 

 Chennai (PTI): Prominent classical and playback singer K.J. Yesudas will organise a two-day yagna from January 18 for those affected in the tsunami disaster. ?We feel that the mental agony of those who survived should be addressed to. Hence, we are organising this,? Yesudas and, the chairman of a private chit fund Gokulam Gopal, said. The singer said the sarvamatha akhanda yagna (all religion yagna) would be performed by five Brahmin priests from Kerala.

 New Delhi (PTI): Two quakes of moderate intensity occurred 

in the Andaman and Nicobar islands on Saturday, the Met department said. A 5.2 

intensity aftershock was recorded off the west coast of Great Nicobar Island in 

the early hours, followed by another quake measuring 5 on the Richter scale, in 

north Andaman.

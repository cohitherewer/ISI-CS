 Bofors case stay to check papers

 New Delhi (PTI): The trial in the 15-year-old 

 Bofors case was stayed by Delhi High Court on Friday as 

 time was sought to ascertain the evidentiary value of certain 

 Swiss documents in the absence of originals.

 Justice R.S. Sodhi stayed the trial proceedings against the Hinduja brothers ? Srichand, Gopichand and Prakashchand ? and Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors after additional solicitor-general B. Dutta said he needed time to ascertain if the documents placed on record were capable of being considered for framing charges.

 Dutta?s submission is contrary to the CBI?s 

 affidavit filed in the court. The CBI said: ?The said documents 

 are admissible in evidence as per Section 166-A of the Code 

 of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).?

 Hindujas? counsel, Ram Jethmalani, sought dropping of cheating charges against them on the grounds that the CBI did not have original documents to prove the case. 

 The court issued a notice to the CBI on Bofors? plea for discharge and fixed March 4 for hearing.

 Court comes to woman?s aid

 Allahabad (PTI): Allahabad High Court 

 has directed a Muslim man to pay maintenance money to his 

 estranged wife, saying Muslim women cannot be discriminated 

 against.

 Justice S.N. Srivastava said the Constitution mandates that there cannot be any discrimination on the basis of caste, creed or religion and directed Islam to pay Rs 1,000 per month to Fatima. 

 Hindu law provides for maintenance in such cases and Muslim women are also, therefore, entitled to it under the Constitution, Justice Srivastava said. The court could grant interim maintenance despite the fact that there was no such specific provision under the Muslim law. 

 ?The court cannot be a mere passive pronouncer of judgment unconcerned with the actual effective implementation,? Justice Srivastava said.

 A Ghazipur trial court had earlier granted a sum of Rs 1,000 per month as interim maintenance to Fatima but Islam objected to it on the grounds that there was no such provision in the Muslim law.

 NRI doctor suspended

 Toronto (PTI): Canada has cancelled the 

 licence of a doctor of Indian origin who was found guilty 

 of countersigning prescriptions for US patients without 

 examining or meeting them.

 British Columbia-based Daljit Singh Herar was suspended for two years and fined $4,000 for the offence, which gave his patients access to cheaper medicines. Herar was also charged with failure to keep proper medical records and providing false information, a media report said.

 with advanced medical facilities and speedy evacuation of 

 wounded and ailing soldiers.

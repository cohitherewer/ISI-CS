The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Now, a disaster authority

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: After an all-party meeting on the tsunami called by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the government announced the setting up of a National Disaster Management Authority.

 There are also plans to put an early warning system for natural calamities in place, home minister Shivraj Patil told reporters at the end of the two-and-a-half-hour meeting this morning.

 A bill to set up the disaster management authority will be tabled in Parliament next month, he added. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar were also present to take questions. 

 Patil said the Centre has announced a committee to suggest the best technology available for a warning system. India will be ?part and parcel of all international efforts? on tsunami forecasts, he said, adding that the government has not thought of being part of any existing warning system for the moment. It would much prefer to take the lead in forming a new grouping.

 However, exchange of information with countries that have tsunami warning systems will be pursued.

 Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal has invited Indian and international scientists to a conference on January 21 to give their views on the best way to put together a warning system.

 Although the Centre did not give details of the disaster management body, officials said it would be multi-disciplinary and autonomous. Scientists, technocrats and experts from all fields will be invited to be a part of it.

 After the 2001 Gujarat quake, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had convened a similar all-party meeting following which he had announced the setting up of a national committee on disaster management.

 Mukherjee said the UPA government has accepted 64 of the panel?s 97 recommendations, including setting up a cabinet committee on disaster management.

 Today?s meeting was attended by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and BJP bigwigs, including Vajpayee, party chief L.K. Advani and senior leaders Jaswant Singh and Sushma Swaraj. All parties were well represented.

 Manmohan Singh, who has just returned from the Andamans, shared his experience with the other leaders at the meeting, which was free of the usual acrimony.

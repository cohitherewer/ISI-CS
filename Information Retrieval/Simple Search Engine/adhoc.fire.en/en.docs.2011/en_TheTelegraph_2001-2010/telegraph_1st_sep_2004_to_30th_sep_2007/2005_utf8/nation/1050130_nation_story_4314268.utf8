 Gutka axe after adulteration find

Mumbai (PTI): The Maharashtra food and drug administration 

has issued directives to various departments to cancel the licenses of gutka manufacturers, 

wholesalers and retailers in the state, acting on a report about the presence 

of magnesium carbonate in gutka.

 ?We have issued directives to various departments to cancel the licenses of gutka manufactures, wholesale dealers and retailers in the state following a major finding of gutka and paan masala containing carcinogenic material,? said food and drug administration commissioner A. Ramakrishnan on Saturday.

 The department raided about 20 premises in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane district during the week and found pouches of gutka containing magnesium carbonate. The food and drug administration found in its analysis that gutka contained magnesium carbonate besides tobacco and areca nut. The food and drug administration has also issued a stern warning to all wholesale and retail dealers that their licenses would be cancelled if they tried to sell the adulterated product in the state.

 Maharashtra had earlier banned the sale and distribution of gutka. However, the manufacturers moved the Supreme Court, which lifted the ban while admitting their petition in August, 2004.

 5 Maoist rebels killed

Hyderabad: Five Maoist rebels were killed in an exchange 

of fire with security forces on Saturday at Bodepalli village in Warangal district, 

240 km from here, reports our special correspondent.

 District police superintendent Stephan Ravinder said the security forces were on a combing operation for landmines in Tadvai Mandal when they chanced upon the rebels huddled in a conclave. Over 60 Naxalites of the Pratighatana group were holding a meeting in a forest when the commandos landed there, the official said.

 ?Five rebels were killed in the firing while 55 others escaped, leaving behind some weapons and a huge kitchen store. It appears the rebels were holding a two-day-long meeting in the jungles,? he said.

 The clashes between the Maoists and security forces have spiralled during the last two weeks ever since the rebels walked out of peace talks with the state authorities. They were protesting against the killing of over a dozen comrades by the security forces and failure of the authorities to keep the truce pact.

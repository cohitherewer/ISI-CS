 Jittery Laloo hopes to build poll bulwark

 Laloo Prasad, Paswan

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Laloo Prasad Yadavs camp is worried that the National Democratic Alliance could pip the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar this time.

 Sources close to Laloo Prasad said their leader will ensure that the RJD does not repeat the mistakes of the last elections that saw a hung Assembly and eventual dissolution of the House. Wrongful ticket distribution was identified as the main mistake.

 The sources admitted that their chief had bigger problems to reckon with. A senior MP from central Bihar listed three: lack of issues, a defensive campaign and the inability to enlarge the support base beyond the Muslim-Yadav combine.

 Added to these was the fear that the proposed third front the Lok Janshakti Party was trying to cobble could further erode Laloo Prasads turf.

 Sources in the RJD said that in tandem with the Congress they were trying to hard-sell a formula to LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan.

 The formula is: if he allies with the RJD and the Congress, an elected leader from the single-largest party would become chief minister, one from the second-largest party would be deputy chief minister, while one from the smallest party could be the Speaker.

 But Paswan is apparently still cold to the idea and insists that the chief minister will not be a member of the Yadav family.

 It was pointed out that while the NDA, comprising the BJP and the Janata Dal (United), had already hit the road on the planks of misgovernance and central rule being an extension of Laloos jungle raj, the RJD was being unable to counter the charges in kind.

 The RJD sources said Paswans third front ? comprising his party, the CPI (ML), the CPI and the Samajwadi Party ? would this time eat into their votes rather than the NDAs. They acknowledged that though Paswans legislators defected lock, stock and barrel to the NDA, their flight would not dent his base severely.

 He has a six per cent following in most constituencies and if that is tagged on with the votes of the others, his front should win 30 to 35 seats and most of these will be from our quota, said a source.

 Dal (U) sources agreed with this perception and claimed that their slogan You brought us close to the winning post last time, see we race past the post this time was already consolidating upper-caste votes in the NDAs favour.

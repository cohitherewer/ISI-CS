 Natwar shakes off Sonia sting on shuffle-eve

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Congress is surprised Natwar Singh is continuing his show of defiance despite Sonia Gandhi saying she was angry the partys name was misused to collect payoffs in the Iraqi oil-for-food scam.

 Sonia had yesterday said her family had only a close working relationship with Natwar, not a personal one. She had also made it clear no one would be spared if the Volcker allegations turned out to be true.

 A senior Congress official summed up the Sonia-Natwar equation saying: The Congress president will always back individuals, but this does not mean she will back each and every deed of theirs.

 Few in the Congress, however, expect Natwar to take the hint and quit the cabinet altogether. He is now a minister without portfolio.

 Sources said if the Prime Minister and Sonia wanted him out, they would not have retained him. They said the real test of Natwars holding power would come when Sonia shuffles the Congress Working Committee and decides to drop him as a member.

 There is pressure to carry out this exercise before the national plenary takes place in Hyderabad in January 2006.

 Natwar today took a potshot at the Prime Minister at an interactive summit, a day after Sonia declared she was one hundred per cent with the government on getting to the bottom of it (the Volcker allegations).

 Asked his view on the vote on Irans nuclear programme, Natwar reportedly iterated the Centre must take a very careful look as any move to take it to the UN Security Council would create a very big mess. Pressed on how India should vote, he said: Ask the PM who holds my portfolio.

 For the record, the Congress evaded a direct answer on whether Natwar should quit the cabinet.

 AICC general secretary Ambika Soni said: Whatever the Congress president has said is crystal clear. She is hurt and extremely angry that someone used the name of the party to make money and wants to get to the bottom of the truth to punish the guilty.

 Spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said: She (Sonia) clearly said it made her angry. As for those who should remain in the cabinet or outside is not within the purview of the spokesperson.

 Congress and government sources said the much-awaited cabinet shuffle would most possibly happen on Friday or Saturday. The government sources added the mega shuffle ? which the Prime Minister was keen on for a while ? would wait for another day.

 In the present shuffle, the coal ministry is almost certain to go to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha while sports and youth affairs will go to either Gurudas Kamat or Suresh Kalmadi. The Prime Minister is expected to keep external affairs.

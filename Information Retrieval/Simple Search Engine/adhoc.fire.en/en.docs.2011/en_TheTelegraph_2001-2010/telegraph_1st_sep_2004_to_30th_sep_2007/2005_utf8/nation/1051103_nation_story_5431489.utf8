 Sangh cool to Advani quest for lifeline

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: For BJP chief L.K. Advani, an NDA victory in Bihar is the crutch he needs to postpone his scheduled exit by the year-end.

 The RSS, which has given him several marching orders, would not help precipitate any situation that might delay his departure. This political reality has confused Sangh cadre in Bihar. The Sangh, insiders say, is not as enthusiastic and helpful in Bihar as it would normally have been.

 The BJPs campaign managers overtly deny such rumours, but privately agree that the Sangh is not so enthusiastic any more.

 The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad has supported us. They have been sending workers. But yes, the kind of enthusiastic support we used to get is not available any more, a state BJP leader said.

 Party general secretary Arun Jaitley dismissed the suggestion as outright rumour-mongering. We have spoken to them. There is no problem.

 State RSS leaders are, however, lukewarm in their response. The Sangh is not supposed to work for any political organisation, said prant pracharak for Bihar Anil Thakur.

 We are a social and cultural organisation. Our cadre are free to support any political party. In fact, some workers have even voted for the Rashtriya Janata Dal. People have a wrong notion about the Sangh. They do not understand our functioning and that is where the confusion lies. Among our cadre, there is no confusion, Thakur said.

 But an RSS worker said: It is wrong to say that the RSS does not help during elections. In fact, we were stationed in Chhattisgarh for six months before the Lok Sabha polls in 1998. Our area of work was Haryana. I belong to Haryana. 

 The RSS helps the BJP in a very systematic manner, from sensitising the voter to actual poll management. It has a say in everything ? from candidate selection to poll strategy. In fact, in Bihar this time, the RSS has been unhappy with the selection of some candidates.

 They objected to the candidate in Katihar. They do have a say. I find it surprising that they are completely isolating themselves from the process, a senior BJP leader said.

 The RSS leadership in Bihar skirted the issue. We dont know anything about what happens in Delhi. What are you suggesting ? that we will support the RJD? We support nationalist parties and the BJP is a nationalist party.

 But the Sangh does not work in elections. The only time we passed a resolution against a political party was in 1977 against Indira Gandhi, Thakur said.

 Advani is, meanwhile, aggressively campaigning in the state. He is addressing four meetings in every phase of the poll. What is new about this? asked BJP leader C.P. Thakur. He always works very hard.

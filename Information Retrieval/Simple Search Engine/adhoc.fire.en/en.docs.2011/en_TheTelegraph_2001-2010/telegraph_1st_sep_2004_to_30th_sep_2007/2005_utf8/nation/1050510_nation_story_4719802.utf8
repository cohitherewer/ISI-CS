 Hurriyat

 Islamabad May 9 (PTI): Pakistan today asked the moderate and the hardline factions of the Hurriyat Conference to reunite saying that a solution to Kashmir was ?nearer than ever before?.

 Jalil Abbas Jilani, the foreign office spokesperson, said ?it is very important that unity comes as soon as possible? as the ?entire Hurriyat leadership is moving in that direction?. 

 He hoped that the Hurriyat will be ?united? as it was earlier.

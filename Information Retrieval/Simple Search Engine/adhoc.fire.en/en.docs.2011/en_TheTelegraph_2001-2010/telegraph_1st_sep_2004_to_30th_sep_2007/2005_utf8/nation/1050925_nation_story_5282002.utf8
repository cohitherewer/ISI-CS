 Censorship storm brews

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: A row is brewing over censorship, with filmmakers questioning the proposed guidelines for entries to film festivals and national film awards. 

 The information and broadcasting (I amp;B) ministry set up a committee on February 2 to formulate the guidelines. 

 Film personalities Shyam Benegal, Rahul Roy, Manmohan Shetty, Jabbar Patel, Asha Parekh and D.V.S. Raju were appointed to it along with Prof. Dipankar Gupta and ministry official Afzal Amanullah.

 The panel held a series of meetings, with the last one on July 7 when the members made some suggestions.

 Some of the proposals were:

 All Indian and foreign 

 films would be eligible for exemption from certification 

 in all film festivals, including those with ticketed shows

 There would be a redress 

 mechanism for entries that are rejected

 The ministry would retain 

 the right to exempt films from censor board certification. 

 There could be three main grounds for denial of exemption:

 The film is a threat to 

 national security

 It could cause a law and 

 order problem

 It offends human sensibilities. 

 However, some committee members raised objections and all three suggestions had dissenting notes attached.

 The members were expecting the ministry to circulate the minutes and carry the debate forward. But they now reveal that this was not done and the draft guidelines were prepared without taking into account the dissenting notes.

 The draft guidelines, the members say, include the grounds for denial of exemption. But the suggestions to throw exemption open to all films and have a redress mechanism for rejected entries have not been accepted.

 According to Roy, the main fear is that concrete guidelines will never come out and the ministry would follow an ad-hoc policy. They will grant exemption to some and reject the others. This is dangerous. We are insisting on liberal guidelines because we want certain institutional safeguards against government control and censorship, he said.

 I amp;B minister Jaipal Reddy could not be reached for comment. Joint secretary (films) Amanullah was out of town.

 Filmmaker Anand Patwardhan has written to Reddy, saying: All of us who helped to bring down the previous government because of its communal and undemocratic ideology expected that at the very least the new government would not go back on the freedoms we had wrested from the previous regime. Not only should film festivals be free of censorship, the CBFC regulations themselves are in grave need of being liberalised.

 Rakesh Sharma, the maker of the acclaimed documentary on the Gujarat riots, Final Solution, said the proposed policy is deeply disturbing. 

 Any film can be banned from film festivals because it offends sensibilities, he has said in a letter to the minister.

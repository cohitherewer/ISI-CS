 ?God? with a guitar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 4: If Mark Knopfler is close to God, he will have his share of devotees at his feet tomorrow.

 About 10,000 people are expected to crowd in at the MMRDA Grounds in Bandra tomorrow to listen to the former frontman of Dire Straits to do the walk of life. A similar crowd is expected to greet him in Bangalore at the Palace Grounds on March 7.

 Though concert organisers DNA Network did not specify the sales, the speed at which the tickets, priced at Rs 2,500 and Rs 1,500, are moving, proves that not many of his fans in India are in dire straits ? at least to watch him. But this was expected, as India has been a hub of Knopfler lovers, including a good percentage of the youth.

 ?The response has been tremendous from the young audience,? said a public relations person from Bangalore.

 Knopfler, who knows of his Indian fans, also has a special place for India in his heart. The guitarist, who was a journalist and lecturer in his former life, says India has much to offer. 

 ?India offers a broad spectrum of philosophy and spirituality to those seeking a Shangri-La state of mind,? he said recently on his first tour of the country. His latest album, too, is titled Shangri-La. 

 He added that it was ?thrilling? to know he had a ?huge fan following? in India.

 Knopfler formed the band Dire Straits in 1977 with his brother David, but launched his solo career in 1990. This, he has said, has steered clear of ?gimmicks?.

 But then he never had to look cool. His fingers on the guitar were good enough.

 At the MMRDA Grounds tomorrow, ?flying lights? will be used for the first time in a concert in India. The lights will be suspended 40 feet from the ground and will lead to a ?four-finger? effect. Knopfler, the ?Sultan of Swing?, will bring 10 tonnes of personal music equipment, including 36 guitars.

 Mumbai will also bring over people from across the country for a dekko of their ?god?. One would have been Kanishka Chatterjee, a final year engineering student from Calcutta, who had booked train tickets to Mumbai to attend the concert but could not make it.

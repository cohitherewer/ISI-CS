 Hope for good health 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 22: There is good news on the health front for the people of western Orissa.

 The Western Orissa Development Council (WODC), which had cancelled the memorandum of understanding (MoU) with GSL Trust of Rajahmundry for two medical colleges in Bolangir and Rourkela last December, has approached the Hyderabad-based MNR Education Trust to resume the process.

 The proposed medical colleges at Bolangir and Rourkela were chief minister Naveen Patnaik?s sops for western Orissa in the run-up to the Assembly elections last year.

 The council had signed the agreement with GSL Trust for the two medical colleges in January 2004. But it later cancelled the MoU following inordinate delay by GSL in starting work on the projects. The trust had agreed to set up a 100-bed medical college and hospital at Bolangir and a 150-bed one at Rourkela.

 Sources in WODC said MNR Education Trust has over 30 educational institutions in Medak district, including six medical and nursing colleges.

 Chairman of the trust M.N. Raju visited Bolangir and Rourkela last week to inspect the infrastructure available there. Bolangir district collector Narayan Chandra Jena, a tehsildar and a senior official of WODC accompanied him.

 Sources said Raju was prepared to go ahead with the projects provided the government agreed to certain conditions like obtaining no-objection certificates from the Indian Medical Council for the proposed colleges and transferring 40 acres of land in the name of the trust.

 Raju also visited the proposed site for the medical college near the Government Hospital in Rourkela and expressed satisfaction over the location.

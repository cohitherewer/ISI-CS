 Left secret salvo

 New Delhi, July 8: The Left today raised the pitch of its protest against the recent Indo-US defence agreement and alleged that the Centre had moved in a surreptitious and secretive way to strike the deal, reports our correspondent.

 The Left parties said the agreement was struck behind their back, and added that the decision to sign it was in line with the tactics of the Vajpayee government and violated the common minimum programme. 

 The Vajpayee government had started signing military and defence pacts with the US. This agreement will only further Indias entry into Americas orbit, said CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, however, rejected the criticism, saying: We are following an independent foreign policy; the framework agreement to widen Indo-US friendship in the important sector of defence is also part of this policy.

 He said it was the Congress government of P.V. Narasimha Rao that had, in 1995, initiated the policy to widen relations with the US. Through this framework agreement, we have expanded and widened this relationship Mukherjee declared.

 The defence minister, who briefed Karat and CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan on the agreement yesterday, said his aim was to plug technological gaps in the defence sector through co-production and transfer of technology between India and the US. The Left is not satisfied with the explanation.

 The agreement, while encouraging India to purchase American technology, does not include the removal of American sanctions against India obtaining this technology from other countries, Karat said.

 When the defence minister left for the US, he told us his visit was an exploratory visit, Bardhan said. He did not inform us he had any such plans of signing this agreement. There is no mention of strategic or military collaboration with the US in the common minimum programme.

 The Left feels the agreement could jeopardise Indias ties with China.

 The agreement is a part of Americas strategic goals to contain China by using India as a counter-balancing force. Coming so soon after the historic handshake between the Prime Ministers of India and China, and with progress being made to settle border disputes with China, this agreement is against the strategic interests of India, Bardhan said.

 The Left parties also believe that by signing the agreement, the defence minister has endorsed Americas stand on pre-emptive warfare without UN sanction.

 The agreement, while talking of India and the US jointly participating in multilateral operations of common interest, does not mention under whose auspices these operations would be conducted.

 One only needs to look at Iraq to know that by multilateral operations, the US also means operations which do not have the support of the UN. On the one hand, the government is anxious to enter the Security Council of the UN, on the other, it does not mind signing such a document, where there is no mention of seeking UN support before embarking on operations, Karat said.

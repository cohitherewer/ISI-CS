 Patna, March 14: The heady cocktail of Raj Bhavan and the subcontinent?s willow power spilled onto the carpeted interiors of a plush hotel here with the organisers going in a tizzy over the beneficiaries of the India-Pakistan veterans? match slated for tomorrow.

 Amid the confusion, senior players of the two sides, led by Kapil Dev and Abdul Qadir, checked in and left for field practice at the Moin-Ul-Haque Stadium, the venue of the charity match.

 Initially, the proceeds from the match were to go to the survivors of the tsunami but today the polio eradication plan, supported by Unicef and the state government, emerged as the one to benefit from the ?goodwill? generated by the presence of the cricket stars. The match will now be played for the ?Freedom from Polio Trophy?.

 Governor Buta Singh?s son Arvinder, the man behind the show and promoter of the Delhi-based NGO Freedom, tried to explain the proceeds confusion. ?The proceeds from the match will definitely go to the tsunami victims. Our organisation works in all fields. We realised that eradication of polio was a good cause to be clubbed with the event. There is no confusion,? he said.

 Former allrounder Madan Lal appreciated the efforts of the governor?s son and said the cricketers of India and Pakistan were committed to eradicate polio from their countries and would go to any extent for the cause. ?A unified effort is required and we also need the media?s support for it,? he said.

 The players were closeted for most of the day, not opening up before the waiting reporters. 

 Raj Bhavan has been extra generous in providing ?logistical support? to the organisers of the match, perhaps because the governor?s son himself is the centre of attention. Several official vehicles, some displaying the National Emblem, were seen doings rounds of the hotel and the stadium.

 Special commandos moved with Arvinder while other police personnel guarded the hotel. The players are moving in two deluxe buses.

 The Indian side includes Javagal Srinath, Venkatapathy Raju, Vijay Dahiya, Syed Kirmani and Nikhil Chopra, among others. The stars from Pakistan include Ejaz Ahmed, Aamir Sohail, Waqar Younis, Saeed Anwar and Manzoor Elahi.

 Till last reports, sale of tickets had not crossed the 5,000-mark for a stadium which can seat more than 30,000 spectators. ?We expect the sales to pick up at the last moment. Tickets will also be available at the stadium,? one of the organisers said.

 Unicef representative Bijaya Rajbhandari said the event will boost the special drive being undertaken for the eradication of polio in Bihar. 

 ?Polio is a major health issue in India and Pakistan, where the virus still has a home. This international event will raise awareness on the polio eradication programme. It will help people understand the importance of vaccinating every child without missing a single round till polio is eradicated,? he added.

 Left consolation

 Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 22: The Congress-led United Democratic Front suffered a drubbing in a Lok Sabha byelection with the Left candidate defeating its nominee by 74,200 votes, reports our special correspondent.

 Left nominee Pannian Raveendran of the CPI won the Thiruvananthapuram seat, bagging 390,324 votes ? about 51 per cent of the total votes ? while V.S. Sivakumar of the Congress polled 316,124 votes. 

 The BJPs former state chief, C.K. Padmanabhan, ended up a distant third with just 36,690 votes and lost his deposit.

 The defeat has put a question mark on chief minister Oommen Chandys continuation. Most Opposition leaders demanded his resignation, saying after the defeat, he had no moral right to continue in office. Chandy, however, ruled out any such possibility soon after the result, saying the outcome of a Lok Sabha byelection did not mandate the resignation of the ministry.

 Czech redress for detained Indians

 Brussels (INEP): The Czech Republic has 

 been ordered by the European Court of Human Rights to pay 

 Rs 3.7 lakh each to two Indians as compensation for unlawfully 

 jailing them for two-and-a-half years on charges of aiding 

 illegal immigration.

 Balbir Singh and Bakhschisch Singh were arrested in the Czech Republic in November 1996, where they were residing lawfully, and were prosecuted for assisting others in crossing the border illegally.

 But the European court in Strasbourg awarded the compensation 6,500 Euros ? 5,000 Euros for non-pecuniary damage and 1,500 Euros for cost and expenses ? to the two.

 The court said on April 9, 1998, a Prague court had sentenced them to 21 months? imprisonment. After serving their terms, they were detained, pending deportation from August 11, 1998, on the ground that it was impossible to deport them immediately as they did not have passports.

 The two applied for release and refugee status twice but their appeals were dismissed.

 They were released on February 11, 2001, and were subsequently issued travel documents enabling them to leave Czech territory.

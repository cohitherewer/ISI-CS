 Nuclear prize for Iran vote

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: The US has argued that it is in the international communitys interest to bring Indias nuclear isolation to an end, since Delhi has agreed to take on key global non-proliferation commitments. 

 Americas pro-India stand came yesterday, on the eve of the crucial Nuclear Suppliers Group meeting in Vienna, being held to discuss if the groupings laws should be amended to let Delhi acquire civilian nuclear technology.

 The US referred to not only Indias strong commitment to protecting fissile material and nuclear technology but also its recent vote against Iran to prevent a theocratic state from acquiring nuclear weapons capability.

 Washington also hinted the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal would get the crucial approval from the US Congress before President George Bush visits India early next year.

 By the time of President Bushs visit to India in early 2006, we plan to be in a position to ask Congress to make the necessary changes to put this agreement into effect, under-secretary of state Nicholas Burns told the Asia Society in New York.

 We believe it is in the international communitys interest that New Delhis isolation be brought to an end.

 Burns, chief US negotiator on the nuclear issue, starts a three-day visit to India tomorrow. His reference to Indias vote against Iran at the IAEA might, however, prove embarrassing for Delhi.

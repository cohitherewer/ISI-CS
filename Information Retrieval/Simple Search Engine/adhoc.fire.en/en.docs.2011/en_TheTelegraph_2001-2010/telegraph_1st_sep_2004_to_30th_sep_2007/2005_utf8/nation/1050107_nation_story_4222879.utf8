 Indus talks hope sinks

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: The talks on the Baglihar project between India and Pakistan seemed to be on the verge of collapse at the end of the third day today.

 A breakthrough looks unlikely though both sides have spoken about continuing their discussion tomorrow, thereby extending the scheduled three-day meeting by another day.

 If no agreement is reached tomorrow, Pakistan may go ahead with its threat of involving the World Bank as a neutral observer ? as provided in the Indus Water Treaty ? to find an amicable solution to the latest dispute between the two neighbours.

 Asked whether this would affect the ongoing peace talks, a senior Pakistani official said: ?Since it (provision to call in the Bank) is already part of the treaty, I don?t see how it will have any negative impact on the peace process.?

 India?s public posture is to continue discussions because a ?number of technical issues are involved? in the project. But in private, the establishment in Delhi indicated that it would not run away if Islamabad involved the ?third party? in the bilateral dispute.

 India interprets the Pakistani opposition to the project as more the outcome of political necessity than technical reasons. Delhi feels the dominant ?Punjabi lobby? in Pakistan is bent on scuttling the project that has the potential to help develop Jammu and Kashmir and make life a little easier for Kashmiris.

 But Indian officials seemed confident of having a ?watertight case? and thus might not be averse to the idea of Pakistan going to the World Bank, in what appears to be a clear shift from Delhi?s earlier position of total opposition to outside help.

 The worry in Delhi perhaps was of setting a precedent, which Islamabad might later use in the Jammu and Kashmir issue.

 The Indus Water Treaty, an umbrella agreement on the rivers that the two countries share, was signed between the two sides several years ago.

 Pakistan claims the Baglihar dam India is building on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir violates the treaty. India dismisses the charge. Pakistani officials had asked India to alter the project?s design in line with the criterion laid down in the treaty.

 But India, which shared copies of the design and data with Pakistan, maintained that the construction in no way violated the treaty guidelines and that it was undertaken to help the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

 ?We will now have to go back and report to our government in Islamabad,? a senior Pakistani official said after tonight?s discussions.

 Bandit legacy lives on

Chennai, April 15: Veerappan?s elimination has not ended sandalwood smuggling in Tamil Nadu, the seizure of 124.10 tonnes worth Rs 14.75 crore has shown.

 The sandalwood was seized during a 12-day raid on a factory in December, state forest and environment minister R. Vaithiyalingam revealed on Wednesday. 

 This was the first major haul of sandalwood since the forest brigand was gunned down in October 2004 at the end of a 20-year-old hunt.

 The raid was conducted after the company exporting sandalwood and red sanderswood powder had failed to renew its licence from the forest department to hold up to a certain quantity of sandalwood ? 71 tonnes in this case.

 The recent raid was ordered following a similar operation by the revenue intelligence department in December. Just before the company was to export 13 tonnes of sandalwood and red sanders powder, the department had seized 40 tonnes of red sanderswood and some sandalwood chips, Vaithiyalingam said. Two persons were arrested. 

 This prompted a stock audit by the Tamil Nadu forest department during which the recent seizure was made, the minister said. 

 Although Veerappan?s elimination has come as a huge relief, the forest department also has to deal with other problems like excessive damage and destruction by illegal felling of trees and encroachment of forest land.

 A background note on the department?s performance for the last financial year said ?poverty leading to destruction of forests and destruction of forests due to poverty? had led to a vicious cycle in the past.

 This trend has been reversed by taking up massive afforestation works under the Tamil Nadu Afforestation Project involving local villagers through the joint forest management since 1997-98. The project, assisted by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, has succeeded in the last seven years in ?reforesting? around 4.57 lakh hectares.

 Now the bank has allotted Rs 567.42 crore for the second phase of the project, which is to be implemented over eight years from the financial year 2005-06, the forest minister added.

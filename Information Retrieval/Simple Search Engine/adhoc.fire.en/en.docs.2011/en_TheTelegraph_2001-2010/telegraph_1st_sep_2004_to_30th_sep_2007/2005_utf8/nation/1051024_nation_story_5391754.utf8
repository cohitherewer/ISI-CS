 Uma foes close ranks

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Oct. 23: The Madhya Pradesh BJP has launched a campaign to isolate Uma Bharti after her abortive bid to dislodge chief minister Babulal Gaur.

 Gaur, state BJP chief Shivraj Singh Chauhan, organisational secretary Kaptan Singh Solanki and co-ordinator Kailash Joshi have joined hands to try and make the rebel MLAs fall in line. The idea is to rob Uma of their support when the second round of the power struggle is played out, probably between November 18 and 26.

 Through the day, the state BJP played up Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh spokesman Ram Madhavs statement that Umas criticism of Suresh Soni, a senior RSS functionary, amounted to an attack on the Sangh itself.

 Party legislators in Bhopal were summoned and briefed. Clippings of Madhavs statement were faxed to those away in their constituencies. The message was clear for the MLAs, many of whom have a Sangh background: do not back the wrong horse.

 Today, Gaur was in the Jhabua region bordering Gujarat, where he met several party MLAs. The chief minister had earlier undertaken a similar trip to Jabalpur region with Kailash Joshi. Gaur dangled the carrot and waved the stick, saying he would be glad to listen to all party legislators but would not tolerate indiscipline.

 The Sanghs harsh words seem to be having a sobering effect on several pro-change legislators. Contacted to comment on Madhavs remark, many MLAs loyal to Uma declined.

 The sadhvi, however, made a feeble attempt to clear her name. Speaking from Delhi, she said: For me, the Sangh is not an individual. The Sangh is an ideology whose advance has been nurtured through the tapasya (devotion) of lakhs and lakhs of swayamsevaks.

 She described her letter to Sangh chief K. Sudarshan, in which she had attacked Soni, as a communication between a daughter and a father which had unfortunately reached the media.

 In Bhopal, her supporters were still trying to keep their flock together. They came out with a parallel set of ministers in charge of districts, etc. Gaur, Chauhan and Joshi, however, said their appointees were the only credible ones.

 Mulayam doors open to all castes 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chitrakoot, Sept. 10: What Rahul Gandhi tried eight months ago, Mulayam Singh Yadav is trying now.

 In January, the Amethi MP had held a youth training camp in this small Uttar Pradesh border town to explore ways to expand the Congress base. Today, the chief minister kicked off a similar exercise, declaring his Samajwadi Party was keen to embrace backwards and upper castes under a broad socialist umbrella.

 It is wrong to identify a party with one or two caste groups. Samajwadi Party has grown beyond that. It will embrace all and work for all from under the broad socialist umbrella, he said.

 Making it clear his party wanted to expand its base beyond Muslims and backward castes, Mulayam Singh said the doors were open to all castes and communities.

 Chitrakoot was the most favourite place of Ram Manohar Lohia. It is also a pilgrim centre for Hindus. Lohia nurtured his socialistic dreams in this ambience. We are lucky to have inherited a place which is a confluence of unique political and mythological tradition, he said.

 Mulayam Singh and most of his cabinet members are camping here for a three day training session at the Lohia Sabhaghar on the Ramayan Mela grounds, where Rahul had held his camp too.

 More than following in Rahuls footsteps, the Samajwadi Party could be trying to go one up on rivals Bahujan Samaj Party and BJP which have a support base here. The two parties have been alternately winning the constituencies in this region.

 With Mulayam Singh announcing his latest all-embracing philosophy, the leaders who appeared to be calling the Chitrakoot shots were from the upper castes. General secretary Amar Singh was in the forefront as were Ravti Raman Singh --- the Allahabad MP whose son Ujjal Singh was made minister recently --- and Raja Bhaiyya.

 At an informal session with small traders, the partys new-found interest in upper castes was made clear. In an effort to woo them, Mulayam Singh declared his government would soon announce a package for them.

 The small traders, from Vaishya caste groups, have traditionally been BJP backers. You keep a watch on what we do. You wont be disappointed when you see that we promise what we do, Mulayam Singh said.

 Amar Singh expressed distaste at the Congress barbs over his attempts to woo investment for the state. Samajwadi Party has now gone national. It has shown it is capable of attracting investors on its own. It is committed to turn Uttar Pradesh into Uttam Pradesh. Even if it means we have to go alone, he said.

 Over 2000 party workers from Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar, apart from Uttar Pradesh, attended the meet. Experts were called in to give lessons in party ideology to suit the changed economic scenario.

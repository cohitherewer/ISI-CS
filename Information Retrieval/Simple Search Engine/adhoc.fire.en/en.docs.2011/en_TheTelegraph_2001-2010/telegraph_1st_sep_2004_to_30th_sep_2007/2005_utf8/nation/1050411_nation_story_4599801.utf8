 Casting couch row reaches UK

 London, April 10 (PTI): Weeks after the casting couch controversy erupted on television, British Asian actresses have alleged that they were harassed and asked to extend sexual favours to make a career in Bollywood.

 When Chelsea-based Jiah Khan was spotted by Mahesh Bhatt ? the director visited her mother Rabya, a former Indian actress in London, and told her Jiah had what it takes to become a star? she put her studies on hold and flew to Mumbai to play a shy girl in Zaroorat. Now she is back, saying ?there was a lot of harassment?. 

 ?I would check out my costume and be alone with someone who would then try it on me... I was told that there are thousands of actresses like me and I was replaceable.? She, however, maintained that Bhatt did not harass her.

 Jiah flew to Dubai last year for the shooting. ?I was harassed and people tried it on, so I walked out,? she told the Times of London. ?In one scene, I had to wear a swimsuit and jump around. I expected the filming to be professional, but some of the crew were whispering to each other and laughing. It made me feel uncomfortable. It was vulgar.?

 She said she saw some actresses sitting on the laps of producers.

 Monica Riche, a 28-year-old British actress whose parents are Indian, said one casting director arranged a meeting at 10.30 pm in a hotel. When she suggested his office would be more appropriate, she was not considered for the part.

 In another interview she offered to do a screen test, but was asked by one writer: ?What else can you offer me??

 ?If I had gone to bed with him I would probably have got the role,? she told the Times.

 Another British Asian woman, who did not want to be named, said a famous Bollywood actor had promised to make her big. ?It meant that he wanted to have sex with me. I said no, and he said: ?Look, god meant men and women to have fun?.?

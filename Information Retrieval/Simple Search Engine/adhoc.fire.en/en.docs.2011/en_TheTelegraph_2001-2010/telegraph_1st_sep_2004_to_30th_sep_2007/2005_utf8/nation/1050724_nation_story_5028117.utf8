 BJP lashes out on pipeline

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, July 23: Waking from the daze of the Advani-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh stand-off, the BJP today decided to play Opposition again.

 The party attacked the Centre on a range of issues, providing an indication of its agenda for the monsoon session of Parliament, which begins on Monday. Party chief L.K. Advani, who is also leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, recovered from his isolation to crack the whip against leaks of internal discussions to the media.

 The issues on which the BJP criticised the Manmohan Singh government include the Prime Ministers remarks on the India-Iran gas pipeline project, militant attacks, price rise and the increase in cases of rape.

 By playing up the Hindutva issues ? such as the Ayodhya attack, illegal immigration, the purported Salman Khan tape and the grave internal security situation ?the party hopes to please the Sangh bosses as well as corner the government.

 The BJP lambasted the Centre for its doublespeak on the India-Iran gas pipeline and ? a day after the Left had voiced the same fears ? expressed doubts whether the project would get off the ground.

 Former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh said: It (the Prime Ministers remarks in the US on the pipeline) amounts to cutting the feet of an important project of the government. We doubt whether the project will see the light of day.

 Manmohan Singh had told The Washington Post on Wednesday that he is realistic enough to realise that there are many risks (associated with the project) because, considering all the uncertainties of the situation there in Iran, I dont know if any international consortium of bankers would probably underwrite this.

 But? we desperately need the supply of gas that Iran has, he had added.

 Jaswant Singh said the BJP parliamentary party executive will make a statement on the Prime Ministers US visit only after he makes a statement in Parliament.

 The party meeting expressed concern at the alleged weakening of internal security ever since the United Progressive Alliance assumed power and claimed that the country has been facing unchecked social and political disorder. The Maoist threat, it said, has grown during the past year to become an all-India problem.

 Aiyar clears air

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said talks on the proposed Iran-India pipeline would continue and the fate of the project was in no way linked to the nuclear agreement signed by Manmohan Singh and the US President.

 He said the talks on the pipeline were now at a preliminary stage and the proposed project was fraught with terrible risks.

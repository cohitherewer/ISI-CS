 Priyas confessions

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 23: After both Houses voted to expel the Money-for-Posers XI, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had a few confessions to make.

 One, he had skipped lunch. Preoccupied with rustling up the numbers, he just hadnt found the time to even grab a sandwich.

 Two, he hadnt been too confident about getting the motions (one in each House) for expulsion through.

 Three, no whip was issued to ruling alliance MPs. That was how Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi wanted it.

 Four, it was the Janata Dal (United)s support for the motions that, ironically, united the ruling alliance MPs.

 Five, the tainted XI, suspended till a final decision, were not asked to attend todays proceedings, as had been made out by some in the government.

 Most of the 11 huddled in Parliaments central hall, watching the proceedings on TV over snacks and chai-coffee. Their curious colleagues later approached the waiters to find out what they had been discussing.

 Till last night, it was believed the ruling side would issue a whip. Das Munshi explained why it wasnt. The issue involved the dignity and honour of the House and the will of the members should be spontaneously reflected and not under duress.

 While Das Munshi had taken care of some Opposition parties, notably the Dal (U), Akali Dal and Telugu Desam, he was anxious about the BSP because three of its members were among the 11. But minutes before the vote, he received a message from BSP chief Mayavati that her MPs would vote for expulsion.

 The deputy leader of the BJPs parliamentary party, V.K. Malhotra, threatened to demand a division, but as Das Munshi readied his MPs to defeat the move, Malhotra threw in the towel.

 History was made. But Das Munshi had a sixth confession: he didnt particularly want to remember the moment. The session ended on a sad note, he said.

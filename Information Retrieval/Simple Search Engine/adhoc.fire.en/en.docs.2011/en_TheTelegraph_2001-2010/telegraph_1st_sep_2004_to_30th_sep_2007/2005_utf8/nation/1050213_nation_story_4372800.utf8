 Valley safety net

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: In London to sell Jammu and Kashmir as a tourist destination, chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed is having trouble convincing newly-elected municipal councillors back home that the Valley is not as unsafe as they think.

 Militants have killed three councillors since the recent civic elections, prompting others to hand in their papers out of fear. The National Conference, which has won a majority in Srinagar Municipal Corporation, yesterday threatened mass resignations if all its councillors are not provided security.

 Anxious that the security issue does not spiral into a controversy, sources said Mufti has directed that one personal security officer be provided to each councillor who wants protection. However, police officers are not convinced of the threat to the councillors.

 ?We are undertaking a comprehensive review of the personal security mechanism and will augment forces where required to provide a sense of security,? said deputy inspector general, Srinagar, H.K. Lohia, who had argued against granting personal security to the candidates to ensure that the new generation of leaders is not dependent on it. 

 ?The idea of holding the civic polls was that the councillor should actively serve in his domain. If you isolate them by providing security, we will be back to square one,? argued an officer.

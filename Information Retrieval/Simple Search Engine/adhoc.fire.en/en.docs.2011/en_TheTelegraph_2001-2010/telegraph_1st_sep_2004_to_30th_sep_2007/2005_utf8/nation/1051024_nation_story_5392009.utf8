 Death FIR on tech school VC 

 JOY SENGUPTA

 Ranchi, Oct. 23: A first information report under non-bailable sections has been filed against the vice-chancellor of the Birla Institute of Technology in connection with the death of a student.

 The names of five students also figure on the FIR on the death of Amit Lal, a third-year student of information technology, on October 19. 

 The FIR was registered against vice-chancellor S.K. Mukherji when a five-member special committee formed by Raj Bhavan was touring BIT to look into the reasons behind the mysterious deaths of students. Six such deaths have been reported over the past three years. 

 Amit, son of bank employee P.P. Lal, was found dead in a hostel room. The management had called it a clear case of suicide but the family felt that the student was murdered.

 Ranchi SSP Anil Palta said Mukherji has been accused of destroying evidence and hiding facts. The victims father had sent a letter to the police, holding Mukherji and some students responsible.

 Mukherji said he was not aware of any case against him. I have not received any official intimation from police, he said.

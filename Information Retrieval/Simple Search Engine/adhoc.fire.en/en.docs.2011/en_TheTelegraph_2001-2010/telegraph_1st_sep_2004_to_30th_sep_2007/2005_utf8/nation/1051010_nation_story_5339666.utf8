 Advani relives Ram yatra

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Palampur, Oct. 9: On a visit here, Lal Krishna Advani is entitled to speak of the past ? of his and the BJPs glory days that started in this Himachal town.

 The future, however, is something else ? only one thing is clear, his departure as BJP president. There will be no vacuum in the party, there would be no disheartenment even after my resignation, he said.

 Sixteen years ago, at Palampur the BJP adopted a resolution that demanded handing over of Ram Janambhoomi to Hindus, firing the party into an Advani-led movement that would see its Lok Sabha tally jump from two to a number where it could form a government in Delhi in a coalition in less than 10 years.

 The BJP involved itself with the Ram temple movement in 1989 after giving detailed thought, considering the situation at that time, he said.

 This was considered a turning point in Indian politics and for the growth of the Bharatiya Janata Party.

 The movement is still going on and I believe that a grand temple would be constructed at the site with the agreement of both the communities, Advani added at a party meeting here amid shouts of Jai Sri Ram.

 The BJP president said his Somnath-Ayodhya yatra was still incomplete as the Ram temple had not yet been built in Ayodhya. 

 Later, on the sidelines of the meeting, he said: In the past also I had quit the post and the party ran smo-othly.

 Two and a half months away from the scheduled date of stepping down, the future now casts a long shadow on the past for Advani.

 The Supreme Courts judgment on dissolution of the Bihar Assembly has given him, his party and its allies an opportunity to dispel uncomfortable thoughts about the future and concentrate on the present. 

 Advani demanded the resignation of home minister Shivraj Patil, directly responsible for the Bihar fiasco since governors touch base with his ministry. 

 This judicial indictment has literally blackened the face of the UPA government, Advani said.

 On one hand, there was an earthquake yesterday in South Asia that caused great damage and loss of life in the region, and on the other hand there came a bigger legal earthquake in India the day before yesterday.

 The UPA government has been given a deadly legal blow by the Supreme Court and the Bihar governor is refusing to own responsibility and resign while the great Laloo Prasad is calling this indictment his victory. They are all strange beings.

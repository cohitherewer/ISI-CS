 Allah?s grace, says first driver 

 Muzaffarabad, April 4 (Reuters): The man chosen to drive the first bus linking divided Kashmir says his selection for the job was a blessing from god and he is thrilled to be playing a part in history.

 Raja Pervez Khan, from the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), says he has no long-lost relative on the Indian side, but he is proud to be driving the vehicle that will reunite families after decades of separation.

 ?I never thought that I would be the one to drive the historic bus. It is because of Allah?s grace that I have been chosen,? Khan said in PoK, hands raised in prayer.

 The bus service, one of the most concrete signs of improving ties between the neighbours, will link the town of Muzaffarabad, in PoK, to Srinagar, in Indian Kashmir, 170 km away.

 Khan, who has been a bus driver for 16 years, was chosen this weekend from nearly a dozen candidates, after a driving test and an interview. He will drive the bus from Muzaffarabad, up to the Line of Control.

 Khan?s 29 passengers will get down from his bus at the village of Chakothi, cross the LoC and get on a bus on the other side to complete their journey to Srinagar.

 A bus from Srinagar will bring the same number of people to Muzaffarabad.

 The resumption of the bus service, broken off after the first India-Pakistan war in the 1940s, has delighted Kashmiris on both sides of the divide, including Khan. ?I?m going to reunite separated families, this is the real happiness for me,? he said. 

 Thousands of Kashmiris have applied to make the journey and many hope the new bus will be the first step to a real solution of the Kashmir dispute. But not everyone is happy to see the bus. Terrorist groups warned people last week not to use the bus, saying the service was not in the interests of their struggle. 

 Khan, however, showed no sign of worry about security.

 The last man to drive the bus in 1947 said he, too, would love to visit Srinagar and the Indian side of the Kashmir valley. ?I?m very weak now and do not have the strength... to drive a vehicle, but I would definitely love to visit Srinagar,? Ghulam Hussain Shah, 90, who lives near Muzaffarabad, said.

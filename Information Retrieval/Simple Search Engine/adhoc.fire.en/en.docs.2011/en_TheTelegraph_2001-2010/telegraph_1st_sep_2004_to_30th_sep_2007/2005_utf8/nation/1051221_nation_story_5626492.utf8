 Govt paves quota pitch

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: The government today introduced in the Lok Sabha a Constitution amendment bill that seeks to reserve seats for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students in unaided educational institutions amid hectic efforts to ensure its smooth passage in both Houses.

 Piloted by HRD minister Arjun Singh, the 104th Constitution amendment bill excludes minority institutions from its purview.

 The BJP has objected to the exclusion, saying mala fide institutions might take cover under the minority clause and not reserve seats for Dalit and tribal students. 

 The Left and the RJD also voiced their reservations. V. Radhakrishnan of the CPM said minorities ran 93 per cent of the institutions in Kerala while the RJDs D.P. Yadav urged the government to include the socially and educationally backward classes in the ambit of reservation.

 A top government source, however, said CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and RJD chief Lalu Prasad were keen to have the bill legislated. Karat met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi last night and stressed that the bill should be passed in this session.

 Although the UPA has a comfortable majority in both Houses ? 343 of the effective strength of 521 in the Lok Sabha and 136 of the effective 235 in the Rajya Sabha ? its strategists are leaving nothing to chance for tomorrows vote in the lower House. 

 To be passed, the bill needs votes of two-thirds of the MPs present in each House. Whats more, 50 per cent of the members will have to be present.

 Government sources said the Prime Minister and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee spoke to Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa. Mukherjee also reportedly spoke to Mulayam Singh Yadav and Nitish Kumar, the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, while parliamentary affairs minister P.R. Das Munshi was in touch with floor leaders of all parties. The sources said an encouraging sign was the division within the NDA.

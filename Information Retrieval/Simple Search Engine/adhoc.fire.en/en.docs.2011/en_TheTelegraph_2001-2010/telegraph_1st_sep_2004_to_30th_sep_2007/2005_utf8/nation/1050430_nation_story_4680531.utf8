 DD news sours Speaker cuppa

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, April 29: When Somnath Chatterjee settled down to watch Doordarshan?s news bulletin on Wednesday with his morning cup of tea, he was jolted by a rude shock.

 The Lok Sabha Speaker had on Tuesday ensured the House finished the day?s agenda despite the turmoil created by the NDA. But the anchor on his TV screen said: ?Despite Somnath Chatterjee adopting a tough posture, no business could be transacted and the House was adjourned?.

 After the anchor was done, a reporter carried on from Vijay Chowk (near Parliament) ? ?today also no business is likely to be transacted?.

 A fuming Speaker summoned DD?s director-general Naveen Kumar and its news head Amitabh Chakravarty and gave them a dressing down. ?This kind of attitude by a public broadcaster is not tolerable. So long as I am here, I will not allow denigration of Parliament,? Chatterjee is understood to have told them. 

 He also accused them of committing breach of Parliament by giving false news. ?If you commit such faux pas again, consequences will be severe.?

 Sources said the Speaker, however, advised the officials not to make anyone a scapegoat and take action against either the anchor or the reporter. They should induct professionalism into the organisation instead.

 During the last winter session, K.S. Sharma, the CEO of Prasar Bharati, had been reprimanded for taking question hour off air without permission from the chair and telecasting a cricket match.

 The bitter note that marked Chatterjee?s Wednesday morning came back today as the NDA boycotted the all-party meeting he had convened this morning.

 The Speaker requested the NDA ? a letter was addressed to leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani ? to participate in the proceedings, especially a debate on the finance bill. But it stuck to its stand. 

 The all-party meeting was aimed at finding a way out of the impasse that has resulted from the Opposition?s decision to stay away from the House for three days.

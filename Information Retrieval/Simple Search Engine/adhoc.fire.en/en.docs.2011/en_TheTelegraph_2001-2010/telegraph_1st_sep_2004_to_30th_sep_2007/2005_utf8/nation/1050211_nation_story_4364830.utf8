The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 East high on Wipro job menu

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 10: Information technology major Wipro Technologies has decided to jack up its manpower intake from the eastern region in the campus recruitment sessions scheduled to begin later this month.

 ?The eastern region will be our area of focus,? said Bijay Sahoo, vice-president and global human resource head of Wipro, adding, ?we will hire more students from the eastern region than we did last year.?

 ?We have recruited 500 engineers from engineering colleges in the eastern region, including 150 from Orissa, in the past nine months. It will go up in the coming campus recruitment session,? he said.

 Wipro?s move follows the decision to set up a software development centre in Bhubaneswar. In December last year, the company had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Orissa government to set up a software development and BPO services centre, which will employ about 1,500 people. 

 Sahoo told The Telegraph that he was highly impressed with the talent available in the east, especially in Orissa. ?There is absolutely no doubt that the eastern region has one of the best IT talent pools. The governments here are also very enthusiastic,? he said.

 The state has an impressive talent pool of 5,000 technical graduates from 40 engineering colleges and technical institutions. 

 Wipro depends on campus recruitment drives to meet about 50 per cent of its incremental manpower requirement, while the remaining recruitments are made through walk-in interviews and lateral entries.

 While the company follows the industry standard of adding 35 per cent of incremental intake every year, Wipro this time has decided to increase it to over 50 per cent for the eastern region. ?For each of our local centres we look for local people,? Sahoo said. 

 For the development centre here, the company has given its Oriya software engineers elsewhere in the country the option to migrate to the state. ?This is being done to maintain cultural continuity of the company,? he added.

 Work on the first phase of the centre will start after April. It will be completed in two years and cost about Rs 200 crore.

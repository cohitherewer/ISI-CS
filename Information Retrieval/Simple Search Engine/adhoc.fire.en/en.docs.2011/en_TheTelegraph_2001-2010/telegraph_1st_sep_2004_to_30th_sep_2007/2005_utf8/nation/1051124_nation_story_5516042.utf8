 Delhi let him die, cries village

 JOHN MARY

 Alappuzha, Nov. 23: Maniappan Raman Kuttys village today exploded in anger at the Centres failure to prevent the Indian drivers murder by the Taliban.

 We swapped terrorists for the daughter of Mufti Mohammed Sayeed (former Union home minister). The authorities wasted 48 hours in the case of poor Maniappan, a villager said at Chingoli in Alappuzha, echoing the thoughts of many.

 The chief ministers office rang up Maniappans home around 2 pm, informing the family of the 34-year-olds death.

 Villagers and relations themselves broke down as they made weak efforts to console the drivers wife Bindu and his aged parents. His mother Mani, a cancer patient, kept shouting her sons name.

 Why did you go to this dangerous place? My child is gone, she wailed.

 Maniappans elder son, a seven-year-old Class III student, sat bewildered while relatives took care of his toddler brother, aged two.

 The 48 hours the abductors had given was enough to secure the release of our boy. Unfortunately, the government could not even start negotiations before the deadline. They would have acted swiftly if he were a VIP, said Pushpan, a neighbour. They could have suspended the road work and tried for his release.

 The murdered mans father, Raman Kutty, a heart patient, said rather stoically: Now whats the use in blaming anyone? Hes gone.

 Maniappan, the familys breadwinner, had taken up the job with the sole objective of renovating their small, tiled house, wife Bindu said. My husband went there in the hope that hell get more money to meet the expenses for renovating our house. I had cautioned him.

 A relative was dismayed that E. Ahmed, minister of state for external affairs and a Keralite himself, had failed to deal with the issue seriously. He said Ahmed should have cut short his trip to Pakistan and returned home to start negotiations.

 The body is expected to reach Kerala on Friday for the last rites. Some villagers plan to blockade the politicians and officials when they come to the village to condole with the family. We wont let anyone in, said Prasad, leading a small band of angry youths.

 Residents have called for a hartal tomorrow.

 Arrangements have been made to bring the body at the earliest to New Delhi and then to Kochi by Air India, chief minister Oommen Chandy told a hurriedly called press conference.

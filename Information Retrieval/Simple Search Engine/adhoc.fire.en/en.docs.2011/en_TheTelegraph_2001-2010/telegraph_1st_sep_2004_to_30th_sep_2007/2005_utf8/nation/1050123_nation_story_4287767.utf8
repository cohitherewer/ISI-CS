 Mutt turns fortress for seer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kalavai (Tamil Nadu), Jan. 22: The ashram has become a fortress.

 Inside, Jayendra Saraswati ? the man of god charged with murder ? remains isolated from most, emerging only for brief ?darshans?. Outside, private security guards frisk every visitor.

 Devotees are told to switch off their mobile phones. Not even a camera is allowed in. If any suspicious-looking visitor enters the premises, the guard sends a warning message through a sophisticated handset. Reporters are banned, unless someone manages to sneak inside.

 Local residents say they are hardly allowed a glimpse of the acharya and only ?close devotees and associates? are being permitted to enter.

 Police have also beefed up security around the ashram after some unknown miscreants, seen moving in a Tata Sumo, tried to enter the premises, sources said.

 If the Kalavai ashram, now home to the Kanchi mutt?s senior pontiff, has turned into ?Jayendra fortress? a day after the chargesheet in the Shankar Raman murder case, some of the other accused must have felt the prison bars close in even more.

 Raghu, the brother of jailed junior pontiff Vijayendra Saraswati, and . Sundaresa Iyer, the mutt?s manager, were this morning served detention orders in Chennai prison under the Goondas Act, normally invoked against dangerous anti-socials and which entails a year?s detention without trial. Those detained under the act cannot seek bail in court. Only a review committee, headed by a former high court judge, can hear their appeal.

 Iyer and Raghu, the third and fourth accused in the case, were booked under the act for having ?disturbed public place tranquillity? as Raman was murdered on the premises of the Varadaraja Perumal temple, official sources said. Eight other accused have already been booked under the act.

 The developments came even as some details from the 1,873-page chargesheet trickled out. The sources said several women witnesses figure in the chargesheet. Among them are the woman from Srirangam, Usha, alleged to have had long early-morning telephonic conversations with Jayendra Saraswati, and film star and former TV anchor Swarnamalya, whose proximity to the mutt finds mentions in one of Raman?s letters.

 Tamil writer Anuradha Ramanan, who had alleged that the seer had once ?attempted to outrage her modesty?, is also cited as one of the witnesses.

 The sources said Chennai-based builder Ravi Subramaniam, who has turned approver, has made ?crucial disclosures?. Ravi is believed to have revealed that two days before the murder, Jayendra Saraswati had talked about the ?last letter? from Raman, purported to be a ?final notice? to the seer, and how he ?did not want any such letter from Shankar Raman any more?.

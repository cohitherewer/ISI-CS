 Soni back as face of Congress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, March 4: Sonia Gandhi today put Ambika Soni back in control of the Congress?s media affairs as the party struggled against the poor publicity over the Jharkhand and Goa political upheavals.

 On the face of it, the return of Soni, who headed the media department for over two years till the general elections, may be termed a routine appointment. The post was vacant after Girija Vyas was recently appointed the chairperson of the National Commission for Women.

 But the decision?s political import can hardly be missed. Sonia had fielded Soni yesterday to contain the damage caused by reports that the Congress chief had blessed Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi?s invitation to Shibu Soren.

 Soni, merely a general secretary for the last eight months, kickstarted the firefight by asserting yesterday that Sonia?s standing instruction to party leaders was for them to adhere to the Constitution.

 Soni has had differences with leaders such as Arjun Singh, M.L. Fotedar and Ajit Jogi ? all of whom were poll and post-poll strategists in Jharkhand and Bihar. Today?s appointment may be the Congress president?s way of distancing herself from the actions of these leaders .

 Jail for lottery conman 

 Vijayawada, Aug. 12: Kola Krishna Mohan, who took banks and individuals for a ride in November 1998 with the claim of winning ?12.5 million in the Euro lottery, was today sentenced to three years in jail and fined Rs 25 lakh, says our special correspondent.

 Mohan had generated a bond certificate for a term deposit of ?12.5 million allegedly issued by the Midlands Bank, London, which he discounted with the Andhra Bank for an initial payment of Rs 17 lakh.

 However, the certificate was declared fake when it was sent for verification, sending shivers through more than 25 people who had lent him approximately Rs 7 crore.

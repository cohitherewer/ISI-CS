 Sewa pulls out of Gujarat projects

 New 

 delhi: The Self-Employed Womens Association 

 (Sewa) said on Friday it was pulling out of 20 projects 

 in which it partners the Gujarat government, reports our 

 correspondent.

 The Narendra Modi administration 

 has threatened to replace it in the project called Jeevika 

 for earthquake-affected people, alleging financial irregularities 

 that, it said, had been found after a special audit. 

 After meeting finance minister P. Chidambaram, Sewa founder Ela R. Bhatt announced the decision to withdraw. 

 Renana Jhabvala, Sewas national coordinator, said the association had sought the Centres intervention in its tussle with the state government. She said the Gujarat governments intention was to discredit Sewa and Bhatt.

 Ifad, a UN agency, is funding the seven-year project routing money through the Centre to the state.

 Civic hope with man on mission

 Pandian: Road drive. Picture by Uttam Kumar Pal

 Rourkela, Feb. 27: A civic crusade is on in Rourkela, thanks to a babu.

 Before 30-year-old V. Kartikeya Pandian took over as additional district magistrate and secretary of the Rourkela Development Authority (RDA) in August last year, encroachments were a common sight on the streets of the once-beautiful city.

 Hawkers occupied the pavements while several market complexes remained vacant. Chaos reigned on the streets in the absence of administrative intervention.

 Pandian, a postgraduate in agriculture from Pusa Institute in New Delhi, has changed all that. With able help from Sundargarh district collector S.K. Vasisth, and other officials, he took the lead in demolishing about 500 illegal shops. The roads were cleared and encroachments on government lands removed. 

 The result was there for all to see ? smoother traffic movement and better-looking roads.

 The Rourkela administration?s eviction drive started at the Chhend Housing Colony and Gandhi Road. At the Chhend complex, owners had rented out their houses to businessmen for shops, which occupied a portion of the adjacent road. 

 After taking charge, Pandian served an eviction notice on the offenders and demolished the shops. Similarly, encroachers on Gandhi Road were asked to clear the mess within a stipulated period. They were later relocated in three market complexes. 

 Besides traders and residents, policemen too have been asked not to encroach upon government land. Recently, 19 police officials were evicted in this connection.

 ?We haven?t brought any revolution here?we are just doing our duty,? says Pandian, complimenting his team of officials and Vashisth for their efforts. 

 Pandian may not call it a revolution, but people on the streets feel the changes are indeed remarkable. ?He has worked wonders for Rourkela,? says Sadanand Sahoo, a shop-owner at Panposh Road. 

 With the eviction drive yielding desired results, Pandian now wants to turn the RDA into a financially sound organisation. The development authority had suffered for years due to poor management. An ill-utilised loan of Rs 6 crore, taken from Hudco six years ago, has ballooned to a financial burden of Rs 20 crore. 

 Three months ago, Pandian handed over the collection of toll tax and parking fees for buses to police homeguards in a bid to prevent pilferage. As a result, the RDA?s toll collection jumped to Rs 1.2 lakh from Rs 60,000 three months ago. Besides, the total revenue collection went up to Rs 80 lakh this month from Rs 20 lakh a couple of months ago.

 Taking stern and seemingly unpopular steps also comes easily to Pandian. Last week, he locked the RDA?s office after he came to know that more than 80 per cent of the employees had not turned up. ?They can wait,? Pandian had said.

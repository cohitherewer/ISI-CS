 Laloo fights for Sonia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 9: Laloo Prasad Yadav today made it clear in Parliament that he bore Sonia Gandhi no grudge though he was upset with some senior Congress leaders following the setback in Bihar.

 The railway minister rushed to the Congress chief?s defence when Janata Dal (United) leader George Fernandes made disparaging remarks about her during his speech on the motion of thanks to the President?s address. 

 Fernandes?s remarks in the Lok Sabha gave the Rashtriya Janata Dal president and his partymen ? fuming at the turn of events in Bihar after the Assembly polls ? a chance to shout back at their adversaries in the National Democratic Alliance and the BJP. 

 Laloo Prasad made it clear that his position as a Union minister is not going to deter him from launching a frontal attack on the NDA. 

 The spat took place when some members of the ruling United Progressive Alliance referred to the coffin scam during Fernandes?s tenure as defence minister. He retorted, saying some leading members of the ruling alliance were behind the Tehelka revelations. Fernandes said he has written to the Prime Minister asking for an inquiry into the Tehelka revelations.

 Laloo Prasad also objected to repeated references to Sonia. ?In a television interview, Fernandes had said Sonia will meet the same fate as her mother-in-law.? This was a direct threat to Sonia, he said.

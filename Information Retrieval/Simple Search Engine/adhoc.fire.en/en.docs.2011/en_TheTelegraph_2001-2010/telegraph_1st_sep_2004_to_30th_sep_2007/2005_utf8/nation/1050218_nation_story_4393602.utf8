 CBI raids on whistleblower

 New Delhi (PTI): The CBI has carried 

 out raids on a suspended IAS officer who blew the whistle 

 on a teacher recruitment scandal in Haryana.

 The CBI claimed in a release that assets valued at Rs 80.33 lakh have been traced to Sanjeev Kumar and his family members after raids on 16 places. The agency said it had earlier found documents suggesting investments of Rs 1.62 crore, taking Kumar?s total alleged assets to Rs 2.42 crore.

 Kumar, against who the agency had filed two corruption cases, had shot into the limelight after the Supreme Court took note of his petition and ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the appointment of teachers.

 The CBI said the officer had acquired disproportionate assets valued at Rs 46.17 lakh, adding that most of the wealth linked to Kumar was acquired between April 1998 and March 2003.

 The assets include Rs 9 lakh in bank accounts, a Rs 30-lakh farmhouse in the name of his mother who had no known source of income and several flats and plots, the investigative agency said.

 Warrant against wife seller

 Ahmedabad (PTI): A Jamnagar district 

 court has issued search warrants against a man and his family 

 members for allegedly selling his wife in Rajkot district 

 of Gujarat.

 Based on a complaint by the victim?s father Nagjibhai Tapubhai, the chief judicial magistrate in-charge issued the warrants on Wednesday and ordered the accused to be present on February 19.

 The complaint stated that the woman was remarried and sold off by her in-laws to a man in Rajkot for Rs 1 lakh.

 Councillors step down

 Srinagar (PTI): Three more newly elected 

 councillors resigned on Thursday following threats by militant 

 organisations to kill those who had taken part in the Jammu 

 and Kashmir civic elections. Six councillors have stepped 

 down so far.

 Nissar Ahmad Dahal and Shabir Ahmad Khanday of the Shopian municipal committee in Pulwama district and Aisha of the Beerwah municipal committee have announced their resignation.

 Jet flight row

 New Delhi (PTI): A passenger has 

 approached Delhi High Court for a directive to police to 

 register a case of criminal negligence against Jet Airways 

 for allegedly endangering his life by operating a flight 

 to Mumbai from here under adverse weather conditions on 

 December 20, 2001. Sharma accused the airline of operating 

 the flight though all other flights were cancelled on that 

 day. 

 Ransack strike

 Pune (PTI): Several teaching and 

 non-teaching staff of most colleges abstained from work

 students allegedly ransacked the office on February 15. 

 Surjeet breather

 Mumbai (PTI): A court on Thursday 

 exempted CPM leader Harkishen Singh Surjeet from personal 

 appearance in a defamation case filed by actor Anupam Kher 

 but ordered him to appear on March 15 without fail. Surjeet 

 sought the exemption on medical grounds.

 Haryana vote

 New Delhi: Counting of votes for 

 the Haryana elections, earlier scheduled for February 27, 

 has been brought ahead by four days to February 23, Election 

 Commission sources said on Thursday. This has been done

 The Commission also announced that repolling will be held 

 in 262 polling stations in Bihar and 28 in Jharkhand on 

 Friday.

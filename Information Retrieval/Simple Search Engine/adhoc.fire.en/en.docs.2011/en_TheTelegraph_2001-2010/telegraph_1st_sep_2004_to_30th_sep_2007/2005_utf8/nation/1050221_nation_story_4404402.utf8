 Sanskrit cheques get due

 New Delhi, Feb. 20 (PTI): The Delhi consumer forum has ordered a compensation of Rs 12,000 to a person whose cheques were not honoured by a bank as they were filled up in Sanskrit.

 ?To deprive the consumer of his constitutional right of mentioning the amount if the cheque is in Sanskrit is not only a charlatan act but amounts to grossest deficiency in service and violation of the official languages act,? the president of the Delhi State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, J.D. Kapoor, and member Rumnita Mittal said.

 S.N. Panigrahi, who had an account with the Andhra Bank, Green Park branch, had been signing and filling up cheques in Sanskrit since 1987. In 1991, a bank official objected to five UTI Master Plus cheques of Rs 5,000 each in Sanskrit and declined to honour them.

 The forum found that the amount in figures was written as Rs 5,000 in all the five cheques. In words, it had been mentioned as panch sahastra matra. On the official?s insistence, Panigrahi had clarified its meaning in Hindi as well.

 Terming the bank?s conduct as ?highly deplorable and capricious?, the commission said: ?If there was difficulty for the official to decipher the meaning of panch sahastra matra, he could have got it clarified from a person having adequate knowledge of the language.?

 The forum said as the amount was mentioned in figures, the refusal showed that the official was ?illiterate? or ?was adamant in not honouring the cheques. Such an attitude smacks of arbitrariness?. 

 It rejected the bank?s contention that it was well within its right to reject the cheques as the language used in official communication should be either English or Hindi as per the official languages rule. ?This rule is not applicable as it relates to communication between the state and central governments,? the forum said.

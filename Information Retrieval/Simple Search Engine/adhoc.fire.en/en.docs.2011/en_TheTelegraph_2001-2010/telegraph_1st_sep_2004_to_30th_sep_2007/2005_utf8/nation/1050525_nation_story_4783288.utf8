 Beginners brush with Lady of the Lake

 Ranthambore, May 24: Weak, as L.K. Advani claims? Not in tiger territory.

 The Prime Ministers cavalcade today ventured up to five feet of Lady of the Lake, one the tigresses in the Ranthambore national park. Not bad for a first-timer.

 The disappearance of Ladys fellow cats from other parks had brought Manmohan Singh on an overnight stock-taking tour to Ranthambore. 

 After a 20-minute drive into the national park, the vehicle carrying the VVIPs came across the tigress. With the Prime Minister today was his wife Gursharan Kaur.

 Both were apparently happy to have luckily spotted the animal, officials said. Singh later said this was the first time he had seen a tiger under such circumstances.

 The Prime Minister, who spent about an hour at the national park on a learning mission, also met forest officials who explained their problems, particularly regarding their efforts to keep people away from the reserve. 

 Singh spent around 20 minutes with them.

 Yesterday, during discussions with wildlife officials and experts, Singh had said all is not well with the way the national parks are being managed. Disappearance of tigers is a matter of national concern, Singh said.

 The Prime Minister today described the situation as problematic. 

 He stressed that more effective means were needed to tackle the problem. The future of the big cat was in our hands and if we do not act, we will be doing irretrievable damage, Singh said.

 The Prime Minister said he heard the problems and suggestions on his interactions with forest officials and assured them that sincere action would be taken after the task force set up by him presents its report in two months.

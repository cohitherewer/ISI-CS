 Date set for Dimple suit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dimple Eric

 Chandigarh, July 20: A 28-year old womans lawsuit against her parents, who had thrown her into a hospital garbage pit after birth, got rolling today with a Punjab court setting August 24 for hearing.

 My biological father was 

 supposed to reply to my suit today but has asked for a fresh 

 date, said Dimple Eric, who was rescued and brought 

 up by a woman doctor.

 I want the hearing to start soon. I want people to understand how cruel the world is to newborn girls in a region where sons are preferred.

 Sulochana Karanjia: Saviour

 Dimple has sued father Sukhdev Singh and mother Harbans for Rs 10 lakh in a Tarn Taran court for abandoning her to die. 

 Attacked by stray dogs in the garbage pit of the Tarn Taran civil hospital, Dimple was saved by Dr Sulochana Karanjia, medical superintendent of the nearby St Marys Hospital.

 Now an employee with Reliance Telecom, Dimple continues to stay with Dr Karanjia while her husband, Jude Eric, runs a finance firm in Chandigarh.

 After Sukhdev and Harbans came to know she was alive and well looked after, they had tried to assert their parental rights.

 My parents approached my foster mother and sought me back. But when I went to visit them in Gorakhpur (where the Singhs had moved), they treated me very shabbily.

 They wanted me to break my engagement to Jude and marry someone else. They tried to control my life. I dont want to face them ever again, said Dimple, who stayed away from court today. 

 I want them punished severely.

 The court granted Sukhdevs appeal for time to find legal help before filing his reply.

 Inspired by Dimple, a 30-year-old woman, Shweta Bhandari, too, has sued her Delhi-based parents for allegedly planning to kill her after birth. Like Dimple, she wants to teach her parents a lesson.

 According to Shweta, she was smuggled from her cot, hidden in a bundle and taken to safety to her maternal aunts home in Hardwar by grandmother Brahma Rani, who feared the newborns father might kill her. 

 Shweta was the third girl born to Ramesh Chander Rana, a retired army major.

 It was only after my marriage six years ago that I was told my uncle, who had brought me up, was not my father, Shweta said.

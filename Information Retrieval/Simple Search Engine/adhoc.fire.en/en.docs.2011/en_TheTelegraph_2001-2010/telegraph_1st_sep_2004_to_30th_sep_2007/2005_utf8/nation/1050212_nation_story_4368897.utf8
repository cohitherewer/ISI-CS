 PM on airport 

 Bangalore, Feb. 11: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is confident that the first flight would take off from the Rs 1,350-crore Greenfield International Airport near here ahead of schedule ? January 2008, reports our special correspondent. 

 Singh described Bangalore as the ?pride of India? at a meeting to review the progress of the project and other infrastructure schemes here.

 The Prime Minister, however, agreed with the CEOs of several infotech companies that the city needs more efficient infrastructure. ?I will work with the state government to realise the legitimate ambition of the people. Entrepreneurs of Bangalore are largely responsible for India becoming such a hot destination for investors,? he said.

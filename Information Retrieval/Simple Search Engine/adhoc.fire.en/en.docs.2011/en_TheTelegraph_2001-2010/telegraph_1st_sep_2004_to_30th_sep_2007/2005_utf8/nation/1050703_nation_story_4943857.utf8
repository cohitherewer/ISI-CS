 Fatwa firefight begins

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 July 2: Widespread criticism of the so-called fatwa on Imrana and rumblings within the community have woken up Muslim leaders to the need to quieten the controversy.

 A fact-finding team of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has been sent to Muzaffarnagar by board secretary Maulana Nizamuddin. The board plans to hold a meeting of its working committee in Lucknow but has yet to fix a date.

 Some board officials questioned the status of the Deoband seminarys opinion that rape by her father-in-law had automatically annulled Imranas marriage. They blamed the media for terming it a fatwa. Board chief Maulana Rabey Nadvi said a fatwa is an opinion, not a judicial verdict.

 The Darul Uloom (seminary) has gone on the defensive. Mufti Habib-ur Rahman of the seminary, who announced the opinion on Imrana, today said the schools theologians had been rushed into giving a decision after some people kept asking them about Imranas marital status. 

 He said he had told these people to raise the queries before a Shariat court.

 A board member has questioned the seminarys right to adjudicate on a purely criminal offence.

 The Darul Uloom should have kept quiet as India is not an Islamic country, Naeem Hamid said. What is the logic behind giving a decision that penalises one party when it has no power to punish the culprit? 

 The personal law boards response, sources said, would take into account the criminal aspect of the case as well as its personal law aspect. It wants the nations criminal law to take its course and punish the culprit, if found guilty, with the maximum sentence.

 On the personal law aspect ? whether a Muslim womans marriage stands dissolved if she is raped by her father-in-law ? the schools of Islamic jurisprudence, such as the Hanafi and Shafai schools, differ among themselves.

 Other Muslim scholars, such as former Chief Justice of India A.M. Ahmadi and Shariat expert Tahir Mahmood, said the so-called fatwa betrayed ignorance.

 Marriage is not invalidated by rape, adultery or incest, Mahmood said. There are only two ways to end a marriage: divorce ? including khula (where the woman seeks separation) ? and death.

 Syed Shahabuddin, who had led the campaign for treating the Shah Bano alimony case under Shariat law, has appealed to the clergy not to issue fatwas on sensitive matters unless approached by the parties concerned or without probing the circumstances.

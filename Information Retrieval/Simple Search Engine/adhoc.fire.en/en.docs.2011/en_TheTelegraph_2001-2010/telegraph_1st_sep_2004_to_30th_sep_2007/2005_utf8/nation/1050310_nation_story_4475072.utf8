 BJP eyes trap for Paswan

 New Delhi, March 9: The BJP is thinking up a new strategy to get the numbers in Bihar and break the political deadlock: isolate Ram Vilas Paswan from his own MLAs.

 The amended anti-defection law may have nullified a one-third split but the BJP, a senior leader said, is examining it to get around this clause. 

 The law is clear that the legislature party leader, and not his party chief, offers letters of support for a coalition and issues whips. The House?s presiding officer would heed only his moves and not those of his party chief.

 Paswan is not an MLA and the leader of his legislature party is Ramashray Prasad Singh, who may not necessarily have a problem in engaging with the NDA like the Lok Janshakti Party chief has, BJP sources said.

 The sources said the party is relying on Paswan?s upper-caste legislators to press him to go with the NDA and probably chart an ?independent? course if he stuck to his stand.

 The BJP cited the same legal provision to bolster its case in Jharkhand, too, where the lone Jharkhand Party MLA, Enos Ekka, was part of the NDA?s flock though his party chief N.E. Horo had given a letter of support to Shibu Soren.

 The UPA hopes to use this ?violation? of the party whip to seek Ekka?s disqualification before the confidence vote. But NDA strategists claim Horo?s ?whip? is legally invalid.

 Sonia meeting

 Ram Vilas Paswan met the Congress chief tonight and appealed for Bihar?s economic development and improved law and order, reports our special correspondent. 

 ?Sonia Gandhi gave the assurance that the Centre would try to extend maximum help to ensure all-round development and tone up the law and order machinery,? Paswan later said.

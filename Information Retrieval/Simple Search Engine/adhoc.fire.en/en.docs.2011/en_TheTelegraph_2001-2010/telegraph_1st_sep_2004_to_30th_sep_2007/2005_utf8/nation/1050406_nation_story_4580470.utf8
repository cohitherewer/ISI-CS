 Mhatre suit

 Mumbai, April 5: A relative of a woman run over by Ravindra Mhatre, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray?s personal assistant, today filed a writ petition seeking cancellation of bail and his re-arrest under the non-bailable offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, reports our special correspondent.

 The petition in Bombay High Court was filed by Manish Mashelkar, the grandson of 75-year-old Leela Mashelkar, one of the two women run over by Mhatre on March 26. 

 Mashelkar also sought a compensation of Rs 20 lakh from the state. 

 The petition is likely to come up for hearing tomorrow.

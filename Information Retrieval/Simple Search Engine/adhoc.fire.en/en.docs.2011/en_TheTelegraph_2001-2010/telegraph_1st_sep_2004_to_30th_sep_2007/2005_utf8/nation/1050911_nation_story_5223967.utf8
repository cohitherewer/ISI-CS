 Crude bomb injures duo

 New Delhi (PTI): A crude explosive device blew up in northwest Delhi on Saturday injuring a man and his grandson, but police ruled out a terrorist angle to the blast.

 The explosive, lying in a garbage heap in an isolated area in Model Town, went off when Ram Murti (50) and his two-year-old grandson picked it up. Murtis right thumb was severed as a result of the blast and his grandson was also injured. Both have been hospitalised.

 A senior police official said the explosive was probably abandoned by people who used such crude bombs to kill fish in a stream nearby. It is unlikely that terrorists were involved but investigations were on, the official said. 

 Forensic experts were investigating the scene of the blast.

 Fire in Connaught Place 

 New Delhi (PTI): A major fire on Saturday 

 caused heavy damage to offices on the ninth and tenth floors 

 of a multi-storeyed building in the Connaught Place area 

 in the heart of the city.

 The fire broke out on the ninth floor of Himalaya 

 House on Kasturba Gandhi Marg around 10:45 am, fire department 

 officials said. Around 25 fire-tenders were rushed to douse 

 the fire, which later also spread to the tenth floor of 

 the building that houses offices of banks and scores of 

 private companies.

 It took the fire-fighters around one hour to extinguish the blaze, the officials said.

 The building was evacuated, they said, adding that an elderly man fell unconscious as a result of smoke inhalation and had to be taken to hospital.

 The cause of the fire is not yet known.

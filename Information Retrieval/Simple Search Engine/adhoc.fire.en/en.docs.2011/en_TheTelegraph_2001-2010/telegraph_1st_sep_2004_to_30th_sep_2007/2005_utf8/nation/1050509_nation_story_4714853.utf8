 Dawood on UN wanted list

 Dawood: Under glare

 New Delhi, May 8 (PTI): The United Nations has named don Dawood Ibrahim, the alleged mastermind behind the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, in the wanted list of individuals having links with al Qaida.

 According to the fresh list released by the world body, Dawoods name figured under UN resolution 1267, which mandates all countries to freeze the assets of those named and prevent their entry into or transit through their territories.

 The resolution also asks the member countries to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale and transfer of arms and military equipment to the entities belonging to the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and al Qaida.

 The UN list has named Dawood as an Indian citizen with his place of birth being Ratnagiri in Maharashtra and having an Indian passport A-333602. However, the world body has failed to find his present location.

 Dawood, who is believed to be shuttling between the Pakistan port-city of Karachi and a Gulf country, was named a specially designated global terrorist by the US, after which it decided to move the UN for freezing all his assets.

 The move by the UN could cause problems for Pakistan whom India has been accusing of supporting and providing shelter to the don.

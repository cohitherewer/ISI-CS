 Rodent fossil found in Thar

 Jaipur, Nov. 24 (PTI): The Geological Survey of India (GSI) today claimed to have found the worlds oldest rodent fossil from the Thar desert in Rajasthan recently.

 It is a discovery of a significant micro-vertebrate fossil assemblage of the cretaceous age about 142 to 93.2 million years old, GSIs head of the palaeontology department P.M. Dutta said.

 After digging millions of tonnes of sand in the Jaisalmer region early this year, Duttas team found an upper molariform tooth (1.05 mm long and 0.75 mm wide) supported by five roots. This, he said, was the oldest rodent (rat family) fossil found in the world so far.

 The GSI team also found remains of an ancient fish and reptile belonging to the Mesozoic era.

 Kerala bait of submarine sights 

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 30: Jules Verne fans and those with a taste for adventure could be making a beeline for Kerala sometime soon. On offer will be a beauty deeper than the skin of landscape and beach.

 Gods own country is set to enter a different league: that of submarine tourism. A three-hour ride, 300 feet below water, may not quite match up to a 20,000-league odyssey, but still promises unforgettable sights and out-of-the-world silences at Rs 1,500-2,000.

 Octopuses? Seahorses? The promoters arent telling what you might be able to see but assure you theres little danger of being trapped in a giant squids tentacles. The submarines obstacle avoidance sonar system is insurance enough against too-close encounters with coral reefs or marine life.

 The promoter, Pioneer Underwater Tours, has signed up with a Finnish firm for the craft, which is likely to cost about Rs 10 crore. The Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation will provide the boats to ferry the tourists between the jetty and the sub and look after maintenance and marketing.

 On each trip, the submarine will carry 24 passengers and a crew of two. It will have external lighting, VHF and through-water communications, and underwater video.

 The promoter has already got the green light from the navy and the coastguard and is waiting for clearance from the director-general of shipping. 

 The company has paid about a fifth of the vessels cost and is planning to raise the rest of the money from overseas as Indian banks have backed out, said its CEO, K. Bhaskaran.

 The state corporations managing director, K.N. Sateesh, said tourist submarines are non-polluting, fitted with battery-powered electric thrusters that emit no hydrocarbons or other effluents. They move at low speeds and are extraordinarily manoeuvrable. One such craft is operating in the Maldives.

 The announcement created a buzz at the three-day India International Boat Show, which opened at Kochi today amid a spurt in the number of buyers. There were 500-odd pre-registered buyers and trade visitors, as well as 22 international exhibitors, notably the British Marine Federation, the apex trade association for Britains leisure boats and super yachts industry.

 Leading international boating and maritime equipment brands like Ferretti, Sunseeker, Princess, Azimut, Benetti, Volvo, Bayliner and Gulf Craft have set up stalls.

 Kochi is going to be another hub in the region after Dubai and Singapore for leisure boating and marine tourism, state tourism minister K.C. Venugopal said.

 Last year, Kerala earned Rs 6,000 crore from tourism. This year, it has added health tourism to the menu to woo West Asian tourists.

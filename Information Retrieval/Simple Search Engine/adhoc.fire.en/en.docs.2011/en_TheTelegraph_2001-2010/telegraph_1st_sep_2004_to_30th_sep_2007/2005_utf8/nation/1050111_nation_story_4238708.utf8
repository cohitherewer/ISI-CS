 Cong bullies Laloo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The Congress has confronted Laloo Prasad Yadav with a long wish list of constituencies in Bihar, shortly after ignoring his protests over seat sharing in Jharkhand.

 Human resource development minister Arjun Singh is understood to have handed over to the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief a list of 75 seats it wishes to contest as part of an RJD-led alliance as Laloo Prasad returned to the seat-sharing table after Congress chief Sonia Gandhi refused him an audience.

 Singh did not just stun Laloo Prasad with the Bihar list. The Congress leader is understood to have simply ignored the RJD chief?s demand for renegotiating Friday?s Jharkhand seat-sharing formula, according to which the RJD will contest just nine of the 81 Assembly seats as part of an alliance that includes the Congress, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the CPI.

 The Congress list for Bihar has put Laloo Prasad, already softened over Jharkhand, on the backfoot. With Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan ready with liberal offers to the Congress for forging an alternative secular alliance in Bihar, Congress negotiators believe that the RJD leader is not in a position to dismiss the party with just a few seats as he had done during the Lok Sabha polls in 2004.

 Congress negotiators reckon that Laloo Prasad would have liked to give the party not more than 25-30 seats in Bihar though the state Congress under Ram Jatan Sinha has staked claim for 106 of the 243 seats.

 At yesterday?s talks, Laloo Prasad is learnt to have not made any comment on the Congress demand. Instead, he agreed to entrust party colleague and union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh to hold follow-up talks with Congress leaders M.L. Fotedar and Harikesh Bahadur and prepare the ground for Singh-Laloo Prasad talks slated for tomorrow.

 Much as the RJD leader would expect the CPI and the CPM to help him arrive at a reasonable seat-sharing deal with the Congress, the two communist parties are learnt to have asked for 20 and 10 seats, respectively. 

 If Laloo Prasad agrees to all the demands, the RJD would be left with 138 seats ? the same number the Janata Dal (United) will be contesting in alliance with the BJP.

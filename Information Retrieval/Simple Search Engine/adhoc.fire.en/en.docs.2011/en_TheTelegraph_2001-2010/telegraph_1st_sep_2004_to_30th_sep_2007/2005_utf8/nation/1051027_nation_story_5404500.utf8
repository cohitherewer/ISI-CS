 Kashmir trial for Cong chief

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Sonia

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Jammu and Kashmir Congress MLAs are understood to have threatened to quit the Assembly if Sonia Gandhi allows Mufti Mohammad Sayeed an extended run as chief minister.

 State Congress leaders want the party to hold its coalition partner, Sayeeds Peoples Democratic Party, to its promise of handing over the reins three years after being in power. Following the election victory of 2002, the Congress and PDP had agreed to split the six-year term between themselves, with Sayeeds party getting first shot at the chief ministers post.

 Sayeeds three-year tenure ends on November 2, but Sonia apparently wants him to continue ? probably for at least a year ? and the MLAs reported threat seems a last-ditch move to try and get her to change her mind. 

 The legislators, most of them from Jammu, have been camping in Delhi for the past three days to step up pressure on Sonia. Sources said they had met state Speaker Tara Chand ? who, too, was in the capital ? and issued their threat to resign.

 Party general secretary Ambika Soni, however, dismissed reports of the threat, saying: The question does not arise. Our MLAs may be having very strong views, but they will not do any such thing.

 State Congress chief Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed, who met Sonia yesterday, said he didnt know about any such development. Congress leader and deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma said: Its a joke. Who wants to quit Assembly membership?

 Soni and Sharma were certain that all party leaders in the state would accept Sonias verdict whatever their own views were.

 Sources said the Congress president has asked all party MLAs and ministers to return to the state, resume the tasks they have been assigned in the relief operations and wait for her decision on the subject of power transfer.

 Sonia may, however, put off a planned visit to the state on Friday, during which she was expected to announce her decision on Sayeed. Sharma had this evening confirmed Sonias visit to Srinagar and some of the quake-hit areas along the Line of Control.

 But late at night, sources said she may not go. They cited security and logistical reasons relating to Ramazan and the shift of government headquarters from Srinagar to winter capital Jammu.

 Speaker for recall right 

 New Delhi, April 28: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today proposed a law to recall legislators who fail to live up to the expectations of the people and indulge in demeaning behaviour, reports our special correspondent.

 The law would give the electorate the right to seek a referendum on withdrawing support to the legislator they are dissatisfied with. 

 ?I urge all to consider whether we should give our people the right to recall their elected representatives, if the situation so demands,? said Chatterjee. 

 He asked ?all concerned? to ensure that the democratic institutions, particularly, the Parliament and the Assemblies, ?collectively function as the most important bodies representing the people?.

 However, it is not clear if his cries have reached the right quarters, as Chatterjee?s audience comprised CBI personnel and not parliamentarians.

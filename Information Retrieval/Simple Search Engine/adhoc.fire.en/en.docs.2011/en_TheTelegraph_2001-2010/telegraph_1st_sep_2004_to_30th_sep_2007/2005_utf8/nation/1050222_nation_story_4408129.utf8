 :-0? fyi, it?s English

 No gibberish, this

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: ?atb, kit, cul8r, b4n!

 Think it?s gibberish? Come on. It?s the new language of communication in this age of mobile phones and email.

 What it simply means is all the best, keep in touch, see you later and bye for now. And it?s got the sanction of the custodians of the language.

 All this and much more in electronic messaging and telephoning have been included in the Oxford Advanced Learner?s Dictionary. ?People like to know how to send out an email, whether it is okay to use informal language, whether it is acceptable to start with hello,? says editor Sally Wehmeier.

 ?While I must admit that the only ones I personally use regularly are btw (by the way) and fyi (for your information), but I often see others used, also emoticons. These words and abbreviations have been included in other dictionaries.? 

 Some of the popular emoticons, or symbols used to express feelings, listed in the dictionary include :-0 (surprised), :-q (I don?t understand), :-( (crying), :-1 (bored) and :-) (laughing).

 The dictionary explains that text messages, chat room messages and sometimes emails can be written using abbreviations and the smallest number of letters possible. It gives examples of how words might be shown in a message ? 2day (today), bbl (bye back later), wknd (weekend), myob (mind your own business) and imho (in my humble opinion).

 ?Oxford University Press has a team of people who monitor the language?? says Wehmeier. ?What they record will serve when we are updating the dictionary.?

 Wehmeier says emoticons and electronic messaging have been included in the dictionary because the ?need? to explain them arises, ?particularly? in the case of the advanced learner?s dictionary. ?Our readers are not native speakers of English,? the editor explains, ?and they could easily get confused by something like ?2nite?.?

 ?Within a chat group whose members are familiar with each other, people develop their own abbreviations. However, we want to point out the most common ones. They are part of the language and so deserve a place in the dictionary?s description of the language,? Wehmeier says.

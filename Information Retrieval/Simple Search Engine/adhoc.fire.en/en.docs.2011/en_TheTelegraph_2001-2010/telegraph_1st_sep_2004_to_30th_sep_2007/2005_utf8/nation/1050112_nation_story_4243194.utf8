 Rally rage for Rabri regime

 Patna, Jan. 11: Non-gazetted state employees put up an impressive show of strength here today as thousands of them marched from Gandhi Maidan to Hartali Chowk, a day before the Election Commission?s deadline expires.

 The rally ended in a public meeting addressed by leaders of the three striking associations ? Bihar Rajya Sarkari-Ardh Sarkari Sevakarmi Samyukth Morcha, Bihar Sachivalaya Seva Sangh and Bihar Rajya Arajpatrit Karamchari Mahasangh ? who vowed to continue the strike till the government gave in to all their demands.

 While the rally supporters came down heavily on the Rashtriya Janata Dal government ? which they called the ?mia biwi sarkar? ? for its failure to meet their demands, chief minister Rabri Devi and railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav were at the receiving end of hostile slogans. 

 Angry over the delay in ?justice? and alleged pressure tactics adopted by the government, the employees vowed to teach the ?corrupt? RJD regime a lesson. ?We will ensure that the husband-wife rule in Bihar comes to an end. We don?t think this regime can provide justice,? a speaker said.

 More than 3 lakh employees are on an indefinite strike to press their demands, which includes raising the retirement age to 60 and the merger of 50 per cent dearness allowance with basic pay. The poll panel had given the employees time till today to take a decision on the strike. But a resolution seems unlikely as several rounds of talks with the government have failed to break the deadlock. 

 While the government has stuck to its stand that it will consider the demands only after the elections, the employees argue that what they have asked for is ?nothing new?. 

 The employees? organisations leading the agitation have accused the government of backtracking from what had been agreed upon earlier. They have also demanded a reduction in the number of working days from six to five. 

 Concerned over the dearth of personnel for the elections, the commission is understood to have prepared a list of about 51,000 bank and school employees as well as retired government workers to conduct the first phase of the polls on February 3.

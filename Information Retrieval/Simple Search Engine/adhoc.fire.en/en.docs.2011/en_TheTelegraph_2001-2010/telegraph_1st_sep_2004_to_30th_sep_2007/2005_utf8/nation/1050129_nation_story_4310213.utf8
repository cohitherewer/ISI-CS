 Monday court date for Black Friday

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 28: The makers of Black Friday, a film on the Mumbai blasts of 1993, petitioned the Supreme Court today to vacate the stay order on the release of the movie.

 The apex court will hear the case on January 31, said Arindam Mitra, who is representing the film?s producer.

 Black Friday, directed by Anurag Kashyap, one of the writers of Satya, and based on a book written by journalist S. Hussain Zaidi, was due to hit theatres today. But yesterday, Bombay High Court stayed the release till February 3, after an accused in the blasts case argued that the film might prejudice the outcome of the case.

 The film takes off from March 9, 1993, when Gul Mohammad, a Mumbai resident, surrenders himself before police, saying there is a huge conspiracy to bomb major locations in the city. The police dismiss him, but three days later, the city is devastated by the blasts, killing 257 people.

 The film stars Kay Kay Menon, Aditya Srivastava and Pawan Malhotra. 

 Director Kashyap was not available for comment, but Farhana Shah, who is defending the accused, said her clients were apprehensive of the impact of the film on the verdict. 

 The verdict is expected soon, within two to three months, said Shah.

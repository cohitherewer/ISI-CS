 PM rings monsoon alert 

 - States asked to gear up for flood or drought

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today wrote a letter to all chief ministers asking them to be prepared for drought or flood even as monsoon clouds gathered over the Andamans.

 The letter said though the Met department has predicted a normal monsoon, it is possible that there may be variations at regional and local levels. I would, therefore, like to draw your special attention to the possibilities of drought or floods in the coming months and the need to take adequate precautionary measures in advance so that we are not found wanting.

 A senior weather scientist pointed out that even when the monsoon is above normal for the country as a whole, small pockets may suffer drought or floods. Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, director of long-range forecast research at the Indian Meteorological Department in Pune, said the letter may have been intended to caution states about these variations that occur every year.

 A late and uneven monsoon was the first crisis the Singh government faced after taking over in May last year. While Andhra Pradesh struggled with drought, Bihar and the Northeast were hit by floods.

 The Prime Minister has suggested that in chronically rain-deficient areas, arrangements should be made to provide wage employment, drinking water, foodgrain and fodder. In flood-prone areas, Singh has asked state governments to be ready to evacuate people and to keep adequate stocks of grain and other essentials for relief. 

 Last year, administration lapses had worsened the problem, sources said, prompting todays alert.

 The June-September monsoon, closely watched in India because two-thirds of the population earns a living from agriculture, is due to hit the Andamans within the next 48 hours and reach Kerala around June 7, a week late.

 The weather office has said monsoon rainfall for all of India is likely to be 98 per cent of the long-period average, with a margin of error of 5 per cent. However, meteorologists admit a delay of more than 10 days could hit the winter crops, sown in June and July and harvested in October and November.

 Although India has adequate financial muscle to withstand a bad monsoon, the rains still play a pivotal role in deciding economic growth rates and consumption patterns. A bad monsoon also has a political impact, with the government at the Centre usually bearing the brunt.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram has forecast that farm growth is likely to be around 3 per cent this year, the GDP growth rate 7 per cent and inflation contained at 5 per cent. But a round of droughts and floods in various states could upset all his plans. 

 The other big worry for the economy is the rising world crude prices. Domestic retail prices of petrol and diesel have not been raised since November 2004, but it does not appear the government will be able to hold off a hike much longer.

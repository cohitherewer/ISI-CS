 Autocrat for some, Vishnu for others

 Kathmandu, Feb. 1 (Reuters): His supporters say Nepal?s King Gyanendra is a no-nonsense man who never shies away from taking tough decisions.

 Critics say the poetry-loving monarch, who sacked his Prime Minister and government today, is nothing but an autocrat who often oversteps his powers.

 Either way, nobody can ignore the 58-year-old who was first named king when he was just a toddler and then returned to the throne in 2001 after a bizarre palace shootout that killed his brother and several members of the royal family.

 Today, King Gyanendra sacked the government and assumed power for the next three years.

 It is the second time a king has taken power since Nepal abandoned its absolute monarchy and elected its first Prime Minister in 1991.

 Many Nepalis say the portly, severe man, usually dressed in narrow daura-suruwal trousers and a knee-length shirt, is the reason their country is in crisis.

 Since he took over, democracy has been frozen and a brutal Maoist campaign to replace the constitutional monarchy with a communist republic has become steadily more bloody. The war has scared off tourists and the economy of one of the world?s poorest countries is faltering.

 Many Nepalis still consider the king the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the god of protection. But Gyanendra?s popularity has steadily fallen in the last three years and his performance had some Nepalis talking about what would once have been blasphemy: turning the world?s only Hindu kingdom into a republic.

 He is said to be scornful of most politicians, who have been locked in interminable squabbles since democracy was introduced in 1991. ?Gyanendra is not very enthusiastic about democracy. His brother, the former king, promoted democracy,? said Kalim Bahadur, a South Asian political analyst in Delhi.

 The king went to a school in Darjeeling and graduated from Kathmandu?s Tribhuvan University. 

 Deeply involved in environment conservation, he was the chairman of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation until he ascended the throne. 

 Gyanendra is married to Queen Komal and has a son, Paras, heir to the throne.

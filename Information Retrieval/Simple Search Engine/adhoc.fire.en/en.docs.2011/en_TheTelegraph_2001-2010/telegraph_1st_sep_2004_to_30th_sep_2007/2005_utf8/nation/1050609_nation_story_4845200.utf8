 DTH warriors load guns

 - Space TV and Sun in race with Doordarshan amp; Zee

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcutta, June 8: The war of the wireless is hotting up. 

 With the Centre providing the go-ahead, the Tata-STAR joint venture Space TV and southern giant Sun Network are set to join existing players ? the Zee-backed Dish TV and Doordarshan ? on the direct-to-home battlefield.

 Direct-to-home (DTH) promises television viewers freedom from cable operators control and allows access to channels by installing a mini-dish and a set-top box. Broadcasters are set to gain as well by forming a direct relationship with their consumers and earning revenues from every customer, unlike on the cable model.

 With the conditional access system failing to take off and cable switch-offs continuing to hold consumers to ransom across the country, DTH could be the way ahead, feel analysts and players.

 Of the nine crore households with TV sets in India, 4.5 crore do not have access to cable, says Doordarshan CEO K.S. Sarma. Our target is to capture at least two crore of that segment with DTH.

 Doordarshans Direct+ offers 30 free-to-air channels and 13 FM stations, for a hardware priced around Rs 3,000 and no subscription cost.

 Dish TV and Doordarshan claim to have covered around 32.5 lakh homes between them and plan to add another 27.5 lakh by March 2006. By then, two new players would also have arrived.

 After remaining stuck for a considerable time, Space TVs DTH application received the letter of intent from the government last month and Sun is set to receive it soon, paving the way for a service licence.

 Zees Dish TV reacted to the news by slashing prices. Its welcome package now offers 70 channels free for a year with installation charges of Rs 3,990. We are selling 2,000 sets daily since we dropped the price, claims Sunil Khanna, CEO of New Era Entertainment, which markets Dish TV.

 The prices are sure to plummet further with the entry of new players, declares Vivek Couto, analyst with Hong Kong-based research firm Media Partners Asia. But customer service will also be a key area.

 With cut-throat competition on the cards, the newcomers are willing to reveal little. Since this is an evolving industry, our final pricing will be decided and announced closer to the launch, around end-2005, says Space TV CEO Vikram Kaushik.

 The characteristically quiet Sun has continued to launch new regional channels. According to analysts, Suns offering will focus on the south Indian market with a strong regional content.

 Beam-sharing could be a major issue. Despite a must-provide order from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the STAR and Sony channels continue to remain unavailable on Dish TV. 

 Its a challenge for Trai to enforce the regulation, complains Khanna, admitting that non-availability of the two have hampered the growth of Dish TV. 

 But is the market big enough for four DTH players when the US and the UK have only one or two? Its big enough for two competing platforms (cable and DTH) to co-exist, but whether for four DTH players ? its too early to say, feels Couto.

 Media Partners projects the number of DTH subscribers at 72 lakh in 2010 (6 per cent of TV households and 10 per cent of cable homes) and a revenue of Rs 1,740 crore.

 Doordarshan is considering carriage fee (amount charged from free-to-air channels for broadcasting them) revenues and penetration in rural areas as its next steps. Around 48 channels are waiting to come on board and we should be able to take in 17 of them, says Sarma.

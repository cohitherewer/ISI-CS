Calcutta, Sept. 3: Eight months after the tsunami devastated the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India and Indonesia, the two countries have begun the first-ever joint patrolling on the high seas.

 This will be followed by a similar exercise with Thailand in mid-September, ahead of a massive war game involving all naval powers of the region in January, where the Indian fleet is set to display its might.

 With gunrunners and pirates becoming a big threat for all the countries in this region, the India-Indonesia joint patrol assumes great significance. This is a clear signal to the world that we have overcome the devastation caused by tsunami and are ready to tackle other pressing problems, Commodore A.K. Julka, the commander of the naval component of the Andaman and Nicobar Integrated Command, said from Port Blair.

 The area of concern for all of us is the Malacca Strait, where the number of piracy cases is quiet high. For the Indonesians, the Aceh rebels have always been a thorn in their attempts to restore peace, despite favourable talks in Helsinki last month, Julka said.

 Both the governments decided to start a joint exercise, following information of gunrunning vessels heading towards Indian territory.

 For nearly a month, four naval ships from India and a similar number from Indonesia will carry out joint patrolling of a 90-mile stretch between Great Nicobar and Sabang in Indonesia. 

 Our ships will monitor till the halfway mark of the International Boundary Line. The rest of the region will be manned by their (Indonesia) ships, said Julka.

 The Indonesian naval ship KRI Teuku Umar, commanded by Major Irvansyah, arrived in Port Blair on Wednesday to mark the beginning of the joint exercise. 

 Aswoto Saranang, the commanding officer, naval base Sabang, arrived on board the Indonesian ship, which is an advanced patrol ship with anti-submarine warfare capabilities. 

 The ship ? of German make ? joined the Indonesian fleet in 1997 and is based in Jakarta.

 Saranang and Irvansyah held discussions with Julka and Lt General Aditya Singh, the commander-in-chief, Andaman and Nicobar Command, on bilateral issues.

 We will have more such exercises. We should have done this exercise a long time ago, but it is good that we are finally having some joint patrolling, Julka said.

 Kashmir tax centre raiders gunned down

 MUKHTAR AHMAD 

 Srinagar, Jan. 8: Security forces today gunned down the two fidayeen holed up inside the income-tax headquarters since yesterday, ending a 24-hour gunbattle.

 Five others have been killed in the encounter, including BSF deputy commandant S.S. Rawat.

 The income-tax building at Barbarshah in the heart of the city was destroyed in the initial blaze, which erupted after the militants hurled hand grenades, and the subsequent exchange of fire, police said. Important tax records are also feared to have been burnt, they added.

 An employee of the income-tax department, identified as Abdul Waheed Sheikh, succumbed to injuries suffered while he was trapped in the building. The police recovered his body this evening.

 A team of the special operations group came under heavy fire when it tried to storm the income-tax complex. One member of the team, Mohammad Ashraf, was killed on the spot while three were injured.

 The troops, who had surrounded the complex, had earlier assumed that the fidayeen were dead. When they were proved wrong this morning, they used mortar rounds and powerful grenades.

 The security forces had to suspend the operation last evening as it became dark. Floodlights were set up in the entire area to ensure that the militants did not escape. 

 More than 70 employees of the department and visitors were rescued by the police and the security forces, who were assisted by the state fire service department.

 The attack comes less than three weeks ahead of the Republic Day celebrations and civic polls scheduled in the state later this month. The security around all government, semi-government and sensitive installations across the city has been beefed up.

 Blood, however, continued to spill in another part of the Valley. Two armymen were killed and one wounded in an encounter during a search operation at Imam Sahib village near Shopian in south Kashmir this afternoon.

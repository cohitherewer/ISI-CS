The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Telecast row

 Calcutta, April 5: ESPN-STAR Sports today told Delhi High Court that it would not use Doordarshan footage of the India-Pakistan cricket series for its highlights package, says a staff reporter.

 Prasar Bharati, Doordarshan?s governing body and the owner of the India-Pakistan series telecast rights, recently moved court accusing ESPN-STAR Sports of illegally using the footage. The national broadcaster claimed that the sports major was raking in huge money through unauthorised booking of advertisements on programmes based on exclusive Doordarshan content.

 Prasar Bharati had sent legal notices to various channels pointing out that they could only use the footage in news bulletins with usage not exceeding 30 seconds per bulletin.

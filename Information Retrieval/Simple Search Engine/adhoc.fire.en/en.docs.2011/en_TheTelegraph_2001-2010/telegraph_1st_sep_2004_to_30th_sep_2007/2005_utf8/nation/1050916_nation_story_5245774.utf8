 Life term for killer doctor

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: A doctor who poisoned his wifes father, mother and three minor siblings to grab their property has been jailed for life with the Centre asked not to reduce his term for good conduct in jail.

 The direction by a two-judge Supreme Court bench comes at a time when a debate is raging on whether a life term means jail for life or just 14 years. The usual practice has been to reduce life convicts stay in prison for good conduct. They become eligible for this after 14 years; most are freed within 18 years.

 This apart, lifers are sometimes released on auspicious occasions such as Independence Day, Republic Day and Universal Human Rights Day.

 Dr Sampath Kumar Reddy ? who injected his in-laws with poison on the pretext of treating them for AIDS ? must not get this benefit either, the apex court said.

 The division bench of Justices H.K. Sema and Tarun Chatterjee said the man who committed such a gruesome murder shall not get the benefit of any remission either granted by the state or by the Government of India on any auspicious occasion.

 Reddy had convinced his in-laws that they were all HIV-positive and needed treatment. He then poisoned them with pan curonium bromide, the trade name of which is pavulon, administered through injection, the court said.

 Reddy, a greedy son-in-law with the intention of grabbing the property of his father-in-law, wiped out the entire family; even three minor, innocent children were not spared, the judges observed.

 Justice Sema, writing the judgment, said the facts of the case shocked the judicial conscience of the court.

 Considering the nature of the crime and the manner in which it has been perpetrated, the ends of justice would warrant that the appellant (Reddy) should be in jail for life, the bench said.

 The conflict over what a life term means has arisen because many life convicts are released after 14 years while some languish in jail longer. 

 Different benches of the apex court have given different verdicts in the matter, with one saying life term means full life term spent in prison but others ordering release of convicts after 14 years.

 The jail manuals of different states confound the issue, allowing life convicts to be released variously after 14, 18 or 20 years.

 Life sentence for life: SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The Supreme Court today upheld the decision of a 1981 constitution bench that life sentence means imprisonment for life, not 14 or 18 or 20 years as various parties have been claiming.

 The court, however, gave state governments the right to decide if they wished to pare the sentences of life convicts on grounds of good conduct or any other reason in keeping with law.

 The appropriate government would be at liberty to pass any appropriate order of remission in accordance with law, the order said, again upholding a provision in the 1981 verdict.

 This is, however, only the first of a series of judgments expected in the life term cases as there are several batches of petitions from life convicts pending before four different benches.

 A division bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and B.N. Srikrishna dismissed the appeals of life convicts Md Munna and Kartick Biswas, jailed in Calcutta, from among a total of over 70, including 48 from Bengal.

 But it pointed out that the Bengal government had the liberty to free the prisoners when they complete 20 years in jail if it were to go by Rule 751 of the West Bengal Jail Code.

 The confusion over what the length of a life sentence is stems from this remission clause. 

 Each state has its own jail manual by which individual governments can free life convicts at any time between 14 and 20 years.

 Such remissions can either be on grounds of good conduct or on auspicious days like Independence Day, Republic Day or Human Rights Day.

 The court clarified that provisions in states jail manuals would not infringe on the Indian Penal Code or the Criminal Procedure Code as there is no provision in either whereby life imprisonment could be treated as 14 or 20 years.

 The same bench dismissed another petition by Bhola Malik, a life convict in Alipore Jail, in view of the earlier judgment.

 Another bench ? of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal, C.K. Thakker and Raja Varadarajulu Raveendran ? heard another set of petitions by life convicts Samir Ojha and Adhir Mandal from Calcutta. 

 It gave the petitioners a week to first read the judgment and fixed hearings after that.

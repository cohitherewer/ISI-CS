 Kings army grapples with desertion

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, May 23: Indias resumption of military aid to Nepal at the insistence of defence headquarters last week has been made despite suspicions that the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) is manned by straw soldiers.

 The kings army is grappling with desertions forced by threats from Maoist rebels. For any army in the middle of a war, desertions are a corrosive danger.

 Although army headquarters in New Delhi, which closely monitors the military situation in the kingdom through its multiple channels in the RNA, does not publicly give vent to its assessment, it is concerned over the reports. The Indian Army is closely involved with training and equipping the RNA and has been advising it on its expansion.

 Among the latest reports of desertions is an encounter that a retired Indian diplomat had with a former soldier of the RNA in Kathmandu earlier this week. Deb Mukarji, who has served as Indian ambassador in Kathmandu, recounted at a meeting here on Wednesday his conversation with an RNA deserter. Mukarji was reluctant to give details so as not to put the deserter at risk.

 He told me that he had quit the RNA because it did not pay him enough to meet the extortionate demands of the Maobadi, Mukarji said. The former diplomat was chairing a session at the United Services Institution (USI).

 Mukarji was in Kathmandu in connection with the release of a book and not on any official mission. As such, it was a chance encounter with the deserter.

 But evidence from Nepal on the weakness of the RNA has been mounting. At the same session, Major General Ashok Mehta, a retired Gorkha Regiment officer and military analyst, gave a presentation on Existing and emerging challenges of the RNA to meet the Maoist threat.

 Mehta said he estimated the total number of desertions by RNA soldiers at between 200 and 300 a month. Mehta, a frequent visitor to Nepal, said he was not surprised by the figures that he had culled from his sources in Kathmandu on his last visit because the insurgency has riven families.

 The session was attended, among others, by representatives of diplomatic missions in New Delhi and from army headquarters.

 Mehta estimated that the Maoists army had a strength of 8,000 to 12,000 fighters but only 4,000 weapons. They have the power of intimidation, the power to strike fear but very little fire-power. The RNA, he said, has 83,000 troops and is projected to increase its strength to 1 lakh by 2010. But some of its best and most important fighting units are stationed inside the Narayanhiti compound in Kathmandu and are effectively a palace guard.

 Since the February coup, violence in Nepal has escalated and the RNA has improved its defensive tactics but it is not taking the battle to the Maoists. The rebels have interpreted the current phase of their peoples war as the period of strategic offensive. Mehta said this is the context in which hundreds of thousands of families in Nepal are trapped.

 The threat from the Maoists to the RNA was also being highlighted by the press despite the media censorship. 

 In an editorial last week, the mainstream daily Kathmandu Post said: Of late, the Maoists have targeted the families of Royal Nepal Army personnel. They have extorted money, locked up the houses and seized the property of RNA personnel. As a result, the families of RNA personnel have been impelled to flee their villages overnight to safer places. Thousands of people have been displaced following the Maoist atrocities since the February 1 royal move. 

 The violence against the families of RNA personnel has increased especially in the insurgency-hit districts, though a large number of displaced families are yet to report to the RNA human rights cell. The RNA says altogether 292 families of RNA personnel have fled their villages since February 1 this year.

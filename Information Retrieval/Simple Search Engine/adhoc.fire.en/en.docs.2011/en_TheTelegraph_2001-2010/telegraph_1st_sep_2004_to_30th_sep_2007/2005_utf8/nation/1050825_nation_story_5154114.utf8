 Morph sleaze stalks girls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 24: When the first call came, Suresh Nagnath exploded.

 How dare someone call up his daughter asking for sex?

 Then the other calls started coming in. They were complete strangers and all said the same thing: they had got the telephone number and address through an Internet news group on yahoo.com.

 It was December 2004 and the morph merchants were at it.

 Unknown to the BSNL employee and his 20-year-old daughter, the girls photograph had been morphed with bodies of porn stars and circulated on the Net.

 Our investigations showed that photographs of this girl were morphed on to the bodies of porn stars and circulated on the Internet. The girls telephone number and address were also circulated. As a result, she was inundated with calls, Sudhir Dabhade, assistant commissioner, city division of Aurangabad police, said today.

 She is not the only victim of such sleaze.

 Nine months after Nagnaths December 14 complaint to the police, investigators are questioning two top officials and several MTech students of an institute affiliated to the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar University in Aurangabad in a case where faces of over 250 girls were morphed and circulated as call girls.

 Photographs of at least 256 girls were morphed and used for pornography, Dabhade said.

 The case, which has come to light at a time Mumbai police are investigating a racket involving morphed images of Bollywood actors with pornographic films for circulation as mobile phone clips, has shocked Maharashtras conservative Marathwada region.

 Aurangabad police traced the Internet Protocol address that uploaded the photographs of Nagnaths daughter to the Centre for Electronic Design and Technology of India. The IP address was traced to the computer lab in the institute which is used by 50-odd MTech and diploma students, Dabhade said.

 Aurangabad police formally lodged a criminal complaint on August 22 and questioned the lab in-charge, R.P. Shinde, and Prof. Pillai, the institutes additional director. The police have summoned students who used the computer around December. We have seized two computer central processing units in which the photographs were stored, Dabhade said.

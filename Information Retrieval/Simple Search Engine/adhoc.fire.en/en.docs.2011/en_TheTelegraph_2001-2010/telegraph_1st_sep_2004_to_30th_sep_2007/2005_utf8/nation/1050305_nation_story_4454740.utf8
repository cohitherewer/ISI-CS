 Apex court scanner on govt ads

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 4: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre, 17 ministers and the Congress-ruled states of Punjab, Karnataka, Uttaranchal and Delhi on a public interest litigation charging the governments with ?squandering? public money on advertisements. 

 A division bench of Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti and Justice D.M. Dharmadhikari sought an explanation on the allegation that crores were being spent on ?eulogising? leaders like the late Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and M. Karunanidhi.

 The PIL sought a directive from the court to these governments and ministries to produce records of expenditure incurred and details of recovery. 

 The lawsuit by two Supreme Court advocates, Manzoor Ali Khan and Rohit Pandey, contended that the Centre, the states and their various agencies were ?misusing? public money to enhance the image of their leaders.

 It said this amounted to ?misappropriation? and ?misuse? of public money and pointed out that various Union ministries and the four Congress-ruled states issued huge advertising on the 60th birth anniversary of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

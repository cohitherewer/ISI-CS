 Farooq plea

 Srinagar, Aug. 5: National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah has sought Jammu and Kashmir High Courts intervention for permission to repair and spruce up his fathers mausoleum on the banks of Dal Lake.

 Farooqs father and the founder of the National Conference, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, was buried in the Naseem Bagh area.

 The petition moved by Farooq, which came up for hearing before the court today, said his father had bought a plot in the Naseem Bagh area and was buried there in accordance with his will.

 Farooq said his requests for carrying out repairs at a platform near the grave had been turned down by the Lakes and Waterways Authority, which had imposed a ban on concrete structures in and around Dal Lake.

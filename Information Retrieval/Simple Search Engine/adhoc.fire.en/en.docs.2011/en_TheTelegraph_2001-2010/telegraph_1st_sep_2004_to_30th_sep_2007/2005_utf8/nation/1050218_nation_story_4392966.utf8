 Rape slur on principals

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: A 16-year-old student of a Delhi government school was allegedly gangraped by her school principal, another principal and two others, reports our correspondent. 

 A case was registered at Badli police station in northwest Delhi early today after her parents complained. 

 The Delhi government has suspended 

 the principals, O.P. Sharma of Raghubir Nagar Middle School 

 and Ved Prakash of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Patel Nagar. 

 The Class X student used to take tuitions from Sharma. She had told him she was afraid of failing the examination and sought help. Sharma promised to arrange a meeting with another teacher. 

 On Saturday night, the two principals picked her up in a car and drove to a guest house, stopping on the way to pick up two acquaintances. The four allegedly sexually assaulted the teenager.

 Panic bubbles out of peril patch

 Nagapattinam, Dec. 24: Sudden eruption of air bubbles in some water-soaked paddy fields near Mayiladuthurai has kept officials in Nagapattinam district, the most devastated area in Tamil Nadu by last years tsunami, on their toes with just two days to go for the first anniversary of the tragedy.

 The bubbles have been intermittently springing up from underneath, splashing across the water level in some paddy fields in Thirumangalam since yesterday, causing panic among people. A similar phenomenon was seen in ponds in the Poompuhar coastal hamlet in the district, just an hour before the tsunami struck last year. 

 Even as a team of officials, including those from the departments of geology and mining, agriculture and PWD, rushed to inspect the area after local farmer Manoharan had informed the authorities, no conclusion could be drawn immediately, official sources here said. 

 The unflappable Nagapattinam district collector, J. Radhakrishnan, sees no cause for alarm as it is now possible to get a two-hour advance warning about a tsunami.

 Radhakrishnan, who is shepherding the massive reconstruction task and organising various events to mark the first anniversary of the tsunami, said: I am really happy the way things are bouncing back. Just one year ago, Nagapattinam looked like a graveyard.

 The collector spoke, watching affectionately over a painting competition organised for children orphaned by the tsunami. They are a bundle of energy now, he said, turning to the children of the Annai Sathya orphanage, mostly girls feverishly painting on a 72-foot-long canvas outside the collectors office. 

 The kids jump in joy seeing the collector and call him appa (father).

 The best way to remember the tsunami victims is to pledge ourselves to meet any disaster, he said.

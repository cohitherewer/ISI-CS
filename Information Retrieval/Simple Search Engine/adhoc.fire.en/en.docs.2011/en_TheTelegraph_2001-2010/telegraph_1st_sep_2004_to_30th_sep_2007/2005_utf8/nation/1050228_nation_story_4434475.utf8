 Sonia, clerics in focus

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: Ram Vilas Paswan might not be averse to supporting a Muslim chief minister from the Rashtriya Janata Dal, with a deputy from his party. 

 The Lok Janshakti Party chief, who has insisted on keeping equal distance from Laloo Prasad Yadav?s RJD and the National Democratic Alliance and called for President?s rule, could climb down under pressure from Sonia Gandhi and senior Muslim clerics. 

 Besides, the ?kingmaker? would be worried about some of his MLAs being susceptible to poaching by both camps. 

 The newly-formed LJP?s election symbol is a ?house?, but some of his nominees could not get the symbol and had to contest on others, turning them into Independents, who are easier to wean away.

 LJP sources said with a large section of Muslims, especially the backwards and the Dalits, drifting away from Laloo Prasad?s ?MY? (Muslim-Yadav) combination, and with Paswan crafting a ?DM? (Dalit-Muslim) alliance with upper castes, it would be politically suicidal for him to have any truck with the saffron camp. 

 With cracks in the RJD?s ?Muslim-Yadav? combination, either Paswan or Nitish Kumar could emerge as a future alternative to Laloo Prasad in the state.

 In the run-up to the elections, Paswan had said he would like to have a Muslim chief minister but he did not specify the party. 

 Sources in the LJP said RJD?s state president and former minister Abdul Bahri Siddiqui could emerge as a consensus candidate for the top slot while Paswan?s brother Pasupati Paras could be the deputy chief minister. ?As of now, this option is the only alternative to President?s rule,? a source said.

 RJD sources said though Laloo Prasad will insist on Rabri Devi continuing as chief minister, he could also back a Muslim candidate to placate the minority community.

 Assessing the initial reports, they said between 20 and 40 per cent Muslims seem to have split away from the RJD in different regions, and rebel Yadavs ruined the party?s prospects in two dozen seats.

 Discounting the possibility of the NDA cobbling a majority, a senior RJD leader said that in 2000, Nitish Kumar?s government fell after seven days as he could not muster support from Independents even though the NDA was in power at the Centre. 

 ?If the BJP-JD (U) make a similar attempt, they are bound to fail. Not only is there a UPA government at the Centre, governor Buta Singh, a former Congress leader, is also no pushover,? he said. 

 Both Laloo Prasad and Siwan MP and muscleman Mohammad Shahabuddin are adept at ?managing? Independent legislators. 

 In the first two phases, LJP gained at the cost of the RJD and in the third phase, it damaged the NDA more. Though Laloo Prasad tried his best to create a BJP phobia in the third phase, analysts said it was too late as the damage was already done in the second phase, which had the maximum Muslim presence.

 Most constituencies in the second phase had a high concentration of minority voters, who appeared to have divided their loyalty between the LJP-Congress and the RJD. 

 Kishenganj has a 67.6 per cent Muslim population, Katihar 42.5 per cent, Araria 41.1 per cent, Purnea 36.8 per cent, Darbhanga 22.7 per cent, Madhubani 17.9 per cent and Supaul 17.4 per cent. Another half-a-dozen constituencies in the second phase had 4.4 per cent to 14.4 per cent minority voters.

 MLAs to pay for spouse trips

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 12: From now on, legislators in Orissa will have to pay for taking their spouses along on study tours.

 In its latest report, the Assembly committee on ethics had recommended that spouses could accompany MLAs only during medical emergencies, with the prior approval of the Speaker. Legislatures found violating the pay code, as recommended by the committee, should be debarred from undertaking study tours in future. The budget session of the Assembly, which ended last week, has approved the recommendations.

 Headed by Berhampur MLA Ramesh Chandra Chyau Patnaik, the 10-member committee has suggested that the spouse or attendant of an MLA should not accompany the Assembly committee member during study visits and informal discussions with officials of the organisations concerned.

 The committee recommended that every member of the House should declare his or her assets and liabilities to the Speaker within 90 days of taking oath and continue to do so, on or before 15th of January every year, while in office. Whenever a member has a personal or monetary interest (direct or indirect) in a matter being considered by the Assembly, he or she will have to declare the nature of such interest. The MLA shall not participate in any debate in the Assembly or its committee before making the declaration.

 A member having personal interest in a matter may also lose his voting right in case of a division of vote on that matter. If a member is found concealing his or her personal interest in a particular matter, the Speaker may censure, reprimand or suspend that MLA.

 The ethics committee had also suggested that MLAs cannot use official vehicles for private trips while undertaking a study tour nor can they accept any gift during such visits. 

 The Assembly has also made some changes in its day-to-day functioning. The House will convene at 10.30 am and end at 7 pm. The Speaker can extend the working hours to 9 pm in cases of emergency. Besides, the House will sit for at least 60 days a year. The budget discussion will be conducted on the lines of the one in the Lok Sabha.

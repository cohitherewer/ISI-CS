 Mandela sues Indian lawyer

 Mandela: Guarding legacy

 Durban, May 11 (Agencies): Nelson Mandela has filed a lawsuit against his former lawyer of Indian origin and a businessman for allegedly swindling millions of dollars by illegally using his name and selling artworks recalling his long years in prison.

 My name and reputation are, and will continue to be, harmed by the injurious and unlawful actions, the 86-year-old anti-apartheid icon said in an application to Johannesburg High Court yesterday.

 I am desirous to create and leave a legacy of moral rectitude, care for the disadvantaged group of persons in our society, dignity for all, regardless of race, colour, creed or station in society, Mandela said, adding that his former lawyer Ismael Ayob and businessman Ross Calder were injurious to his legacy.

 I suffer and will continue to suffer immeasurable damage to my name and reputation. The gains which now have been achieved through the Nelson Mandela Foundation, the Nelson Mandela Childrens Fund and other charity organisations would be in vain should the actions of Calder and Ayob, and the companies under their control, not be immediately interdicted.

 The former South Africa President has asked the court to stop Ayob from using his name which is his copyright. He has also asked the court to remove Ayob and his wife from all positions in the Nelson Mandela Trust, NRM Family Trust and the Mandela Trust.

 Mandela also wanted Ayob to produce audited financial statements of the money that went into the trusts and the list of companies to which he sold the works of art bearing his signature.

 Mandela, who spent 27 years in jail ? most of them at the infamous Robben Island prison off Cape Town, was released in 1990 and decided to collaborate with an artist to produce limited-edition paintings which he signed, his long-time friend and lawyer George Bizos said.

 Bizos ruled out any out-of-court settlement with Calder, as the businessman had claimed in a newspaper. He (Calder) has attempted to negotiate but we have not responded because the stopping of the sale of the works is not negotiable.

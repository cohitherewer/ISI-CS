 Temple town to get facelift

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, April 9: The narrow lanes could get roomier and the squalor on the roads a thing of the past.

 Ayodhya is set for a facelift, with the Uttar Pradesh government deciding to repackage the temple town to change its image of a communal flashpoint ? as the western media has described it ? to a tourist destination.

 As part of efforts to draw tourists ? both foreign and domestic ? the state has planned a massive complex near the bank of the Sarayu. 

 Visitors can view a chronological account of Ram?s life and see on screen key events from the Ramayana in different Indian and foreign languages. 

 A museum, to protect copies of invaluable ancient scripts that trace the cultural history of Ayodhya, is part of the plans.

 The state government, which is waiting for central approval for the Rs 200-crore project, is also planning a handicraft colony near the river. Works of local artisans involved with the cottage industry would be on display in the colony, which will be named ?Shilpa Gram?.

 Central permission is mandatory for any project within Ayodhya because of the town?s importance and its communally sensitive nature. The state expects the Centre to bear 50 per cent of the cost.

 The beautification drive includes a new township, which is already coming up on the town?s outskirts. 

 Another project involves a crocodile hatchery, for which the state?s forest and wildlife department is expected to join hands with tourism officers. The hatchery, near Katarnia Ghat of the Sarayu, will breed crocodiles and nurture them for two years before shifting them to other sanctuaries.

 A team of senior state tourism officers, led by the department?s secretary, Rita Sinha, visited the temple town and inspected a 30-acre plot allotted for the beautification efforts. Sinha told reporters the state government would soon start the project with an initial allocation of Rs 5 crore.

 ?Ayodhya has more history than what it is now known for,? said Partha Sensharma, the director-general of Uttar Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation. ?The object of the project is to showcase that for the tourists.?

 Sants and mahants, who play an important part in the affairs of the pilgrim city, have welcomed the government?s drive. 

 ?We welcome the project,? said Mahant Gyan Das, the chief of the All India Akhara Parishad. ?We believe there is a need to tell the world about the importance of Ayodhya in India. The projects will help change the image of this temple town.?

 Before it grabbed headlines one December morning 12 years ago, Ayodhya was a sleepy little town. After the Babri mosque was razed, most forgot that it was once an important trading centre whose image as a ?Hindu Vatican? had, according to historians, begun to grow since medieval times.

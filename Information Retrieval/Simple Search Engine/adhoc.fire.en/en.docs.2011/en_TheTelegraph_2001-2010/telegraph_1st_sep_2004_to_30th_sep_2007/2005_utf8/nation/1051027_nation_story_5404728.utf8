 PM pledge on Nepal 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has told a team of Left leaders from Nepal that resumption of military aid to the Royal Nepal Army will be considered only after evidence that steps were being taken to restore democracy in the Himalayan kingdom, a member of the delegation said.

 This comes a day after the Nepal army chief returned to Kathmandu from a week-long visit to China yesterday and said Beijing had pledged military assistance in its war against the Maoists, a development that the Indian military establishment has noted with some concern.

 The team from the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist), led by its general secretary and former deputy Prime Minister, Madhav Kumar Nepal, was here chiefly to convince the Indian establishment that it must abandon its conventional po-licy of supporting both the monarchy and the political parties in Nepal. 

 We have told the Indian Prime Minister, the defence minister, the home minister and the foreign minister that democracy must take precedence over everything, given the situation in Nepal. This monarchy must be subject to democracy. We are very satisfied with the hearing we were given, Rajan Bhattarai, a member of the CPN (UML)s international affairs department, said.

 Sources in the Indian military establishment were still analysing the visit of the Nepal army chief, General Pyar Jung Thapa, who also enjoys honorary status as Indian army chief, to Beijing at the invitation of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army.

 Indian military sources said Kathmandu was scouring world markets to reinforce its army whose stockpile of ammunition is running out of bullets for India-supplied INSAS rifles among other firepower. 

 They noted that the Nepal army chief had described China as a friend after the visit and that Beijing had committed ? according to the claim of the Nepalese military ? funds of Nepali Rs 75 million (about Indian Rs 45 million). 

 Thapa said this amount would be used to strengthen the army.

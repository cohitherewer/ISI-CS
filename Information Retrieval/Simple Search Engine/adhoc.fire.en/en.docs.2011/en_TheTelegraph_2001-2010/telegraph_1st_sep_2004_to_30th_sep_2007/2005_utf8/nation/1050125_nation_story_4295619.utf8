 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 24: The British deputy high commission in Calcutta today started its weeklong training programme for working journalists from eastern India here today. 

 The programme, called A balanced media ? Facing the challenge, is being conducted by Norrie Drummond, a UK-based trainer from the Thomson Foundation, Wales.

 Inaugurating the workshop, state minister for information and public relations Debashis Nayak emphasised the need for sustained training of media professionals. 

 This is the fourth in a series of training programme organised by the high commission in the eastern region. Over two dozen journalists from Sikkim, Chhattisgarh and Orissa are taking part.

 Drummond, an experienced journalist, has helped run courses for the Thomson Foundation in a number of countries. He is in the middle of one such programme for Afghanistan journalists in Kabul.

 Speaking about the workshop, first secretary and head of the press and communication department of the British High Commission Jeff Wilson said the workshop was being organised at the request of the journalists and editors from the region. 

 The first such workshop was conducted in Guwahati in 2000 and the second in Shillong in September 2002 and then in Kohima in January last year.

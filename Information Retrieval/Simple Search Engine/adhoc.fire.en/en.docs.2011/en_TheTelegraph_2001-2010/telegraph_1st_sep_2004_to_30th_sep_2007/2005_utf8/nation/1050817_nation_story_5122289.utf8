 New Delhi, Aug. 16: The army has allocated a strike corps to the new command carved out along the western boundary with Pakistan but it is not immediately relocating offensive elements close to the border.

 The assigning of a strike force to the Jaipur-based South-Western Command is in line with a new doctrine the army is shaping. So far it was known that army headquarters had assigned only a holding (defensive) corps to the command.

 A strike corps is an army headquarters reserve. It is a large formation that integrates mobile armoured and mechanised forces with artillery and infantry divisions and is supposed to be technically equipped to act in conjunction with the air force. A strike corps can be cast in several roles ? offensive, defensive or counter-offensive.

 The movement of strike corps close to the border can be interpreted as a potential threat and lead to a diplomatic row. This is why army headquarters is chary of publicising any movement of elements of its strike corps. 

 Although the intention to create the South-Western Command was evident last year, the Centre cleared the proposal of army headquarters for its new field army only in February this year. The command was made operational yesterday.

 Its area of responsibility has been carved out of the Chandimandir-headquartered Western Command and the Jodhpur-headquartered Southern Command. Lt Gen. K. Nagaraj is the first chief of the South-Western Command.

 The commands insignia is described in an official statement as a silver streak symbolising offensive action with a seven-pointed star heralding the seventh command of the Indian Army.

 The area of responsibility covers the neighbourhood of Abohar and Fazilka in southern Punjab and Bikaner and Ganganagar districts of Rajasthan. This is the northern belt of the desert zone

 So far, the main features of the restructuring of army formations along the western boundary have involved:

 Splitting up the forces under the Nagrota-headquartered 16 Corps. By some accounts, the 16 corps used to be the largest army corps in the world. Now, some mobile elements of 16 corps have been assigned to 9 corps.

 While the 16 corps continues to be under the Northern Command, its responsibilities on the boundary in the plains have been taken over by 9 corps that is in the Western Command

 With the South-Western command becoming operational, the Western Commands area of responsibility will now be the international boundary between Pathankot and Jammu 

 The Northern Command will be relieved of duties near the international boundary and try to ensure the security of the 742 km-Line of Control and the border with China in Ladakh.

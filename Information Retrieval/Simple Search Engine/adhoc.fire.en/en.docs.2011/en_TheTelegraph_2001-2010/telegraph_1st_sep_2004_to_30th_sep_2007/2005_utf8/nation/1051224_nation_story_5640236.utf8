 Most go missing, two wag finger

 New Delhi, Dec. 23: As the Parliament axe fell, two of the tainted 11 members cried foul against the verdict and threatened to move court.

 However, most of the other MPs ? caught on camera accepting cash for asking questions ? went underground. Some of them reportedly got busy planning to put up a joint fight.

 As the two Houses debated on their fate, almost all the 11 MPs were spotted in the Central Hall of Parliament. 

 Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee had appealed to them to stay away from the proceedings. After the verdict was pronounced separately in the two Houses, they quietly walked out.

 The Bahujan Samaj Partys Rajaram Pal later complained that the MPs had not been allowed to present their case on the floor of the House. 

 Dubbing the sting operation a big conspiracy, he said: I will go to the public and the court.

 The expelled MP also claimed that his case was different from that of others as he had alerted the Speaker last month about his meeting with a mysterious official. 

 Pal said he had written to Chatterjee on November 14, informing him that a woman impersonating as a company official had met him with requests to raise questions in Parliament.

 The BSP MP said he had sent the letter through registered post four days after his meeting with the woman who called herself Namita Malhotra. Pal, who showed copies of postal registration slips, however, did not produce any acknowledgement of his letter by the Lok Sabha.

 BJP MP from Chhattisgarh Pradeep Gandhi alleged that he had been falsely implicated. Definitely we will go to court?. This was a conspiracy of the Congress, he said.

 However, the nine others caught in the scam were untraceable. Sources indicated the MPs might resurface tomorrow and disclose their strategy. A close associate of one of the BJP MPs hinted that he was seeking legal opinion.

 Pondicherry, May 31: Union home minister Shivraj Patil today announced that the Centre would spend over Rs 500 crore, in the initial phase, to set up a full-fledged coastal security machinery.

 Some states, including Tamil Nadu, had mooted the proposal. The minister today attended the 23rd meeting of the southern zonal council (SZC), comprising members from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the Union territories of Pondicherry and Lakshadweep.

 The chief ministers and ministers of the southern states in their three-hour meeting agreed on the need to have nodal officers, to be appointed by each state, to facilitate better co-ordination among the states in tackling terrorist activities. 

 Patil said one of the new things to happen was the establishment of the coastal machinery. He said the project would include new police stations at vantage points along the countrys coastline.

 The coastal security police would be assisted by the coast guard and would be given boats to provide security to people living on the coasts. 

 Patil said todays participants, including Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa, were emphatic on the need to strengthen the intelligence-gathering machinery. He said the nodal officers to be appointed by the states for security matters and related issues will liaise among themselves. 

 The meeting also focussed on the Naxalite problem which has hit Andhra Pradesh the hardest. Patil commended the Andhra governments policy of keeping the doors open for the rebels for talks. 

 This is acceptable to all of us, the home minister said, adding that at the same time states must strengthen their police force, expand and modernise it, besides improving communication facilities and ensuring better co-ordination with neighbouring states. 

 Absentee CMs 

 Apart from Jayalalithaa, Pondicherrys N. Rangaswamy was the only other chief minister to attend todays meeting. 

 The chief ministers of Congress-ruled Andhra, Kerala and Karnataka stayed away. Kerala deputed its revenue and law minister K.M. Mani. Andhra was represented by home minister Jana Reddy and finance minister K. Rosiah. Karnataka revenue minister M.P. Prakash attended the meeting. 

 The Union home minister did not have any explanation for the absence of the chief ministers.

 He, however, said the chief ministers of Karnataka and Kerala were busy with elections in their states.

 Bypolls to the Shimoga Lok Sabha and Chamarajpet Assembly constituencies of Karnataka will be held on Thursday.

 Patil said Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy was in constant touch with the Centre.

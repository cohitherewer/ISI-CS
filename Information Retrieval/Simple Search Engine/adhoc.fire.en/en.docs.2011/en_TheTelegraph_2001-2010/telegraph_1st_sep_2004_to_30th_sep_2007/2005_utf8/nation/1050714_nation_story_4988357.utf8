 Assaulted Sikh sues Americans

New York (Agencies): A 55-year-old Sikh has filed a lawsuit 

against five persons accusing them of thrashing him and causing multiple fractures. 

 Rajinder Singh Khalsa, who runs a car service in the citys suburbs, was left unconscious outside a restaurant on July 11, 2004. 

 Khalsa, who emigrated from India in 1996, said as a result of the beating he lost vision in his left eye, suffered a crushed nose and required surgery on an eye socket. He said he owes thousands of dollars in treatment as he had no health insurance.

 Its been many months and still I am feeling pain, he said while talking to reporters in the lower Manhattan office of a Sikh rights group. My eyesight changed. My life changed. When anybody looks at my turban or at my face, I am scared, maybe they are going to beat me. 

 Khalsa has sought damages as he was unable to return to work for several months. 

 Four men from Long Island and one from Queens were arrested in August and indicted on charges of second-degree assault and harassment in connection with the attack, which police said was hate crime. 

 The four, scheduled to go on trial in October, will face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. 

 Khalsas lawsuit has also sought unspecified damages from the Villa Russo restaurant, outside which he was attacked. 

 Attorney Amardeep Singh, the legal director of the rights group, said the eatery is being sued under a law that bars restaurants from serving alcohol to people already intoxicated. The lawsuit alleges that the attackers had been drinking in the restaurant.

 Singh said the community has suffered dozens of hate crimes in this city and hundreds across the country since September 11, 2001.

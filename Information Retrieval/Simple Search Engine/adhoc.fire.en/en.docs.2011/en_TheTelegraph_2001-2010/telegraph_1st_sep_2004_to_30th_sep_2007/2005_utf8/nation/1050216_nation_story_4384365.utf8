 Geelani probe cry in SC

 New Delhi: S.A.R. Geelani has approached 

 the Supreme Court seeking an investigation by ?an independent 

 agency?, and not Delhi police, into the assault on him, 

 reports our legal correspondent.

 The division bench of Justices P. Venkatarama Reddi and P.P. Naolekar briefly heard the petition, which also expressed lack of faith in Delhi police, and sought their response.

 Gopal Subramanyam, senior counsel for the police, told the court that Geelani?s statement was obtained only on Monday and a status report would ?anyway? be filed by next Tuesday, when the petition could be taken up.

 Kamini Jaiswal, counsel for the Delhi University lecturer, sought a hearing on Tuesday itself and the issuance of a notice to the police.

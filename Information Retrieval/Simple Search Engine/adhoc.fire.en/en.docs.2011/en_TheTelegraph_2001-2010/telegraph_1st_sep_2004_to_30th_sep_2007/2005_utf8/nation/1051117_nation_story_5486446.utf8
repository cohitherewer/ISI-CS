 Hunt for wife of don, with cash and clues

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Nov. 16: She is by all accounts the first woman in Abu Salems life and the reason behind his first brush with the law ? for love.

 Now the supposedly dumped first wife has emerged the mystery other woman in the case, with the CBI launching a hunt for the America-based Samira Jumani through Interpol.

 The agency and police are doubtful whether Salem has indeed divorced the 31-year-old Samira or whether the claim is a ploy to distance her from his crimes.

 Salems properties are either in the name of Neha Asif Jafri or Sabina Azmi, both aliases on Samiras forged passports, a CBI source said. The first wife ? the mother of Salems eight-old-year son ? is believed to be in charge of Salems properties in the US that are apparently worth several billions.

 CBI sleuths suspect that it was Samira who handled Salems legal expenses during his extradition trial in Portugal. There has been a similar mystery over who appointed the counsels now defending the don in India.

 Salem has no bank accounts in India and the CBI, with the aid of Interpol, has already disabled the accounts he held abroad under his own name or aliases, along with those of Monica Bedi. But those held by Samira havent been identified yet.

 Though Salem often refers to Monica as his wife, investigators say they are yet to come across any documents that prove their marriage.

 But it certainly is not so with Samira, who is possibly twice married to Salem: once as a minor and later as an adult.

 Way back in 1991, Salem had married Samira, then a college student and a minor, against the wishes of her family. He was a small-time crook then. After Samiras furious parents lodged a police complaint, Salem was arrested and released on bail.

 A year later, when Samira turned 18, she and Salem got legally married with her uncles help. This was just six months before the Mumbai blasts of March 12, 1993.

 After the blasts, Salem fled India. Samira left in the late 1990s with the help of a forged passport, organised by Salem from Hyderabad, in the name of Neha Asif Jafri. She apparently has another passport in the name of Sabina Azmi from Lucknow.

 Yet, when the CBI extradited Salem from Portugal, they found in his possession legal papers relating to divorce proceedings with Samira.

 It is believed that Salem, had nearly a decade-long romantic liaison with the starlet.What took him so long to consider a divorce with Samira? A CBI official said it was Salems ploy to keep her and his son out of the prying eyes of the intelligence agencies.

 Similar stories about a divorce were spread also before she fled to the US, a top Mumbai police officer added.

 The CBI had issued an Interpol red-corner notice against Samira in 2000. The notice lists several offences: criminal conspiracy, fraud and dishonestly-induced delivery of property, forgery and the use of forged documents as genuine.

 The agency has now sent fresh details, including phone numbers and addresses supplied by the Mumbai police, to Interpol.

 She would at the very least be a goldmine of information on Salem, a CBI source said.

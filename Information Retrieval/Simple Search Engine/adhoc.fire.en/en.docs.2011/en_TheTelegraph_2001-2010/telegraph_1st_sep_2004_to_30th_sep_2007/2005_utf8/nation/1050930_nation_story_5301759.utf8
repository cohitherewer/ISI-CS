The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Were not poking nose, says Yechury

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kathmandu, Sept. 29: The Indian politicians visiting Nepal today said they were in the troubled kingdom merely to express solidarity with the pro-democracy movement, but it was for the people to decide which system they wanted.

 The clarification came a day after some 150 supporters of Nepals royalist government threw stones at the cars of the political team, led by CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury.

 Down with foreign interference, the demonstrators had shouted as the visitors drove from the airport. 

 Yechury, who held talks with senior leaders of the seven-party alliance spearheading the pro-democracy movement, told reporters his team had come to extend moral support.

 We would like to express our utmost support and solidarity to the democratic movement launched by the democratic parties. But it is for the Nepalese people to decide which political system they want to establish in their country, he said, adding that the delegation had formally invited the alliance leaders to visit India.

 CPI secretary D. Raja, a member of the team, dismissed allegations that the Indians were interfering in Nepals internal affairs. We do not agree with such allegations. Democracy and human rights issues are integral parts of civil society. So we extend our moral support and solidarity for any democratic movement that may take place in any part of the globe, he said.

 Responding to questions, Raja said King Gyanendra, who seized power in a February 1 coup, must take note of popular concerns. But, like Yechury, he added that it was for the people of Nepal to decide what system they want.

 Nepali Congress (Democratic) spokesperson Minendra Rijal said Yechury and his team recalled the role played by Nepalese leaders during Indias independence struggle and added that people of both countries shared similar views on freedom and democracy.

 Earlier in the day the visitors met CPN-UML leaders at the partys office. Its general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal thanked the Indian leaders for their support to the democracy movement.

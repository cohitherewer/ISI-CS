The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Destitute girls wait for aid 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Port Blair, Dec. 31: On New Year?s Eve, as 

much of the world gets ready for celebrations, Supriya and Balsara munch muri 

because they have not seen rice for four days.

 The girls aged two and three are among 48 destitute inmates of a home who have been virtually starving since the tsunamis struck on December 26.

 They live in a building tucked into a hillock, on AIR Road, barely 2.5 km from the district collector?s office, which is the centre of all relief distribution for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. But the administration appears hardly bothered about them. 

 Making matters worse is the building of the home, run by the Pranab Kanya Sangha, that is cracked and crumbling after the disaster. The inmates have been forced to sleep in makeshift tents on the hillock. ?I am very scared at night because there is no secure wall. Most of us stay awake,? said Vineeta, 16, who is preparing for her board examinations.

 Home secretary Sanyasini Dhyanandamoyee said she made several trips to the authorities without success. 

 ?They said they don?t have any reserves for the young girls. Even our headquarters in Calcutta promised aid, but so far there hasn?t been any,? said a distressed Dhyanandamoyee. The home was opened in 1992.

 Sarita, an inmate, recalled the day the ground shook and the tsunamis lashed Port Blair. ?Our building developed huge cracks and with the tremors continuing, we had to run out,? she said.

 The girls stayed out in the open the first night. ?When I told them (authorities), they said they could do little as all the relief material was for Car Nicobar,? Dhyanandamoyee said. A tarpaulin was finally spared.

 ?The children were crying for rice? how long could they go without it?? said Pratima Choudhury, a social worker who accompanied the secretary to lieutenant governor Ram Khapse. Khapse met them and promised relief before nightfall. The girls, too, appealed. 

 But Supriya and Nikita, 5, are still not sure when they will be served a plate of rice.

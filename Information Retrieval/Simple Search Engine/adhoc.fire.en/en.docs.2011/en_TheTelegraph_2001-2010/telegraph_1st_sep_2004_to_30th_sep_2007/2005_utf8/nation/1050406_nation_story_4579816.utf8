 Debt no bar for generous Gaur 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Gaur

 Bhopal, April 5: Madhya Pradesh may be carrying a big debt but it has a bigger heart.

 The state government continued to dole out largesse to politicians cutting across party lines, ignoring the burden of over Rs 40,000 crore in debt.

 Chief minister Babulal Gaur yesterday got his cabinet?s seal of approval on a sop shower on former chief ministers. They will get palatial bungalows, official cars, telephones, personal assistants and security paraphernalia.

 Senior officials in the state secretariat said the move came on account of a ?discrepancy? in earlier rule books that envisaged giving concessions to only those former chief ministers who were either MLAs or MPs. 

 This scratched out Sunderlal Patwa from the list of beneficiaries. But Gaur could not afford to rub the senior BJP leader the wrong way. Patwa enjoys tremendous clout in the state.

 The ailing BJP leader is seen as a balancing factor between Gaur and arch rival Uma Bharti and has been trying to broker peace between the warring factions. 

 Recently, he acted as Gaur?s rescuer when Uma?s supporters faxed letters to BJP chief L.K. Advani to remove him.

 However, the bounty has been restricted to the state. Former chief ministers who are now in Chhattisgarh and are no longer ?ordinary residents? of Madhya Pradesh have been left out. This means Shyama Charan Shukla and Motilal Vora will not get the new perks.

 A proposal was mooted to extend the facility to the neighbouring state that was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 1999.

 ?You see as elder brother, we have greater responsibility and (are) expected to show magnanimity,? a minister said, adding that a ?few lakhs? a year would not make much difference to the ?vicious cycle of debts and losses?. But the proposal was dropped after resistance from some other members of the cabinet.

 The benevolence has come in spite of the fact that the Madhya Pradesh government has been selling off state-owned public sector units to reduce debts. 

 The state has recently shut down two state-owned units ? the Madhya Pradesh Road Transport Corporation and the Oilseed Federation ? rendering thousands jobless. 

 The government has also refused to re-employ over 500 workers who were forcefully transferred to Chhattisgarh, prompting many to take legal recourse. 

 The two states are still at loggerheads over distribution of assets and liabilities and have even moved the Supreme Court for adjudication.

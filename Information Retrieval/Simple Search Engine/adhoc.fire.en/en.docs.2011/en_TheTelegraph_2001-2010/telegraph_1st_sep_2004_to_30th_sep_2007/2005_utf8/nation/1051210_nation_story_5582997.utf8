 Convict gives cops the slip

 New Delhi: A convict, who boasted about 

 committing 104 murders, escaped from police custody on Wednesday 

 while being taken to court, reports our correspondent.

 Deepak Jat gave the slip to at least 30 policemen who were escorting 80 inmates from Ghaziabad jail to the Noida Phase II courts.

 According to Noida police, the 27-year-old criminal was a carjacker against whom 42 cases had been lodged. Jat, however, would often tell the media that he had killed 104 people.

 Barely 5 feet 3 inches tall and of slim built, Jat had a specific modus operandi. He would hire cars and, with the help of his associates, kill the drivers by slitting their throats with thin strips of wire. After dumping the drivers body, Jat and his gang ? named D8 by the police ? would steal the car and the drivers belongings.

 TEN challenges DD diktat

 Calcutta: Sports broadcaster TEN Sports 

 has moved Bombay High Court challenging the Centres 

 decision of making it compulsory for sports channels to 

 share cricket matches featuring India with national broadcaster 

 Doordarshan, says a staff reporter.

 Its writ petition says the company would suffer huge financial losses on the one day series between India and Pakistan scheduled to be held in Pakistan in January, if it has to share the exclusive telecast rights.

 The matter is scheduled to come up for hearing on December 12.

 Delhi blast 

 New Delhi: Mohammad Rafiq Shah, arrested 

 on suspicion of being the militant who placed a bomb on 

 a Govindpuri-bound bus in October, has refused to stand 

 for a test identification parade. 

 Shah is reportedly close to main accused Tariq Ahmed Dar, who is in police custody. His refusal will make the prosecution case strong, said an official.

 Hema piracy bill

 New Delhi: Hema Malini introduced a 

 private members legislation in the Rajya Sabha on 

 Friday seeking stringent punishment to those involved in 

 video piracy that plagues the film industry. A private members 

 bill may not become a law but the government can take note 

 of it.

 was hospitalised after they suffered heart attacks while 

 participating in a 100-metre race hosted by a school. Both

 Nine-year-old Alka Ajith from Kerala will lead a 25-member troupe 

 to the Gulf in December on a 45-day tour. Alka has done

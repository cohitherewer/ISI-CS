 Melting pot of B-school brains

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Nov. 7: Come November 24, top B-school brains in India and abroad would converge at IIM Ahmedabad for a four-day event for a test of their managerial skills and prize money worth Rs 16 lakh.

 Confluence 2005, which began seven years ago, has become an annual global business school meet where students compete, debate contemporary managerial issues and generate ideas, some of which are later incorpora- ted in policy decisions by industries and government agencies.

 At the end of the meet on November 27, the winners will walk away with awards while the prize money will be distributed among the top three teams.

 This year, nearly 100 students from leading business schools and more than 500 management institutes in the country are expected to participate, said a member of the IIMA confluence team.

 The meet will see industry leaders like J.J. Irani, Kumarmangalam Birla and Mukesh Ambani engage in a series of interactive discussions with the participants. 

 Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia will also take part in the discussions.

 The competitive events for the meet kicked off with MasterPlan and Livestock. While the former is about investment plans to test the business skills of participants, the other allows students to invest real money and get real returns on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 In Masterplan, which saw 345 submissions from 42 domestic and 17 international business schools, including Harvard, participants are required to present business plans involving investment of up to US $5 billion. The total prize money is $11,000.

 The entries were screened by senior executives from Ernst and Young, a global leader in professional services. The top six teams will present their plans before a panel during the event. Of these, the top three will have the opportunity to present their ideas to Ambani, who will decide the winner.

 The meet also includes a case contest. The best case paper, with solutions to specific problems faced by Ahmedabad city, will become a road map for civic authorities and is likely to implemented by municipal commissioner Anil Mukhim, who was managing director of Gujarat Infotic Limited. It was his idea to start a case contest so that the best ideas could be incorporated in the states IT policy.

 With the state government projecting Ahmedabad as a peaceful, business-friendly city, Mukhim, as civic chief, has promised IIMA students that the best ideas will be implemented to make it more beautiful.

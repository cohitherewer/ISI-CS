 Thackeray ends hit- amp;-run silence

 Mumbai: Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray 

 has expressed condolences in a signed letter to the families 

 of victims of a hit-and-run involving his personal assistant, 

 reports our special correspondent. 

 The letter broke the Thackeray family?s silence over the accident on Saturday, in which Ravindra Mhatre had hit four persons waiting at a bus stop here, killing two women and injuring two men.

 The letter was personally delivered to the families of 75-year-old Leela Mashelkar and 55-year-old Sheela Pawaskar by the Shiv Sena?s executive president, Uddhav Thackeray, and senior leader Manohar Joshi on Thursday. 

 Evoking memories of his personal tragedies, 

 Thackeray wrote: ?Everyone is born with a warrant of death. 

 Which way will you die and when is difficult to predict. 

 I have also been through this.? He referred to the death 

 of his eldest son Bindumadhav Thackeray in a car accident 

 near Lonavala, and the death of his wife Meenatai in a heart 

 attack a few years ago.

 Police have, however, asked the regional transport office (RTO) to cancel the driving licence of Thackeray?s personal assistant Mhatre. 

 ?Vile Parle police have sent a letter to the RTO asking it to cancel his licence as he was involved in a fatal mishap,? deputy commissioner of police Bipin Kumar Singh said. This is a normal procedure followed by the police in road accident cases, he added.

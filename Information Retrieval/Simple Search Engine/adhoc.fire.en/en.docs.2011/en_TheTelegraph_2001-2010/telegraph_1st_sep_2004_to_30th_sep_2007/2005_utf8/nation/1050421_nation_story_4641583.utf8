 Dowry on Muslim board plate

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Nadvi: Reform focus

 Bhopal, April 20: Under pressure to accelerate reforms, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has decided to spread awareness against dowry, acknowledging its prevalence in the community across the country. 

 The board is meeting in Bhopal on April 29 and 30 when it is expected to come up with a plan to check the rise of dowry.

 In a communication to the board executive preparing the agenda for the Bhopal meet, board chief Maulana Rabey Nadvi said dowry demands were against the Shariat and, therefore, should have no place in the community. Nadvi added that given the low socio-economic indicators among Muslims, there was a pressing need to create awareness in matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. 

 The law board, which is the apex religious body of Muslims in the country, has recently come under cloud over the setting up of several parallel organisations on sectarian and gender basis. 

 The board?s move to launch the anti-dowry drive and provide a thrust to social reforms is seen as attempts to refurbish its image. 

 In the letter to the agenda committee, Nadvi wrote: ?There is a pressing need to work out a strategy to take on social evils like dowry, which has to be dealt with firmly before it infects the social fabric.?

 The scholar, belonging to the Lucknow-based theological school Darul-Ulum-Nadwa, said the board should prevail upon qazis to focus on simple marriages to drive home the point that dowry should be banished. 

 Quoting various studies, Nadvi claimed that there was a ?disturbing trend? that Muslims from groom?s side have started demanding dowry. 

 ?The dowry practice has been affecting Muslim society and must be discouraged,? the board chief wrote. 

 The Bhopal conclave will clear a model nikaahnama (marriage contract) that is a longstanding demand of liberals and women?s rights groups. The contract has been designed enlisting details and circumstances under which a marriage can be annulled. 

 While the move has generally been hailed from all quarters, many in the board, including Nadvi, feel that there is a greater need to create awareness so that the nikaahnama is implemented in letter and spirit. 

 Sources said the board has received scores of complaints where qazis who are empowered to arbitrate have erred while imparting justice.

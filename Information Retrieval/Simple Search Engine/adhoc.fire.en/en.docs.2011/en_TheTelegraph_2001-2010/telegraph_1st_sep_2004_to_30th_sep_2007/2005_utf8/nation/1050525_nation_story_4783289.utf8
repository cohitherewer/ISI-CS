 Cops rapped in car rape let-off

 New Delhi (PTI): A city court has acquitted 

 three persons accused of abduction and gangrape of a woman 

 in a moving car in 1994. 

 The decade-long trial came to an end with the court indicting police for holding back crucial witnesses.

 Additional sessions judge Swaran Kanta, who also found the alleged victim an unreliable witness, released the three, saying the prosecution was not able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons had committed the charged offence. 

 The trio had allegedly abducted the woman from a juice shop on Asaf Ali Road on the night of November 11, 1994, and raped her in a car. 

 The court said: The woman kept changing 

 her statement about the date of the incident, lodging of 

 complaint, details of the arrest and glaring discrepancies 

 had emerged making her story doubtful and unworthy of credence. 

 The prosecution did not examine either the juice shop owner, who the woman claimed was a witness to her abduction, nor her four friends to whom she first narrated the incident. 

 It is well settled law that holding back available witnesses leads the court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution that if examined they would have deposed against the prosecution, the court said. 

 Thrash police pictures

 New Delhi (PTI): A senior police official 

 on Tuesday submitted to a Delhi court a sketch of one of 

 the three policemen, who allegedly tortured a minor boy 

 in custody.

 On May 13, the court had ordered a test identification parade based on sketches after the boy, who was shown photographs of all 86 officials posted at the Najafgarh police station, said the people who had beaten him up were not among them.

 Taking a serious view of the alleged non-cooperation, the court had told the official to use his sixth sense to find out the culprits.

 The matter is serious in nature. Allegations are against police. It is expedient in the interest of justice that the accused should be apprehended at the earliest, the had court.

 The boy, facing inquiry in a culpable homicide case, was taking food at a roadside hotel on April 18 when the three policemen came and questioned him about a theft. He was then taken into custody and thrashed.

 The way the child was beaten is horrifying. Considering the age of the child, the instrument used (iron pipe) for beating him and the injuries on his body, the child could have died, the court said. 

 RSS chief hurt in fall

 Bhubaneswar (PTI): RSS chief K.S. 

 Sudarshan slipped and fell in a bathroom at a training camp 

 of the outfit at Talcher on Monday. 

 Sudarshan, who was attending the two-day training camp, sprained his ankle and suffered a minor head injury on Monday, RSS sources said. 

 UAE work rule

 Dubai (PTI): The UAE government has 

 ruled that workers in all sectors are no longer required 

 to hold high school certificates. Earlier, private firms 

 were not allowed to recruit Asians without the certificate. 

 The criterion will, however, continue to apply for professionals 

 like doctors, engineers, pharmacists, whose jobs require 

 a minimum qualification.

 Sudan job blues

 Chennai (PTI): Twenty-nine persons, 

 who were taken to Sudan on the promise of better jobs, have 

 been rescued and brought back here. A Malaysian agency had 

 recruited the technicians in March. In Sudan, they faced 

 harsh service conditions, were not given appropriate food 

 and soon their employers had started evading salaries.

 Taj bomb inquiry

 Agra (PTI): An inquiry has been ordered 

 after an army bomb was found in Tajganj area near the Taj 

 Mahal. Police said the bomb, which was spotted by some local 

 youths on Monday evening, had probably reached there through 

 junk dealers.

 Prisoners flee

 Kannur (PTI): Two prisoners have 

 escaped from the Central Jail here on Tuesday. The two, 

 hailing from Tamil Nadu and serving terms in theft cases, 

 scaled the jails high walls with the help of an iron 

 pipe.

 Six pilgrims dead

 Hoshiarpur (PTI): Seven persons were 

 killed when a Tata Sumo collided with a minibus at Monaka 

 village on Tuesday. Among the dead were six passengers of 

 the Sumo who were returning from a pilgrimage to Vaishno 

 Devi in Jammu.

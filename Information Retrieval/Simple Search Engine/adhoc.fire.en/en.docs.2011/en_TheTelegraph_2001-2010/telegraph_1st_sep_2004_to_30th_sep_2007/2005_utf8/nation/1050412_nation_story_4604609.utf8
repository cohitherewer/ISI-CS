The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Beijing beckons Bollywood

 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, April 11: The rolling greens of Switzerland may soon give way to Chinese locales on the silver screen if the protocol on the India-China Film Cooperation Commission signed today takes off well. 

 The protocol, the first of its kind to be signed with China, envisages a comprehensive agreement on entertainment. It will allow both countries to open their film facilities, including studios and locations for each other. 

 The pact is an indication of how well political relations between the nations have progressed since the 1962 war. 

 ?Today, there is a new confidence in relations which has led to both countries engaging at various levels, including tapping the entertainment industry,? a senior official said. ?The protocol will open the doors to widespread cooperation by the film industries of the two countries.? 

 If nothing else, it will help film producers exploit the exotic locations of a country so far unexplored by Bollywood. 

 Officials feel on-location shooting will take off with a bang, though other aspects may take longer to develop as Mumbai has little knowledge of China?s film industry. 

 All are not impressed, though. ?As an independent filmmaker, I am not jumping with joy at the thought of shooting in China. In a tightly-controlled political system, there is little room for anyone to make a meaningful, serious film,? said Sanjay Kak, a documentary filmmaker. ?At a technical level, it could yield fruit,? he said. 

 He also agreed that for Bollywood it could yield rich dividends especially as the Chinese are believed to enjoy Hindi masala movies. 

 The film commission will meet every six months alternately in Beijing and New Delhi to work out the nitty gritties between the film industries. 

 To familiarise the audience with each other?s films, festivals will be held and, if they succeed, they will become annual features. 

 The commission will consider increasing the import of each other?s films and exchange of technical knowhow on filmmaking. Import of Indian films is being seen by government officials as a positive signal from China as the country has restrictions on the number of foreign films imported.

 Apart from helping film crews hunt for locations, the two sides will also facilitate the marketing and distribution of films in each other?s country. At a later stage, there may be joint productions too. 

 Animation films are popular in China and the country has a developed expertise in making animation spots.

 ?The commission has also been asked to explore avenues for bilateral cooperation in developing animation and facilitating their diffusion,? a statement issued after signing the protocol said.

 Outsider fire at Thackeray 

 Mumbai: When Narayan Rane criticised 

 Uddhav Thackeray, the Shiv Sena expelled him. When Raj Thackeray 

 attacked Uddhav, Bal Thackeray listened.

 This was the nub of Congressman Ranes complaint on Saturday as he tore into Bal Thackeray in public for the first time since leaving the Sena, reports our special correspondent.

 The former chief minister referred to the way the Sena supremo brought about a reconciliation between nephew Raj and son Uddhav a few days ago. When I spoke about the way the party was being run (by Uddhav), I was shown the door because I am an outsider. But when Raj Thackeray raised the same questions, Bal Thackeray called him and heard his grievances because he is a family member.

 Rane, who had told the Congress leadership that hundreds of disgruntled Shiv Sainiks would follow him into his new party, is busy proving his worth. His two sons joined the Congress last month with 22 former Sena office-bearers. Rane has also got Sena labour leader Jaywant Parab and an estimated 5,000 Sainiks to switch loyalties.

 Paswan copter

 Hajipur(PTI): Union minister Ram Vilas 

 Paswan had a narrow escape on Saturday when the towel of 

 an onlooker got entangled with the rotors of his helicopter, 

 seconds after lift-off from a field in his constituency, 

 Hajipur.

 The pilot saw the towel and immediately switched off the engine and asked Paswan to get off.

 Death row Indian

 New Delhi: The Prime Minister should 

 try and save the life of an Indian sentenced to death in 

 Pakistan on spying charges, employees of the Research and 

 Analysis Wing, have said. The general secretary of the Cabinet 

 Secretariat (RAW) Employees Association has asked Manmohan 

 Singh to intervene on behalf of Manjit Singh.

 Tsunami scare

 Chennai (PTI): Fearing that another tsunami 

 had struck, hundreds of fisherfolk in some northern suburbs 

 of the city and in Cuddalore district ran for shelter on 

 Friday night and Saturday when sea water entered their houses. 

 They were later told it was only the high tides and not 

 a tsunami. 

 The army has opened a limb repair centre in 

 Poonch, Jammu and Kashmir. It has been conceived as a tribute 

 to the people there, who carry on with their lives in the 

 face of firing along the LoC.

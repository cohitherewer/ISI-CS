 Venkaiah back, a post lower

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Naidu: By Advani?s side

 New Delhi, April 7: The former BJP president is back as a vice-president, six months after he stepped down citing his wife?s ?ill-health?.

 M. Venkaiah Naidu?s appointment, one scale lower in the hierarchy, was formally announced today. He had quit in October 2004.

 ?The party president (L.K. Advani) had requested Naidu to take up the post despite the latter?s stand that he will work without a post. On Advani?s persuasion, Naidu accepted the post,? said Arun Jaitley, the BJP?s general secretary and spokesman.

 Naidu may be given ?important? tasks during the reallocation of party responsibilities to be decided by the end of this week, sources said.

 An office-bearer close to the leader said he would function as Advani?s ?closest assistant? and handle the nuts and bolts of organisational chores. This would leave the BJP chief more time for parliamentary work and his responsibilities as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.

 The other reason underlying Naidu?s induction, sources claimed, was that the party chief would have to focus on positioning himself and the BJP for a targeted victory in a likely mid-term poll ? the party?s perception is that the ruling UPA is ?disintegrating?, post- Bihar and Jharkhand.

 The BJP today virtually confirmed the retirement of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who had yesterday signalled as much to his party. Jaitley said: ?The party always has the highest regard for what Vajpayee says. We will always need his guidance and we continue to look up to him.?

 Jaitley denied that Naidu?s appointment was a demotion although the former BJP chief is now one of five vice-presidents, who include his own protege Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Kalyan Singh, Babulal Marandi and Sushil Modi.

 Naidu, however, had told his friends in private that he was to be ?depromoted?.

 Notwithstanding his dramatic exit from the top post after the BJP lost the Maharashtra polls, Naidu had kept himself in the party mainstream.

 Picking up phrases from Sonia Gandhi?s ?sacrifice? speech, he had said how his ?inner voice? told him to leave the post and deliver the party into Advani?s ?safe hands?.

 But he continued to be mostly in Delhi and seldom in Chennai, where he was supposed to spend time with his ailing wife. Recently, he was tasked by Advani to cobble together a government in Jharkhand and tackle the Gujarat dissidents.

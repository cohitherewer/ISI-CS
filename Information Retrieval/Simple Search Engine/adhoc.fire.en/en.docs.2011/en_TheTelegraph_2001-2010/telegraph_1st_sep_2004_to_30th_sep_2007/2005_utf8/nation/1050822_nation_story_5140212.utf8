 US-type terror tracker on govt table

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Circa 2010. A terrorist group is planning a strike in some part of India, with the security agencies having little information about it.

 But a nerve centre, connected to a huge network of computers in every corner of the country, comes to the rescue. 

 Processing billions of information bytes ? relating to bank and credit card transactions, travel, phone calls and the like ? per second, it notices something suspicious. It sends a warning to district, state and central security and law-enforcing agencies, suggesting who could be planning a sabotage and where.

 The security forces move swiftly and catch the terrorists before they can do any harm.

 According to Union home ministry sources, such an internal security centre could come up sooner than later. The ministry is examining a proposal sent by IIT Kanpur in June this year.

 The proposal has been sent to IB (Intelligence Bureau) and RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) for comments. If they clear it, the ministry will start working on its implementation, a source said.

 The proposal is broadly based on the Homeland Security System in the US, which has made enormous progress in the field of internal security after the 9/11 terror attacks.

 The nerve centre, once set up, will dramatically increase the co-ordination between security and law-enforcing agencies as well as private companies (such as banks and mobile service providers) at every level: central, state, district and local. For 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, it will track all Indians, checking their movement and transactions, matching their fingerprints.

 The idea is to keep a tab on all movements of every sort of subversive element and pre-empt all kinds of sabotage activities and minimise collateral damage to the country, said Professor Phalguni Gupta of the computer science and engineering department, IIT Kanpur, one of the brains behind the idea.

 As the database and computer network will forever be expanding, the nerve centre will have to be upgraded all the time.

 IIT Kanpur is capable of handling such a system; it already has the expertise, Prof. Gupta said. We have a biometry system and are doing a big project for the ministry of communications and information technology, which requires a kind of expertise that can be used to set up an internal security centre. If the proposal comes through, our role will be to provide advice and R amp;D facility.

 The cost of setting up the nerve centre, or of running it, hasnt been worked out yet.

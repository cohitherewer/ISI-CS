 Amethi, Dec. 4: Despite her 80-odd years, the journey from Delhi and the unfamiliar surroundings, she showed no signs of fatigue or boredom. She looked around with curiosity, asking questions about a group of suffering people whose lifestyle was a far cry from hers and whose language she didnt understand.

 The Nehru-Gandhi family was out in strength here today, but it was their overseas guest Paola Maino who stole the show. 

 Rahul Gandhis nani from Orbassano, Italy, moved around the eye hospital named after the young MPs dadi, greeting the patients with a namaste ? one of the few words she had picked up during her handful of visits to India.

 The Indira Gandhi Eye Hospital and Research Centre was inaugurated today by Sonia Gandhi as her mother, son, daughter Priyanka and son-in-law Robert Vadra looked on.

 Maino wasnt satisfied just watching, though. She asked a doctor how long it would take to cure a certain patient of blindness. As the doctor replied seven days, the elderly woman nodded and moved on to another bed.

 The Congress and the hospital had kept Mainos visit a secret unlike that of the Nehru-Gandhis. After an hour, she retreated to a local guesthouse as Sonia and Rahul addressed party workers at a nearby park.

 The hospital will function with the help of the premier Aravind Eye Care Centre of Madurai.

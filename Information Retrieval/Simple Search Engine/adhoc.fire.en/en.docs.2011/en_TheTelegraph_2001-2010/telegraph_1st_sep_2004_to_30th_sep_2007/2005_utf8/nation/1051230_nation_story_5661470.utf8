 Words wither, paper cool 

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Mumbai, Dec. 29: The BJP has breathed fire from the pulpit at in-house corruption but stopped short of reflecting the indignation on paper.

 Seeking to compensate for L.K. Advanis tepid references to corrupt MPs at the partys national convention yesterday, Sushma Swaraj today mounted a no-holds-barred attack on dishonesty in public life.

 However, her party did not take a clear stand. Although the BJPs political resolution rued the involvement of party MPs in the cash-for-questions scandal, it hit out at the governments short-circuiting of the disciplinary procedure.

 The political resolution today was a vast improvement over Advanis comments on MPs caught in the scam yesterday, when he concentrated his firepower on corruption in the Congress. But the resolution did not contradict his much-criticised stupidity statement on the issue in Parliament. The party ended up adopting a somewhat lukewarm line compared to the one Sushma took from the dais.

 The stonewalling of the UPA on the Volcker report and the Mitrokhin revelations can be contrasted with the alacrity of the Congress to act in the cash-for-questions scandal involving 11 MPs. The BJP unreservedly expresses its regret over the involvement of some of its elected representatives. Such people have no place in parliamentary democracy, the resolution said.

 The party maintained that its decision to boycott Parliament on a motion to adopt a resolution demanding immediate expulsion of the MPs was correct. The party is concerned about short-circuiting disciplinary procedure that could open the floodgates of political vendetta, the resolution said.

 However, Sushma played to the gallery, connecting with over 3,500 delegates who have been feeling let down by Advanis response to the web of sleaze and scandal the party has been recently caught in.

 We saw a play yesterday on the life of Shivaji who brought gold back from his conquests. His soldiers refused to accept the gold from him. They told him they didnt want it. We want such foot-soldiers in our party. We want men and women of invincible, incorruptible character. There is no place in our party for men who can be bought for money, Sushma said.

 Another leader in no mood to mince his words was Kalyan Singh. In a veiled attack on the BJP president-elect, Rajnath Singh, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister referred to criminalisation of politics, giving a hint of the kind of resistance awaiting Rajnath, who is known to support many a muscleman. 

 Rajnath had issued a strong statement against Mayavati for having controversial MP Raja Bhaiyya arrested under a lapsed law.

 When we are asking people to raise their hands against criminal politicians during the nyay yatra (which was organised by Rajnath) in Uttar Pradesh, what prevents us from doing the same here? Why dont we clean our act? Why dont we raise our hands and announce from this platform that we will never support criminals who are politicians, Singh said.

 Singh also appealed to the party not to shy away from Hindutva ideology.

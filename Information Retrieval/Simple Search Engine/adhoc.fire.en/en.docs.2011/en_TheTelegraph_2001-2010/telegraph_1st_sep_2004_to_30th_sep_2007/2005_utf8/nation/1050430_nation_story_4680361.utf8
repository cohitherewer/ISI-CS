 Surjeet in hospital

 New Delhi, April 29: Harkishen Singh Surjeet has been hospitalised in Bangkok due to sudden ill health. 

 The 87-year-old communist leader, who quit the CPM general secretary?s post this month, was on his way to Vietnam to attend a programme commemorating 30 years of liberation of Saigon from US occupation. 

 ?He fell ill on the flight because of dehydration caused by diarrhoea. He is in the ICU but his condition is stable,? said party MP Nilotpal Basu. Surjeet?s grandson was travelling with him. 

 The CPM has asked Basu to reach Bangkok tomorrow. ?We will see his condition and then decide whether he can go to Vietnam or should get back to Delhi,? said the MP.

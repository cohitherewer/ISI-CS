The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Wanted, BJP chief with parivar bond

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh does not have too many conditions for L.K. Advanis successor. But the person must be committed to its ideology and, more important, emotionally bond with the parivars entire cadre, not with just those of the BJP.

 We want the ideological commitment of the RSS to be reflected in the BJPs organisation, said a well-placed Sangh source. This does not mean we want them to replicate everything we say or do. They (the BJP) are in politics and politics demands pragmatism and compromises in an era of coalitions.

 The source stressed that to restore the relations between the two entities, the next BJP president must emotionally bond with the cadre. The BJP and RSS cadre grow up in the same shakhas (branches) before going their separate ways. This is the bonding that ensures that they work selflessly for one another, that the Sangh cadre campaign tirelessly in their own way and do the booth management in an election for the BJP without expecting any returns, the source explained.

 The view in the parivar is that the Advani-RSS spat has confused and demoralised the cadre, who have not taken too kindly to the BJP chiefs swipes at the Sangh at the partys recent national executive in Chennai. The BJP leaders understand their sentiments very well. This is why barring Jaswant Singh, none of the others has backed Advani publicly, the source said.

 But it was emphasised that while the RSS had indicated its mind on Advanis successor in a series of meetings Sangh and BJP leaders held in July and August, it would not intervene any more. At least, it would not like to seen as intervening because any suggestion of this would be seen as a vindication of Advanis statement in Chennai that the RSS was trying to deny the BJP its functional autonomy.

 Reports have appeared that the RSS has two or three favourites, the source said. None of this is true. We do not want to go into the business of names and speculations. All that we know is that the BJP stands at a critical juncture and its destiny will be shaped by who takes over as the president in December.

 The Sangh has its own ideas on how to revive the emotional bonding with the BJP. One of them is to restart the practice of initiating the non-RSS BJP members ? that is, those who come from other parties or join the BJP via a non-RSS route ? into the Hindutva stream through short-term training courses to expose them to the ideology. This practice apparently petered out when the National Democratic Alliance was in power and ideology given a wide berth.

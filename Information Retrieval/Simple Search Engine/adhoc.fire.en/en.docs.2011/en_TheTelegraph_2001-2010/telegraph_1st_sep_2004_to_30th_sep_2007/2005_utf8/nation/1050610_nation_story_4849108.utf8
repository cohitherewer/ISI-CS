 Delhi student torment 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 9: A Delhi University student from the Northeast has fallen prey to sexual predators in Delhi, a month after a Mizo student was abducted and gangraped in the capital.

 The girl, hailing from Sikkim and studying in Jesus and Mary College (JMC), was allegedly raped on Sunday in the Chanakyapuri area, a few kilometres from Dhaula Kuan where the 20-year-old Mizo student was assaulted on May 8.

 Three suspects have been arrested. Police said it was not a rape, but a case of molestation.

 It is not a case of rape, it is a case of molestation. We are investigating the case and the girl is with us on this, Anita Roy, deputy commissioner of police, said.

 The second-year undergraduate student from Sikkim is a JMC hosteller. But on the day of the incident, she had gone to stay with her cousin, a policeman, near the college. The cousin belongs to Sikkim police but he is posted in Delhi on deputation.

 JMC is one of the top colleges for women in the capital. Priyanka Gandhi is among the alumni of the college.

 According to an FIR filed at Tilak Marg police station just after midnight on Monday, the incident occurred around 9 pm on Sunday when the girl had gone to the neighbouring Nangla Machi basti to see a doctor for medicines.

 After taking the medicines, the girl went to a pay-and-use toilet. After she left the toilet, she realised that three youths were following her.

 One of them put a knife to her neck and they dragged her to the nearby ridge, where she was beaten and raped by one of them as the others stood guard, according to the FIR.

 The girl later went to her cousin who took her to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. 

 The police were informed and the FIR was registered under sections dealing with rape and attempt to murder.

 The three accused, Shiv Kumar Jha, Shyam Jha and S. Kumar, were arrested and sent to judicial custody on Tuesday.

 We own responsibility: Geologists

 A shot from a navy helicopter shows the havoc wreaked by the December 26 tsunami on vegetation near the Indira Point lighthouse on the Great Nicobar island.

 Two months after the disaster, India?s geologists have owned moral responsibility for the devastation. 

 B.P. Radhakrishna, the president of the Geological Survey of India, wrote in the institute?s journal that the geologists in the country failed to give a warning though they were ?fully aware of the fact that an earthquake of magnitude 9 ? an extremely rare event ? had occurred in an oceanic subduction zone in the proximity of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands?. 

 ?In the final analysis, the geological community as a whole must own responsibility for not warning the people in the coastal belt in advance.?

 He added: ?This should lead to introspection and reflection on the part of all of us so that our science can play a more responsible societal role in the future.? (AFP picture)

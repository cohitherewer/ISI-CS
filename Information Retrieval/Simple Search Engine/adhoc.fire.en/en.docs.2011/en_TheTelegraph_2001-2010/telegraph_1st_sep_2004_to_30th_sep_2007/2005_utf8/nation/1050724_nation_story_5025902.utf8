 Pandits split on return 

 BINOO JOSHI

 Jammu, July 23: The militant ban on the return of Pandits to the Kashmir valley has shaken the community. It is now blaming those of its leaders who had discussed a possible return with the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, accusing them of having thoughtlessly invited trouble.

 On July 19, some representatives of the community had met moderate Hurriyat leaders and received their approval for Pandits coming back to the Valley, which they had left in droves following the outbreak of militancy over a decade and a half ago.

 But yesterday, a statement issued by the militant outfits Farzandan-e-Milat, Save Kashmir Movement, Al-Arifeen and Al-Nasreen said: Unless they (Pandits) apologise for being the tools for Indias murderous designs on Kashmiri Muslims and join the freedom struggle, they will not be allowed to return.

 The four groups had made headlines earlier this year when they banned travel on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus and later owned responsibility for the April 6 attack on Srinagars Tourist Reception Centre, where the passengers were put up for the night before the first bus left for Muzaffarabad on April 7.

 Today, some Pandits were shouting in anger against leaders who had spoken to the Hurriyat. 

 What business did they have putting the lives of the whole community at such a grave risk? said Pardhuman Kishen, a migrant who owns a house and orchards outside the Valley, at Asnoor village in south Kashmir.

 Kishen, who has done well for himself after leaving the Valley, has no plans to return for good. 

 But he is afraid that the militants might now target Pandits outside the Valley, too. He is also worried about the property he owns in the Valley, which he still visits occasionally.

 Militants are capable of doing anything; they can strike anywhere. So far, my property was safe and I was able to visit the Valley during summers. What will happen now? Who will save my unprotected property?

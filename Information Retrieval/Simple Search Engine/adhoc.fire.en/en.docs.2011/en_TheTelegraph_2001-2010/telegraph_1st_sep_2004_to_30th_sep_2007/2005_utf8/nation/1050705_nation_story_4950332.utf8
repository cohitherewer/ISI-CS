 Bitter pill on China degree

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, July 4: The Medical Council of India, which decides if a doctor can practice in the country, has refused to warn Indian students studying medicine in China that their degrees would not be recognised here. 

 The MCI will not warn any students about deciding where they should study. That is not our business. If the students make ill-informed decisions, what can we do about it? asked Dr P. Kumar, the additional secretary of the medical council.

 There is a growing rush of Indian students to Chinese medical institutes as tuition fees are lower there. Hundreds flock to the Tian Jin Medical University in Tian Jin, the Three Gorges University in Hubei province, the Xingxian University in Henan province and other institutions in Nanjing and Suzhou cities.

 But the decision of the apex regulatory body for medical practitioners may leave aspiring doctors studying in China in the lurch after they return home. We are not responsible for the problems students face when they come back, said a senior official of the medical council.

 Indian diplomats, however, have warned the students that degrees awarded to them there will not get recognition back home. Embassy officials also said there are growing complaints of poor facilities in the Chinese medical colleges.

 We have received complaints from Indian students regarding non-availability of properly qualified English-speaking teaching faculty in some of the Chinese medical colleges, though at the time of admission they were assured about it, an embassy official, who recently visited two Chinese medical colleges, said.

 We will not let such a thing happen, Nalin Surie, the Indian ambassador in Beijing said, referring to the problems faced by Indian students in China. He said the embassy would ensure that the students receive proper education in the medical colleges there and are treated well. 

 Surie said the embassy had long ago written to departments concerned back home about the difficulties students are likely to face. The medical councils assistance has been sought in the matter.

 The council ensures that Indian students wanting to study abroad possess the required qualifications. It also screens students who, after their course abroad, seek internship or a professional career in India. 

 However, several students, not warned about the shortcomings in the curriculum in Chinese colleges, find the medical body failing them when they come back.

 We recognise colleges that are recognised in that country, said Dr Kumar, but admitted that several students who failed the screening were from recognised Chinese colleges. 

 Many of the colleges the students go to in China are among the best in that country, Kumar said, though the curriculum does not match with that in India. The Tian Jin Medical University, where hundreds of Indian students go each year, is the first higher medical educational institution to be recognised in China.

 The Indian embassy has asked all students from here to register either with the embassy or with the consulate in Shanghai so that officials can assist students if they faced problems. 

 Most of the students come from the northeastern states.

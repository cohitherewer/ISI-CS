The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Not in the contest, but a favourite

 TILAK D. GUPTA

 At Khagaria, many tell us it is a direct contest between Ranvir Yadav and Gita Yadav. Others say Ranvirs main challenger might be Satyadeo Singh of the Lok Janshakti Party. But we cannot locate Ranvirs name on the list of candidates available with us. 

 The riddle is solved by elderly Srikrishna Singh from the village of Rahimpur Dhala. Ranvir is an absconder and has been expelled from the district by the administration. His wife Poonam Devi is the proxy candidate on a JD-U ticket, he clarifies, for our benefit. 

 Last February, Poonam won on the LJP symbol but later defected to the Janata Dal (United). People close to Ranvir, the crimelord of the riverine land along the Ganga, offer to arrange a meeting with him if we can wait for a day. 

 We cannot. 

 In the adjacent Chautham constituency of the same district, Sunita Sharma, also an LJP winner the last time, is back in the fray. She has, however, remained loyal to Ram Vilas Paswan. 

 In Khagaria town, Chandramukhi Devi, who fought in February as the BJP candidate, is now back as an Independent to spoil Poonams chance in the hustings. If Poonam wins, the seat that actually belonged to the BJP would permanently go away to the Dal (U) quota. 

 A section of the saffron party, therefore, is covertly championing Chandramukhis candidature. Most women here are surrogate nominees, says Binda Mahato, the mukhiya of the Goura-Shakti panchayat. He rattles off names of other women who are fighting as proxies for their criminal husbands in different corners of the Kosi region.

 Criss-crossed by many rivulets leading to the Kosi or the Ganga, Khagaria and the rest of the region are highly flood-prone. 

 Moreover, the major rivers continue to change course and while old land goes under water new land crops up, explains Valmiki Mondal, a local schoolteacher. Riparian land rights belong only to the mighty crimelords like Ranvir or his musclemen, interjects Srikrishna Singh. 

 Once, these criminals used to capture polling booths for their politician masters. Later, they found it more profitable to become political masters themselves, says Valmiki.

 One tends to be a little surprised by the social sanction enjoyed by these gangster-turned-politicians. Srikrishna is a supporter of Gita Yadav, the CPM contestant. 

 His teenaged sons, Ravi and Sumit, however, are ardent Ranvir fans. We ask the boys about Ranvirs credentials and both duly affirm that he is an apradhi. But only outlaws like him can rob the rich to help the poor and force a corrupt and indolent administration to some activity, they insist.

 Others in the village of Mesauri, adjacent to Khagaria town, also confirm popular support for Ranvir and his ilk. Social sanction enjoyed by these dons does not augur well for the future of our democracy, says an old Gandhi-capped Congressman, Basdeo Shah at Khagaria. 

 While criminals rule the roost in Khagaria and its neighbouring regions, small farmers seem to be fighting a losing battle to hold on to their small plots. We will not push the button this time as no party cares for us, shouts a visibly agitated Satyanand Kashyap at Mesauri. 

 Do you know how many maunds of maize need to be produced to buy a packet of quality seeds? he asks. His friends, while trying to pacify him, explain that the price of seeds has increased so much that one quintal of maize requires to be sold to get a five-kg pack of seeds. The small Koiree farmers of Mesauri, despite their anger, would eventually vote Dal (U), we come to understand.

 We have tried to diversify by planting sunflower, mint and bananas but need state support, asserts Sunil Kumar, an enlightened farmer owning four acres in Goura village. 

 Asked about his voting preference, he merely terms Lalooji as a man without any vision. We want a change, he says. 

 While poor peasants are suffering, relatively big farmers seem to be doing pretty well. Ayodhya Singh in village Rahimpur owns a tractor and a boring well for irrigation. Apart from producing two crops in his eight acre farm, he earns considerably more by hering out his tractor and selling water raised from his bore well. Ayodhyas vote would also go the JD-U way because he considers Nitish Kumar as a man of action. The bridge across the Ganga at Bihpur, a little further east from Khagaria, was built because of Nitishjis initiative, he argues. 

 Laloo Prasad is backing the CPI(M) candidate Geeta Yadav and a patient crowd is braving rain to wait for his helicopter to arrive. Finally his poll meeting is cancelled due to inclement weather. And that is a sure setback for the CPI(M) nominee backed by the Secular Demicratic Front. Khagaria district is also Ramvilas Paswans homeground and his brother is expected to win easily from the Alouli seat. Paswans LJP, in fact, won three of the four seats in Khagaria during February polls but the wind now is blowing more in favour of JD-U, inform usually reliable observers of the local political scenario.

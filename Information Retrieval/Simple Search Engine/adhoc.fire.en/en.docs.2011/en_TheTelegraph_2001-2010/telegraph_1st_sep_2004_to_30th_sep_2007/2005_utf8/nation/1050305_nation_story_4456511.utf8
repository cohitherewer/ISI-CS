 Jaya slur on PC raises House storm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, March 4: The ruling ADMK today questioned Union finance minister P. Chidambaram?s integrity over the release of central funds for tsunami relief in Tamil Nadu, sparking an uproar in the Assembly.

 The Jayalalithaa government, which presented a tax-free budget on Monday in which it shelved the introduction of value-added tax in a pre-election year, found itself locking horns with the United Progressive Alliance. 

 Leaders from the Congress, the DMK and the PMK walked out of the Assembly when the ADMK charged Chidambaram with ?lack of honesty?.

 State finance minister C. Ponnaiyan had said in his budget speech that the Centre had sanctioned Rs 1,726.72 crore for tsunami relief in the state, but has released only an advance of Rs 250 crore so far. He wanted the government to ensure that the money is given immediately from the National Calamity Contingency Fund.

 As the general debate on the budget began in the Assembly today, ADMK leader Kumaradoss described Chidambaram as ?nanayam attravar (one lacking in integrity)?. However, he was quick to add that this was not a personal slur but a reference to him ?as Union finance minister?.

 Congress members, led by S.R. Balasubramoniyan, began protesting vociferously. Condemning such an allegation against a person ?not present in the House?, Balasubramoniyan urged Speaker K. Kalimuthu to expunge the ?unparliamentary? words.

 However, Jayalalithaa did not find anything objectionable in Kumaradoss? comment. ?I wish to reiterate that we are not discussing the personal character of the Union finance minister,? she said.

 As the Congress leaders chorused in protest, Jayalalithaa intervened to ask: ?What point is there in fighting over words when they (Chidambaram and other Union ministers from Tamil Nadu), having won on the votes polled by the people of Tamil Nadu, were so ineffective in getting the sanctioned funds released for the tsunami victims in the state?? 

 She alleged that the ministers were ?ineffectual? and had no resourcefulness in getting the money released, triggering another round of complaints.

 When the Speaker declined to expunge the words, Congress leaders walked out, followed by DMK legislators led by the party?s deputy chief Durai Murugan and the PMK members led by G.K. Mani.

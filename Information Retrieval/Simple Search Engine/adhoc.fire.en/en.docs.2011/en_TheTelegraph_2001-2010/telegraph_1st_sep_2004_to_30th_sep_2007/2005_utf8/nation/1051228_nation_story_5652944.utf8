 Amar Singh: Reel to real

 Lucknow, Dec. 27: Amar Singh is one of Amitabh Bachchans biggest fans, but he probably hadnt bargained for a Deewar being played out in his own life.

 The Samajwadi Party leaders estranged brother Arvind Singh today joined the Congress, giving it a handle to embarrass Amar and adding the latest episode to the serial family frictions making news recently.

 Amar would not have trouble finding sympathy or advice. At least two of the countrys most well-known sibling schisms involve Amars close friends: Bachchan, who has for years had an uneasy relationship with Ajitabh, and Anil Ambani, who fell out with Mukesh.

 The break-up of the Singh brothers ? Arvind is younger by a year and a half ? had a whiff of the Ambanis about it. The duo, who jointly owned a chemical plant in Ghaziabad, fell out over its ownership.

 Amar Singh threw me out, the taller and thinner Arvind told reporters.

 Arvind had then been in the Samajwadi Party ? which he today dubbed casteist. He had joined the party before the May 2004 polls and campaigned in the Azamgarh area.

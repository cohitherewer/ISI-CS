 Power to panchayats

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 17: The Orissa government will introduce a bill in the next session of the Assembly for further devolution of power to panchayati raj institutions in the state.

 A recent meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik discussed several issues related to the institutions, including transfer of funds, functions and functionaries.

 The departments of health and family welfare, women and child development, animal husbandry and fishing, school and mass education and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe development have agreed to the draft proposal prepared by a committed under the chairmanship of chief secretary Subash Pani on the devolution of powers.

 On the other hand, the agriculture, rural development and food and consumer welfare departments were yet to agree on all points and have called for further discussions.

 Patnaik is expected to discuss the details of the devolution of power with the heads of the three departments soon.

 Functions like healthcare and family welfare (health department) maternity benefit, institutional delivery and childcare will be transferred to the panchayati raj institutions. The SC/ST development minister has agreed to transfer functions like eradication of untouchability, atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and tribal education. 

 Elementary education, transfer and posting of elementary teachers and disbursement of salaries (school and mass education department) will also be transferred.

 The agriculture department will stand to lose a number of key functions once the devolution of powers takes place. Kharif and rabi programmes, soil conservation, horticulture and watershed projects will be transferred. The transfer of village and agricultural workers is the bone of contention between the two departments.

 On the other hand, transfer of the Swajaldhara scheme has been opposed by rural development minister Biswabhusan Harichandan. He has, however, agreed to hand over drinking water and sanitation programmes and employees.

 Lucknow, Oct. 15: Riots at three places that claimed seven lives since yesterday have pushed the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh into a political storm.

 Mau town, 250 km from here, witnessed the worst violence, with five persons killed and 16 injured as two communities fought each other, prompting a curfew and shoot-at-sight orders today.

 In Pratapgarh, at least 20 homes ? all belonging to people from a single community ? were torched last night in retaliation for the murder of Promod Mishra, a man related to a panchayat leader. In Ghosi, it was a panchayat leaders murder that drew two communities into battle this morning.

 The district administration pushed three companies of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) and four of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) into Mau as, after a lull last night, violence again flared this morning, killing two persons. 

 Houses were set on fire, shops were ransacked and mobs attacked the police.

 The Opposition quickly blamed the state government for the situation in Mau, with the BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) accusing local Samajwadi Party MLA Mukhtar Ansari of stoking the fire. The Congress, too, attacked the government.

 We demand the dismissal of the state government, which was responsible for the trouble in the town, said former chief minister Kalyan Singh.

 The first hint of trouble in Mau came on Thursday when two groups quarrelled over the use of loudspeakers during a Bharat Milap procession, organised as part of the Dussehra festivities.

 On Friday morning, the procession was taken out despite the protests, leading to a bout of firing from both sides that killed one person. 

 As news of the death spread, rival mobs ran wild on the streets, ransacking shops in busy marketplaces and attacking each other. Ansari is accused of leading one of the mobs. 

 Two more died in the clashes.

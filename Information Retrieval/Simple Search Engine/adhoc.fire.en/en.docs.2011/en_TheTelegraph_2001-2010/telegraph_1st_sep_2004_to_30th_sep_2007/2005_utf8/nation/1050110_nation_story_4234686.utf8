 Former minister shot dead in robbery

 Chennai, Jan. 9 (PTI): 

 A six-member gang today shot dead former Tamil Nadu minister 

 and sitting MLA K. Sudarsanam at his residence in suburban 

 Tiruvallur and decamped with an unspecified amount of cash 

 and jewellery, police said.

 The assailants injured a son of the MLA. The 57-year-old Sudarsanam, who represented Gumidipoondi, is survived by his wife and two sons.

 According to police, on hearing his son Satish shouting for help from an adjoining room, the MLA rushed to his rescue with a sharp-edged weapon and was shot dead by the gangsters. The incident occurred around 2.30 am.

 Sudarsanam was cremated this evening.

 The police have formed special teams to trace the gang following chief minister Jayalalithaa?s order to take all steps to catch the culprits at the earliest.

 In a condolence message to the bereaved family members, Jayalalithaa recalled Sudarsanam?s contribution to the ADMK and his constituency.

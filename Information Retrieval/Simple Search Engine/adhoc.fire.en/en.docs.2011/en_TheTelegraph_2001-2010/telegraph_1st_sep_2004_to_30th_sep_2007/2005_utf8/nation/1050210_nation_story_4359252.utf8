 Common enemy for Haryana hopefuls

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: Rivals for the throne but ranged against a common enemy ? for the Haryana Congress, it is all in the party.

 Over the past few days, top contenders Chaudhary Birender Singh, Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Randeep Singh Surjewala have been meeting senior leaders in the capital to garner support.

 For Singh and Hooda in particular, the results of the February 3 polls are a foregone conclusion. ?The Congress will certainly win at least 65 seats (in the 90-member Assembly). The counting of votes on February 27 will only confirm it,? Singh said.

 But the two contenders as well as lesser aspirants like Union ministers Kumari Selja and Rao Inderjit Singh and industrialist Om Prakash Jindal are all understood to be united when it comes to opposing Bhajan Lal.

 The state Congress is broadly divided into two camps ? one loyal to Lal and the other opposed to him. His rivals concede that Lal, who is the state Congress chief, commands the support of more than a third of the party?s 90 candidates.

 If that gives the former chief minister an edge, all his rivals are ?united in their bid to prevent a fourth term? for him. They also reckon that party chief Sonia Gandhi could be disinclined to make him chief minister again because of his ?indifferent health?.

 One contender, however, said: ?Our weakness is that while we are together in opposing Bhajan Lal, we are divided sharply when it comes to our candidate for the chief minister?s job.? There are fears that Lal could exploit this weakness to clinch another term.

 Lal?s rivals believe the only way to pre-empt this is by convincing Sonia against giving him another term and allowing her to choose the candidate from among the rest.

 Aware that Lal has powerful backers in Sonia?s AICC team who, they believe, had helped him secure nominations for his loyalists, Lal?s rivals are lobbying a section of central leaders who do not see eye to eye with Lal?s backers.

 Singh, who has projected himself as an ?original-Rajiv (Gandhi) loyalist?, has, among others, met AICC general secretary Ambika Soni and former general secretary Salman Khursheed.

 Former Youth Congress chief Surjewala, who has taken on chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, is also mobilising support by projecting himself as the ?new generation Haryana leader?. Not identified with either the Lal or anti-Lal camp, he fancies his chances as a compromise candidate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Boycotted, by parties

 - Prices zooming, work is scarce and there is no power; but no one cares

 October and November are not the best months to hold elections in a predominantly agrarian society like that of Bihar. There is no work in the field till harvesting of paddy starts in the last week of December. 

 The food stocks in most poor rural households are almost exhausted. Many in our hamlet are now in Pune, Haryana and Punjab to eke out a living, says Surender Paswan at Mustafapur village in Patna district. 

 The local Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and a member of the Lok Sabha, Ganesh Prasad Yadav, complains that polls in this part of the year have deprived his party of the migrant votes. The rural poor, he argues, are our natural voters in all places except some pockets of Left influence.

 The conversation at the Dalit tola of the village hovers around the rising price of kerosene and lack of work opportunities during the lean season. Jogi Paswan says he gets 4 kg of grain as wage for a 10-hour working day in the field. The state has fixed minimum wage at Rs 58.50 but none gets it. 

 What is more problematic for them is the unavailability of agricultural work for more than two-three months a year. 

 In the state capital, a steep rise in onion price can become an election issue. Our query in this regard is met with silence. No one is sure about the prevailing price simply because they cannot afford to buy it. That kerosene for lighting lamps has to be bought at the black market at Rs 30 a litre, is everybodys grouse. Mustafapur is merely 35 km away from Patna, but electricity has eluded the village even after 58 years of Independence. 

 Bihar is indeed a benighted state and quite literally so. The men of Dalit tola, however, somehow fail to relate the issues of food and livelihood to the ongoing elections. Yes, they have voted RJD in the past but currently stand behind Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). 

 Earlier, the affluent Bhumihar landowners did not allow them to cast their ballot, recalls America Paswan, the sole government employee in the assembled lot. But now they exercise their right to franchise, he adds. 

 It seems that the OBC rule has facilitated in many places the Dalits right to vote. And now they wish to assert that right to build an independent Dalit political constituency.

 Paswan and his LJP at present seem to be the only option for a sizeable section of Dalits, particularly the Paswans, who are a part of the militant Dusadh community. 

 Mayavatis BSP has loyal followers among the Chamars, the cobbler community, but its influence is mostly limited to west Bihar districts bordering Uttar Pradesh. 

 It is also evident that a section of Dalits in Mustafapur will heed the Maoist election boycott call. The leaders canvassing do not come to our hamlet but go straight to the main village inhabited by people of superior pedigree, says Jago, sarcastically. We are not boycotting the polls. Rather the parties are boycotting us, he reasons. 

 The LJP manifesto, however, completely evades questions of implementing the minimum wages act, providing year-round employment for landless labourers or granting house sites on government land ? the demands dear to the Dalits.

 If the Dusadhs and Chamars go away to labour in the fields in the Green Revolution belt of north India or to build roads and houses in cities, there are other kinds of migrants as well in Mustafapur. Rajnandan Sharmas nephew is working with a UN organisation in Geneva. 

 My son works for an international travel agency at Delhi, says a visibly proud Sharma. Hailing from the powerful Bhumihar community, Sharma is quite vocal against Laloo Prasad Yadavs misrule. 

 A BJP supporter, Sharma unequivocally declares that his community will back the strongest available candidate against the RJD. The Dalits, however, are not that willing to speak their mind before perfect strangers. That may pose a problem for psephologists doing exit polls. Although Bhumihars, who claim to be equal to Brahmins in the caste hierarchy, do not till their land themselves, some poor Bhumihar peasants are shrugging off the caste taboo to take up the plough. 

 Tuntun Sharma is one such small farmer, but he continues to be politically aligned to the rich landowners of his community. 

 Harinandan Sharma, 85, another farmer, rightly points out the miserable condition of the village road and lack of irrigation facilities but is indifferent to the fact that labourers find it difficult to get loan even at the absurd rate of 8 per cent a month. That amounts to a 96-per cent annual interest in the current low-interest economic regime. But that, too, unfortunately is not an election issue, at least in Mustafapur.

 Stage set for Anjali trial

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, May 16: Flying Officer Anjali Gupta was arraigned by the general court martial today, setting the stage for her trial on charges of indiscipline, insubordination and financial irregularities. 

 The GCM also declined Guptas plea for a 20-day break to help her pick the best civil defence counsel. Gupta told the GCM that she was in touch with 22 lawyers across the country and it would take her 20 days to select the best. 

 The presiding officer, Group Captain V. Ganesh, said she will be given only two days to file a plea ? either questioning the jurisdiction or the process of initiating the GCM. 

 This (GCM) is being forced on me without a defence counsel, Gupta retorted.

 This morning, the GCM adjourned twice on the officers plea that she lacked the resources to hire a defence counsel. Gupta complained she had not been paid her salary for three months. The GCM instructed that the authorities at the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment produce her paybook and release her salary for the period. 

 However, on drawing the cash, Gupta raised her next plea ? that of the 20-day adjournment.

 As seven charges were read out by Squadron Leader S. Suhag, the judge advocate at the GCM, Gupta stayed silent. Group Captain Ganesh then declared that the officer has taken a decision on pleading not guilty.

 The prosecution, represented by Wing Commander D.R. Dubey, said he would request for summons to witnesses at the GCM tomorrow.

 Last week, the GCM adjourned for five days to provide Gupta the time to hire a defence counsel. Wing Commander Vijay Bhupesh, the defending officer, and Gupta had informed the court of differences on the line of attack and ground of attack on the plea to question its jurisdiction.

 A day later, on May 11, the court of inquiry ordered by the air force into charges of sexual harassment by Gupta against three senior officers decided to adjourn indefinitely as she chose to concentrate on the defence at the GCM.

 Kids dumped, parents held

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Lucknow, April 8: An unusual scene unfolded at Allahabad High Court yesterday when a man entered the courtroom carrying two sobbing toddlers in his arms.

 Justices Jagdish Bhalla and M.A. Khan of the high court?s Lucknow bench immediately took up his petition for hearing. It ordered that the children be put in a rescue home and directed police to arrest their parents, who had abandoned them.

 When Ramkali and Ramu fell out with each other and went their separate ways, they left their daughters on the street outside their house in Aziznagar colony on the outskirts of the city.

 For three days, Vandana, 2, and Kallu, 1, stayed without food or water. No one came to their rescue and pedestrians were seen hurling rotten bread at them.

 Ramkali went to live with her lover in Wazirganj colony while there was no news of Ramu.

 Yesterday, Sohan Pal, a resident of the colony who used to work in the high court, noticed the toddlers and brought them some milk. Later, accompanied by an advocate, he took them to the court.

 Ramu?s relatives tipped off the police this afternoon that he was staying in a hotel in the city. They raided the hotel and arrested him, while his wife was picked up from her lover?s house.

 The couple was sent to prison for inflicting physical and mental torture on their children. 

 The judges said that by abandoning the girls, their parents had pushed them to the brink of death. The incident speaks ?volumes about the brutal complex human nature?, the bench added.

 The court ordered the social welfare directorate to send the infants to a state-run children?s shelter and asked Child Line, an NGO, to oversee their well-being.

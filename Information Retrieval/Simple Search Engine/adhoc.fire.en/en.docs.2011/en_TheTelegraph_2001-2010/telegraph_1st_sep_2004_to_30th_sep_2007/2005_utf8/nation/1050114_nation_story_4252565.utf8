 Unequal aid cry in TN

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 Nagapattinam, Jan. 13: The district administration in this tsunami-hit area today denied reports that it was forcibly closing down relief centres even as community workers led by Medha Patkar alleged discrimination in relief distribution. 

 Patkar, who heads the National Alliance of People?s Movements, some of whose constituents are active participants in the rehabilitation effort, said relief was either being denied to Dalits or was not being given to them in adequate measure. 

 The focus of the administration has been on taking relief to the fishing community that has lost so many of its number, angering others. 

 Today, farmers blocked a road at Dharamkulam, about 40 km north of here, demanding relief for livelihood losses as the tsunami had left their land saline. ?They are doing everything for the fishermen and nothing for us,? Durai, the leader of the group, alleged.

 Shanta Sheela Nayar, the state rural development secretary and chief coordinator of the rehabilitation effort, said: ?The charge that any specific group is omitted or neglected is unfair. Compensation has been assured for any livelihood loss, not just fishing.?

 The protesters dispersed after the executive officer in charge of relief in Dharamkulam assured them of the minimum compensation for livelihood loss ? Rs 2,000 per person and 60 kg of rice. 

 They went back happy, but many others who are being sent to hastily built shacks from the relief centres opened in schools, colleges and wedding halls are resentful. 

 ?We were happier in the school. The summer sun will boil us under these metal roofs,? said Chella Thambi, a fisherman who lost his wife to the waves. ?But what can we do? We are at the mercy of the government.? 

 The people here are more comfortable with thatched houses. They fear the new 10ft by 12ft rooms will turn into furnaces under the hot sun.

 Thousands of the homeless survivors are being sent to the shelters ? built of bituminous walls with tin sheets for roof ? since chief minister Jayalalithaa decreed that the tsunami-hit must be able to celebrate Pongal in their own homes. There is also pressure on the administration to arrange for resumption of classes in the schools after the Pongal break.

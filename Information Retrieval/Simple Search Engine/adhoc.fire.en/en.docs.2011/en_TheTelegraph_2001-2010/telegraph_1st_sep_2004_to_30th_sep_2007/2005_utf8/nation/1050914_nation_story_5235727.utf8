 Rajasthan cattle not welcome in MP

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 TROUBLEMAKERS? 

 Bhopal, Sept. 13: Talk of cattle and Madhya Pradesh comes to mind.

 First it was former chief minister Uma Bharti who wanted a cattle-based, rather a cow-based economy. Now, the states forest minister, Himmat Kothari, has decided to lock horns with the neighbouring Rajasthan government over cattle from there grazing in the forests and farms of Madhya Pradesh.

 Kothari said he has written a letter to Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia seeking her intervention. 

 Two years ago, plagued by the invading herds of sheep, camels and cows from the neighbouring state, Madhya Pradesh had increased cattle-entry fee from Rs 8 per animal to Rs 40. 

 But the move served no purpose as the cattle owners took refuge in the Indian Forest Act that empowers forest officials to confiscate the cattle. But confiscating the herd means feeding the animals daily. So the officers did not act tough with the cattle owners.

 Kothari said the damage could not be calculated in terms of rupees, but reckless grazing not only ruins the crop, it also makes the land barren. The unlawful entry of cattle from Rajasthan has affected 18 districts of Madhya Pradesh, he claimed.

 His letter to Vasundhara Raje comes just a week after Archana Chitnis, the Madhya Pradesh minister for animal husbandry and cow conservation, announced the decision to buy 22,000 bulls from Rajasthan to have a better breed of cows in her state. 

 We are planning to get at least 22,000 bulls from Rajasthan. The bulls will be left in the villages and after a few years we will have cows of better breed, Ranjna Chowdhury, the principal secretary in the animal husbandry department said. 

 Another department official, who had accompanied Chitnis on her recent study tour to Rajasthan, said he had informed his counterparts there that the bulls should be gentle as the cows of Madhya Pradesh tend to be weak. They should give us bulls of good breed but of gentle nature and not the ones who are violent, he said. 

 Rajasthans indigenous Rathi breed of cows yield an average of eight to 10 litres of milk per day, which is three litres higher than a Madhya Pradesh cows yield. 

 But with Kotharis protest over straying cattle from Rajasthan the plan to buy the bulls could be ruined.

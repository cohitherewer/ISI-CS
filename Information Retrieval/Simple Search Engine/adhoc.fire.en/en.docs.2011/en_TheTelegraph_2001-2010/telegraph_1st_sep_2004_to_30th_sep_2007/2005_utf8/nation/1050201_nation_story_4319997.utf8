 Patna, Jan. 31: Protests and prayers continued today even as police recovered two boys and reports of more disappearances came in from different parts of the state.

 According to sources, a Class VIII student of Jhanjharpur in Madhubani district has allegedly been abducted by her tutor, a local cleric. Though the police claimed that the girl has eloped with her tutor, her mother suspected foul play by the cleric.

 As police continue their search for Kislay Kaushal, Deepak Kumar, Ravi Kant, Anjali Kumari and Ranjan Kumar, another student, Bablu Kumar of Jehanabad, is reportedly missing for a month. 

 There was some relief for the police when they rescued Rajnish and Deepak, who were missing from Muzaffarpur for almost a month, from Hajipur last evening. However, they could not arrest the kidnappers, who managed to escape.

 Nalanda police rescued businessman Deepak Kumar from a field in Hilsa last night and arrested one person in this connection. Kumar was kidnapped by unidentified criminals from Parwalpur under Hilsa police station on January 24. 

 So far, Patna police have questioned about two dozen people in connection with the abduction of Kislay. Some family members of the key suspect, Chunnu Thakur and his close associate Pappu Singh alias Vicky, are still in police custody.

 Police detained four and arrested three persons yesterday and also recovered a cellphone, suspected to have been used to demand ransom from a close relative of Kislay?s father Krishnakant Gupta, an assistant sales tax commissioner. The family, however, denied any ransom call.

 ?We are pursuing the case systematically and hope to rescue the boy soon,? senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan said.

 The city police lathicharged Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists who staged a dharna in front of the high court today to press their demand for the rescue of the missing children. A few activists were injured in the lathicharge.

 The Public School Association of Nalanda and ABVP have issued an ultimatum to the administration to rescue Ravi Kant by tomorrow. ABVP has also called a Biharsharif bandh on February 2.

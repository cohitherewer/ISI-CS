 Goa throne for Rane

 Rane: Record seventh term

 Panaji, June 6: Pratapsinh Rane will be the next Goa chief minister, the Congress announced today.

 Yesterday, the three-month-old impasse in the Goa Assembly was resolved when the Congress-led alliance won four of the five seats in the byelections. 

 Presidents rule is expected to be lifted soon and the Assembly taken out of suspended animation.

 Rane, 66, was unanimously elected, the Congress general secretary in charge of Goa, Margaret Alva, said after a meeting this afternoon. 

 Ranes name was proposed by Luizinho Faleiro and Dayanand Narvekar. Other contenders for the post were Faleiro and Ravi Naik, the Bahujan Samaj leader and former chief minister.

 Some argued that the Congress needed a Hindu chief minister to take on the BJPs growth in Goa.

 The Congress was silent on the cabinet formation or the deputy chief minister. However, Rane said he did not foresee any major problem. 

 Letters of support from two Nationalist Congress Party MLAs and one Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party MLA to the Congress are expected to be handed over by tomorrow morning.

 Rane, taking up his record seventh-term in office in an instability-prone state, said he would review the past decisions of the BJP government and retain the good ones. There would be no witch-hunt, he said.

 Only months ago, Rane had been accused of taking a soft stance towards the BJP. But the veteran leader came out strongly against the BJP when its members and allies started deserting the party earlier this year.

 Go-slow to slum drive

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: Mumbai?s Shanghai dream may have hit the aam aadmi roadblock. Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is believed to have been told by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to go slow on the demolition of Mumbai?s slums in view of the damage to the party?s pro-poor image.

 Deshmukh has been enthusiastically following up on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s election promise in Mumbai in October of transforming the city into a Shanghai ? by cleaning it up and building world-class urban infrastructure. 

 However, the chief minister has come under attack from within the Congress, particularly MPs from Mumbai, over the demolition of slums that came up after 2000.

 Deshmukh, emerging out of an hour-long meeting with Sonia at her 10 Janpath residence, said the demolition drive ? a promise made in the Nationalist Congress Party-Congress coalition?s joint manifesto for the 2004 October Assembly polls ? would continue. 

 However, the chief minister emphasised that he would go by whatever direction Sonia gave. ?She is our leader and whatever she says is our final direction.?

 The chief minister said slum-dwellers affected by the demolition drive would be provided alternative accommodation. 

 The government would come up with a programme addressing the human side, he said.

 However, sources said, the state government may have to rethink its demolition drive. There is stiff opposition from within the Mumbai Congress and the party?s central leadership believes the drive goes against its aam aadmi commitments at the national level.

 The Congress general secretary in charge of frontal organisations, Ashok Gehlot, went public in Mumbai this afternoon with the leadership?s misgivings about the drive. 

 The demolition goes against the United Progressive Alliance?s aam aadmi philosophy, he said.

 The leadership is also concerned that the demolition drive could harm the party?s prospects in the elections for the Mumbai municipal corporation, the richest civic body in the country, which is now controlled by the Shiv Sena-BJP combine.

 The chief minister, who was accompanied by Mumbai Congress chief Gurudas Kamath, is understood to have been summoned by the party president in the wake of complaints from Congress leaders of his region.

 Deshmukh, who was unceremoniously removed from the top post 20 months before the October 2004 polls, dismissed suggestions that complaints from within the party could have been aimed at unseating him a second time.

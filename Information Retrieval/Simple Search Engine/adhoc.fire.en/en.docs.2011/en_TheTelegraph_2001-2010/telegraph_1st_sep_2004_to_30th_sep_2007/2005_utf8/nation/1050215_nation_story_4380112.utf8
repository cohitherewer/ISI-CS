 Delhi walks tightrope

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: India 

 did a balancing act on Nepal today, reaffirming its commitment 

 to democracy but also making it clear that it has no choice 

 but to work with ?whichever government is exercising power? 

 in Kathmandu.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran said: ?While democracy remains India?s abiding conviction, the importance of our neighbourhood requires that we remain engaged with whichever government is exercising authority in any country in our neighbourhood.? Saran did not mention Nepal but it was clear which ?neighbourhood? country he had in mind.

 ?Abandonment of democracy? by King Gyanendra is not the solution to the problems in Nepal, but the country?s stability and progress also depends on the ?two pillars? of parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy, Delhi felt.

 Saran was ambiguous when asked whether India was contemplating suspension of arms supply to the Royal Nepal Army. 

 ?The issue was under continuous review,? is all he would say.

 On a day of diplomatic parleys, foreign minister Natwar Singh held discussions with Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, the Indian ambassador in Kathmandu, and Nepalese ambassador in Delhi Karna Dhoj Adhikary.

 The meeting between Singh and Mukherjee was the first between the two after the Indian envoy?s meeting with the king. The details were not made public.

 Singh is said to have told him that Delhi wanted restoration of democracy, freedom of press and immediate steps to release political leaders, rights activists and scribes. 

 To discuss Nepal among other things, British foreign secretary Jack Straw would arrive in India on Friday.

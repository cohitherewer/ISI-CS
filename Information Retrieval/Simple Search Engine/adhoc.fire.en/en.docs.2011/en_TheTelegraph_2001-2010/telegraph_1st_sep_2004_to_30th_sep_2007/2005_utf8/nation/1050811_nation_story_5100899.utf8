 Plastic shows steely face

 Sydney, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Australian scientists have developed a technique to use waste plastic in steel-making, a process that could have implications for recycling scrap metal that accounts for 40 per cent of steel production.

 Professor Veena Sahajwalla of the University of New South Wales has won a prestigious Australian science award for what she calls the hottest research in town, which she hopes will turn an environmental headache into a valuable resource.

 Under the process, waste plastics are fed into electric steel-making furnaces as an alternative source of carbon and heated to super-hot temperatures of 1,600 degrees Celsius.

 Sahajwalla said many waste plastics, from shopping bags to dishwashing liquid containers and drink bottles, contain high-enough levels of carbon to be useful in steel-making. Carbon is used to add strength to steel. 

 What happens in a steel-making furnace is that we are melting scrap steel, you can imagine if youve got your old cars and washing machines and so on, Sahajwalla said. 

 The carbon component thats present inside plastic is what were after and, at those high temperatures, were able to react it in a way that were able to use that carbon thats locked in the plastics. Typically you would add coal and coke, she said. 

 Sahajwalla, who did her BTech from IIT Kanpur, got her PhD in metals and materials and engineering from University of Michigan. She works with the New South Wales universitys School of Materials Science and Engineering.

 Clyde Henderson, of coal industry newsletter Energy Economics, said similar technology using pellets of recycled plastic had been used in firing power stations in Japan. 

 I guess its probably going to be, in terms of proportion of feed for these kinds of plants, a relatively minor kind of thing, Henderson said.

 I dont think the coal industry would see it as a threat. Its more an environmental angle, I think, he said.

 Sahajwalla said her process did not replace all of the coal and coke, but still used a mix of plastic and coal.

 Australia is the worlds top coal exporter, shipping 122 million tonnes of metallurgical grade coal worth $6.8 billion last year.

 Australians use roughly a million tonnes of plastics a year, much of which ends up as waste destined for landfills.

 If youve got a whole lot of waste plastics that end up in landfill, not just in Australia but across the world, then its really coming up with alternative technology for its disposal which is environmentally friendly, Sahajwalla said.

 She won one of the Australian Museums Eureka prizes for achievements in science for her work yesterday and said she was in talks about industrial applications for her project.

 She said PVC was one of few plastics not suitable for the process because of potentially carcinogenic emissions when burnt.

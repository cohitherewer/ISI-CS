 Triple talaq after rape by in-law

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, June 14: The first blow came from her father-in-law. It left her traumatised.

 The second came from her husband. It devastated her.

 The third came from the local qazi. It left her without a home.

 It took just three days ? and the curse that reigns the countrys backwaters ? for the world that Imrana Bibi had painstakingly built for more than seven years to turn upside down.

 Raped by her father-in-law and divorced by her husband, the 25-year-old mother of five was ordered out of her village yesterday by the local cleric. 

 Since rape by her father-in-law had altered her relation with her husband, Imrana can neither live in her in- laws house nor in the village, Maulana Shamim Ahmed said at the panchayat session in Charthabal Kamba village in Uttar Pradeshs Muzaffarnagar district. The verdict, he added, was in conformity with the shariat.

 The decision, which has come after the All India Muslim Personal Law Board recently banned triple talaq, left scholars and social workers aghast.

 We have been campaigning against the dangers of triple talaq and trying to educate qazis to save women from whimsical justice, said Kalbe Sadiq, the vice-president of the Muslim law board.

 The verdict is arbitrary and whimsical. Neither the triple talaq is valid nor the decision forcing her to leave the village. Shariat has never supported atrocities on women like rape by a father-in-law, said Purveen Abdi, an office-bearer of the Muslim Women Personal Law Board.

 Imranas ordeal began on the night of June 11 when her husband was away in Muzaffarnagar town. Her 59-year-old father-in-law, Ali Mohammad, dragged her into his room and raped her.

 The next day, when Nur Elahi returned, Imrana told her husband of the assault. Instead of sympathising, he became furious. You cannot be my wife any more, the 32-year-old shouted before uttering the three dreaded words.

 On June 13, Imranas relatives approached the panchayat, which held the hearing in the afternoon.

 The qazi is right. What is the point of living in a village where my husband could not protect me from the sexual assault of his father and instead uttered the triple talaq, Imrana said as she left for Kukra, the village that was home before her marriage.

 But Imrana left without her five children, the youngest 2 and the eldest 7. Let the qazi look after my children, she said.

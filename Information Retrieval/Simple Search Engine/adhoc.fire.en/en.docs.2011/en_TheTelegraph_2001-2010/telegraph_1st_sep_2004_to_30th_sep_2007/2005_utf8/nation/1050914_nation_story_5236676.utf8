 Jaya changes tack

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 13: Their faces shone as Mohammed Ali and Basha stepped onto the dais. The two jobless young men from Coimbatore bowed as they received the keys of their autorickshaws from the Tamil Nadu chief minister.

 Whether to atone for her once pro-BJP stance or woo a crucial vote bank in a pre-election year, Jayalalithaa has started a new job scheme for Muslim youths. 

 Mohammed Ali and Basha were the face of the project today, along with four other Muslim youths.

 The scheme involves three industrial cooperative societies, floated to provide self-employment opportunities to Muslim youths in the three districts the community is concentrated in: Coimbatore, Tirunelveli and Vellore.

 Please make full use of my governments schemes and come up in life, Jayalalithaa urged as she handed over the keys of brand new Bajaj autos to six Muslim men (two from each district) at a function organised by the state small industries department here. 

 In all, 121 jobless Muslim youths have been selected under this programme to make a living by driving autorickshaws.

 Small industries secretary Rajendran later told reporters that each autorickshaw costs Rs 87,000 under this scheme but the beneficiary needs to come up with only 5 per cent of the amount (4,350) in the form of a lump sum. Most of the cost ? 85 per cent ? is taken care of through a term loan (at a low interest rate of 6 per cent) and the remaining 10 per cent is provided as subsidy by the government.

 Rajendran explained why the scheme had become necessary. 

 The central minorities development corporation had always been ready with the funds to be channelled to beneficiaries through the state minorities development corporation, he said. But the nationalised banks in Tamil Nadu declined to underwrite or stand guarantee for the loan component. So the funds available for self-employment schemes for the minorities got blocked.

 But with Jayalalithaa keen to go ahead with this programme, the state-level Tamil Nadu Industrial Co-operative (Tico) Bank, under the small industries department, offered to come forward and take the risk of recovering the loans from the beneficiaries, Rajendran said.

 As Tico Bank rules require that it lend only to industrial co-operative societies, the Muslim youths in the three districts were encouraged to form such societies to allow the loans and subsidies to be channelled to them, Rajendran said.

 Comrades at each others neck

 - Vicious infighting over lucrative businesses bleeds Kerala CPM

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 21: In Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal, the CPM has just put behind it an ideological war over providing agricultural land for industries to come up.

 In hardline ideologue Prakash Karats Kerala ? also bound for Assembly polls in 2006 ? a far more vicious infighting is bleeding the party. And ideology seems to have little to do with it.

 The stakes in the battle are the Kerala CPMs lucrative businesses that have swelled the partys kitty to Rs 4,000 crore. Whoever holds sway in the party gets to control its array of rather unproletarian assets, which include a flourishing TV channel and furniture business as well as a soon-to-come-up amusement park and shopping mall.

 The man currently holding the reins is Pinarayi Vijayan, state CPM secretary, who hopes to be chief minister if the party wins the 2006 polls.

 The challenger is leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, V.S. Achuthanandan, 79, who commands cadre loyalty at the grassroots. 

 Achuthanandan was among those who had walked out of a conference of the undivided CPI in Punjab 41 years ago, triggering the crisis that led to the birth of the CPM.

 He is the reason the state leadership is wary of taking a hardline stand against the dissidents, for this could lead a sizeable section of party officials and cadre to walk out.

 The rebels, however, suffered heavy losses at the last state party conference in Malappuram. Twelve of Achuthanandans supporters lost the election to the state committee after angering the leadership by contesting. Two were dropped from the state party secretariat, constituted after the conference.

 Vijayan has also stripped Achuthanandan of his post as editor of the party newspaper, Desabhimani, the third-largest daily in Kerala.

 On his part, Achuthanandan refused to defend Vijayan when the Assembly debated the controversial Rs 375-crore power contract awarded to the Canada-based SNC Lavalin during the state secretarys tenure as power minister in the E.K. Nayanar cabinet.

 The CPM central leadership is appalled at the goings-on. The party expresses serious concern at the persisting disunity and factional tendencies in Kerala, the organisational report at the 18th party congress said.

 The CPM has set up two committees to identify those who engineered the factionalism at the state conference and those behind media leaks.

 Party leaders should not make any public utterances expressing their differences either impliedly or explicitly, the report said. Some of them behave like members of some bourgeois political party.

 Sure enough, the state CPM bosses are into all sorts of money-spinning businesses. The party has set up the thriving Kairali TV channel. The CPM-backed Rubwood, based in the northern Kannur district, is the states leading furniture manufacturer.

 In Kannur, the Malabar Pleasures Ltd, a water theme park, is nearing completion. Its promoters are district CPM leaders, who floated the project with funds from party-backed cooperatives.

 A multi-crore superspeciality hospital-cum-shopping complex is coming up at Thalassery in Kannur.

 But the real battle will be over the chief ministership in 2006. Vijayan is backed by the strong Kannur lobby. Achuthanandan was poised to be chief minister in 1996 but he lost the election because of sabotage, paving the way for Nayanars third term in office.

 Pro-CPM intellectuals, led by Prof. M.N. Vijayan, have lent an ideological underpinning to the factional war. 

 The latest issue of the Padham magazine, which they have revived, targeted the party secretary and his lieutenants, such as party central secretariat member M.A. Baby and legislator T.M. Thomas Isaac, terming them revisionists.

 Baby has been attacked for his 

 bourgeois proclivities for high-society life 

 while Isaac has been accused of working to dilute the partys 

 class character and turn it into a social democratic outfit. 

 A work by Isaac and US anthropologist Richard Franke is 

 seen as advancing class cooperation in opposition to class 

 conflict.

 Digvijay: Making waves

 Bhopal, March 23: Digvijay Singh may have been routed in Madhya Pradesh and might be struggling to survive in the ?Delhi durbar? as Congress general secretary but his 10-year rule continues to enjoy global attention.

 From London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and the University of Sussex to the World Bank, academics and policy-makers are analysing the impact of his reformist agenda.

 LSE?s Development Studies Institute has included his Rogi Kalyan Samiti mission in its curriculum. Launched during Digvijay?s second term as chief minister (1998-2003), this project involved people?s representatives in the management of hospitals and aimed to improve their functioning by levying user charges.

 The project won laurels from Union finance minister P. Chidambaram, who announced in this budget that the model would be included in the National Rural Health Mission.

 LSE recently invited S.R. Mohanty, a close Digvijay aide who is now state secretary, women and child welfare department, to deliver a lecture. Mohanty had worked on the project as Indore collector.

 In 2000, the project won the Global Development Network Award, the largest international contest for researchers on development. The World Bank and the World Health Organisation were part of the jury.

 Madhya Pradesh has also been taken up as a case study by LSE?s Crisis States Research Centre, which monitors under-performing states across the world. The research seeks to uncover the motivation and impact of reforms introduced in Madhya Pradesh.

 The World Bank has commissioned a study to assess if there was a link between the reforms and Digivijay?s election defeat. The former chief minister has been invited to speak at its headquarters in Washington next month but has not made up his mind yet.

 James Manor, a professor at Sussex University, has also conducted a detailed study on Digvijay. In a book yet to be published, Manor has compared leaders in Brazil, Madhya Pradesh and Uganda who tried to help the poor. 

 Manor told The Telegraph via email that Digvijay?s basic aims were to make government more responsive and to broaden the base of the Congress. ?He increased the reach of government services, despite fiscal constraints, by training a large number of para-professionals to deliver them. Some programmes like panchayati raj were intended for the population in general. Others like the education guarantee scheme and the Dalit agenda were aimed at stimulating demands from poorer groups who had previously made few claims on government, and at responding to those demands. Taken together ? despite some failures and many ambiguities ? these initiatives constitute an impressive developmental record.?

 Manor said while Digvijay succeeded in raising people?s aspirations, he failed to meet them. ?By stressing social sectors, the government fell short on tangibles like roads, and in providing electricity. This enabled the BJP ? using a very narrow definition of ?development? to imply power and roads ? to argue that the government had failed.?

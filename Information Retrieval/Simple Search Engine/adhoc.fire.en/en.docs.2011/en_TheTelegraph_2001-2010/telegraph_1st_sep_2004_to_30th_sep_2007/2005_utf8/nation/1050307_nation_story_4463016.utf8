 New Delhi, March 6: Over 4.75 lakh skilled and semi-skilled workers travelled to the Gulf region in search of better-paying jobs last year.

 The largest numbers were from the southern states ? Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, followed by Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat. Number nine on the list is Bihar while Karnataka at number 10 brings up the rear.

 Tamils have consistently topped the list with the maximum number of 1,08,964 given emigration clearance in 2004. In 2000, the number from Tamil Nadu was 63,878. In 2001, the figure went down slightly to 61,649, rising again in 2002 to 79,165 and in 2003 to 89,464.

 Andhra is in second place with 72,580 registered to go to the Gulf in 2004. In 2000, just about 29,999 people left the state to go abroad. While in 2001 ,the number went up to 37,331, there was a slight increase the next year to 38,417. In 2003, this figure jumped to 65,0971 and in 2004 reached 72,580.

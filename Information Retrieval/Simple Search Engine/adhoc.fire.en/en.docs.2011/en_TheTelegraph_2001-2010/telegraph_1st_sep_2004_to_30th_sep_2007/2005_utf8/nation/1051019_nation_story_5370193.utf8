 Bihar case 

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Supreme Court has declined to hear a clarification application on the Bihar elections on the ground that its reasoned and detailed judgment would be pronounced soon and a separate clarification was not needed, reports our legal correspondent. 

 A division bench rejected the application by apex court lawyer Viplav Sharma, who contended that according to the October 7 order of the court, the dissolved Assembly still exists and there could not be two Assemblies for the same term.

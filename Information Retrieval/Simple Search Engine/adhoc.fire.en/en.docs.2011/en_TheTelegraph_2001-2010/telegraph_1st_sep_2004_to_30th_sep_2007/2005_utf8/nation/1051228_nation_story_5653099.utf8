 Plan to embrace special kids

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 27: The Centre is planning to introduce inclusive education for children with disabilities, a policy that will allow them to enrol in mainstream schools.

 At present, such children attend special schools and there have been complaints that some are cut off from the rest of society. 

 The human resource development ministry has held several rounds of consultations since October this year to discuss the new policy.

 Officials say the objective behind the policy is to end the current segregation that keeps children with disabilities apart from other children. 

 The policy will also try to ensure that the mainstream education system is affordable and accessible for children with special needs.

 India has 90 million people with disabilities. They have never been on the agenda of policymakers till Parliament passed a bill in 1995 to give people with disabilities equal opportunities and rights.

 Social activists had welcomed the legislation but took care to point out that law alone cannot change society. 

 The 1995 legislation was moved with the aim to help people with disabilities integrate with mainstream society. The activists say the law has made some difference but social integration still remains a mirage.

 The ministry officials are hoping to bridge this barrier through the new education policy. 

 Children with disabilities should be in the mainstream education system to the extent possible, says the inclusive education charter.

 In case of persons with severe multiple and intellectual disability, home-based learning should be available. The policy will provide for hostels for girls with disabilities.

 The draft also calls for stress on job-oriented training programmes while devising education schemes for students with special needs.

 Acknowledging the challenges that the task entails, the minister has listed several features the programme needs to incorporate for it to make a difference.

 Some of them include preparing the non-disabled student community for the inclusive education, special training for teachers and induction of parents of the disabled children into the school education committee.

 The schools will also have to install aids and appliances needed for children with special needs. They will have to establish a network of alliances with special schools and enlist the help of caregivers and educators. 

 The ministry officials say inclusive education will be an important area in the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan ? a central project to universalise elementary education.

 The programme, according to the officials, will have to make a concerted effort to detect children with special needs. 

 Identification of children with special needs should become an integral part of micro planning and household surveys, an official adds.

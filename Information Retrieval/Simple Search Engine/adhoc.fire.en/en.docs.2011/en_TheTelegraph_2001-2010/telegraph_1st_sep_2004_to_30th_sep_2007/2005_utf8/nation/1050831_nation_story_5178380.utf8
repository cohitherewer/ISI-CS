 Prison doors open for Sarabjit visitors

 Sarabjit

New Delhi/ Islamabad, Aug. 30: India and Pakistan today opened the doors of their high-security prisons to each other and held out the promise of releasing dozens of civilians who had strayed across the frontiers.

 The agreement came on a day two Indian diplomats met death-row convict Sarabjit Singh in a Lahore prison and New Delhi allowed visiting interior secretary Syed Kamal Shah to meet two Pakistanis in Tihar jail.

 In Chandigarh, Sarabjits family said they would request former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to ask Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to pardon the condemned man, sentenced for spying and involvement in bomb blasts.

 Vajpayee commands more respect than Manmohan Singh in Pakistan, Sarabjits sister Dalbir Kaur said. After all, he was the one who initiated the peace dialogue between the two countries. 

 In Delhi, the home secretaries of the two countries ended two days of talks with the agreement to free all fishermen and civilian prisoners who have completed their sentences by September 12. 

 V.K. Duggal and Shah also stressed their commitment to combat terrorism and drug trafficking.

 Making release of prisoners much easier, both sides said they would provide immediate notification of arrests and consular access to all arrested persons in three months and release prisoners immediately after they complete their terms.

 There were, however, allegations that the neighbours would swap spies in the name of releasing civilian prisoners.

 In Lahore, a two-member team from the Indian high commission met Sarabjit. The environment (of the meeting) was good, diplomat Deepak Kaul told reporters after the meeting in Kot Lakhpat jail.

 The diplomats took Sarabjits picture and asked him about his family members and friends back home in Amritsar. Sarabjit Singh also has a message for his family, which will be conveyed to them, Kaul said, but did not disclose what it was.

 We had an hour long meeting with Sarabjit during which he gave us a number of his personal details as well as his side of the story, Kaul said.

 Kaul said the tall, lanky man appeared very intelligent and fairly knowledgeable and spoke English and Hindi well. Kaul said he identified himself as Sarabjit Singh and not Manjit Singh as Pakistan claims.

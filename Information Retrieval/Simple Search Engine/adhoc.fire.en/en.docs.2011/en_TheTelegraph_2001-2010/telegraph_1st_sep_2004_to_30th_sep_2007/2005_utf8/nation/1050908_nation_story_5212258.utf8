 With Ganesh, Mumbai acts correct

 Mumbai, Sept. 7: Floods have washed away their homes, disease lurks in the teeming lanes and houses are crumbling around sleeping dwellers. But Mumbai smiled again today after days of gloom as it welcomed home the god who removes hurdles.

 The 10-day Ganesh festival began today, though the celebrations were subdued as memories of the July 26 deluge and its aftermath remained fresh in the citys collective consciousness.

 Who can forget the trauma? But we decided that we should not let it destroy our spirit, said Tapas Kumar Dev, a senior service engineer with Air-India and general secretary of the Air-India Colony Association. One of the worst hit by the deluge, the colony, home to over 550 families, has welcomed the elephant-headed god.

 Located next to the domestic airport at Kalina in Santa Cruz, the ground floor homes at the colony remained submerged in nearly 15 feet water for three days. There was no drinking water and no electricity for nearly a week.

 Ours is one of the oldest Ganesh pandals. We didnt have as much funds as previous years. Whatever funds we raised went into helping those affected by the flood. We distributed free notebooks to 400 children yesterday. So we have kept the decorations simple, but ensured that all of us participate in the celebrations, Dev said.

 Rather than spend on lavish decorations, the 8,000-plus Ganesh pandals in the city have chosen to use the cash donations from people to help flood victims. Everybody should help when the city is just recovering from a major tragedy, said Pandurang Jadhav, the convener of the coordination committee of Ganesh pandals.

 One tragedy followed another. If the rain killed over 650 people and over 200 died from water-borne diseases, another 24 perished in four building collapses in the past month-and-a-half.

 We have cancelled the normal cultural programmes we organise every year and merely focused on the regular Ganesh pujas, said Sanjay Bhagwat, chief executive officer of the Siddhivinayak Temple, which sees the largest congregation of devotees during the festival.

 The temple engaged Sanjay Dabhade, who designed the sets for the Paris wedding of steel baron Laxmi Mittals daughter, to create a replica of a Thai Hindu temple this year. The celebrities and VIPs who thronged the temple included Shiv Sena leader Raj Thackeray and actors Jeetendra and Sridevi. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh performed puja at his official residence.

 Mumbai police deployed over 15,000 officers to maintain security at pandals.

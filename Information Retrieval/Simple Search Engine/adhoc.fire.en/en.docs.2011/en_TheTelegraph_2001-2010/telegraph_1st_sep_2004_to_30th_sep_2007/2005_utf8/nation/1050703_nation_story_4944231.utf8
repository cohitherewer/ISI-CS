 RSS returns split compliment

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Advani

 New Delhi, July 2: If some in the BJP felt the RSS must stick to its mandate of merely offering ideological and philosophical guidance and not micro-manage the partys affairs, a section of the Sangh, too, was veering round to the belief that the BJP should be dumped because it had become a liability.

 Sangh sources maintained that after the Jinnah controversy which L.K. Advani triggered, some of the leaders felt that rather than getting entangled in the mess of who should lead the BJP and how it ought to be restructured, it was more tenable to look at life after the BJP.

 They reportedly thought that rather than floating a separate party ? as the VHP proposed ? the RSS should build itself as a powerful pressure group which would be in a position to do business with any party and push its agenda through. 

 There is a constant hardcore Hindu vote bank which will not brook any dilution on secularism or Pakistan. This is our constituency. Those parties which want their votes can always take our help and if they are in power, fulfil some part of our agenda. This is a more realistic option than having another party if the RSS is to snap its links with the BJP in future, a source said.

 The sources said in the 1984 polls, the Sangh had backed the Congress as we believed it was the first pro-Hindu election. In Kerala and Assam, where the RSS had an independent presence, it has had strategic alliances with the Congress and the AGP.

 The sources admitted that the RSS had a forgettable experience in the last Jammu and Kashmir polls when it had its own party, the Jammu Mukti Morcha, to protest the BJPs alliance with the National Conference. Apart from wiping out the BJP in Jammu, the JMM came a cropper. 

 Describing Advanis statements in Pakistan as nothing short of a betrayal, they said it was his attitude that provoked some Sangh leaders to think of a non-BJP option.

 The popular perception is that it was his remarks on Jinnah that angered our leaders. It is not just the remarks but the abruptness with which he sought to switch his image from being a swayamsevak to a secular-liberal politician that stunned us. About A.B. Vajpayee, we had no illusions because he was always 80 per cent of a swayamsevak and 20 per cent autonomous, a source said.

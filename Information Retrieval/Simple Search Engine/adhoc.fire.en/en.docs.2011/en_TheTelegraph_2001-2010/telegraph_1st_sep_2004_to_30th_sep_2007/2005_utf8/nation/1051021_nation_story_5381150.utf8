 Television latches on to gaming business 

 - Calling Casual players

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 New platform

 Mumbai, Oct. 20: Gaming has arrived on Indian television.

 AXN is just out with its new gaming show, GameMax, and MTV is all set to follow suit.

 We call GameMax a magazine show really and it aims at introducing gaming to the casual gamer. We will talk about all aspects of gaming, says Rohit Bhandare, director, sales and marketing, AXN.

 Sure enough, only about three minutes of the half-hour weekly show are used for gaming with the rest of the time spent on updating viewers on the latest games, as well as news, previews and jargon.

 It is certainly not a geek-focused show. The target audience is the lay viewer with a passing interest in gaming, says Bhandare.

 The channel seems to have timed its entry well, with a host of new-generation consoles coming up from Sony and other players next year. The market seems poised for a boom with the entry of PS3 and Xbox 360 gaming machines. Sony owns AXN.

 Research by AC Nielson estimates that the gaming market will be around Rs 700 crore by the year-end.

 With the gaming target audience in the 15-35 bracket, MTV, which calls itself Indias only youth channel, is not far behind. GamePad, the channels internationally known gaming show, could soon be on air.

 Although Star One was the first channel to launch a gaming show in India, Games Bond is said to have flopped because it was aimed at the geek.

 AXNs first show was aired on October 16. 

 To make it interactive, the programme will have a weekly contest ? GameMax Gamer of the Week ? for viewers. To participate, viewers have to log on to Games2win.com and play the game of the week. Winners can take home a Sony PS2, Sony PSP or an iPod every week. 

 AXN has also planned the GameMax Gaming Championship for India, where 15 contestants will vie for the title. TV actor Salil Acharya will host the championship.

 Of the 15 contestants chosen by AXN from 55,000 entries to play initially, four were under 14. 

 The youngest contestant to be shortlisted is a 12-year-old boy from Delhi. But I must point out that the other, in fact the majority, come from all parts of India and not necessarily urban areas. Our experience showed that the appeal is certainly not metro-centric, says Bhandare.

 GameMax will be promoted the same way that Sony showcases its movies ? with behind-the-scenes peeks and conversations with gamers. 

 Sony-AXN is looking at the consumer market. Thats our primary focus, Bhandare stresses.

 Alok Kejriwal, CEO, Contest2Win.com, says: We launched games2win.com this August with the intent of making gaming an easy and acceptable form of entertainment sport. With AXN, too, targeting the casual player, they are our natural partner?. The response from the advertisers has been great so far.

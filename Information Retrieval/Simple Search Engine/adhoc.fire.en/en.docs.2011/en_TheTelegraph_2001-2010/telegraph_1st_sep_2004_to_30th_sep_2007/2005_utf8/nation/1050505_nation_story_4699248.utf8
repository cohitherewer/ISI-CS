 Junk report, cries Cong

 New Delhi, May 4: The disclosure that Justice S.N. Phukan had used the air force?s VIP aircraft while investigating charges against the then defence minister has put the fate of his report in jeopardy.

 The Congress today seized on defence minister Pranab Mukherjee?s statement in Parliament to demand that the Phukan report be junked.

 The report is said to have given a clean chit to Mukherjee?s predecessor George Fernandes on the Tehelka expose on defence deals, though the retired judge has insisted that he had merely observed that no ?major irregularities? could be found. 

 ?The Phukan commission report is a case of cover-up and match-fixing. Its contents should be viewed in this context. It should be rejected and junked,? Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said. 

 Party sources said several crores were spent by way of salaries to commission officials, infrastructure and travel but only to shield Fernandes. ?Now the real probe will be conducted by the CBI to which the Tehelka scam has been handed over,? a leader said.

 The ruling party also sought to link the Opposition?s boycott of Parliament to the Phukan controversy.

 The Congress move to debunk the report came close on the heels of Mukherjee?s confirmation in Parliament that the retired judge had availed the services of VIP aircraft of the IAF for travel to Shirdi, Pune, Ahmednagar and Mumbai soon after he replaced Justice Venkataswami as the one-man judicial panel to continue the Tehelka probe in 2003.

 The then defence minister (Fernandes) had made available the VIP aircraft, though normal government procedure did not allow that, Mukherjee said. 

 ?The commission has willingly compromised its credibility by availing the hospitality from a person facing allegations which were the subject of its inquiry,? Sharma said. He hastened to add that the fate of the report would have to be decided by the government.

 However, Sharma?s strong remarks, which stood out in sharp contrast with the measured tone of Mukherjee in the House, are being seen as a reflection of the party leadership?s mood to step up the offensive against the NDA.

 The Congress never lent any credibility to the Phukan commission and the UPA government had wound up the panel by not extending its term when it ended late last year. 

 Until NDA leaders talked about the existence of a Phukan commission report (one part of the three-part report planned by Phukan when the commission was closed), the UPA government did not even acknowledge the existence of such a document. 

 At the beginning of the second phase of the budget session last month, the government had assured the Opposition that the Phukan commission findings, along with an action-taken report from the government, would be tabled in Parliament before the conclusion of the session on May 13.

 That appears doubtful after the Congress spokesperson?s outburst. 

 On the contrary, Sharma said that if at all anything had to be considered, it should be Justice Venkataswami?s findings on the Tehelka probe which he conducted for nearly two years between 2001 and 2003.

 Sharma said Venkataswami had completed 90 per cent of the job and his ?under-preparation report? should be made public as it would throw light on the direction of his inquiry.

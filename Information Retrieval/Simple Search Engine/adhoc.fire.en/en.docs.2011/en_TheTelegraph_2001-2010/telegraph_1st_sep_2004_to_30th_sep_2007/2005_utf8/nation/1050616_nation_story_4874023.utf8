 Bengal ring in Tibet call

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Tourists on Basongcuo Lake in the Nyingchi region 

 Nyingchi (eastern Tibet), June 15: Go tell the world that we want investors to come and we offer them all facilities. Our party will do everything for development. Familiar stuff for someone from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal. 

 The scene is in a remote corner of eastern Tibet, some 400 km from Lhasa. For hundreds of centuries, Nyingchi has lived in its splendid isolation, its earth watered by Yarlung Zangbo ? Tibets largest river which becomes the Brahmaputra when it flows into India ? and surrounded by three ranges of snow-capped mountains, the highest of the peaks rising to 7,780 metres.

 But all that matters now for its people is development ? and that at a great speed.

 Baimalang Jie, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Partys unit in the Nyingchi prefecture, said that to his comrades at the party meeting this morning. The picturesque town has a few billboards put up for the party meeting, but only the development agenda rings loud and clear.

 We want the party cadre as well as the people to be rich, he says. Even for this far corner of China, Deng Xiaopings dictum ? To get rich is glorious ? has captured the partys ? and the peoples ? imagination.

 And to get rich quickly, the prefecture government and the party are following policies that are not very different from what Bhattacharjee has been trying in Calcutta. 

 In 2003, the local government adopted two new policies to develop the prefectures economy. It opened up the place to foreign investment and to private investment.

 But Nyingchis development drive had begun earlier, prompted by the guidelines of the Chinese Community Partys third working group on Tibet in 1994. Today, we have the highest per capita income among the six prefectures in Tibet. Our GDP growth last year was 17 per cent, Jie smiles. 

 And for an area where transportation has meant horse-rides and walks across mountains for centuries, it now has 3,276 km of asphalted road. That has made it possible for Nyingchi to make 73 million yuan from tourism. 

 The partys development message seems to have been taken seriously by comrades even in villages, where private enterprise and making money set the political rules.

 Gongzhong on the outskirts of Nyingchi town has thus become a model village. All its 21 households have telephones, which they put to all kinds of commercial use. 

 And the success story of the village has reached far and wide. The result is that most of the tourists who come here make it a point to visit the village. And last year, the village raised 80,000 yuan from the tickets for tourists.

 There is still such poverty, though, in many of the villages. So, while it sends out the message to the cadre to get rich quickly, the party meeting today also asked each member to take charge of one poor family. The idea, the local party boss says, is to help the family get rich sooner rather than later.

 Downpour fails to dampen Uma salvo

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 28: The weather might have played spoilsport but it was no damper for Uma Bharati?s fiery tirade against the ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 ?There is no chance for the RJD to form the new government in Bihar, I?ll just not allow him (RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav) to do so,? Bharati blared from the dais at a rain-washed public meeting in Arah this afternoon.

 In her typical fiery style, Bharati took on Laloo headlong on deteriorating law and order and lack of development. 

 ?Political patronage by the government, especially the ruling RJD, is the only reason why things have come to such a pass here,? she said in the context of the latest furore over abductions of students in the state. She cited the example of how a special task force solved a major kidnap case in MP during her brief rule.

 ?On the development front, too, you can see what I have done as the chief minister in just nine months,? she added.

 The firebrand leader did not spare the Congress either. It (Congress party) ditched us when we wanted to throw the Laloo-Rabri regime out. It is hand-in-glove with the RJD and would not allow any good to take place here,? she told the crowd.

 Bharati arrived in Patna this morning for her first round of campaigning for three days and left for Ara in Bhojpur, after which she would campaign in Rohtas, Aurangabad and Gaya before leaving for Haryana. 

 She would return in the first week of February for another round of campaigning.

 BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan, too, came down heavily on RJD while addressing a press meet in Patna. Blaming the state government for all the ills, he said Laloo Yadav?s party does not even understand what is development. 

 ?The decision to install mobile phone jammers in a jail where using phones are banned shows that the government is not in control of things here. It simply reflects its failure,? Mahajan said.

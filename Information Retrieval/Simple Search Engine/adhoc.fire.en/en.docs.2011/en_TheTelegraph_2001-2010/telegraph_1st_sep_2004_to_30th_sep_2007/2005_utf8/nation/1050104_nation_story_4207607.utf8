 Raman village in name game

 R. KRISHNA DAS 

 Raipur, Jan. 3: Thathapur, the native village of Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh in Kawardha district, will soon have a new name. 

 The local panchayat, which feels the existing name is ?odd? and not in keeping with the status of its illustrious son-of-the-soil, has formally passed a resolution and urged the government to change it.

 ?The ?odd? name of the village was quoted as one of the reasons for the proposed change in name,? Kawardha district collector S.K. Tiwari said. 

 After receiving the gram panchayat?s proposal to change the name to Rampur, the administration forwarded it to the state revenue department, which is yet to act on it due to the civic and panchayat elections.

 The chief minister himself has agreed to the change in name. His father, Vignaharan Singh, too has signed the memorandum submitted by the villagers to rename Thathapur after the chief minister?s great-grandfather, Thakur Ram Singh. 

 But veteran Congress leader and former Kawardha MLA Hameedullah Khan said: ?Changing the names of old villages is not a good practice. quot; After all, Thathapur has a glorious past. When a severe drought hit the region way back in 1856, it was in Thathapur where mass feasts were organised by Thakur Ram Singh to feed the people of 20 villages. After changing the name, history has to be rewritten to associate the generous work of Thakur Ram Singh with the proposed Rampur.?

 ?In Chhattisgarh, most of villages have odd names. The name of my native village, Ghogha, sounds more peculiar than Thathapur. But does it mean I will recommend a change of name?? he added.

 End in sight for Taj ownership tussle

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Taj Mahal

 Lucknow, June 8: Who does the Taj Mahal belong to? The Sunni Waqf Board will give its verdict on June 25.

 The board today heard the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which maintains the monument, and a Sunni petitioner who insisted the property belongs to the community.

 Irfan Beddar, a member of the waqf board, had filed a petition in the high court last year demanding that the Taj ? the worlds most famous monument to love ? be declared Sunni property.

 As a debate erupted on the issue with some smelling a political motive ? the Sunni board members are known to be close to the ruling Samajwadi Party ? the court in November 2004 referred the matter to the board, a quasi-judicial body authorised to hear any dispute over the communitys property. 

 Hearings began in April this year, but today was the first time that the ASI appeared. Its advocate, A.D.N Rao, argued that the board did not have the right to hear this dispute as the Ancient Monuments (preservation) Act, 1904, and Archaeological Remains (declaration of national importance) Act, 1954, authorised the ASI to protect and maintain the world heritage site.

 Under Section 4 and 6 of Waqf Act, any property is brought under survey for the purpose of declaring it as waqf property. There has been a survey of all waqf properties of some importance and they have been registered. Why did the Taj property not come under the survey so far? Why is the board raising this issue now? Rao asked.

 The petitioners counsel, Idris Ahmed, shot back that any Muslim monument having a mosque and a mausoleum automatically becomes waqf property and there is no time bar for the survey. At the Taj, there is a mosque where Friday prayers are held and there is the mausoleum of Mumtaz Mahal, for whom emperor Shah Jahan had the monument built. So this property should be declared a Sunni property, he argued.

 The boards standing counsel, Mohammad Ali, tried to argue that bringing Taj, which draws tourists by the droves, under waqf would not make a difference. He pointed out that the Jama Masjid has been declared a Sunni property. But the ASI advocate told the court that Jama Masjid is not a protected monument.

 Rao and Ahmed had a heated exchange for over an hour and a half, after which board chairman H.M. Usman announced he would give his verdict on June 25.

 If by any chance the Taj is declared a Sunni waqf property, it would suffer a loss of image. Now it is a Unesco-declared world heritage, said B. Bagchi, assistant director, ASI, in Delhi. 

 In such a scenario, the ASI has the option of appealing in the division bench of the high court and then in the Supreme Court. 

 A Shia leader, Mohsin Rizvi, said: There are already hundreds of monuments which are controlled by the waqf board which remain uncared for, and demanding Taj is a joke. We wanted to stay out of this.

 In the past, a Sangh parivar demand that the Taj be notified a Hindu property because a temple once stood on the site of the monument was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court.

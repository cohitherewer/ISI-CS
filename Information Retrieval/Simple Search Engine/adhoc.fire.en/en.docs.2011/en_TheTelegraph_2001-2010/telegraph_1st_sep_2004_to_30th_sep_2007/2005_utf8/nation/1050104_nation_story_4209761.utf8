 Pilgrim triggers hunt for Assam?s 19 

 M.R. VENKATESH

Chennai, Jan. 3: When the waves struck Kanyakumari, 

Suraj Sharma was waiting with his friends and relatives for a boat that would 

take them to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial.

 That was the last time the 18-year-old from Assam saw the other members of his group.

 As he fled in terror from the gigantic wall of water, Sharma lost track of the others. He returned to Kanyakumari yesterday after a week in a relief camp in Nagercoil, about 20 km away, but could not find the ?Mahindra van? which had brought them to Kanyakumari. He then approached police for help.

 Police sources said Sharma told them he and the others were on a pilgrimage and had arrived in the van early on December 26, the day the tsunami struck. The group was waiting to take a boat from the jetty after seeing the ?sunrise?.

 Based on his statements, Kanyakumari police today informed the state police headquarters in Chennai that 19 members of a group of 20 from Assam were missing. Police sources said they had a ?difficult time? trying to understand what Sharma was saying in his ?broken Hindi?. They finally ?managed? to piece together his story after taking the help of a local tourist guide.

 Sharma also could not give any contact number.

 According to Tamil Nadu police, Sharma said he was a resident of an area under Guwahati?s Paltanbazar Police Station. He also mentioned the word ?Nepali?, which could mean the Nepali Mandir area under the same police station. Though the police quoted Sharma as saying he was from ?Kamakhya district?, what the teenager may have said was he belonged to Kamrup district. It is possible the police heard it as Kamakhya, which is more well known as it is an important pilgrimage centre.

 Assam director-general of police P.V. Sumant, however, said he had no information that any group from the state had gone missing in post-tsunami south India. ?I haven?t heard of any such report,? he said in Guwahati.

 Kanyakumari police said Sharma wanted to go back to Assam, ?hoping the other members of his group are on their way back home?. ?We collected a little money and gave him a certificate saying he is a tsunami-affected person? so that he is allowed to travel free in the Thiruvananthapuram-Guwahati Express today,? the police said.

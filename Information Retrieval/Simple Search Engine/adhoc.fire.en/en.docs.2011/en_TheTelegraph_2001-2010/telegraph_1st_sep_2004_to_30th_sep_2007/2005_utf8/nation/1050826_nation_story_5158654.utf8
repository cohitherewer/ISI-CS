 Focus shifts to rural credit

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: After its success in pushing laws to guarantee right to information and rural employment, the National Advisory Council is about to try and persuade the Centre to focus on another area close to chairperson Sonia Gandhis heart ? rural credit.

 Revival of the micro-credit system and enhancing its flow to benefit small and marginal farmers will top the agenda of the council meeting scheduled for tomorrow, sources said.

 The council, a 12?member body of experts from different fields set up to monitor implementation of the common minimum programme (CMP), believes agriculture was largely excluded from the economic reforms initiated in 1991. As a result, the rural credit infrastructure is facing acute viability pressures.

 One commitment of the CMP was to nurse back to health the rural cooperative credit system. The UPA government will ensure that the flow of rural credit is doubled in the next three years and the coverage of small and marginal farmers by institutional lending is expanded substantially, the document said.

 It also promised to review the delivery system for rural credit and bring a constitutional amendment to ensure cooperatives can function democratically and autonomously.

 The Centres target is to double agricultural credit from Rs 80,000 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 160,000 crore by 2006-07.

 Council sources, however, admitted this is easier said than done. A 2004 study by Assocham of the period between 1992 and 2003 said an important reason for the farm sector recording negative growth in 2002-03 was a sharp fall in rural credit. From 15.7 per cent in 1992, it dropped to 11.8 per cent in 2002. 

 Not only did the decline hit the performance of the farm sector, it also increased the apathy of institutional financing towards farmers.

 The Assocham study revealed that while banks received deposits exceeding Rs 100,000 crore from the farming sector over the decade covered, the credit extended to farmers did not touch even Rs 50,000 crore. 

 In 1992, the number of farmers benefiting from institutional financing made available by state governments was a little over Rs 2.7 crore. It fell to under Rs 2 crore in 2002.

 Other than rural credit, the council meeting tomorrow is likely to discuss the regeneration of wastelands and a rehabilitation policy for tribals displaced by the construction of dams, etc.

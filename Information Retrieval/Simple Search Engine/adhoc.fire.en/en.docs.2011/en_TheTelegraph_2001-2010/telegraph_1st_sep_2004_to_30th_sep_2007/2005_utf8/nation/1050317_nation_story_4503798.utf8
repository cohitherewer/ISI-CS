 Pilot retirement age raised

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 16: Faced with a severe shortage of trained pilots, the directorate general of civil aviation today raised the retirement age for pilots by a year.

 The DGCA said in a press release: ?With sudden growth in the aviation sector, the country is facing an acute shortage of experienced commercial pilots. To overcome the present shortage, the decision to permit professional pilots up to the age of 61 years has been taken.?

 ?A surge in growth in the Asia-Pacific region quickly absorbs whatever supply there is. Foremost of the industry?s concerns is the issue of human resources,? said aviation analyst Kapil Kaul.

 Industry studies indicate there is likely to be a huge skill shortage, notably of flight crew and maintenance engineers. The growth surge coincides with an ageing industry population, where the average age of licensed aircraft engineers is mid fifty and that of professional pilots is late forty. 

 Just as many of these skilled professionals approach retirement, most industry sectors are under strict cost constraints. As a consequence, intake of apprentices in both civil and military aviation have come down to an all time low. 

 A report released by the Australia-based Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation said: ?As several hundred million consumers in the region reach economic thresholds which give them access to air travel, the demand for airline expansion is quickly creating immense resource pressures.?

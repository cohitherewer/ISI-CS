 America turns cleric back

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 26: Kalbe Sadiq, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board vice-president, was stopped by US immigration authorities in Chicago airport on March 17 and interrogated for 36 hours before being deported to London, his nephew said.

 The Shia cleric had landed in Chicago from London.

 Early this week, the US has denied visa to Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.

 Kalbe Sadiq possesses a US visa, his nephew Kalbe Jawar claimed. He has been visiting America for the past 10 years, according to family sources.

 Furious over the US move, Shias hit the streets here and demonstrated after Friday prayers. In a special khutwa (sermon) passed yesterday, Shia leaders assailed the US government for humiliating the senior cleric. Leading Shia clerics asked the Centre to take up the issue with the US ambassador in Delhi. 

 ?His detention and gruelling interrogation were an insult to Muslim clerics across the globe and specially to India,? Jawar said.

 The Shia leaders admitted that Kalbe Sadiq?s humiliation could be linked to their demonstration in Delhi last year to protest US bombing of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq. 

 ?But this kind of demonstration had been held in US, too, by Muslims. So why didn?t the authorities drive out those Muslims from the US?? Jawar asked.

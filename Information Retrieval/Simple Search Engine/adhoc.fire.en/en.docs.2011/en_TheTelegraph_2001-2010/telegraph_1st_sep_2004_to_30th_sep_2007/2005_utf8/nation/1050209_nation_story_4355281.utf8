 Cong finds ally in BSP

 Mayavati: Like minds

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Congress and Mayavati are thinking alike about the Uttar Pradesh government amid speculations that the former might consider a Goa-like action in the state after the ongoing Assembly polls.

 ?The interests of the Congress and the BSP are converging in UP,? state Congress chief Salman Khursheed said here today, hours after the BSP chief iterated in Lucknow her demand for the Mulayam Singh Yadav government?s dismissal and imposition of President?s rule by March 20.

 Khursheed?s virtual announcement of a front with the BSP against the Samajwadi Party regime is being considered significant as the Congress leadership is banking on favourable results from the Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana polls to bolster its anti-Mulayam Singh plans. The party is understood to be keenly awaiting a favourable court verdict on a petition seeking the disqualification of 40 BSP MLAs who defected to the Samajwadi Party 16 months ago, ?which will reduce the Mulayam Singh government to a minority?, an AICC functionary said.

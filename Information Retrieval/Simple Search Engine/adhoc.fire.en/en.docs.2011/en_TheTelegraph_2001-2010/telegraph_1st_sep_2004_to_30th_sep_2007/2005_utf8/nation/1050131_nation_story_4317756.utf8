 Activist held in goon lynch case

 Nagpur (PTI): A city-based social activist 

 has been arrested in connection with the lynching of a goon, 

 Akku Yadav, in a court here in 2004.

 Usha Madhukar Narayane, 35, was arrested by state CID sleuths from her residence at Kasturba Nagar on Saturday and produced before a first class judicial magistrate, who remanded her in police custody.

 Narayane was wanted for her alleged involvement in eliminating Yadav, who was killed in a court chamber on August 13, 2004, by a mob, police said.

 The police had seized ladies? footwear and pieces of broken bangles and recorded footprints and fingerprints from the spot. They had sought Narayane?s custody to match those with hers. Narayane?s brother-in-law, a city lawyer, is also an accused in the case.

 With this arrest, a total of 14 persons have been arrested in the case. While five women taken into custody immediately after the incident were later released on bail, five youths are on judicial remand and lodged in central jail.

 Drug licence bar order

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 directed drug authorities not to issue or renew licences 

 for running chemist shops in residential areas in the national 

 capital as it violated building by-laws and citizens? right 

 to decent living.

 ?Henceforth, the drug authorities, before issuing or renewing a licence to run a chemist shop, shall also ensure that the area where the shop is intended (to be run) is not residential and is meant for commercial use,? a bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justices K. Sikri and B.D. Ahmed said, pulling up the authorities for lapse on their part.

 The bench directed the Delhi Development Authority to initiate appropriate action under the provisions of the Delhi Development Act against certain chemist shops being run in residential areas, pointed out by petitioners.

 The order came on a petition filed by Joginder Kumar Singhla and some other Delhi-based chemists seeking direction to the authorities not to issue drug licences for sale and manufacture of drugs on residential premises and grant licences for the same only in commercial areas. ?The manner in which such large-scale violations have continued leaves no doubt that it is not possible without the connivance of those who are required to ensure compliance of the law, and reasons are obvious,? the bench said.

 of Madras High Court has granted bail to a person who allegedly

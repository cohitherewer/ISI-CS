 No salve for Uma

 RASHEED KIDWAI 

 Advani: Backing Gaur

 Bhopal, May 8: BJP president L.K. Advanis visit to Madhya Pradesh has failed to resolve the leadership crisis in the state. 

 When the BJP chief addressed a tribal development meet in Mandla, Uma Bharti, who was in the nearby jungles of Amarkantak, stayed away.

 Asked about Umas standing in the party, Advani said: ?She is a BJP karyakarta (worker).? 

 Responding to a query on Umas future role, Advani took a dig at the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister. ?It is an internal matter of the party and I would not like to communicate it through the media. In fact, this has been my complaint that some leaders talk through the media, which is grossly wrong. At least I should not make that mistake.?

 Umas recent public pronouncements, ranging from her criticism of the BJP chief for not assigning her work to declaring herself ?Arjun? who aims to cleanse the party of evil, seem to have upset Advani.

 Her supporters had hoped Advani would signal Umas return to active politics. But the party president backed Babulal Gaur, saying he ?will remain the chief minister? and ?he is doing good work?. 

 The praise for Gaur is bad news for the dozen-odd BJP MLAs and ministers loyal to Uma. The chief minister has already hinted at a reshuffle of his council and could drop some ministers. In the coming week, the state BJP is likely to get a new chief. The party leadership has zeroed in on general secretary Shivraj Singh Chauhan for the post. 

 It appears the exercise is aimed at thwarting the sadhvis influence in the state. Known to be a vocal Uma critic, Chauhan is in the same age group as the former chief minister and his rise as state unit chief could further marginalise her. He is also considered to be close to Pramod Mahajan, a leader Uma loves to hate. 

 Insiders said the announcement would be made in a couple of days and it would trigger a fresh round of political realignments. 

 Chauhans rise will have a bearing on Gaur, too, who has been banking on a troika consisting of him, current state chief Kailash Joshi and its organisational secretary Kaptan Singh Solanki. Joshis exit is bound to change equations.

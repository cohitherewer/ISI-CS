 Model or no, triple talaq lives

 - Youth breaks marriage with 3 dreaded words

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, May 4: The young man stepped back, then spun on his heels. Then he uttered the three dreaded words.

 ?Talaq, talaq, talaq.?

 As Shahana Khatoon turned pale, Pappu Khan, her husband of four years, stormed out.

 The instant divorce that ended the four-year-old marriage yesterday, less than hundred hours after the All India Muslim Personal Law Board approved a model nikaahnama to bury the feared triple talaq, has underlined the difficulties reformers face in taking the message to the grassroots.

 How tough the challenge is was clear from the response of Hafiz Abdul Salam, the cleric in Okra, the village in Lakhimpur-Kheri district, 89 km from here, where the incident took place. Told about the talaq, he said it was perfectly in order and advised the deserted 19-year-old to go for three months? iddat (separation from her husband).

 Zafaryab Jilani, a member of the Muslim law board, said it was the responsibility of community leaders to discourage such instant divorces but added that a mammoth army of social workers was needed to spread awareness. 

 ?Now that the talaq has been announced, the woman has to go to Darool Quaza, the local shariat court, for payment of alimony,? he said.

 Pappu, a small trader, and Shahana had tied the knot in 2001. ?When the marriage took place there was no nikaahnama around. There were a few local witnesses,? said Mehboob, Shahana?s father.

 Shahana gave birth to a daughter and for two years, the couple lived happily. The strains began to show since last year when Pappu began pressing for dowry.

 ?I was trying to persuade him to change his mind, but he would not listen. Yesterday, he pronounced the triple talaq and disappeared,? said Shahana, who now has to fend for both herself and her daughter.

 The break-up, barely a few metres from Gola Kotwali police station, left station-in-charge Ram Sagar Rakesh stunned. 

 Rakesh, who was trying to save the marriage after Shahana sought police help as her husband was harassing her family with demands of a motorcycle and other gifts, said Pappu was muttering abuses at his wife. ?Then he stepped back, turned to his wife and uttered the triple talaq.?

 As news of yesterday?s triple talaq spread, members of the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board said the model nikaahnama approved recently in Bhopal was ineffective. 

 Former president Shaista Ambar called it a ?dua ki kitab?, a book for begging mercy, and said women would have to fight to ensure rigid adherence to tuhar, a month-long exercise to reconcile the couple during which announcement of triple talaq is illegal.

 The women?s body is planning to bring out another nikaahnama. ?It needs to be given much more legal teeth,? said general secretary Parveen Abdi.

 ?But first there should be unity among various bodies to fight the issue,? said Aslam Jamshedpuri, a professor of Islamic studies in Chaudhary Charan Singh University. ?Or women like Shahana would continue to suffer.?

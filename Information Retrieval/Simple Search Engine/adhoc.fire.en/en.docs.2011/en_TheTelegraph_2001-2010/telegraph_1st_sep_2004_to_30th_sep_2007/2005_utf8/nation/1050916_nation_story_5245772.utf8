 Glare on bribes for loans

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 15: Four out of seven (57 per cent) of those who receive rural credit at rates meant for the poor in Andhra Pradesh live above the poverty line. In Uttar Pradesh, the figure is 27 per cent.

 The percentage of the loan that must be paid to officials as bribe ranges from 8 per cent to 42 per cent in both states.

 These are some of facts thrown up by a World Bank study, on the efficacy of micro-finance in resolving rural poverty, carried out in the two states. Micro-finance has picked up in both states despite several lacunae, mostly because of political will to promote employment in villages, said World Bank economist Priya Bose as she released the study, India rural finance: access survey 2003.

 Bose said more and more rural households in these states are getting debt-ridden. In Andhra Pradesh, rural indebtedness has shot up from 9.8 per cent in 1981 to 28.9 per cent (in 2005); in Uttar Pradesh, this has risen from 6.3 per cent to 22.6 per cent.

 Bose said commercial banks play a major role in the formal credit delivery system in Andhra Pradesh. In the informal sector, moneylenders account for 56 per cent.

 Most of the credit is spent on family emergencies (29 per cent), goes towards social expenditure (19 per cent) or is invested in land and buildings (13 per cent).

 Bose said self-help groups (SHGs) have become the latest providers of finance to the rural poor through the SHG-bank linkage programme.

 Nearly one million SHGs were linked with 16 million deposit accounts and about 6 million active loan accounts in south India, she said.

 However, the lending rates of even the micro-finance institutions (MFIs) and SHGs had reached 14 per cent, defeating the objective of providing cheaper credit to the rural poor.

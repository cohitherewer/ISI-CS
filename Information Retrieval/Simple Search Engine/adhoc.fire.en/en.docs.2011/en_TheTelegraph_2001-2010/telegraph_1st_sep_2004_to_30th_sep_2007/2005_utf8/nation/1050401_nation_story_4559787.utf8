 Branson sells Mumbai dreams 

 - Virgin boss promises the moon for free skies

 Mumbai, March 31: Sir Richard Branson brought Mumbai airport to a standstill today when he stepped out on to the wing of his Airbus 340, with two local models holding clapper boards proclaiming his latest production, ?Mumbai Dreams?.

 One of the women shrieked with delight and embarrassment when he lifted her in his arms as he had been told they do in Hindi films. Two Virgin Atlantic stewardesses were also there, one holding the Union Jack and the other the Indian tricolour.

 On Virgin?s inaugural flight VS350, which left Heathrow last night for Mumbai, he made a brief announcement to journalists and guests who had come with him. ?This is Richard Branson. Welcome on board our historic flight to Mumbai ? or Bombay ? for those who don?t know the difference.?

 The passengers in upper class not only had plenty of good food and champagne and access to allegedly the longest flat beds in the business but also massages in the morning.

 Antics completed at the airport, he proceeded to the Crystal Room at the Taj Mahal Hotel, where over 200 journalists awaited the Branson show. They were not disappointed. 

 By this time, his vivid purple and red kurta, matching the Virgin colours, had been swapped for a cream one.

 Behind the razzmatazz, Branson had a simple message to deliver to the governments of India and Britain, who will meet for another round of bilateral air traffic talks later next month and will probably clear another 21 direct flights in each direction to add to the 40 that have already been agreed.

 It can be summed up as: ?I, Richard Branson, not being entirely of sound mind, according to my friends, do solemnly pledge to hasten an economic revolution in India, bringing in mobile telephones (there will be an announcement in two weeks), another domestic carrier, insurance and health services, health clubs, music and film production. But you must immediately give me a daily flight from London to Mumbai. I have only three at the moment. 

 ?While you are about it, why don?t you free the skies altogether so I can fly as many times as I like and to as many cities as I want? I will make it possible for many poor Indians who have never even travelled by train to fly for the first time in their lives. Above all, I will be surprisingly good for India.?

 Branson explained how in 21 years he had built up a global carrier from nothing. To prove his point and demonstrate he was a serious human being, he had the lights dimmed, loud music played and a 21st birthday cake brought in. 

 A woman journalist asked a question. Branson said he could not see her because the light was in his eyes but he thought her voice sounded nice. 

 He revealed he had wanted to fly to Mumbai for ?many, many years? and had lobbied for 10 years. 

 Mumbai, he observed, was a ?bustling and vibrant city? and home to the ?biggest film industry in the world?. That explained the clapper-board stunt on the aircraft wing.

 Virgin now has a daily flight to Delhi from London but Branson is pushing for all restrictions to be removed. He would then be able to add Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad to his list of destinations.

 As to why he has made India a top priority, he emphasised that India was perhaps the second fastest economy in the world, after China.

 He was keen to venture into Indian domestic air travel but he felt the rules here were ?slightly murky?. 

 Nevertheless, he believed he could put his ?personal millions? into the business but not as an investor on behalf of Virgin. He held out the prospect of the A380, the ?superjumbo?, equipped with a casino, gym and ?private double bedroom? flying to India.

 He had also ventured into space, so that in two years Virgin Galatic hoped to begin operations. This would make space accessible for ordinary human beings. And one day, there would be hotels in space. For now, he would settle for four more direct flights from London to Mumbai.

 Disaster panel on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: The Centre will within days start drafting a national policy on how to tackle calamities like the December 26 tsunami.

 It has set the formation of a National Disaster Management Authority for this week, without waiting for Parliament to pass the Disaster Management Bill.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil has by an executive order already issued directives for creating the authority, which will be headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and have a maximum of nine other members.

 The bill envisages similar authorities at the state and district levels across the country, to be headed by chief ministers and district collectors, respectively.

 Tsunami research

 The Centre is funding research by the Calcutta-based Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre into whether emissions of gases from hot springs can give warnings of imminent earthquakes or tsunamis, reports Reuters.

 Scientists had noticed a dramatic rise in gases coming from deep within the earth at hot springs in eastern India days before the December 26 tsunami.

 We found the levels of deep earth gases like helium shoot up when large plates below the earth put pressure on each other, the chief of the centre, Bikash Sinha, said. (But) we cannot predict when or where the earthquake or tsunami would occur.

 Kalpakkam shield: In two weeks, the Kalpakkam nuclear power facility near Chennai will have in place the countrys first tsunami warning system.

 A Pune-based company will install the indigenously developed tsunami alarm system ? a wireless system that will scan earthquake sites across the globe, the Indira Gandhi Centre For Atomic Research director, Baldev Raj, said.

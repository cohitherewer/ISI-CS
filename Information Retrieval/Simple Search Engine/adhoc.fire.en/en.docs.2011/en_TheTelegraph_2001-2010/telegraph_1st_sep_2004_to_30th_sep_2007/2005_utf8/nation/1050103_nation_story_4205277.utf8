 Indian saviour

 Phuket, Jan. 2 (TNA): An 18-month-old Kazakh baby, apparently unharmed, has been found in Thailand?s Khao Lak resort in the southern Phang-Nga province which has been devastated by the tsunami.

 The baby, discovered floating on a mattress in the sea by an Indian a few days ago, was handed over to the Kazakh ambassador yesterday.

 It was not until yesterday that officials were alerted to the miraculous discovery of the young survivor by the Indian who had been caring for the baby for the past few days, sources said.

 The little one was in good health, they said, adding that both parents of the baby died, but that his elder brother, aged five, survived.

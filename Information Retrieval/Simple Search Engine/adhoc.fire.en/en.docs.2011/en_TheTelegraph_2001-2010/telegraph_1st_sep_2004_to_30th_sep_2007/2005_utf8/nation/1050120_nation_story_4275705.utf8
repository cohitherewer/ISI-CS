 Paswan in loop, hush in Cong

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: In a balancing act, a slighted Congress reached an electoral understanding with Laloo Prasad Yadav?s bete noire and Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan today.

 But anxious not to hype up the simultaneous liaison with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and its arch rival LJP, the Congress did not comment on its poll pact with Paswan officially.

 As the party tried to keep the pact under wraps, Paswan, his two brothers and a few other LJP leaders had detailed talks with senior Congress leaders Arjun Singh, Ahmed Patel, M.L. Fotedar, Mohsina Kidwai and Harikesh Bahadur.

 After the meeting, Paswan said the LJP had decided to withdraw 18 candidates from the February 3 first phase of the Assembly polls in favour of the Congress; the latter has decided to leave four seats for the LJP. The Congress has also decided not to field candidates in two seats held by Paswan?s party.

 Of the 64 constituencies going to polls in the first phase, the Congress wanted to contest 22 seats and the LJP 45.

 Aware of Laloo Prasad?s enmity with Paswan, Congress spokesperson Jayanti Natarajan reacted cautiously to the poll pact. ?On some seats, we have reached an understanding with the RJD and Left parties. For the remaining seats we are in consultation with our UPA (United Progressive Alliance) partners on how best to defeat the communal forces,? she said.

 The Congress has said it would contest 80 of the 243 seats. In keeping with its understanding with the RJD, the Congress will not field candidates against its sitting MLAs. Elsewhere, it will either field its own candidates or support those of the LJP.

 Sources said Paswan?s party has broadly agreed not to field candidates against the Congress in the 80 constituencies the latter is contesting. There may be problems in two or three seats, but this will not affect the alliance, they said.

 Paswan said he would campaign for Congress candidates while state-level Congress leaders will canvass for his party. He said talks would be held later with the Congress for the remaining two phases.

 Paswan said his alliance with the Congress would not affect the Congress-RJD ties or the UPA government. Without naming Laloo Prasad, he said: ?Nobody should be under any delusion that the UPA government is running on his finger. I will be in the UPA.?

 Paswan said the coming Bihar elections would teach the ruling party, RJD, a lesson.

 He said he had received feedback that minorities support the Congress-LJP alliance. ?Laloo (Prasad) has now started threatening the Muslims,? he said.

 Reacting to the railway minister?s attempt to use the Godhra interim report to influence Muslim voters, Paswan said the RJD chief never visited Gujarat after the 2002 carnage while he (Paswan) had quit the National Democratic Alliance cabinet in protest. The LJP chief said he visited Gujarat several times to unite Muslims and Hindus, especially Dalits.

 He said the RJD had insulted the Congress by offering just four seats during the Lok Sabha elections and starting negotiations for the Bihar polls by offering a mere 10.

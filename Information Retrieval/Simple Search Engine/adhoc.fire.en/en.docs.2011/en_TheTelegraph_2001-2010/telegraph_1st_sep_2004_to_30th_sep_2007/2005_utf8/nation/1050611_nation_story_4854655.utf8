 Harassed seers set to shuttle

 Chennai: Two days after the hyped homecoming, 

 the Kanchi acharyas have decided to move out again because 

 of police harassment, reports our special correspondent.

 Jayendra and Vijayendra Saraswati, the senior and junior pontiffs of the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt, will now be staying in Kalavai, 45 km away, and return for short periods only when necessary.

 The acharyas returned to a grand welcome on Wednesday, eight months after they had left Kancheepuram and seven months after the senior pontiff was arrested in Andhra Pradesh as prime accused in the murder of temple official Shankar Raman.

 But on Thursday afternoon, the polices special investigating team, probing the murder in which the junior seer is also an accused, arrived at the mutt and questioned the senior acharya about an old land deal.

 To the pontiffs, this was a rude jolt. They have now decided to go back to the mutts ashram at Kalavai, a quiet village in Vellore district where Jayendra Saraswati had been staying after his release on bail in January. The junior pontiff had joined him after his own bail conditions were relaxed.

 The acharyas, who will be leaving on Saturday, will shuttle between the village and the mutt, sources said. 

 Child dies in rail ticket clash

 Lucknow: Two persons, including a three-year-old 

 child, were killed on Friday in a clash between police and 

 passengers at an Uttar Pradesh railway station.

 Senior superintendent of police Piyus Modia said trouble began after the Government Railway Police (GRP) allegedly misbehaved with passengers in course of a ticket-checking drive by a magistrate at Dadri station, about 400 km from here.

 The police said a ticketless traveller fell on the tracks when the GRP chased him. They then pounced on the man and allegedly dragged him along, threatening to open fire. 

 Some passengers came to his rescue and began stoning the railway police. The police were forced to open fire in which the passenger was shot dead and 15 people injured.

 Later, the police opened fire on the platform to control the unruly crowd, resulting in the death of the three-year-old child waiting with her mother for a local train.

 Hundreds of passengers then ransacked the station and set its offices ablaze. 

 Court relief for Salman 

 lMumbai (PTI) Bombay High Court has granted permanent exemption to actor Salman Khan from appearing in a hit-and-run case in which he is accused of killing one person and injuring four.

 Live wire deaths

 Mysore (PTI): Seven villagers, including 

 three women and a child, were electrocuted near Belekere 

 on the Mysore-Mangalore road. A loose live wire fell on 

 the bullock cart in which they were returning from a marriage 

 party. A bullock was also killed while the other escaped. 

 Thursdays downpour and strong winds could have led 

 to the snapped wire, police said.

 Shivaji sword

 London (PTI): An Indian lawyer has 

 presented a petition to Queen Elizabeth seeking return of 

 a 350-year-old sword of Chhatrapati Shivaji to India, saying 

 it is a symbol of the countrys rich cultural heritage. 

 The sword was presented as a gift to the Prince 

 of Wales, Edward VII, during his visit to India in November 

 1875 by the then Maharaja of Kolhapore.

 Pickle trouble

 New Delhi (PTI): After the furore 

 in the UK over presence of banned Sudan red dye in chillies, 

 Canadian authorities have problems with pickle. Canada is 

 understood to have withheld a shipment of mixed vegetable 

 achar made by a Haryana-based company and has asked 

 it to furnish a separate bacteria-free certificate for the 

 vegetable ingredients in the pickle.

 Record mission

 Coimbatore (PTI): In a bid to enter 

 record books, seven teenagers are collecting paper cuttings 

 of events of pre and post independent India. The articles, 

 which appeared in newspapers, magazines and periodicals, 

 were pasted on a 180-metre long roll of paper. The group 

 called Seven Star Friends, all residents of Vairam Street, 

 hope to enter the Guinness or the Limca record books, sources 

 said.

 In an indication of the healthy existence of the endangered species, about 110 sarus cranes engaged in courtship were spotted on the outskirts of Surat. Gujarat has only 1,800 sarus cranes.

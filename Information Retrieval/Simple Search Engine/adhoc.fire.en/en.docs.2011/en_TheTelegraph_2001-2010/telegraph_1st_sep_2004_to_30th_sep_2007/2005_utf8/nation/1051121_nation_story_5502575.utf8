 Pak vows to account for relief

 Islamabad, Nov. 20 (Reuters): Quake-stricken Pakistan heaved a sigh of relief on Sunday after world donors pledged almost $6 billion, and vowed in return to account for every cent as it distributes the aid to survivors of last months huge tremor.

 Pakistan, seen as one of the most corrupt nations in a recent global survey, secured over $3 billion in fresh pledges at a donor conference on Saturday, taking the total to $5.83 billion, after the United Nations complained of a weak initial response.

 It will help change the lives of millions of people stricken by the tragedy, the News said in an editorial on Sunday, having headlined its front-page story: Finally, world conscience shaken and stirred. Hope wins the day.

 The October 8 quake killed more than 73,000, mostly in the remote Himalayan region of Pakistan Kashmir and in North West Frontier Province, and left hundreds of thousands homeless.

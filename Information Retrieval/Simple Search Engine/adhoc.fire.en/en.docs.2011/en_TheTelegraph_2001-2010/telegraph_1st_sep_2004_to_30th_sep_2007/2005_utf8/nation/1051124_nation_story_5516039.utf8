 NDA lines up foreign funds charge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The NDA will move a hold-all adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha tomorrow against the Congress for allegedly receiving money from the CIA, KGB and the Saddam Hussein regime.

 The Opposition hopes the motion, if admitted, will bring into the ambit of discussion the Mitrokhin papers, which purportedly reveal how the Congress and the Left were funded by the KGB in the 1970s, and the Volcker report, which names the Congress and Natwar Singh, now minister without portfolio, as beneficiaries of Iraqs oil-for-food programme.

 A National Democratic Alliance (NDA) meeting chaired by Atal Bihari Vajpayee also decided to press for the resignation of Natwar from the cabinet and of Sonia Gandhi as chairperson of the National Advisory Council. It threatened to stall proceedings in both Houses if the motion was not admitted.

 We will demand an adjournment motion condemning the sale of the country by the Congress party as substantiated by the Moynihan report (which makes the CIA payoff charge), the Mitrokhin papers and the Volcker Committee report, said BJP spokesman V.K. Malhotra.

 Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee told reporters he had no problem with adjournment discussions on the Volcker report on any other important issue. But he would have to look into the demand for a discussion on the Mitrokhin papers.

 It is a book. Whether we can allow a discussion is a point I have to take a decision (on) because anybody can then seek to raise discussions on the basis of allegations in books, Chatterjee said.

 It is learnt the Congress brass had indicated to the Speaker, at a dinner he hosted last Sunday, that there was no need to discuss the Mitrokhin papers. 

 Congress sources warned that if the NDA insisted on the Mitrokhin papers, they would answer in kind by bringing up the embarrassing portions in books such as Seymour Hershs The Price of Power and Vishnu Bhagwats Betrayal of the Defence Forces.

 Hersh, a US journalist, had accused Morarji Desai of accepting a yearly fee of $20,000 from the CIA to be its informer when he was in Indira Gandhis cabinet. Desai later headed the Janata Party government in which Vajpayee and L.K. Advani were ministers.

 Bhagwat was abruptly replaced as navy chief by the former NDA governments defence minister, George Fernandes, because of serious differences. Bhagwats book accuses Fernandes of throwing him out without following due process to bring in his private choice.

 Sources claimed the disclosures by a former RAW official ? that Vajpayee and former Jan Sangh president Balraj Madhok were beneficiaries of KGB largesse ? will also be brought up.

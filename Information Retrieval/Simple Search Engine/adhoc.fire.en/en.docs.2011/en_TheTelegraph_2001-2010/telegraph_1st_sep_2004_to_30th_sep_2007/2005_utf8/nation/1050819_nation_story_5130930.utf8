 Singh: Job promise

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has promised that at least 80 per cent of the vacancies in government jobs reserved for Dalits and tribals will be filled by the end of this year.

 The assurance was given in a two-hour meeting Singh had today with members of the Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes Parliamentary Forum.

 This is the first time since 1977 that a Prime Minister has interacted with the SC/ST forum.

 Sanjaya Baru, the Prime Ministers media adviser, told the media that a special drive will be launched to clear this backlog.

 Some MPs raised the issue of the scrapping of the government quota, including that for the SCs and STs in private educational institutions.

 Singh promised to bring in a bill to restore the reservation quota, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.

 A press release issued by the Prime Ministers media adviser said since education is key to the empowerment of the SCs/STs, Singh told the MPs that market forces will not be able to address the needs and aspirations of the weaker sections of society.

 He added that the government had a role and an obligation to provide access to education and health care and it will have to honour this obligation.

 The press release said the Prime Minister told the forum that the government will engage the services of senior counsel Parasaran to further address the quota issue in private educational institutions.

 Sources said the details of the governments legal response will have to be worked out.

 Some MPs brought up the subject of job reservation in the private sector. 

 The Prime Minister, according to the press release, said he would endeavour to persuade the private sector to accept the logic of affirmative action and quoted him as stating: The government has the obligation to do the right thing. Consensual change leaves behind less social bitterness.

 As part of the endeavour, the Prime Minister told the forum members he was involved in a dialogue with the political parties as well as trade and business leaders.

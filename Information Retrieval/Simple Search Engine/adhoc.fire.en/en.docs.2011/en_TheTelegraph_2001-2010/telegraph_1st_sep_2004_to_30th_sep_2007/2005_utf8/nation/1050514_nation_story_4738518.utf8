 Kathmandu parties turn Left for support

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 13: Major political parties in Nepal, disappointed with Delhis decision to resume military contacts with Kathmandu, have turned to the Left parties ? key allies of the ruling United Progressive Alliance ? to ensure that the Centre continues to push King Gyanendra towards restoring democracy.

 Leaders of the seven mainstream parties in Nepal, who are in Delhi for the past few weeks, today met CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan and his CPM counterpart Prakash Karat separately to register their complaints over Indias decision.

 The Left parties have decided to convene in Delhi a meeting of all democratic forces in favour of the immediate restoration of democracy. The date of the meeting is to be announced shortly, but the move is a clear indicator of the significant role that the Left wishes to play regarding the policy towards Nepal.

 The parties have already announced their decision to hold a massive demonstration in Kathmandu and other places in Nepal on May 27 to protest against King Gyanendra. 

 The Maoists have also openly supported the political parties, which is being seen as a likely turning point in the democratic movement to isolate the palace and its cronies.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other senior colleagues assured the Left leaders at a breakfast meeting yesterday that though India has resumed military contacts with Nepal it has not sent arms to the Royal Nepal Army. Singh also made it clear that in future no heavy artillery will be sent to Nepal.

 The Nepal leaders said during their meetings: The despatch of military supplies from India to Nepal may not have been lethal. But the message it has sent was lethal.

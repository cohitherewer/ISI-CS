The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Taxmen in morning swoop on Tamil stars 

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Rahman

 Chennai, Oct. 26: The income-tax 

 department today raided the houses of composer A.R. Rahman, 

 actor Vikram and other artistes of the Tamil film industry.

 The tax team got cracking at 6 this morning and landed at the homes of actors Vivek, Sneha, Simbu, Trisha and S.J. Surya, apart from Rahman, Vikram and a host of producers and directors. Surya had recently been in the news when he hurled his cellphone at a member of the censor board.

 The authorities were tight-lipped about the raids, which went on till noon and in some cases even later. The stars were quizzed on their sources of income, bank balance, jewellery and property. Several incriminating documents have reportedly been seized from some artistes. 

 There had been a buzz about stars here concealing their real income since a week ago. Those who came under the scanner today have been successful at the box-office in recent months, hinting at a new boom in the star-loaded industry. 

 While Rahman hits the bulls eye every time he lifts his baton, Harris Jayraj, a relatively lesser-known composer, has also tasted success recently. 

 Vikram

 Vikram, who won a National Award for Pithamagan and rave reviews for Anniyan, is the current rage among youths. 

 Giving him company on the popularity charts is Vijay, who has two big films ? Sivakasi and Deepavali ? lined up for release this year. The PMK led by S. Ramadoss had recently gone to town with a poster asking how Vijay could acquire prime property belonging to the state government in Ashok Nagar. 

 Actors like Trisha and Sneha, who have also been making waves in Telugu and Malayalam films, figure among the highest paid artistes in the industry. 

 Producers have been complaining that the sums they pay actors are reaching ludicrous levels, putting them at the mercy of financiers who charge high rates of interest. 

 Hotels frequented by actors Asin and Nayanthara were also raided today. However, the two were not in Chennai. 

 A senior I-T official had given a hint of things to come last week when he said raids on VIP residences have an overall effect on tax evaders.

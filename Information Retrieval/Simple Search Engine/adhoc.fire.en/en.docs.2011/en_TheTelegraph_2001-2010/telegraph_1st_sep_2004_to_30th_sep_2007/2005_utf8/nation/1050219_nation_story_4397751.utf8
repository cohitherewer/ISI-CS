 ?Taint? case goes to House

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 18: The Centre today shifted the Supreme Court?s glare on ?tainted ministers?, promising to hold a debate in Parliament to determine whether such persons deserve to be ministers.

 A three-judge bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde, S.B. Sinha and A.K. Mathur dismissed a petition challenging the induction of persons with criminal record into the cabinet.

 The petition had been filed last year by Manoj Narula, who contended that such induction ?breached the terms of oath? given in Schedule III of the Constitution.

 The court had observed that the matter had been debated in the House. 

 An amended PIL pointed out that no such discussion had taken place, prompting the court to take up the matter.

 The petitioner?s counsel, Anil Kumar Jha, said the matter could again be brought before the court if there is no debate and if Parliament fails to come to a conclusion.

 The PIL named Laloo Prasad Yadav, Jai Prakash Yadav, M.A.A. Fatmi, Shibu Soren and Mohammad Taslimuddin among others and said the ministers, who are required to carry out important constitutional duties, should be people of integrity.

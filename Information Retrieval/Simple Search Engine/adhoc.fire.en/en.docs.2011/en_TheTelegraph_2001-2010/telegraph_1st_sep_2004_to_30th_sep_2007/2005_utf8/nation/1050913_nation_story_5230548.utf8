 Laloo in Rabri climbdown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rabri Devi: For ally sake

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav has agreed not to project Rabri Devi as the chief ministerial candidate for the Bihar Assembly elections, in a pre-poll concession to his alliance partners ? the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and the CPM.

 The railway ministers concession is being seen as part of a tactic to take the sting out of United Progressive Alliance rival and Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswans sustained campaign against him. Paswan has claimed that Laloo Prasad is not interested in projecting a Muslim as the chief ministerial candidate despite the communitys strong backing for the RJD in the past.

 Lalooji has already made a statement in this regard (about not projecting a chief ministerial candidate before the elections). We will not project anyone as chief minister. The chief ministerial candidate will be decided only after we get a majority. Lalooji has agreed to this, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh said. 

 Singh, who is in the forefront of chalking out the Congresss strategy for the Bihar polls, is entertaining hopes that Laloo Prasads climbdown on Rabri Devis candidature could soften up Paswans opposition to joining the Bihar alliance of which the RJD will be the leading partner.

 I will meet him (Paswan) when he comes here on September 17. Though Paswan has said no to joining the alliance (in Bihar), we are still hoping that he will come on board, the Congress leader said. 

 However, Singh is realistic enough to accept that it may not happen and has presumed that the poll alliance in the state would include only the Congress, the NCP and the CPM as junior partners.

 Singh met NCP leader Tariq Anwar and CPM leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury today. The meeting assumed significance as the three junior partners are seeking to adopt a common strategy to bargain with Laloo Prasad over seat-sharing.

 The seat-sharing talks were preliminary in nature. We hope to finalise an agreement before the first poll notification on September 23, Singh said after his discussions.

 Orissa DGP eyes new chapter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 9: Orissa director-general of police Bipin Bihari Mishra will relinquish his post four months before his term is scheduled to expire on June 29.

 Mishra, who took over as the state police chief in July last year, is understood to have taken this decision after being offered the chairman?s post in the state Staff Selection Commission (SSC). He is likely to replace A.A. Sayed as the new SSC chief in February.

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has reportedly cleared Mishra?s name and the DGP too has given his consent. 

 The official declaration, though, would be made in a month?s time, sources said.

 Additional director-general (CID) Suchit Das, a 1971 batch IPS officer, is expected to become the next state DGP.

 Mishra, a 1967 batch officer of the Orissa cadre, has earlier worked as the director-general of CISF and special secretary in the home ministry.

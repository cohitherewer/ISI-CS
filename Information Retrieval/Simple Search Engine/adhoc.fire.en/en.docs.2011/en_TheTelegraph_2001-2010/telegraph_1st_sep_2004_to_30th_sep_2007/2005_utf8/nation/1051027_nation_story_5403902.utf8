 Outsource helps US lobbyist land India job

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Oct. 26: Pioneering effort by an American lobbying firm to outsource legal work to India helped Venable LLP to bag Indias second lobbying contract in the face of stiff competition from a sea of rivals with connections in the Democratic Party.

 The contract, whose value will only be disclosed when Venable files the mandatory legal papers with the US department of justice, is the second lobbying firm to be hired by the Indian embassy here in the race to push through Indias nuclear deal with the Bush administration on Capitol Hill.

 The firm is an undisputed leader in lobbying among Democrats, who are more vocal than Republicans in opposing the Indo-US nuclear deal announced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President George W. Bush here on July 18.

 One of Venables partners is Birch Bayh, who was a senator from Indiana for 18 years from 1962. A major consideration behind Indias decision to hire Venable is his son, Evan Bayh, who inherited the fathers senate seat in 1998.

 Evan Bayh is often mentioned as a likely presidential candidate of the Democratic Party in 2008. He was earlier governor of Indiana and has steadily risen on the US political scene.

 Venable has its crop of Republicans too. Another of its partners, Asa Hutchinson, is a three-time Republican Congressman from Arkansas, who led the Drug Enforcement Administration and was until recently under-secretary of homeland security in the Bush administration.

 The hiring of Venable is also reflection of a belated recognition by New Delhi that it probably made a mistake in September in hiring a lobbyist, the Republican leaning firm, Barbour, Griffith amp; Rogers.

 This firm was hired at an annual fee of $700,000, primarily because Robert Blackwill, former US ambassador to India, is heading its international business, but New Delhi is finding out to its cost that Blackwill is among the most unpopular figures in the public arena in this city.

 Several recent visitors from India to Washington, including leading political figures, have been dismayed by the negative reaction on Capitol Hill and in key branches of the Bush administration that the very mention of Blackwills name evokes here.

 When word was out that India was looking for a second lobbying firm with ties to Democrats, there was a flood of lobbying here and in New Delhi to bag the contract.

 Venable stole a march over others when it strategically publicised its pioneering efforts to outsource legal work to India.

 The company began outsourcing when it tied up with Indian legal firms to draft patent applications for its clients and is now looking at expanding that practice into new areas.

 About 1,300 Indian lawyers now provide legal services for their American counterparts, generating about $52 million in revenue, according to published reports here.

 Venable took outsourcing to new heights despite opposition from American lawyers and some clients that sending legal work to India risked compromising on the need for privacy.

 The companys determination to persevere with its outsourcing ? which has obvious benefits for Venable ? has now resulted in the prestigious India contract.

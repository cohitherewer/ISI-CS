 PM neighbour gesture

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: After refusing to legitimise the royal coup in Nepal, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh indicated that India had not shut the door on its neighbour.

 A PMO blueprint, which set out the policy thrust areas for the various ministries and departments, spoke of a ?proactive engagement? with the neighbours to ?improve border management? with a focus on ?related infrastructure development?.

 According to the charter, the foreign ministry has been advised to explore ?lines of credit with a view to creating opportunities for Indian business and improving access to needed raw material, including energy sources?. 

 The defence ministry was asked to streamline the procurement procedure in order to expedite acquisitions while improving transparency and accountability. 

 The home ministry was set a six-month deadline by the PMO to tackle ?Naxalism/Left-wing extremism?. 

 The ministry was also tasked to ?tackle terrorism, militancy and insurgency in the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir as an urgent national priority?. However, it was advised to implement a Jammu and Kashmir reconstruction plan.

 Proposals were mooted to revive the defunct National Integration Council ? which was constituted in the Ayodhya era ? and enact a model comprehensive law to fight communal violence.

 In the social sector, Singh outlined plans to table a bill on education as a fundamental right, ensure nationwide coverage of the mid-day meal programme, establish a national commission on education and ensure legal equality for women in all legislation.

 The PMO charter pledged to ?address the problems of minorities in a comprehensive manner?. 

 For starters, it will commission a study by an institute set up by former Chief Justice A.M. Ahmadi to come up with ?tangible? suggestions within the next six months. 

 His charter also promised to promote technical and ?modern? education among minorities.

 Realising that a pre-poll commitment on quotas in the private sector was not received too well by industry and opinion-makers, the PMO?s ?manifesto? merely spoke of ?promoting employment opportunities for scheduled castes?.

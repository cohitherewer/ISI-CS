 Amnesty cry for Taslima 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Irene Khan

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: The finger-wagging woman at the dais has a fine mop of curly hair that frames her face with a dark halo and she is in a state of controlled agitation. Her audience at the press conference in the Foreign Correspondents Club of South Asia here this week is caught between watching her and listening to her.

 In the melancholic world of human rights activism, Irene Zubaida Khan, 48, is as attractive as democracy on Kathmandu?s Darbar Marg: even the king claims he wants it. 

 She has just returned from a 50-minute meeting with the King of Narayanhiti Palace that sits atop that wide promenade in the Nepalese capital. Before that Irene and her team were on a week?s survey of the human rights situation in the Himalayan kingdom.

 In South Asia, the spunky secretary-general of the global human rights outfit, Amnesty International, is cut out to be a heroine. She is Bangladeshi, a woman and a Muslim, the first Asian to hold the chair. She has tired of that description because its so cliched. But she has also made human rights activism fashionable just when it was getting passe.

 This morning, she was on her way to Calcutta, enroute Dhaka, for a homecoming.

 She stops by, to talk about another Bangladeshi, woman, Muslim, now in Calcutta, Taslima Nasreen. ?If she (Nasreen) feels it is not safe for her to return to Bangladesh, I hope the government of India will give her protection. In Amnesty International, we feel that if a person wants protection in another country, sanctuary must be given. I understand that governments are not obliged to give citizenship.?

 Irene articulates the human rights campaign she heads with an alacrity that has come out of an understanding of law, a reputation of a traveller to global hotspots and her experience of 21 years in the UN High Commission for Refugees. For three years she headed the UNHCR mission here.

 Above all, Irene is a professional human rights activist. A rare breed in a sense because concern for human rights is mostly borne of politics or plain and simple fellow feeling.

 ?The lines between the personal and the professional blur in my case. I have worked in the field for nearly a quarter of a century now. I suppose it demands tolerance in both personal and professional life,? she reflects.

 London-based Irene has been away from Bangladesh ? ?I do not hold any other passport other than the Bangladeshi? ? since she moved from one civil war situation at home to another in Northern Ireland in 1973. She is married to a German economist, Josef Auwer and has a daughter.

 Irene took over as the head of Amnesty International in August 2001, and a month later there was 9/11 and the human rights movement ceased to be fashionable. Four years and much globetrotting later, she is altering perceptions again.

 Few articulate the human rights position with as much clarity: ?My profession is tough but it is also very fulfilling. I think the hardest thing is that the people with whom I am speaking are very passionate about their circumstances. Yes, it is important to be clinical and dispassionate. But I feel both sides are concerned. When I am in Ramallah, I sympathise as much with the woman in Jenin or the woman in Tel Aviv. Human rights violations are not committed against the other side but against a mother, a sister, a brother, a son.?

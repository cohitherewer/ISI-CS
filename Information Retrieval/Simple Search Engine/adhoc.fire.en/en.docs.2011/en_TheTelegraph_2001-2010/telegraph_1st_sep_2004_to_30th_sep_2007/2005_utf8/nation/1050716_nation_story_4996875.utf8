 College seat quota

 New Delhi, July 15: The Supreme Court today approved an agreement between the Karnataka government and private professional colleges, fixing the governments and the managements quota of seats for the academic year 2005-06, reports our legal correspondent.

 The order that may pave the way for settling admission disputes across the country is an interim arrangement, a division bench said. The main ruling will come from a seven-judge Constitution bench, the court added.

 The government-management ratio for this academic year will be 65:35 in engineering colleges and 50:50 in medical and dental colleges, as agreed in the joint memo signed by the state government and the Association of Private Medical and Engineering Colleges.

 The memo, which was filed in the court today, has also fixed the fee for the government and management seats in engineering, medical and dental courses. It said private management in colleges would ensure transparent, fair and merit-based admissions.

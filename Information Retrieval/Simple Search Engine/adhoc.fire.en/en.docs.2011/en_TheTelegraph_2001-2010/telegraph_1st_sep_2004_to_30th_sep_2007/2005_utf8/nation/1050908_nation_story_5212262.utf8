 Centre seal on new school syllabus

 New Delhi, Sept. 7 (PTI): The framework for a new school curriculum got the seal of the Central Advisory Board of Education, which ended a two-day meeting amid a boycott by education ministers of BJP-ruled states.

 Human resource development minister Arjun Singh said the new exercise will be flawless.

 With a monitoring committee to look into the suggestions made by members and preparation of syllabus and writing of textbooks in place, I dont think anything will go awry, the Congress leader said after the framework was adopted at the end of the meeting.

 We will see to it that the textbooks that come out will not have any flaws, he added.

 Yesterday, BJP education ministers had walked out alleging that the framework was dismissive of Indias past.

 Singh said the second stage of preparing the syllabus and textbooks would be the very very difficult part, but all suggestions made by members would be part of the new framework. I am very sad this simple language was not understood by some who preferred to walk out for the two lines (in the press) which will give them glory, he added, hitting out at the BJP ministers.

 Singh said the monitoring committee, which will have members from the central advisory board, the NCERT and officials from state governments, would ensure that all suggestions of members are incorporated in the syllabus and ultimately in textbooks.

 Asserting that he would not be part of the efforts to prepare the syllabus, Singh said there is enough work for all those who want to participate. But those who do not want to participate, well let them take their own way. We cannot help it.

 Yes. I have to accept that there is a constitutional responsibility on my shoulders which I cannot shrug off even if I want to, he said, adding that it would be his responsibility to see that the framework is translated into syllabus and textbooks.

 Voicing a note of dissent, social activist Teesta Setalvad said the framework is a confused document that fails to live up to the historic mandate entrusted to it.

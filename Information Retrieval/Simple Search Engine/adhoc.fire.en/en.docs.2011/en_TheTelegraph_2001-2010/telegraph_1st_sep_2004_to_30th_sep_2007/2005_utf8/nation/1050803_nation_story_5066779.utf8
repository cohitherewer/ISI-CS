 Pranab allays US pact fears

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mukherjee

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: Indias new defence treaty with the US will enable greater trade in military equipment and allow for deployment of Indian troops only if it is in the national interest, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Parliament today.

 Making a suo motu statement, Mukherjee said concerns that Delhi had committed to deploy troops in Iraq under a US-led coalition are unjustified. 

 The statement comes in the wake of apprehensions from both the Left and the BJP that the pact ? New Framework for the US-India Defence Relationship ? signed in Washington in June would compromise Indias security policies.

 Concerns expressed in Parliament and in the press on the implications of the document have included apprehensions that it commits India to deploying troops in support of US-led coalition operations in Iraq and possibly elsewhere, that it adopts vocabulary and language, and therefore, the world view of the United States, and that it promotes US security interests and not ours, and therefore, compromises our security. None of these apprehensions are justified, he said.

 Mukherjee said the pact more than anything else, signals the USs willingness to enhance defence cooperation with India and strengthen our defence capabilities.

 It was in Delhis interest to ensure that this change of attitude in Washington is exploited to Indias advantage. It is an enabling document that provides a framework within which specific cooperation can take place. It is up to us how we develop this. This will not be dictated to us. It will be decided by mutual agreement.

 Mukherjee said the interpretation that shared interests involving the US would make Indias policies subservient to Washingtons reflects a lack of self-confidence in ourselves. He said: We have the self-confidence that we will be able to recognise and resist anything that is not in our national interest, not confuse US interests with ours, or subordinate our interests to US interests.

 The agreement identifies global security threats, including the dangers of violent religious extremism and will promote co-operation with the US to enhance Indias response capabilities and increase co-operation in advanced and sensitive technologies. India, he said, was interested in the security of sea lanes and this is reflected in the document. 

 To promote co-operation, the agreement establishes a Defence Procurement and Production Group under the existing (secretary-level) India-US Defence Policy Group. The body will promote defence trade, production and technology collaboration. It also provides for a dialogue on international security issues and co-operation with the international community to promote regional and global stability through co-operative actions in mutual interest, Mukherjee said.

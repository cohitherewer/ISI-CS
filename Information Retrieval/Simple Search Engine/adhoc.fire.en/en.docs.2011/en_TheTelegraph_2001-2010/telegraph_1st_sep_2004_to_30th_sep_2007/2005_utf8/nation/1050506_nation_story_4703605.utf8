 Mittal hope for Ranchi

 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA

 Ranchi, May 5: Jharkhand could soon shine on the glittering Mittal map. 

 A team from Mittal Steel today reached Ranchi and announced it was interested in setting up a new greenfield project in the state. 

 The team led by Sudhir Maheshwari, executive vice-president, corporate finance, arrived from London today. 

 The visit comes a day after chief minister Arjun Munda claimed to have received an invitation from Calcutta-born baron Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, the owner of the largest steel empire in the world, to a meeting in London. 

 Maheshwari, who met mines minister Madhu Koda this evening, said the team would make a detailed presentation tomorrow where the companys roadmap for Jharkhand would be laid out. ?Everything will become clear after that.?

 Tomorrow, Mittals representatives will hold meetings with Munda and chief secretary P.P. Sharma. They are also likely to visit the places that have rich iron ore reserves. 

 The emissary from the steel czar said though his company is yet to decide on the quantum of investment, money would not be a stumbling block. 

 Mittal Steel, Maheshwari said, chose the state because of its rich mineral reserves. ?We have worked in the most backward areas of the world. Jharkhand is a developed place. We dont need to worry much about anything here.?

 Maheshwari is being accompanied by Mittal Steels mining head M.P. Singh and consultant P.R. Tripathi. Singh, who, too, is based in London, and Tripathi are both graduates of Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad. Maheshwari passed out from Calcutta.

 Koda informed the team that Jharkhands iron ore reserves exceeded 3,758 million tonnes and the state had all the necessary infrastructure for hassle-free mining.

 Singh said four states had approached his company and Mittal, during his last trip to India, had asked his executives to look into the proposals. ?But we chose Jharkhand because it has the necessary infrastructure.?

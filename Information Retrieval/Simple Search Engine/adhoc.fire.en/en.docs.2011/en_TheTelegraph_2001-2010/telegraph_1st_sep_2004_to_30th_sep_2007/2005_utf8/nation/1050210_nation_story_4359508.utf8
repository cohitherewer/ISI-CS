 Sikh riots report in, finally

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: Justice G.T. Nanavati today handed in his report on the inquiry into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots but refused to share the findings.

 The retired Supreme Court judge, who was asked to probe the riots by the earlier Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, submitted the about 200-page report in two volumes in a sealed cover to Union home minister Shivraj Patil.

 The first volume is believed to be on the ?events during October 31-November 3, 1984,? when the riots took place and the second appeared to consist of statements and records of evidence submitted to and collected by the one-man commission.

 An estimated 3,000 Sikhs died in the riots that followed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi?s assassination.

 ?I have submitted my report and now it is for the government to make it public and take action on the basis of the recommendations,? Justice Nanavati said to repeated questions by mediapersons.

 An official brief said the report focuses on the ?causes and course of the criminal violence and riots targeting members of the Sikh community which took place in the national capital territory of Delhi and other parts of the country on October 31, 1984, (the day of assassination of Indira Gandhi) and thereafter?.

 It also contains the commission?s findings on ?whether these heinous crimes could have been averted and whether there were any lapses or dereliction of duty in this regard on the part of any of the responsible authorities?.

 The statement of the late Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao figures prominently as he was the Union home minister when the riots broke out. Rao had deposed before the commission.

 Looking ahead, the report also details the ?administrative measures to be taken to deal with such riots?.

 Although the commission?s term ended on January 31, the report could not be submitted on that day because the home minister was away in the Northeast.

 The Nanavati commission is the second judicial body to probe the events that led to violence against the Sikh community.

 Prominent Congress leaders Vasant Sathe, Kamal Nath, Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar, besides Rao, deposed before the commission.

 Former Congress Union minister H.K.L. Bhagat, who faced accusations of leading a mob of rioters, did not appear before the commission on ?health grounds?. An affidavit filed on his behalf by his son said Bhagat was suffering from ?mental illness? and ?memory lapses?.

 The 70-year-old judge, who is also probing the Gujarat riots under the same Commissions of Inquiry Act, declined to comment on the findings amid media reports that he had given a ?clean chit? to the Congress, accused of covertly engineering and supporting the anti-Sikh riots.

 In September 2004, Justice Nanavati had gone public with his preliminary findings that pointed fingers at then Congress MP Sajjan Kumar and Bhagat. 

 The commission was set up on May 8, 2000, following complaints by the Sikh community that the previous Justice Ranganath commission report did not unravel the entire truth behind the riots.

 It was initially given six months to submit its report but was later granted 10 extensions, a history of sorts. The last extension expired on January 31, with the government refusing the commission?s request for 10 more days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Kingmaker left high and dry

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 23: The day after the Bihar poll results were declared, most newspapers had the same picture on their front page. It showed Ram Vilas Paswan in a striped T-shirt and jeans, with his wife and a plateful of laddoos, weighed down by garlands and waited on by a mass of hangers-on.

 Though touted by the media as the man to watch out for as he had chopper-hopped across the state with one journalist or the other before the polls, the politicos had not given him much of a chance. 

 His bitter rival, Laloo Prasad Yadav, gave him the moniker Dalit Kumar, punning on actor Dilip Kumars name. In Laloo Prasads view that reflected what Paswan really was: a showman without substance. 

 The Congress was tentative about his influence over the Dalits and Muslims and blew hot and cold towards him through the polls. The BJP and Janata Dal (United) were sceptical about the leader who changed his partner with every election. 

 But when his Lok Janshakti Party returned 29 MLAs, Paswan was the kingmaker in a badly hung House. He could make or break any potential government.

 The very politicians who had dismissed his electoral potential grudgingly conceded that if he had damaged Laloo Prasads Muslim base, he had equally eaten into the BJPs upper caste votes. 

 That was an achievement in Bihars caste-fractured polity where it was unthinkable for the Brahmins, Bhumihars, Rajputs and Banias to vote a party led by a Dalit. 

 Unlike Laloo Prasad, who is only identified with the rural masses, Paswan reached out to the classes because he spoke only of neutral issues like good governance and a corruption-free regime.

 To that extent, Laloo Prasads campaign to project him as an ally of only the haves worked. One of the points the RJD chief stressed was how Paswan used only mineral water to shower and dined off sterilised plates and spoons. 

 The quality of the victory proved to be Paswans undoing. From day one, the kingmaker was in a dilemma.

 Should he respect the anti-RJD mandate on which his MLAs won, ditch the UPA, cast his lot with the BJP-Dal (U) and form a government? Or should he remain a minister at the Centre, let Bihar be governed by Buta Singh and use his leverage in the state to push his agenda through?

 The catch in the first option was that the NDA was ready to have only Nitish Kumar as chief minister. The best bargain Paswan could have was deputy chief ministership for his brother Pashupati Nath Paras. On top of that, he would have lost his Delhi job.

 For a while, he was happy in Buta Singhs company and even scored a brownie point or two against Laloo Prasad, as when he watched a cricket match in Patna with the governor and his two sons, Lovely and Sweety, on either side and saw how Laloo Prasads sons could not get seats.

 Paswans happiness was shattered when Laloo Prasad showed he still called the shots in transfers and postings and appointments. The bottomline was the RJD had 24 MPs and Paswan only four.

 Left high and dry, Paswans immediate concern would be to keep his job as a minister and hope the governor obliges him to the extent he can. 

 He said he would think of a realignment closer to the election. Whatever that is, Paswan has lost the political advantage he started with.

 The NDA thinks his marginalisation would help consolidate its upper caste base. As for the Muslims and their time-tested way of voting tactically, if Paswan does not have much of a base vote, would they look at him a second time?

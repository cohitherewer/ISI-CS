 Call for action on porn

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 9: Poornima Advani, chairperson of the National Commission for Women (NCW), will ask chief ministers of all states to strictly enforce provisions of the Indian Penal Code in matters relating to pornography.

 ?Pornography in any form is against the dignity of women and I will write to all chief ministers urging them to enforce Sections 292 and 293 of the IPC,? she told reporters here yesterday. 

 Provisions of the IPC concerning women need a thorough review, she said. Referring to the Anara Gupta case, Advani said the forensic laboratory report ? which said the girl in the pornographic CD was not the former Miss Jammu ? has turned the case on its head. Anara?s mother has raised the issue of breach of dignity and the NCW has written to the Union home secretary seeking stringent action against the guilty police officials, she added.

 The commission has undertaken a review of the IPC and its recommendations will be submitted to the Centre, the NCW chairperson said.

 Advani, who was here to attend a workshop at the National Research Centre for Women in Agriculture, drew the attention of the Orissa government to the problems of unwed mothers and called for a helpline for women in the agriculture sector.

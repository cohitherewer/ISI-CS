 Deadline boon for students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: The recent Supreme Court judgment fixing deadlines for publishing 10+2 results and completing medical college admissions will give students more flexibility with regard to admissions in medical colleges both at the state and national levels.

 ?The system at present is completely chaotic,? says Supreme Court lawyer Mukul Rohtagi. There is a delay at all levels ? first in declaring school results and then while deciding the placement of students in medical colleges. ?The recent judgment will streamline the schedule for admission to medical colleges,? he says. 

 All state boards are faulted for publishing the school final results late. A student often has to appear for a medical entrance test before school results are out. He is allowed provisional admission into a medical college if he cracks the entrance. But he has to furnish his Plus II results within 15 days. Often this is not possible as some state boards delay the results by more than a month.

 The apex court has now made it mandatory for 10+2 results to be published by June 10. The marksheets are to be made available by June 15. The court has ordered that all medical colleges have to begin their course latest by September 30. ?At present, courses were starting as late as January or February,? says Rohtagi.

 He says the admission schedule varies from state to state. ?It is an extremely complex system.? Right now, there are two quota systems ? 15 per cent seats in all-India institutes and 85 per cent in state colleges.

 Students with very high marks in their school finals generally make it to top medical colleges like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. But a student may qualify an all-India entrance and then find out that he has not secured the mandatory percentage in his school results. The problem arises in case of a delay in publishing the results. If the student has been admitted to AIIMS before the results are out, then he will have to drop out of the institute.

 Adding to the students? woes is the delay in counselling regarding their admission. Regulations provide for at least a two-week gap between the first round of counselling for admission in state colleges and the second round for the all-India institutions. If both rounds finish on schedule, students can exercise their widest choice to select an institution.

 This is far from what is happening right now. Many states begin counselling well after the due date, which leaves a student with no choice.

 Godhra probe row

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, June 22: The Centre today said it is ready to entrust investigations in the Godhra cases to the CBI if Gujarat made a request or the court gave an order.

 The UPA government has come under a lot of flak from Left parties for not giving proper attention to the cases. They have been demanding dropping of terror charges against the Godhra carnage accused on the recommendations of a review committee and handing over of all cases to the CBI.

 The Union home ministry was, however, cautious not to get embroiled in any controversy. In a press statement, it put the onus for the decision on the court, especially the Supreme Court, citing the transfer of cases out of Gujarat into Maharashtra.

 ... The government will also support any plea for transfer of cases under trial to courts outside Gujarat. Suitable instructions have been given to the government counsels to inform the Supreme Court about the stand of the government along these lines as and when the cases come up for hearing before the Supreme Court, the statement said.

 The CBI said it could not do anything unless the state government asked it to step in. Home ministry sources said they had expected such a reply as riots and law and order were state subjects and even the Centre could not make a suo motu recommendation for a CBI probe.

 Now the onus is on the Supreme Court to take a stand. It would also be in a position to do so if somebody files a PIL seeking handover of the riot cases to the CBI on the ground that a fair inquiry will not be otherwise possible, an official said.

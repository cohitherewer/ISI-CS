 Woman assaulted in train raid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 22: A gang of armed youths stormed Pushpak Express last night and allegedly raped a newly married woman before pushing three men out of the train.

 The woman said she was sexually assaulted but refused to go for a medical test.

 Armed with guns and knives, eight to 10 youths ? all in their twenties ? boarded the Mumbai-bound train around 10 pm in Bhopal and went on a looting spree.

 When the train neared Vidisha, about 60 km away, they dragged the woman to the toilet and allegedly raped her.

 The gang terrorised the passengers of the unreserved compartment for an hour and a half, snatching valuables and thrashing some of them. 

 Three passengers, Akhilesh, Ajay and Sanjay, all in their late twenties, tried to put up a resistance and slapped one of the goons. The thug retaliated by firing a shot at Ajay. The gang then took the three to the edge of the door and kicked them out. The goons pulled the chain between Kulhar and Bina and fled.

 The three youths have been admitted to a hospital in Jhansi and their condition is said to be critical.

 They did sexually assault me. I kept begging them to take all my money and ornaments but let me go, but two of them pounced on me, the 22-year-old woman said in her statement to Jhansi police. 

 But she refused to go for a medical check-up. What will happen even if she goes for the test? Such criminals are never brought to book, said one of her relatives in Lucknow.

 Her mother-in-law, who was accompanying her, said: They first demanded jewellery and, when I parted with everything I had, they said these were not pure gold. Then they began to abuse me in filthy language and dragged my daughter-in-law from her seat.

 Another witness, 32-year-old Kunti Kanaujia, said no one dared to protest, as the goons were beating up those who did.The passengers later registered a case with the Jhansi Government Railway Police.

 Amitabh Lal, the divisional manager of Northern Railway, said police jawans on the train could not reach the coach as it was not connected with the sleeper coaches.

 Railway minister Lalu Prasad described the incident as unfortunate and has ordered a probe.

 IIT push to revive US research centre

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Kanpur, Oct. 2: IIT Kanpur is planning to launch a joint research programme with the US in hardware manufacturing, an area where India has not made as much progress as in software engineering.

 The Indo-American Centre at the institute, which stopped functioning in 1972, is being revived for the purpose. When the centre was launched in 1961, several US-based professors came to work on joint programmes. In the late sixties, Dr Norman C. Dahel was programme director for this department. 

 But the programmes term expired in 1972 and it was not renewed.

 Sources said the souring of Indo-US relations in the late seventies had taken its toll. But relations between the two countries are looking up now, and the IIT authorities want to take advantage of that. The research wing will have a more durable structure this time, authorities said.

 Once the centre is revived this month, there will be a series of seminars to be followed by research programmes.

 IIT Kanpur director Sanjay G. Dhande said the new research department on manufacturing is being promoted by the Indo-USA Science and Technology Forum. 

 It was at the behest of the forum that Marco B. Deecapua of the US embassy visited the Kanpur institute in August and submitted a report. 

 Kripa Shankar, deputy director of the institute, said: At present we are identifying the frontier areas of research to be joined by US and Indian scientists. This will be followed by (identifying) the specific subjects for research. 

 This will be a small step in the direction of promoting manufacturing of hardware in which India has lot more to do to catch up with the rest of the world.

 To prepare the groundwork, the institute would organise its first international seminar in November on Radio Frequency Identification (Smart Tag) on the campus.

 Play of words in nuke game

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, July 20: Between the and an lay Indias road to freedom from international obligations that would have sat heavy on its nuclear programme.

 Aboard the special Air-India Boeing 747 that took off with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from New Delhi at noon on Saturday an argument was raging between two sides of the accompanying official delegation.

 On one side were those who claimed to speak for the scientific community, like Anil Kakodkar, secretary in the department of atomic energy, V.S. Ramamurthy, secretary in the department of science and technology, and G. Madhavan Nair, secretary in the department of space.

 They would not stand for anything that would open the way for foreign countries or international agencies to eventually ride roughshod over Indias indigenous nuclear, space or missile programmes.

 The ministry of external affairs wanted to show results in the engagement of the US. Above all, the Prime Minister could not go back home with what would appear to be empty hands.

 In the end, Indias ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen, acted as the referee by virtue of his experience of nuclear work.

 In the late 1970s and early 80s, Sen was on deputation to the department of atomic energy and was secretary of the Atomic Energy Commission. In those capacities, he worked both with Homi Sethna and Raja Ramanna, pillars of the nuclear programme.

 Sen negotiated his way through the minefield of divergence of opinions. He made copious changes to the draft of the joint statement which came from the Americans. 

 He added a word here, changed another there. But those words had the potential to change Indias standing in the world as a declared nuclear weapons state.

 The original draft of the statement, 

 for instance, spoke of India signing and adhering 

 to the Additional Protocol with respect to civilian 

 nuclear facilities as part of its quest for US help 

 in developing nuclear energy.

 That sentence was changed to India 

 signing and adhering to an Additional Protocol with 

 respect to civilian nuclear facilities. The significance 

 of that change is that New Delhi will not sign the standard 

 Protocol, which is unfavourable to it as a non-signatory 

 to NPT.

 The US has signed a separate Protocol: the change meant that India would sign that Protocol and not the standard one.

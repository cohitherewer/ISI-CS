 Great divide survives tragedy

 Trincomalee, Jan. 23: The areas north of Trincomalee are a bleak sight. Nilaveli was a tourist hotspot, but the northern regions have seen much violence and are scarred. It is beautiful land though, with mile after mile of green shores and emerald sea. This land is also testament to the will and determination of the people.

 Trincomalee, although on the sea, wasn?t uniformly affected by the tsunami. The worst affected areas are the coastal fishing villages, hours away from the main town, unlike in the south of Sri Lanka, where the entire shoreline is a scene of disaster.

 But here, people are used to hardship. In the middle of a field stands a blackened house with perhaps a wall or two, no roof, holes for windows, with plants and weeds growing all over. This was a house once, ravaged by war. Next to it is a new home, partially destroyed by the tsunami. Next to that is a tent, the newest home for the hapless farmer and his family. His field is flooded, too.

 The area is full of houses destroyed by war ? blemishes on an otherwise scenic landscape. But people have dared to build again.

 Relief organisations, aid agencies and volunteers have been pouring into Sri Lanka since the tsunami struck on December 26. But while a walk on the streets of Galle and its surrounding areas on the southern coast of Sri Lanka will prove that fact, in the north, it is less obvious.

 For a large part, camps of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees for people displaced by the war are doubling as centres for tsunami survivors. While there are armies and organisations from the US to Australia and Chile to Singapore, in Galle, Trincomalee district has attracted less attention.

 Government officials insist that the LTTE?s accusations of unequal distribution of aid are untrue and that work is getting done in the north, while UN agencies are urging NGOs coming to the country to go north instead of staying south. But it doesn?t always happen.

 As a Unicef spokesperson put it: ?The north was never going to get as much attention as the south. For one, the Sri Lankan army is going to be more suspicious here.?

 The army is present, and helping, and while NGOs are being allowed to carry on their work, reports suggest that in some cases, there are roadblocks. There are army checkpoints at every step and demining is in progress, with danger signs marking areas where landmines are buried.

 In the LTTE controlled regions, it?s another story. The Tamil Rehabilitation Organisation is helping in the aid efforts. But Unicef says three underage girls were taken from a relief centre by the LTTE to their training camps. Two were returned, but a third is still missing. An NGO in Trincomalee confirms that a girl is missing, but that the LTTE has promised to return her, too.

 In the tourist town of Nilaveli, the hotels have been gutted, putting many out of job. In the fishing village of Kochchaveli, fishing nets lie entangled with rubble, a window scattered here and a door there. Boats lie hundreds of yards inland, thrown into backyards by the waves.

 Twelve-year-old Banu?s father was out fishing when it happened. He is alive, but has lost his boat and nets. Her mother, brothers and sisters survived because she was going to buy rice and saw the waves coming with enough time to warn them.

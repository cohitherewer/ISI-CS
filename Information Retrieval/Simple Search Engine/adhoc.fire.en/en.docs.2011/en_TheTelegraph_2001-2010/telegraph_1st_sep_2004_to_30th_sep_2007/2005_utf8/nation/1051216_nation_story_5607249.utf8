 Salems driver arrested

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 15: The Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of Mumbai police today arrested Mehdi Hassan, a former driver of don Abu Salem, under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act for his role in the murder of builder Pradeep Jain.

 ATS officials produced Hassan before the designated Tada court judge, P.V. Bavkar, who remanded him in police custody till January 3. This is the third arrest in this case after Salems extradition from Portugal last month.

 Last week, the ATS had arrested two close associates of Salem involved in the 1995 crime ?Salems fund manager Naeem Khan, and Riyaz Siddiqui, who executed the murder.

 Jain was shot dead by Salems hitmen at his office in the western suburbs after a dispute over a property in Andheri.

 Salem allegedly pressured Jain to sell the prime piece of real estate he owned to another builder, and shot him dead after Jain refused to comply.

 ATS officials told the Tada court that Hassan worked as a driver with Salems faction of the Dawood gang, and had driven Jains assailants to the murder spot in March 1995.

 The murder case is one of the eight cases in which the Central Bureau of Investigation had sought Salems extradition from Portugal in 2002.

 After a three-year legal battle in Portugals courts, the CBI succeeded in getting custody of the don and his companion, Monica Bedi.

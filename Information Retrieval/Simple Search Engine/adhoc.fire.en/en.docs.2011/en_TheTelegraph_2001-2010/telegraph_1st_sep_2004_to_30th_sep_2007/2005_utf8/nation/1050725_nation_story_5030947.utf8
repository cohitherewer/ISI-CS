 BJP on Sonia turf

 Rae Bareli, July 24 (PTI): Lal Krishna Advani and other top BJP leaders will descend on Sonia Gandhis home turf Rae Bareli on Thursday.

 State BJP office-bearers met in Lucknow yesterday to finalise arrangements for a grand reception, party sources said. Welcome arches will be erected all over the town, they added.

 The occasion is a hearing in the Babri Masjid demolition case, in which Advani is an accused. Along with co-accused Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti and Vinay Katiyar of the BJP and Ashok Singhal, Giriraj Kishore, Vishnu Hari Dalmiya and Sadhvi Ritambhara of the VHP, he is to appear before a CBI special court here on July 28.

 BJP general secretary Rajnath Singh, state unit chief Kesri Nath Tripathi and a host of senior leaders are heading to Sonias Lok Sabha constituency to take stock of the preparations, the sources said.

 Advani might address a public meeting after appearing in the court. The BJP chief is likely to travel from Lucknow to Rae Bareli in a cavalcade.

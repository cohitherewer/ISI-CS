 Royalty snub for Priyanka

 Priyanka: Money muddle

 Ajmer, March 14 (PTI): The Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education has refused to pay Priyanka Gandhi royalty for one of Jawaharlal Nehru?s pieces being used in its Class X textbook.

 The board, in its budget meeting yesterday, decided to send the royalty for the piece, included in the text during the Congress regime in 2002, to the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, the copyright holder of Nehru?s work, sources said.

 Former board chairman C.P. Vyas, a close associate of former chief minister Ashok Gehlot, had directed that royalty at the rate of Rs 13,000 per year be sent to Nehru?s great granddaughter Priyanka after the fund requested as much, the sources said. Priyanka is a member of the fund. 

 However, the amount could not be sent in the absence of the board?s formal sanction after the regime changed in the state.

 Yesterday, the board decided to remit Rs 39,000 royalty for three years to the fund, the sources said.

 The board also decided to increase the examination fee from Rs 205 to Rs 250 for regular students and from Rs 275 to Rs 325 for private students from the next academic session. The students would also have to pay, besides the examination fee, Rs 25 for each practical. 

 The hike would fetch Rs 36.65 crore annually from the next fiscal, the sources said. It was also decided to give only one chance to clear a paper after failing in a supplementary examination. 

 The procedure of allowing students to see their answer sheets after the declaration of results on paying a fee was also dispensed with, the sources said.

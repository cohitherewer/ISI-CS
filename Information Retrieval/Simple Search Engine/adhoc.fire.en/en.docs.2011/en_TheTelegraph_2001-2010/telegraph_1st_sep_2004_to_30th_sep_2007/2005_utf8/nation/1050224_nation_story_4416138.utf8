 Patna, Feb. 23: The Election Commission?s iron rod, wielded by its consultant K.J. Rao to make a reluctant administration act, ensured a peaceful poll in Bihar with the government reporting two ?related? deaths in the final round today. 

 The total of nine deaths is in sharp contrast to the 48 in the 2000 Assembly elections. Of the nine reported killings this year, five persons died in police firing.

 Border Security Force personnel shot a booth-grabber in Mokamah constituency and a person with criminal antecedents died in a blast while he was making bombs in Lalganj constituency of Vaishali.

 Polling was held today for 93 constituencies in 11 districts and the fate of chief minister Rabri Devi was also decided from Raghopur in Vaishali.

 Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanian described the exercise that began on February 3 as ?one of the most successful ? and very peaceful ? elections in the recent past?. He put the poll percentage between 45 and 50.

 Reports from Siwan said three persons, belonging to the notorious Ajay Singh gang, died while they were assembling bombs in Raghunathpur constituency last night but home secretary Girish Shankar said the incident was ?not related? to the elections.

 All eyes were focused on the Saran division ? comprising the districts of Siwan, Gopalganj and Saran ? but no major incident was reported from the region.

 In Chhapra, RJD nominee and state minister Udit Rai was taken into custody while he was moving in the constituency. Other candidates of the division, including the Janata Dal (United)?s Kedarnath Singh, Lok Janshakti Party?s Munna Mukhia and Independents Arun Singh and Subhash Rai, were also rounded up.

 Reports of electronic voting machines being broken or even not working properly kept pouring in and the chief secretary said the average number of such EVMs could be around 20 in every district. 

 Rabri Devi, her husband Laloo Prasad and other family members came to vote early in the capital and the Rashtriya Janata Dal president exuded confidence that his party will secure a majority in the 243-member House on its own.

 ?Everyone, including the media, got together against us but we will form the next government,? Laloo Prasad said after casting his vote at the local veterinary college booth. Votes will be counted on February 27 and the Assembly has to be constituted by March 6.

 With television channels projecting a hung Assembly, the political parties geared up for the uphill task of making new permutations and combinations for the formation of the government. 

 The mood was upbeat in the NDA camp, which claimed that it will get ?more than 100? seats. ?Exit polls, which are giving us around 100 seats, correctly indicate a trend. The actual numbers will enable us to form a government,? Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar said.

 LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan claimed that his alliance with the Congress will post a ?very good? performance in the elections.

 Cuttack medical strike ends

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 28: The six-day strike by junior doctors of SCB Medical College in Cuttack ended yesterday after chief minister Naveen Patnaik assured them of a compensation of Rs 4 lakh for the family of the slain student and an inquiry into the death.

 The inquiry would be conducted by an officer of the rank of deputy inspector-general.

 Health services at the premier hospital remained paralysed for days owing to the strike, which also had the support of house surgeons. The junior doctors had demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the family members of Arun Kumar, the senior student from Kerala who was killed on April 18, while the state was initially willing to give Rs 2 lakh.

 During their meeting with Patnaik yesterday, the junior doctors were told that in addition to the Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia announced by the government, another Rs 2 lakh would be given to the family of the deceased. 

 The chief minister also assured them that a ward in the medical college would be named after Kumar.

 The junior doctors had earlier demanded a judicial inquiry into the killing of Kumar, which took place only hours after two contractors were gunned down by five men in Bhubaneswar.

 No jeans, its salwars only in college

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 10: On Independence Day, Orissas college students will lose the freedom to dress as they please.

 A month and a half after Mumbai University decided on a dress code, the Orissa higher education department has gone a step further. It has asked students to wear uniforms to their colleges after August 15.

 The code, the department has made it clear, is aimed at banishing jeans, miniskirts, halter tops, tank tops and bare midriffs from campuses.

 From now on, girl students will wear salwar and kameez and the boys, shirts and trousers. The colours are to be chosen by the college authorities.

 Minister for higher education Sameer Dey, who was recently at the centre of controversy over the abolition of Oriya from college syllabuses, said the uniforms will make it easy for college authorities to tell students from outsiders.

 There are other advantages, Dey said. Besides discouraging vulgarity, the uniforms will remove class differences on the campus. After all, a college is a place where both rich and poor students study under the same roof.

 A clutch of Ramadevi Womens College students protested against the diktat today.

 Its so absurd. Who is the minister to decide whether we should wear salwar or jeans? asked Ankita, a plus-two student. Uniforms are no fun, her friend Manaswini agreed.

 Its like going back to school. We cannot accept it, said Jayant Patra of BJB college.

 Several students and youth organisations, including the All India Students Federation, the Orissa Youth Congress and the Orissa Chhatra Janata (S), are furious. The state government has emulated the Taliban, said Amiya Pandav of Chhatra Janata (S).

 But many students have welcomed the code. Sujata Mishra of BJB college said there is a need for uniforms as campuses are increasingly beginning to look like fashion show venues.

 A dress code doesnt impair a students freedom. Freedom doesnt mean students can dress and act in whatever way they like, she said.

 Elated professors and principals arent wasting any time ? of the states 23 autonomous colleges, nearly 20 have chosen the colours for their uniforms.

 We recently discussed the matter with college staff and collected feedback from the students (and picked the colours), said R.P. Rath, principal of BJB College.

 The colleges girl students will wear light wheat-coloured kurtas, coffee-coloured salwars, white dupattas and black sandals. For the boys, its sky blue full-sleeve shirts, black trousers and black shoes. Ties are optional, Rath said.

 Ramadevi Womens College has selected white-and-blue kameezes and white salwars for junior students and green kameezes with green salwars for seniors. Students can wear whatever shoes and ties they want, principal Kasturi Chhotray said.

 Balasores Fakir Mohan College has been somewhat more innovative, selecting black pyjamas and cream-coloured tops with black aprons and shoes for its girl students. The boys are to wear black trousers with cream-coloured shirts and black shoes.

 But the students arent happy. They have handed to principal Trilochan Mohanty a memorandum addressed to the higher education department and signed by about 300 students.

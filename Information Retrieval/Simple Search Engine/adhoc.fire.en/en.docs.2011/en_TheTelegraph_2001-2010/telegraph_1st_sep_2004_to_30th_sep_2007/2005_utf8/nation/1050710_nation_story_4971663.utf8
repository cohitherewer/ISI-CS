 Yes chief minister, live on Net

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, July 9: For probably the first time in the country, you can watch live coverage of all that goes on in a chief ministers office.

 Keralas Congress chief minister, Oommen Chandy, has installed webcams in his chamber at the state secretariat to enhance transparency.

 He hopes people will watch the action on his website www.keralacm.gov.in and realise how transparent and above board his dealings are.

 A VLC player (a portable multimedia player), which is freely downloadable, is required to watch the reality show.

 This new concept of transparency in administration will cover every move of the chief minister in his office, said P.T. Chacko, press secretary to the chief minister. Apart from the webcasts, a chatting facility with the head of the government is under consideration.

 Not everyone is impressed. Instead of at the chief ministers office, the cameras should be installed in five-star hotels where the dealings are done, said K. Muralidharan of the National Congress (Indira).

 Muralidharan, a former state Congress president, and his father K. Karunakaran, a former chief minister, had walked out of the Congress after Chandy became chief minister.

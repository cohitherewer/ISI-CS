The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 ? And on home turf

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, July 29: After clarifications to the Left and the Opposition, the Prime Minister today had to meet senior leaders of his own party to explain the nuclear pact with the US.

 The doubts in the minds of many Congress leaders about the July 18 joint statement prompted party chief Sonia Gandhi to call a working committee meeting at her residence, attended by Manmohan Singh.

 It was important to hold the meeting as we are concerned about perceptions about the Indo-US joint statement, a Congress leader said.

 Party general secretary Ambika Soni told reporters some party leaders had suggested such a meeting but did not name them. It is widely believed that Arjun Singh had cast doubts on the nuclear cooperation agreement.

 The human resource development minister, whose interaction with the Prime Minister is said to have been minimal in recent weeks, did not attend the meeting, though.

 Soni put this down to ill-health. But he had been to Parliament in the morning and, according to an aide, was in his office till 4 pm ? around the time the meeting began.

 Singh, however, received full support from Sonia on the nuclear deal. She opened the meeting with praise for the successful US visit. He faced three specific questions ? on his controversial remark about the Indo-Iranian gas pipeline, on Indias bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council and on how friendly countries like Russia and China might view the Indo-US joint statement.

 Singh said his remark on the pipeline was made at a news conference. There was no US pressure ? the matter was not discussed with the US leadership at any level. As for Russia and China, they have welcomed the joint statement. 

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh said efforts for a Security Council seat will continue whatever the US feels about it.

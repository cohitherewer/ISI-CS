 Sparks fly over super brinjals

 - Global consortium develops genetically modified eggplants

 G.S. MUDUR 

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: An international public-private consortium has developed genetically modified (GM) eggplants that it hopes to soon turn into Indias first edible GM crop. But activists are questioning the rationale of tinkering with brinjal genes.

 The Cornell University-led consortium with agricultural universities in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines as partners has developed GM eggplants resistant to the fruit and shoot borer, the most destructive eggplant pest in South Asia.

 Eggplants today require very high levels of insecticides, said Kannan Vijayaraghavan, regional coordinator of the consortium. The transformed eggplants will sharply reduce the use of insecticides and thus lower residues in plants, he said.

 The GM eggplants are based on Bt technology which was also used in Bt-cotton, resistant to cotton bollworms. 

 The company that introduced Bt-cotton in India has modified eggplants, and sublicensed the technology free to public institutions ? the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, and the Indian Institute of Vegetable Research, Varanasi. 

 The universities have backcrossed the Bt-eggplants with local varieties and hope to make available inexpensive Bt-eggplants to farmers through the public distribution system. Field trials and animal-feeding studies to establish safety are under way, consortium officials said. We expect the plants to be ready for farmers in a year, said Vijayaraghavan.

 A senior government official involved in regulatory approvals for GM crops told The Telegraph that the results of biosafety studies on the eggplant are yet to be submitted to regulators. 

 But, among edible GM crops, the eggplant appears closest to the milestone for approvals, he said. In recent years, scientists in India have also been field-testing GM potatoes among other crops. A private company abandoned attempts to launch GM mustard in India a few years ago after regulators asked it to repeat its biosafety studies. 

 The consortium also plans to deliver Bt-eggplants to farmers in Bangladesh and the Philippines. India, Bangladesh, China and the Philippines account for 90 per cent of global eggplant produce. 

 Indias 510,000 hectares eggplant farms are spread over Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal. The fruit and shoot borers sometimes eat up to 70 per cent of eggplant crop.

 Bt-cotton was introduced in India more than three years ago only through the private sector. Consortium scientists said the public-private partnership would make available inexpensive Bt-eggplants to poor farmers, a project scientist said.

 But scientists and activists in India who have been urging greater transparency on government decisions over GM crops have questioned the rationale for picking the eggplant for genetic manipulation. What does the eggplant have to do with Indias food security? asked Suman Sahai, director of Gene Campaign, a New Delhi-based NGO.

 Some said the attempt to usher in transformed eggplants suggests that the country lacks a well-defined policy on GM plants for food security. 

 Its an ad hoc approach by trigger-happy scientists. They try it on any plant where it works, said Devinder Sharma who is among four individuals who have filed a petition in the Supreme Court urging a moratorium on GM crops until their safety is established.

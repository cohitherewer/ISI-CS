 Laloo needles judge

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, July 29: Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, accused of misusing his position to hush up fodder scam cases against him, today went on the offensive, irritating a Supreme Court judge.

 The minister insisted that Justice S.N. Variava disclose the name of the person who had sounded him on whether a Patna judge hearing cases against Laloo Prasad and wife Rabri Devi could be transferred.

 Justice Variava had on March 15 sparked controversy by announcing in the open court that yesterday, someone contacted me from the high court and indirectly wanted to know whether the trial judge can be changed. He didnt name the high court, but it was understood to be Patna High Court.

 Two days later, though, Justice Variava clarified that there has been no pressure on him to change the trial judge. The person concerned has since clarified to me that the enquiry was just an academic enquiry, he said. I am satisfied that the explanation is correct and my original inference that there was an attempt to influence me was wrong.

 But the controversy wouldnt die down. In June, Yogendra Prasad, a judge hearing a case against the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, was promoted and transferred. He was the fourth judge trying Laloo Prasad to be shifted.

 The matter came up today at the hearing of a public interest litigation by Rajiv Ranjan Lallan of the Janata Dal (United) and Sushil Modi of the BJP, seeking action against the railway minister for allegedly misusing his official position to influence the cases against him.

 As Laloo Prasads counsel B.B. Singh demanded that Justice Variava name the person who had sounded him, the court kept telling him the matter was over. But the counsel persisted.

 An annoyed Justice Variava then began dictating an order stating that the counsel makes allegations against the court that it is protecting a person. He later relented and posted a detailed hearing for August 1.

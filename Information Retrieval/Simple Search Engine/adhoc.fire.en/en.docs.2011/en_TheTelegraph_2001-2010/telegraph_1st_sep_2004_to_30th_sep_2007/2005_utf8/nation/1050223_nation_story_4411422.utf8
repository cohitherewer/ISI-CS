 Snowslip messiahs in worst-hit village

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Feb. 22: Rescue teams this afternoon managed to reach Waltingoo village, worst hit by the avalanches triggered by the heavy snowfall in the last four days. 

 Over 189 bodies have been recovered in rescue efforts that are being hampered because of the thick snow on the ground. ?There is nearly 15 ft of snow in these foothill villages struck by avalanches that rolled down the Pir Panjal mountains,? a senior police official said from Anantnag district. 

 The rescue teams have recovered 150 bodies from Waltingoo alone, he said. The avalanches flattened 200 houses in this village, near the Jawahar tunnel, on Saturday. 

 The police official also said search parties had found 31 more bodies in other foothill villages near Qazigund. Joint rescue teams of the army, police and civilian volunteers left for Qazigund this morning braving blizzards and zero visibility. ?They are in touch with us and doing everything to locate any survivors,? he added.

 Over 300 Indo-Tibetan Border Police troopers and policemen are still trapped in the Jawahar tunnel. ?They had no other choice but to stay inside as massive avalanches started hitting both ends of the tunnel. Fifty ITBP troopers were rescued in the morning with ropes?? said the official.

 In Srinagar, the GOC 15 Corps, Maj Gen Raj Mehta, said 70 ft of snow had fallen on the Line of Control in the Uri sector. ?Our boys are braving it out. It is a Herculean effort. So far, we have no reports of any casualty.?

 Sonia visit

 Sonia Gandhi will visit the Valley on Wednesday to take stock of the rescue operations. Sources said the Congress chief will meet officials in Jammu before visiting Srinagar for an on-the-spot assessment.

 Canada rejects Indian?s stay plea

 Toronto (PTI): An Indian national, whose 

 allegations forced the Canadian immigration minister to 

 resign, has been deported, ending his 17-year fight to stay 

 in Canada.

 Harjit Singh was deported after his allegations that minister Judy Sgro promised him asylum in exchange for free pizzas and elections workers were termed ?simply not believable? by a federal court on Tuesday.

 Forty-nine-year-old Singh, convicted in India for child smuggling, had been in detention since December 26 for failing to report to immigration authorities, news agency Canadian Press reported.

 Sgro resigned from her cabinet post on January 14 after Singh said his arrest and detention were ?politically motivated?. He said Sgro wanted to protect herself from his claims that she had promised he could stay in Canada in exchange for help on her re-election campaign.

 ?The essence of Singh?s case is that an experienced politician would risk her career, her reputation and legal sanctions to assist a person, whom she does not know, in exchange for free pizzas and a few election volunteers, and that the matter would forever remain secret,? federal court Justice Michael Phelan ruled.

 Singh arrived as a visitor in Canada in March 1988 and sought refugee status claiming persecution in India. His pleas were turned down in 1992 but he managed to stay put. Singh has also been charged with a million-dollar credit card fraud by five Canadian banks.

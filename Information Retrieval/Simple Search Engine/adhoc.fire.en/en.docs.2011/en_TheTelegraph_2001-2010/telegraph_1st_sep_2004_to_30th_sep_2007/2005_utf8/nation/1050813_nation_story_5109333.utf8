 Karisma: First round won

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Centre today told Delhi High Court that no illegality was committed while issuing a passport to Karisma Kapoors four-month-old daughter Samaira. 

 The actors husband Sanjay Kapur had filed a petition seeking to restrain her from going abroad with their daughter.

 As per requirements of the Indian Passport Act, either of the parents could apply for issuance of a passport to a minor, the Centres counsel Kailash Gambhir told Justice Mukul Mudgal.

 The high court has given a week to Karisma to file a reply to Sanjays petition. 

 Justice Mudgal has also sought a reply from the actor by August 19 on her husbands allegation that the childs passport was made by flouting all laws and without his consent.

 The court, however, made it clear that its interim order restraining Karisma from taking her daughter abroad would continue till the next date of hearing, which is August 26. Sanjay has been asked to file his rejoinder two days before that.

 A local NGO moved an intervention application seeking to be heard in the case. But the court made it clear that it was not inclined to entertain the organisation as it was a private matter.

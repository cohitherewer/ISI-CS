 Deported bank scamster picked up by police

 Chennai, April 3 (PTI): The most wanted fugitive in the multi-crore Indian Bank scam, M. Varadharajalu, was arrested here today following his deportation from Dubai. He has been on the run for nearly nine years.

 The 65-year-old chairman of the MVR group of industries, against whom the CBI had secured a red corner notice, was detained at Dubai airport recently. 

 The port city authority tipped off the CBI, which had sent a team to seek his deportation, an agency spokesman said.

 Varadharajalu, wanted in 10 cases registered by the CBI in connection with the Indian Bank scam, fled to Singapore in 1996. 

 He is accused of defrauding the Indian Bank of several hundred crores in connivance with bank officials.

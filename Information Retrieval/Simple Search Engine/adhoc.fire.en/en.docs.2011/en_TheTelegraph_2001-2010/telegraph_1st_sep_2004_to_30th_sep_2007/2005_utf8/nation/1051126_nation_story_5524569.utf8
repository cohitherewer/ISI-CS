 Crime spurt

 Nitish Kumar got a taste of the challenges ahead as five murders and two kidnappings were reported in Bihar within 24 hours of his takeover.

 Five people were killed in Madhepura in a suspected vendetta strike by a gang. In Patna, the owner of a coaching centre was kidnapped apparently on his way back from the swearing-in ceremony. In Katihar, a jeweller was adbucted.

 The BJP pointed fingers at the RJD, alleging that the ousted party was trying to derail Nitishs promise to rid the state of crime.

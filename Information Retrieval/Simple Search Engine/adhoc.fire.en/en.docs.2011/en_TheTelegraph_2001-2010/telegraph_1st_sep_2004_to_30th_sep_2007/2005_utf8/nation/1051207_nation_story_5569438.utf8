 Russia open to nuke ties, on US terms

 Moscow, Dec. 6: Russia responded positively to Indias request for expanding cooperation in nuclear energy but made it clear that a forward movement in this sector will be contingent on India meeting the conditions laid down by the US in general and the member countries of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in particular. 

 Russia also indicated that India will have to segregate its military and civilian nuclear facilities.

 This caveat was spelt out clearly by Russian President Vladimir Putin while addressing a press conference jointly with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after a 75-minute meeting at the Kremlin this morning. 

 Putin was asked how, one, India and Russia could expand their co-operation in the nuclear energy sphere and how Russia could supply nuclear equipment and fuel to India while being an NSG member and, two, while the NSG rules were being amended, would Russia take the initiative to create a framework to help India actively in the nuclear sphere.

 Putins answer was: As you are well aware, Russia and India have successfully co-operated in the nuclear energy sector. I am providing you a specific example in the Kudankulam (Tamil Nadu) project. We see India taking all the necessary steps to build relationship with the international nuclear community, including members of the NSG.

 The NSG, which was established in 1975, comprises 44 member states, including the US, Russia and China. The members voluntarily agreed to co-ordinate their export controls governing the transfer of civilian nuclear material and equipment and technology to non-nuclear states. 

 They were expected to forego nuclear trade with governments that did not subject themselves to international measures and inspections. 

 Because the regime is voluntary, NSG members could ultimately make any export they wished to. For instance, in January 2001, Russia transferred fuel to India even though 32 member countries had declared the shipment would contradict Russias NSG commitments.

 The objections from its fellow countries had prompted Russia to tell India it may not be able to build more nuclear reactors until the NSG restrictions were lifted. 

 Today, when the question is of whether Russia would look to a partnership beyond Kudankulam in the nuclear energy sector, Putin sounded more optimistic.

 He said: As India continues to settle its problems with other countries (read NSG members), we hope Russia will have opportunities to participate and co-operate in the field of peaceful use of nuclear energy. 

 Foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna later informed the press that while no specific figures were discussed for additional reactors (in addition to Kudankulam), both sides agreed there were good prospects for expanding co-operation in all sectors of civilian nuclear facilities.

 That the two sides were keen to keep things on track was evident in the other statements that flowed from Putins reply. 

 He said: India is separating military and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, it is also adopting new legislation. India is actively working with NSG members. We consider India our strategic partner and we will work to ensure India will cope with all tests and programmes it is addressing, including in peaceful nuclear energy.

 Queried on whether the issue of Irans nuclear programme and the IAEA talks figured in the meeting and what views were taken by both sides, Putin said it was discussed. We do hope our Iranian partners will comply with all obligations, commitments and agreements.

 G4 huddle after Africa hurdle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Natwar: Talks trip

 New Delhi, July 23: The Group of Four foreign ministers will meet in London tomorrow to discuss the future of their draft framework for restructuring the UN and its Security Council in the wake of the groups failure to reach a consensus with the African Union.

 Yesterday, the G4 and African Union ambassadors failed to reach a consensus when they met at New York to discuss the expansion of the Security Council. The two sides have decided to ask their foreign ministers to sort out the matter at their level and see whether a consensus was still possible.

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh has already left for London where he will discuss with his counterparts from Japan, Germany and Brazil what the G4 needs to do because of the recent developments in New York.

 On Monday, the four foreign ministers will try and convince representatives of the 54-member African Union not to bring out a separate draft and to support the G4 framework agreement in the UN.

 If the two sides again fail to reach an agreement, the G4 ? in the absence of assured support from the African Union ? might decide not to push for a vote on its draft at the end of the month.

 All the G4 members are aspiring for a permanent seat in the expanded UN Security Council, but the group has also asked for two representatives from Africa as permanent members. The African Union also accepts this. The two sides differ over the number of non-permanent seats. The G4 has suggested four non-permanent seats, while the Africans want five seats from the continent.

 The difference over that one seat could lead to the opening of a Pandoras box with many more countries from Latin America, Europe and Asia throwing their hats in the ring for a place in the restructured Security Council.

 The G4 and the African Union also differ over veto power.

 Aware that the present five permanent members will put up a stiff resistance against sharing veto powers, the G4 has already made it clear it will not use veto rights for the next 15 years. This was thought to be the best compromise to ensure that the permanent members do not block their entry into the Security Council altogether.

 But the African Union has been insisting on veto powers on a par with the permanent five from the beginning.

 African foreign ministers may meet to agree on a common position before the Monday meeting with their G4 counterparts. The US has already made its opposition to the G4 draft public. In the absence of US support, India and the other G4 members need the support of most of the 54 nations in the African Union.

 To get the draft passed, the G4 needs the backing of 128 members ? two-thirds in the General Assembly. However, if there is no consensus after the meeting with the African nations on Monday, the G4 may either have to go it alone or pull back its draft from voting in the General Assembly.

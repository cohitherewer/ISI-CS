 Rape rap on priest in London

 AMIT ROY

 London, Jan. 29: A Hindu priest in Britain, found guilty of twice raping a female worshipper by telling her she was his wife in a previous life, will be sentenced on February 18.

 Ramanathan Somanathan, a married 41-year-old who lived in Thornton, south London, was said to have abused his position as a ?respected priest? at the Sivaskanthagiri Arulmigu Murugan Temple in nearby Croydon.

 The 29-year-old rape victim first went to Somanathan to have her horoscope read after she decided to buy a new flat.

 Giving evidence at Croydon Crown Court, the Tamil woman said the second time she was raped at her home in November 2002, she became pregnant and decided to have an abortion. She also admitted attempting suicide several times following the assaults.

 Gillian Etherton, prosecuting, told the court Somanathan had also sexually harassed other worshippers.

 Etherton said the priest asked the woman ?some personal questions and she felt uncomfortable and cried. The defendant told her she had had a bad childhood and he said to her, ?Don?t worry. Everything will be all right now.? He said she had beautiful eyes and it was good she had left her husband.?

 Etherton went on: ?He said they had had a past life together. She had married him and that they had loved each other. She had committed suicide in the past life but God had sent her to him.?

 Somanathan insisted on holding a ?prayer meeting? at her new flat on July 11, 2002. Etherton added: ?He held her by the arms and told her he had a right over her because she was still his wife and he loved her. He threatened her with the consequences of upsetting their God.? He then raped her and afterwards told her: ?You are going to be lucky in your life.?

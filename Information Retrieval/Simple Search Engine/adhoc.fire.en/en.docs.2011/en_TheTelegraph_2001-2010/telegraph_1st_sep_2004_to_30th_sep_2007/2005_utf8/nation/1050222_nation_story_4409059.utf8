 Jamir at Delhi door

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: Goa Governor S.C. Jamir met Union home minister Shivraj Patil here this afternoon to brief him about the prevailing political ?uncertainty? in the state, triggering speculation that it might be brought under President?s rule.

 Jamir, who had hurriedly installed the Pratapsinh Rane ministry on the night of February 2 after dismissing the BJP-led government, is believed to be sceptical about the Congress regime?s ability to win the confidence vote.

 The governor is yet to decide on Rane?s latest recommendation to convene a day?s session on February 28 for taking the floor test. He is also understood to have sought the Centre?s advice to deal with Manohar Parrikar?s petition before the Supreme Court against his government?s dismissal.

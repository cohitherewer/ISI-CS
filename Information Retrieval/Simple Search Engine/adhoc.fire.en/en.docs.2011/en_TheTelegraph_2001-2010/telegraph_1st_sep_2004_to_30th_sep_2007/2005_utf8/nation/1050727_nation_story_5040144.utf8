 Advani: Adjusting stance

 New Delhi, July 26: L.K. Advani looks determined to make the most of the Jinnah remark reprieve he has secured from the RSS, both as leader of Opposition and BJP president.

 At a meeting of the BJP parliamentary party this morning, he conceded the NDAs boycott of Parliaments budget session had created a wrong perception among people that the combine was not interested in discussing or resolving problems facing the nation.

 Although the combines grievances against the UPA regime were legitimate, it had possibly failed to communicate its stand to the people, he said. To undo the damage, all MPs should participate in House proceedings and raise issues of public concern.

 BJP spokesperson Sushma Swaraj, however, denied Advani had spoken of the boycott. She claimed all he said was we are in a mood to corner the government on every issue. But some MPs insisted otherwise.

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ? who had never approved the boycott ? used the meeting to covertly reinforce his disapproval.

 Sources said Vajpayee pointed out that MPs had come prepared to attack the government in the last session but had to spend most of their time outside the House. This time, they should to sit inside and do the needful, he said.

 To signal to his MPs he meant business, Advani today initiated a discussion on an adjournment motion on illegal immigration from Bangladesh. He described it as one of the three main threats to national security, the others being terrorism and Naxalism.

 Keeping the Assam polls in mind and the emotive and divisive potential of the illegal immigration issue, he repeated the BJP line that it was more dangerous and crippling than terrorism and Naxalism.

 He also told the Lok Sabha he had recalled Jinnahs speech during his recent Pakistan visit only to remind the people their founder had wanted to establish a secular state.

 Outside Parliament, Advani seemed set to use his July 28 appearance before a Rae Bareli court hearing the Babri case as a demonstration of his commitment to Hindutva and the Ram temple. 

 The BJP has directed its Uttar Pradesh unit to organise a roadshow from Lucknow to Rae Bareli so that Advani can address meetings on the day of the hearing.

 But state BJP spokesman Hriday Nath Dixit said on phone from Lucknow: We have no such plans, we have only been told a few state leaders will travel with him.

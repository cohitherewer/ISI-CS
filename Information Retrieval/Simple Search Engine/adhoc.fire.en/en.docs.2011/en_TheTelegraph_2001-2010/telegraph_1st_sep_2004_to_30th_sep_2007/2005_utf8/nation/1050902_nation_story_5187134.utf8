 Beggar rides people power

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Sept. 1: Dharamveer Nat comes from a criminal caste; yet he chose a life of honest begging, taking only after asking.

 Now he has got the one thing he had never begged for: votes.

 Khaikhedi in Uttar Pradesh has elected the Dalit beggar its gram pradhan, thumbing its nose at the mainstays of state politics: money, crime, caste and power politics.

 We have seen enough of the greed of the rich; now a beggar will fix the priority of work to be done in the village, said Suman Kumar, a neighbour.

 Dharamveer, Bhura to villagers, was at first unwilling to contest, saying he had never had anything to do with politics or power.

 But the 30-year-old from the stigmatised Nat caste was persuaded to change his mind. His supporters raised the money by begging.

 Bhura was admired for his mild manner and soft-spoken ways. We believe he will interact better with the villagers and get work done, said Sital Vaish, another villager.

 Khaikhedi, in Purkaji block of Muzaffarnagar district, has a mix of almost all the principal castes. There are the upper castes like Thakurs and Brahmins and the middle castes like Yadavs and Kurmis. But the Dalits are a majority and so the gram panchayat was reserved for Scheduled Caste members.

 That would not have made things easier for Dharamveer. The three other Nat families are looked down upon, for the community is seen as prone to crime and using its women for prostitution.

 But Dharamveer was different. He was honest and had won villagers admiration by stitching together enough to see his brother through engineering college.

 The man cant read or write; yet he is a storehouse of information on local and state politics. His wife and sister beg like him but he is determined to give his two young children a better life.

 Villagers hope other Nats would take a leaf out of his book and reform themselves. After Dharamveer was declared elected on Monday, by a margin of 58 votes, his supporters travelled with him to Muzaffarnagar town, 30 km away, and marched through the streets.

 The new pradhan promises to call regular gram sabha meetings, where villagers will decide myriad aspects of rural life, such as which roads to repair first and where to install a tubewell.

 Ill do it, Dharamveer said. After all, the people of the village love me.

 Earlier, I used to beg for myself and my family. Now I shall go up to senior officers and leaders to beg for money for my village.

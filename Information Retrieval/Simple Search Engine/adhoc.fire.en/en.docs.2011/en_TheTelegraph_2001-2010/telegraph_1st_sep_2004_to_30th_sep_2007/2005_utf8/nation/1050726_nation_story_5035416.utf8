 NDA terms notice tight slap to Centre

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 25: The NDA has planned to bring an adjournment motion against the UPA government for extending Presidents rule in Bihar by six months.

 The Union cabinets decision to extend Presidents rule came today even as the Supreme Court sent notices to the Centre and the Bihar governor on the imposition of central rule after some former NDA MLAs challenged the dissolution of the Assembly.

 The BJP described the Supreme Courts notice as a tight slap on the Centres face and the cabinets decision as hasty.

 The courts notices are a tight slap on the face of the Centre and the state government. They had dissolved the House even before it was constituted. It was a criminal act on the governors part not to have called Nitish Kumar (Janata Dal-United leader) to form the government despite having the support of (a) majority of the legislators, said V.K. Malhotra, the BJP parliamentary party spokesperson.

 Malhotra questioned the cabinets move to extend Presidents rule on two grounds. First, Parliament was in session until August 26 and, second, central rule was to expire on September 6. He alleged that the government sought to pre-empt the apex courts verdict. The government seems to be in a haste to draw the curtains on the issue but we will raise it vociferously in the Lok Sabha through an adjournment motion, he said.

 RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav kept his counsel to himself and said: I would not like to make any comment on this. I dont know anything. It is for them (the officers of the Bihar governor) to speak on this issue. 

 Sources said the cabinet decision would be ratified in the monsoon session.

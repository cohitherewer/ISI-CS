 Private pill for sick oilseed company

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 18: The government has decided to privatise the loss-making Orissa State Oilseed Growers? Federation, also known as Oil Orissa.

 The government authorised the public enterprise department to evaluate the assets and liabilities of the ailing unit following a high-level meeting chaired by finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei.

 Sources said tenders would be invited from private parties interested in taking over the sick unit. 

 Oil Orissa was set up in 1982 with the aim of promoting production of oilseeds and allied products. The enterprise won profit for 10 years till 1992 and also won plaudits from the National Productivity Council, Delhi for its efforts.

 After 1992, the situation went from bad to worse in the space of a few years. The PSU has assets worth Rs 39.36 crore and liabilities to the tune of Rs 33 crore, which includes the loan burden. The cumulative loss stands at Rs 20 crore.

 An estimated Rs 7 lakh is required to meet the establishment costs every month. The employees are paid 50 per cent of the salary from rentals of the godown and office building. Of a total of 156 employees, 43 had opted for voluntary retirement in 2001 while 39 others were deployed in other government departments and agencies.

 The government had submitted a proposal to the National Dairy Development Board to provide assistance for the revival of the sick enterprise but no response has come till date, sources said.

 In its bid to rightsize the administration, the government has abolished around 32,000 vacant posts under various departments, universities, state-aided educational institutions and urban local bodies in the past five years.

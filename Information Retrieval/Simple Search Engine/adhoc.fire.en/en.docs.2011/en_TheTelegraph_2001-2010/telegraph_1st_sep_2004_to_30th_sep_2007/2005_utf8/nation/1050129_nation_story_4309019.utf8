 Buddha seeks settler report 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 28: West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya has sought a report from the CPM?s Orissa state unit on ?quit India? notices served by the Naveen Patnaik government on 1,551 illegal settlers in Mahakalpada block of Kendrapara district.

 After the Congress and BJP?s opposition to the state government?s decision to deport illegal Bangladeshi immigrants from the Mahakalpada block of Kendrapara district, CPM has taken up cudgels on behalf of the settlers.

 Last week, some of the immigrants had petitioned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Bhattacharya seeking their intervention in the matter. 

 Following the request of the immigrants, Bhattacharya sought a report from CPM state unit secretary Janardan Pati.

 ?Bhattacharya had telephoned me a couple of days ago and wanted to know the details about the ?quit India? notices served by the state government on 1,551 people of Bangladeshi origin in Kendrapara district. I would be sending him the details in a day or two,? said Pati.

 Criticising the BJP and the Sangh Parivar for trying to divide the people on communal lines by opposing deportation of Hindus alone, Pati said CPM is against deportation of any person from the state.

 He added that the West Bengal chief minister was concerned about the future of the immigrants who were issued notices under the Foreigner?s Act, 1946, to leave the country. Pati said the party has also appealed to the Centre to grant citizenship to all Bangladeshis irrespective of caste and religion. 

 He said chief minister Naveen Patnaik raked up the deportation move to divert people?s attention from the Tangarpada mine scam.

 He said the state CPM would request defence minister Pranab Mukherjee to direct the Border Security Force (BSF) not to allow deportation of any Bangladeshi immigrants from the state.

 Divest doubts dog Cong

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, July 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who faces the immediate task of resolving the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel) dispute with the Left parties, may also need to seek a consensus in his party on the larger policy issue of divestment.

 Party leaders say its up to the Prime Minister and finance minister P. Chidambaram to find a solution to the Bhel stalemate, because the government held no political consultations on the sale of shares in the navratna PSU before announcing the decision.

 These leaders agree with the Left that the divestment proposal was not discussed in advance at the United Progressive Alliance-Left co-ordination committee. They further say the matter had not been discussed even in the alliances own co-ordination committee or within the Congress.

 The government must have taken the decision on the basis of the common minimum programme as it lays down broad policy parameters for governance, said a party leader.

 Acknowledging the lack of a clear-cut understanding of the Bhel dispute among Congress leaders outside the government, some party sources said broader political consultations could have helped avoid the present controversy.

 Within the party, there are widely divergent views on economic reforms, particularly divestment, because our manifesto for the last general election stated that we are for reforms with a human face, a source said.

 The Lefts objections to the Bhel divestment has received indirect endorsement from two Congress cabinet ministers ? Mani Shankar Aiyar and Sis Ram Ola. Aiyar had recently written to Chidambaram, opposing the finance ministrys divestment proposals in oil sector PSUs while Ola had protested against the proposal to sell Nalco shares.

 The seeming contradictions within the party can be avoided if there is a broad understanding on the divestment policy, said the leader.

 Convinced of the need to continue with divestment to raise funds to meet the UPAs social sector commitments, Singh had, in mid-May, urged the Congress Working Committee to evolve a consensus within the party. So far, the party leadership has not considered the suggestion.

 Tragedy trumps soaps

 All eyes: Children watch 

 television at home 

 Mumbai, Aug. 7: It could be concern. It could be the attraction of watching a calamity unfold on screen. But theres no TV ratings-spinner like a natural disaster.

 When Mumbai was deluged last week ? the downpour began on July 26 ? TV viewership for news channels skyrocketed across metros. At the expense of soaps and films.

 According to TAM, the television audience measurement agency, the viewership of news channels in the six metros during the week July 24-30 equalled levels seen during the tsunami crisis last December. During both calamities, news channels commanded 11 per cent of the viewership pie.

 In Mumbai, the floods caused more concern among viewers than the August 25, 2003, twin blasts that killed 50-odd people.

 During the blasts, news channels had clocked a viewership of 9 per cent in Mumbai. During the deluge week, that rose to 17 per cent ? from 8 per cent four weeks earlier.

 The mass entertainment channels commanded a market share of 35 per cent in Mumbai four weeks ago. During the flood week, they accounted for 27 per cent. Hindi film channels, which made up 13 per cent of the pie, shrunk to 10 per cent.

 The sports channels share, though, rose to 5 per cent in Mumbai from 3 per cent four weeks ago. Perhaps sports is more comforting than saas bahus in times of trouble.

 The estimates factored in the increased number of news channels since the blasts, said Siddhartha Mukherjee, director, corporate communications, TAM Media Research.

 The news channel audience grew most in the Hindi-speaking market ? by 95 per cent compared with the average four weeks ago. In the six metros, news channel viewership rose by 82 per cent and across India, by 57 per cent.

 On July 26, of course, when lakhs of Mumbaikars spent the night on the streets in the rain, and there was no power, TV viewership in Mumbai fell 55 per cent during prime time.

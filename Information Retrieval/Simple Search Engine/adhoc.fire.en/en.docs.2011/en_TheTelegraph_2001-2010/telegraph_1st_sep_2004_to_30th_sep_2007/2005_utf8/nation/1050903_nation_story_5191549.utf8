 10 years to umbrella US science pact

 Bangalore, Sept. 2: India and the US will sign an agreement for collaboration in science and technology next month, after a decade of negotiations over intellectual property rights.

 The umbrella agreement on science and technology follows similar pacts in nuclear energy and space and dual-use technologies signed by President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in July.

 In 1998, the US administration had placed several research and development facilities, including the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, on the entity list following the Pokhran nuclear tests. The IISc was taken off the list in 2002, but collaborations in cutting-edge technology were on hold.

 Next months agreement, covering areas such as healthcare, biotechnology and nanotechnology, will be signed during science and technology minister Kapil Sibals trip to Washington.

 Under the pact, the US will help India constitute an entity similar to the Food and Drugs Administration. It will be an independent Indian entity, but it will follow world-class certification protocols, acceptable to the FDA and other authorities around the world, Sibal said.

 The certification of clinical trials of drugs by such an organisation will pave the way for automatic acceptance of drugs in the US market.

 According to Sibal, the agreement will prove to be a win-win situation for both countries. When you learn about it (the benefits of collaboration), you will find that give and take is as much on our side as theirs.

 The agreement will enable India to hasten the process of getting the US to co-operate in areas of nanotechnology and biotechnology, while India can offer the fast breeder reactor technology to the US, the minister explained.

 Earlier, Sibal told a seminar here on Science and technology opportunities and Indo-US relations that the collaboration would signal a great step forward and facilitate co-operation at all levels of scientific activity. In the last 10 years, we (India and the US) were not able to agree because the US wanted a particular way with IP issues (stringent patent and copyright laws). Now, we have agreed on the language and finer points of IP issues.

 The minister said an authority on the lines of the FDA would help India emerge as a pharma hub. If we dont have such systems, the drugs developed in India will not have the standards on which the others go by.

 Besides, he added, it would help save the time and money spent on repeat trial of drugs by US companies that turn to India for expertise and inexpensive laboratory procedures.

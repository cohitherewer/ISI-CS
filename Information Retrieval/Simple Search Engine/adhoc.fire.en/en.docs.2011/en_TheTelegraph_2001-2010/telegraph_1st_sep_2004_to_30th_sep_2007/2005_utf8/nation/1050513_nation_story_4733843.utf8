 raped by an autorickshaw driver and his accomplice on the 

 outskirts of Jodhpur city on Wednesday.

 SC disinherits father killer

 New Delhi: A son convicted for murdering 

 his father loses claim to his paternal property along with 

 his wife and children, reports our legal correspondent.

 The ruling, handed down by a Supreme Court division bench, came on a petition filed by the wife of a person who had murdered his father. 

 Dismissing the wifes claim of legal right to inherit her father-in-laws property, the bench said the murderer son is totally disinherited and, therefore, his wife and children would also lose the right to the property.

 Once the son is totally disinherited, then his whole stock stands disinherited, that is wife or son, Justices Ashok Bhan and A.K. Mathur said in a 23-page judgment.

 R. Singaperumal, the only son of Ramaswamy Konar, had murdered his father and incurred the disqualification clause in the Hindu succession act that says a person who commits murder or abets the killing stands disqualified from inheriting the property of the person murdered.

 According to Section 27 of the act, if any person is disqualified from inheriting any property it shall devolve as if such person had died before the intestate, that is before having made a will.

 Ramaswamy Konars daughter-in-law Vellikannu, the judges said, was also not entitled to inherit his estate. When a son cannot succeed, then the wife, who succeeds to the property through the husband, cannot also lay a claim to the property of her father-in-law.

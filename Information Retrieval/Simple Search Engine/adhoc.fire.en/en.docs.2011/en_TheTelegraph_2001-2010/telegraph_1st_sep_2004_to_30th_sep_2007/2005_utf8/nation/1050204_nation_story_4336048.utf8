 ?Safe passage? buzz

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, Feb. 3: Several Naxalite leaders, including those from Jharkhand and Bihar, were reported to have been allowed safe passage on instructions from Hyderabad after the Greyhound commandos ? of the crack anti-Naxalite force ? surrounded them in a forest this afternoon.

 Among those said to be let off were Ramakrishna, the state secretary of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), Sudhakar Peer, secretary of the north Telengana zone of the rebels, S. Appa Rao, a mediator, and some top leaders of the erstwhile Maoist Communist Centre from Bihar and Jharkhand.

 The move comes amid a string of deadly attacks by the Naxalites that has left 10 persons dead in the state after the extremists pulled out of the peace talks with the government earlier this month accusing it of unleashing its forces on them. 

 The action in the forest coincided with high drama in Hyderabad. Civil activists and Naxalite emissaries Varavara Rao and Gaddar received frantic calls and mobile messages from the Naxalite leaders, claiming they were surrounded by the commandos in the Nallamala forests, about 262 km from Hyderabad between Prakasham, Nalgonda and Mahboobnagar districts, and there was a grave threat to their lives.

 The duo rushed to police chief Swaranjit Sen and home minister K. Jana Reddy, who initially denied the commando raid but later ordered their withdrawal. 

 As an agitated Rao threatened that the state and Centre would face the consequences if anything happened to the top leaders, particularly Ramakrishna, the government assured nothing that would hamper the peace process would be allowed to happen.

 The emissaries and mediators of the peace process have put the onus on the government of creating a conducive atmosphere to coax the Naxalites back to the talks table. 

 ?The government should decide whether it is serious about talks or wants to fight the Maoists with guns like Chandrababu Naidu,? said K.G. Kannabiran, one of the mediators.

 The official mediator, S.R. Sankaran, a former bureaucrat who recently hit the headlines for rejecting the Padma Bhushan, has called for restraint from both sides.

 But violence continued, with four Maoists falling to police bullets in Adilabad district, 340 km from Hyderabad, this morning. 

 District police superintendent Krishnaprasad Tripathi Ujela said the Maoists opened fire on the police, drawing retaliatory shots that killed four of the 10 activists.

 ?We have secured several weapons and ammunition besides incriminating literature from the scene of action. The Maoists were busy raising donations from the traders and forest contractors,? he said.

 Two more persons were butchered in the early hours today in Adilabad, said the police. 

 The rebels have stepped up attacks in Karimngar, Warangal and Nalgonda districts over the last four days after a landmine failed to blow up a bus carrying commandos and teachers in Guntur last week.

 ?They have murdered 10 persons, including five politicians and three advocates, in retaliation for the encounter killings,? said Sen yesterday.

 Gates open, walk in or walk out

 Jehanabad, Nov. 14: Prisoner Satyendra Kumar Yadav found himself in a dilemma when the Maoists asked him to run away just before 10 pm yesterday.

 The man arrested under the Arms Act finally decided to stay on because he was sure he would be acquitted after trial.

 Hundreds of prisoners at Jehanabad district jail took the same decision but many chose to make a dash for an unexpected freedom. 

 After the attack by some 1,000 Maoists last night, the jail where more than 600 prisoners had been crammed together had about 300 inmates left today.

 Its a rough estimate, because the shell-shocked and clueless officials are still counting heads. Among those who are gone are three kinds of inmates ? Maoist rebels freed by their comrades, Ranbir Sena workers abducted by the raiders and, of course, the usual prisoners.

 The gate has been wide open almost since 10 pm, Yadav said more than 12 hours later this morning. Walk in or walk out ? its your choice. No one stops anyone any longer.

 When The Telegraph team reached the jail today, there was no way of telling who was a prisoner and who an outsider. A crowd of friends and relatives had gathered at the jail after news of last nights CPI (Maoist) attack broke.

 I have just come back from the tea shop outside the main gate. My elder brother had come to meet me. I spent a long time with him, said a prisoner who did not wish to be identified.

 The official visiting hours are too short and visitors are allowed only once a week. But today is a great day.

 It (the Maoist attack) was a well-planned operation and they had a very good idea of the layout. They did not harm us. They merely warned us to stay put at one corner because they were firing. We just huddled together. By 10.30 pm, we were free.

 An elderly man broke down the moment he spotted his son outside the jail gate. He is innocent, the man mumbled between sobs.

 The inmate began to console his father. Look, I am safe and sound. Why are you crying? I am not running away. Dont worry, I shall complete my term and return in three months.

 The prisoner later said that at least 200 inmates were roaming freely outside the jail. No one is stopping us, so whats the harm? Around 100 people are still inside, too scared to come out. I can understand that. Last night we were all afraid; we couldnt understand what was happening.

 A woman and her son were crying loudly because she hadnt been able to find her jailed husband. Kahan chal gelthin? Ham badi khojaliye hunkara (where is he gone? I looked for him everywhere), she wailed. Another woman tried to console her.

 A young undertrial, who did not look more than 22, was laughing, surrounded by his friends. 

 Thanks to the Naxalites, I can meet all of you so unexpectedly. Is everything fine in the town? he asked one of his friends.

 The young man was not ready to reveal his name or the charge against him. Hum local hain (I am a local), he said. Please dont badger me. Let me enjoy myself. After all, sooner or later, I have to go back inside.

 India keeps US aviation flag flying

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, April 27: India decides. America celebrates.

 Air-India?s $6.9 billion order for 50 Boeing aircraft, announced in Mumbai yesterday, is spreading cheer in Seattle, Chicago, Washington, New York and Evendale ? in short across large parts of America.

 The order, huge by aviation standards, will enable Boeing to turn the corner in its hitherto losing battle with arch rival, the European Airbus.

 Boeing had predicted last year that its order book for a new 787 plane would cross 200 by January 1, 2005, but failed to achieve that target.

 Air-India?s decision on Tuesday, along with an order from Air Canada for 787s a day earlier, enabled Boeing to cross that target, albeit three months behind schedule. The 787 is due to take off with fare-paying passengers three years from now.

 The impact of Air-India?s order was immediately felt on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing shares soared to their highest level since September 11, 2001, but later closed down 0.97 per cent at $59.

 Air-India?s announcement was also reason for much back-slapping on Capitol Hill, where Congressmen from the India Caucus have been lobbying hard with the Indian government to secure the order for Boeing.

 Forty-three members of the House of Representatives had earlier written to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee urging him to consider the US manufacturer?s claim for the order.

 ?This sale would provide the struggling economy with a shot in the arm when it needs it most,? Jim McDermott, Democratic Congressman from Washington state ? till recently Boeing?s headquarters ? had said at that time.

 Boeing, now headquartered in Chicago, left no stone unturned in its quest for doing new business in Mumbai?s Nariman Point, the Air-India headquarters. 

 US officials and political leaders, including President George W. Bush, underscored Boeing?s case in their meetings with Indian counterparts in both the NDA and UPA governments.Boeing recruited former US ambassador to India ? and later under-secretary of state for political affairs ? Thomas Pickering, mainly to use his influence in New Delhi and work on Air-India.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel was bombarded with queries and requests on behalf of the airline manufacturer when he was here recently. Later, US transportation secretary Norman Mineta visited India.

 In Evendale, Ohio, the town?s population welcomed the announcement from Nariman Point because it will bring a spin-off order of $700 million for GE Transportation, which supplies jet engines to Boeing.

 The order would be worth much more for the local plant if the new 787 planes, 27 of which have been ordered by Air-India, also opt for GE engines when they come off the production line three years later.

 Boeing, a showpiece of US industry, has been mired in scandals, poor morale and a strong challenge from Airbus recently. 

 Its dealings with the US Air Force have been targeted on Capitol Hill and its lobbying operations and dealings with the Pentagon have come under fire.

 The Air-India order, along with some from Korean and Chinese airlines, may wipe off some of that bad publicity.

 PM puts in place Dalit welfare monitor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has set up a committee of ministers on Dalit affairs to oversee implementation of welfare and development programmes now under way in various ministries.

 The idea behind this ?consolidated? monitoring of the schemes is to enable the Centre to identify the gaps in them and help develop mechanisms to set them right, according to a news release issued by the Prime Minister?s Office.

 The release said the Prime Minister felt that despite large allocations to programmes aimed at improving the lot of the Dalits, the results did not match the outlays. The ministerial committee will examine ways in which the increased outlays will translate into ?improved outcomes?, it said.

 Among the tasks set out for the committee are:

 Launching a massive awareness campaign with the backing of non-government organisations to ensure that Dalit families benefit from the programmes

 Centre to encourage states to fulfil promises made on poll planks like identifying surplus land under the Land Ceiling Act and redistribute them to Dalits and pay special attention to adult and children?s education

 Recommend special legislative steps to increase the economic and social empowerment of Dalits.

 The committee, which will be serviced by the social justice and empowerment minister, will be chaired by the Prime Minister. Its members will include the defence, human resource development, agriculture, home, law and justice and rural development ministers and the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. Although the chemicals, fertilisers and steel ministries are not directly connected to the committee, the minister, Ram Vilas Paswan, has also been put on it.

 Backward quotas on govt radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 8: The government will monitor job quotas for the Other Backward Classes from time to time, to see if there were backlogs and fill in the vacancies as quickly as possible. 

 This will be the first such move after the implementation of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission report that proposed a 27 per cent job reservation in the government sector for the OBCs.

 The Union cabinet, in a meeting this morning, took stock of the job quotas meant for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and the OBCs.

 It decided to set up a commission under the cabinet secretary to ?strengthen and speed? up the process of filling in the vacancies which arose over the years. 

 This commission will monitor the ?progress? made in this regard and submit a status report to the cabinet, said information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy.

 He said a recruitment drive would be launched to fill the vacancies and all ministries and departments have been asked to fill in the quota meant for promotions as well, apart from the direct recruitments. 

 The decision was meant to fulfil a resolution contained in the UPA?s common minimum programme, which stated that ?all reservation quotas, including those relating to promotions, will be fulfilled in a time-bound manner. To codify all reservations, a Reservation Act will be enacted?. 

 The cabinet noted that regarding the codification of reservations, a bill, called the SC, ST and Other Backward Classes (Reservation in posts and services), Bill, 2004, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha last December.

 The cabinet also approved the constitution of a second administrative reforms committee, tasked to prepare a blueprint for revamping the public administration system.

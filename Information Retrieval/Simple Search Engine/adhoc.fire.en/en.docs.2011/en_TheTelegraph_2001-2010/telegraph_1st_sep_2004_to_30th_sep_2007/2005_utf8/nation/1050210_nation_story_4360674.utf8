 Ministry sweats over PF hike 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: The labour ministry is worried over how to raise the extra money needed to meet the United Progressive Alliance government?s commitment to raise the provident fund interest rate from 8.5 to 9.5 per cent.

 ?The Prime Minister made a commitment. The labour ministry was not consulted. Now, the Central Board of Provident Fund Trustees will have to mobilise more money,? a labour ministry official said. The board will meet on February 21 to discuss the options.

 The provident fund interest rate declined from 12 per cent in 2000-01 to 9.5 per cent in 2001-02 as the interest rate on special deposit schemes came down from 11 to 9.5 per cent. The fund had invested its bulk money in the SDS deposits. Hence the corresponding fall in the PF interest rate.

 The government?s decision to hike the interest rate has come despite reservations in the finance and labour ministries. It was believed that the government decided on the hike to pacify the Left, which was upset with the decision to hike the FDI cap in telecom.

 Provident fund statistics show the hike from 8.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent will benefit those in the top salary brackets. For instance, those with an average balance of Rs 54,48,660 in the fund will get maximum money followed by those with Rs 25,06,620 and Rs 13,16,782.

 The Left and trade unions are coming in for criticism for insisting on a decision that will help the better-off organised sector employees rather than the vulnerable unorganised sector workers. 

 Labour experts argue it is the unorganised sector workers who need legal and financial help. 

 Thirty-seven crore workers of the 40-crore workforce in the country are in the unorganised sector. 

 Trade union leaders, however, deny their preoccupation with organised sector workers and neglect of the unorganised sector. 

 ?We have been demanding a central legislation for agricultural workers who constitute majority of the unorganised sector workforce,? says a Citu leader. But they have failed to pursue the demand with the tenacity they have shown in the provident fund interest rate issue.

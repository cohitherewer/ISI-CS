 Forget past, were pals now: China 

 - No repeat of history, vows neighbour

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sun Yuxi: Hopeful

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: China today said it does not want any more hiccups in its relations with strategic partner India though the two sides dont see eye to eye on what sparked the 1962 war.

 We are now partners, not rivals. We are friends, not enemies.... If you talk too much of the past, it is out of fashion, Chinas ambassador in New Delhi Sun Yuxi said. 

 We will make sure that what happened in history will never happen again.

 A series of meetings between the two sides are lined up this month, including one in less than 10 days between President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Signals from Beijing indicate it does not want any shadow cast on bilateral ties before the meetings.

 At a seminar on Sunday, the two sides had publicly aired differences over the 1962 war. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee termed it an invasion, provoking the Chinese consul-general in Mumbai to lodge his protest. Sun, however, said China would not like to pursue the matter.

 I am sorry if there are any misunderstandings on the issue. Between friends there should be no misunderstanding. We must have a forward-looking relationship, he said.

 Sun was speaking on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The idea was to tell the world Tibet is an integral part of China and to showcase its achievements under Chinese rule.

 The occasion, being held in India for the first time, was also a pointer to Chinas confidence about its current relations with India.

 Sun said the forthcoming meeting between Hu and Singh would give a push to the strategic partnership the two sides had entered into this April.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil left for Beijing today to hold talks with the Chinese leadership on fighting global terror, building close relations between the police of the two countries and taking steps to check cross-border crime.

 India and China are to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on exchange of security-related information and sharing of intelligence.

 Patil will observe the functioning of the police in Shanghai and Beijing during his five-day trip. This is part of the Centres plan to modernise the police force, especially in Delhi and Mumbai where the crime-population ratio is among the worst in the world.

 Sources said the two sides would seek to sign an MoU on extradition of criminals.

 Between September 26 and 28, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan will be in Beijing to hold talks with Chinese counterpart Dai Binguo on steps to demarcate boundaries and resolve the border row.

 Sun said Chinas opposition to the G4 resolution on UN reforms did not mean it was against Indias entry into the Security Council. Our main opposition is on Japan.

 New Delhi, July 24: The Left parties have asked for a structured discussion on the United Progressive Alliance governments foreign policy in Parliament.

 They seemed worried about the growing Indo-US ties, especially after the pact between Delhi and Washington on civilian nuclear technology.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has indicated that he will make a suo motu statement in Parliament in the next few days on his visit to the US and the summit meeting with President George W. Bush. But the Left wants a full-fledged discussion on foreign policy.

 While the Prime Minister will make a statement on his US visit and the nuclear deal, there is an urgent need for discussing the larger implications of foreign policy, the Left parties said in a joint statement this evening. 

 The leaders of the four Left parties ? the CPI, CPM, RSP and the Forward Bloc ? met today to discuss the issues they wanted to highlight in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning tomorrow. 

 They have also demanded a similar structured discussion on the defence pact that was signed between India and the US during defence minister Pranab Mukherjees visit to the US earlier this month.

 The Left leaders, particularly CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, had expressed concerns about India coming under US pressure before Singh left for Washington. 

 The Prime Minister, however, met the Left leaders before his departure and assured them that he would not get into any agreement that was against the countrys interests.

 The Left, whose support is crucial for the Centre, has so far not commented on the nuclear deal. But they reacted sharply to media reports on remarks made by Singh during an interview in the US on the proposed India-Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline.

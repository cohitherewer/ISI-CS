 Srinagar, Feb. 14: Mushtaq Ahmed came out of the frying pan only to land in the fire.

 The 25-year-old had been stranded on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway for seven days as avalanches and landslides blocked the strategic road ? the only link between the Valley and the rest of the country.

 Mushtaq recently reached his home in Nowshera locality in downtown Srinagar city after what he called his ?rebirth on the highway?. The youth thought that the comfort of home would make him forget the trauma of being stranded on the highway. But a shock was in store.

 ?It was one of those ironies of fate. Starving, shivering and famished, I reached home to discover that my family was battling with no less tortuous odds. There was no cooking gas. There were no vegetables and there was no electricity. It was as if destiny has ganged up against us,? he said.

 The residents of Kashmir, once a paradise on earth, are living through a nightmare.

 There has been no electricity for one week and no drinking water in areas where water supply is dependent on power. There is a dearth of cooking gas and kerosene. There are no vegetables or mutton. The Valley, with supplies not forthcoming, presents the picture of a besieged city.

 Kashmiris are shivering in the bone-chilling cold in houses engulfed in darkness with no power to heat their homes or light their lamps.

 The avalanches swept away four vital electric transmission towers ? set up across the Pir Panjal ranges ? through which electricity was supplied to the Valley. The authorities have said it would take at least three more weeks to completely restore electric supply.

 ?We are doing our best. Our engineers are trying to reach the heights on the Pir Panjal mountains from where the towers had been washed away by avalanches. It will take more time,? said Shoukat Rashid Wani, the chief engineer, maintenance, of Kashmir. 

 ?It is for the first time in our lives that we are facing such problems,? Wani told reporters.

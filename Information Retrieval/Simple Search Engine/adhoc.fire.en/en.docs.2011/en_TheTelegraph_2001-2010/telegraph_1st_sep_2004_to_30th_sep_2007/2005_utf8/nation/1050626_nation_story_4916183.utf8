 Maneka cry

 Nagpur/Chandigarh, June 25: Maneka Gandhi today demanded the arrest of Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and the others accused in the black-buck killing case, saying the Jhajjar court that released them on bail was not empowered to do so.

 Speaking to reporters in Nagpur today, the animal rights activist also accused Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh of sheltering the mafia gang.

 In Chandigarh, People For Animals activist Naresh Kadyan echoed Maneka. There is a bond that exists among former kings and princes in the country and they continue to help each other, he alleged.

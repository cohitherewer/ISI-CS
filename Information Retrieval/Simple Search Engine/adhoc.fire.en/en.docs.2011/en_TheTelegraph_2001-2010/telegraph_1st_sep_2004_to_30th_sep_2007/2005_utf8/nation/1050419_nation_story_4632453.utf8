 Cocktail drama in blasts trial

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Chennai, April 18: The special court probing the 1998 Coimbatore blasts saw high drama after five persons accused in the case demanded ?judgment? today before being escorted out in a state of near collapse for drinking a heady brew.

 Top police sources said over phone from Coimbatore that the five, before coming to the court, had consumed a cocktail that had ingredients like soap water, mosquito coil and a white powder used to incapacitate ants.

 The sources said the five ? their names were not revealed by Coimbatore police for security reasons ? had consumed the brew this morning under the pretext of going to the jail hospital. Later, after they had shuffled unsteadily into the courtroom, they created a stir by shouting at the judge. ?Either deliver the judgment today itself,? they cried, ?or else let us face the police guns?.

 While being brought to the court, the five had told an intelligence official that they had consumed the brew. ?We immediately brought this to the judge?s notice, who ordered that all the five be removed to hospital at once,? a police source said.

 The sources said the five had somehow managed to prepare the brew surreptitiously inside the jail though the prison does not usually have stock of the substances they used. They also consumed anti-depressant tablets. Late this evening, the sources added, all five were recovering at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital.

 The outburst in the court, however, pointed to the need for completing the trial quickly as seven years have passed since the blasts killed over 60 people in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, though BJP chief L.K. Advani, the target, had a narrow escape. The bombs exploded near the venue of a public meeting Advani was to address minutes before he arrived. In all, 161 persons had been chargesheeted.

 Police officials said the five are among those at the tail end of the chargesheet and, being ?in the fringe?, want to know their fate immediately. But they added that the trial has dragged on because several of the accused have not cooperated with investigators.

 The case had been mired in a procedural controversy for some years as a section of the accused wanted the ?case to be split?. But the court rejected the plea recently. Another group among the accused wanted as many as 60 witnesses to be re-examined, but the judge consented to re-examine only 10.

 Sources said today?s developments ?jolted? the prosecution and the police for a brief while. The trial will resume on April 25.

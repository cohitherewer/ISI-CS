 New Delhi, Jan. 14: The tsunami-affected tribals in Andaman and Nicobar Islands want to build their houses themselves and only expect the government to help with money and raw materials like timber and bamboo.

 Union tribal affairs minister P.R. Kyndiah, who returned to the capital yesterday after visiting the affected islands, said the tribals did not favour the government constructing homes for them. 

 Kyndiah today said he has already contacted the governments of Bengal and Kerala for supplying timber and bamboo to the affected islands. 

 The Supreme Court has recently eased a ban on cutting trees in the Andamans to meet the need for urgent reconstruction.

 Kyndiah said people belonging to various aboriginal tribes in the islands were safe though some tribes, including the Nicobarese, Sentinelese and the Shompens, were hit hard by the tsunami. ?All tribes, including the Onges, Sentinelese and the Jarwas, in the islands are safe. There is no question of extinction of any tribe.?

 The minister pointed out that the government had already ?fine-tuned and streamlined the entire relief operation in the islands?. 

 The target would be to rehabilitate the affected people before the onset of monsoon by end April.

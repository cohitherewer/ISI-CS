 Blanket scam heat on Laloo

patna: The BJP on Wednesday unveiled 

yet another scam ? this one worth over Rs 40 crore ? and charged that Rashtriya 

Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav, the then de facto ruler of 

Bihar, knew about the siphoning of money meant to purchase blankets for the poor 

affected by the 2003 cold wave, reports our correspondent. 

 The fodder for BJP vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi was provided by a letter written by Bihar State Financial Corporation managing director Amita Paul, whose recommendation for a vigilance investigation into the matter was ignored by the then RJD government headed by Rabri Devi, the wife of Laloo Prasad.

 Modi released copies of the letter written by Paul to the industries secretary wherein she has highlighted the irregularities committed in the purchase of blankets through Bihar State Export Corporation.

 Coming after fodder, bitumen, dhoti-sari and the flood relief swindles, this is only one in a series of scams committed during the 15 years of the RJDs rule. The total number of scams would add up to over two dozen. The conduit for the latest swindle was a Panipat-based man Vinay Garg, who is as infamous as Santosh Jha, the kingpin of the flood relief swindle, he said.

 The letter stated that procedures stipulated for the purchase of official supplies appear to have been violated by the export corporation which placed the order without inviting tenders. The letter pertains only to the Patna district for the supply of 1,13,216 blankets.

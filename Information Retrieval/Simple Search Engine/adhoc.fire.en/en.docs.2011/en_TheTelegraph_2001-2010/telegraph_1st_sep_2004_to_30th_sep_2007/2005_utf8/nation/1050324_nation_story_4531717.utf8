 Hawk signal in Pak snub

 Geelani: Sulking

New Delhi, March 23: Separatist leader S.A.S. Geelani stayed away from Pakistan?s National Day celebrations in Delhi this evening, in a signal to Islamabad that he cannot be taken for granted.

 This is the first time the hardliner has given the event a miss since the early nineties when he came to lead the separatist strain in Kashmir?s politics. 

 An analyst in North Block said: ?He is trying to send a signal that he could not be expected to walk along with Pakistan in the direction that Islamabad was going.?

 Before flying to the capital over the weekend, Geelani had instructed members of his breakaway Hurriyat Conference not to attend the Pakistan National Day celebrations. 

 Yesterday, he lambasted Islamabad for opening the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route, which he considers a virtual acceptance of the Line of Control as the permanent border between the two countries and ?part of India?s agenda?.

 The Tehrik Hurriyat Conference, which Geelani heads, blamed Pakistan for sprinkling salt ?on our wounds? and argued that the ongoing peace initiatives were ?aimed at giving a burial to our prolonged struggle for securing the right of self-determination?. 

 The cricket and hockey series, he added, was an insult to the ongoing jihad in Kashmir. 

 Geelani has also been uncomfortable with Islamabad?s assurances to moderate Hurriyat leaders like Mirwaiz Omar Farooq and Abdul Ghani Bhat at a dinner meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz last year that it treats both leaders on a par.

 Both Mirwaiz and Bhat were present at the celebrations this evening. 

 Geelani believes it is he, and not the moderates, who represents the popular Kashmiri sentiment and deserves Pakistan?s full support.

 Officials said Geelani?s decision to stay away represents a major shift in Kashmiri separatist politics. 

 Delhi has been hinting that Geelani has lost some of his value for Islamabad that wants to be seen as flexible. It is willing to reach a negotiated settlement but does not want to alienate pro-Pakistan elements in Kashmir.

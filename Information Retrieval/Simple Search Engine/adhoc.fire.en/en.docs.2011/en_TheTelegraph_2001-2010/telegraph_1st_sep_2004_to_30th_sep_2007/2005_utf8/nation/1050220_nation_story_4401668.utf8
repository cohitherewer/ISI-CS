 De?s Spouse turns mega-hit 

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Feb. 19: Is marriage hotter than sex?

 At the box-office, it would be called a mega-hit. Shobhaa De has done it again, and this time broken her own record. In the Indian English writing market, where a title is considered successful when 5,000 copies are sold, De?s latest, titled Spouse: The Truth About Marriage, has sold 10,000 copies in three days, says her publisher Penguin Books India.

 ?All her recent books have crossed the 10,000-copy mark in the first year of publication. This one has done it again, with one difference. It?s crossed the 10,000 copies mark in just three days,? gushes Thomas Abraham, president, Penguin Books India.

 But more dramatic, perhaps, is her choice of subject. In Spouse, her 14th book, De, whose previous bestsellers are accused of being soaked in sex, dispenses advice on this most traditional, conservative and ancient, of institutions.

 What made her do it? ?The idea was mine. The publishers agreed with my point of view, which is that modern marriage in all its complexity needs to be examined,? says De.

 ?I have wanted to write on marriage for a long time, since I believe the institution has undergone more of a change in the past 10 years than through all the centuries put together. I have used my own marriage as a reference point to illustrate what I am saying,? she adds.

 ?The book is very much an endorsement of marriage. It is the point of view of a believer,? says De. ?There are two things in life that are non-negotiable ? marriage and motherhood,? she adds.

 Though she objects strongly to the suggestion that her books have a high sex drive ? ?Why is everybody hooked on the sexual content of my novels? Only four have any sexual content, explicit or suggested? ? she explains sex and marriage are obviously not contradictory. ?Sex is a vital component in marriage, but not the only one. Good sex is essentially about good communication. And good communication is what defines a stable marriage,? she says.

 In the book, she talks about the problems contemporary urban couples face: lack of time, compatibility in bed, the man-woman power equation ? and suggests remedies. ?In all this struggle to achieve equality in the bedroom, something very vital gives ? romance and tenderness. You can?t achieve sexual harmony by maintaining a scorecard and giving marks. You can?t view sex as a shopping list with ?must buys? that have to be ticked off.?

 It is to be seen how many buy her advice, but the big numbers also seem to indicate another big picture about Indian publishing. That there is the feeling that there is a huge growing market for popular reading, predominantly English, and that it is aiming at mass appeal and is not at all shy of thinking of itself absolutely in terms of statistics, business and brands.

 It is evident in the terms of reference that Penguin uses for De. ?(She) can arguably stake a claim to almost single-handedly creating the Indian mass market segment and emerging as its strongest brand,? says Abraham.

 ?India is finally seeing mass market publishing coming into its own. Spouse was thus originated in A format (the handy international 4.25 inches x 7 inches). Penguin is reissuing her backlist in A format starting with her best-selling novels that have together sold over a staggering 1,00,000 copies,? adds Abraham.

 And columnist Suhel Seth awards De the finest title: ?Shobhaa De is the Shahrukh Khan of advertising.?

 Not Penguin and De alone. Other publishing houses are also crunching numbers more than ever before. Rupa and Co., in fact, claims that it also has a winner in its stable that sold 12,000 copies in 48 hours: Five Points Someone by Chetan Bhagat, a racy novel on life at IIT.

 So do books count as FMCG? Kapish G. Mehra, publisher, Rupa and Co., who stresses on the ?high quality? of editorial content of his successful books, doesn?t quite think so. But he also has figures to flaunt. ?In one year, Chetan Bhagat?s Five Points Someone has sold 1,20,000 copies. Anurag Mathur?s book The Inscrutable Americans, since it was published 12 years ago, has sold 2.5 lakhs. We recently awarded them the Publisher?s Recognition Award from Rupa. We presented Mathur with Rs 1.5 lakh and Bhagat with Rs 1 lakh..? he says.

 He says though the market has been steadily increasing over 12 years, the growth rate in reflected in volumes has been sharp in the past two years. It is reflected in the number of titles that are being printed, too.

 ?In ?90, we used to bring out about 30 to 40 titles a year. Now, we publish about 200 to 250 books a year. Last month alone, we launched 12 books on management,? he says.

 If those were the processed numbers, this week alone in Mumbai there were two books that could be classified as interesting products. There was The Luminous Sparks by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, described as a ?deluxe? edition of poems and biographical notes with ?inspired visuals?. And there was the book launched by another brand, television icon Jassi, called Jassi?s 7 Steps to Success, a self-help book.

 De herself has no problem with ?branding?.

 ?We live in ?branded? times ? every ?product? has its own position in the market. I am extremely comfortable with the tag (of being the SRK of publishing). Shahrukh Khan is one of the our biggest superstars, often referred to as a phenomenon, for his ability to create box office history. I am flattered to be in the same bracket in publishing terms. Who doesn?t want to break existing records and create history?? she asks.

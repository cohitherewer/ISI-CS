 India, UK head for open skies

 Bangalore, April 4: British officials will meet their Indian counterparts later this month to give final touches to an open-sky policy between the nations, British high commissioner Sir Michael Arthur said today, reports our special correspondent.

 Talking to reporters on the sidelines of an Indo-UK workshop on stem cell research, he said the British government favoured an open-sky policy with India. 

 ?Representatives of both the governments are meeting in New Delhi later this month to finalise an open-sky policy between the two countries. Meanwhile, we have agreed to increase the number of flights to India to 41 a week from this summer from 19 flights a week,? he said.

 An open-sky policy would help the three British airlines ? British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and British Midland ? to operate more flights to India and launch new services to cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kochi. 

 British Airways now operates services to Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, while Virgin Atlantic launched its London-Mumbai service last week.

 On multiple entry visas to Indians, Sir Arthur said the British government expected the number of permits to go up by 30 per cent this year.

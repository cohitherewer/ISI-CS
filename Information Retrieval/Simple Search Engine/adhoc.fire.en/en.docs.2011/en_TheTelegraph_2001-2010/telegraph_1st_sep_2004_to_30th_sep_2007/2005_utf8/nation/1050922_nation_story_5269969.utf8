 US frees Lashkar supporter on bail

 Alexandria (AP): A third-grade teacher 

 in Maryland, accused of supporting a Pakistan-based terrorist 

 group and awaiting trial, has been freed on bond despite 

 objections from prosecutors who fear he will flee the country.

 Ali Asad Chandia, who was freed on Tuesday under electronic monitoring, was indicted last week and charged with providing material support to Lashkar-e-Toiba. 

 Chandia was trained in document forgery and as a Pakistani citizen, he could easily obtain a new passport and flee to Pakistan, the prosecutors said.

 The charges against him stem from a government investigation of what the prosecutors called a Virginia Jehad Network, a group of young Muslim men who used paintball games in 2000 and 2001 as paramilitary training for holy war around the globe.

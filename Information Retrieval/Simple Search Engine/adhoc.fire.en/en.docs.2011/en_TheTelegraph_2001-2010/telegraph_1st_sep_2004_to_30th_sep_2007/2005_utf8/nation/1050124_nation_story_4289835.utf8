 Letters from Netaji

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Bhubaneswar, Jan 23: The Netaji Subhas Birthplace 

Museum in the Oriya Bazar locality of Cuttack today added some rare letters written 

by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose to its collection.

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik dedicated the museum to the nation at a function this evening. 

 The state government acquired the building in 1954. Following a partial conversion of the heritage building, the museum was formally inaugurated on January 23 last year. 

 The museum had so far been housed in only two of the 25 rooms of the building. Lucknow-based Indian Council of Conservation Institute, which was in charge of the design, development and implementation of the upgradation project, finished the renovation of some of the other rooms yesterday. 

 Secretary of the museum B.K. Rath said eight more galleries have been added to the museum. 

 While in one room the official chamber of Netaji?s father Janakinath Bose has been recreated, another gallery features pictures on the life of the freedom fighter.

 The museum has structured information on the life of Netaji, an innovative display system, advanced security system, state-of-the-art lighting arrangements, CCTV and a hi-tech alarm system. 

 The renovation project included restoration of the main building, development of the birthplace museum and landscaping.

 Twenty-two rare letters written by Netaji have also been put up for display museum. The letters, stumbled upon by state archaeology department officials while cleaning the huge double-storeyed building, shed light on several aspects of Netaji?s character.

 The letters do not have much political content and instead focus more on Netaji?s personal life.

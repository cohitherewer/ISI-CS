 Gaur gimmick for better work

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, June 8: Want to rise above your co-workers? Sing Vande Mataram.

 The louder the better.

 After espousing a cow-based economy and declaring some cities holy, the BJP-led Madhya Pradesh government has taken another first-of-its-kind step ? all employees across the state would have to sing the national song at least once a month from July 1.

 According to chief minister Babulal Gaur, choral singing would inculcate patriotic feeling among the babus, which in turn would ensure punctuality, sense of duty, honesty and commitment.

 But the babus will not be the only ones to flex their vocal chords. From now on, all cabinet meetings ? and, of course, government functions ? would start with Vande Mataram.

 Sources in the department of general administration said a circular would be issued directing employees to assemble in groups on the first day of every month to sing Vande Mataram. Unauthorised absence would result in punitive action, the sources said.

 Gaur has also introduced a dress code for government employees ? black trousers and white shirt for men and cotton saris for women. All officials, including the chief secretary, are expected to wear badges displaying their name and rank.

 However, a section of the bureaucracy has been resisting the move. On Monday, the state-run directorate of small-scale industries rejected the kosa print saris that had been purchased for its women employees on the ground that they were sub-standard.

 Gaurs insistence on Vande Mataram has caused anxiety among the bureaucrats and ministers. Barring a handful, few remember it beyond the opening stanza. But there is no getting away because the chief minister has ordered the general administration department to provide a copy of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyays work along with the English translation by Aurobindo Ghosh.

 If the babus are nervous, the Opposition feels the move is absurd. 

 I ask him one simple thing. Why is he indulging in gimmicks? said Jamuna Devi, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly.

 The cabinet is supposed to debate and discuss policy matters. It is not a forum to sing Vande Mataram. Similarly, government employees should do their work instead of singing patriotic songs. It is absurd, the state Congress leader added.

 But Gaur is determined and even explains why. Instead of spending time flattering your bosses, you should start working, he told a group of employees, urging them to remember the spirit behind Vande Mataram. Incompetent employees were the main reason behind Digvijay Singhs failure.

 The chief minister followed up the dig at the previous Congress regime with a scathing criticism of government employees who, he said, are merely 3 per cent of the population but corner 65 per cent of the resources, leaving just 35 per cent for development works. 

 The words came as a shock to leaders of employees unions who were jostling for space to be photographed with Gaur. Politicians, contractors and government employees are responsible for the sorry state of affairs, he continued. 

 If a politician is corrupt and does not work, people set him aside in elections. But a person in a government job is immune for 30 years.

 Sleeping dogs scare Sunjay

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Sunjay Dutt

 Mumbai, Nov. 12: If Abu Salem sings, Sunjay Dutt might face the music.

 A day after the fugitive dons hyped-up arrival in Mumbai from Portugal, Bollywoods original bad boy quietly slipped into the city from a month-long hunting vacation in Tanzania.

 Salem and Dutt are on the list of those accused of conspiring to carry out ? or carrying out ? the 1993 Bombay blasts that killed 257 people and injured hundreds.

 Two months before the blasts, Dutt allegedly received AK-56 rifles, hand grenades and some other ammunition from Salem and another accused, Baba Musa, at his bungalow in Bandras Pali Hill. Salem later took away two of the AK-56 rifles and all the hand grenades.

 This is the police version of the events based on Musas confession (since retracted in court):

 On January 16, 1993, Salem, Musa and a businessman named Sameer Hingora came to Dutts bungalow in a Maruti van between 7 and 7.30 am. Salem opened a secret chamber in the car and took out three AK-56 rifles, 15 to 20 hand grenades and some other ammunition.

 Dutt said he needed only one rifle, so Salem promised to take back the rest after a few days. The actor asked that the weapons be kept in Hingoras car for two to three days, by which time he would find a safe place to hide the stuff.

 On January 31 evening, Salem and an accomplice returned to Dutts bungalow to take back the weapons Dutt didnt want. Salem left them at the home of a woman called Zaibunnisa Anwar Kazi, another Bombay blasts accused.

 With the police hot on his heels, Salem soon escaped to Dubai with Dawood. But a police raid on Dutts home led to the discovery and seizure of the AK-56. The actor was charged under the anti-terror law, Tada, for illegal possession of the gun and put behind bars.

 He managed to step out of jail allegedly after his actor-MP father Sunil contacted Shiv Sena boss Bal Thackeray, a political opponent, and cut a deal. The actor has since then, by all accounts, steered clear of his underworld acquaintances, but Salems arrest may bring back the ghost of many unanswered questions to haunt him.

 Of the four characters in the drama, Salem was the only one the police hadnt been able to lay their hands on so far. Dutt, Musa and Hingora had all made confessions during questioning but retracted them in court, weakening the case against them.

 If Salem begins to talk ? as the CBI sleuths believe he will ? it might spell trouble for the Bollywood hunk. And theres no Sunil Dutt now to turn to for advice or help.

 The timing of the extradition couldnt be worse for the actor. His sister Priya is fighting a by-election for the seat left vacant by their fathers death. The polls are slated for November 19, and Dutt was to hit the campaign trail with his Bollywood friends starting today.

 Salems arrest, however, has put paid to the plan. The actor today stayed huddled with close friends and Priyas political strategists to work out ways of fielding the uncomfortable questions the media are bound to ask.

 That Dutt is scared is clear. He kept calling film-maker Mahesh Bhatt from Tanzania, seeking help, ever since the news of Salems extradition broke.

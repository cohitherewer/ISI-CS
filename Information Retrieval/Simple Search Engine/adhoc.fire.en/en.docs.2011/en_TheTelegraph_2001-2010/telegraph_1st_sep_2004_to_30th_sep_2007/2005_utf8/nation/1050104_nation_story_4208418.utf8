 Cong caught in ticket rush 

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Jan. 3: The crowds or the lack of them outside party offices tell their own story with just seven days left for filing of nominations for the first phase of the February 3 polls in Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana.

 The BJP headquarters at 11 Ashoka Road here wear a deserted look despite elections being so close and the stakes so high for L.K. Advani, who took over as party chief from M. Venkaiah Naidu recently.

 In contrast, the AICC office at 24 Akbar Road has been under siege from ticket-seekers. The crowds have been unmanageable over the last four days. Riot police had to be called in to keep ticket seekers, especially those from neighbouring Haryana, in check.

 The media visiting the Congress headquarters for the daily briefing needed their identity cards and the help of guards to make their way in.

 Rows of flashy cars lined Akbar Road, with the unusually large crowd of ticket seekers from Haryana being seen as a sign that the Congress will be able to form a government in the state, what with former National Democratic Alliance partners ? the ruling Indian National Lok Dal and the BJP ? going their separate ways.

 Jittery over a possible Janata Dal (United)-Lok Janashakti Party-Congress alliance, BJP vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi publicly announced on Sunday that the BJP had authorised senior Dal (U) leader Nitish Kumar to have talks with LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan.

 Party insiders said this statement might help the RJD but is a ploy to stop the Dal (U) from having any electoral understanding with the Congress via the LJP. The BJP brass is worried over Kumar?s overtures to the Congress.

 Modi?s assertion has created confusion in the minds of Congress, LJP and Muslim voters that Kumar is in reality an agent of BJP.

 Paswan today had to convene a news conference to allay the fears of the Congress and Muslims that he might have a clandestine arrangement with the NDA.

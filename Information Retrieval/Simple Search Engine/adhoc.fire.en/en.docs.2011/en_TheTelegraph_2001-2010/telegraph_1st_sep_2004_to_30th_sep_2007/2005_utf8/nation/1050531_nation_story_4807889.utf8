 Asean support for Security Council bid

 KAY BENEDICT

 Vientiane (Laos), May 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs Look East policy has started gathering steam with more and more countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations acknowledging Indias pre-eminence in the region and supporting Delhis claim for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.

 Some countries would back Indias candidature for a seat in the Security Council though Asean will not vote as a block, according to sources in political and diplomatic circles. 

 Myanmar and Laos said they would back India. Japan, a dialogue partner of Asean like India, is also making a bid for the council.

 We recognise the growing and active role of India in major international economic and political affairs in the United Nations, its agencies and other multilateral fora, said an Asean diplomat.

 We appreciate (the) friendship with India and are delighted with New Delhis cooperation in the Asean. After your Prime Ministers visit to (the) Asean summit last year, Asean-India and India-Laos (relations) received a boost, said Kheckeo Soisaya, the vice-minister for information and culture of Laos.

 Last years Asean-India summit and car rally have improved relations with countries of Southeast Asia. The rally, which was witnessed by leaders of 15 countries, including Singh, boosted the scope for enhanced trade, road transport and connectivity, investment, tourism and people-to-people links between Asean countries and India, captains of industry told visiting Indian journalists.

 The Laos summit helped Asean take full advantage of the geographical proximity of Southeast Asia and India to synergise the strengths of the two economic regions to act as powerful engines of growth.

 Government sources in Yangon felt there is need for synergy between Indias Look East policy and Myanmars Look Around policy that focuses on strengthening ties with neighbours, adding that Yangon favoured a robust expansion in economic ties with India.

 The Asean region of 10 countries ? excluding summit and dialogue partners India, China, Japan and South Korea ? has a population of about 500 million, a total area of 4.5 million sq km, a combined gross domestic product of $737 billion and total trade of $720 billion.

 Leaders of Southeast Asia have, with the aim of strengthening regional cooperation, focused on facilitating greater interaction between the media of the region and India to reduce gaps in information. The Asean-India Parliamentarians Forum has been set up to provide for regular interaction.

 Organising Asean-India games has also been a priority, as has promoting interoperability and interconnectivity of national telecommunications equipment and services.

 The building of trans-Asean energy networks has also been in focus.

 High priority has been accorded to the development of regional infrastructure and road, rail, sea and air transportation links to increase physical connectivity that would facilitate greater movement of goods and people.

 Besides, the Asean Free-Trade Area is set to be implemented by 2011. The strategic objective of the body is to increase the Asean regions competitive edge as a single production unit and create an East Asian community on the lines of the European Union.

 The bonhomie would strengthen and expand cooperation to combat money laundering, drug trafficking, cyber crimes, international economic crimes and piracy at sea.

 Asean and India cooperate closely in opposing the threat of weapons of mass destruction and on disarmament with the objective of totally eliminating such weapons, including those with nuclear capability.

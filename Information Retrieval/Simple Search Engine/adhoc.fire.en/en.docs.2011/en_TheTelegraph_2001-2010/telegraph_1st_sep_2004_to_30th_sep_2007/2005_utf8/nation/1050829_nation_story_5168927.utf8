 New Delhi, Aug. 28: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has decided to inform the Supreme Court that there is no ground to shut down Islamic courts and that they are not in conflict with the judicial system or the constitutional framework. 

 The law board, in its emergency meeting here today, decided it would approach Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi to garner support for the Islamic or shariat courts.

 The meeting was called after the Supreme Court issued the law board, the Centre, several states and the Dar-ul Uloom seminary in Deoband notices on a PIL seeking a ban on Islamic courts. 

 Muslim law board spokesperson Abdul Rahim Qureshi said though they have not received the court notices yet, the matter was sensitive enough to warrant serious attention, especially in the wake of misconceptions about the Islamic courts. 

 The board is upset with law minister Hans Raj Bhardwaj, who said no parallel judicial system like the shariat courts would be allowed to function in the country. 

 The law board wants to lobby Sonia and Singh as the law ministers statement has confused its members about the governments stand. The Muslim body badly wants the government to support the shariat courts before the Supreme Court.

 Today, the law board approved the setting up of a committee to deal with the controversy regarding the shariat courts and clear the confusion about their functioning. 

 It will include ulemas, experts in Islamic jurisprudence and lawyers. Maulana Wali Rehmani, Maulana Rabe Hasan Nadvi, Maulana Atiq Bastwi, Maulana Jalaluddin Hussain and lawyers Zafaryab Jilani and Yusuf Hatim Muchchala will be in the committee.

 Muchchala said the arguments raised in the PIL against the shariat courts would be refuted point by point. 

 It is most unfortunate that the law minister should have branded the shariat courts a parallel judicial system. Their functioning is totally in accordance with the constitutional framework. They perform an important function as part of the alternative dispute resolution mechanism that is encouraged not only in India but all over the world. Arent commercial disputes settled through arbitration? 

 In fact, it is advisable that you should go in for arbitration. The dar-ul-qaza provide an important platform to people to settle their disputes without burdening the courts with their squabbles, Muchchala, a lawyer practising in Mumbai, said.

 The board has also decided to request the Uttar Pradesh government to club all cases related to the Babri Masjid demolition, including the alleged involvement of BJP chief L.K. Advani, for trial in a single court. 

 We have passed a resolution and decided to request chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav to issue a notification so that all Babri demolition cases could be taken to the CBI court in Lucknow and that the cases be tried there accordingly, assistant general secretary Abdul Rehman Qureshi said.

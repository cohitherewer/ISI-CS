 Basu utters home truths, party listens

 New Delhi, April 9: Jyoti Basu today scotched speculation that the CPM will withdraw support from the UPA government.

 He, in fact, went a step ahead and said the CPM needs the Congress as much as it needs the CPM. ?We will behave in a way that the UPA government can last a full term,? said Basu after releasing a book of memoirs of 25 communist freedom fighters at the party congress.

 The veteran leader pointed out that the political situation has changed. ?We saw what happened when the NDA government was in power.? In the new context, there can be no one-way traffic, he said. ?The Congress is dependent on us as we are on them.?

 Basu also advised both the CPM and the Congress to have ?patience? as ?it is only one year since the UPA government has come to power?.

 His comments are significant as they reflect the mood of the majority of delegates at the party congress, though the Marxist leader has not always been able to carry his party with him. 

 Basu and CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet had been in a minority on important issues like participation in a government at the Centre.

 Prakash Karat, who will succeed Surjeet at the end of the congress, said: ?There is much wider acceptance of the party line at this congress than there was at the earlier Hyderabad congress.? 

 The CPM?s tactics will be to protest against the government?s ?anti-people? economic policies in and outside Parliament, but not to an extent that would threaten its survival. 

 The party will, therefore, continue to walk a tightrope for the next three years till its next congress, if not for another four years when the UPA?s term comes to an end. The strategy will be delicately poised between ?barking? and not ?biting?.

 ?We have told them (the Congress) we will raise questions in Parliament but we do not want your government to fall,? said Basu. ?We have told them that the government should last for five years. That can only happen if they carry out the common minimum programme (CMP),? he stressed.

 The Left wants to be perceived as the agent of change that will benefit poor people. Party leaders believe they have a ?great? opportunity to expand their support base outside Bengal and Kerala.

 The commitments made in the CMP are, therefore, a key issue. ?The only thing we want this government to do is to implement the CMP,? said Basu.

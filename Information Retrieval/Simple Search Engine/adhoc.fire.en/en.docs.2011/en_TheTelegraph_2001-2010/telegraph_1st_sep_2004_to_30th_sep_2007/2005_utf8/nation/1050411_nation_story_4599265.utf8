 Stampede no bar to Tandon bash

 Lucknow, April 10: A year after the sari tragedy rocked the BJP?s poll boat, Lalji Tandon will be back at the Chadrashekhar Azad Park here to celebrate his birthday on Tuesday. 

 Last year, at the same venue, 26 women and a child were killed in a stampede while scrambling to collect free saris being distributed on the occasion of the BJP leader?s birthday. 

 The party?s image had taken a beating as the incident happened weeks before the general elections and that, too, in Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s own constituency. Tandon was the former Prime Minister?s election manager.

 Like all earlier birthday bashes, the cutouts of Tandon are back and the park is abuzz with activity. White shamianas, chairs and expensive flower decorations have been ordered. 

 But there are no saris this time. 

 Apart from this change, the birthday plans are the same. 

 Neither would Tandon listen to suggestions from party seniors who advised that the park should be left alone and Tandon should organise the birthday bash elsewhere. 

 The leaders regretted that not even a condolence plaque, having names of the sari tragedy victims, had been built in the park.

 Like previous years, this time, too, there will be a kavi samellan , a bhajan sandhya and a blood donation camp. The programme would be organised by Mahanagar Vikas Samiti, a front of the BJP. 

 A member of the samiti said it would send saris this time to tsunami victims. ?Saris have always been there. It will be here this time. But instead of distributing them here we would send this to women rendered homeless by the tsunami,? he said. 

 Tandon wants to make a point by organising the birthday bash at the same place. ?Why should he change the venue when for last 10 years he has been organising the programme here?? asked an associate of the BJP leader and a youth leader.

 Tandon appears to be looking forward to the event. ?Don?t make a mistake. It is not like another birthday bash. I always want my associates to take up social causes on the occasion of my birthday and this will be done,? he told journalists today.

 ?I regret last year?s incident. It was unfortunate and accidental. But I also condemn the way my political enemies had played football over that,? he said.

 Tandon was slapped a chargesheet last month before the subdivisional judicial magistrate?s court. 

 While in the first chargesheet his name did not figure, in the new one, Tandon, along with two others, was accused of ?trying to influence voters in favour of BJP candidate and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?. 

 The two other accused ? Brajendra Murari Yadav and Manoj Singh ? were organisers of the birthday function. Yadav and Singh are members of the Nagrik Seva Samiti, an outfit affiliated to the BJP. Both are organisers of this year?s programme too.

 They have been charged under section 171B of IPC with bribing voters.

 The police are also not taking any chances. After the samiti filed an application with the Mahanagar police for permission last week, the cops have told the office bearers to furnish details of the programme. 

 ?We are deploying more police officials and we will ask the samiti to stick to its announced programme,? said Kamal Yadav, officer in-charge of Mahanagar police station.

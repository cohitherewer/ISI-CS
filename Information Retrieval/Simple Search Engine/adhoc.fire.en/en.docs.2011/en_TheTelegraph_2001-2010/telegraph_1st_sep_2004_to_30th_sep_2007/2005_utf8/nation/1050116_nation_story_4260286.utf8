 Ocean shield on US radar

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Jan. 15: Even 

 as the White House yesterday announced plans to extend its 

 tsunami warning system to the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean 

 Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, the US is holding separate talks 

 with India, Indonesia and Thailand to extend the cover of 

 the system to the Indian Ocean.

 The talks are being held within the framework of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), a US-led international body of which India is a member. 

 GEOSS is to hold a ministerial meeting in Brussels on February 16, at which a strategic action plan prepared jointly by 15 federal US agencies on behalf of the White House will be presented. India is to attend the meeting.

 Simultaneously, Unesco, the UN agency tasked with the responsibility of creating a global system for tsunami warning, yesterday revised its target date for making such a system operational to June 2007, the organisation?s director-general, Koichiro Matsuura, said at a news conference.

 He had earlier told an international meeting on small island developing states in Mauritius that the system could be set up in 18 months.

 The revision came after talks with participants at the conference, at which India is represented by its permanent representative to the UN, Nirupam Sen.

 Matsuura hoped, however, that the Indian Ocean component of the global system could be in place by June next year. ?The estimated cost of the scientific infrastructure for the Indian Ocean system with a regional centre and properly equipped national centres is about $30 million,? Matsuura said. 

 ?The annual maintenance costs of a regional centre would probably be in the order of one to two million dollars.?

 The urgency of tsunami warning in Asia has become a priority in Washington and the meeting on small island developing states provided an opportunity to thrash out issues that stood in the way of translating that urgency into action.

 At the meeting, Thailand?s vice-minister for foreign affairs Sorajak Kasemsuvan offered to incorporate the task of the Indian Ocean warning system into the activities of the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre that already exists in Bangkok.

 He said Thailand would take the initiative to host a ministerial meeting in Phuket within a fortnight to discuss procedures for creating the warning system. 

 African countries affected by December?s tsunami are also to be invited for this meeting and to join the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre, the continent?s primary disaster reduction agency.

 Meanwhile, Unesco will organise two meetings of experts in March to work out exactly what will be required for a global alert system and to scientifically analyse the Asian tsunami in that perspective. The experts will also harmonise all international efforts being made towards the establishment of the Indian Ocean warning system.

 Plans for the Indian Ocean component would be finalised at the annual meeting of Unesco?s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission in June, Matsuura said. 

 US plans to extend its early warning system to the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, announced yesterday by John Marburger, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, will cost $37.5 million in the next two years.

 Under the plan, 25 buoys would be added to the existing six deep-sea detection buoys and other sensors designed to warn north America?s west coast.

 The addition will warn southwestern Pacific of tsunamis for the first time.

 Muslims cheer PM clean chit

 Washington/New Delhi, July 21 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has asserted that not a single Indian Muslim had joined the al Qaida or Taliban, drawing expressions of gratitude from the community.

 Singh told CNN in Washington yesterday that he took pride in the fact that although India has 150 million Muslims, not one has been found to have joined the ranks of al Qaida or participated in the activities of the Taliban.

 Leading Muslim organisations in India today hailed Singh for his faith and confidence in the community.

 Last nights historical statement by the Prime Minister? has evoked overwhelming appreciation and gratification in the community all over the country, representatives of Muslim organisations said in a joint statement in New Delhi.

 The signatories assured Singh that they would never allow terrorism to raise its head and? the integrity, unity, peace and harmony of the country?to be jeopardised by any act of terrorism.

 Singh, however, voiced concern at what might happen if Pakistans nuclear weapons fell in the hands of terrorists.

 There has been reckless proliferation, he said, and there is a danger of extremists seizing power and taking control of the weapons.

 In separate interviews to the Washington Post and CNN, he said Osama bin Laden and his al Qaida network still had a significant base in Pakistan.

 I think there is no doubt about that, Singh said, adding al Qaida was quite active in the tribal belt of the North West Frontier Province. 

 Asked whether he trusts President Pervez Musharraf, Singh said, I do trust. But I think there is an old saying of President (Ronald) Reagan: Trust and verify.

 Teesta 

reports threat calls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Teesta Setalvad

Mumbai, Sept. 14: Teesta Setalvad today registered a formal complaint with Santa Cruz police station regarding the death threats she received over telephone yesterday.

 The social activist received the call on her cellphone around 4 pm when she was travelling to south Mumbai to attend a public hearing on the July 26 deluge by the Citizens Commission. The man was speaking in Hindi. He used sexually abusive language and threatened to kill me if I interfere in the Gujarat riots case, she said.

 Her colleague Raiz Khan, who co-ordinates riot-related work from Ahmedabad, also reported a similar call around 7.30 pm. 

 Raiz telephoned me about the threats and said it was a Baroda number. He has also registered a complaint in Ahmedabad, she said. Gujarat police have sent a team to Vadodara.

 Teesta and her team of activists had petitioned the Supreme Court demanding the transfer of the Best Bakery and other riot cases out of Gujarat to ensure fair trial. The trial in the bakery case was then transferred to Maharashtra.

 The court recently cleared Teesta of charges made by Zahira Sheikh, the main witness in the bakery case who turned hostile and accused her former mentor of tutoring her to implicate innocent people.

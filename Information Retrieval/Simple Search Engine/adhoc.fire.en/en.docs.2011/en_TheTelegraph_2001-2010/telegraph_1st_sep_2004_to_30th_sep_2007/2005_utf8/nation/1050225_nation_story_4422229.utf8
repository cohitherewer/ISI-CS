 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 24: Police are investigating the death of a 20-year-old woman whose body was found in a Puri hotel on Tuesday.

 On Sunday morning, 25-year-old Rakesh Kumar Gupta from Malda in West Bengal checked into the hotel along with the woman, whom he claimed to be his wife. On Tuesday afternoon, the woman was found dead in her room by the staff. Her companion had left the hotel in the morning.

 According to the police, Gupta telephoned the hotel on Tuesday afternoon to ?inform? that his wife had committed suicide in the room. ?Please don?t inform the police,? he reportedly told the hotel staff.

 Gupta had paid the hotel manager Rs 750 as room rent for three days on Monday night. Before leaving, he locked the room and left with the original keys. 

 A team from Sea Beach police recovered some glass bangles, Rs 50 and an empty bottle from the room. 

 Police sub-inspector Sarita Tripathy said no signs of strangulation were visible on the neck of the deceased.

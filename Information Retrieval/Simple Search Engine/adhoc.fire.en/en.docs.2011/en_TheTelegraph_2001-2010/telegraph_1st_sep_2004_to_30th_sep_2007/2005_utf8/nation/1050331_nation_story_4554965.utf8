 YSR springs Naxalite stick

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reddy: Tough stand

 New Delhi, March 30: Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy is getting ready to wield the stick against Naxalites.

 Although he initiated peace talks with them after winning the crown last May and is making public noises about a second round, his government has quietly endorsed outlawing the Communist Party of India (Maoist).

 Sources said the Andhra home department recently wrote to the Union home ministry saying the state seconded the ban on the CPI (Maoist) under the Centre?s Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.

 The CPI (Maoist) came into being last September after a merger between the People?s War Group and the Maoist Communist Centre. The two groups ? the PWG is the most active in Andhra ? were among 32 outfits banned under the act.

 Despite the ban, the Reddy government had agreed on a ceasefire pact with the Naxalites, leading to the first round of talks last July.

 The current endorsement of the ban comes because Reddy is slowly reconciling himself to the fact that Naxalites have to be confronted as they have resumed their violent ways.

 His regime is reportedly apprehensive that the Naxalites might have used the last nine months of the ceasefire to regroup and acquire more sophisticated weapons. The merger between the PWG and the MCC, active in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa, is being looked on as part of a move to strengthen Naxalite ranks.

 The Centre has routinely sought the views of states on banning the CPI (Maoist). The Union home ministry is understood to have taken a decision on March 19 to outlaw the outfit. The Reddy government?s endorsement of the ban is a setback to efforts at the national level to address the Naxalite problem not as a law and order issue but in a larger socio-economic context.

 No longer a rookie, Rabri finds her voice

 UTTAM SENGUPTA

 Rabri Devi

 Raghopur, Feb. 20: The speech left her audience gasping. 

 The goongi gudiya (dumb doll) of Bihar, as she is described snidely by opponents, floored her constituency by an impassioned plea. 

 ?Raghopur mera ghar hai; ghar me koi kuch mangta hai kya? Hum kuch nahin magenge; sub aap par chhor diye hain; jo karna hai keejiye (This is my home and at home, one does not demand anything; I will not ask for anything; it is all up to you; do what you please,? Rabri Devi, the only woman chief minister of Bihar, has come of age.

 For 12 minutes she spoke extempore at Terasia and gave ample evidence that she has learnt the art of believing in what she says. 

 She started belligerently enough by asking ?who says there has been no development?? but immediately realised that it was not cutting any ice with the people. She then effortlessly changed her track and blamed the NDA government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which did not give Bihar a ?single paisa?. 

 Whatever her government wanted to do, the opponents stalled by getting injunctions from court, Rabri said.

 One moment she would tug at the heart strings: ?I have nothing to give you.? The next moment she would declare with a straight face that everything had been done to deliver electricity to the area. ?The pillars have been put up; they just need to be wired.?

 ?The results will be startling; our government will be sworn in,? she declared and delivered the coup de grace. ?Hum jaat nahin, jamaat lekar chalet hain (I move not with caste but with the crowd).?

 All her opponents, ?Paswan-wa, Nitish-wa and Modi-ya? had lost their mind and the people should drive them away with their brooms (?jharoo markar bhagaiye?).

 Speakers preceding her hail her, for some reason, as the ?Raajmaata? while in the same breath they would remind the audience that she hailed from a family of commoners. Conscious that the constituency is unhappy at her failure to visit them after winning the last election, they seek to assuage feelings by pointing out that she, after all, had to look after the whole state. 

 Rabri has already expressed her regret at her inability to visit them earlier, one of them reminds the people.

 Barely 500 yards away, a group of people nonchalantly goes about their chores. Neither the helicopter nor the presence of a large number of vehicles, policemen and young RJD workers with bandanas generate much excitement.

 Many women among her audience quietly walk out even before she starts speaking. There are indications that all?s not well, though Rabri should have no difficulty in winning the Yadav-dominated constituency. That she is being made to sweat it out is an indication of the pressures on the ruling couple.

 Ram Vilas Paswan?s indiscreet statement that she would lose her deposit in Raghopur has clearly stung the RJD ranks and they are out to ensure that she wins by a handsome margin. 

 ?Khaana-peena to paach saal chalega; par chunav ke din aap sab bina khana khaye, saat baje booth par pahoonchiye (you can eat for the next five years but on polling day, abandon everything and reach the booth at seven in the morning?).

 Conscious of Paswan?s boast of being featured in the Guinness Book of World Records, they exhort people to ensure that Rabri wins by a record margin.

 The presence of as many as four Yadav candidates has queered the pitch somewhat, though Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party complains that Laloo Prasad Yadav has fielded two dummy candidates to divide opposition votes. 

 Sachchidanand Singh, they complain, is the vice-president of the Bengal unit of the RJD and wanted to contest from Lalganj. Denied a ticket by the RJD, he should have contested as an Independent there, they argue, but why is he contesting from here?

 Similarly, the ?naukrani? Manju Devi, the so-called president of the local domestic workers? association, they complain, has been ?imported? from Danapur. But despite such machinations, they seek to convince visitors, the days of the ?maharani? are numbered, trying very hard to convince themselves at the same time.

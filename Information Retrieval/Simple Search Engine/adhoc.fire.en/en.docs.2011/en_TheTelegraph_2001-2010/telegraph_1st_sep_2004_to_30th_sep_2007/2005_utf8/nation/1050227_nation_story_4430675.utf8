 South scoops up the goodies

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb. 26: It always pays to be on 

the right side of the fence, but more so during budgets.

 States ruled by the Congress and its allies have got more than a fair share of the goodies ? be it new trains or other benefits like extensions or increase in frequency. However, Tamil Nadu, Bengal and Assam, which go to polls next year, have also got a fair bit.

 The south seems to be the biggest beneficiary in terms of new trains and related services unlike north India, which usually rules the roost. Three of the four southern states ? Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh ? have Congress governments.

 As many as five new trains have been introduced from Secunderabad in Andhra. These are the Secunderabad-Nanded Express, Secunderabad-Nizamabad passenger, Secunderabad-Bodhan passenger, Secunderabad-Basar passenger and the Secunderabad-Gudur Express.

 New trains have also been introduced between Madgaon and Mangalore, Chennai and Bangalore, Mangalore and Shravanbelagola, Kumbakonam and Thanjavur, Chennai Egmore and Pondicherry, Madurai and Manamadurai and Thanjavur and Thiruvarur.

 New trains introduced in Bengal and Bihar, the railway minister?s home state, include the Muzaffarpur-Howrah Jansadharan Express, Bhagalpur-Malda Town Express and the Ranchi-Lohardaga DMU (after gauge conversion).

 Also important for Bengal is the extension of Calcutta?s circular railway from Princepghat to Majherhat and from Dum Dum to the airport, which are expected to be completed by March 2005. 

 Laloo Prasad Yadav also announced completion of new lines from Kanthi to Digha.

 Frequency of trains have been increased mainly in Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. 

 In Maharashtra, where the Congress is part of the ruling coalition, lines have been doubled between Durg and Nagpur.

 Congress-ruled Assam has got an important new train, which has been introduced in the Guwahati-New Bongaigaon region. For Punjab, also ruled by the Congress, a train has been proposed between Amritsar and Patna.

 Several new trains have been introduced in Tamil Nadu, where ADMK rule could be challenged next year. Minister of state for railways R. Velu is from the DMK.

 Gravy train finds no takers

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Nagapattinam, Jan. 12: Butter chicken in Nagapattinam, anyone? The administration in this tsunami-ravaged district has asked packaged concern to take it easy. It is currently saddled with a trainload of food, medicines and aid from Punjab that it has no space for. 

 Punjab has sent a trainload of relief and volunteers, including cooks, for the thousands who have been displaced by the raging sea but there is little space available to accommodate the affection. 

 So the cooks that Punjab has sent here have been asked to work as manual labour in the rehabilitation effort. ?We have told them that the food they cook is not the food we eat. Likewise, the food we cook may not be palatable to them. So we have requested the aid givers from Punjab to spare the cooks they have sent for physical work,? the chief coordinator of the relief effort here and Tamil Nadu?s rural development secretary Shanta Sheela Nayar said. 

 But there is some relief for the brigade from Punjab. They have been asked to spare some cooks for a langar khana ? community kitchen ? to prepare food that is digestible to them. The langar has been permitted to be set up in the compound of the district collectorate. 

 ?It is a remarkable thing. Some 300 sardarjis have come with all kinds of help for us and we are grateful,? says district collector J. Radhakrishnan. 

 An overflow of concern for Tamil Nadu?s coastal communities has meant that aid and relief is in abundance at least here. This would not be the scene in, say, the Andamans where accessibility is difficult. 

 The cooks that the chief relief coordinator was talking about are part of a 200-strong team from Punjab despatched by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee and an Akali Dal MLA from Patiala?s Samana constituency, Surjit Singh Rakada. 

 The cooks sent by the gurdwara committee would, of course, dish out only vegetarian fare. But nothing symbolises Punjabi cuisine better than butter chicken. For Nagapattinam?s rice eaters, dal-roti is just as alien.

 The special train with 28 wagons and five coaches carried medical teams, cooks and volunteers and reached Tamil Nadu yesterday. Governor Surjit Singh Barnala was here to receive it. So was former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. The train was received at Tiruchi because Nagapattinam railway station is choked. 

 Today, after much thought, the district authorities found parking space for it. Since Nagapattinam had no godowns to spare ? they are actually spilling over with supplies, mostly rice ? the train was parked in a siding at Thanjavur. The relief from the train, worth Rs 5.5 crore, is now being loaded into the godowns of the civil supplies depot there. Rakada said the volunteers would stay as long as required.

 ?There is no question of any non-availability of basics anymore,? says Nayar. 

 At the same time, she makes an appeal for fire extinguishers. With many of the displaced now being moved into interim shelters, it is necessary to equip these camps with essentials. Hurriedly, Nayar also specifies that the administration needs 500 fire extinguishers. Any more would mean that the authorities will have to contend with another surplus.

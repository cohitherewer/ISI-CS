 New Delhi, Oct. 19: Chief Justice of India-designate Y.K. Sabarwal today said he personally favoured abolition of the death penalty.

 Justice Sabarwal, who will take over as chief justice on November 1, said that as a Supreme Court judge, he favoured the death penalty in the rarest of rare cases, but personally, he wanted capital punishment to be erased.

 I am of the view that as per the provision of law, death penalty should be awarded in the rarest of rare cases. But, if you ask my opinion as a citizen of the country, I am for abolition of death penalty, he said.

 Justice Sabharwal was the chief justice of Bombay High Court and a judge of Delhi High Court before his elevation to the Supreme Court.

 He will hold the office of chief justice till January 14, 2007. 

 Among the prominent judgments of Sabarwal include the one which termed the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly unconstitutional. He also ordered a CBI probe into the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MPs bribery case and had heard the case of discretionary allotment of petrol pumps.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ride to home in fatal end

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 18: Roads ravaged by tram tracks claimed a victim late last night, when a cement-laden truck lost control after hitting a crater on Judges? Court Road and ploughed into a middle-aged milkman on a cycle.

 Police said Nanda Ray, 42, who was pedalling home (opposite Alipore Central jail) close to midnight, was crushed under the wheels of the truck hurtling towards him from the opposite direction on pothole-paved Judges? Court Road with jagged tram tracks.

 This stretch is just one of the many that lie unattended to as the authorities bicker over rights and revenues and commuters continue to suffer.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has refused to touch roads fallen foul of tram lines, Calcutta Tramways Company pleads lack of funds, power players in Writers? Buildings are playing pass-the-buck and the high court is trying to fix responsibility. 

 Back to the accident site. The truck was impounded and its cleaner arrested, but the driver managed to flee. A recovery van was called in to extricate a profusely-bleeding Ray from under the wheels of the truck, whose axle had broken on hitting the pothole.

 An unconscious Ray was rushed to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared dead. The body of the victim, who hailed from Patna, was handed over to his younger brother.

 Minutes after the mishap, hundreds of local residents, including Trinamul Congress workers, staged a sit-in, protesting the condition of roads and tram tracks. They demonstrated till 3 am today, demanding the presence of officials from the CTC.

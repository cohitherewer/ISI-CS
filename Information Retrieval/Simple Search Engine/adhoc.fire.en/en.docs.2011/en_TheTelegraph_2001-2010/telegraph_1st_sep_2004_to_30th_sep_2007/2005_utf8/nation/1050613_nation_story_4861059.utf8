 Meeting ruckus puts CISF in spot

 new delhi: 

 The competence of the Central Industrial Reserve Force (CISF) 

 is under the scanner after it allowed protesters to run 

 riot at Vigyan Bhavan during a high-level meeting on education.

 The home ministry is trying to get video footage of the June 7 incident to analyse the CISFs role at the time when Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad activists stormed the high-security building and ransacked it.

 The activists were on the rampage for almost 15 minutes in their (CISF personnels) presence, an official said. 

 The force was being considered for the job of VVIP security, taking over from other paramilitary forces ? from even the Special Protection Group in some cases. The incident has put a question mark on the CISFs competence.

 This is the first time that the building ? adjacent to the official residences of Vice-President B.S. Shekhawat and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi ? has been ransacked. 

 About 50-odd Parishad activists had managed to enter Vigyan Bhavan and tried to disrupt the meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education, which was discussing the new national curriculum framework under the chairmanship of human resource development minister Arjun Singh. 

 Lie detector for fidelity test 

 Ahmedabad 

 (PTI): It is not just police who take help of the polygraph 

 test to get the truth out of alleged criminals, those facing 

 marital discord also turn to the lie-detector for solutions.

 The state directorate of forensic sciences that conducts polygraph and other complex tests has also done the test to resolve domestic tension when the fidelity of a spouse is in doubt, an official said.

 The polygraph test monitors the persons heartbeat, breathing rate and galvanic skin response and records this in correspondence to questions that the person undergoing the test has to answer.

 The test is conducted only after the court orders, if any, are in place, the official said. The family and the subject are counselled thoroughly. 

 In one case, a Gujarati NRI from Kenya suspected his wifes fidelity and came to Gujarat just to make her undergo the test. In another case, a man wanted to ascertain the parentage of his grandson and wanted his daughter-in-law to undergo the test to prevent a divorce. 

 Summons to doctors

 Daughters killed

 kanpur (PTI): 

 A woman who jumped into a well with her four daughters in 

 Bhilwara district survived but the children died. The girls

 be the reason behind Manglas suicide attempt, police 

 said.

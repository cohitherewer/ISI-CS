 Bill to rid judiciary of graft

 New Delhi, Aug. 24 (PTI): The government has plans to bring a bill, possibly in Parliaments winter session, to make the judiciary accountable and corruption-free, law minister H.R. Bhardwaj told the Lok Sabha today.

 Winding up discussions on the High Court and Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Amendment Bill, 2005, he said if every institution, including Parliament was accountable, then why not the judiciary.

 The bill seeks to remove certain anomalies to help judges get pension.

 The minister referred to the controversy in the wake of the apex courts verdict against reservation in unaided private educational institutions. He said the House has shown its resolve to keep its independence. 

 We are against any intrusion by the judiciary into the domain of legislature, Bhardwaj asserted but added that we should not precipitate matters.

 To assuage the feelings of the judiciary, he said this country has always treated (the) judiciary as a temple and preserved its sanctity.

 Bhardwaj praised the hard work being put in by apex court judges saying they have to deal with a lot of cases unlike many other countries and we cannot overlook this fact.

 He said the Centre favours raising the retirement age of high court judges from 62 to 65 in line with Supreme Court judges, but added that the matter needed a consensus.

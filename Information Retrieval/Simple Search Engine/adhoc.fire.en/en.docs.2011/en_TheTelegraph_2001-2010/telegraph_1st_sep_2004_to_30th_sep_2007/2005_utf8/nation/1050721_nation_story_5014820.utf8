 Bride one, husband one too many

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, July 20: Nineteen-year-old Shireen is not sure who her husband is. He might, after all, turn out to be her brother-in-law.

 Married twice in a space of 15 minutes ? first with the younger brother of the groom and then with the groom himself because of a mistake by a maulanas clerks ? the young bride has gone back to her parents.

 She is now waiting for the verdict of the Darul Uloom, the Deoband seminary to which her father has appealed.

 Shireen was to marry Siraj Ahmed last Friday in Obeiydih, a village in Pratapgarh in central Uttar Pradesh. But when Maulana Rahim Siddique took his seat at 12.30 pm, the 22-year-old groom had not yet reached. The maulanas clerks thought the groom was Sirajs brother Meraj, who had arrived by then.

 Instead of writing Sirajs name, they registered the name of his brother, reportedly at the behest of his relatives.

 Shireen, who had never met the brothers earlier, thought the 20-year-old waiting to ask for her hand was Siraj. So when the maulana asked if she would marry the man standing before her, Shireen repeated what she had been taught to say. Saadi qubool hai (I agree to be his wife) , she replied.

 It was only when Siraj reached after 15 minutes that the maulana realised the mistake. Under pressure from the villagers, he drew up another nikaahnama and filled in the name of the groom correctly.

 But some of those present insisted that Shireen accept Meraj as her husband, while senior clerics in the district protested at the way the marriages had been conducted.

 The two brothers later returned to Mahrorah, their village. Shireen was sent back to her parents house.

 In Obeiydih village, Shireens father Abbas Quazmi was asked by the local panchayat to accept Meraj as his son-in-law. But Sayed, the father of the two brothers, did not agree. Siraj, too, was adamant that Shireen was his wife.

 Aware of the recent Imrana case ? in which the local panchayat asked the 25-year-old mother of five, who was allegedly raped by her father-in-law, to see her husband as her son ? Shireens father decided to appeal to the Deoband seminary. 

 We have sent a petition to Darul Uloom and we will go by its fatwa, he said.

 The controversy has sparked opposing views. Some scholars said Shireen should accept Meraj as her husband, while others said the maulana could cancel the first nikaahnama.

 The Shariat has all kinds of possibilities and justice can be done for all human errors, said Kalbe Sadiq, the vice-president of the All India Muslim Personal law Board. If the petition goes to Darul Uloom, that would be the right step. I only hope the mistakes made during the Imrana case are not repeated.

 CM shackle for Nitish 

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: The BJP move to project Nitish Kumar as the chief ministerial candidate has generated much debate, not just among allies but also within the party. 

 BJP president L.K. Advani announced in Ranchi yesterday that Kumar is the National Democratic Alliance?s candidate for the top job in Bihar. 

 The move primarily aims at pre-empting Kumar from crossing over to the United Progressive Alliance after the elections. The BJP, through this move, has also targeted non-Yadav backward castes and projected the image of a united NDA.

 Senior BJP leaders like Shatrughan Sinha and Bihar party president Gopal Narain Singh and Janata Dal (United) president George Fernandes have expressed their discontent over the decision.

 The Fernandes camp is miffed as the last NDA meet to chalk out a campaign strategy had unanimously decided not to project anyone as chief minister and keep the campaign low-key so that the minorities are not driven back into the RJD fold. 

 The strategy was to avoid a frontal attack on the RJD, which had proved counter-productive in 2000 and 2004. ?There is a lurking suspicion that Kumar may cross over to the Lok Janashakti Party-Congress combine in the case of the three parties together managing a simple majority,? said an NDA leader.

 The Kurmi community to which Kumar belongs is dominant only in the Lok Sabha seats of Nalanda, Barh and Patna and has pockets of influence in old Bhojpur, Buxar and Arah, constituting 3 to 4 per cent of the electorate. The other prominent backward caste, Koeri, accounts for 6 per cent but its leaders are in several parties.

 Sources said the BJP was alarmed after Congress spokesperson Abhijit Singhvi suggested last week that the party could sign a post-poll pact with the Dal (U). Kumar had explored the option of a poll tie-up with the Congress while he was holding talks with the BJP on seat sharing. Smelling trouble, a jittery BJP concluded a pact with the Dal (U), conceding 138 seats to it and retaining only 105 for itself. 

 A section in the NDA suspects that in case of a hung House, the Congress could plan to form a coalition with support from Kumar and Paswan. Kumar could be rewarded with a plum cabinet berth in Delhi if Paswan or a Congress nominee becomes chief minister. 

 BJP sources, however, denied that fear of the Congress had made them announce Kumar?s candidature. ?The Dal (U) is the senior partner and Kumar is the natural leader of NDA in Bihar,? said a leader.

 ?Then why was he not projected during the first phase of poll?? countered a Dal (U) leader.

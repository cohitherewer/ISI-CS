 Pataudi co-accused surrender

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, June 21: Three of Mansur Ali Khan Pataudis co-accused in the black buck poaching case surrendered in Jhajjar today, a day after the former cricket captain was granted bail. 

 Shashi Singh, a friend and neighbour of Pataudi whose bail plea was last week rejected by Punjab and Haryana High Court, surrendered before police. Mohammad Ayub, a former Haryana block development and panchayat officer, and Balwan Singh, a local villager, surrendered before the chief judicial magistrate. They were remanded in police custody for a day. 

 Three other accused ? Dayasuddin, Dayal Singh and Shaheed Ahmed ? are still on the run. One accused, Madan Singh, is out on bail.

 The eight were caught with carcasses of a black buck, an endangered animal, and two rabbits during a routine highway check at Jhajjar, in Haryana, on June 3. 

 We now have most of the accused in the poaching case. We have interrogated them vigorously. We have some leads now, a district police officer said.

 Jhajjar police will crosscheck the statements of the three accused with those of Pataudi. We will probe line by line what Pataudi has had to say in the matter. We cannot say what they have said so far as it could derail investigations. There could be discrepancies. We would also ask them who shot the black buck and the hares and would like to take them to the spot where the incident took place, a police officer said.

 Madan Singh had told police that Pataudi shot the black buck, a charge the former cricketer has denied.

 A Jhajjar police source said that with Pataudi being granted bail, their task had been made much easier. It is easier to crack the others. That was not the case with Pataudi, with so much media glare over his alleged involvement. We have had to handle him with extra caution. We have a free hand now with the others, an officer said on condition of anonymity.

 Animal rights activist Naresh Kadyan of People for Animals said he, along with the All India Bishnoi Mahasabha and the Wildlife Trust of India, would oppose bail for the three who surrendered today.

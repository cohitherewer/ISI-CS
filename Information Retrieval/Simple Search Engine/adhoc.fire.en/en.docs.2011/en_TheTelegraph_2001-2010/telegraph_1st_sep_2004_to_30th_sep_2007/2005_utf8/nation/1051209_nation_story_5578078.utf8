 Cooking gas subsidy curb on govt table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Centre has sought the opinion of states on whether subsidy on cooking gas should be restricted to households below the poverty line.

 The ministry has recently written to the state governments seeking views on restricting the subsidy on domestic LPG only to families living below the poverty line, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said in Parliament today.

 The minister clarified that part of the subsidy was borne by the government and the rest by oil companies. The oil firms are losing around Rs 100 a cylinder on LPG sold for domestic use.

 The suggestion to restrict the supply of subsidised domestic cooking gas only to the poor was first mooted at a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee of the petroleum ministry.

 Expressing concern over LPG meant for domestic cooking being diverted to commercial use, Aiyar said the colour of cylinders for use by commercial establishments was being changed.

 He said diversion of kerosene for adulteration of diesel was because of the difference in the administered price and market price of kerosene and asked the House to reflect on how to narrow the divide.

 If states extend cooperation, the minister added, adulteration could be tackled more effectively. 

 A meeting of state secretaries will be held in a day or two to discuss how to effectively control the menace, he said.

 A committee has been set up under C. Rangarajan to look in to the issue in detail. The committee has been constituted in October and it has been asked to give its report in six months, he said.

 Twin games in air

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 6: France and the US will deploy F-16 and Mirage 2000-V aircraft that are competing for a multi-billion-dollar Indian Air Force order for bilateral exercises this month and in November, air headquarters sources said.

 The F-16 and the Mirage 2000-V versions that will exercise with IAF Sukhois and other fighter aircraft are two of the four types for which India had sent request for proposals. The other two are the double-engine MiG-29M/M2 from Russias RSK MiG Corporation and the JAS 39C Gripen from Swedens SAAB.

 The F-16 Block D produced by Lockheed Martin will exercise with the IAF in one of a series of drills called Cope India that will be based at Kalaikunda in Bengal. Last month, Indian and US defence officials surveyed the Kalaikunda base and also Calcutta airport, which will function as a secondary base for the exercise.

 The India-France exercise, Garuda II, will be held at the Istres airbase in France from June 15 to June 30. 

 The IAF will deploy six Sukhoi 30 fighter jets that will fly from their base at Bareilly and an IL-78 refueller aircraft. An IAF contingent of 120 will be flagged off from Bareilly on Thursday. The contingent will fly to Jamnagar in Gujarat and then to Istres via Jyankils in Egypt. The French air force will deploy, apart from the Mirage 2000-V (produced by Dassault Aviation), a C-135 tanker.

 The exercise will provide both sides an excellent opportunity to learn from each others employment philosophies, assistant chief of staff (operations) at air the headquarters Air Vice-Marshal Sumit Mukherjee said today.

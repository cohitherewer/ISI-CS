 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Smoke rings might yet waft across Bollywood screens.

 Producer-director Mahesh Bhatt today moved Delhi High Court against the governments decision to ban smoking on screen from October 2.

 Once the ban kicks in, Bhatt ? who has slammed the governments notification as censorship of thought ? will not be able to show what he wants to in his latest production: a film on prostitution where the lead actor holds a cigarette in her hands. Though the movie is based in Zurich, the notification, if implemented, would ensure huge cuts by the censor board in India.

 According to the regulations, no Bollywood film released after October 2 can show smoking on screen. Television channels will also have to abide by the October 2 date. 

 Exceptions can be made only in the case of historical characters or for period films or if a film wants to emphasise the point that smoking is bad for health.

 Bhatt, who has directed movies like Arth and Saraansh, filed a petition through advocate Pankaj Monga. 

 The veteran film-maker sought quashing of the ban under the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade, Commerce, Sale and Distribution) Act, 2003. His petition termed the ban a violation of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution.

 Monga told the division bench of Justices Mukul Mudgal and H.R. Malhotra that the notification was beyond the rule-making power of the government as the act only dealt with the prohibition of advertisement and regulation of trade, commerce, sale and distribution. He also contended that the notification was in conflict with the Cinematography Act of 1952.

 The court posted the matter for hearing tomorrow after additional solicitor-general P.P. Malhotra, who appeared for the Centre, requested a day to prepare for the legal battle. The bench also said a stay could be issued if more time to prepare was needed.

 Indian Medical Association president Dr K.K. Aggarwal defended the ban. Everywhere there is surrogate advertising. In every scene that shows cigarettes, there are sponsorships from tobacco companies ? this is a well-known fact. This is how people are initiated into smoking. In a survey conducted by us, 80 per cent of schoolchildren have said they were inspired to smoke by celebrities. The beedi culture was started by Amitabh Bachchan and Rajnikant, Aggarwal said.

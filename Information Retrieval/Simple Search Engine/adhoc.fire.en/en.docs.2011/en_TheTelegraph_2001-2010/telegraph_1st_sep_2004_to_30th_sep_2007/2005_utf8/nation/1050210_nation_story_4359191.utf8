 More killings

 Srinagar, Feb. 9: A senior National Conference leader, who was tipped for the post of mayor, was shot dead at Jawahar Nagar late this evening, reports our correspondent. 

 Police said unidentified militants pumped three bullets into Mohammad Maqbool Shah, who was elected to the Srinagar Municipal Corporation from the ward. No group has yet claimed responsibility. 

 ?He suffered a serious head injury. Militants fired at him from close range as he was leaving the mosque late this evening after prayers,? a senior police officer said. 

 ?We took him to SMHS Hospital immediately as he was bleeding profusely. Doctors referred him to Soura Medical Institute. However, he succumbed,? said Javed Ahmad, a relative. Shah was serving as the imam of the local mosque, he added. 

 The National Conference, according to sources, had decided to select him as mayor of the Srinagar municipality.

 District police chief Syed Ahmed Syed visited Jawahar Nagar and launched a hunt for the killers.

 The killing took place a day after a ruling People?s Democratic Party corporator was gunned down at Beerwa in central Budgam district. Ghulam Mohi-ud-Din Mir, who was elected unopposed to the Beerwa municipal committee, was recently abducted and killed by militants. He was also tipped to head the local civic body.

 The police had said it was difficult to provide security to every candidate who participated in the recent civic polls. Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had also ruled out individual security. The police are working out a security plan for the scores of candidates who contested the polls, sources said.

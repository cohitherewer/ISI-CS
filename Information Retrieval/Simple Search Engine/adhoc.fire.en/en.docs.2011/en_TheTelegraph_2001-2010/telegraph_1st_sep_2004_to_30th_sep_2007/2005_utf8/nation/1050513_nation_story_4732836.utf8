 PM rings alert on Pak talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said he would not be able to take Indian public opinion with him in persisting with the peace talks if terrorist attacks continued from across the border.

 Singh welcomed Pakistan President Pervez Musharrafs pledge not to allow terrorism to impede the process but made it clear that much will depend on the ground situation after the snow melts on the mountain passes in Kashmir.

 Winding up a special discussion on foreign affairs in the Lok Sabha this evening, Singh touched on a host of issues. He asserted that India has never violated the Indus water treaty with Pakistan and said the government is preparing to provide all details the World Bank neutral expert might need to make a comprehensive assessment of the Baglihar hydroelectric project in Jammu and Kashmir.

 The 1960 treaty provides for World Bank intervention if the two sides are unable to solve their differences. We had felt that a reference to the World Bank (by Pakistan) was premature because further technical discussions between our experts could have led to a narrowing of differences, Singh said.

 He said he had told Musharraf if Islamabad could come up with a convincing and technically verifiable objection, India would be willing to consider appropriate design modifications.

 On Nepal, Singh said: Our only concern is that Nepal should approach the new era of modernisation with a strong commitment to the twin pillars of Nepals nationhood, namely constitutional monarchy and multiparty democracy.

 Singh said India is working closely with Brazil, Germany and Japan to mobilise more than two-thirds majority of the UN General Assembly in favour of a significant restructuring of the world body.

 We believe that India, with its large population, dynamic economy, long history of contribution to international peacekeeping and other regional and international causes, deserves to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council, he said.

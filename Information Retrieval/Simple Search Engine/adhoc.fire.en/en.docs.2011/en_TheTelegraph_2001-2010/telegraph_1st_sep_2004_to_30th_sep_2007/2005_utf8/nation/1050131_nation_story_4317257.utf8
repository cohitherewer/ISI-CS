 Much ado in Britain over a grain of salt

 AMIT ROY 

 Not Too much, Please

 London, Jan. 30: After cigarettes, it?s salt. It?s bad for you.

 The British people ? especially Indians who cook with it and then shake an additional generous amount over their curries ? are being urged drastically to reduce their salt intake or risk strokes and heart attacks.

 The department of health has urged South Asians, particularly, to overcome their cultural cravings and cut out the salt. And on Wednesday, on what was theoretically Salt Awareness Day (though almost no one was aware of it), a pressure group called Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH) aimed its campaign at older people. 

 It claims that those over 60 could slash their risk of a stroke by up to 31 per cent and a heart attack by 24 per cent within days by reducing their salt intake to the recommended 6 gm a day. 

 According to the Food Standards Agency, men consume an average of 11 gm of salt a day and women 8.1 gm. At this rate, linguists worry that expressions such as ?salt of the earth? and ?namak haram? may take on new meanings. 

 Indian restaurant owners taking action include top chef Kuldeep Singh, whose establishments include Mela, Soho Spice, Chowki and The Three Monkeys in London and Dilli in Manchester. 

 ?Salt is a major problem, especially in this country,? he acknowledged. ?It is dangerous for health and we use less salt in our cooking because we cook for English people. But our Indian customers ask for extra salt on the table.? 

 Graham MacGregor, chairman of the salt action group and professor of cardiovascular medicine at St George?s Hospital, London, said: ?We are talking of preventing 70,000 strokes and heart attacks if the whole UK population could reduce their salt intake to recommended levels....? 

 But salt has its lobby, among those who sell the stuff. Peter Sherratt, general secretary of the Salt Manufacturers? Association, attacked the advice to older people. 

 ?CASH has never acknowledged the fact that there are many experts who totally disagree with it on the suggested link between salt and blood pressure,? he said.

 The salt action group hit back: ?The Salt Manufacturer?s Association and parts of the food industry have conducted a public relations campaign over the last decade to persuade other food manufacturers, government, nutritionists and other health professionals, as well as the general population, that the evidence about salt is not clear and that no action is justified. This view is contrary to the current medical and scientific consensus.

 ?We aim to counter these claims with the wealth of scientific evidence, which clearly links high salt intake to ill health.?

 Poll takes ?toll? on crime

 - Cops on success path

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, March 6: In the season of political shenanigans, crime has taken the backseat.

 ?All the goondas of political parties are busy helping their bosses muster support for the kursi,? observed a senior doctor and office-bearer of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Patna.

 Senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan agreed that the law and order situation has improved but differs on the reason. ?The sharp decline in crime is the result of police action. The abduction of Kislay was the last major crime in Patna,? he said.

 Most abduction cases in the state have been solved and several criminals either killed in encounters or arrested, Khan claimed. The SSP made this observation a day after some ?local goons? broke into the office of city SP Shalin.

 Khan, however, admitted that reports of minor crimes continued to trickle in, especially from the districts.

 In a major breakthrough, a joint team of Madhepura and Purnea police recently arrested Sitaram Yadav, a doctor, in connection with the abduction of U.K. Raja. 

 The Purnea-based doctor was abducted on January 1 and rescued after a fortnight. The abduction had led to protests by the medical community, which paralysed the healthcare system.

 Police sources said Yadav acted as a middleman for the Pintu Yadav gang, which was responsible for the abduction. ?Yadav, who is said to be a close associate of a leading RJD politician of the area, played the mediator?s role and even delivered the ransom money of Rs 15 lakh,? a source said.

 With the help of the special task force and the intelligence bureau, the police team earlier arrested one Vivekanand Yadav in the case. On his statement, they nabbed Bipin Yadav, the nephew of Sitaram. The police finally laid their hands on Sitaram when he approached them for Bipin?s release.

 The state police plan to make more arrests in the near future. ?We are hoping to nab more gangsters and associates of the abductors. At least three gangs are involved in the case and we are in the hunt for over 30 people,? the source added. 

 IMA state president Vijay Shankar Singh said the high court has played the most significant role in improving the law and order situation. ?The high court?s timely interventions led to the arrest of so many notorious criminals and politicians, paving the way for a peaceful and fair election,? Singh said.

 IMA counsel Mahendra Prasad Gupta too heaped praises on the court. ?Thanks to the court, we had not only a free and fair but also a fearless election. It shows that if there is a will there is also a way. Bihar can improve,? he observed.

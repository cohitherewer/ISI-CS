 Killer cops get life, 17 years on

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Jan. 18: In a judgment hailed by human rights activists, 11 policemen have been awarded life sentence in a custody death case. 

 The Bombay High Court division bench in Nagpur sentenced the policemen, including a retired deputy superintendent, for the custodial death that took place in Wardha district.

 But it took more than 17 years for the judgment to be pronounced. On November 5, 1987, Dilip Ghosale was arrested for a robbery at Arvi in Wardha district, near Nagpur, on October 24. 

 Ghosale, a member of the Pardhi tribe that is considered ?criminal?, was immediately interrogated at the police station. 

 The prosecution charged that the police used ?third-degree methods? on him on November 5 and 6, leading to his death in custody. 

 The bench of Justices J. Patel and S.T. Kharche also convicted the policemen of destroying evidence related to Ghosale?s death. 

 The prosecution charged that the police systematically destroyed the evidence. It said that first Ghosale?s body was dumped on the outskirts of Nagpur in Katol. Then, the police felt that it was not far enough and picked up the body and dumped it in Adilabad in Andhra Pradesh in a police jeep. The body was left under a bridge. 

 After the death, the case was heard at the district sessions court in Wardha. But judge D.S. Meghe acquitted all the accused on April 30, 1996, saying the eyewitness accounts could not be believed because they were from criminals kept in the same lock-up as Ghosale. 

 Following the sessions court judgment, the accused were reinstated in their jobs. Deputy superintendent of police Jagdish Bhalerao is now retired and police inspector Arun Bhadikar is posted in Aurangabad. Most of the other policemen are now posted in the Vidharbha region. 

 The prosecution had moved the high court after the sessions court judgment. The high court overturned the sessions court order yesterday and imposed a punishment on the convicted. They also have to pay a fine of Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000 per head, the total amounting to Rs 2 lakh. They have been asked to surrender before the trial court by month-end. 

 The high court bench has asked that the money raised as fine to be given to Ghosale?s widow. But finding her may be difficult after so many years because it is felt that she has moved on with her tribe. Not much is known about the other members of his family either. 

 But human rights activist Mihir Desai hailed the judgment as ?rare?. ?In case the crime was actually committed, this is a suitable sentence,? said the Mumbai-based activist, who was an associate of Teesta Setalvad in the Best Bakery case. 

 He also welcomed the judgment as ?Maharashtra has the largest number of cases of custody deaths?.

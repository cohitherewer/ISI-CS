 Monsoon noose around tigers

 New Delhi, May 18: Tiger conservationists want Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is visiting Ranthambore National Park next week, to deploy armed policemen in all sanctuaries before the monsoon, the peak poaching season.

 It is the most vulnerable time for the tigers as poachers have always used this moment to strike. This is when protection is difficult in forests as the rain washes away the roads and accessibility is a problem, says leading conservationist Valmik Thapar.

 Belinda Wright, executive director of Wildlife Protection Society of India, agrees with him and points out that the deployment of 120 Rajasthan Armed Constabulary personnel at Ranthambore for an ongoing tiger census has been a success. The park has been closed to the public for the duration of the census.

 This deployment is a success because people are not coming in illegally as they used to earlier, says Wright, also a member of the Rajasthan governments empowered committee looking into Ranthambore, Sariska and Bharatpur, who will accompany Singh on his May 23 visit. 

 A nil tiger count reported from Sariska in March set alarm bells ringing, forcing the Centre to order a CBI probe into reports of poaching at the park. In April, the Manmohan Singh government set up a task force of experts to look into conservation of the national animal.

 It is important that the Prime Minister cares for the tiger reserves and his visit will help to bring focus to the problems at these reserves, Wright said.

 Both Thapar and Wright have called for better policing of the tiger reserves, calling it a vital short-term measure. Nearly 15 vulnerable areas have been identified and home guards and armed police need to be deployed immediately at their periphery, the tiger man said. Chief ministers must be requested by the Prime Minister to do this on a war footing, he added. 

 The conservationists also agree that a wildlife crime prevention bureau is needed immediately. Thapar said it must start functioning before the monsoon.

 Wright seeks more transparency in the management of the parks and is opposed to the proposed tribal rights bill, being pushed by the Left, that will give tribals right over forest land. 

 Thapar, who is on the tiger task force, says it should make some interim recommendations before the monsoon breaks so that urgent relief can be provided to the big cats. He also wants the CBI to be given a national mandate to investigate poaching and illegal trade.

 The Union environment ministry has conveyed to the Supreme Court its reluctance to extend the CBI probe to all other tiger reserves. The court had issued a notice to the ministry after the director of the Wildlife Trust of India, Ashok Kumar, filed an application. 

 But the ministry suggested to the court it could issue a directive to the CBI to probe wildlife crimes as and when requested by either the Centre or the states. The bureau is usually asked for its consent before a case is handed to it. 

 The ministry also observed that there was a general reluctance among the states, under whose territorial jurisdiction the sanctuaries and national parks fall, to refer wildlife cases to the CBI. 

 The states largely refrain from issuing authorisation for a CBI probe, which is a limiting factor in containing wildlife crime at the national level, it said.

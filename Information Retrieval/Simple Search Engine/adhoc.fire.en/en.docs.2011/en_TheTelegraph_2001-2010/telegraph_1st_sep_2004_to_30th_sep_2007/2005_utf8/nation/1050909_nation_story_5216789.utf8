 Crore and more illiterate in Bengal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 8: Over a crore people in Bengal are still illiterate, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said here today. 

 This is a shame. Out of about eight crore people in the state, more than one crore still do not know how to read and write, the chief minister said. 

 He was speaking at a ceremony to observe international literacy day organised by the state mass education extension department.

 Bhattacharjee promised measures to eradicate illiteracy, but said there were eight districts where the rate was abnormally high. They are Bankura, Birbhum, Purulia, North and South Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Malda and Murshidabad.

 The chief minister said acute poverty was one of the main reasons for low literacy rates in some rural areas. Children are forced to quit their studies as they need to earn for their families.

 This should not be the trend in a state like ours which has produced great men like Rabindranath Tagore and Vidyasagar. We are doing our best not only to increase the literacy rate, but we also want to ensure that we can sustain the literacy movement.

 The government plans to start a string of schemes, for which it is negotiating with various funding agencies.

 We have to ensure that neo-literates can continue their education. Experience has revealed that the literacy movement becomes meaningless if we cannot ensure continuing education for them.

 Bhattacharjee, who is on an industrialisation drive, said: Development of vocational education will produce efficient entrepreneurs. Self-employment is extremely important now as it is not possible for the government to provide employment to all educated youths.

 Later, Kanti Biswas, state school education minister, said one lakh children below the age of five were still out of school. The target is to cut the number to zero in a couple of years.

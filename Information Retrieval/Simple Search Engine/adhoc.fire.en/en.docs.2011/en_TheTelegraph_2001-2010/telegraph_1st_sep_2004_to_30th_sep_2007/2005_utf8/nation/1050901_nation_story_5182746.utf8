 Azhar gets guards after threat calls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Azharuddin: Don cloud

 Hyderabad, Aug. 31: Four armed guards have been posted outside former India cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddins Banjara Hills home following death threats from the Mumbai underworld.

 Police today confirmed the threats. I received a call from the Mumbai police commissioner that Azharuddins life was threatened by underworld goons who operated from across the border, Andhra Pradesh police chief Swaranjit Sen said.

 Sen said he has told Hyderabad police commissioner Dinesh Reddy to make adequate arrangements for the protection of Azharuddin and his family.

 Our inquiries show that the threat is serious, said additional police commissioner Tejdeep Kaur Menon. The callers had threatened to blow up Azharuddins house and the gym he runs, Menon added.

 Police sources said the threat is from Dawood Ibrahims gang. The fugitive don is wanted in connection with the serial blasts that killed more than 200 people in Mumbai in 1993.

 The police chief made it clear that there was no request for security from Azharuddin. Asked if the police viewed the threat seriously, Sen said: Any public figure getting a threat from mafia groups is a matter of serious concern.

 Azharuddin, banned for life from cricket for match-fixing, was among five Indian players to be punished in the scandal that rocked the game worldwide five years ago.

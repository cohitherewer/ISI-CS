 Police job gift to troubled states

 ALOKE TIKKU 

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Home minister Shivraj Patil has set out to create jobs for youths in troubled states after exhorting them to choose the central police forces for a career rather than militants outfits. 

 Patil has ordered an overhaul of the recruitment policy in central police forces to tilt it in favour of youths in the embattled states, from Assam in the east to Jammu and Kashmir in the north. It is estimated that the government might raise nearly 100 battalions over the next few years, including 20 battalions each for the Sashastra Seema Bal, the Border Security Force and the Central Reserve Police Force. 

 The home ministry has finalised the broad policy that requires the central police forces to make 40 per cent of recruitment from the troubled states (most of which are on the borders), up from 20 per cent. Sources said a circular had been sent to the forces but it would take time for the nitty-gritty to be finalised. 

 ?This is the first time that the ministry is taking a comprehensive re-look at the recruitment policy,? a home ministry official said. According to the revised policy, 60 per cent of the requirement would be on an all-India basis. The forces would reserve 20 per cent seats for candidates from border areas where they are deployed and another 20 per cent for states wracked by militancy or Naxalite trouble. 

 The idea is to create more opportunities to wean the youths away from militancy. Moreover, recruits from these areas are likely to be more sensitive to people?s rights.

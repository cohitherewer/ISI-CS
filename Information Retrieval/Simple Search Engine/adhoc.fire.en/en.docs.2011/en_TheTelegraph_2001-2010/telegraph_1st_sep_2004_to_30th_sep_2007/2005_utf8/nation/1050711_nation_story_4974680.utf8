 Dowry respite

 New Delhi, July 10 (PTI): A court here has granted anticipatory bail to a former army officer and five of his family members after it found that a dowry case lodged by his daughter-in-law was seemingly motivated.

 Preeti, an airhostess, had filed a case of harassment and criminal breach of trust against her husband Major K.S. Gill, father-in-law Col (retd) Jeet Singh Gill, mother-in-law Surinder and two of her sisters-in-law and their husbands.

 Granting the anticipatory bail, additional sessions judge Narottam Kaushal said: The allegations against the parents-in-law seem to be motivated and eventful. Preeti had never lived with her in-laws who stay in Pune, he said. She works in Delhi and has not lived with her husband on a regular basis as well.

 Describing the airhostess as an educated woman who seems to be well aware of her rights, the court said: The married sisters and their husbands could have no occasion to harass the complainant who never lived with them...

 Preetis husband, now posted in Mhow in Madhya Pradesh, had not applied for anticipatory bail.

 The Gills alleged in their bail plea that Preeti had sent a series of intimidating e-mails to her father-in-law. 

 Their counsel said Preeti in her e-mails had demanded Rs 30 lakh and threatened to file a false complaint against the family, saying, in the Indian system, everybody listens to the woman and she could put them behind bars whenever she wanted to.

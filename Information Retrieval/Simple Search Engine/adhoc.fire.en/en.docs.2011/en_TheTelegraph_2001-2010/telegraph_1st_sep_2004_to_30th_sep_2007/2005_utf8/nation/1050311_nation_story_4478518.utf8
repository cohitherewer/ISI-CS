 Gandhians cold to Cong ?Dandi? march

 Ahmedabad, March 10 (PTI): 

 Veteran Gandhians have decided to abstain from the 

 re-enactment of the Dandi march to mark the 75th anniversary 

 of Mahatma Gandhi?s salt satyagraha by only conveying their 

 ?good wishes? even as the Congress is busy making preparations 

 for the event.

 The Congress, however, maintains there is nothing political about the event, beginning March 12, and that it is aimed at making people, especially youths, aware of Gandhi?s contributions.

 ?The whole thing is being organised by the Congress whereas ideally they should have asked us to organise it and lend their support.... They have not even sent proper invitations to Gandhians,? said veteran Gandhian. Chunibhai Vaidya. ?...However, I wish them all the success,? he added.

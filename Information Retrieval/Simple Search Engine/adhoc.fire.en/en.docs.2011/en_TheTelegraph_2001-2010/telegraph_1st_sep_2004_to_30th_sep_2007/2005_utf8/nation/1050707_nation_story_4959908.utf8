 PM keeps off blame game 

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 London, July 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that he would not like to blame Pakistan for the terrorist incident at Ayodhya till all the evidence is examined. 

 He nonetheless described the terrorist attack as a major incident which if repeated could affect the India-Pakistan peace process. It only benefits those elements who do not want the peace process between India and Pakistan to move forward, he said.

 Singh reiterated that India and Pakistan were committed to making the peace process irreversible and hoped that the two sides would stick to this solemn commitment. 

 About progress in India-Pakistan talks, he said, I am not saying that everything is rosy in the Garden of Eden, but insisted that there was a movement forward. 

 He singled out the increase in people-to-people contact, the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service, the agreement on the Iran-Pakistan-India joint pipeline project and the fruitful talks on the Sir Creek and Siachen disputes as evidence of the desire of the two countries to lend momentum to the peace process.

 Singh, however, emphasised that Indian public opinion had to be taken along to make a success of the peace process. He cautioned against the repetition of terrorist incidents.

 The Prime Minister also went on the front foot to dismiss the communal argument that the Ayodhya attack had hurt (only) Hindu feelings. Taking a broader view, he, instead, argued that the incident was an insult to all humanity and that whenever a place of worship is damaged or attacked, something in all of us dies. As human beings we should all be concerned.

 He chided the BJP for scoring cheap political points over the incident and asking for the resignation of the Union home minister. By this logic, L.K. Advani should have resigned many times over. He was the presiding deity when the J amp;K Legislative Assembly was attacked, when the Chattisinghpora incident took place, when terrorists attacked Parliament and the Akshardham temple.

 It was Jaswant Singh (the then external affairs minister) who escorted a terrorist like Masood Azhar (founder of Jaish-e-Mohammad) to the safety of Kandahar, he said. 

 What was significant was that Singh repeatedly resisted the temptation to blame Pakistan. In response to a question about the so-called Islamic terrorists praying at a temple before attacking the disputed site, the Prime Minister said blandly: We have to evaluate the evidence to come to a conclusion (about who the terrorists were). 

 However, he said: There is no doubt that the infrastructure of terrorism (in Pakistan-controlled territories) is by and large intact.

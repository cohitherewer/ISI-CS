 Deport drive pushed back

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 9: The Orissa government today postponed the deportation of 1,548 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants from Mahakalpada block of Kendrapara district after a directive from the Centre.

 ?The deportation is off till further orders from the Centre. The Centre, in a letter to us, has raised certain queries about the deportation list, quot; Orissa home secretary Santosh Kumar told The Telegraph. Kumar is supervising the process. 

 The decision led to relief and jubilation among several villagers in the Mahakalpada block. Hundreds of residents in Ramnagar, Baulokani, Jamboo and Kharinasi gram panchayats, came out to the streets and burst fire crackers. The Ramnagar grampanchayat sarpanch Mrutunjaya Mandal said community feasts are being organised in various places.

 Earlier, the Kendrapara district administration had set February 23 as the deportation date forcing the settlers to wind up their business and bank accounts. 

 In January, the immigrants were asked to quit India in keeping with Section-3 (C) of Foreigners Act, 1946.

 The stalling of deportation follows chief minister Naveen Patnaik?s indication on Saturday that his government may review the ?Quit India? notices served to the ?Bangladeshi infiltrators.? 

 Asked whether the state government would review the deportation move of Bangla infiltrators, the chief minister had said: ?It can be reviewed if the list has any errors.? The deportation list, which includes names of several dead men, over 800 children and several senior citizens, has widened the divide between the ruling Biju Janata Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party with the latter opposing it on the ground that all the people faced with the deportation orders are Hindus.

 The Opposition Congress and Communist parties have also come out against the move, appealing to the governor to stop the deportation. A delegation of the Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee has met senior central leaders and sought the Centre?s intervention in this matter.

 BJP state president Juel Oram had taken umbrage to the home secretary?s remark saying that the officer had commented without consulting the chief minister.

 Several people on the deportation list had earlier petitioned President APJ Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi, asking them to step in avert the ?injustice? being done to them. Bhattacharya had sought a report from the CPM?s Orissa state unit on the notices served by the Naveen Patnaik government on the illegal settlers. 

 The settlers had formed a pressure group called the Utkal Bangiya Surakshya Samiti comprising local Oriya residents and Bengali immigrants.

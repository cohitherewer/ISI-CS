 Leg One raises questions for Laloo

 Patna, Feb. 3: The early signs may not be too pleasant for Laloo Prasad Yadav but there is time for the Bihar strongman to emerge on top, yet again.

 Pre-poll surveys and now exit poll results, which indicate that the National Democratic Alliance is catching up with the Rashtriya Janata Dal, could present a more positive picture for Laloo Prasad in the next two phases if his traditional support base rally round him.

 Even if the RJD is able to bag 90-odd seats in the 243-member House, it could still have its chief minister with the help of Congress and Independent legislators. 

 Though Muslims voted for non-RJD ?secular? candidates in some constituencies today, analysts said they are likely to rally around Laloo Prasad in the remaining phases as they would not want the ?communal? BJP to come to power. 

 While it remains to be seen if media projections and pollsters are correct in their analysis, Laloo Prasad will leave no stone unturned from tomorrow to exploit the ?fear psychosis? of the minority community. 

 On the other hand, upper caste voters, who had hitherto thought of backing the Congress or the Lok Janshakti Party, could eventually lend support to the NDA, triggering a ?reverse polarisation? in the state.

 This scenario may also spell danger for Laloo Prasad. With an eye on OBC votes, the BJP subtly conveyed to non-Yadav backward voters that Nitish Kumar could be the next chief minister.

 Analysts said Ram Vilas Paswan?s strategy of fielding Yadavs in Muslim-dominated RJD strongholds while fielding Muslims in Yadav-dominated areas seems to have made a dent in the RJD votebank. 

 While Paswan today said the ?M-Y? has been broken, Laloo Prasad pointed out that the so called ?M-D? (Muslim-Dalit) combination of Paswan stood for ?murderers and dacoits?.

 Knowing well that any sign of the BJP improving its tally would regroup Muslims behind Yadav, party leaders have tactically understated their case. 

 Both senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley and Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal (United) said they did not want to overstate the NDA?s performance in the polls.

 ?We consciously understated our case while Ram Vilas overstated his. This helped us,? said a beaming Jaitley after the first round of polls. 

 Of the 64 constituencies that went to polls today, in over a dozen places Muslims voted for either the LJP or the Congress, while in some places even Yadavs are believed to have ditched the RJD chief as he fielded candidates from other communities. 

 Eminent Yadav candidates fielded by parties like the Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party have also split RJD votes in certain places.

 However, in some places of the Gaya-Jehanabad belt, the poll boycott call of the CPI (Maoist) seems to have helped the RJD. 

 CPI ML (Liberation) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said his party?s presence has unsettled all other parties in Bihar, including the RJD.

 The NDA seems more focused than its rivals, especially after its constituents struck a balanced seat deal to avoid ?friendly fights?.

 The stakes are high for the RJD, which had bagged 33 of the 64 seats in the 2000 elections. The BJP held six, JD(U) 12, Congress one and others 12. 

 It, though, remains to be seen how the RJD chief sets his own house in order. 

 Even a staunch supporter like Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, according to reports, has been sulking for the past several days . He has not been seen campaigning for party candidates in the run-up to today?s polls, said a report.

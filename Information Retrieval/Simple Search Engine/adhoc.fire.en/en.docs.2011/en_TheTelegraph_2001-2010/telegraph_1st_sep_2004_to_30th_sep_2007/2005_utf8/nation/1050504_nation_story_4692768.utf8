 Laloo?s party slams poll panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 3: The Election Commission today came under fire in the Lok Sabha for its ?partisan? role during the recent Bihar elections.

 Rashtriya Janata Dal member Raghunath Jha went to the extent of alleging that commission officials prevented party supporters from exercising their franchise.

 Jha said the poll panel had displayed ?high-handedness? because of which his party lost a few seats by a narrow margin. Several members demanded that the constitutional body be governed by a model code of conduct and made answerable.

 RJD member from Bihar Devendra Prasad Yadav, who initiated the discussion, said ?a committee should be formed to look into adherence to various provisions by the EC itself?. Yadav particularly attacked the poll panel?s adviser, K.J. Rao. ?I want to be on record for this,? he said, accusing the official of excesses.

 The Bihar MP said voting should be made compulsory as the ?spirit of democracy is fading? with declining voting percentage and blamed the poll panel for the absence of names of valid voters.

 Yadav also accused the constitutional body of engaging in rhetoric through the media, especially when it came to Bihar.

 The allegations led to objections from Varkala Radhakrishnan, who was in the chair. ?This is not good, this is not correct. Your speech is directly against the EC. You can suggest any number of electoral reforms but cannot speak on conduct of the EC. They are doing their job as per the Constitution.?

 Yadav countered by saying that the commission was not above the Constitution. ?If the EC is partial, where will we go with our complaints??

 Ramjilal Suman, of the Samajwadi Party, said the poll commission was not more important than Parliament.

 Yadav said there was a need to look into the functioning of electronic voting machines, which, he said, were faulty on many occasions. He also said the number of voters per booth should not exceed 500 and added that at present, sometimes 1,500 people cast their ballot in a single booth.

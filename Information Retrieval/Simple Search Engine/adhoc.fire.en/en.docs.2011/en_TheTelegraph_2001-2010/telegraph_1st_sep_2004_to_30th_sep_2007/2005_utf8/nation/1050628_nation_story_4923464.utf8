 Europe hitches ride to moon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, June 27: The European Space Agency will ride piggyback on Indias unmanned mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-I, with the indigenous orbiter carrying three instruments of the ESA meant to mine data on the lunar surface during its 2007-08 odyssey.

 The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) signed a memorandum of understanding with the ESA for fitting these payloads onboard Chandrayaan-I. The 525-kg spacecraft will gather data on the moon, hovering at 100 km from its surface.

 A similar agreement will be finalised in a couple of months with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) after a decision is taken on the instruments to be fitted on the Indian orbiter, Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair said here.

 Nair said his organisation had picked international instruments to create opportunities for the cooperative study of data on the moon. 

 It chose the instruments of Rutherford Appleton Laboratory of the UK to measure elements distributed over the lunar surface and to monitor X-ray bursts from the sun, Max Planck Institute of Aeronomie, Germany, for detection of minerals on the moon and the Swedish Institute of Space Physics to study the impact of solar wind.

 The Isro chairman said the organisation has been engaged in discussions with Nasa over carrying the MiniSAR ? a miniature imaging radar instrument to map the polar landscape and deposits of the moon ? as proposed by Johns Hopkins Laboratory of the US. 

 MiniSAR is to detect water ice in cold traps on the lunar poles up to a depth of few metres, he said.

 Another US payload could be the Moon Mineralogy Mapper ? an imaging spectrometer, proposed jointly by the Jet Propulsion Lab and Brown University of the US ? to assess mineral resources and characterise the chemical composition of the lunar surface.

 The Isro chief said the organisation would launch two Russian satellites as part of its participation in the Glonass constellation of 24 navigational satellites. Eleven of these are already in orbit, while the remaining 13 will be launched soon.

 The Russian satellites will be launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, using the geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV), in 2006-08.

 We have agreed to cooperate with Russia in the Glonass project. In the project, there are two objectives. The first is to launch the Russian-built satellite using the GSLV and another satellite in the polar orbit. The second is to build an Indo-Russian spacecraft for research, Nair said.

 Earlier, the Isro chairman gave an overall view of the Indian space programme during inaugural addresses at the twin conferences ? Advances in Planetary Exploration and Bringing Space Benefits to the Asian region. 

 The conferences were organised by the Astronautical Society of India and the International Academy of Astronauts in association with the International Institute of Space Law and Isro and its commercial wing, Antrix Corporation.

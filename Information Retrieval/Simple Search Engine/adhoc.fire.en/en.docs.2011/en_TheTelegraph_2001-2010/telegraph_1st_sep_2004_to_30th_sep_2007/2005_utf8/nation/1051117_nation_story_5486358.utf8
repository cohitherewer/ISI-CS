 Cong stands up for govt on Iran vote

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Congress today indicated it would back the governments decision on the Iran vote and seemed to caution the Left against withdrawing support on the issue.

 This is a coalition government formed on the basis of a common minimum programme. Everybody shares a collective responsibility. If one or more constituents disagree with a government policy to the extent of wanting to pull out support to it, they will have to explain to people why they brought about this situation, a Congress general secretary said in what appeared to be a veiled warning.

 The Left has been pressuring the Centre not to side with the West at the International Atomic Energy Agencys November 24 meeting and vote to refer Irans nuclear programme to the UN Security Council.

 Officially, the Congress maintains the Iran vote would not precipitate a crisis for the government.

 There will be no such thing by which the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) allies within and outside shall feel any discomfort. Things will be taken care of by the highest level of leadership, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said.

 Sources close to the high command said whatever decision India takes on November 24, it will be neither pro-US nor anti-US. The decision will be taken in paramount national interest ? a line echoed by Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan at her press briefing.

 It is the suggestion of the Congress that the issue is extremely sensitive to the states and our friends in the Non-Aligned Movement. We are also extremely sensitive to the views expressed by the political parties and we are confident that all these views will be kept in mind. The government will take a decision in the best interests of the nation and the people. Natarajan stressed that national interest is not synonymous with US interest.

 Officials said the Prime Minister had already spelt out the Centres stand on the vote at the Saarc summit in Dhaka. Manmohan Singh had said Delhi would work for a broad-based consensus to avoid a vote. But if a vote became necessary, India would consider the issues being put to vote and make up its mind.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi is expected to meet senior party leaders tomorrow to work out a strategy for Parliaments winter session. 

 The core group ? made up by the Prime Minister, Sonia, Ahmed Patel, Shivraj Patil and P. Chidambaram ? which meets on Fridays, may discuss the Iran controversy at its next meeting.

 The more optimistic sections in the Congress and the government believe that the Lefts views on the Iran vote may actually increase Indias leverage with the West.

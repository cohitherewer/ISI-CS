 Lanka ministers uncle goes missing

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Sarath Amunugama

Bhopal, Sept. 5: Sri Lankan finance minister Sarath Amunugamas uncle had come on a visit to the famous Sanchi stupas, but he has gone missing from Bhopal railway station.

 According to a case registered with Government Railway Police, 83-year-old A.W. Amunugama disappeared from platform number one around 11.30 pm on August 25.

 Police SP Anant Kumar Singh said prima facie it did not appear to be a case of foul play. We have been told he was suffering from fading memory and perhaps boarded some wrong train.

 He said Amunugamas son had come looking for him and a case was registered. A manhunt has been launched and all police stations across the state have been alerted.

 According to the police, Amunugama was part of a 50-member tourist group that had come to see the stupas Emperor Asoka built in Lord Buddhas honour.

 Stupas are large hemispherical domes having a central chamber in which Buddhas relics are placed. The Sanchi stupas are one of Unescos heritage sites.

 Amunugama reached Bhopal on August 25 evening from Chennai by the 2156 G.T. Express 25, intending to go to Sanchi. 

 He got down at the railway station but never reached Sanchi, Singh said.

 His fellow travellers reached Sanchi and then proceeded to Delhi, but the old man remained untraced.

 When Amunugamas family members did not hear from him for days, they faxed a letter to Bhopal police last Saturday. Amunugamas son then came down and lodged a police complaint.

 We are taking all necessary steps to trace Amunugama. Descriptions of his physical appearance have been sent to all police stations in Madhya Pradesh, Singh said. 

 At the Sri Lankan finance ministers request, a large search party has been set up. Sarath is one of the ministers President Chandrika Kumaratunga has been confiding in since the assassination of Lakshman Kadirgamar.

 He was recently given additional charge of industrial and investment promotion, a portfolio Chandrikas brother Anura Bandaranaike was holding before he took charge of the foreign ministry.

 Sarath is a former civil servant. 

 Before joining politics, he was a highly placed official in the Unesco.

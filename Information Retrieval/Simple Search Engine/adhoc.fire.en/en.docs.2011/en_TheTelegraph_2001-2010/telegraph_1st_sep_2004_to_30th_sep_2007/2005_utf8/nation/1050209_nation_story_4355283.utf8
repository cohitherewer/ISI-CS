 Pension hope for governors

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Union home ministry is mulling over a consistent demand from governors to introduce the concept of pension benefits for governors.

 It is also proposed to give them allowances for secretarial staff and travel.

 Once they demit office, governors are only entitled to medical reimbursement from the government. Union home minister Shivraj Patil would like to change that and has asked the home ministry to take a close look at this subject.

 The concept, still on the home ministry?s drawing board, was to be put up for discussion at a two-day conference of governors initially slated to begin today. The conference, to be attended by 28 governors and three lieutenant-governors, has been deferred in view of the President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s suffering a fracture in his shoulder on Sunday.

 Officials said there had been a slew of requests from governors for a long time to give them benefits on the lines of those given to other functionaries of the government, right from the President to parliamentarians and legislators. Sources said the proposal was considered by the government at one stage but dropped after opposition from state governments at meetings of chief ministers under the inter-state council. One of the arguments given by the states was that such a move would impose an additional burden on their finances that were already in doldrums.

 There is a strong view in the home ministry that the proposal should nevertheless be revived as the ?weak finances of the states? was not a valid argument. It is being argued that the Central government could also think of creating a mechanism whereby it would reimburse the expenditure incurred by the states.

 Sources said the UPA government had already held some informal discussions on this issue. ?There was unanimity during these preliminary discussions that this subject needed to be pursued by the home ministry,? a source said.

 Encouraged by the response, the home ministry is also inclined to accept another demand made by the governors for additional allowances that would enable them to hire secretarial staff. It is also being proposed to give them a travelling allowance in view of their stature and contribution to governance in the country.

 Naga leader smells Delhi conspiracy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 30: Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), has accused the government of provoking the Nagas and security forces of closing in on them.

 The insurgent leader expressed concern over the governments decision to reinforce the presence of security forces in the hill districts of Manipur as well as those areas of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh where Nagas are present.

 The government had decreased the presence of security forces in the Naga-inhabited hills of Manipur because of the ceasefire with the NSCN (I-M). But now, old army posts everywhere are being reinforced; frisking, checking and arrests of people have gone up. What is the purpose of this deployment? Is this conducive to the peace process? This is clearly an attempt to provoke with the possible motive of closing in on the Nagas in anticipation of the situation getting worse, Muivah said.

 In the Zeliangrong Naga areas of Tameh and Nungpa in Manipur, the operational activities of the security forces have gone beyond limits in terms of harassing the local population. 

 On May 26, the chief executive member of the district council of Tamenglong was allegedly kidnapped by the NSCN (Khaplang). 

 Muivah claimed that members of the Khaplang group took the official to an Assam Rifles camp at Kotland, located on the Imphal-Tamenglong highway, the very next day. 

 It is almost clear that the commanders of Assam Rifles in the Manipur hills have been bought over by some elements in the state government opposed to the peace process. If India is given a free hand, it will be at its own peril, the NSCN (I-M) general secretary warned.

 There seem to be two reasons for the redeployment of the Assam Rifles in the Naga hills: the NSCN (I-M) is believed to have given shelter to some Meitei insurgents ? especially of the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) and the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL), both close to them ? in these areas. 

 Meitei insurgents from the PLA and the KYKL have indeed been allowed by the NSCN (I-M) to stay in the Naga areas, provided they are unarmed and do not use the opportunity to launch an attack on security forces, target the local population for extortion and move about openly. 

 These conditions were apparently laid down because of the ceasefire between the NSCN (I-M) and Delhi. The NSCN (I-M) argues that because such precautions had been taken, sheltering the Meitei insurgents should not be used as a pretext to harass its cadres.

 Muivah admitted that on his return to Dimapur after a series of talks with the government in Delhi, he had said that the Nagas should be prepared for any eventuality and that they should not be presumptuous. 

 However, he clarified: By ourselves we will not be on the offensive. But nor should we be expected to be passive.

 Muivah alleged that in Halflong, security forces were killing and arresting Nagas even when we have not created any situation warranting such action. On Friday, three NSCN (I-M) cadres were apparently shot dead by the armed forces at Tamjara near Harangkajao, 25 km from Halflong. What is the motive behind such acts? Do they think they can frighten the Nagas in this way? he asked.

 He said while he had given instructions to his cadres in Arunachal Pradesh not to do anything to disturb the peace process, yet the Khaplang people are at large with the Assam Rifles turning a blind eye. 

 Unless the developing situation is carefully dealt with, the worst may be imminent. The government of India is yet to demonstrate its wisdom in this situation, he warned.

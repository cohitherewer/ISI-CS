 Paswan faces Godhra heat 

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: Laloo Prasad Yadav today attacked Ram Vilas Paswan and the Congress frowned on him in a sign of the growing distance between the Lok Janshakti Party president and his United Progressive Alliance partners.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief weaned away two of Lok Janshaktis main Muslim leaders and publicly called Paswan the BJPs sleeping partner. 

 The Congress signalled that it no longer expects Paswan to be part of its secular alliance. Party general secretary Digvijay Singh said the Lok Janshakti presidents insistence on a Muslim chief minister for Bihar is unreasonable. Paswan maintains that Bihar needs to be rid of Laloo Prasad.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief welcomed Lok Janshakti general secretary and spokesperson Qamar Alam, national secretary Abdul Qayoom Ansari and their supporters into his party at a glittering function in Delhi.

 Although Paswans party described these leaders as insignificant functionaries who had already been expelled for indiscipline, Laloo Prasad described the development as yet another jolt to his colleague in the Union ministry. He attacked Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar and Paswan in the same breath and warned the largely Muslim gathering of the lurking danger of communalism.

 No one can forget the way our Muslim brothers were butchered in Gujarat. They did it in the name of Godhra, Laloo Prasad said. 

 And what was Godhra? Did our esteemed former railway minister (Nitish Kumar) even try and probe what led to the fire in the Sabarmati Express? Did he even visit the spot once?

 At that time, where were those who now claim they quit their cabinet berths on the Gujarat issue? Let us not forget that this honourable gentleman (Paswan) had no problem sticking with the BJP as long as he had the portfolio he desired. But then there was a small hitch. Pramod Mahajan came along and snatched his communications portfolio. So he had to quit the NDA (National Democratic Alliance). And suddenly he remembered Gujarat.

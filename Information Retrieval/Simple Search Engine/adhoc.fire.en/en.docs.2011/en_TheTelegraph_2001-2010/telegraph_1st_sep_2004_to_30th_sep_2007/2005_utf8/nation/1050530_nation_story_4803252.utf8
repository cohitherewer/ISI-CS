 Bomb scare at Gujarat secretariat

 Ahmedabad, May 29: Four countrymade bombs and 15 plastic bottles filled with petrol were found at gate number 6 of the Gujarat secretariat this morning, reports our correspondent.

 The bombs and petrol bottles found in the high-security zone were similar to those used by mobs during the 2002 riots in Ahmedabad.

 Police are clueless about how the explosives landed at the gate but the intention appeared to be to create panic, district police superintendent R.B. Brahmbhatt said.

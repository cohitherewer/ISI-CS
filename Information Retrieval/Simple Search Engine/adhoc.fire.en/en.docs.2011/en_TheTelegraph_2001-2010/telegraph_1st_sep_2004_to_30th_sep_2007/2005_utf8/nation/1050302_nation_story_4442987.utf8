 Atal vetoed on stalling House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 1: The 

 BJP today overruled Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s reservations 

 about disrupting Parliament proceedings and, along with 

 some allies, forced adjournment of both Houses over Goa.

 The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha were adjourned for the day without transacting any business following chaos as the presiding officers refused to admit an adjournment motion, which the National Democratic Alliance moved this morning, to discuss the political developments in Goa.

 The matter had come up for discussion at the BJP parliamentary party meeting, chaired by the former Prime Minister, that was held today before the House met.

 Vajpayee is understood to have said that the party should press for a discussion and not disrupt question hour or any other business in the House.

 Some party members, however, felt they should not be seen as adopting a ?soft stand? on such issues and should be aggressive. ?If the adjournment motion is not accepted, then hungama (furore) is the only option,? a member reportedly said.

 Vajpayee said he was apprehensive that such disruptions could set the ?wrong precedent? and affect Parliament?s functioning in the long run, but clarified he would go by the party?s decision, according to a BJP leader.

 BJP parliamentary party spokesperson V.K. Malhotra denied any internal differences and said Vajpayee wanted to ?press for a debate?.

 But Vajpayee again expressed unhappiness over stalling of proceedings, especially question hour, when he met Speaker Somnath Chatterjee later in the day, sources said.

 Earlier, however, the former Prime Minister blasted the United Progressive Alliance government and accused the Goa governor of ?murdering? democracy. He demanded fresh elections in the state.

 Chatterjee maintained that the NDA?s notice for the adjournment motion was ?not admissible? under House rules but said Goa ?is an important issue and should be debated on the floor of the House?.

 ?But a discussion,? he said, ?cannot be held against rules.? The Goa issue could have been discussed under other rules without adjourning parliamentary business as sought by the NDA, he added.

 ?If the leaders do not want the House to run, I am put in a lot of agony as the Speaker. It is not my House alone, it is the House of the people and their elected representatives,? Chatterjee said.

 ?I seek the cooperation of all parties and their leaders. On my own, I will not adjourn the House unless the parties agree.?

 Asked whether the Opposition had given any undertaking to allow the House to run smoothly in future, the Speaker said an ?undertaking was given when all of us, including the chair, took oath under the Constitution, which says the House should run properly?.

 The Congress branded the Opposition ?irresponsible? and asked its leadership to explain its assurance last year to presiding officers that it would not stall question hour.

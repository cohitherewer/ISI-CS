 Air show

 New Delhi, June 13: An Indian contingent led by the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, leaves for the Paris Air Show tomorrow to dangle one of the biggest orders for military aircraft in front of the worlds aviation majors, reports our special correspondent.

 Air Chief Marshal Tyagi and the team from the plans branch of the air force will be one of the most sought-after customers because they are scouting markets to issue contracts worth more than $5 billion upwards in a deal for 126 multi-role combat aircraft that air headquarters is currently vetting.

 Next month defence minister Pranab Mukherjee is slated to visit the US. Though he has said he is not going to the US with a shopping list he has also said that Washingtons interest to sell military hardware to India has led to a substantially altered situation for the Indian defence procurement system.

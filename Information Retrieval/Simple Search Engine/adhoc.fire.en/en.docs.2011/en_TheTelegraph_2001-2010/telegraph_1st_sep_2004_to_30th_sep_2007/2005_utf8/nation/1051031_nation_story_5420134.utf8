 Tug of war over bodies

 New Delhi, Oct. 30 (PTI): Anupam Gupta has just returned after cremating his wife. His three-year-old sons lifeless body lies at the mortuary, waiting for its last rites.

 But Gupta cannot take Utkarsh on his final journey as the relatives of an Indian Air Force sergeant, who died in the Sarojini Nagar explosion, have also laid claim to the body.

 Guptas friend Anil Saxena blamed police for the confusion. 

 Since we had made a positive identification yesterday when the body had not become coal black, what is the need of showing the body to another person today? he asked.

 An officer on the spot said it was the duty of the police to show bodies to anyone whose relative or friend is missing.

 Apurba Sharma, a tourist from Assam, faces the same predicament. 

 He has identified two bodies as those of his four-year-old daughter Upamani and eight-year-old niece Moitrye. But the sergeants family has laid a claim to Upamanis body as well. 

 Identification of bodies is turning into a serious problem in blast-hit Delhi with several charred beyond recognition.

 For the Gurgaon-based doctor Preeti Sahay, there is only a car she can lay claim to. Her husband Atul, also a doctor, has been missing since last evening. She has searched as many hospitals as her feet could take her to, but not one could give her any information.

 He had gone to Sarojini Nagar at about the time of the blasts but did not return or call me. His car is still standing at the market, Preeti said, tears welling up in her sleepless eyes.

 A relative of Preeti said they had seen two badly charred bodies, one of which could be Atuls. 

 We want DNA tests done as soon as possible but neither the doctors nor the police are telling us how to go about it, he complained.

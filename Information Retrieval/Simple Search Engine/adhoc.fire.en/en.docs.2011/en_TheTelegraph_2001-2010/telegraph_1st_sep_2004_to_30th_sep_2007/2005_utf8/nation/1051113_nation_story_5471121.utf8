 Fresh blood in lawyer team

 OUR BUREAU 

 Abu Salem

 Nov. 12: A lawyer from New Delhi will take over Abu Salems defence from Monday, .A. Siddiqui, who is handling the case now, revealed today.

 Mumbai-based Siddiqui, a little-known 

 lawyer who is one of many defending the Bombay blasts accused, 

 is seen as a surprise choice for Salem. In Hyderabad to 

 represent Monica Bedi, the lawyer said he would be in charge 

 till Monday. After that, Harjot Singh will take over.

 Siddiqui said Singh, who is now in Portugal, had approached him to take up the case and also paid the fees. At the moment, a team of five lawyers is defending the couple.

 Even before Salem and his companion were extradited, the gangsters legal advisers had reached India to set up his defence, sources said.

 Siddiqui and colleagues Pruthyush Tiwari and Shabana Shah landed today in Hyderabad, where Monica was taken last night to face a fake passport case, and staved off police custody. She has been sent to judicial custody, where the fear of torture during interrogation is thought to be less.

 The lawyer, who claimed the case against Monica was weak, returned to Mumbai tonight and is expected to go back to Hyderabad on Monday to file her bail plea. She is being charged with forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy.

 Salem was produced in a Tada (anti-terror law) court in Mumbai. Lawyers defending other accused in the Bombay blasts, in which the gangster is a main suspect, are worried his late entry will delay the case. Over 80 of the 200-odd accused have been heard and are awaiting the judgment.

 I hope the Salem case remains separate as the judgment against those who have been heard should not be postponed, said Farhana Shah, representing a majority of the accused who have been heard. 

 Some of the men I represent, like the poor fishermen from Raigad who carried some stuff in their trawlers, or labourers who just loaded goods into trucks, have been on bail, but unable to go back to normal life. The judgment hangs like a sword above them. Even if it is not favourable, the judgment should be given, as they will at least know.

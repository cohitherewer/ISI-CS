 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: Anil Mathranis sensational allegations have buoyed the BJP just when it had despaired of nailing the Centre on the Volcker report and begun looking for other issues.

 A perked-up BJP today indicated it would rock both Houses of Parliament throughout next week over the oil-for-food scandal. It demanded Sonia Gandhis resignation from the National Advisory Council, besides asking for immediate dismissal of Natwar Singh from the cabinet.

 The BJPs initial aggressiveness on the Iraq payoffs had petered out with the government effectively countering its campaign in the House. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambarams arguments in the Lok Sabha had led Opposition leader L.K. Advani to concede that had the government given its explanations earlier, the BJP would never have moved an adjournment motion.

 Its deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, announced yesterday that the NDA would discuss ways of debating the Mitrokhin papers in Parliament on Monday.

 But the Mathrani allegations changed the mood, with Malhotra accusing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of shamelessly defending the Congress and its top leaders. He alleged the Centre had prior knowledge of Natwars guilt but had kept it under wraps to shield higher-ups.

 The Prime Minister is getting involved in a cover-up. Natwar Singh should be dismissed and an FIR should be immediately registered against him, he said.

 Labour: civil courts lose say

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Supreme Court today ruled that labour courts and appellate tribunals under the Industrial Disputes Act should hear labour disputes and not civil courts.

 A division bench of Justices Ruma Pal and A.R. Lakshmanan said employees of a government corporation are not civil servants and the suits that they file in civil courts are not maintainable in law.

 The apex courts ruling, which has virtually taken away from civil courts the power to decide on labour matters, came on an appeal by the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation.

 The corporation had challenged the judgment of the high court, which had concurred with the trial court ruling holding the 1984 dismissal of a probationer, Zakir Hussain, as illegal and bad in law.

 The apex court said the lower courts had erred in ordering the reinstatement of the probationer with back wages. It said the respondent (employee) should have approached the remedies provided under the Industrial Disputes Act. 

 He has miserably failed to do so but approached the civil court, which, on the fact and circumstances of the case, has no jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit, the bench said.

 The ID act not only confers the right on a worker for reinstatement and back wages if order of the termination is not in accordance with the standing orders but also provides a detailed procedure and machinery for getting this relief.

 Under these circumstances, there is an apparent implied exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court, Justice A.R. Lakshmanan, who wrote the judgement for the bench, said.

 The Supreme Court maintained that workers of a corporation are not civil servants and as such their terms of employment are governed by their letters of employment.

 Therefore, the bench added: The management was well within its right to terminate the services of the respondent-probationer during the period of probation if his services were not found to be satisfactory during the said period.

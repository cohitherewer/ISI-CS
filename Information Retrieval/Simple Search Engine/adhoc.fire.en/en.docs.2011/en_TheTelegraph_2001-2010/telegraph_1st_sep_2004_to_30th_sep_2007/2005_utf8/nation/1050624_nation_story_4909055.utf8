 Damages in lost cellphone case

 New Delhi (PTI): The National Insurance 

 Company, which refused to pay the owner of a lost mobile 

 phone as she did not lodge an FIR, has been ordered by a 

 consumer court to pay the claim amount with compensation.

 The insurance company had repudiated Deepika Vermas claim stating that only a non-cognisable report was lodged mentioning that the cellphone was taken away by somebody while the claim covers only theft through force or violent entry or exit. 

 he court said: It is very clear that the theft took place. Twisting of words will not change the prima facie meaning of the crime. A layman is unable to differentiate between cognisable and non-cognisable offences.

 It has directed the insurance company to pay the college-goer a claim of Rs 8,700 and a compensation of Rs 2,000 for the harassment and mental agony caused to her.

 Vermas purse, containing her Nokia handset, was snatched when she was returning from her college. 

 Amarnath yatra postponed

 New Delhi: The home ministry has advised 

 Amarnath pilgrims to postpone their visit by at least 15 

 days, reports our special correspondent. 

 The advice comes in the wake of bad weather. Heavy snowfall has kept one of the two routes to the cave shrine out of bound. The yatra would resume for 45 days from July 6, it said.

 Of the two available routes, Baltal is open while the Pahalgam road remains closed. Even the Baltal route is not safe for the people to travel, the ministry said. 

 Rights rap

 New Delhi (PTI): The National Human 

 Rights Commission has criticised state governments for lack 

 of disabled-friendly infrastructure. Economic considerations 

 cannot be offered as excuse for not fulfilling constitutional 

 guarantees to put such infrastructure in place, it 

 said. There are 21.9 million disabled people in India.

 Shootout death

 New Delhi (PTI): One person was killed 

 and four policemen, including an inspector, injured in an 

 exchange of fire between police and robbers in northwest 

 Delhi on Thursday. Two robbers were arrested. The police 

 went to the area on receiving a complaint that the robbers 

 had barged into a house there.

 Honesty plea

 Srinagar (PTI): The state government 

 has urged people associated with tourism to deal honestly 

 with visitors. Crime against tourists in the country has 

 been on the rise.

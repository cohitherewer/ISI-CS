 Disaster duty bill on table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: From now on, all citizens above 18 may have to undergo civil defence training so that they can help during disasters caused by tsunamis, earthquakes, floods and the like.

 The parliamentary standing committee on home affairs has said that such training should be provided in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution.

 Article 51A (d) of the Constitution, which deals with fundamental duties, says: It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so.

 The home ministry has forwarded the committees recommendations ? made in connection with the Disaster Management Bill, 2005 ? to the National Disaster Management Authority, headed by the Prime Minister.

 The committee, headed by Sushma Swaraj, wants a relief commissioner in every district with the sole job of overseeing relief and rehabilitation in disaster-hit areas. If enacted, the recommendation will require 600 additional relief commissioners to be appointed in the country.

 The House panel ? which has 42 MPs, including L.K. Advani and Rahul Gandhi, as members ? also wants a project implementation agency in every state and Union territory.

 The committee also wants the chief executive officer of every autonomous district council in a northeastern state to be nominated co-chairman of the district disaster management authority in that area.

 After the recommendations are reviewed by the National Disaster Management Authority, the home ministry will present the disaster management bill in Parliament. The bill is likely to be tabled in the next session, a senior home ministry official said.

 Calcutta link in US threat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 24: The US has threatened economic sanctions if India does not urgently address the problem of girl trafficking, naming Calcutta and Mumbai as the cities with the worst record in combating the crime.

 US ambassador David Mulford met home minister Shivraj Patil a few days ago to discuss trafficking of women and children in India because it figured in a category of countries as stipulated by a US law.

 The US Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act classifies countries in Tiers I to III on the basis of their track record in combating such crimes.

 India is in Tier II, the watchlist. But it is likely to slip to Tier III, the worst-offender category that faces US sanctions, unless it notches up an impressive number of convictions against traffickers.

 Mumbai, says the US, has managed only 11 convictions and Calcutta 15; Chennai at 91 and New Delhi have a better record.

 Washington will otherwise be forced to vote against loans to India from international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and the ADB. The US may also suspend bilateral assistance to India.

 The US embassy here has already sent its annual report to Washington on last year?s trafficking conditions in India. A decision is likely in June.

 Unhappy with the US threat, India has said that ?politicising? the issue will not help improve anti-trafficking measures.

 ?India cooperates with a number of countries and international agencies on transnational criminal issues, including terrorism and illegal narcotics trade. This has been the case with the US as well,? foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said.

 ?Trafficking in persons was added to the ongoing dialogue between the two countries a year ago,? he added.

 Sarna emphasised it would also not be ?accurate? to say trafficking was being considered seriously only after Mulford?s meeting with the home minister.

 ?Trafficking in persons is an issue that is of priority concern to us. The department of women and child development provides policy leadership on this subject and a central advisory committee addresses related issues,? he said.

 ?To interpret our efforts to combat trafficking as responding to the pressures of a foreign government does not do justice to our own organisations concerned.?

 Sarna, however, said that India, as part of its larger cooperation with the US, was considering related training programmes and workshops.

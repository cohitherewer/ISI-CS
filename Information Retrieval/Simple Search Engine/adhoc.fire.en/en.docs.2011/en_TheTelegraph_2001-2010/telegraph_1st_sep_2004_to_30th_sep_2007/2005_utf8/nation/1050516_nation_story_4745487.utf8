 Uma meets Advani

 New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): Ending her self-imposed seclusion in the Amarkantak forests, BJP leader Uma Bharti tonight met party president L.K. Advani at his residence here apparently seeking rehabilitation in the party.

 Uma, who was closeted with Advani for more than two hours along with Swadeshi Jagran Manch convener S. Gurumurthy, said later that nothing political was discussed. The newly-appointed chief of the BJPs Madhya Pradesh unit, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who is viewed as a critic of Uma, was also present.

 Please do not attach any political meaning to this meeting. I just briefed him (Advani) on my experiences at Amarkantak, Uma said, adding It was just a courtesy call. A daughter had come to meet her father. 

 Asked if she is getting any party post, she said: I have told you what transpired.... If you feel I am hiding something, you can ask Advaniji.

 Asked about the cabinet expansion in Madhya Pradesh, Uma said she would not interfere in the process, as it was the prerogative of chief minister Babulal Gaur.

 Earlier in the day, Uma told reporters that she had never demanded any post in the party and welcomed the appointment of Chauhan as Madhya Pradesh state unit chief.

 I have never demanded any post in the party. I will prefer to die rather than ask for something. Anybody suggesting so is the biggest liar in the world, she said. She had said she only sought some work in the party, Uma added.

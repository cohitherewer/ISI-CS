 Cops leave man under coal heap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Feb. 14: An accident victim lay buried under a heap of coal for over 12 hours on a national highway before a sceptical police force returned to the spot and stumbled on his body.

 The incident occurred when a truck loaded with coal skidded off National Highway 2 near Panagarh in Burdwan and overturned on the 35-year-old man. His identity has not been established. 

 A police team reached the spot soon after the accident at 7.30 am but did not pay heed to bystanders? appeals to help the man buried under the coal, eyewitnesses said.

 The police squad, led by a sub-inspector from Kanksha police station, towed away the truck with the help of a crane and left the spot, leaving behind the man under the pile of coal.

 Around 8 pm ? more than 12 hours after the accident ? another police team reached the spot to clear away the coal because it was blocking a part of the highway.

 While the coal was being loaded onto a carrier, the body was noticed.

 ?The body was seen when the coal was being loaded on to another truck. Soon, onlookers turned violent. They chased the policemen who had no option but to take refuge in a hotel nearby,? said Rajesh Kumar Jadav, the sub-divisional police officer, Durgapur.

 A section of the people also blocked the highway. They later staged a demonstration in front of the police station, demanding immediate punishment for the sub-inspector. 

 ?They withdrew the demonstration when I passed on a message of the superintendent of police that the officer would be suspended within a day or two,? Jadav said.

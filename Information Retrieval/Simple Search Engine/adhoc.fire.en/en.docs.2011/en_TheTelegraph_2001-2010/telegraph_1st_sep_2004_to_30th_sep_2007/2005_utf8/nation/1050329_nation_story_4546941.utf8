 Thackeray PA drunk: Report

 Mumbai, March 28: Mumbai police today said blood tests have revealed that Ravindra Mhatre, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray?s personal assistant, was drunk when he rammed his car into four pedestrians on Saturday, reports our correspondent.

 Mhatre was arrested yesterday on charges of rash and negligent driving after his Ford Ikon killed two women and injured two persons. 

 But he was granted bail by a metropolitan court as the police did not apply Section 304 Part II for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

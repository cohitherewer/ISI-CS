 NDA warms up for winter

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: The NDA is rolling up its sleeves to take on the UPA government when the winter session of Parliament begins on Wednesday. But in a marked change of strategy, the Opposition coalition has decided there will not be any more boycotts.

 Three factors have apparently brought about the change: the prospects of victory over Laloo Prasad Yadav in Bihar and a Supreme Court ruling against governor Buta Singh for recommending the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly in February, and the Left-UPA contradictions over the Iran vote.

 While the NDA counted its possible gains, Congress sources said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party president Sonia Gandhi were worried on all three counts.

 Bihar has been giving the Congress sleepless nights ever since the apex court struck down the dissolution of the House as unconstitutional. The court is expected to release a detailed order on Tuesday. That day, another crucial verdict will be delivered ? that of the states electorate.

 BJP leader S.S. Ahluwalia said the NDA would demand the Prime Ministers resignation. It would also ask for a discussion under rules 173 and 184 in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, respectively, as both entail voting, he said. 

 While there was no official response from the Congress, a Rajya Sabha member said the governments best bet was a victory for the NDA in Bihar or at least a single-largest majority. In that case, the governor has no choice but to invite the leader of the coalition to form the government. Then the apex courts observations will become the subject of an academic discussion without over-arching political ramifications, he said. 

 If the UPA seems to be at sea in Bihar, the water is no less choppy in Delhi, where the Left is flexing its muscles on the Iran vote. Sources said the government is clear that it cannot reverse its vote at the International Atomic Energy Agency or be seen to communalise its foreign policy by pleasing Iran. 

 Singh and Sonia are believed to have told Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who was hosting a dinner ahead of the winter session, that the Congress is unwilling to discuss the Mitrokhin papers in Parliament. They said there was no truth in the papers, which alleged that Russias KGB had funded some parties and their leaders in India during Cold War, and the House cannot discuss fiction.

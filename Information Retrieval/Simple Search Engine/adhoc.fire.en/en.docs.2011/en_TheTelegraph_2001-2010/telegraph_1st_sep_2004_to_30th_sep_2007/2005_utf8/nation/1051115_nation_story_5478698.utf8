 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Infotech may be hogging the limelight, but Bengals economic turnaround hinges on big-ticket investments in iron and steel, chemicals and processed food in the near future, according to state industry minister Nirupam Sen.

 The state government is hoping that such investments could add up to over Rs 10,000 crore and make Bengal one of the most favoured investment destinations in the country. 

 Iron and steel will remain the real big-ticket investments in the state. We have commitments for about Rs 7,000 crore in this sector alone. Food processing is another major sector where we have attracted about Rs 1,200 crore, Sen said.

 The industry ministers point was that despite the hype about infotech growth in the state, money is actually coming into basic manufacturing sectors. IT brought in just Rs 500 crore in investments. We talk about services sector turning into a major economy driver but that is because of the combined growth of IT with the construction and financial sectors.

 The minister, who was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised by Ficci here, said the state government was looking forward to investments from Mitsubishi, which is planning an expansion of its existing chemicals plant in the state.

 Two new motorcycle plants ? one by the Indonesians and another by Chinese investors ? and greenfield investments by Tata Steel and Tata Metaliks are also coming up, he added.

 Industry officials pointed out that the state-run SAIL was planning to invest about Rs 2,500 crore in IISCO over the next three to five years.

 Sen pointed out that we have the third largest economy in the country and the second highest per capita growth. In terms of industrial investments, Bengal is second only to Gujarat.

 Centre drafts bill to check race hatred

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Centre is planning a law to check the spread of communal hatred.

 The home ministry is already preparing a draft bill, on the recommendations of the National Commission for Minorities.

 The bill would, among other things, suggest a ban on all provocative speeches ? by politicians, religious leaders or individuals ? commission sources said.

 Once the commission gets the draft bill, it would hold a dialogue with religious leaders of minority communities and, if necessary, with Hindu leaders as well. A law would be enacted only after thorough debate.

 ?We demand introduction of a separate anti-hate bill so that there will be provision for punishing those who propagate hatred amongst communities,? commission chairperson Tarlochan Singh said.

 ?Most of the communal tensions begin with the malicious writings and utterances of certain people. Such a law would be pre-emptive as it can prevent outbreak of communal violence,? Singh added.

 Terming religious processions as ?the main cause? of communal violence, Singh demanded that these should not be allowed in communally sensitive areas. If at all a march is permitted, a written undertaking should be sought from the parties concerned that it will not trigger violence.

 ?Before giving permission for religious processions, the deputy commissioner of the area should call a meeting of all communities to clear any misunderstandings and take steps to prevent any clashes,? Singh said, adding that provisions for videographing the procession should be made.

 Melting-pot marvel takes a blow

 Lucknow, Oct. 9: With four minarets and an octagonal lantern of slate and marble on the central dome, it could be an Islamic monument. But it has steeples, spires and a statue of the Virgin Mary as well ?under the same roof as that of a queen dressed as a Muslim Begum.

 Northern Indias oldest Roman Catholic church at Sardhana, 19 km northwest of Meerut, stands as an architectural and historical marvel, bearing testimony to how cultures can weld. But Saturdays earthquake took away some of the shine.

 Two of the minarets are badly damaged and the plaster has fallen off the walls. Church authorities fear the cracks inside the walls may have widened, worsening the seepage.

 We have invited a team of engineers from Dehra Dun to inspect the building thoroughly, a church spokesman said.

 When we heard the earth rumbling, we rushed out to the street, praying to God to save this historic shrine, said Robin Das, a priest.

 But as the entire building shook vehemently, said another eyewitness, huge chunks fell off two minarets. A womans figure on one of the arches, too, crumbled.

 Its not clear if there are invisible cracks or any damage to the churchs inner designs. Only specialists would be able to say how serious the damage is inside, said subdivisional magistrate Pinky Joval, who inspected the site under instructions from Meerut district magistrate Ram Kishan.

 A senior member of the North Indian Roman Catholic Church Committee expressed shock at the damage to the church, built by a Muslim ruler who had converted to Christianity.

 Begum Samru became a Roman Catholic in 1781, three years after the death of her husband, French adventurer Walter Reinhardt, who had acquired Sardhana from the ruler of Delhi in 1773. Reinhardt had come to be known as Samru.

 The church, designed by Italian architect Anthony Reghelini, cost an astronomical Rs 4 lakh in 1822. The earth dug up as building material created two huge lakes nearby.

 The church is an imposing building with two steeples, each ending in a lofty spire. On the left are two large bells. Eighteen Doric pillars line the verandah. Atop the three domes and two spires are heavily gilded metal balls mounted with metal crosses. 

 The octagonal lantern above the central dome is a reminder of the influence of Islamic architecture in the shrines design. It is made of finely chiselled and perforated slate, and is capped with black and white marble.

 The main altar is of white marble brought from Jaipur, and is inlaid with a floral design of semi-precious stones. The altar steps and sanctuary floor are of white and black marble. Above the niche is the statue of Mary, to whom the church was dedicated.

 On either side of the sanctuary there is a long wing. The left wing houses the famous monument over the Begums tomb.

 The 18-foot carrara marble monument features 11 lifesize figures and three panels in bas-relief. Right on top, the Begum sits in state, dressed in Islamic robes.

 Immediately below her stand four figures. Further below are six symbolic figures, representing the fearlessness, wisdom, fulfilment and prosperity that marked the Begums reign, said a local resident.

 The sacred image of the Lady of Graces was enshrined in 1957, adding to the shrines architectural grandeur and fame. International recognition came in 1961, with Pope John XXIII raising the church to the status of Minor Basilica.

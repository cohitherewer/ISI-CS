 Calcutta, Dec. 3: Chief Justice of India Y.K. Sabharwal today expressed the need to engage retired judges and former government officials who held high ranks to dispose of petty criminal cases.

 More than 2.6 crore cases are lying with different courts of the country, of which 1.8 crore are criminal cases. Ninety per cent of total criminal cases are petty in nature, where penalty is only a fine. These cases can be easily handled by retired judges and high-ranking government officers, the chief justice said after inaugurating the West Bengal Judicial Academy at Salt Lake.

 The judge said he was aware of the problem arising out of vacancies in posts of judges. This problem will have to be solved by us, he added.

 Justice Sabharwal also hoped that the idea of setting up judicial academies to train subordinate court judges and higher judicial administrators would help minimise the problems of common litigants.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who was present at the programme, expressed his concern over piling of cases in courts. He stressed that the judiciary should pay heed to cases where cyber crime is involved. The law courses should include a chapter on the handling of cyber crimes, he said.

 Bhattacharjee said his government had taken all steps to provide infrastructure facilities to the judiciary. 

 Forty-five new court buildings across the state have already been constructed, he said. Today, he formally announced that his government had allotted a 5-acre plot in Rajarhat for the judicial academy.

 Calcutta High Court Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and all sitting judges of the high court were present at the programme. So were Supreme Court judges Ruma Pal and S.B. Sinha.

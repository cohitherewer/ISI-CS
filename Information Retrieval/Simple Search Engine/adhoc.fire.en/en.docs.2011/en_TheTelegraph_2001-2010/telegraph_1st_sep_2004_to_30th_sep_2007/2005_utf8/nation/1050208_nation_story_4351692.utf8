 Jet, Sahara for Asean

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb. 7: The government today gave Jet Airways and Air Sahara a daily flight each to Asean hotspots Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, saying more could not be given as most routes are already being used by state-run carriers Air-India and Indian Airlines.

 In all, Jet and Sahara have wangled 14 flights each to the Southeast Asian region. Last week, Jet had stormed into global skies by cornering the lion?s share of new flights between India and London. 

 The private airlines will start flying to these destinations in summer, depending on how soon they are able to induct new planes. 

 The government had allotted seven flights a week to Heathrow to Jet Airways and two a week to Air Sahara to fly to Gatwick. 

 Air-India was given three more flights to Heathrow, with the rider that it might lose these if it is unable to get time slots at the airport.

 Air-India and Indian Airlines were today allowed to raise their seat offerings to various Asean destinations. They can use up the higher allotments by flying larger aircraft or by adding new time slots. 

 Jet and Sahara have been allowed a flight a day each from Chennai to Kuala Lumpur, a lucrative route which sees aircraft flying with over 80 per cent seats filled. Jet has also bagged permission for a daily Mumbai-Singapore flight, while Sahara has been allowed to fly Delhi-Singapore. These two are considered high-profit routes.

 The two airlines had also sought to fly to Thailand and Hong Kong. However, the government was unable to help as Indian Airlines and Air-India are already operating the maximum number of flights Indian carriers can fly to Thailand.

 Hong Kong has refused to allow any third Indian carrier to fly to that country. 

 The Chinese-ruled island has said it will only permit the two state-run airlines to fly there. 

 Meetings are scheduled to decide on flights to the US. The government can award more flights to the US, but only after a deal struck with Washington on new flights is ratified by the legislatures of the two countries.

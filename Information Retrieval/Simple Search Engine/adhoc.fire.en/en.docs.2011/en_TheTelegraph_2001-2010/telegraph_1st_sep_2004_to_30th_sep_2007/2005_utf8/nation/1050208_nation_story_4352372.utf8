 Hyderabad tiger killer in net

 Hyderabad: A 22-year-old was arrested 

 on Sunday for his alleged role in killing and skinning a 

 Royal Bengal Tiger on October 4, 2000, reports our special 

 correspondent.

 Mohammed Salauddin and Ahmed Samad had scaled the fence of the 140-acre Nehru Zoological Park in the old city, where Sakhi lived with 13 more wild cats, police said. 

 ?The killers used a noose to catch the youngest cat and killed the animal by cutting its jugular while in cage. Later, they took out the wild cat and skinned it in the presence of its mother, brother and a sister,? police commissioner Dinesh Reddy said.

 The Andhra Pradesh government had announced a Rs 4 lakh award to track down the killers.

 ?The cats had roared through the night but failed to catch the attention of the security personnel in the zoo. Salauddin and Samad had spent over four hours till dawn to cut the skin and the claws for monetary gain,? said Rajiv Trivedi, the additional commissioner of police.

 Salauddin, a regular offender, had three non-bailable warrants pending against him in poaching and sandalwood smuggling cases. ?Even now, we caught him for some other offence and, during interrogation, he confessed to his crime,? Trivedi said. Samad, who had shifted base to Mumbai, is said to have committed suicide last year.

 A state-level commission that inquired into the Sakhi killing had found ?very lax security in the zoo and also connivance of the zoo staff?.

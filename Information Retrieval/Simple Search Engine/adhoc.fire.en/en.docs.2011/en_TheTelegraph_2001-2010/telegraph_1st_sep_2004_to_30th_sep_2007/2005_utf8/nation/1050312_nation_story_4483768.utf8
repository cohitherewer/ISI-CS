 Drumbeat din forces tax arrears pay-up

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Rajahmundry, March 11: Tax defaulters in an Andhra Pradesh town are being forced to face the music with authorities hiring drummers to play non-stop outside their homes until they pay up.

 After many Rajahmundry residents ignored repeated demands to settle overdue property taxes through circulars, phone calls and email, the municipal corporation has sent groups of drummers to play outside the offenders? houses.

 ?We hired bands of drummers to beat the devil out of the defaulters. They put up a spectacle outside the houses of defaulters, draw them out and explain their dues to them and the need to clear it at the earliest,? said Rajahmundry municipal commissioner T.S.R. Anjaneyulu. 

 ?They don?t stop until people agree to clear the dues.?

 Over 20 groups of drummers, popularly called dappu, were hired over the past week. ?Their presence in front of the houses was a cause for social embarrassment to the defaulters,? another civic body official said.

 Anjayya, a drummer from a group that hounded the Durga colony, said: ?We did not move away till the defaulter conceded defeat and paid up.? Each successful team was given special incentives.

 The corporation had been at its wit?s end after property dues of up to Rs 5 crore piled up and sops like waiving interest and penalties had failed to recover the arrears.

 The new method seems to be working, though. One week of incessant drumming has cleared 18 per cent of the backlog. ?The exercise has been successful in the first week of operation,? Anjaneyulu said.

 The civic body is resorting to other methods as well. ?We have installed teams at temples and cultural centres to announce the names of chronic defaulters through public address systems,? its chief said.

 Civic bodies in the state are under pressure to improve property tax collection. ?The recovery rate has become a benchmark of their efficiency and eligibility for procuring loans cum grants from the World Bank-aided Andhra urban infrastructure fund,? said Veena Ish, state secretary for municipal administration.

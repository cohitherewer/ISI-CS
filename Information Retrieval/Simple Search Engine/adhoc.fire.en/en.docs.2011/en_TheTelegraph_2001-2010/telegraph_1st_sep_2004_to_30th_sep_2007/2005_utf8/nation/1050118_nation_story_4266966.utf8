 Pollution link in child cancer 

 London, Jan. 17 (Reuters): Most childhood cancers are probably caused by exposure in the womb to environmental and industrial pollutants that have been inhaled by the mother, a British researcher said today.

 George Knox, an emeritus professor at the University of Birmingham in England, compared birth and death records of children who had died from cancer with a chemical emissions map of Britain. He found that children born within a kilometre?s radius of chemical emission hotspots were two to four times more likely to die of cancer before reaching 16 than other children.

 ?Most childhood cancers are probably initiated by close perinatal (around birth) encounters with one or more of these high-emission sources,? said Knox.

 Being born near high-emission sites of organic compounds, carbon monoxide and 1,3-butadiene carried the highest risks. Carbon monoxide is a product of internal combustion engines and 1,3-butadiene is used to manufacture synthetic rubber and is also a product of internal combustion engines. ?These diseases are determined very early in life, probably prenatally,? Knox said. 

 ?They are related to atmospheric emissions that are probably absorbed by the mother and passed across the placenta.?

 Particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, which are linked to oil burning and compou- nds such as benzene, benz(a)pyrene and dioxins were also mentioned in the study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

 But Dr Lesley Walker of the charity Cancer Research, UK, said the evidence in the study is very thin. ?A wealth of information suggests that leukaemia, the most common type of cancer in children, may be a rare response to an unidentified but common infection. This is a complex area to research ? not least because cancers in children are rare and some may have an underlying genetic basis,? she said.

 The maps used by Knox were produced by the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory.

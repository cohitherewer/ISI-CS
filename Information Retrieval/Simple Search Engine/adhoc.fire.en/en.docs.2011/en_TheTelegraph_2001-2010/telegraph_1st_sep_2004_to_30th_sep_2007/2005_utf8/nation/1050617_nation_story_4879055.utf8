 Rashid ready for Srinagar

 Islamabad, June 16 (PTI): Pakistan information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad today said he would go ahead with his proposed bus journey to Srinagar on June 30 as it would be a test between those supporting the peace process and those obstructing it.

 A controversy has been raging over reports that he used to run a training camp for militants.

 There are certain newspapers which play different roles, probably under directions... from someone. They have been defeated, as truth will remain truth. I am going by the June 30 bus, the minister told reporters while bidding farewell to Kashmiri separatist leaders who left Pakistan after a fortnight-long visit. 

 Ahmad said his journey was also a test for the confidence-building measures between the two countries. I am sure the Indian government will give me permission to travel by the bus, he told a television channel last night.

 He had not received any information on the permission but I am ready to go to Srinagar, he said.

 Pakistans prominent Opposition parties and former top generals have joined those confirming Ahmads alleged role in running the camp. 

 The controversy erupted two days ago with reported remarks of visiting JKLF leader Yasin Malik that Ahmad had organised a camp for 3,500 militants at Rawalpindi when militancy in Jammu and Kashmir was at its peak.

 The information minister has denied the allegation.

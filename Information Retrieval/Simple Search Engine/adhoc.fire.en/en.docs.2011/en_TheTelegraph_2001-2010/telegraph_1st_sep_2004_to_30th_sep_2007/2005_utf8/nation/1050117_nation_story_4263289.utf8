 Bahanaga (Balasore), Jan. 16: In the sea of illiteracy at Madnapur village in Bahanaga block of Balasore district, an unemployed youth stands as the island of hope.

 Thirty-one-year-old Bikash Satpathy has been waging a battle against ignorance for the past 14 years. His weapon ? a library with a collection of over 30,000 books. 

 Loknath Library, set up in a room at his father?s house, is the gateway to a world of knowledge for the people of not only Madnapur ? where life is a never-ending fight for survival ? but also for those who live in nearby places.

 At the age of 16, Satpathy completed his matriculation and got admitted in Upendranath College at Soro for his Plus Two. He soon developed a liking for writing, but on the advice of a teacher, he shelved his ambitious plans and instead focused on reading. 

 Such was Satpathy?s passion for books that he did not want to apply for a job after completing his postgraduation in Oriya from Utkal University. When he told his ageing father Bishnumohan ? a farmer ? that he wanted to open a library, the latter disapproved. ?What will you gain from it,? he had asked. 

 Undeterred, Satpathy kept adding to his collection ? at times pestering his author friends for books. He eventually succeeded in getting the support of his parents. 

 Now, the youth?s life revolves around the library, named after his grandfather Loknath Satpathy. ?This is my greatest legacy,? Satpathy says. 

 The library, which made a small beginning, was an offshoot of a Bhagabat Tungi (traditional religious gathering of elderly people) run by Satpathy?s grandfather. 

 The library was set up in 1990 with a collection of only 200 books. Now, it has books in Oriya, English, Hindi, Bengali and Telugu. The collection includes fiction, poetry, biography, reference, magazines and periodicals. 

 The Oriya collection features books written by eminent authors like Fakir Mohan Senapati, Gangadhar Meher and Laxmikanta Mohapatra. The Oriya collection has more than 2,000 titles. 

 The English collection, which has more than 1,500 titles, includes the works of Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore and the autobiography of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and some periodicals published between 1925 and 1936. 

 The library remains open between 6 am and 10 pm and readers do not have to pay anything to use the facilities. 

 A visit to the library is a unique experience for residents of Madnapur ? which has a literacy rate of around 40 per cent ? and neighbouring villages. 

 ?It?s a boon for us,? says Saroj Kumar Dash of Talapada village. ?This library has more books than my college library,? opines Purna Chandra Nayak, an accountant in a local college.

 The collection is not limited to books alone. The library also has an interesting collection of palm leaf manuscripts, some as old as 300 years, caps worn by navy, police and army personnel in the past, stamps, coins, spears and animal hides.

 Satpathy received the rare manuscripts from his grandfather. A team from INTACH recently surveyed the library and the manuscripts. The stamps are from 16 countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, United States and Indonesia. 

 Satpathy has also published a few collections, including Manisha, Maha Pralaya, Sunya Lahari and Utkal Santana. He has built a network of sources ? relatives, friends and acquaintances ? who help him acquire books, spears and the other items one can find in the library.

 Besides the wholehearted support ? monetary and otherwise ? of Satpathy?s family members, contributions from eminent writers and publishing houses also help keep the library afloat.

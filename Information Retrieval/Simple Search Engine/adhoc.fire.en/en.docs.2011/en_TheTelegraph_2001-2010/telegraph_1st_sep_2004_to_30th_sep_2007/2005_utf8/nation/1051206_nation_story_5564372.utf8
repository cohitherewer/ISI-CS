 Monica burqa unveils misuse protest

 Monica: Security shield

 Bhopal, Dec. 5: Monica Bedi was put in police remand for two days by the judicial magistrate here while a Muslim leader protested the polices move to bring her in a burqa.

 Ausaf Shamiri, president of the All India Muslim Tehuar (festivals) Committee, said the use of a burqa to hide a criminals identity was not in good taste. 

 Islam accords a lot of importance to a womans modesty and such a dress code should not be misused, Shamiri said, adding that he would take it up at the appropriate level.

 The starlet, don Abu Salems companion, was brought here from Hyderabad in connection with a fake passport case. Salem, his wife, Samira Jumani, and Monica had allegedly got fake passports in the names of Danish Beig, Rubina Beig and Fauzia Usman, respectively, in July 2001 from here.

 Monica arrived here in the early hours today. She was brought in the New Delhi-bound Andhra Pradesh Express under heavy security and was made to get off at Itarsi station, 120 km from here, and then driven to Bhopal. 

 Magistrate Dinesh Kumar Dangi granted formal approval to the state police crime branch to arrest Monica. Her uncle Purushottam Bedi and advocate Sudhir Batra were present during the hearing. Monica was not produced in person due to security reasons. 

 Salem brother plea

 Salems brother Abu Lais today moved the Tada court in Mumbai seeking permission to meet the don. Lais said he and his brother-in-law be allowed to meet Salem, who is in police custody till December 17 in the Pradeep Jain murder case. The court has asked the police to reply by Thursday.

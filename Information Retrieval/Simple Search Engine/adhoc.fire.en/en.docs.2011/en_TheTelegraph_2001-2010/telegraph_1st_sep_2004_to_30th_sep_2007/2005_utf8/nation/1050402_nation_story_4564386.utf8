 Bengal, Assam seat shuffle 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, April 1: Work on delimitation of constituencies in five states headed for polls in April-May next year ? including Bengal and Assam ? will be completed by July, an Election Commission official said today.

 Poll panel legal adviser S.K. Mendiratta said the delimitation commission?s final reports on Goa and Pondicherry were published yesterday. The draft report for Kerala was ready and would be finalised after the commission holds a public sitting in that state on April 23, he said.

 Mendiratta is heading a three-member team to Tamil Nadu to study the feasibility of holding Assembly bypolls in Kancheepuram and Gummidipoondi, which fell vacant in November after the death of the sitting ADMK legislators.

 As the constituencies are located in the tsunami-hit districts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvallore, the panel is keen to find out if bypolls will hamper relief and rehabilitation. Mendiratta will visit the districts tomorrow.

 After the draft proposal is finalised and published in the official gazette, the President has to notify the date from which the redrawn boundaries will take effect.

 Goa and Pondicherry are awaiting the President?s notification.

 ?With other states also we will complete the job soon, but it is up to the President to notify the date,? he said.

 The delimitation exercise in Tamil Nadu, also headed for polls early next year, has run into a roadblock with some Opposition parties, including the DMK, raising objections. Efforts are on to iron out the difficulties.

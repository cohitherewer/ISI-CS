 Manisha defends king

 Kathmandu, May 31: A selfless king risks his crown to save his people from anarchy; a band of opportunists combine to thwart his plans.

 That, according to Bollywood actor Manisha Koirala, is how the script has unfolded in her country over the past four months.

 A week after her father was expelled from the Nepali Congress for supporting the royal takeover, the film star has lambasted the political parties for opposing King Gyanendra, saying he alone can restore peace and stability in the country. 

 In an interview to the state-owned news agency Rashtriya Samachar Samiti, Manisha has described her father Prakash Koirala as a strong nationalist and the cleanest leader among the current politicians, claiming he was targeted for dissent.

 It is unfortunate that those who preach democracy cannot tolerate anybody who differs with them, she said in the interview, which was front-paged today by the royal governments mouthpiece daily, Rising Nepal.

 The interview takes on the dimensions of a family drama with the actor pointing fingers at her great-uncle and former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, head of the Nepali Congress, which is spearheading the all-party anti-monarch agitation.

 In the interview, done over email, Manisha claims King Gyanendras February 1 royal coup was intended to stop anarchy.

 We have all seen how the situation had deteriorated after the royal massacre (the palace carnage four years ago). Some vested interests groups have created doubts and were trying to cash (in) on it. Our beloved and respected king had to take the step to stop anarchy, she said, adding that the king was a paragon of selflessness who put the monarchy at stake to stop the country from falling apart.

 The political parties, she alleged, were to blame for Nepals misfortunes. In the name of fighting for peoples rights, the political parties are actually fighting to be in power. 

 If they are genuinely interested in peoples welfare, they should jointly launch a movement against the Maoists in the affected villages.

 She cited how most politicians own huge properties, fancy cars and bank accounts in Nepal and abroad.

 As for the Maoist insurgency, the film star felt it could be solved either through dialogue or army action. The Maoists should give up violence and fight elections, she said.

 Manisha said she would be happy to act in Nepali feature films. She was waiting for the right offer to come along.

 Buta on hiring drive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 11: Governor Buta Singh could be inviting trouble with his instruction to Bihar officials to recruit necessary government staff after simplifying the entry process.

 His directive to chief secretary K.A.H. Subramaniam followed several departments? complaint that they were short-staffed.

 Today, Singh emphasised that vacancies for policemen should be filled at the earliest with provision for proper training.

 Recruitment of general staff and police personnel, pending for long, has turned out to be a knotty issue, with some earlier attempts having been challenged in courts over unfairness in the selection procedure and differences over eligibility criteria. 

 Further, the cash-strapped government had been reluctant to take up any major recruitment drive.

 Continuing his meetings with top officials for the third day today, the governor focused on law and order in keeping with his resolve to improve it. He said police stations would be equipped to ensure there are no failings in the ?priority? area.

 He also took stock of around 15 departments. ?You have to work with commitment to make Bihar a modern state,? Singh told the officials. The progress of each department, he said, would be reviewed at regular intervals.

 Patna?s civic condition came up for a special discussion when the governor asked the urban development secretary to clean the city of filth and mosquitoes within a timeframe. The officer sought 15 days to improve the situation.

 Singh also sought information on the health department such as the status of doctors and employees, and availability of drugs. The health secretary said lack of staff was a major hurdle in reaching medical aid to the poor.

 This prompted the heads of other departments to say that paucity of manpower was a big problem. The governor?s direction to the chief secretary followed.

 Singh said if proposals for hiring staff were pending a decision, these could now be moved for necessary assent.

 Yesterday, he had said transparency was the key to effective administration and essential for winning people?s confidence.

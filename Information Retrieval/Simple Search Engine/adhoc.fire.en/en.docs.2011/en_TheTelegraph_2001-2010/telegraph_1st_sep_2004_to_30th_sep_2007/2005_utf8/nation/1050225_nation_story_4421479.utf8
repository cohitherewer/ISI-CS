 BJP to stall Parliament over Goa dismissal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Parrikar:Hard times

New Delhi, Feb. 24: As the Congress-led alliance shored up its strength in the 35-member Goa Assembly after a senior BJP legislator resigned his seat and brought down its number to 16, four days ahead of the confidence vote, the BJP?s central leaders decided they would stall proceedings in Parliament on March 1 over the ?undemocratic? dismissal of the Manohar Parrikar government.

 The meeting of the BJP leaders this evening, chaired by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was held to draw up a tentative strategy to corner the UPA in the budget session. 

 The strategy will be fine-tuned in another meeting of the NDA leaders tomorrow, which will also decide whether the NDA will boycott the rail budget presentation by railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav on February 26 as he was labelled as a ?tainted? minister by the alliance.

 S.S. Ahluwalia, the BJP?s chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, called the Goa government?s dismissal as a ?bypass surgery of the anti-defection law? and said it was a ?matter of public importance which we want to discuss in a democratic manner?. Realising the potency of the issue, sources said it would be raised after the presentation of the general budget.

 A Congress ministry headed by Pratapsinh Rane was installed on February 2 after governor S.C. Jamir dismissed the Manohar Parrikar-led BJP government. 

 Former Goa deputy chief minister Digambar Kamat quit the BJP today with plans to cross over to the Congress, causing a major setback to the BJP in its tussle to return to power in the state. With both the BJP and the Congress almost equally poised in the battle for numbers, every MLA counts. Rane will seek a vote of confidence on Monday.

 Parrikar made desperate attempts to get back Kamat to his side. He told reporters that he ?apprehended danger? to his party MLAs and also to his ?own life?.

 The BJP leaders at today?s meeting also took the view that the government must ?clarify and elucidate? its position on ?crucial? aspects of the latest peace package it offered to Pakistan. BJP sources objected to the ?manner? in which the government announced the start of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service ?without taking the Opposition and the country into confidence?.

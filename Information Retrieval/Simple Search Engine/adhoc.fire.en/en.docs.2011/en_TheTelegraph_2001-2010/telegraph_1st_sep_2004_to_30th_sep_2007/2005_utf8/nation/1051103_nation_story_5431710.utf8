 Taj snap ends row over victim

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: A photograph has ended the dispute over the body of seven-year-old Maitreyee Bhattacharyya, who died on Saturday in the Delhi bomb blasts.

 Maitreyee was cremated today. 

 I am relieved, said her maternal uncle Apurba Sarma, who escaped the blasts. I dont know how others could lay claim over the body when I had all the evidence and I myself had carried the body to the hospital. 

 The condition of Sarmas sister, Pranati Bhattacharyya, has deteriorated.

 Facing rival claims, Delhi police had earlier decided that a joint cremation would be the best option after taking the necessary samples for DNA tests. 

 The other claimant was Balbir Singh from Haryana who was arguing that Maitreyee was his relatives daughter.

 Delhi police changed their mind today after Sarma produced a snapshot of Maitreyee wearing a red top and checked skirt in front of Taj Mahal in Agra a few days ago. 

 The fact that she was wearing the same dress on Saturday made our task of identification easier, Sarma said.

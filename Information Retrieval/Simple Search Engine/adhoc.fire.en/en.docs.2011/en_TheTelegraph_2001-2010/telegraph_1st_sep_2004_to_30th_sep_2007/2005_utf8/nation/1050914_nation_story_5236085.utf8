 Permit hassle for Shahrukh show

 New Delhi (PTI): A proposed Shahrukh 

 Khan show has run into rough weather with Delhi police and 

 the fire service department not giving permission for the 

 September 17 event citing security and fire 

 safety as the reasons.

 Actors Rani Mukherjee and Amisha Patel were also to appear in the concert, which was to be organised by the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People in the open space in front of the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. 

 But the South District police said the request to hold the Shahrukh concert could be considered if the show was held inside the stadium and clearance obtained from the fire, electrical and traffic departments.

 The fire department has refused to give a no-objection certificate for the show inside the stadium, saying it did not have fire safety arrangements.

 Havildar in extortion net

 New Delhi (PTI): The CBI has arrested 

 an army havildar from Sikar, Rajasthan, for extorting money 

 from the family of a soldier, who went missing at the LoC.

 On a tip-off from the family of the soldier, Pradeep Chowdhary of the Jat Regimental Centre in Uttar Pradesh, the CBI arrested Satbir from Sikar bus depot on Sunday with Rs 20,000. Satbir had allegedly forced Chowdharys family to hand over the amount to him.

 Interrogation hints the possibility of involvement of senior officers in Bareilly, army sources said.

 Nafisa at helm

 New Delhi (PTI): Social activist and 

 actor Nafisa Ali has been appointed chairperson of the Childrens 

 Film Society of India, sources said.

 Ali succeeds actor Raveena Tandon who resigned from the post earlier this year citing personal reasons.

 Rebels arrested

 Jammu (PTI): Security forces have arrested 

 six Hizb-ul Mujahideen terrorists from Doda district. Five

 Cops missing

 Chandigarh (PTI): At least four Punjab 

 Police players who went to the US to take part in a river 

 rafting competition in August, have gone missing, prompting

 leave, one has returned, while two others sent leave applications 

 from New York. But there is no news about the rest four.

 Donkeys, beggars amp; bidding 

 - Auction of wards in Andhra civic poll

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 13: Ever heard of donkeys occupying centre stage in an election?

 Or, for that matter, beggars being wooed with gifts?

 Probably not. But then, anything goes when its election time. Especially when beggars have a thousand votes and can swing the fortunes of at least three municipal ward members in Karimnagar town on September 24, the day 96 municipalities and 11 municipal corporations in Andhra Pradesh vie for votes of 75 lakh urban voters.

 But first the donkeys.

 Its not that the beasts of burden have brayed their consent, but they have kicked up a lot of dust.

 All political parties are wooing urban voters in Kurnool, 225 km southwest of Hyderabad, with an offer to rid the town of donkeys. 

 S. Venkateswarlu, a candidate of the Telugu Desam, says there are 6,340 stray donkeys in the town and they block roads and cause a nuisance.

 So is it curtains for the beasts? 

 Local residents laughed off the idea. Kurnool town is known for its three Ds ? dirt, dust and donkeys ? and successive civic bodies have failed to eliminate any of the three so far, says U.R. Kalkura, a prominent hotelier and former district Congress chief.

 But the beggars are dead serious.

 Our beggars association has 1,000 votes, which will affect the chances of at least three ward members, says Gopanna, a beggar leader in Karimnagar town.

 They are surprised, too, at the sudden attention. Nobody bothered whether we voted or not in the general elections. But almost every party is wooing us with gifts and assurances for the September 24 polls, says Sambanna, the head of a beggar family in the town.

 Congress, Desam and Telengana Rashtra Samiti candidates have been visiting his hut at least once a day.

 Surprisingly, these beggars own portable television sets and radios and live in one-room tenements. If they live in own or rented houses and own property, they can no more be called beggars, says municipal official Prabhakar Rao.

 Samakka, a 42-year-old who has been begging since her parents died, bristles at the suggestion. We are called beggars because we beg for a living. It does not mean that we are not entitled to houses, clothes or even the right to marry and raise families. 

 Come September 24, Samakka will queue up with the others to exercise another right ? the right to vote.

 Voters will also line up outside booths in the coastal districts of Srikakulam, East Godavari and Krishna, but the battle may have already been decided. 

 Reports from these districts say votes are being auctioned in the name of development. According to these reports, candidates are offering money to local elders and the one who shells out the most is assured of the votes of the whole ward.

 I have bid for three wards in the town, says G. Krishna Rao, a Desam candidate of Gudivawada municipality in Krishna district. To emerge as chairman of the local municipality, I need a minimum of seven wards.

 In Amalapuram municipality, Congress candidate K.S. Naidu has bid for seven of the 22 wards. I am shelling out Rs 3 lakh to each of them for their local development, he says.

 State election commissioner A.V.S. Reddy has asked for reports on such bids, but those in the know say it is unlikely that the auctions will stop.

 Everyone knows what is happening. During the general elections, some village panchayats auctioned their votes to the highest bidder in East Godavari district, said Butchaiah Chowdhary, a former Desam minister.

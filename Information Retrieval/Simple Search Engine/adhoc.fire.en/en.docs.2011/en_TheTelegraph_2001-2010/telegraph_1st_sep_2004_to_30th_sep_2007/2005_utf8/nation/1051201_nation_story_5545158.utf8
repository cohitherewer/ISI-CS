 Persaud: Healing minds

 London, Nov. 30: Dr Raj Persaud, Britains most high-profile psychiatrist, left London today to visit last Decembers tsunami victims in India to see what else can be done to help them recover psychologically from the traumatic effects of the tragedy.

 Although you can see a broken arm, you cant see a broken mind ? and its easy, therefore, to miss it, Persaud told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview before his departure.

 Persaud, who is being accompanied by a colleague, Nial Sookoo of ActionAid, a British charity, will visit tsunami-hit areas like Nagapattinam and Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu and parts of Pondicherry. 

 In June this year, western sources estimated that more than 128,000 people died in the disaster, while at least 37,000 others remain missing. They say the exact number of victims will probably never be known. About 500,000 people were also left homeless. 

 In India, official sources put the number of dead at 10,776, while 5,640 are missing, including 5,554 on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 Persauds trip to India has been organised by the Disaster Emergency Committee, the umbrella organisation for UK charities, which spearheaded fund-raising after the tsunami struck on December 26 last year and more recently after the quake in Pakistan.

 I will be observing what the Indians are doing and seeing what other assistance can be rendered from other agencies though I suspect I will find that India is doing a pretty good job by itself, he observed.

 It seems India can do with many more psychiatrists, though. Persaud pointed out: There are only 4,000 psychiatrists in India according to The Lancet ? that compares with probably roughly double that number in the UK.

 Persaud, 42, who was born in Britain of Caribbean parents of Indian origin, was too modest to say he probably gets more attention from the British media than almost any other psychiatrist in the country. His mother named him Rajendra after Indias first President. 

 The key issue around my visit is to draw attention to the major psychological work going on in India to help survivors of the tsunami, said Persaud. This appears a relatively new departure for India to take psychological rehabilitation so seriously and to pour so many resources into it.

 He went on: The tendency before has been to focus on medical and practical problems like physical reconstruction. In fact, a major part of the suffering caused by major disasters like tsunamis involves the mental trauma which lingers for a very long time, indeed years, unless properly addressed.

 It is an area which needs more attention, he feels. Psychological trauma includes things like coping with bereavement and loneliness. However, there are other issues as well. Survivors of major traumatic events often blame themselves for not doing more to save relatives or friends when, in fact, they did all they could. 

 Specialist psychological techniques are needed to deconstruct their own interpretation of their actions during the catastrophe itself as otherwise you get stuck in the replaying of a kind of video loop over and over again in your mind over what you did and what you should have done instead ? this can lead to hopelessness and despair and the loss of the will to live.

 Persaud drew the attention of The Telegraph to a scientific paper headed The need for psychological interventions in emergencies.

 The paper said: Psychological reactions to disaster are essentially the reactions of normal human beings to sudden, unexpected and terrifying events in their lives. People lose loved ones and property. Above all, they lose faith in the fact that life has consistency and meaning.

 The paper also emphasised: Death imprint relates to indelible imagery of the encounter with death, intruding while awake or in the form of nightmares during sleep.

 The paper deals with the effect of tragedies on children. Having established that children are among the worst-hit in emergency situations, it is important to include schools in any long-term intervention. Teachers may thus form a very important safety net and support system for children.

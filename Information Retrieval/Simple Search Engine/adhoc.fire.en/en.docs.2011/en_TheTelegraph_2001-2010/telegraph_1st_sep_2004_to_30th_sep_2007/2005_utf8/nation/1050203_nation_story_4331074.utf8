 PM and rival one in pullout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had taken the main Opposition party, the BJP, into confidence before announcing his decision not to attend the Saarc summit. 

 Today, he met Atal Bihari Vajpayee and BJP chief L.K. Advani to discuss the situation in Nepal and Bangladesh.

 Sources said Advani instructed party workers not to give any reaction on the UPA government?s Saarc decision for the next three days.

 The decision on the Saarc summit seemed to find favour with some retired diplomats.

 Muchkund Dubey, a former foreign secretary who had served in Dhaka, and Deb Mukherjee, who headed the Indian missions in Bangladesh and Nepal, felt Delhi needed to give out a strong signal to the neighbours in view of the recent developments.

 ?The decision of the government is perfectly appropriate as it is designed to address the situation both in Nepal and Bangladesh,? Dubey said.

 He felt that King Gyanendra?s coup yesterday had killed whatever little chance Nepal had of pursuing the democratic route and the political killings in Dhaka ? especially that of Shamsul Kibira ? raised doubts whether Dhaka was in a position to give security to the visiting Saarc leaders. ?It was high time that India gave out a strong signal to both the neighbours about its dissatisfaction over the developments in their countries.?

 Mukherjee said it was natural for any government to be concerned about regional developments. ?While Saarc does not discuss bilateral issues and the stress is on strengthening regional cooperation and ensuring progress in South Asia, what is the framework within which these are to be discussed??

 He said concerns shown by India were legitimate as Dhaka?s failure to stop the political killings had raised serious doubts if it knew what was going on in the country.

 The summit ? slated to be held on February 6 and 7 ? had to be postponed as the Saarc charter makes it mandatory for all seven members to attend its annual conference. 

 This is the second time that the summit has been called off. Initially scheduled to be held in January, it was pushed back by a month following the tsunami disaster.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran said India has communicated its decision to Dhaka and the other Saarc members and sought fresh dates for the summit.

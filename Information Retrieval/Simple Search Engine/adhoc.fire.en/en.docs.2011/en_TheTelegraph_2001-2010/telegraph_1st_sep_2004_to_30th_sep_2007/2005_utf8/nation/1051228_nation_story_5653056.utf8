 New Delhi, Dec. 27: Reacting to the Sanjay Joshi sex scandal, National Commission for Women chairperson Girija Vyas has said her organisation cannot take action on the basis of an anonymous letter supposedly sent by a woman levelling sexual exploitation charges against the BJP leader.

 I have not received the letter but have heard about it through media reports, Vyas said. 

 The letter is signed peedit kanya (traumatised girl) and carries no postal address.

 Written in Hindi, it was sent to journalists and political bigwigs in the BJP. 

 I am a humiliated, exploited woman who is begging you for help, the anonymous author pleads. 

 A leader, well-known in politics, has destroyed me and sexually exploited me. This leader takes pride in his status of a celibate bachelor. This brahmachari neta (celibate leader) is a debauch. 

 He is educated and wallows in luxury. He has sexually abused me. I am sending with the letter evidence of his crime. The condom I am sending will give you proof of the crime committed. This is the condom he has used to sexually exploit me, the author adds.

 The name of this celibate brahmachari is Sanjay Joshi, general secretary, BJP, 11 Ashoka Road, New Delhi 1. He is a rapist masquerading as a brahmachari. He should be hanged. I would like you to do a DNA test of the condom. This will expose the crime, the letter says. 

 If I commit suicide I will not be able to send this evidence and punish the criminal. 

 I am a woman and still have the rest of my life before me. I am scared of being stigmatised. Please help me. Hang this pretentious brahmachari of the BJP and save other women from him, the author says.

 The supposed victim also reposes full faith in Vyas. I have absolute confidence in your courage and your sense of justice, the letter says.

 But Vyass hands are tied. We do take up such cases of exploitation. But how can we take action when the letter has no name or address. We would have investigated the matter even if the author had contacted us on the phone or a third party had approached us on her behalf, Vyas said. 

 It often happens that the person is scared to write. Then she can talk to us on the phone. But we must have something to proceed on.

 Cross-country graft raids chase officials

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, June 30: An army of bureaucrats woke up to a chain of raids across the country, including Calcutta, as the CBI today set in motion one of its biggest crackdowns on suspected corruption this year.

 Premises of as many as 106 officials spread over 183 locations were targeted in the raids. Based on alleged seizures during the searches, the agency registered 30 cases against the officials, accusing them of possessing unaccounted assets.

 Among those raided were several top officials, some enjoying the rank of joint secretary. Delhi topped the list with 41 searches while 16 were conducted in Mumbai. Calcutta and Jaipur accounted for 11.

 The investigating agency claimed to have recovered property worth Rs 10 crore and seized Rs 60 lakh in cash.

 Our attempt is to keep corrupt officials on the run and with such drives, we have been successful, CBI director U.S. Misra said.

 Among those against whom cases were registered are additional commissioner of income-tax, Calcutta, V. Appala Raju; a chief engineer of railways in Chennai, Vikram Srivastav; and the regional commissioner of the Employees Provident Fund, Prabhu Dayal Sankhla.

 The agency said Appala Raju was found to have assets valued at Rs 30.64 lakh more than his recorded income. The CBI sleuths raided six places in a bid to find evidence against him.

 Among the officials raided in Delhi was an assistant commissioner of police, Uday Veer Singh Raathi.

 The sleuths arrested Krishan Kumar, Ashwini Dhingra and Mohan Lal Khajuria for committing fraud on the income-tax department by claiming income tax rebate of Rs 1.74 crore on the basis of forged finance ministry documents.

 Calcutta catch

 In Calcutta, the CBIs anti-corruption branch arrested superintendents of central excise Malay Kumar Bhattacharya and Debasish Basu late last night when they were allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 25,000 from a businessman at his office. 

 Today, the sleuths raided Bhattacharyas Lake Town residence on the northern fringes of the city and seized Rs 3 lakh in cash along with some documents. The raid revealed that Bhattacharya owns a house and a plot in Madhyamgram, on the northern fringes of Calcutta, the agency said.

 The raid on Basus residence, however, did not throw up anything to suggest that his assets were disproportionate to his recorded income.

 The CBI also raided the residences of two officers from the National Insurance Company at Birati and Haridevpur on the northern and southern fringes of Calcutta, respectively, based on a complaint that the two were releasing fake bills without checking papers.

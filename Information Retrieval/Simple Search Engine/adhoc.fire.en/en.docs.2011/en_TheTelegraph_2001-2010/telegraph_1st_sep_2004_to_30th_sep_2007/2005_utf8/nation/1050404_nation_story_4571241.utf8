The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Foe to ?sincere friend?, ahead of Wen visit

 OUR BUREAU

 Wen: Enemy no more?

 Calcutta, April 3: China and India are ?sincere friends, not adversaries?, any longer, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao declared today, ahead of his trip to New Delhi next weekend.

 A wide-ranging interview by Wen to PTI indicated the Chinese leadership?s satisfaction with steps taken by the UPA government to develop relations with Beijing since it came to power last year. 

 That satisfaction was, however, expressed in typically inscrutable Chinese style with Wen speaking in riddles and only hinting at what to expect during his visit that promises to produce a major push in Sino-Indian relations.

 ?China and India have reached important consensus?, Wen said in his interview when asked about the boundary dispute between the countries. 

 He proceeded to explain: ?That is, both sides should view and handle the relations from a strategic high ground bearing in mind the larger picture, and refuse to let questions left over from history disrupt and impede the development of bilateral relations.?

 In plain language, what he meant to say was that India and China have agreed on a dozen or so points that will serve as ?parameters and guiding principles? in resolving their border dispute.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran rushed to Beijing last week to secure final agreement on these ?parameters and guiding principles?. 

 These were agreed upon in broad terms in a breakthrough during the fourth meeting of special representatives of the two countries on the border question. 

 The late J.N. Dixit had represented India as national security adviser at that meeting. Representing China was vice-foreign minister Dai Bingguo.

 Dixit?s death created uncertainties about the future of what he had broadly agreed with the Chinese special representative at that time.

 But in recent weeks, the Manmohan Singh government took several steps to assure China that it was committed to progress in resolving the border dispute on the lines of what was agreed between the two governments during former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s trip to Beijing in June 2003.

 The steps included acceding to an explicit Chinese request in the wake of Dixit?s death that special representatives dealing with the border question should be political appointees and not civil servants.

 India nominated national security adviser M.K. Narayanan as its special representative a few weeks ago. 

 It subsequently appointed Vijay Nambiar last week as deputy national security adviser. Nambiar, a veteran Sinologist with contacts across the Chinese establishment, will assist Narayanan in this effort.

 ?I believe that as long as the two sides act in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, respect history while taking the reality into account, they will be able to find a mutually acceptable solution to the boundary questions through negotiations on an equal footing,? Wen said in his interview.

 The foreign secretary used his visit to Beijing last week to convene a meeting of the India-China Joint Working Group (JWG) on the boundary question. The last meeting of the JWG was held as long ago as November 2002.

 Although the JWG was set up following Rajiv Gandhi?s prime ministerial visit to China in 1988, its 15 meetings failed to go beyond technical aspects of the border dispute.

 The decision to appoint special representatives was a sequel to this lack of progress. Saran also held a meeting of the expert group on the border issue during his visit.

 The meetings reviewed the ongoing process of demarcating the Line of Actual Control, confidence building measures and steps for maintenance of peace on the Sino-Indian border as a prelude to the agreement expected during Wen?s visit to New Delhi.

 Wen was asked if China would support India?s case for permanent membership of the UN Security Council, an issue that is expected to come to head in the General Assembly in September. 

 He was at his inscrutable best once again. ?China supports reasonable and necessary reforms to the Security Council so that it will get a bigger representation, especially that of the developing countries. 

 ?India is a major developing country th at plays a positive role in regional and international affairs. I fully understand India?s position, as I am ready to see a greater role of India in international arena, the UN included.?

 Privately, Chinese leaders have told their Indian counterparts that they favour India?s entry into the Security Council. But they are not averse to blocking Security Council reform as a whole. This is because they do not want Japan to a member of the council both for historical reasons and because Tokyo can be America?s cat?s paw in the world body.

 Hence the ambiguity about India too in public.

 Wen said cooperation between India and China ?far outweighs our competition, our common understanding our differences. We have every reason to be friendly and co-operative and no reason whatsoever to go for conflict or confrontation?.

 He said relations between the two countries have entered a ?new period of comprehensive cooperation... We both regard each other as important partner of exchange and cooperation enjoying growing political trust?.

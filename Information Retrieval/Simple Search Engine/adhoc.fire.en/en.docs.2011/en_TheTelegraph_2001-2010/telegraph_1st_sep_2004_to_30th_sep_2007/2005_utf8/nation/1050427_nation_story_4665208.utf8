 Expert posers on elephant survival

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 26: Wildlife activists in Orissa have pointed at a bleak future for elephants in the state even as the wildlife department sounded optimistic over the results of the census survey.

 The department has claimed that the dung-heap method, in addition to the traditional enumeration process, would make the counting error-free.

 But, as the three-day census survey came to an end yesterday, wildlife activists warned that the survival of elephants was under threat owing to deforestation and diversion of forestland, mainly for mining and other development projects. 

 ?The future of elephants is not all that rosy in Orissa. The severe loss of adult tuskers/bulls due to poaching in the past decade can lead to a skewed male-female ratio in the coming years,? said Kulamani Deo of Wild Orissa, an NGO. 

 The organisation participated in the census survey at the Mayurbhanj, Mahanadi and Sambalpur elephant reserves, besides the proposed ones, Baitarani and South Orissa.

 ?Vedanta Alumina?s proposed refinery in Kalahandi, the Brutanga irrigation project in Nayagarh and the upcoming iron and steel projects in Jajpur, Keonjhar and Sundargarh will adversely affect the elephant population in Orissa,? Deo warned.

 Years ago, the state?s forests were home to thousands of elephants. According to official figures, Orissa had 2,044 wild elephants in 1979. But, in the last census in 2002, the number had come down to 1,841. 

 Deforestation due to shifting cultivation, encroachment, forest fires, agricultural activities, mining and industries have significantly contributed to the problems faced by the elephants.

 Besides, about 200 elephants fell to poachers between 1990-91 and 2004-05, while another 100 had been killed in accidents during the same period. 

 Human-elephant conflicts have become common as the animals stray into thickly-populated localities in search of food. Deforestation and the loss of traditional sources of food are the main reasons behind this, feel wildlife activists.

 Between 1995-96 and 2003-04, 259 people were killed by wild elephants. The mining areas in Keonjhar, Dhenkanal, Sundargarh, Angul and Sambalpur districts were the worst-affected areas as far as human-elephant conflicts were concerned.

 The wildlife activists allege that the government has done little to restore corridors and evict encroachers from elephant habitats. ?At the most, the government is half-serious,? said Biswajit Mohanty, secretary of the Wildlife Society of Orissa.

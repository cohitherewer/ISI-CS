 NRI guilty of employee torture

 London, Oct. 19 (PTI): A city court has convicted a non-resident Indian of torturing her female employee to the point of disability and holding her without consent.

 A jury at the Harrow crown court unanimously decided to convict 55-year-old Taru Patel of North London on one count of grievous bodily harm and one count of false imprisonment. Jurors rejected Patels claim that the woman had been gang-raped.

 The court heard how Patel had attacked the woman almost every day with heavy wooden ladles and other kitchen implements, leaving her victim with shattered and gangrenous fingers, suppurating sores and rotting flesh. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also had her hair pulled out and suffered cigarette burns on her feet and legs. Some wounds damaged the underlying muscle.

 She faces a lifetimes disability because of muscle wastage that has left her unable to walk properly or lift her arms above her head.

 The 42-year-old victim told the court that she had left India for the UK to secure a better future for her family. For nearly a year, the mother of two failed to find work, until Patel offered her a ?3-an-hour live-in job at the pickle factory she ran from her home. Patel also persuaded the woman to hand over a large sum of money, claiming she needed it to process her nationality application.

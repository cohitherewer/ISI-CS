 New Delhi, June 22: The post-mortem conducted on the body of the Israeli woman found dead under mysterious circumstances in the farmhouse of Delhi builder Sudarshan Kohli has established that she died after a fall.

 The 25-year-old woman, identified as Adi Chakad, was found dead by Kohlis son Ankush on the front porch yesterday afternoon.

 According to police, it is likely that she fell from the first-floor balcony of the Westend Greens farmhouse near Vasant Kunj.

 The post-mortem report said her death was caused due to a fall from a height. Her kidney and spleen had ruptured and she had suffered fractures in her jaw.

 The report suggests that she died due to a fall from a height. There were multiple fractures in the body and internal injuries, a senior police official said.

 The Kohli farmhouse is guarded by two private security agencies and is surrounded by 20-foot-high walls. 

 It also has closed-circuit cameras placed at the entrance to keep a watch on visitors.

 Delhi police are also looking into the huge stash of blue films and CDs recovered from the farmhouse.

 According to police sources, Adi Chakad was introduced by Ankush, also 25, as a girlfriend. He reportedly met her about 10 days ago during a visit to Almora in Uttaranchal.

 The Israeli had come to India on a three-month tourist visa and had moved into Ankushs home about a week back when her visa expired.

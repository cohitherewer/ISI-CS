 Punjabis liars? Let slur rest in peace

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 11: Punjabis are liars, Lahore High Court of the British-ruled undivided India had observed during a trial in a criminal case in 1925. Eighty years later, the statement has been raked up, but the Supreme Court has refused to remove the remark from the judgment, saying it was made under peculiar circumstances.

 Spotting some inconsistencies in a dying declaration, British judges Scott and Smith had said: It is well known that the inhabitants of Punjab will often in dying declarations not only accuse the actual offenders but will also add the names of other enemies.

 Delhi-based advocate Sonia Raj Sood had moved the Supreme Court seeking to expunge the uncharitable comment on the community from law books.

 However, a division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and G.P. Mathur turned down her public interest litigation, saying there was no need to rake up an issue buried under law books for 80 years.

 The judges added that the remark, made at a particular point of time in history and under peculiar circumstances, was general in nature and did not cast aspersions on any particular community.

 Another loophole in the petition was that a PIL can be accepted in civil cases and not in a criminal case.

 Sood had earlier approached President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam with a representation that carried signatures of over 500 prominent Punjabis, including columnist and former nominated member of the Rajya Sabha Kuldip Nayar, Col (retd) R.S. Sodhi and Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee member Harinder Pal Singh.

 The representation asked for the matter to be taken up diplomatically with the British government seeking a formal apology as the remark was a grave insult to the Punjabi community.

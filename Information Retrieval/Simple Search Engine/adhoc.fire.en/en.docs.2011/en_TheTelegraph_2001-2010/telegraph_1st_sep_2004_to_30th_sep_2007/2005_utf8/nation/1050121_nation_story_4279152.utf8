 CPM drafts dilemma

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: The CPM?s draft political resolution that will guide the party in the next three years walks a tightrope between opposing and supporting the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government.

 The resolution will be adopted at the 18th party congress in April. The draft will now be discussed by the party cadre at every level and amendments will be moved before it becomes a final document.

 ?The stability of the UPA government depends not on us but also on its capacity to honour the common minimum programme,? said CPM politburo member Prakash Karat.

 The draft indicates the CPM?s dilemma ? of not being able to use the ultimate political weapon of pulling the rug from under the Congress-led government despite its unhappiness with the Centre?s performance in several crucial sectors. 

 The bottomline is clear: The Congress-led coalition, according to Karat, has to survive a full five-year term if only to keep the National Democratic Alliance out of power.

 It has taken the CPM a long time to change its doctrine from treating the BJP and the Congress as twin dangers to identifying the BJP as the main enemy. However, the party?s intrinsic differences with the Congress continue.

 The CPM?s disaffection with the Congress-led dispensation touches almost every important area of governance, from economics to health and education. The draft political resolution states: ?Liberalisation under BJP rule meant a bonanza for the rich and growing deprivation and unemployment for the common people. The UPA government is pursuing the same policies.?

 The Centre wants to liberalise the financial sector, privatise insurance and civil aviation sectors and raise the FDI cap in telecom. ?It wants to circumvent its commitment not to privatise profitable PSUs by gradually disinvesting shares in these units,? says the political resolution.

 The party faults the Centre for failing to do enough in the social sector. ?The UPA government announced a 2 per cent education cess, but it did not take any steps to increase education expenditure in the 2004-05 Union budget,? says the resolution.

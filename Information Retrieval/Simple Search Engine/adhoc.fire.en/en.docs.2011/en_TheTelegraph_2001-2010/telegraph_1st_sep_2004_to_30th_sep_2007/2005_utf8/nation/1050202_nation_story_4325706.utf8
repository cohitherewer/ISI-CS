 PC hears out Left, makes no promises

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram today heard out Left leaders on what they want incorporated in the forthcoming budget but gave no assurances.

 Leaders of four Left parties had a two-hour pre-budget discussion with Chidambaram this afternoon. They gave him a three-page note listing 10 priorities. 

 The Left, among other things, wants the finance minister to substantially hike social sector allocations, not to divest profit-making public sector undertakings and to tax the rich and the corporate sector. The Left wants the government to provide an additional Rs 50,000 crore to meet the commitments in the common minimum programme.

 Chidambaram told the Left leaders that every ministry and department had its list of demands and he would have to find the means of mobilising resources to satisfy each one of them. Assuring them that he intended to go by the common minimum programme, the minister said the commitments could not be met in one leap but over a period of time.

 The contentious issue of divestment of profit-making public sector units came up during the discussion. ?We told the finance minister we are opposed to divestment of profit-making public sector undertakings,? said CPM politburo member Prakash Karat.

 Chidambaram reportedly said the Centre has no intention of carrying out wholesale divestment of PSUs. Sources said he tried to convince the Left that ownership of PSUs will remain with the government even after divestment. 

 But the Left is unmoved. Its note to Chidambaram said: ?Selling off stakes in profit-making public sector undertakings is in effect equivalent to running a budget deficit.?

 It reiterated its opposition to the government?s move to set up a national investment fund from the sale proceeds. ?Public spending on the social sector should be financed by raising resources through direct taxation or having a budget deficit,? the Left suggested.

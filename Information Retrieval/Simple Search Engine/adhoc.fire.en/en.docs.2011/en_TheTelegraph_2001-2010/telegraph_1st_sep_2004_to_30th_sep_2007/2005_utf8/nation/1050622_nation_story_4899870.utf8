 Lunch diplomacy for Naga talks

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, June 21: Where normal negotiations have not led to any significant progress in the peace talks with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), could lunch diplomacy help? 

 Oscar Fernandes, the leader of the ministerial team negotiating with the Nagas, certainly hoped that it would. And his expectations were not belied.

 Fernandes hosted two informal lunches over three days for Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the NSCN (I-M) ? on Saturday and again on Monday. And for good measure, he had a one-hour meeting with the Prime Minister in between on Sunday about how to take the Naga peace talks in a more purposeful direction.

 He met Manmohan Singh along with K. Padmanabhaiah, who has been the governments point person in dealing with the NSCN (I-M) over the last few years. 

 In briefing the Prime Minister, the two negotiators are believed to have told him that the Naga issue should be solved with the right people at the right time and argued that this was an opportune moment to do so.

 The Prime Minister is believed to have agreed with them on the urgency and necessity of resolving the Naga conflict. He apparently told Fernandes that the government was determined to solve the Naga issue through peaceful means. He directed him and his team of ministers to settle the Naga issue, warning that otherwise none of the insurgencies in the Northeast could be addressed through peaceful means. This was conveyed by Fernandes to Muivah when he invited him for lunch again a day later.

 The luncheon meetings and the high-level consultations that went on in the background had the desired impact. The Indian government is clearly more serious about a settlement now, Muivah is believed to have told his colleagues. 

 There is also to be a formal meeting between the Naga and the government negotiators tomorrow.

 Fernandes did not want the NSCN (I-M) leaders to leave India thinking that Delhi was neither sincere nor prepared to settle the Naga issue peacefully. A series of informal meetings were, therefore, proposed to Muivah. National security adviser M.K. Narayanan had an informal meeting with Muivah, followed by Fernandes hosting the Naga leader at his residence.

 The Naga leadership seemed to be taken in by the sensitivity and understanding shown by Fernandes to their point of view. After the Prime Ministers message was conveyed to Muivah, he not only accepted that the government was serious about a settlement but also added that a definite time-frame should be set to settle the issue.

 The governments attempt seems to be to let the Naga leaders go abroad, but with the assurance that New Delhi would be ready to continue the peace talks as soon as they are prepared to come back. 

 Such an assurance is perhaps aimed at ameliorating any residual bitterness that the NSCN (I-M) leaders might have ? although the talks have been held in an amazingly warm, cordial and understanding atmosphere. 

 The attempt is also to ensure that the ceasefire-extension talks are held in a positive context. The eight-year-old ceasefire agreement comes to an end on July 31.

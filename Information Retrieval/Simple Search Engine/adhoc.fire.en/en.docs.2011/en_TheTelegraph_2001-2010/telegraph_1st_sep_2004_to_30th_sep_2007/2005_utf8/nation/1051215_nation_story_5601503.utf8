 Atal steps into yatra politics

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: Atal Bihari Vajpayees presence today at a Varanasi public meeting which flagged off the BJPs nyaya yatra (justice roadshow) was perceived as politically significant in party circles for more reasons than one.

 It was the former Prime Ministers first foray into agitational politics in several years. Vajpayee campaigned for elections and addressed public rallies, but yatras were not his style, BJP sources said.

 That was left to L.K. Advani, they added.

 Old-timers recalled that the RSS had wanted Vajpayee to launch one leg of the Ram rath yatra, but he politely declined and left the country with a parliamentary delegation when Advani hit the streets on his chariot.

 Given Vajpayees supposed state of indifferent health, it was all the more interesting that he had opted to travel on eastern Uttar Pradeshs rough terrain, the sources said.

 Second, the nyaya yatra was led by BJP general secretary and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Rajnath Singh. He is considered a serious contender in the race to take over the BJP after Advani quits this year-end or in early 2006.

 Sources said while the graphs of the other contenders ? notably M. Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Pramod Mahajan ? swung in varying degrees, Singh was a constant. Vajpayees presence was seen as a hand of blessing on him.

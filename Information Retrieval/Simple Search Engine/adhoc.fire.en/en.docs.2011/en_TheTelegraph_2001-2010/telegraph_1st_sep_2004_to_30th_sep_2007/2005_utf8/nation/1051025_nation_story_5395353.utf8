The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Paper tax

 Calcutta, Oct. 24: The Indian Newspaper Society (INS) has urged the finance ministry to drop a proposal to levy service tax on the sale of advertising space in newspapers. 

 Terming the proposal alarming and retrograde, INS president Jacob Mathew said if the government imposed the 10.2 per cent tax on the value of advertising space, it would stunt the growth of the newspaper industry.

 The new proposal, having no legislative sanction, can adversely affect advertising revenues as well as the reach of the newspapers and burden the readers, he said.

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: After days of posturing and backroom negotiations, India and Pakistan have agreed to open the Line of Control to allow people from the two quake-ravaged Kashmirs to work together for relief and reconstruction.

 Nauseri in Teethwal, Chakoti and Hajipur in Uri, Rawalkot in Poonch and Tattapani in Mendhar ? the five points that have been agreed upon ? will be opened on November 7.

 The agreement was reached at a meeting in Islamabad, where the Indian delegation led by joint secretary in the foreign ministry Dilip Sinha and Syed Ibne Abbas, the director-general (South Asia) in the Pakistani foreign ministry, discussed issues relating to rehabilitation.

 It was agreed that because of non-availability of or damage to infrastructure on these points, crossings across the LoC would be permitted on foot, a joint statement issued at the end of the meeting said.

 The parameters and procedures, as already agreed upon between the two sides, being used for the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus service would be used for the above additional crossings and both will endeavour to expedite the clearance process preferably within 10 days, it said.

 The two sides also agreed that people can send things across the border for relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction purposes but only through local authorities, who should be informed in advance, at the designated five points. Priority would be given to members of divided families.

 Soon after the October 8 quake, Delhi had told Islamabad it could use its territory to reach inaccessible areas in Pakistan Kashmir. Initially, Islamabad seemed keen to accept the offer but within hours, changed its mind. It then made a formal request to India to allow its helicopters to fly close to the LoC.

 A few days later, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf suggested that the barriers across the border be lowered to allow Kashmiris from both sides to come to each others help.

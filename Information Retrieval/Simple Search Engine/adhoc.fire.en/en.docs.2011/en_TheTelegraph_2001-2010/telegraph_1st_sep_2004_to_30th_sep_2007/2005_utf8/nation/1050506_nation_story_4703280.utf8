 Villagers take on Maoists

 BOBBY MOHANTY

 Rourkela, May 5: A village near the Jharkhand border has decided to stand up to Maoist ?high-handedness?.

 According to sources, residents of Redha village, which is about 3 km from the Jharkhand border, have decided to thwart the attempts of the rebels to exact levy money from an agency involved in a primary school project.

 The Maoists recently threatened the contractor to give them 25 per cent of the total cost or face the consequences. The agency is involved in the construction of the school building.

 A part of the building will be used as a base for Central Reserve Police Force and state police personnel for their anti-Naxalite operations. Realising the threat the project poses to them, the Maoists have decided to target it, alleged a source.

 Following the threat, the contractor brought the matter to the notice of the village committee, which held a meeting on the villagers course of action. Refusing to bow before the Maoists, the villagers decided that work on the project will continue and the contractor will not give in to the demand for levy money.

 The villagers then reportedly informed the Maoists of their decision to support the school project. In response, the Naxalites warned them that they would blow up the building if it was used to station security forces. The villagers, too, would have to pay a heavy price, the rebels threatened.

 Last year, residents of villages on the Jharkhand border had formed squads to protect forests from the timber mafia.

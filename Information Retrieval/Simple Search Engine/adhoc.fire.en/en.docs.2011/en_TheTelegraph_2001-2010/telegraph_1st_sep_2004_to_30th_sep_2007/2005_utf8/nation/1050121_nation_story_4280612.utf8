 Snooze rules tell old from new

 - Sleep 

 divide in companies 

 Miss Thailand takes a break from rehearsals in preparation for the Miss Universe 2004 finals. 

 The Supreme Court may not think snoozing on the job is a great idea, but Corporate India is slowly waking up to its benefits.

 Though research after research claims that the power nap ? a siesta in between stretches of work ? is likely to make the employee smarter, it is unlikely to become company policy, at least in India. Like Bharat Forge, the Pune company that sacked its employee Uttam Manohar Nakate for dozing off, a decision that yesterday the apex court said was justified, no company would like its workers to snore on their jobs. But they are slowly acknowledging that there is a time in each employee?s life ? sometimes daily ? when the mind curdles and he needs to walk off from his seat and probably just curse to himself. Some companies even allow him to sleep.

 It is by how they look at sleep, and when they allow employees to catch it, that companies can be divided into two: the old and the new. Those who say no, though they stress de-stressing, are the ?regular? industry. Those who say yes are the new-age guys: IT and BPO sectors mostly.

 While older companies like Hindustan Lever Ltd have installed serious ?recreational? facilities like the gym, a BPO outfit like Intelenet Global Services Ltd has four resting rooms in each of the five floors of its Mumbai office building in Malad.

 ?The employees have to book a bed when they feel very tired, five to 10 minutes before they plan to take rest, because the resting rooms are often full,? says the spokesperson of Intelenet, a BPO organisation owned by HDFC and Barclays Bank PLC. Each room has three beds, each bed is fitted with a bedsheet, a pillow and a blanket. While the rest of the building is done up in bright colours, the sleeping rooms are done up gently, with dim lights that can be switched off.

 If such a favourable attitude towards sleep at Intelenet is built into the nature of the jobs it provides ? with shifts at all hours ? the foremost IT giants are also doing it.

 ?We do not encourage sleeping as a company policy,? says the Wipro spokesperson, but adds, ?there are no serious complaints of any employee falling asleep on his job either?. ?On the Bangalore campus, there is a coffee shop, a book store, a library and even a clothes store,? he says, which an employee can visit during the work-day. He says a place strictly to doze off is not necessary because Wipro employees are of an average age of 28-29, and more important, ?employees go to sleep when they have no work?.

 At Infosys there are dormitories where employees can retire to refresh their minds.

 On the other side of the spectrum are the regular offices that offer the recreation room-gym-cafeteria formula, but employees are sighted at these places usually before or after work ? and there are no sleeping facilities. 

 Lever at its Mumbai headquarters has a snazzy recreation room called the e-zone and a well set-up gym. ICICI has a gym, a canteen and a cafeteria. The gym is repeated at Essar. At the Lever e-zone ? it has the reckless motto: ?I don?t care whose call it is or who?s looking for me? ? employees can watch television or listen to music. 

 It was another thing that the only employee who dropped in around 5 pm was a young man looking for Mumbai Marathon pictures of his colleagues. ?They have so much work, they don?t get the time to come here during work hours,? said the spokesperson.

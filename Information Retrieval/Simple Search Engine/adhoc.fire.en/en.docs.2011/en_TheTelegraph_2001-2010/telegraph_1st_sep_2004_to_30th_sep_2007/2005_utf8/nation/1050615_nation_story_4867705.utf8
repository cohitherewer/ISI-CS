 No whistle, but ready for best shot: Pervez

 MUKHTAR AHMAD AND AGENCIES

 Musharraf

 Srinagar/Canberra, June 14: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today said there was nobody who could exercise control on everyone and everything that is happening in Kashmir, but promised to give his best shot to bring peace and harmony in relations with India.

 I certainly dont hold a whistle which I can blow and every bullet stops being fired, he said, commenting on yesterdays deadly blast in Kashmir that claimed over a dozen lives.

 Musharraf, the first Pakistani President to visit Australia, said he felt total peace and harmony cannot be expected in Kashmir even if the two countries resolved their dispute and both sides understand that.

 We should still expect some extremists who would not be agreeing and who would carry on (with attacks), he said in an interview.

 The Pakistani leader added that both the neighbours should be bold enough to stand up to acts of terrorism and promised to give his best shot in resolving differences with India. 

 Hundreds of miles away, Srinagar wore a deserted look. Government offices, educational institutions and banks remained closed and public vehicles stayed off the roads in response to a general strike called to protest yesterdays attack in Pulwama, a town in south Kashmir.

 The hardline faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference had called for the shutdown today. So did Syed Salahuddin, the Muzaffarabad-based chief of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen.

 The blast, the deadliest since militancy erupted in the state 16 years ago, spread panic through the length and breadth of the Valley. Pieces of human flesh, the smell of charred bodies and the unbearable sight of headless corpses marked the explosion. Even the bravest couldnt stand the sight, said government employee Bilal Ahmed.

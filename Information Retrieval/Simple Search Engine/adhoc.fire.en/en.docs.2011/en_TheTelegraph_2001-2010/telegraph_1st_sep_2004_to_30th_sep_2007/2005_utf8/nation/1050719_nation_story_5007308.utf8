 Calcutta stench in Prasad dope

 - Which city? Guessing game on

 Bidappa: Walking free

 Bangalore, July 18: Fashion guru Prasad Bidappa today acknowledged that support from high-profile friends helped him walk to freedom from the detention centre in Dubai.

 Bidappa, who spent 33 days in Al Rishidiya detention centre for carrying about two grams of marijuana, termed his quick release a miracle. 

 Asked how the marijuana came to be in his bag, Prasad said the packet could have been planted in Calcutta. He was in the city between June 2 and June 5. 

 While speaking to reporters here, Prasad said a guest came with the packet during a party in Calcutta. After the party, his friends who helped him pack put the packet in his bag, but he didnt think it would make such a big difference.

 Later, while speaking to The Telegraph, Prasad clarified that he had attended two parties, in Calcutta ? one at a fashion show in a hotel and another hosted by a television channel. 

 But its not possible for me to pinpoint at which party the marijuana packet landed in my bag?. 

 Actually, when I told reporters that the packet of marijuana had been put into my bag by an invitee at a party in Calcutta I was just guessing. I am not sure at all where the packet came from. It has to be either Delhi or Calcutta because those are the two places I visited before the Dubai trip, Prasad said.

 The Calcutta hotel said its officials had spoken to the fashion guru in Bangalore and he had clarified the incident did not take place during his stay there. A senior official of the channel said that such a thing happening at its party was out of question.

 In Bangalore, Prasad dropped the names of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, liquor baron Vijay Mallya, S.M. Krishna, the Maharashtra governor, P.G.R. Sindhia, the Karnataka industries minister, and Maneka Gandhi as those who helped him out. 

 Known fashion world names like Rohit Bal, Rajesh Pratap Singh, Abraham and Thakore also vouched for his credentials. All of them sent letters to the local administration along with a plea for clemency. 

 Its a miracle I was freed so soon.This is my second birth. The judge went through my wifes (Judith) mercy petition and these letters and was convinced that I was not a smuggler?. Prasad, who has launched many successful models like Lara Dutta and Nafisa Joseph, told the reporters.

 He, however, admitted having tried marijuana in the eighties but said he was no addict. I am a Scotch (whisky) and water man. 

 He said: I will swear on my children that nobody in this business in the south uses cocaine. My wife has been misquoted that I try marijuana once or twice a week. 

 Prasad said he was set free without any conditions and would return to Dubai next month. 

 The fashion promoter said that his advocate Al Shamsi advised him to plead guilty as a user because severe punishment was given to peddlers with terms up to 15 years. 

 He asked me to tell the public prosecutor and the judge that I am a user but my blood tests proved negative.

 September date for Babur

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Aug. 12: Pakistan will begin serial production of its first locally-developed ground-launched cruise missile Babur from September, a media report said today.

 The nuclear-capable Babur or Hatf VII, which was test-fired for the first time yesterday from the newly-developed missile testing range in southwestern Baluchistan province, can hit a target 500 km away with pinpoint accuracy.

 The missiles will be handed over to the armed forces with the commencement of their serial production, Samar Mubarakmand, the chairman of the National Engineering and Scientific Commission of Pakistan, told The News.

 Pakistani scientists have already handed over different types of short- and medium-range missiles, including the Hatf III (Ghaznavi), Hatf IV (Shaheen-1) and Hatf V (Ghauri), to the Pakistan Armys Strategic Force Command.

 The country began test-firing versions of short- and medium-range missile in 1998 with the nuclear-capable Ghauri missile, which can hit targets up to 1,500 km. Mubarakmand, who heads the missile development programme, said Babur landed on its target in the southwestern Baluchistan province with an accuracy of centimetres.

 Pakistan joined a select group of countries which have the capability to design and develop cruise, by conducting Baburs test, said an official statement issued yesterday after the test.

 Pakistani officials and scientists were upbeat over their latest achievement, but the Japanese government regretted the test-fire. The government of Japan regrets the test-fire, said a statement issued by the Japanese embassy in Islamabad today, adding Tokyo hoped that Pakistan will sincerely respond to the efforts of the international community aimed at promoting disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.

 The statement comes a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz concluded his official four-day visit to the country, which restored its Official development Assistance package of approximately $500 million dollars for Islamabad in March. The package had been suspended after Pakistans nuclear tests in May 1998.

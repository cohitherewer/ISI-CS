 No shield for guilty, says Sonia

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: Sonia Gandhi displayed rare candour as she dwelt on the Volcker report today, making it clear that if the allegations turn out to be true, nobody, not even Natwar Singh, would be spared.

 Disclosing she had been extremely angry when she learnt the partys name had been used to receive payoffs in the Iraqi oil-for-food scam, she said the impression that Natwar was being shielded because of his proximity to the Gandhi family was wrong.

 It is not accurate at all. Certainly Natwar Singh had a close working relationship with us. But from the very beginning, I kept repeating that if what has come out in the document was authentic and if any individual had indulged in those activities, I was certainly not protecting them. Certainly I will not be on their side.

 In an hour-long interactive session with the media and delegates from industry and academia this morning, she spoke on a range of issues starting from the UPAs internal dynamics to the Lefts strident criticism of government policies.

 She interspersed her more serious observations with relaxed banter and occasional digs at the participants, particularly the media.

 I know good news does not always make news. But sometimes, only once in a while, the media can make an exception for us, she said while discussing the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the participation of civil society in governance.

 On how committed the UPA was to economic reforms given the Lefts objections to several policy decisions, she laced her reply with just enough sarcasm to keep the discussion lively.

 The UPA is a coalition of 14 parties. Of course, we have differences of opinion just like the government before us. But sometimes, our differences are exaggerated by the media.

 Our differences with the Left, for instance, are not as bitter as they are sometimes portrayed. I understand that the media are in the business of news. And we, being the provider of business, have to bear the brunt, she said, drawing quick laughter.

 On her first reaction when the oil-for-food scam broke, she said: I was extremely angry. Wouldnt you be? I have calmed down now, but I was extremely angry at the time. I want the government to get to the bottom of it in the shortest time possible.

 We have to know whether somebody has misused the name of the party. If the inquiry proves that individuals are innocent, well, it is good. But if people are involved, obviously they will be punished. Action will be taken. There are no two ways about it.

 She said her first priority had been to get the allegations verified. Not only is it my duty as Congress president to clear the name of the party but it is also a matter of public faith.

 Political parties do not enjoy the peoples faith as much as they should and it is a matter of grave concern. All of us have to work hard to restore that faith. People should not think that all of us are tarred with the same brush.

 Sonia said it was not true that Natwar was being made a scapegoat. Natwar Singh chose to resign and so far as the Congress is concerned, I am sure that the Justice R.S. Pathak committee will probe the matter and reveal the truth about who has misused the name of the party, she said.

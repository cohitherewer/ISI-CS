 PM shuffle in berth throes 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 15: Leading central allies of the Congress have put a spoke in Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs plans for a party-centric revamp of his ministry ahead of the start of Parliaments monsoon session on July 25.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal, Nationalist Congress Party and the DMK have demanded their share of berths in the expansion, which Singh wanted to limit to the Congress.

 The shuffle, which Singh and his party chief Sonia Gandhi have been discussing for two months, has been deferred till late August.

 The allies are believed to be arguing that the Congress, the leading partner in the UPA, should maintain coalition balance in the ministry.

 NCP chief spokesman D.P. Tripathi said the expansion cannot be merely a Congress-centric one. It has to be coalition-centric, he added.

 The delay has come as a blow to Congress aspirants who were expecting the revamp before Singhs departure for the US tomorrow. Their hopes had been fuelled by his remark last Saturday that the shuffle could take place any time.

 While forming his 68-member ministry last year, Singh had distributed the slots in an approximately 5:3 ratio. For every five Congress members, three were chosen from among the allies.

 With the size of the ministry limited to 82 following a Constitution amendment, Singh can induct a maximum of 14 ministers in addition to filling three vacancies. Going by the 5:3 ratio, the allies can claim at least five of the slots.

 The Congress can claim two of the three vacancies. One was created by the death of Sunil Dutt and the other by the exit of K. Rehman Khan, who was elected Rajya Sabha deputy chairman. 

 The third slot is that of the JMM as Shibu Soren had resigned in March to become Jharkhand chief minister for a few days.

 Sources in the allied ranks said they would have no objection if the expansion is limited to the three vacancies, but disagreed that their demand for additional berths was the only reason for the delay. 

 Various interest groups within the Congress are making it difficult for the Congress chief and the Prime Minister to arrive at an agreement..., said a source.

 But the Congress aspirants are blaming the allies. The delay is because of demands by the RJD and the NCP for berths, said a leader.

 Another jab at Modi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, April 3: The awkwardness was tangible as BJP president L.K. Advani declared known Modi-baiter Haren Pandya a martyr in the league of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee and Deendayal Upadhyaya at a ceremony held to unveil the former Gujarat home minister?s statue.

 ?Narendra Modi hai hai! Narendra Modi murdabad,? shouted the slain home minister?s father Vitthalbhai and other members of his family as they walked out to protest against the presence of the Gujarat chief minister. Vitthalbhai believes that his son was a victim of ?Modi?s dictatorial regime? and had called the chief minister ?the killer? of his son during a condolence meeting attended by Advani.

 The BJP chief and Modi pretended not to notice when the Pandya family walked out, but the uneasiness was palpable.

 Advani spoke for barely five minutes after that and chose not to mention the family, except for referring to the slain leader?s widow, Jagrutiben, who had insisted that the BJP president unveil the statue.

 The function was originally slated for March 27 but Advani skipped it amid mounting pressure from rebels to replace Modi. Vitthalbhai had threatened to unveil the statue if Advani did not turn up before April 6.

 The ceremony turned out to be a show of strength by the rebel camp. 

 The rebels gathered hours before Advani?s arrival, while Modi and his men sneaked in after the BJP chief reached and left unnoticed after his speech.

 The BJP chief noticed the good turnout and harped on the 25 ?glorious? years of his party?s existence. ?There is no political party in the world that has made such extraordinary progress within 25 years. This is because of the sacrifices of many people like Haren Pandya,? he said.

 Pandya, who was shot under mysterious circumstances on March 26, 2003, had consistently opposed Modi and was denied renomination from the Ellisbridge Assembly constituency ? part of Advani?s Gandhinagar parliamentary constituency. In his death, the Pandya became a symbol of dissidence based on principle.

 There was speculation that the chief minister might avoid sharing the dais with dissident leaders such as Keshubhai Patel and Suresh Mehta. He arrived with Advani but remained a mute spectator as nobody but the BJP chief spoke on the occasion.

 Rane: Congress calling

 Mumbai, July 13: The rebel eleven are sticking with their captain.

 Despite the promise of a pardon, the 11 legislators who had supported Narayan Rane today skipped the meeting at Vidhan Bhavan where 49 Shiv Sena MLAs formally welcomed Ramdas Kadam as leader of the legislature party.

 Three legislators had conveyed their inability to attend the meet, Sena chief whip Gajanan Kirtikar said.

 Yesterday, Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Balasaheb Kupekar had upheld Kadams election as Sena legislature party leader and Ranes expulsion. The former chief minister resigned as leader of Opposition in the House shortly after the Speakers ruling.

 In a bid to woo back the 11 MLAs supporting Rane and isolate him completely, Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray had said their anti-party behaviour will be pardoned and they could retain their Assembly membership. But the group did not turn up, indicating they would continue to support Rane.

 If the Sena legislators celebrated Kadams election, a tempering reminder came from the Speaker. Kupekar wrote to the 23 MLAs against whom Rane had filed a petition seeking their disqualification for not attending the meeting of legislators he had called on July 8. Only nine of the 63 Sena MLAs had turned up at the meeting, while two others faxed letters of support.

 The Speaker has sought an explanation from the 23 for their absence and asked them to reply within a week. The Sena has engaged top lawyers, including former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, for advice.

 The Congress has extended an open invitation to Rane to join the party. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said his party would welcome Rane if he wished to join.

 Deshmukh said it was now up to Rane to take a decision. When it was pointed out that Rane had expressed preference for a party whose path is smoother, the chief minister, in a lighter vein, said it is difficult to find which path is smoother in the monsoon.

 Rane was the sole Opposition MLA at the traditional chief ministers tea party Deshmukh hosted on the eve of the monsoon session of the Assembly last Sunday. He has also held talks with NCP chief Sharad Pawar about the possibility of joining the party, a partner in the Democratic Front government in the state.

 Neither Rane nor the group supporting him was present in the Assembly today.

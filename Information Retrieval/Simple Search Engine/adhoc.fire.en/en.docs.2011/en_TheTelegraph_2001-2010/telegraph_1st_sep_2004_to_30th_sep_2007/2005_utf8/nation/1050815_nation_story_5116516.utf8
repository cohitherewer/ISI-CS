 New Delhi, Aug. 14: The river inter-linking project needs to be urgently implemented to address the problem of flood and drought in the country, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam said today.

 Rainfall and flood are annual features in many parts of the country. Instead of thinking about inter-linking of rivers only at times of flood and drought, it is time that we implement this programme with a great sense of urgency, the President said in his Independence Day-eve address to the nation.

 Speaking in context of the Mumbai floods, he said all hurdles in the way should be overcome as the project held the promise of freeing the country from the endless cycle of flood and drought.

 The focus of his speech was, however, energy security as transition to total energy independence.

 Observing that energy is the lifeline of modern societies, he said ensuring energy independence should be the countrys first and highest priority and a target must be set to achieve it by 2030.

 This major 25-year national mission must be formulated, funds guaranteed and leadership entrusted without delay as public-private partnerships to our younger generation, now in their 30s, he said.

 He said increased investment in R amp;D was crucial to step up energy production. At the current rate of growth, the country would require 400,000 MW of power in 2030 against 121,000 MW today, he said.

 While coal-based power production would continue to be the mainstay, the country should turn increasingly to renewable sources like solar energy, bio fuels and power generation from municipal waste, he said.

 For true energy independence, a major shift in the structure of energy sources from fossil to renewable energy sources is mandated, he said.

 Nuclear power generation, too, would have to grow at least ten-fold, and for this it is essential to pursue the development of nuclear power using thorium reserves?.

 He said technology development in this area needed to be accelerated and India should join the international co-operation in the development nuclear fusion technology.

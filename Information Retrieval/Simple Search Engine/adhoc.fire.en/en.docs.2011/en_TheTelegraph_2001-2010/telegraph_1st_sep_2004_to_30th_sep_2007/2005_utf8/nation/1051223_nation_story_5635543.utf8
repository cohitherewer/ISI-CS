 Bachchan pals smell tax plot

 Bachchan: Victim?

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Dec. 22: Income-tax authorities today said their notice to a hospitalised Amitabh Bachchan had emerged out of routine procedure, but the actors friends saw in it further proof of serial victimisation by the Centre.

 Notices are sent to assessees at addresses given to the tax department, a senior income-tax official said. How do we know that the concerned man is in hospital? We cannot keep on chasing a person.

 But he refused to comment further. Who are we to comment when the matter is taken up with the Prime Ministers Office?

 Bachchan was reportedly slapped with a Rs 4.5-crore income-tax notice while recovering from abdominal surgery at Lilavati hospital. He signed a cheque for the amount though he had challenged the claim in the income-tax tribunal.

 The matter was reportedly taken up with Manmohan Singh by the actors friends, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party colleague, Amar Singh.

 The Prime Ministers response was very positive, a source close to the Samajwadi Party said without revealing much about how he reached that conclusion. 

 The Prime Minister is a very nice person of impeccable integrity and sensitivity. Otherwise he would not have sent a message to Amitabh Bachchan when he was in hospital, he said.

 The source said Bachchans politician friends suspect that the tax notice was the handiwork of a Congress ultra-loyalist who was desperately trying to ingratiate himself with the party brass. This loyalist, they said, had been out of the party for a while before returning to it.

 Another ultra-loyalist, too, had apparently targeted Bachchan.

 The friends cited how the Congress government in Goa had invited the actor to be the guest of honour at a pageantry on the sidelines of the international film festival.

 Then, this (other) ultra-loyalist of this government who was involved in the festival decided Bachchans name must be struck down.

 The same person had, they said, blacked out news of the filmstars illness on Doordarshan.

 Later, when Priya Ranjan Das Munshi took over as information and broadcasting minister, one the first things he did was to send flowers to the actor in hospital. Doordarshan, too, began beaming news of the actor.

 Earlier, Mulayam Singh told reporters that Bachchan had nothing to do with the Samajwadi Party though his wife Jaya had been elected to the Rajya Sabha on a Samajwadi ticket.

 But Amitabh Bachchan is not an individual. He is the property of the country, being an artiste of international repute. That is why there were prayers for him in temples, mosques and other religious places for his well-being.

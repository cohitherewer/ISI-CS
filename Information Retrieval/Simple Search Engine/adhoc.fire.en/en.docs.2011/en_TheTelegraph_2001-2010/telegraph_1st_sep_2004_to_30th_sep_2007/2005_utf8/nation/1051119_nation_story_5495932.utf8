 Sudarshan meets Advani 

 New Delhi: RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan met L.K. Advani for over an hour on Friday for talks on choosing the BJP presidents successor, reports our special correspondent.

 Advani is scheduled to step down in December.

 Ever since Advanis comments on Mohammad Ali Jinnah, all channels of dialogue between the top leaders of the BJP and the Sangh had snapped. 

 The Sangh has prevailed on the BJP to adapt itself to the idea of a collective leadership where office-bearers are elected and no individual commands all powers. 

 What remains to be done now, sources said, is to work out the modalities of the transition and choose a chief from among the second-rung leaders.

 Sudarshanji is going off to Assam from Delhi. He will be travelling to Bihar and Jharkhand after that. He will be back in Nagpur only around mid-December, a few days before the BJPs national executive, said a Sangh source.

 Azad on terror

 New Delhi: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister 

 Ghulam Nabi Azad has taken a tough stand against militants, 

 asking people to rise against them with one voice, 

 reports our correspondent.

When people rise against them in one voice, 90 per cent of terrorism would vanish. They should join the government for a decisive battle against terrorism. 

 He also made it clear that the government would hold talks only with those militants who abjure violence.

 Sleuths track blast suspects cash trail

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: Delhi police are investigating the money transfers made to the HDFC Bank account of alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba militant Tariq Ahmed Dar, the suspected mastermind of the serial blasts.

 Police sources said Rs 4.86 lakh was deposited in his account ? No. 4151000001613 ? on October 27, two days before the explosions, from the United Arab Emirates.

 The police, the sources added, are now looking into how around Rs 15 lakh found its way into Dars account over a period of three months before the attack that killed over 60 people.

 Dar had moved most of the money out of the account, and the sources said getting details about the account from which the money was transferred would be a time-consuming process. We cannot do this directly. It has to be done through the external affairs ministry, a police official said.

 Before the Rs 4.86 lakh he received on October 27, Dar received Rs 1.11 lakh on August 13, Rs 4.94 lakh on September 26 and Rs 4 lakh on October 13.

 This is not the first time that evidence of a West Asian route for funding terrorist activities in India has emerged. The sources said terrorist groups frequently open accounts under fictitious names to fund militant activities in Kashmir. For instance, the three Lashkar militants gunned down in Delhi last March also had accounts in HDFC and ICICI Banks to which money was being transferred from an account in Saudi Arabia.

 Mohammad Ashfaq, sentenced to death for the December 2000 attack on Red Fort, also used hawala money to fund terrorist activities.

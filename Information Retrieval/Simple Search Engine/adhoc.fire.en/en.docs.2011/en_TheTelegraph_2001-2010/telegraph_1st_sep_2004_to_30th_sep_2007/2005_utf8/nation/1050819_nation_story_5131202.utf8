 River talks under cloud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Yesterdays serial blasts in Bangladesh may have claimed a diplomatic victim: this months Delhi-Dhaka Joint River Commission meeting.

 Although no decision has yet been taken, a cloud hangs over water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshis trip to Dhaka for the August 30-31 talks. 

 We are watching the developments in Bangladesh very closely, a senior South Block official said. 

 India is cagey about formally calling off the meeting, for such a move will be seen in Dhaka as pre-judging the issue.

 The Indian leadership had cried off the Saarc summit in Dhaka earlier this year, citing the worsened law-and-order situation, following several bomb attacks on the Opposition Awami Leagues leaders. 

 The decision had strained Delhis relations with Dhaka. India does not want a repeat.

 Observers feel the blasts have sounded a wake-up call for the Bangladesh government, but are not sure how serious Dhaka is about taking on the Islamists.

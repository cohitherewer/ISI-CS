 Life term for 10 in riots case

 OUR BUREAU

 Patna/Bhagalpur, May 12: A Bhagalpur court today sentenced to life imprisonment the 10 people found guilty of killing five members of the minority community during the 1989 communal riots. 

 Additional district and sessions judge (VII) Navneet Kumar Pandey, who had found the 10 men guilty on Monday, announced the verdict under Sections 302 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code. They were also awarded imprisonment of two years and 10 years under Sections 153A and 436 respectively. All the sentences would run simultaneously, the court ordered.

 The convicts were found guilty of brutally killing Mohammad Zafar, Mohammad Kalam, Mohammad Sauf, Mohammad Mehboob Alam and Mohammad Basheer on October 14, 1989, at Kamarganj village under Sultanganj police station of the district.

 The case had been registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by one Badrul Islam. A total of 23 persons had been made accused but during the trial, the court acquitted 13 of them due to lack of evidence. A Congress government headed by Bhagwat Jha Azad was in office during the riots.

 So far, nearly 200 hundred people have been awarded punishment in various cases related to one of the worst communal riots since Independence in which nearly 1,000 people had been killed according to official records. Unofficial reports put the death toll much higher.

 Those convicted are Dhruv Bhagat, Arun Mandal, Jai Jai Yadav, Tarkeshwar Yadav, Ram Vilas Yadav, Hari Kishore Yadav, Naro Yadav, SiyaRam Yadav, Raj Kishore Yadav and Saryug Yadav. 

 All the 10 men maintained they were innocent. We will appeal to the higher court against this judgment. The case records are still in our favour and we hope to get justice from the higher courts, said Bhagat.

 The prosecution stated that on November 14, 1989, armed rioters raided the Kamarganj village and targeted the members of the minority community. The then officer-in-charge of Sultanganj police station, who had rushed to the spot after receiving information of the arson, had to face the ire of the rioters, who opened fire on the police. Police lodged an FIR on the basis of the statement of Badrul Islam, who lost his father and brother in the rioting. 

 Kurshid Ahmad, the special public prosecutor informed that 52 people had been named accused in the case earlier. But for want of substantial evidence, 24 persons were absolved of the charges in course of investigations. Finally, the police filed chargesheets against 28 people, of whom three died during the trial and two are absconding. On May 10, the court had acquitted 13 others who faced the trial.

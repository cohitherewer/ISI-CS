 Rinpas ban on hold

 RUDRA BISWAS

 Ranchi, March 1: Jharkhand today put the ban on patients from Bihar seeking treatment at the Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry and Allied Sciences (Rinpas) on hold following the intervention of Bihar chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanian.

 On February 25, the government imposed a blanket ban on the treatment of all mentally-ill patients from Bihar, as that state had failed to clear its dues worth Rs 32 crore. Patients from Bihar did not have to pay anything for treatment as the government of that state had taken the responsibility to clear the dues. 

 The notice, however, clarified that Rinpas would continue to serve all patients from Bihar and other states who pay for the services.

 Patients from Jharkhand, it added, will have to produce proof of domicile to claim free treatment.

 Following the publication of the report in this newspaper on February 26, Subramanian had told The Telegraph that he would take up the matter with the authorities concerned at the earliest.

 The Bihar chief secretary later got in touch with his counterpart in Jharkhand, P.P. Sharma, and requested for full details of the dues.

 Following his request to give Bihar some time to sort out the matter, the Jharkhand government is understood to have put the ban, which was to come into effect from today, on hold for 15 days.

 Officials here said they had nothing against patients from Bihar and all that they wanted was the government of that state to clear its dues. 

 ?About 250 patients from Bihar, who are admitted in Rinpas, continue to get the kind of attention they received before the decision was taken on February 25. However, since Rinpas has been an autonomous body since 1994, we badly need the money and for that the Bihar government has to clear its dues,? they added. 

 Apart from Bihar, Meghalaya owed around Rs 6 crore and Arunachal Pradesh Rs 2 crore to Rinpas.

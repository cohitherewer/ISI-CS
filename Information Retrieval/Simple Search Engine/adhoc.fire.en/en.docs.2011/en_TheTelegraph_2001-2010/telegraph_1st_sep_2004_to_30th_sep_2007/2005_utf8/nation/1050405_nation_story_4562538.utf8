 Teacher recruitment back on track

 - Steps afoot to revive charwaha schools

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, April 4: Bihar?s 65,000-plus trained teachers can now become voluntary Shiksha Mitras (para-teachers) for an honorarium of Rs 1,500 per month each.

 On March 30, the court quashed its interim stay on the appointment of panchayat Shiksha Mitras and directed the state to fill the quota by appointing trained candidates first, followed by the untrained intermediate/matriculate ones.

 In December 2004, the government had made a futile attempt to throw open teachers? posts to all candidates ? trained as well as untrained ? who were to be selected through an open test. It had then announced the plan for the recruitment of about 34,000 teachers. 

 The move was scuttled by the high court when it was challenged on the ground that it violated the guidelines of the National Council for Teachers? Education. The case is pending in the Supreme Court.

 ?The state wanted to appoint regular teachers, but the court stayed the action without giving concrete reasons. Thus, we are forced to go for Shiksha Mitras under the central scheme for which funds have been allotted,? primary education director Dharmendra Singh Gangwar said.

 The government?s decision last year to appoint Shiksha Mitras for primary schools on contract basis for 11 months, too, was challenged on the same ground. The court had then put an interim stay on it.

 In the hearing on March 30, the high court quashed the stay, and directed the state to appoint trained candidates first and the rest only if vacancies still existed. 

 ?We are committed to implement the central scheme of universalisation of education. The state will go ahead with the recruitment of Shiksha Mitras now on a priority basis,? chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam said.

 Fifty per cent of the seats are reserved for women candidates. If needed, in the non-trained category, matriculate women can be selected, he added.

 In another development, the Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC) has stepped in to revive the charwaha vidyalayas, which were started by Laloo Prasad Yadav in 1992. The venture met with failure mainly due to dearth of funds. Under President?s rule, Governor Buta Singh has evinced interest in reviving these schools, a source said.

 According to him, each student of these special schools is to get an annual grant of Rs 3,000 for uniforms, study material and other items. ?It?s still early days for the charwaha vidyalayas. We have only made a proposal. The governor will look into it before giving his consent,? a BEPC official told The Telegraph.

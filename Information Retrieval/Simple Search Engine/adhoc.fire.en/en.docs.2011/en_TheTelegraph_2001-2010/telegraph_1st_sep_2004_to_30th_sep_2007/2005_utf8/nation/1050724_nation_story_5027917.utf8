 Attack on Indian in Iraq 

 Baghdad, July 23 (AFP): An Indian businessman was wounded when armed men robbed him of $150,000 at his Baghdad office today, an interior ministry official said.

 The official had earlier said Jan Singh, 37, was kidnapped from his office in the upscale Mansur district of west Baghdad. 

 Armed men entered the office of BMS Company where this man was and hit him before leaving with $150,000, the official said. 

 Singh was treated in a hospital for stab wounds in his face and leg, the official added.

 In August 2004, three Indian truck drivers working for a Kuwaiti oil company were kidnapped and later released, resulting in an Indian government ban on all travel to Iraq.

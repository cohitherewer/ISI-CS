 BJP targets Mr Clean

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: The BJP today used the allegations against K. Natwar Singh to attack Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs Mr Cleanimage.

 Spokesman Arun Jaitley warned that his party would not allow the issue to die an early death but would raise it at every forum, including Parliament, which will meet for the winter session on November 21.

 The Paul Volcker report has named Natwar Singh, the external affairs minister, as one of the beneficiaries of the UN-managed, multi-billion-dollar oil-for-food programme in Iraq.

 Briefing reporters, Jaitley said Manmohan Singh, seen as Mr Clean, was forever giving clean chits to tainted ministers.

 Yesterday, the Prime Minister had come out in Natwar Singhs support, saying the facts mentioned in the UN report were insufficient to arrive at any adverse conclusion against his foreign minister. 

 Jaitley said the Prime Minister constituted a kangaroo court and without any investigation or (without) considering political and diplomatic consequences gave a pre-determined decision. 

 This stand, the BJP general secretary added, would seriously reflect upon his (the Prime Ministers) own credibility and continuation of the policies he has followed in the last few months. 

 Manmohan Singh, he added, had given clean chits to tainted ministers and governors of Bihar and Jharkhand in the past and condoned the conduct of absconding ministers. Now, he has given a clean chit to Natwar Singh... It is a complete national disappointment.

 Sadhu vs sadhu at funeral

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Stepping up the heat

 Lucknow, Nov. 27: Two groups of sadhus, one naked and the other clothed, fighting with stones and sticks at the cremation of a revered monk. Now Ayodhya has seen it all.

 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) needed to subdue Mahant Gyandas ? a leading sant and a dove on the Ram temple issue ? who has been holding all-faith prayers at Hanumangarhi, about 5 km from the disputed site. The death of a 90-year-old monk, Baba Maksudan, provided the perfect opportunity.

 Maksudan had an ashram at Hanumangarhi where he lived a paupers life with his followers, away from temple politics. He was close to Gyandas, head of the All-India Akhara Parishad that once governed all the akharas in the region but had seen its authority gradually eroded by defections to the VHP.

 After Maksudans death, as his followers and those of Gyandas prepared to light a pyre at the Sagaria Patti cremation ground on Thursday evening, about 20 naga sadhus loyal to the VHP arrived on the scene.

 The visitors said they had come to pay their respects to the dead man. But soon the naga sadhus ? who go naked as a mark of renunciation of everything worldly ? began asking about the properties Maksudan was leaving behind.

 They wouldnt accept that the monk had no possessions and a quarrel broke out. It turned into a free-for-all.

 The naga sadhus turned violent. They picked up pieces of wood from the pyres and began thrashing the rival group who, too, retaliated, said the senior superintendent of police, Faizabad, Avinash Chandra. Soon, they were attacking each other with stones and bricks.

 Ten sadhus are in hospital. Both sides have lodged FIRs but no arrests have been made.

 Sources said the VHP urgently needed a show of strength in Ayodhya with the next phase of its temple agitation due from December 2. The outfit has lost some credibility here after the BJP distanced itself from the movement and Gyandas has been emerging as a serious rival.

 Sources said the naga sadhus were followers of Mahant Madhuban Das, Gyandass No. 2 at the akhara parishad who has switched loyalties to the VHP.

 Gyandas is trying to create unrest. The naga sadhus were attacked unprovoked, Madhuban said on Friday. Gyandas, on the other hand, began a fast-unto-death on Saturday.

 The administration has slapped a case against me though I was not present at the crematorium during the trouble, he said. The administration must listen to me or I shall die here.

 The VHP has already scored a small victory against Gyandas. It has got a court to pass an interim injunction on his all-faith prayers ? attended by Muslims, Christians and Hindus ? by pleading that the sittings were polluting the holy town. It also secured a curb on mosque loudspeakers.

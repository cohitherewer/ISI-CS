 Get cell-savvy, else wife may dump you

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Sept. 20: Husbands without mobile phones, beware. If you dont get cell-smart, you might end up without a wife.

 In a remote Kashmir village, a woman has left her husband because he questioned her long conversations on the cellphone.

 Bashir Ahmad Khan, in his thirties, yesterday approached police to help trace his wife Guddi and his sister who has gone with her.

 The resident of Ongam, a village 60 km from here at Bandipora in northern Baramulla district, was upset when he found his wife glued to the phone he had not bought her.

 But when Bashir asked Guddi where she got the phone from and who she was calling, she was annoyed. She told her backdated husband to mind his own business.

 The couple quarrelled and at the end of it, Guddi took her belongings and stormed out of what had been her home for life, in true Bollywood style. 

 Her sister-in-law, about the same age, went with her.

 She left for some undisclosed destination. We are trying to locate her, a senior police officer said over the phone from Bandipore, where Bashir has filed the missing persons report.

 Mobile phones came to Kashmir just two years ago and caught up in a big way. 

 Despite erratic services in the Valley, cellphones have become a status symbol here and having one is seen as a sign of keeping up with the times.

 Bashir, a Class IV employee of the state food and supplies department, couldnt get himself one and paid with his wife.

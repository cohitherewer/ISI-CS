 Mumbai, Oct. 9: An Air 

 Sahara Boeing 737 from Calcutta skidded off the runway after 

 landing at Mumbai airport around 7.20 pm today. The pilot 

 managed to bring the aircraft, with 117 people on board, 

 to a halt on the soft ground a few metres off the runway, 

 but two passengers were injured.

 Mumbai airport director Sudhir Kumar at first said: Sahara aircraft has overshot (the runway). All passengers are safe. The airport is completely functional. Later, he confirmed that two passengers had suffered injuries.

 Airport sources said the plane had made an emergency landing. This is the second time that an aircraft has skidded off the runway here, posing a serious risk to passengers.

 On July 30, four days after the cloudburst that submerged Mumbai, an Air-India aircraft had overshot the secondary runway. The primary runway was closed after the floods damaged the instrument landing systems.

 It could not be confirmed if todays incident was in any way related to the modernisation programme at the airport. On Saturday, Terminal 1B was closed for domestic arrivals because of the programme. As a result, only departures of domestic flights were routed through Terminal 1 B.

 The arrivals of the private airlines, such as Jet and Sahara, were routed through Terminal 1A. This forced some flights to encircle the airport for close to 40 minutes before landing.

 The airport director denied that the modernisation at Terminal 1B had affected normal functioning.

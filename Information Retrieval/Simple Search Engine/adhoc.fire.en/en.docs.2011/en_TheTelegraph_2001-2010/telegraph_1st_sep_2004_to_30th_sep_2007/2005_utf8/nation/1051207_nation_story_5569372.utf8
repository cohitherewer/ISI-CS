 Forces seek lead role in disaster battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: The defence establishment has asked for a greater say in disaster management by getting all agencies to co-ordinate with the armed forces in relief and rescue after a natural calamity. 

 The National Disaster Management Authority headed by the Prime Minister with a former army chief as its executive head must be able to cut through bureaucratic hurdles and involve all agencies, the armed forces have said.

 Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash, who is also the chairman, chiefs of staff committee, today flagged issues raised after the armed forces were involved in taking relief to people after a succession of disasters this year ? the tsunami, the snow storms and the quake.

 He said composite task forces for disaster relief were urgently needed. Ships, aircraft, manpower, equipment and relief material should always be kept ready for the force. Standard operating procedures must be framed so that old lessons are not re-learnt after every disaster, he said.

 The navy chief said the issue of command and control in disaster relief must be resolved. Unless inter-agency lines are clearly drawn, there is potential for conflict and confusion. Such friction has the potential to derail relief operations.

 The admiral said civil agencies, international organisations and non-government organisations stay on in disaster zones long after the armed forces have withdrawn. Very often, the armed forces tend to think that they are the beginning and end of disaster relief. The fact is that while very often we may be the first on the scene, these organisations have to continue to work for months and, sometimes, years.

 Often there is duplication and lack of co-ordination which render these operations less effective, he added.

 Bhutan king

 New Delhi, Jan. 29: Bhutan king Jigme Singye Wangchuk considers the force used to flush out Northeastern rebels as ?the worst option? that Thimphu exercised in a long time, reports our correspondent.

 ?Taking military action against the insurgents was the last option. And the last option is always the worst option,? the king said.

 ?We tried every possible method to resolve the issue peacefully and through negotiations,? Wangchuk said.

 Thimphu had ?debated the issue for over seven years,? but military action had to be taken when the insurgents ?were in no mood to leave?, the king added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Kashmir hawks gun for general

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Musharraf

 Islamabad, April 25: General Pervez Musharraf has not stopped talking about what he calls were ?big diplomatic victories? during his Delhi trip, but his reported remarks about Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti as future leaders have stirred a controversy at home.

 On his return from a weeklong trip that took him from Delhi to Manila and Jakarta, the President said he was happy that India had finally agreed to discuss all issues, including Kashmir.

 His remarks have, however, irked hardliners on Kashmir who believe the government has taken a big U-turn on the issue.

 ?If Musharraf has said this, obviously this would have pleasantly surprised Manmohan Singh because we never accepted Kashmiri rulers as legitimate representatives,? said Amanullah Khan, who is known for his opposition to the merger of Kashmir with either India or Pakistan.

 The Telegraph had quoted Musharraf as telling Singh that Mehbooba, the chief of the ruling People?s Democratic Party; Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, who leads the moderate Hurriyat faction; and the National Conference?s Abdullah were at the top among Kashmir?s future leaders.

 While the remarks surprised Singh, the controversy they raised forced Pakistan?s foreign office to come out with a clarification. 

 ?There was no one present in President Musharraf?s meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, as it was a one-on-one interaction? therefore, what is appearing in the media based on what transpired in the meeting is mere speculation,? foreign ministry spokesperson Jalil Abbas Jilani told reporters in Islamabad today.

 Musharraf had told accompanying reporters his talks with Singh produced positive results, which were reflected in the joint statement that spoke of a strong desire, of both the Pakistani and Indian leadership, to address all issues, including Kashmir.

 ?The general environment between Pakistan and India has improved substantially as a result of my visit to New Delhi,? the President said.

 However, he did not mention the outcome of his meeting with Hurriyat leaders in Delhi, where he reportedly asked them to use their ?brains? and join the dialogue.

 Although he did not name any particular leader, his remarks were apparently directed against Syed Ali Geelani, a hardliner.

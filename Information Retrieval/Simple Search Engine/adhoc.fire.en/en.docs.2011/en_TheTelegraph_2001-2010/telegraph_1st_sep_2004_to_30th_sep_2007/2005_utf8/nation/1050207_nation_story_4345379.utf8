 Congress leader?s home blown up

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Feb. 6: Maoists, seething at the Nallamala forest setback, pressed on with their onslaught on political leaders by targeting a Congress mandal president in Karimnagar.

 In the early hours yesterday, CPI (Maoist) activists went to the house of Mahdevpur mandal president Bapi Reddy. Not finding him home, they blew up his house along with a new tractor and a scooter.

 In Karimnagar and Warangal districts, Maoists gunned down four persons, including two elected representatives.

 ?We have begun a systematic identification of police informers in the villages and will weed them out,? Maoist leader Sudhakar had warned at a news conference on Friday. As if on cue, six persons were beaten up for allegedly informing police of Maoist hideouts a day later. The Naxalites also exploded a landmine in Guntur, injuring six police personnel travelling in an autorickshaw.

 In a further setback to the police, a Maoist leader who was engaged in a shootout at a college in Medak escaped after a nearly three-hour encounter. The setback was partially offset with the arrest of six members of a Janashakti dalam in East Godavari district.

 On Friday, the rebels had called bandhs in Warangal, Karimnagar and Khammam. 

 After the near-encounter in the Nallamala forests ? where Greyhound commandos had surrounded top Naxalite leaders on Thursday but allowed them safe passage after instructions from the state home minister ? jittery legislators of the Congress, the Telengana Rashtra Samiti and the Telugu Desam Party are moving towards Hyderabad. Legislators from Prakasham and Guntur districts, which are closer to the Nallamala forests, have allegedly been threatened with dire consequences if anything happens to the Maoist leaders.

 ?If anything had happened to the Maoist top guns ? Ramakrishna and the others ? on Thursday, one would have to forget the peace talks and the police would have been on the run for their lives,? said G. Kalyan Rao, civil rights leader and an emissary of the CPI (Maoist).

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, who returned from China on Friday night, reviewed the law and order situation. Reddy cautioned the police against any ?foolhardy? attempts and directed the security forces not to take any rash step. But he said: ?The peace process cannot be exploited by the Maoists to leverage their mass support and recruit misguided youth.?

 However, K. Jana Reddy, the Andhra home minister who had co-ordinated with the security forces and Maoists for safe passage to the Naxalite leaders in Nallamala was not happy with the developments. ?I wish such hair raising incidents do not recur during the course of the peace talks which we are confident of resuming in a matter of few weeks,? he said.

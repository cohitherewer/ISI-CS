 Sonia to visit Pak after Singh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 18: The Prime Minister first, please.

 Branded a ?super PM? by the Opposition, Sonia Gandhi would rather wait until Manmohan Singh?s first visit to Pakistan before she takes up President Pervez Musharraf?s invitation.

 The general had renewed his invitation to the chairperson of the central coalition when he met her yesterday. Sonia has accepted the invitation.

 Sonia?s visit to Pakistan has been under consideration for quite some time. A tentative proposal for a trip in March was also considered. But, according to Congress sources, it was put on hold for ?protocol reasons?. Sonia, the sources said, apparently wants the Prime Minister to go first because, as head of the ruling coalition, her visit could have a huge profile.

 At their 40-minute meeting, Musharraf is understood to have conveyed his admiration for Sonia?s success in giving shape to the alliance at the Centre and her decision to renounce the post of Prime Minister. It was Sonia?s second interaction with Musharraf. The last time they met was in 2001 when the Pakistan President visited India. 

 While Sonia is cautious about timing her visit, her party today saw a paradigm shift in Indo-Pak ties. ?The government had the confidence to push through the confidence-building measures and bring about a paradigm shift in the relations between the two countries,? spokesperson Anand Sharma said.

 He said the thaw in relations was possible because of the government?s commitment to serious and continuous dialogue between the two countries.

 The spokesperson also pointed to his party?s consistent view that irrespective of the situation, talks between the neighbours should continue. ?We said so even when the bilateral ties had hit a low (three years ago),? he said. The new set of measures for enhancing people-to-people contact would open an era of all-round cooperation, Sharma added.

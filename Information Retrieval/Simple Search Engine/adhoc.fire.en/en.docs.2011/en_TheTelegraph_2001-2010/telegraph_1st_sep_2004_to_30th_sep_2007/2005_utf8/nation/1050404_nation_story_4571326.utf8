 DMK allies in power rush

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, April 3: With just a year to go for the Tamil Nadu elections, the DMK?s allies at the Centre are eyeing a share of the state?s power pie, much to its discomfiture.

 DMK chief M. Karunanidhi managed to muffle the Congress when he bulldozed its leader E.V.K.S. Elangovan into withdrawing his recent statement that his party should be part of a DMK-led coalition government if the ruling ADMK is toppled.

 But there is trouble from another front ? the PMK is raising the pitch for a United Progressive Alliance government in Chennai.

 The Congress and the PMK are the DMK?s partners both at the Centre and in the state?s Democratic Progressive Alliance, which also comprises the MDMK and Left parties. 

 The Congress was forced to go back on its demand after Karunanidhi issued veiled threats to withdraw support to the Manmohan Singh government in Delhi till it disowned Elangovan?s statement. The PMK, however, has no such compulsions.

 Sources said the PMK is set to demand 60 of the 234 Assembly seats and four ministers in the state cabinet, plus a seat in the Upper House. According to a senior party leader, the demand would be made at an appropriate time.

 The DMK?s state allies are of the view that it should not contest more than 100 seats, and the remaining 134 should be distributed among them.

 ?For long, the DMK has not allowed others to share power. Times have changed. There is a UPA coalition government at the Centre and what is the harm if the experiment is replicated in Chennai? The DMK alone cannot dislodge the ADMK government. It was due to the collective effort and proper alliance that the ADMK drew a blank in the Lok Sabha elections, and the DMK better understand this,? said a senior PMK leader.

 Asked whether the MDMK, too, wants a coalition government in Chennai, its leader C. Krishnan said: ?The party took a decision not to join the UPA at the Centre. As far as the state is concerned, we have not taken a decision yet. There is still time and we will formulate our strategy shortly.?

 Sources said unlike the Congress, which does not have easy options, the PMK and the MDMK could forge an alliance with the ADMK in the next elections if Karunanidhi acts tough. 

 Eager to drive a wedge between the UPA partners, ally-less chief minister Jayalalithaa has already started wooing the PMK and MDMK.

 Keeping a post-Karunanidhi scenario in mind, PMK chief S. Ramadoss and MDMK leader Vaiko are busy building a cadre for their parties. 

 For Karunanidhi, who is striving hard to put his son M.K. Stalin in the driver?s seat, Vaiko is posing a threat. Ramadoss, on the other hand, is trying to form a sub-alliance with other caste parties like the Dalit Panthers of India, led by T. Thirumavalavan, and a prominent leader of the backward Thevars.

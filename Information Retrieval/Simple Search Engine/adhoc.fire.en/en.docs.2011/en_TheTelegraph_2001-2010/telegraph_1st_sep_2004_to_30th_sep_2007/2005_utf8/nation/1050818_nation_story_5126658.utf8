 Cop reforms on plate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: The countrys cops could be headed for a makeover.

 With the parliamentary consultative committee of the home ministry slated to review police reforms tomorrow, large-scale changes are expected to be rung in.

 Some of the reforms on the talks table are protection of tenure of police officers; increasing minimum qualification of constables and sub-inspectors; reducing recruitment levels in the non-IPS category; and a new act to replace the 1861 police act.

 The consultative committee will examine recommendations made by a review panel set up under the chairmanship of the home secretary in December 2004. The panel had submitted its report in March 2005 in which 49 recommendations were made for immediate implementation.

 A senior home ministry official said every recommendation had wide-reaching implications and once implemented could bring in a massive attitudinal and behavioural change.

 The core idea of the recommendations is to bring down the work pressure on police personnel, make them accountable while at the same time giving them protection, and inculcate habits in police to deal with the public in a civilised manner.

 While giving relief to police personnel, the recommendations also call for disciplinary action against them for non -registration of crime, which is a major problem, he said.

 The recommendations also look at increasing motivation levels by improving welfare, housing, pay and promotional avenues of the constabulary. At present, a constable gets a time-bound promotion to head constable after 12 years, but even this is not certain.

 The recommendations are holistic in nature. They also deal with the need for improved laws and professional expertise to deal with new challenges such as federal, organised and economic crimes and facilitating a role for the Centre vis-?-vis the states in matters that threaten national and internal security of the country, the official said.

 The home ministry has sent a copy of the review panel report to all states and Union territories with a request for immediate implementation.

 The consultative committee that will meet tomorrow comprises the home minister, and his three junior ministers, 10 Lok Sabha members and eight Rajya Sabha members.

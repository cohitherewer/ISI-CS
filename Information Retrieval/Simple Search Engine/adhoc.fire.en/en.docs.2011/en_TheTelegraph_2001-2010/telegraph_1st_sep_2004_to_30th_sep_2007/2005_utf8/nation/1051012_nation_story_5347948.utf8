 Child marriage 

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: Delhi police have been accused of refusing to register complaints against child marriages citing the recent Delhi High Court judgment allowing the marriage of a minor (under-18) girl if it has taken place with her consent, reports our correspondent.

 Womens rights group Janwadi Mahila Samiti alleges the Jehangirpuri station house officer didnt try to stop the marriage of a 13-year-old girl despite a complaint from her father. The girls mother, who is separated from her father, was marrying her off. 

 Samiti secretary Asha Lata said: The SHO pleaded helplessness and produced a copy of the judgment. The police are misusing the judgment. In that case, the girl was 16 years and eight months old and had married of her own will.

 Delhi gift

 New Delhi, April 15 (PTI): A special gift awaits Pervez Musharraf in Delhi ? his birth certificate.

 New Delhi Municipal Corporation has found the record of Musharraf?s birth and is getting the certificate ready, on the government?s instructions. 

 ?We have found an entry for a male child born on August 11, 1942, identified as ?son of a Mr Musharraf? and delivered at the Lala Girdharilal Maternity Hospital,? a spokesperson said. 

 During her visit last month, Musharraf?s mother had gone to the hospital and said she would like the birth certificates of both her sons, Javed and Pervez.

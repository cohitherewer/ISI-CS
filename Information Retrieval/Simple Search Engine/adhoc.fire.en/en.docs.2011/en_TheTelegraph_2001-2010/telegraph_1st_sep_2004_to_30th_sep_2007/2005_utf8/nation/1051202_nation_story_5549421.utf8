The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 EC to keep eyes peeled for rigging in Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tandon: On vigil

 Calcutta, Dec. 1: Every constituency in Bengal will be under the Election Commissions glare during next years Assembly polls. 

 There would be two observers for each Assembly segment and one more for every three, chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon said today.

 Earlier, one observer would monitor seven Assembly constituencies.

 Amid clamour from the Opposition that steps taken during the Bihar polls be taken in Bengal as well, Tandon, who was in the city today, said there would be 588 observers for the 294 Assembly constituencies in addition to another 98 special observers. 

 A general observer and an expenditure observer will man each constituency. A special observer will be appointed for every three constituencies.

 We took some new steps in Bihar and our experience there has been good. Depending on the situation in Bengal, these steps ? like deploying tough overseers like K.J. Rao ? will be implemented, Tandon told reporters after a meeting with district magistrates of the Presidency division. He expanded on his plans during the meeting with the district magistrates of Howrah, North and South 24-Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad and the district election officer of Calcutta.

 Well keep a strict watch on the election machinery, which we expect to be strictly apolitical. If we find anything to the contrary, the matter will be severely dealt with, Tandon told the officials. He asked the district magistrates of Nadia, Murshidabad and North 24-Parganas to ensure that Bangladeshi immigrants did not turn up as voters. 

 I told the DMs what I expect from them. Weve also decided to shift the CEOs (chief electoral officers) office outside Writers Buildings so that he is accessible to all political parties, Tandon added. 

 On the controversy raging over the directive that people against whom non-bailable arrest warrants were pending would have their names struck off voters lists if they did not surrender, Tandon said: In Bihar, 1.5 lakh warrants were executed after we issued this directive. It should be seen in proper perspective. Were giving these people a chance to show up before the authorities or else theyll be barred from the elections.

 Asked if the elections would be conducted in phases as in Bihar, Tandon said: Four other states are going to polls at almost the same time as Bengal. Well take a number of factors into account? availability of central forces, law and order situation in the state, school examinations, public holidays and the weather. 

 Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and party general secretary Mukul Roy met Tandon at Raj Bhavan. 

 Mamata said: I expressed happiness over the way he conducted elections in Bihar and requested him that officials like K.J. Rao and Afzal Amanullah be appointed in Bengal to ensure genuine voters were not denied their right.

 Rao, the poll panel adviser for Bihar, is being credited with ensuring the free and fair elections there. Amanullah was deployed as a special observer in Bengal during last years Lok Sabha polls. He had bracketed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees state with Rabri Devis Bihar and the Left Front alleged that he exceeded his brief. 

 A delegation of CPM leaders comprising Madan Ghosh, Sukhendu Panigrahi and Rabin Deb requested Tandon not to relocate polling booths near smaller party and union offi-ces which, they suggested, might be asked to remain closed on election day. 

 The poll panel had said that all booths close to offices of political parties and their affiliates would be shifted. 

 The chief election commissioner inaugurated the electoral information system on SMS and said: I made eight visits to Bihar before (the) elections there?. Ill visit Bengal as often as I can.

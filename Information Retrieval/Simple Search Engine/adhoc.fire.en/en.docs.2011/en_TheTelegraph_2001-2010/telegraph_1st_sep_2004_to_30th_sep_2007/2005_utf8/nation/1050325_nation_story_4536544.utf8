 Meera thanks saint saviour

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 24: Pakistani actor Meera attributed her Bollywood-style rescue yesterday from a forced return flight to Lahore to ?divine intervention?.

 ?It is a miracle by Nizamuddin (Auliya) baba that I am here with you all, taking part in this peace march. Otherwise, it was just not possible,? she told participants of an India-Pakistan peace march from Delhi to Multan.

 The actor, mired in a controversy in Pakistan over an onscreen kiss in Mahesh Bhatt?s Nazar, was almost sent back home from Delhi after immigration officials found that her visa mentioned Mumbai as the port of entry.

 After a six-hour detention at the airport last evening, she was turned back to Pakistan. ?I had been put on a flight to Lahore and the plane had started moving when the permission to enter Delhi was finally given.?

 In a masala movie finale, officials of the home and foreign ministries had raced to reach the airport and get her off the plane.

 Shortly after, Meera, the first Pakistani actor to feature in an Indian film after the countries took steps to improve relations last year, and filmmaker Bhatt had gone to the Sufi saint?s dargah and offered prayers. The actor believes she was rescued by the saint.

 This morning, Meera visited Mahatma Gandhi?s samadhi at Rajghat along with Bhatt and the peace marchers. She had come to Delhi at Bhatt?s request to express solidarity with the Indian and Pakistani participants but failed to make it to the inaugural because of the airport hitch.

 Meera also prayed for peace between the two countries which the actor said she just had to do after her harrowing experience. ?Zyadti to bahut hui (The airport reaction was in excess). But I thank the Indian authorities for finally allowing me to come here.?

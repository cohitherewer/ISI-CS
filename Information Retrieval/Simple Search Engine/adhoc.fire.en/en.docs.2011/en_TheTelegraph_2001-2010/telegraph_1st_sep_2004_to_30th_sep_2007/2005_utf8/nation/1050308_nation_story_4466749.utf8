 Indian doctor on US varsity board

 Florida has appointed an Indian-American physician based 

 in St Petersburg to the powerful board of governors which 

 oversees working of universities and other educational institutions.

 Akshay M. Desai was appointed by governor Jeb Bush, who is the brother of President George W. Bush. The doctor is one of six persons appointed to the apex body that frames policy and oversees the management of state universities.

 The members will have to be confirmed by the state senate and would serve for staggered terms of seven years, during which they will ?operate, regulate, control and be fully responsible for the management of the whole university system? that includes 10 universities with a combined budget of $4.2 billion.

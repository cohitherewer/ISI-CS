 Guns trigger twin theories

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: The second round of firing along the LoC and the persistent disclaimers by Pakistan have thrown up two possibilities.

 First, that the weapons used by the Pakistan Army could have been acquired by non-state actors (militants). Second, that there is a disconnect between the top brass of the Pakistani military and the deployment at the ground level.

 The Indian Army has not ? as of tonight ? categorised the latest round of firing as a ceasefire violation. But sources said the incident dragged tension along the LoC from Poonch to Rajouri.

 Earlier in the day, New Delhi and Islamabad had said ?nothing will be done to heighten tension?. Pakistan had also formally conveyed to India that its army had not shelled Indian Army positions in Poonch on Tuesday.

 India had termed the mortar shelling of the Durga and Banwat posts in Poonch sector as a violation of the 13-month ceasefire.

 ?The matter will be settled at the level of the operational officers and not at the political level,? defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said here even as the Indian director-general of military operations and his Pakistani counterpart spoke on the telephone hotline for the second consecutive day.

 Yesterday, the Indian director-general of military operations, Lt Gen. A.S. Bahia had given the coordinates and the details of the firing to his counterpart, Pakistan?s director of military operations Major General Mohammad Yousuf. The Pakistani side had said it would investigate the incident and get back. Today, the Pakistani official said the firing was investigated but denied that it was by the Pakistan Army.

 Indian Army sources said: ?Our position is unchanged.? They said they still look upon it as a unilateral violation of the ceasefire by Pakistan. The Pakistani denial and the absence of a comment by the Indian side suggested that the two sides were taking it as an aberration till this evening. But who fired and why are still unanswered questions.

 The Indian vice-chief of army staff, Lt Gen. B.S. Thakur, had said yesterday that 60 mm mortars were used both by the Pakistani army and militants but 82 mm rounds were used by Pakistani army battalions. The Durga post was fired upon by a round of 60 mm mortars and the Banwat by 12 rounds of 82 mm mortars.

 The dispute will be sorted out at the level of operational commanders and did not call for political dialogue, defence minister Mukherjee said.

 The defence minister?s statement that the firing on the LoC does not call for political-level talks reflected the eagerness in New Delhi and Islamabad to put the incident behind them. It remains to be seen whether Thursday night?s firing will have an impact on that resolve.

 Mukherjee said the talks at the level of the operational commanders would be carried out ?in the spirit of the confidence-building measures?. India has proposed conventional military confidence-building measures to Pakistan. Islamabad has not yet responded to the proposals.

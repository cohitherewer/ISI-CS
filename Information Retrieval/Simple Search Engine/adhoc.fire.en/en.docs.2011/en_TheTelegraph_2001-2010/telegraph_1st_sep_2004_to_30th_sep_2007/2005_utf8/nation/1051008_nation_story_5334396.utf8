 Buta hijacks CMs meet

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Chandigarh, Oct. 7: Night huddles by top Congress leaders; a walkout by the home minister from a news conference. The Congress chief ministers conclave here has virtually been hijacked by the Buta Singh controversy.

 The entire party brass, here for the two-day meeting, is now wracked by the question whether Buta ? slammed by the Supreme Court for his role in the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly ? should continue at Patna Raj Bhavan or go.

 Late in the night, the Congress said Butas fate would be decided collectively by the United Progressive Alliance partners as well as parties that support the government from outside.

 You must realise that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is heading a coalition government of which 22 parties are constituents, AICC general secretary Ambika Soni told a TV channel. 

 And there are other parties supporting it from outside. Therefore, decision in such matter cannot be taken by an individual or by a certain party of the UPA. This has to be a collective decision.

 She said the decision would be taken once copies of the apex court judgment were made available.

 Earlier, there were indications that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi might call a meeting of the partys core group tonight after the Prime Minister arrived here to address the conclave tomorrow.

 Barring human resource development minister Arjun Singh, who is abroad, all other members of the core group ? home minister Shivraj Patil, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, urban development minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel and Soni ? are already here.

 Congress leaders believe Delhi may have already sounded Buta on whether he is willing to step down on his own. The indications are that Buta prefers a transfer to another state.

 In the afternoon, the Congress had got lower-rung leaders to informally meet the media ? hungry for the partys reactions to the court order ? hoping that when the official briefings take place, the questions would be confined to the discussions at the conclave. It did not work.

 Patil, at his news conference, faced a barrage of questions on whether Buta would continue in office.

 These momentous decisions are taken only after due consideration. We would like to be correct and just, the home minister said. He added that neither the government nor the party had seen details of the court order.

 Even so, Patil said, governments have generally abided by court judgments. They (governments) dont find fault with them (judgments).

 Patil also pointed out that the Assembly dissolution had been debated and approved by Parliament.

 As the journalists persisted with questions about Butas fate, Patil abruptly ended the briefing and returned to the conclave.

 Varmas Factory eyes slice of market

 Mumbai, Dec. 6: Ram Gopal Varmas factory is going public. 

 The prolific filmmaker and producer, who appropriately named his production company The Factory, announced today that the RGV Film Factory Limited (RGVFFL) will be raising Rs 100 crore of equity through an initial public offering (IPO). It will come out with the IPO within three months.

 Varma, who has directed Satya, Rangeela, Company, Bhoot and Sarkar, said his company turned public because of the potential market of Indian films in the country and abroad. Not only is India the worlds largest producer of feature films, but in terms of the audience size, it is also the largest market, he said.

 I also believe that Indian films can become a much bigger commercial force in the global arena. Being a publicly listed company will help RGVFFL towards this end by making fundraising a relatively simpler exercise.

 Varma has produced 53 films in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil and directed 24 of these.

 In opening up his Factory, Varma is following in the footsteps of several other heavyweights from Bollywood and the entertainment world, but not all have fared well. An industry person said only Balaji Telefilms and PNC have done well at the stock exchange.

 At the Bombay Stock Exchange today, filmmaker Subhas Ghais Mukta Arts scrip closed at Rs 44.10. The share is ruling below the issue price of Rs 165. Mukta Arts went public in 2000 with much fanfare.

 Producer Pritish Nandys film corporate Pritish Nandy Communications (PNC) also went public in 2000 at an issue price of Rs 155 per share. Today the scrip of the company, which has issued bonus shares in the past, closed at Rs 50.50. 

 TIPS, the music company that also produces films, had an initial issue price of Rs 325 per share. Today it closed at Rs 42.20 per share.

 Balaji Telefilms, of the K-serials, had an initial share price of Rs 130. The TV company that has produced a few films closed at Rs 129.50 today. 

 UTV, the television and film production company that went public in 2005, had an initial price of Rs 130 per share. But today it closed at Rs 168.30.

 The performance of the stocks may not reflect directly on the financial health of the company, but as the industry acknowledges, equity investment in films has a long way to go. The Indian film business is too fragmented and disorganised to catch up with it in a major way in the near future.

 It will take time for such attempts at corporatisation to take shape, admitted a Varma spokesperson.

 That has not daunted Varma. My experience, both as a producer and director in this industry, has taught me how to conceive projects, execute them on time and create enormous brand equity in the market, thereby bringing economic value to my partners. With RGVFFL, I propose to do the same with my shareholders.

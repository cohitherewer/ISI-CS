The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 A thought for nobodys child 

 MANAN KUMAR AND SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 New Delhi/Mumbai: If you cant take care of Mumbai, let the milch cow take care of itself.

 A proposal once branded outlandish has bobbed up from the waterlogged streets of the metropolis to confront politicians.

 My suggestion to Mumbais problems is take politics out from it and leave it as a commercial capital and make it a Union Territory, noted lawyer and Rajya Sabha member Fali Nariman said in the House today.

 The mere suggestion was enough to prompt Pramod Mahajan, who had moved a calling attention motion on Mumbai floods, thunder: Any move to take Mumbai away from Maharashtra will not be tolerated.

 Narimans repartee then should strike a chord among Mumbaikars who tasted first-hand the week-long fury of the rains. 

 The lawyer said his suggestion stems from the fact that successive governments have failed in providing proper administration to Mumbai.

 Mahajan then said: You are not in politics and do not know what kind of reactions and serious implications it can have.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram should know. In May, he had suggested a decentralised sub-national structure of governance. He had said that places like Mumbai and Delhi were virtual city states that need city governments with near-sovereign authority. 

 Chidambarams statement was interpreted by some as a separate Mumbai concept, sparking an outburst from Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray.

 Undeterred by Mahajans opposition, Nariman cited the example of Jamshedpur. It was taken over by Tata and it is now the best administered city of Jharkhand. If there is any solution to Mumbai, it is depoliticisation of Mumbai, he said.

 Vijay Mahajan of Bombay First, an NGO initiative for Mumbais development, said later: Mumbai should be converted into a city state. If it is made into a city state and administered separately, it will see much better development like Delhi has.

 Cities like New York and London are run by a mayor elected directly. Mumbai badly needs someone who is in charge.

 Mumbai pays Rs 55,000 crore or 65 per cent of the taxes collected by the Centre, but gets only 5 per cent in return, he added.

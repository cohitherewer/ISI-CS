 Cold comfort, 10 years after death

 New Delhi, April 26 (PTI): The apex consumer court has ordered a compensation of Rs 3 lakh to the family of an IIT Kanpur student who died because of a government hospital?s ?gross negligence and lapses? after a road accident 10 years ago.

 Tapas Mishra succumbed to his head injuries 15 hours after he was admitted to the Lala Lajpat Rai hospital in Kanpur. 

 The court said Mishra?s condition was compounded by the ?gross negligence? of hospital authorities who took too long to diagnose the extent of the injury and denied him prompt treatment by a specialist.

 The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission also took serious view of the loss of three precious hours as Mishra was taken in a trolley to a CT-scan centre some distance away without any medical escort and found the hospital ?wanting in duty of care in administration of the treatment?.

 The court rejected the hospital?s contention that the victim was not a ?consumer? as it renders free service and that he died due to ?fat embolism?, an internal blood clotting beyond its control. 

 Justice K.S. Gupta, the commission?s presiding member, and another member, B.K. Taimni, said the hospital ?cannot get away from its actions or lack of positive action ? which are basically administrative but could have played a pivotal role in saving his life?.

 ?Life of a young man cannot be brought back and no amount of compensation may fill the gap, yet in the fact and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the complainants need to be compensated for acts of negligence,? the court said. Mishra?s parents and brothers had filed the complaint. 

 ?No case of medical negligence leading to death has been proved, but serious lapses which can be termed negligence on the part of the hospital has been proved,? the court said.

 Mishra and his friends were travelling in a tempo on December 4, 1995, when the vehicle rammed into a stationary truck. The impact of the collision threw Mishra off the vehicle. His friends took him to the IIT health centre where he was attended by nurses and the dressing staff.

 Mishra was brought to the Lajpat Rai hospital at 3 am but was taken to the emergency ward of an orthopaedic surgeon only around 9.30 am. His friends were told that the doctor was busy till then.

 Even after cerebral oedema was detected around 11, the doctor began the treatment only at 2.30 pm. Mishra passed away around 5.30 after experiencing acute breathlessness.

 Mishra?s family had also named the primary health centre as respondents for allegedly not mentioning various injuries, including the one in the head and the temple, while referring the case to the Lajpat Rai hospital. 

 But the court came to the primary centre?s defence, saying that despite being not equipped to handle emergencies, the staff there had taken due care of the accident victim and administered vital injections and medicines.

 The court also criticised Mishra?s friends for taking him to the far away health centre with no facility to handle emergency cases ignoring a hospital which was just a kilometre away. 

 ?A lot of time was also spent by the friends of the deceased in organising funds to defray the expenses for the CT scan and their negligence cannot be ignored,? the court said.

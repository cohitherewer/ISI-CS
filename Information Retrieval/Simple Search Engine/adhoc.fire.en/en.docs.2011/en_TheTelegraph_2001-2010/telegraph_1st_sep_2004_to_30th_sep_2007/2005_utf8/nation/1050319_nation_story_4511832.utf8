 Delhi steps on the gas, in spite of US

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, March 18: India has decided to go ahead with the proposed gas pipeline with Tehran despite the US?s concerns over Iran.

 Delhi is also hopeful that if everything goes according to schedule, India, Pakistan and Iran will be able to sign a trilateral ?overarching? agreement on the project by the middle of this year.

 US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had raised America?s concerns over Iran during her recent visit to Delhi.

 But sources said that at no point did Rice or any other US official raise any objection to the project. Also, ?neither US ambassador David Mulford nor Condoleezza Rice has asked the government to go slow on the proposed gas pipeline?, said a senior South Block official.

 He pointed out that Rice had only told the Indian leadership about Washington?s concerns over Iran. ?Though we do not agree with the US analysis, we allowed them to raise their concerns.?

 The official was quick to add that ?it should not be interpreted as India accepting the US?s views on Iran and West Asia, as the two sides differ sharply on these issues?.

 That the two sides could go ahead with other aspects of their bilateral relations despite the differences on Iran indicated the maturity in India-US ties.

 An Indian delegation, led by foreign ministry additional secretary Talmiz Ahmed, had visited Tehran between March 5 and 6 for techno-economic discussions. Another meeting there is likely at the end of next month to firm up both sides? positions on the project.

 A team of Pakistani officials is also scheduled to be in Tehran in the next few weeks for conducting similar discussions with its Iranian counterpart.

 The plan is for the three countries to meet, probably in Islamabad, by this summer and sign a trilateral agreement.

 India has made it clear that it is keen on signing an agreement with Iran while the latter can sign a separate agreement with Pakistan because Delhi is not dealing directly with Islamabad in getting the gas.

 But to boost investor confidence, India is willing to sign with Pakistan and Iran an ?overarching? agreement that will clearly indicate the three governments? commitment to the pipeline project.

 After the last meeting in Tehran, there are four aspects on which India is concentrating to ensure that everything is in place when a formal agreement is signed.

 The queries pertain to the technical aspects of the pipeline, its length, the distance it will travel, and the route it will take to reach India.

 India also wants to know the price at which Iran will sell the gas and whether it would be attractive enough to Delhi.

 Further, it wants to clarify legal questions on the laws that will come into play in a dispute and the authority that will bring about an arbitration.

 The Indian establishment also wants to ensure that the pipeline will not force it to compromise on national security.

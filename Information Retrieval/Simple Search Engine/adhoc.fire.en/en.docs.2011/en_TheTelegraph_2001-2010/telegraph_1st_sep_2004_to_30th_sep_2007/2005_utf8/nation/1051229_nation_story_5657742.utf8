 President or not, Jaya wont move

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: Chennai has suddenly dropped off Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakses home-bound flight-path, apparently because Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa indicated that she would meet him only on her terms.

 The chief minister insisted that the president call on her, instead of she going to him, sources in New Delhi said. 

 Unable to accept a demand that went against protocol, an embarrassed external affairs ministry cancelled Rajapakses Chennai visit, tentatively set for December 30. 

 The current flare-up in Lanka that has raised the spectre of a fresh round of civil war could be the reason behind Jayalalithaas reported reluctance to call on the president.

 Jayalalithaas strong stand against the LTTE is well known and the Opposition MDMK, seen as championing the Tamil cause in Lanka, has been exerting pressure on the Centre to modify its hands-off policy on the island. 

 With the Assembly election due next year, the chief minister could have felt that a meeting with the Lankan president could be misconstrued by the MDMK and turned into an election weapon.

 Sources in the chief ministers office in Chennai, however, said no meeting had been officially scheduled and the chief minister had not set any terms for meeting the president. A meeting can still take place, they added.

 The ministry of external affairs, too, sought to play down the incident, saying that the Tamil Nadu programme of the visiting president was tentative and was based on mutual convenience.

 Given the fact that the president has a full schedule in Delhi and other places and the fact that the chief minister was not available that day, the programme has been changed, a foreign ministry spokesperson said.

 The Lankan president will now go to the Guruvayoor temple in Kerala as scheduled but skip Chennai on his way back to Colombo.

 SC sets August date to decide Bihar poll fate

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, July 27: The 

 Supreme Court today listed an application for hearing on 

 August 5 to decide whether fresh elections should be held 

 in Bihar or the dissolved Assembly be revived.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti, Justices C.K. Thakker and P.K. Balasubramanyan also withdrew earlier notices to Bihar governor Buta Singh on the ground that under Article 361, governors cannot be called to answer questions in the court of law.

 However, we can annul his (the governors) actions, but let us not issue notices to him now.... We will also consider whether we can issue notices to the governor at a later stage of the case, Justice Lahoti verbally observed.

 Todays development of listing the hearing for August 5 has raised the hopes of legislators of the dissolved Bihar Assembly who do not want fresh elections. 

 They want the dissolved Assembly to be revived so that the governor would be compelled to call upon the single-largest party or grouping to form the government.

 Rameswar Prasad Chaurasia, Kishore Kumar Munna, Rampravesh Rai and Anil Kumar ? all MLAs of the dissolved Assembly ? had filed petitions challenging the presidential proclamation dissolving the House. 

 They also pleaded that the single largest party/grouping under Nitish Kumar be called to try and form the government on the basis of an earlier judgment of the apex court.

 The bench heard advocate Viplav Sharma, another petitioner, who is seeking a stay on the electoral process in the state. 

 Sharma wants the apex court to issue a directive to the Election Commission restraining it from announcing the election schedule and issuing a notification.

 Once the notification is issued by the poll panel, no court of law can interfere with it, Sharma pointed out.

 He argued that an interim stay restraining the poll panel should be ordered lest, it would be too late in the day to stop the electoral process.

 Citing the S.R. Bommai judgment, he said: The court, in appropriate cases, will not only be justified in preventing the holding of fresh elections but would be duty-bound to do so by granting suitable interim relief to make effective the constitutional remedy of judicial review and to prevent the emasculation of the Constitution.

 Sharma argued that the presidential proclamation was null and void and unconstitutional and if this position is upheld in court, then the dissolved Assembly would get revived. In that case, any effort by the EC to conduct elections should be stopped now.

 Regarding the withdrawal of notices issued to the governor, attorney-general Milon Banerjee and the Union governments senior counsel, Gopal Subramanian, concurred with the court.

 Subramanian, however, added that the Centre would give a befitting reply to the application seeking to restrain the Election Commission from issuing the notification.

 The court said though no notice shall be issued to the governor, the Centre should give its response to the court on restraining the Election Commission from issuing any notification.

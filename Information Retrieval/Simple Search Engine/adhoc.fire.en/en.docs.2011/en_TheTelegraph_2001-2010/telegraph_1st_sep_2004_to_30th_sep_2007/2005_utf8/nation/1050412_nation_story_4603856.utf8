 Calcutta, April 11: A physically challenged passenger had a brush with death on the Howrah-bound Kalka Mail after he nearly slipped through a wide gap between two vestibules of the train?s air-conditioned compartments. The footplate connecting the two vestibules was missing.

 Prithi Pal Singh Chopra, his wife Balwant and son Karan were travelling from Kalka to Howrah on April 8 in AS-1. 

 Around 7.30 pm, when the train was approaching Mirzapur station, Prithi Pal, who had lost his right arm, and Karan went towards the pantry car to get some snacks.

 As they were moving from coach AS-2 to AS-3, disaster struck. ?My father stepped into the vestibule between the two coaches and found to his horror that the footplate was missing. One of his legs slipped through the open space and he almost fell through it before I pulled him up,? Karan recounted after reaching Calcutta. 

 ?He was luckily saved. We are yet to overcome the shock. It was a death trap and any person could have slipped through such a wide gap,? he added.

 They immediately brought it to the notice of the travelling ticket examiner (TTE). The TTE admitted that the footplate was missing. 

 ?The TTE told me that the foot plate was missing since New Delhi station where the two coaches were attached. He said he could do nothing as the authorities at New Delhi were responsible,? Karan said. ?The TTE said his duty was to check tickets and refused to get the door between the two compartments shut as he had to go to other coaches to check tickets.?

 Other train staff and passengers were also using the vestibule risking their lives on the high-speed train. Karan alleged that till Howrah, neither was a footplate fitted nor were the doors shut. 

 ?The TTE said the coach was supposed to be replaced at Mughalsarai but it was not replaced,? he said. 

 The family lodged a complaint with the railway authorities. 

 Railway officials said they would investigate into the issue.

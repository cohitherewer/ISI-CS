 Indian soldier dies in Congo

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: An Indian soldier serving with the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of Congo was killed when rebel militia fired a rocket into a camp of the peacekeepers during a sweep against rebel militia.

 Naib Subedar Ram Kirpal Singh of the 9 Guards regiment was the second Indian soldier to be killed in the African nation where the army of the provisional government, the FARDC, is being backed by UN troops to attack tribal militia in eastern Congo.

 In June this year, a stray bullet killed Lance Naik Vishnu Bhagwan Shinde while he was patrolling on a UN vehicle with two others in the North Kivu province.

 The soldiers were caught in a battle between the Congolese army and rebel militia near the border with Rwanda.

 Army sources in Delhi said Singh was in a position occupied by UN forces in North Kivu district when his camp was targeted by an RPG 7 rocket and was fired upon early yesterday morning.

 Singh was killed on the spot and four other Indian soldiers had gunshot wounds. The injured were flown by a helicopter to a hospital in Goma. The sources said the soldiers in hospital were not in danger.

 Three Congolese soldiers were also killed. 

 A day earlier, UN forces of the Nepalese and Bangladeshi contingents were attacked and nine soldiers were reported to have been killed.

 The week-long sweep by the FARDC is supported by UN peacekeeping forces that also include Indian Air Force helicopter gunships in addition to infantry troops.

 The UN mission in Congo that goes by the French acronym Monuc is the largest peacekeeping force deployed by the world body and has some 18,000-plus troops. About 20 soldiers have been killed serving for the UN in the country so far this year.

 The attack on the UN position was reported around 8 in the morning today (5.30 am in Congo).

 The account received here says about 3,500 troops of the FARDC backed by around 600 UN peacekeepers are on an offensive against militia of the Ugandan Allied Democratic Forces. The militia has defied a UN ultimatum to hold talks on voluntary repatriation of refugees.

 Earlier this year, the troop presence in Congo was increased under a UN chapter VII mandate that authorises military intervention for peace enforcement.

 North of Congo, Indian forces with the UN are currently in the middle of a face-off between the Eritrean and Ethiopian armies. 

 Army sources in Delhi said the Indian troops on the Ethiopia-Eritrea border have withdrawn to locations where they cannot be immediately targeted.

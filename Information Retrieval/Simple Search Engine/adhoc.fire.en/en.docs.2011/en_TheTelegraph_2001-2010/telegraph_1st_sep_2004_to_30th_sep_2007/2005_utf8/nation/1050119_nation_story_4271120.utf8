 Bangalore blow to Jaya 

 R.VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: The 

 Supreme Court today dismissed Jayalalithaa?s last plea not 

 to shift the trial in an unaccounted wealth case to a special 

 court in Bangalore.

 A five-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti, said no ground was found in her petition to uphold the plea.

 In a last-ditch effort, Jayalalithaa had brought a ?curative petition? to the court, pleading that its earlier judgment transferring the trial to Bangalore and its subsequent rejection of her plea to review the verdict should be ?cured? as it had defects.

 Curative petition is a concept that was put to practice in the Supreme Court by Justice S.P. Bharucha when he was chief justice a couple of years ago. It allows a judgment to be ?cured? if it is established that defects had crept in due to various factors.

 A senior counsel has to vet such a petition before it is filed. Jayalalithaa?s senior counsel K.K. Venugopal had gone through her petition. 

 The bench took up the matter in the chamber and met again close to five in the evening. Since no defects were found in the earlier judgment, the bench held that there was no need for a ?cure?.

 Jayalalithaa had pleaded that the ?atmosphere? in Banglaore was ?surcharged? and ?hostile? due to the Cauvery water dispute and that Karnataka would not lend itself to ?the kind of tranquillity and calm as required for a fair and free trial?.

 She had suggested that the trial be transferred to any other neighbouring state like Andhra Pradesh, Kerala or the Union territory of Pondicherry.

 All the case material ? voluminous documents with English translations of Tamil originals ? have already been ferried to the Bangalore special court in trucks and trains.

 Had the Supreme Court issued notices today, the trial in the Bangalore court would have been stayed to hear the petition.

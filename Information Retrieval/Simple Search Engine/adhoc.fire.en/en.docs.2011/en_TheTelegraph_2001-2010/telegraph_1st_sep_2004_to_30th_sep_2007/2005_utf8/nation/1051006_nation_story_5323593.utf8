 Delhi takes note of Sindh

 PRANAY SHARMA

 Karachi, Oct. 5: Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh today made Indias first serious bid to include Pakistans Sindh in the peace process.

 Singh, the first Indian foreign minister to visit Karachi in over one-and-a-half decades, told a cross-section of the citys politicians and business leaders of the opportunity that lies ahead in terms of political and financial gains if the current normalisation process continues.

 Singh gave a clear signal that the Indian consulate in Karachi would be reopened by January and the Khokrapar-Munabao rail link would also start by then.

 We are on the threshold of a major expansion in people-to-people and business contacts, he said, adding that the effort to reopen the consulates in Mumbai and Karachi reflects the desire of both governments to facilitate the expansion of such contacts to the fullest extent possible. 

 Singh described the proposed rail link as an important milestone. This will facilitate cooperation between western India and southern Pakistan to a far greater extent than before, he asserted.

 Karachi is poised at the threshold of a great expansion as Pakistan moves to harness its potential as a hub country. 

 It is my belief that the expansion in trade and economic cooperation between India and Pakistan will lead Karachi to an even more successful and qualitatively new stage of its evolution as a trading and commercial capital of Asian and the world, Singh said.

 Politicians and business leaders of Karachi reciprocated the sentiments expressed by the minister, but also raised concerns on whether the opening of the markets would lead to a near takeover of the Pakistan economy by Indian companies and traders.

 They also stressed that the arrangement could only work if India allows Pakistani entrepreneurs freer access to its market by removing all tariff and non-tariff barriers to make economic cooperation more attractive. Singh also visited the Indian consulate building on Fatima Jinnah Road in the posh Clifton area of Karachi.

 Singhs credentials in this part of the world has remained high since his days as high commissioner to Pakistan in the 1970s. He has lots of friends, well-wishers and admirers in Karachi who value his judgement and commitment. 

 On his return to the city after 23 years, Singh tried to use his goodwill to the hilt in convincing the leaders in Karachi that unless they have a stake in the ongoing process, peace between India and Pakistan might not work. 

 During the day, Singh met a host of leaders from the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement ? two major political forces in the province that include Mukhdoom Amin Faheemi, Nabeel Gabol, Muhammad Farooq Sattar and Anwar Alam. 

 Earlier, he also met several intellectuals and opinion-makers, including Sirdar Sherbaz Khan Mazari, Mumtaj Ali Bhutto, Ardeshir Cowasjee and Hussain Haroon.

 Downpour drenches Zee but spares DD

 Calcutta, Dec. 3: The swank sets are in place, so are the anchors and former greats like Kapil Dev for expert analysis. But the rain has left Zee Sports with a hole in its pocket.

 Two days after the channel dramatically won the satellite rights to the three-Test India-Lanka series ? shelling out Rs 19.5 crore to the cricket board ? not a single ball has been bowled in the first Test.

 National broadcaster Doordarshan, which has the terrestrial rights, however, has no reason to worry.

 We have a no-play-no-money arrangement with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India), so we dont have to pay them anything for the washed-out days, Prasar Bharati CEO K.S. Sarma said.

 Zee Sports officials were mum on the losses but the advertisement rates offer a clue to how much revenue the channel is missing out on.

 Zee is asking for around Rs 48,000 for every 10 seconds, which is quite high. At best it is negotiating at Rs 40,000, said a spokesperson for a national media-buying agency. Considering there are roughly 3,500 seconds of airtime in a Test day, the calculation is easy to make. 

 There might also be special ad packages for boundaries and sixes done by the company, the spokesperson added.

 For Zee, the loss in real terms may not be as heavy as it seems. The short notice ? the channel acquired the rights less than 24 hours before the Tests scheduled start ? means it may have scaled down its revenue projections for the Test.

 With so little time to approach advertisers, Zees revenue projections must be looking at not more than 25 per cent from the first Test, with the remainder coming from the next two Tests, said a media planner.

 A sports channel official termed Zees rates decent for an India-Lanka Test. In comparison, Ten Sports is reportedly selling airtime for the Tests against Pakistan in January 2006 at Rs 65,000 per 10 seconds, while Indo-Pak ODIs have seen rates climb to as much as Rs 2.5 lakh per 10 seconds in the past.

 Doordarshan was supposed to make a formal appeal before Delhi High Court on Friday pointing out that the previous BCCI regime had awarded it both the terrestrial and satellite rights for the Lanka Test series.

 But we met Sharad Pawar on Thursday night and sorted things out. We are happy with the terrestrial rights and would not want to pursue the matter in court, the Prasar CEO said.

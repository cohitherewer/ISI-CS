 Natwar amp; team for Shanghai forum

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 1: India has been invited, after years of negotiations, to participate in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit to be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, next week.

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh will lead the delegation to the summit where India has, for the first time, been invited as an observer. 

 President Hu Jintao of China and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as well as the heads of governments of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan ? in central Asia ? are scheduled to participate in the summit to be held between July 4 and 6.

 Pakistan and Iran have also been invited to attend the summit as observers. Delhi has, in the past, made all efforts to block Islamabads entry into the forum and its opposition had even led to the organisers keeping both the South Asian countries out. However, with the improvement in Indo-Pak ties, both nations have now been invited as observers.

 The organisation started in 1996 as an initiative of the Chinese as the Shanghai Five ? with Russia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan as the other members ? for closer cooperation with countries in central Asia. The thrust was then on security, energy and terrorism.

 There has been a rethink in the organisation and an attempt was made to set it up as an alternative to the US in the area. Since 2001 the group, which was renamed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, has included Uzbekistan.

 India has always accorded importance to it and Russia was in favour of Delhi joining the group. However, Beijing ? apprehensive of being isolated in the forum by Delhi and Moscow ? had asserted that Pakistan should be taken in if India is made a member.

 Inexperience whiff in Cong inaction

 - Apolitical trio on top, party fails to respond fast on 84 riots report

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: With one action-taken report, the Congress leadership under Sonia Gandhi almost squandered the goodwill it had earned in the Sikh community when it made Manmohan Singh the Prime Minister last year. 

 It took Sonia, Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil, the trio often seen in party circles as apolitical, two days to appreciate that in the affairs of governance, issues ought to be addressed not just in legal and bureaucratic terms but also in their political context.

 The governments action-taken report on the G.T. Nanavati Commissions inquiry into the 1984 riots came across as a document that failed to capture the enduring sentiments among Sikhs about the violence that followed Indira Gandhis assassination 21 years ago. 

 The ATR saw no reason to take even political action against Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar, the two Delhi Congress leaders widely accused of involvement in the 84 riots, although the commission named them. 

 Soon after Patil presented the ATR in Parliament on Monday, the Congress ruled out Tytlers resignation and said the commissions observations regarding individual leaders were not actionable.

 The embarrassment the politically insensitive ATR caused the party leadership was as complete as the eventual turnaround, with the Prime Minister today offering an apology to the community. Tytler was eased out of the ministry last night and Kumar divested of his chairmanship in a Delhi government-controlled board today.

 Although Sonia has not spoken about the developments either in Parliament or outside, she might well be having second thoughts over the government set-up she put in place 15 months ago. Once again, the question being asked in party circles is whether the Congress president was wise in keeping her more experienced colleagues like Pranab Mukherjee and Arjun Singh out of politically sensitive portfolios. 

 Party leaders and members of Parliament believe the trio had not bothered to consult the rank and file in Punjab and Delhi while finalising the ATR. 

 They had six months time to do so after the Nanavati Commission submitted its report in February. But I understand that there was no political consultation at any level while preparing the ATR, said a Delhi Congress leader who met Sonia on Tuesday to urge her to rethink.

 Quite a number of Sikh leaders met Sonia that day to tell her the party should either make quick amends or be prepared to get alienated from the community once again.

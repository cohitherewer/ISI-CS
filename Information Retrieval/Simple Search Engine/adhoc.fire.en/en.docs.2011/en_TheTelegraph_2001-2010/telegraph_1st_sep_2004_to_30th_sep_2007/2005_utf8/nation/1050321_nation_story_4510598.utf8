 Jungle lessons in search of big cat

 Patna, March 20: The big cat did not show up but that did not dampen the spirits of a group of city children keen to learn the secrets of the jungle.

 The team, comprising 35 students from Tarumitra, their teachers, a senior environmentalist and a group of NCC cadets, visited Valmikinagar Tiger Reserve in north Bihar earlier this month. It missed the elusive tiger but returned with pugmarks moulded in plaster of Paris.

 The team left on March 4 and returned on the eighth.

 ?We see tigers as the beginning of a series of ecological relationships. The tiger guards the forest, which in turn supplies fresh water to us,? said Ankita, a student of Patna International School.

 ?We spotted the pugmarks of a tiger right on the banks of the Gandak?thank god, some kids were scared of facing a tiger. We studied the marks with the help of our guides, who helped us make a mould to be taken back to our centre,? she added.

 ?Why do we think of going to distant places when we have such an exotic location in our own Bihar?? asked Sumitra, a Tarumitra volunteer.

 The students went on the tiger trail under the supervision of veteran environmentalist Samir Sinha of Wildlife Trust of India and conducted an on-the-spot study of the forest. They returned with samples of fauna and flora and saplings of some rare trees to be planted at the Tarumitra bio-reserve.

 The children were guided by Sinha and some forest officials, who taught the Tarumitra members how to identify pugmarks of wild animals, including those of the tiger.

 A recent survey revealed that there are less than two dozen tigers in the reserve. 

 Valmikinagar used to have over a thousand varieties of trees before rampant felling shrunk the core area of the forest. The place, known as a haven for kidnappers and dacoits, is limping back to normalcy thanks to the efforts of forest officials and police, Sinha said.

 National Cadet Corps officer Shravan Kumar, who accompanied the students along with a team of NCC cadets, feels that Valmikinagar can emerge as a eco-tourism centre.

 ?The forest is pristine and the tourism department has some good places to stay in,? he said, adding, ?the reports that Valmikinagar is a safe haven for criminals are false. True, it is the last good forest in the state?but it can be protected if the students show that they are concerned over its future.?

 Robert Athickal, the force behind Tarumitra, said: ?The trip to Valmikinagar was part of a campaign spearheaded by environmentalist Bittu Sahgal, who works for a magazine published out of Mumbai, to protect tigers. It is also part of our national campaign to sensitise students on the problems of bio-diversity.?

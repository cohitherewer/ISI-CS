 Top post for Bengal Speaker 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee has delivered what he assured Hashim Abdul Halim ? a big win in the contest for the top post in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.

 Halim, the Bengal Speaker, romped home with 188 votes in the straight contest for the post of chairman of the associations executive committee. Geoffrey Henry of Cook Islands got 73 votes in the election held today, the concluding day of the 51st conference of the association in Fijis Nadi city.

 Pakistan may be usually loath to back India in international fora, but official indications from Nadi suggested that the Bengal Speaker had been supported by presiding officers from Pakistan and Bangladesh.

 Chatterjee, who was instrumental in pushing Halims candidature, has been campaigning for the Bengal Speaker for more than six months. Chatterjee, who addressed the concluding days proceedings after the election, made it a point to thank foreign minister K. Natwar Singh for the canvassing done by his ministry and foreign missions for Halim, according to a statement issued by the Lok Sabha Speakers office.

 Halim played up Indias democracy when he addressed presiding officers from the Commonwealth countries before the vote.

 We belong to the largest democracy of the world. It helps us understand the complexities (of democracy) across the world better. Sharing and caring ? the spirit of the Commonwealth ? is the essence of our democracy. We want that spirit to flourish without any barriers. Hence my candidature, Halim said just before he delegates gave him an overwhelming victory.

 The conference unanimously elected Chatterjee as the vice-president as India has offered to host the 53rd conference of the association in 2007. As Nigeria will host the 52nd conference next year, the presidentship will be held by it.

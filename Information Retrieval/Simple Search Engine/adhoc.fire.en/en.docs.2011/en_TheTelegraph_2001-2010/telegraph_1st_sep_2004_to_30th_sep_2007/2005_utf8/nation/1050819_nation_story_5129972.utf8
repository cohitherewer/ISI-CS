The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Veiled campaign for votes after fatwa

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Aug. 18: The veils have come on after the not-so-veiled order.

 Muslim women candidates slipped on their burqas before hitting the campaign trail for the village polls in Uttar Pradesh, a day after the Dar-ul Uloom seminary ruled they should not contest elections and if they do, must do it under veil.

 I dont mind campaigning with burqa on, said Nur Alam, a 45-year-old housewife who is contesting from Shamli. But I must campaign.

 Nur is one of the many who have decided to go by yesterdays fatwa that the Deoband religious school issued in the interest of society.

 In Borena block of Muzaffarnagar district in western Uttar Pradesh, where a large number of Muslim women are in fray, Rubi Khan was told by her community leaders to put on her burqa before she left home to campaign in Goela village. I have been to the village earlier as a social worker to study health facilities. This time when I went to campaign, I was told by the elders to abide by the Deoband fatwa. I had to do it, said the 22-year-old.

 In Borena alone, 12 Muslim women are contesting the panchayat polls. Some of these candidates decided to send their relatives or husbands to campaign for them after the fatwa. But those who are more aggressive have begun moving with burqa on asking for votes, said Musirul Rahaman, a village elder.

 The fatwa came a day after the Supreme Court took note of a parallel Muslim judicial system allegedly striking root in the country and issued notices to the Centre, the Deoband school, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and several states where Muslim courts apparently exist.

 A spokesman for the Islamic seminary told The Telegraph that Muslim women were first housewives with dignity and dedication for their families and in politics they would not be immune from ugly public glare as their rivals could heap indignity on them. The purdah will protect them from these hazards, he added.

 Several members of the Muslim law board, however, said women would ultimately suffer if they retreat from politics.

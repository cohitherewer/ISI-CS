 MLAs knock on SC door

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 31: Four former Bihar MLAs today joined issue on the dissolution of the House by challenging the move in the Supreme Court. 

 They moved a petition accusing the UPA government at the Centre of subverting democracy at the instance of RJD chief and railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav in order to prevent Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal (United) from forming a government. 

 The four MLAs ? Rameshwar Prasad Chaurasia (BJP), Kishore Kumar Munna (Independent), Rampravesh Rai (Dal (U)) and Anil Kumar (the breakaway LJP) ? contended that the governors report of horse-trading was a baseless allegation and the dissolution of the House was unconstitutional. 

 The counsel for the petitioners, Maninder Singh, said a split in a political party is an accepted political norm, constitutionally guaranteed, and that 22 of the 29 LJP MLAs had actually moved away and agreed to merge their lot with the Dal (U), led by Nitish Kumar.

 When it became evident on the evening of May 22 that the majority was veering around an NDA government, a decision was taken at midnight to recommend the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly, the petition said.

 Dissolution of the Assembly within 79 days of its creation without holding any meaningful efforts to explore the possibility of a formation of a popular government itself is unconstitutional, the petition argued.

 This petition might be tagged on with one filed yesterday and heard together by the vacation bench on June 6 or by the regular bench in July.

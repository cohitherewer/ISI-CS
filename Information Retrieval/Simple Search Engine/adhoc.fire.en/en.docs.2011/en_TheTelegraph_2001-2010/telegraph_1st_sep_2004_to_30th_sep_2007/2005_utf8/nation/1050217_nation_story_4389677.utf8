 Unsafe pills? Let Indians pop ?em

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: Several drugs pulled out of markets in the West because of their adverse health effects continue to be sold freely in India.

 Cox-2 inhibitors, a higher group of painkillers, may soon join the blacklist as the US Food and Drug Administration today began to discuss their safety.

 The move was prompted by three prematurely concluded studies, published by the New England Journal of Medicine, that found the Cox-2 group raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes and other health hazards.

 Merck and Company has already pulled out Rofecoxib, a popular brand of Cox-2 inhibitor, from across the US following adverse reports.

 In India, however, relevant product-safety data on Cox-2 inhibitors were only recently sought from drug companies by the National Pharmacovigilance Advisory Committee, which the Union health ministry had set up to act as an FDA-like watchdog.

 Unlike in the US, hundreds of new medicine brands hit the market in India with most not submitting to the Drug Control Directorate a mandatory post-marketing surveillance data on adverse drug reaction (ADR).

 The authorities consequently have to depend on international agencies like the FDA to issue warnings on drugs.

 ?In our country, most drugs withdrawn or banned in the international market continue to enjoy patronage. It is time we put an end to it,? said respiratory disease expert Susovan Haldar, who has been campaigning against ADR drugs.

 Health department officials said that up to 15 per cent of admissions in hospitals in India involve victims of side-effects and toxicity of medicines.

 Doctors in Calcutta acknowledged increasing drug reaction among patients taking overdose of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-convulsants, analgesics, sedatives, steroids, anti-diarrhoea and anti-bacterial medicines, purgatives and antibiotics.

 ?What worries us most is the increasing cases of fixed drug reaction (for instance, an eruption in one localised area of the body) in Calcutta these days. Over-the-counter use of drugs must be stopped at once,? skin specialist Subrata Malakar said.

 Ashwani Kumar, the country?s drug controller-general, told The Telegraph from Delhi that the onus to report newer drug reactions lay on doctors and local healthcare agencies. 

 ?We, on our part, will do whatever we can to ensure that all Indians get the right medicines,? he said.

 The Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association has urged the state to order a clampdown on such drugs.

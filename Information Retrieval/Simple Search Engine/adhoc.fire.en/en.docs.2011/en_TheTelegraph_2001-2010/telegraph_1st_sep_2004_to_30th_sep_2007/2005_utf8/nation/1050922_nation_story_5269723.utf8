 Anjali skips court 

 Bangalore, Sept. 21: Flying Officer Anjali Gupta did not show up at the court of inquiry headed by Air Marshal Padma Bandopadhyay today. 

 The new court was to probe the charges of sexual harassment levelled by Gupta against three senior officers of the Indian Air Force, reports our special correspondent.

 The five-member court, including Squadron Leaders Anupama Joshi and Priya Sehgal and Hemalatha Mahishi of the Karnataka State Commission for Women, waited all day for her at the Command Hospital. 

 An IAF spokesperson later said Anjali has been given another chance to appear before the court of inquiry and make a statement.

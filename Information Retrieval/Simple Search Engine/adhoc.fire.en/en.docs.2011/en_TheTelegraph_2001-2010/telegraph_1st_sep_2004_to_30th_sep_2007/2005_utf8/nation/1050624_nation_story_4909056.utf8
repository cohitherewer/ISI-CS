 Left warns of tough ride for steel giant

 Posco chairman Lee Ku-taek: Export row

 Bhubaneswar, June 23: The Orissa Opposition, led by the Left, has lined up a rocky welcome for the proposed Posco steel plant at Paradip.

 The 12-mt (million tonne) steel plant, which has brought India its biggest ever foreign direct investment of $12 billion (Rs 52,000 crore), could find itself hamstrung by controversies over rehabilitation and a shortage of power.

 The Opposition, which has been protesting against yesterdays MoU that awarded the South Korean steel major the right to export 30 per cent of the ore it mines, has called for a convention of mining experts and economists to protest against the deal. The meeting will be held in the second week of July, CPM leader Janardan Pati said.

 The state Congress, however, is in two minds about opposing the Posco deal.

 Pati suggested that Posco will face problems over rehabilitation of those its project will displace in the Kujang area of Paradip.

 Last month, there was a violent rally in Kalinga Nagar, Jajpur, with protesters demanding adequate compensation from a company that was setting up a much smaller steel plant in the area.

 Poscos only motive is to make profits. Its promise of 13,000 direct employment is a hoax; it cant provide more than 5,000 jobs, the CPM leader said.

 Questions are being raised on whether the plant will get enough electricity. Although the company plans to put up a captive power plant, it may face a shortage of coal. Nalco and Rourkela Steel Plant have been forced to slash production because of short supply of coal.

 Posco, however, yesterday tried to douse the controversy over its right to export ore from Orissa by pointing to the poor quality of the mineral.

 It said that if it were possible to make quality steel solely with ore from its captive mines in the state, the company would have used all of it instead of exporting some.

 However, the company needs to import better quality ore from Brazil and blend it with the ore mined in Orissa to be able to make good steel. It would be exporting only an equivalent amount of ore, the head of the companys India project, Jeong Tae-hyun, said.

 Jeong was immediately asked how Posco found the ore so inferior when other steel-makers considered it of the best quality.

 All that glitters is not gold, Jeong said. Likewise, in steel, all steel is not the same. I respect Indian steel, but it is different from ours.

 He explained that Posco needs ore whose alumina content is less than 1.2 per cent whereas the ore in Orissa contains 2.4 per cent to 3.4 per cent alumina. The imported ore will cost 60 per cent more, the official said, pushing production cost up by 20 per cent, but it cant be helped.

 Keshubhai stirs fresh revolt 

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 7 (PTI): Dissidence in the BJPs Gujarat unit resurfaced today with three senior leaders deciding to step down from an election committee.

 Former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, former Union minister Kashiram Rana and former state party chief Rajendrasinh Rana ? all known baiters of chief minister Narendra Modi ? said they were unhappy because there were no capable or real leaders in the 14-member panel formed yesterday to oversee local elections. Modi is on the committee.

 In a letter to state party president Vaju Vala, Patel also expressed displeasure at not being consulted before the panel was formed. He has been leading a campaign in the party for Modis ouster.

 I got to know of my inclusion in the committee from mediapersons and later through a letter from the party, the letter said.

 The BJP used to be a party where decisions used to be taken through collective thinking and by involving everybody? 

 The first local election coming up is that of the Ahmedabad municipal council on October 13.

 Party spokesperson Purshottam Rupala denied receiving any letter from the leaders. 

 I have not yet got any letter in this regard from either of the three leaders. I have come to know of it through media reports and I am yet to get a confirmation.

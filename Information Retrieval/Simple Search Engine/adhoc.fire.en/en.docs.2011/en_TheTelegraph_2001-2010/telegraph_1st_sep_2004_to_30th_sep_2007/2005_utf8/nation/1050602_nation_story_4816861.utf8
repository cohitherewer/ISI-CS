The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bofors booms on both sides

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 1: Buried, maybe, but rest in peace? How can it?

 A day after Delhi High Court virtually brought the curtains down on the Bofors payoff case, the controversy that unseated Rajiv Gandhi in 1989 refused to die down as the Opposition and the ruling Congress traded accusations of manipulation and unsubstantiated allegations.

 While the BJP and former defence minister George Fernandes today accused the government of manipulating the CBI, the Congress said it would demand an apology from all those who had launched an unsubstantiated and baseless campaign against the late Prime Minister.

 V.P. Singh, who resigned from Rajiv Gandhis cabinet after the scandal broke and later went on to become Prime Minister, Union ministers Laloo Prasad Yadav and S. Jaipal Reddy ? a former Opposition leader now with the Congress ? and the governments current Left allies were among those behind the campaign.

 They spent Rs 250 crore for political vendetta against a single person, who was an exceptional leader of India, Congress spokesperson Jayanti Natarajan said.

 The party, she told reporters, has called upon all those with a shred of morality and decency, but who were behind the campaign, to apologise to the nation. 

 We are leaving none, she added, asked if this included Singh, Reddy, Laloo Prasad and the Left leaders.

 They have deliberately misled an entire nation, something that cannot be condoned by any democracy. They raked up a campaign against Rajiv Gandhi without a scrap of evidence, Natarajan said.

 Asked whether the Congress was in favour of an appeal in the Supreme Court, she said: ?We believe law should take its course.

 On the other side of the fence, BJP leader Arun Jaitley and Fernandes, who heads the Janata Dal (United), slammed the government for pressurising the CBI to bury the case.

 Jaitley said the acquittal of the Hinduja brothers was a glaring example of judicial burial of a corruption case. 

 The ruling, he added, was an unfortunate end catalysed by collusion between an investigative agency pressurised by the political executive, and the powerful accused in the case.

 This is not a judgment on merits. It does not hold that kickbacks were not paid. It proceeds on a mere premise that documents proving bribery and kickbacks were contained in certified copies, the former Union minister said.

 Yesterday, Justice R.S. Sodhi had said no case can be proceeded against the Hindujas or the Bofors company in the absence of original documents and that the CBI had produced only uncertified photocopies.

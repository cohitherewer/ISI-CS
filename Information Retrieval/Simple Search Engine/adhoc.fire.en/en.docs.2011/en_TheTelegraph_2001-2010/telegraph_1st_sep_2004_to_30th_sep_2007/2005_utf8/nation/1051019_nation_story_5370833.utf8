 Delhi team on J amp;K recce

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Centre is rushing a high-level team under Union home secretary V.K. Duggal to Kashmir to reassess security arrangements following state education minister Ghulam Nabi Lones assassination today.

 The militants broke into the high-security zone at Tulsi Bagh and shot the minister and four others dead. 

 The attack has come at a time Jammu and Kashmir is struggling to cope with the destruction caused by the October 8 earthquake. 

 Duggal, who is to leave tomorrow, will also take stock of the relief efforts. The decision to rush the team to Kashmir was arrived at after a meeting between Union home minister Shivraj Patil, Duggal and E.S.L. Narsimhan, director of the Intelligence Bureau. 

 This (the militant attack) is barbaric and unpardonable?, Duggal said. 

 Sources said Duggal will discuss security for various VIPs, including CPM state secretary Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, whose house was attacked today by one of the militants who targeted Lone. While he was killed by Tarigamis guard, the other militant barged into Lones house next door and shot him. 

 Officials of internal security and intelligence agencies are assessing the change in operation methods of militants. They observed that the militants have been resorting to hit-and-run methods instead of suicide strike. Intelligence agencies also warned that attacks could escalate as the militants want to upset the relief work being done by the army.

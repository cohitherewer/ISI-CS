 Laloo aide differs on Bihar fate

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Plainspeak

 Gaya, April 25: Laloo Prasad Yadav may sound confident of his party?s chances of coming back to power, but his colleague in the Union ministry and senior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh thinks otherwise.

 While the party president has been claiming that the formation of a Rabri Devi-led ?secular? government in Bihar is only a matter of time and that the ?good old days? will be back soon, Singh feels that fresh elections are the only option left for the RJD.

 Speaking to reporters here yesterday, Singh said the electoral arithmetic does not permit the formation of a government in the state. ?Kaise sarkar banegi bataiye na?. chunao ke siwa koi rasta nahin hain (How can a government be formed? There is no other option but to hold fresh elections),? he said.

 When reminded that his party chief has claimed that the government would be formed in the next six weeks, Singh said, ?Woh kya keh rahen hain woh jaane. Hum aapko keh diye ki chunao hoga (He is talking about what he thinks will happen. But I have told you that elections will be held).?

 Some RJD workers were heard saying that Laloo Prasad?s insistence on Rabri Devi as chief minister has caused immense harm to the party?s interests. 

 They felt if the party president comes up with any other name, then the formation of an RJD government will not be a problem.

 Govt walks tightrope on court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: The Centre today reiterated it would bring a bill to restore quotas in private colleges but made it clear it had no intention of getting into a confrontation with the Supreme Court.

 Walking a tightrope between asserting its right to legislate and not offending the judiciary, the government told the Lok Sabha it had no intention of backing off from bringing the proposed legislation.

 Ever since the adoption of the Constitution, the executive, legislature and judiciary have been functioning within the demarcated areas. This goes to the credit of our parliamentary system, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his reply to the discussion on Chief Justice R.C. Lahotis remarks.

 Lahoti had yesterday told the government to shut down all the courts and do whatever it wanted while hearing a petition on reservations for Dalit Christians.

 We are proud to have an independent judiciary which has been assigned the task of interpreting laws and the Constitution. The Centre recognises that proper respect should be shown to judicial pronouncements, Mukherjee said. There has been no confrontation of any kind and there has been no occasion to express anguish on account of any legislative action.

 Last evening, leaders of all parties were unanimous on a bill to counter the Supreme Court order to strike off quotas for scheduled caste/scheduled tribe students in private colleges. This morning, MPs demanded a discussion in the Lok Sabha.

 We recognise that the legislature has to perform its duties to translate into action the programmes of the government. The legislature has enacted laws to carry forward social, economic programmes whenever they have been needed in the interests of the nation, said Mukherjee.

 MPs cited occasions when Parliament had brought laws countering court orders. In 1970, the Supreme Court struck down nationalisation of banks and abolition of privy purses. Parliament adopted an amendment empowering itself to change the Constitution, an MP said.

 Commenting on the stand-off between the judiciary and legislature, Chatterjee said the legislature had its own rights and Parliament as the supreme legislative body would surely act under the Constitution. Similarly, courts had their right to function in their own sphere without any interference.

 There should be a harmonious relationship between major constitutional organs like the legislature and the court, and nothing should be done or said which may create an avoidable controversy, he said.

 Dhoti barb at PMK 

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, April 12: The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), a constituent of the ruling alliance at the Centre, got a drubbing in the Tamil Nadu Assembly tonight over its attempt to project itself as the champion of Tamil language and culture. 

 ?Let your Chinna Aiyah (Anbumani Ramadoss, the Union health minister) first give up his western style of dressing and wear the dhoti,? chief minister Jayalalithaa told a PMK leader trying to raise the issue of Tamil education.

 G.K. Mani, the PMK floor leader, had raised the question of many students passing the matriculation examination without ever being exposed to the Tamil language in school. 

 Irked by Mani?s remarks, even after the treasury benches had explained that ?Scientific Tamil? (nomenclature to avoid legal complications) has been made a compulsory subject up to Class V in all schools, Jayalalithaa hit back. ?You speak as though only your party and its leader, Dr Ramadoss, have love and concern for the Tamil language and heritage,? she said. 

 ?But your Chinna Aiyah (Ramadoss?s son, Anbumani) is seen only in the white man?s attire, suited and booted always, and even addresses press conferences in English,? Jayalalithaa taunted. ?First convince him to switch over to the dhoti.? 

 When Mani insisted there was nothing wrong with Anbumani wearing a suit when he went abroad or to other states, Jayalalithaa said: ?You claim to be the sole protectors of Tamil culture and so people are at a loss when they see your Chinna Aiyah in suit even when he comes to Tamil Nadu.? 

 ?Even the Harvard-educated P. Chidambaram (Union finance minister) is dhoti-clad,? she thundered. 

 ?The late Dravidian leader, Annadurai, used to wear pants. Are you belittling Anna, too?? Mani countered. But Jayalalithaa had the last word. ?Anna wore that only when he went abroad.?

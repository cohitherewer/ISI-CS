 Island of joy in sea of sorrow

 March 17 (Agencies): Rattan Kalsi emerged from the courtroom with a look of shock on his face. The men accused of killing his daughter and 328 other people on Air-India Flight 182 had been acquitted.

 Kalsi, who lives in Ontario, handed reporters a snapshot of his daughter taken before the June 23, 1985, bombing and said the next court for the defendants ? Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri ? would be before God. ?They will be punished later.?

 But Bagri?s ancestral village in Punjab was jubilant. ?As soon as the news spread, all the villagers came to our house with sweets to congratulate us,? said Tirath Singh, his 23-year-old nephew.

 Daughter Inderdeep, who was by the sawmill worker?s side in court, read a short statement that maintained his innocence. 

 Malik?s family issued a similar statement. His aged aunt, Surinder Kaur, the only relative living in their ancestral house in Ferozepur, said: ?Ripudaman cannot be a party to such a ghastly act.?

 More than 70 relatives of the victims had come to Vancouver from around the world for what they hoped would be guilty verdicts. Instead, they found themselves weeping as the British Columbia Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution had not proven its case and it did not believe their key witnesses.

 ?Oh my God, Oh my God,? one of the relatives said to herself as the judge read his not-guilty verdict. Her elderly husband, his eyes welling up with tears, came up to comfort the woman in her wheelchair.

 At a news conference about two hours after the verdict, the families repeated their shock and anger at how the government had handled the investigation and demanded a public inquiry.

 Gutka baron clears lie test 

 New Delhi (PTI): Goa Gutka owner J.M. Joshi, who is facing charges of links with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, has come out clean in a lie detection test conducted by the CBI.

 The polygraphy test report was submitted by the Central Forensic and Scientific Laboratory to the special crimes division of the CBI. It was found that except a ?minor deviation? on one question, Joshi?s replies were correct, highly-placed sources said here.

 The sources said the minor deviation could not prove that the Goa Gutka owner was lying. However, there was some difference of opinion among the CBI officials, the sources said. 

 A section in the probe agency had opined that the case was not going to yield any results as it was registered only on the basis of hearsay by the police, the sources added. 

 The CBI is now contemplating to carry out a brain mapping test on Joshi. He might have to undergo the test at the Central Forensic and Scientific Laboratory in Gandhinagar so that the veracity of his statements could be further checked scientifically, official sources said.

 The brain mapping test is similar to the magnetic resonance imaging during which the functioning of the brain is seen minutely and if a person is lying, certain areas get activated. 

 Jailed Pak youth to go home

 Jammu (PTI): Amir Ali, a 22-year-old 

 student languishing in an Indian jail for over three years, 

 will be among the 48 Pakistanis who will be repatriated 

 soon.

 Ali, who will be reunited with his family on Tuesday, was a third-year engineering student in Sialkot when he strayed into Indian territory and was arrested by the Border Security Force at R.S. Pura in September 2001.

 Ali sentenced to two-years imprisonment, but was lodged at Kotbalwal jail for three years and two months, awaiting repatriation.

 Human rights activist Balraj Puri, who took up the case with the authorities after Ali?s mother and sister wrote to him, said the traumatised youth had become deaf and dumb.

 Jammu and Kashmir High Court had ruled that Ali would stay in jail till a final settlement on his deportation was worked out.

 Puri then met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, wrote to home minister Shivraj Patil and appealed to the state human rights commission for Ali?s release.

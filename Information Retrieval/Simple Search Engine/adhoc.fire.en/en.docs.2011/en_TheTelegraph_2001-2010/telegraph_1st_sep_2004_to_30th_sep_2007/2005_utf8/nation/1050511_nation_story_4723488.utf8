 Raipur SOS to Nagaland police 

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, May 10: They fought insurgency on home turf. Now the home ministry wants policemen from Nagaland and Punjab to take on rebels in Naxalite-affected states.

 The Union home ministry has asked Nagaland and Punjab to spare nearly 3,000 trained commandos following requests from states like Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra for more central police forces. 

 The ministry expects other states to come up with similar requests, especially in view of North Blocks decision to exempt Naxalite-affected states from paying for central forces deployed to fight the rebels.

 But with the Central Reserve Police Force already stretched to the last man, it was getting increasingly difficult for the ministry to juggle security personnel, pulling out forces from one state for deployment in another.

 So when Chhattisgarh police made a request for a battalion of Nagaland police to help them conduct operations against the Naxalites, the ministry was quick to forward the proposal to the Nagaland government. Nagaland has 10 armed battalions, including two India Reserve Battalions. Two more IRBs are being raised.

 Sources said the Centre would ideally like the state government to spare IRB personnel who have undergone a two-year pre-induction training, including a stint with Assam police. 

 Chhattisgarh prefers Nagaland police as they have the experience of conducting operations in densely populated jungles.

 Policemen in Chhattisgarh lack this experience as most of them have been trained for urban policing. The state government also plans to set up a school where state policemen can be trained in jungle warfare.

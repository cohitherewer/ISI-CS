 Bedlam welcome for Jaitley

 Patna, Jan. 21: Barely 10 minutes into his sophisticated election-speak and the BJP?s Bihar poll manager Arun Jaitley today got a taste of what he was up against in ensuring a smooth sail for his party in the state.

 The shock ran as much through his colleagues Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Ravishankar Prasad, C.P. Thakur and state party chief Gopal Narayan Singh, all of whom witnessed the gross indiscipline that has plagued the BJP in Bihar. 

 The 20-odd youths, who stormed Jaitley?s first news conference before the elections, directed their anger towards BJP vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi, who was present on the occasion but too dumbstruck to move during the 15-minute high drama, telecast live by some news channels.

 At the end of it, all that Jaitley could do was to term the incident as ?unfortunate? and an instance of gross indiscipline bordering on ?anti-party? activity.

 Flanked by senior party leaders, Jaitley began talking about the ?misdeeds? of the RJD government in Bihar and how it was certain to be routed in the elections. He was also talking aloud about the UPA being in a shambles with its partners in Delhi fighting for seats in Bihar.

 The lawyer?s arguments were being well received when all hell broke loose. The youths managed to enter the hall at the party?s state headquarters, shouting slogans against Modi and in favour of party leader Janardan Sharma.

 Their problem was the grant of ticket for the Paliganj seat to Usha Vidyarthi despite the ?genuine? claim of Sharma. Disgruntled ticket-seekers have been protesting at the BJP office for the past few weeks but today?s display seemed to be the climax of the process.

 They hurled abuses at Modi and even the woman who is contesting the seat this time. Cajoling, tough words and pleadings by the leaders, most of it by the state president, failed to pacify the young men, who moved menacingly towards Modi. 

 The burly Singh prevented their advance but one of the protesters managed to heckle the Bhagalpur MP.

 Chairs were thrown around, camera operators retreated with their expensive equipment as reporters stood on chairs to witness the chaos. Modi?s police bodyguard tried to intervene but he was shouted down by the youths. 

 The protesters made their point and barked their grievances into the TV cameras before they finally left the room.

 Jaitley reluctantly began his speech and continued with his predictions of the RJD?s ?inevitable defeat?. But angry slogans being raised outside could be heard throughout his address. ?We have too little seats and too many ticket-seekers. But we will not succumb to such pressure. There is no question of replacing our woman candidate from Paliganj,? he said.

 The exercise over, BJP office functionary Harendra Kumar entered into an argument outside and was beaten up black and blue in full public view. The leaders left the office one after the other. 

 An hour later, the Janata Dal (United) released its poll manifesto at a show presided over by Nitish Kumar, promising a ?modern, developed, secular and casteless Bihar? and counting the follies of the 15-year rule of Laloo Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi.

 Anxious times for settlers

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: A couple of days after the Orissa government slapped eviction notices on 1,551 Bangladeshi migrants in Kendrapara district, settlers ? illegal and otherwise ? are spending anxious moments, fearing the worst.

 The government served the notices on Friday, but none seemed to know who were the ?unfortunate? ones and who could stay back in India.

 Sources said anxiety was writ large on the faces of many Bengali-speaking people in Kendrapara. Even the legitimate settlers armed with refugee registration certificates issued by the Union government were jittery and perplexed. 

 The 1,551 Bangladeshi infiltrators on the verge of deportation are from 357 families, who live in 10 villages of Kendrapara?s Mahakalpada block. 

 On Friday, a couple of police officers accompanied by two sections of the state armed police served the notices on 73 Bangladeshi infiltrators in Ramnagar village of Mahakalpada. 

 Sources in the district administration said the Bangaldeshi families who are on the list pleaded their innocence. ?We are Indians who migrated from neighbouring West Bengal in search of bread and butter. It?s almost like sending us to the gallows,? they pleaded. 

 The Kendrapara district administration has beefed up police deployment to thwart possible resistance and disturbances. District collector Hemant Sharma said the administration has constituted special teams comprising revenue and tehsil officials, besides headmasters of local schools, to assist the police in the exercise. 

 The migrants have to leave the country within 30 days or face arrest under Section 3(2)(c), Foreigners? Act, 1946, for deportation. The settlers would be taken into police custody if they fail to leave the country?s geographical territory within the deadline, and later handed over to the Border Security Force for deportation, sources said.

 The Kendrapara collector said the decision to include revenue inspectors and schoolteachers in the exercise was taken as they were involved in the preparation of voters? lists and the issue of photo-identity cards.

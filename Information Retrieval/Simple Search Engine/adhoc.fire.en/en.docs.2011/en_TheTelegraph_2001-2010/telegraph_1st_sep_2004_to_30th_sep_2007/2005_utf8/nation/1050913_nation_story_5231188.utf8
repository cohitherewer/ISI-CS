 Mosques lend ear to noise bar

 - SC order sparks debate 

on morning azaan 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 12: Malegaon, one of Maharashtras communal hotspots, has said yes, but cosmopolitan Mumbais Muslim community wants more time to decide.

 The Supreme Courts order on noise pollution banning use of loudspeakers and any public address system between 10 in the night and 6 in the morning has sparked a debate among Muslims in the city.

 The debate is over whether they should abide by the directive or demand concessions for the pre-dawn azaan or the fajrazaan, which reminds devout Muslims it is time for the first of the five prayers in the day.

 The state police are seeing to it that the order is obeyed and even arrested some people who violated the ban during the Ganesh festival, the 10-day celebrations that began on September 7.

 On Saturday, the All India Ulema Council called a meeting to discuss the directive. We definitely want to abide by the Supreme Court directive. But many of us felt that the morning azaan would not contribute to noise pollution because it is just two minutes long. We would like the apex court to give us a concession, said Maulana Athar Ali, spokesperson for the council, the apex body of imams and maulanas.

 Ali said the meeting, attended by over 300 imams from mosques across Mumbai, was inconclusive and the council decided to call another on September 18.

 There are over 3,000 mosques in Muslim-dominated areas of Mumbai, Thane, and Bhiwandi.

 The morning azaan happens before 6 am only during five months of early sunrise. The rest of the year it happens after 6. Besides being very short, it is not an entertainment-related activity that can disturb other citizens. We would want the apex court to hear our plea, but we will abide by whatever decision it gives, Ali said.

 While Mumbai Muslims debate what to do, their counterparts in communally sensitive Malegaon and the temple town of Nashik, barely 200 km away, have decided to abide by the directive.

 On Friday, Maulana Mufti Mohammed Ismail, of Malegaons Jumma Masjid, called a meeting of maulanas and imams of 180 mosques in the town and decided to stop using loudspeakers for the morning azaan. Malegaons decision inspired the Muslim community in Nashik city to follow suit and perform only a symbolic azaan in low volume.

 On Sunday, religious leaders of mosques in Nashik, led by Imam Sher-e-Khatib of the Jama Masjid, gathered to discuss the issue and decided to abide by the order.

 This countrys laws are for everyone, and everyone should abide by it, the imam said. I spoke to our representatives in Mumbai, and we decided to go soft on this. Though our holiest month of Ramzaan starts after a fortnight from now, we decided not to violate the law.

 Some organisers of Ganesh pandals, however, decided to defy the ban. In Pune, some pandals decided to switch off loudspeakers completely as a mark of protest.

 We met the chief minister, but he told us he is helpless, said Pandurang Jadhav, a member of the committee that oversees Ganesh festival preparations in Mumbai. The state made a plea before the court which was rejected. We want the festival to be over without any hitches. Later, we plan to organise a meeting and discuss what can be done.

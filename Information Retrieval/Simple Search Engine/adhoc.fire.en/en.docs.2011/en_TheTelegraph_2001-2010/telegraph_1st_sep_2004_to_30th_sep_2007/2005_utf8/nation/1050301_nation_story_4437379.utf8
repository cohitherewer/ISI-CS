 MP gets 7 days for entry plea

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 28: Patna High Court today disposed of Mohammad Shahabuddin?s writ challenging the Siwan district magistrate?s order, which debarred him from entering the district for six months, and asked the petitioner to approach the commissioner of Saran division for relief.

 The single-bench of Justice Shivkirti Singh directed the MP?s lawyer, Yaduvansh Giri to file an appeal before the commissioner, within a week. The Saran commissioner will have seven days to give a verdict. 

 Shahabuddin, who came out of Beur Central Jail here on February 24 after Rabri Devi set aside Anil?s order, had also objected in his petition to expressions like ?notorious? used against him.

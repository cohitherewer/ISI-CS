 FIIs can invest in news channels

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: The cabinet has allowed foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to invest up to 26 per cent in news and current affairs channels.

 Till now, only foreign direct investment (FDI) and NRI funds were permitted to be part of the 26 per cent equity. Banks and FIIs were not permitted to make such investments.

 As in case of print media, the overall ceiling on foreign investment remains at 26 per cent but it could be in form of foreign direct investment, OCBs (overseas corporate bodies) or FII, information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy said.

 The entity making portfolio investments in the form of FII/NRI deposits shall not be persons acting in concert with FDI investors, he added.

 Foreign news channels and agencies, which used to be given event-wise approval, will be granted permission up to one year at a time for temporary uplinking.

 Reddy said the cabinet also approved introduction of downlinking guidelines.

 The guidelines will provide better regulation of satellite TV channels uplinked from abroad and downlinked in India, especially to address concerns over content.

 It will also provide a mechanism to check the antecedents and to verify legitimacy of the owners/distributors of the channels being downlinked in India to determine the suitability of the programme being seen by the Indian public, a statement said.

 The approved policy also permits channels to uplink in Ku band through Indian satellites only, subject to the condition that this permission is not used to operate DTH service without proper licence. Currently, all TV channels are permitted only in C band.

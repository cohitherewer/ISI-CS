 Pregnant teenager accuses father of rape

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, April 10: She is fair, tall, large-eyed, 14 and pregnant.

 Noorjehan (not her real name) is a school dropout in Hyderabad who is four months short of becoming a mother and claims that the father is her father, Mohammed Saleem Khan.

 The news became public last week when her mother, Zohra Bi, lodged a police complaint against Saleem after walking out on him along with her two daughters and a son and going to her brother?s.

 Noorjehan, eating a piece of bread inside their two-room accommodation in a slum in the old city?s Chandrayangutta locality, looks bewildered.

 Asked about the baby, the teenager, dressed in a brown salwar-kameez, said: ?Mujhe nahi maloom. Mere baba, nahi, nahi, meri mummy bole so karungi (I will do whatever my father, no, no, whatever my mummy tells me to do).?

 Noorjehan didn?t expect life to take the bitter turn when she left school in July because of poverty. She told police that her father, who is around 45, raped her for almost seven months when she stayed at home and her mother, a maid, would be out at work most of the day. ?He threatened to kill me if I told anyone,? the weeping girl said.

 Saleem, a daily-wage earner at a hotel, who was arrested and released on bail yesterday, denied the charges. ?Mai daruwala hoon zaroor. Magar itna kameena nahi ki beti ke sath aisa karoon (I may be a drunkard but I am not so wicked to do such a thing to my daughter),? he said.

 Whatever the truth, the five-month-old foetus is a cause for concern for both Noorjehan and her mother, and social workers and philanthropists who are pouring into her house with some money and medicines.

 ?I don?t want the baby,? the girl said. ?How can I look after it when I don?t have any money? My mummy and papa don?t have sufficient money to even feed us.?

 Well-wishers are advising an abortion, which is not permitted by law after the fifth month of pregnancy. The safe medical limit is two to three months.

 ?Allah should guide us. I can?t take responsibility for a granddaughter now,? Zohra Bi said.

 ?It is inhuman to expect a 14-year-old to become a mother and bring up the child. Both mother and child will have health and mental problems,? cautioned Dr Manjula of the state-run Gandhi Hospital here.

 The police have decided to send Noorjehan for a DNA test on the foetus to verify paternity after Saleem?s denial.

 ?This is a police case. But we still feel the girl deserves better healthcare,? said Dr Roshanara of the state-run Osmania Hospital, whose doctors have assessed the girl?s pregnancy and have taken her under their medical care.

 ?We will know the DNA result in a day or two. We will decide on the criminal side of the case after Tuesday,? said Chandrayangutta police inspector M. Kameshwaran.

 ?But the medical side has to be decided by the doctors. We will not place any hurdles in the way of a small girl. After all, I too have daughters,? he added.

 Tug-of-war in Delhi on screen puff 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Khan: Smoker in life, not on reel

 New Delhi, May 30: Can puff on screen, cant puff on screen? Health says cant, I amp;B says can.

 What say Shahrukh Khan?

 Ahead of World No-Tobacco Day, Anbumani Ramadosss health ministry is pushing hard for a total ban on smoking on screen. But Jaipal Reddys information and broadcasting people are against imposition of any kind, preferring self-regulation instead.

 Something like what happens in Swades, possibly. In that film, the King Khan is gently cajoled by heroine Gayatri Joshi to kick the cancer stick habit. Shahrukh used to smoke unabashedly on screen, but has reformed. Off screen, he continues to be a chain smoker.

 We do not want to restrict artistic freedom and tell directors what they can show and what they cannot. We certainly are against forcing producers to ban smoking in films, an I amp;B official said today.

 Self-regulation, we believe, is best. If the health ministry through its anti-smoking message is able to convince individual directors and actors to avoid smoking on screen, its fine. Our minister is against any kind of force in these matters.

 The official said smoking was integral to the times and ethos projected in films like the recent Hazaroan Khwaishein Aisi, which revolves round the youth culture of the seventies. In Khwaishein, director Sudhir Mishra shows students not only smoking but taking puffs of grass as well, which was a regular feature of university campuses at that time. To cut the smoking out of the film would be robbing it of authenticity, the official explained.

 Since taking over as I amp;B minister, Reddy has consistently opposed such a bar, though he has been all for the ban on tobacco ads on television and in the print media.

 But Ramadoss, a doctor by profession, is quite the opposite. His Pattali Makkal Katchi even carried out a full-fledged protest movement against Tamil superstar Rajnikant, whose tossing a cigarette in the air and neatly catching it between his lips was once a rage in Tamil Nadu. Recently, however, Ramadoss made it a point to personally congratulate Rajnikant for not smoking in his latest film, Chandramukhi, for whatever reason.

 As the battle over smoking on screen rages, the ban on advertising tobacco and tobacco-related products holds.

 60-plus couple rescued in Katchal

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA 

Port Blair, Jan. 12: Two more tsunami survivors 

were rescued from Katchal today.

 Markus Labin, a 65-year-old man and his wife Unaicy, 60, were picked up from Ponda, a cut off village on the badly-hit southern island, and taken to Mildera relief camp. 

 The couple was reportedly found in healthy condition, as they had been living off airdropped rations. The couple?s son-in-law apparently alerted the authorities, and a naval helicopter was sent from the INS Rajput to rescue them. 

 That was the news chief of naval staff Admiral Arun Prakash was met with during a trip to survey the damage and relief operations at Car Nicobar, Katchal, Camorta and Campbell Bay. 

 ?Plenty more remains to be done,? he said, concluding a two-day visit of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands today. 

 The navy would be present for as long as help is required by the unified command on the islands, stressed Prakash. It has already deployed around 6,000 personnel, over 30 ships and 25 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft for the largest peace-time operation undertaken. 

 Prakash visited the damaged defence installations at Car Nicobar and Campbell Bay, and said though minor changes in structures on these bases may take place, ?defence presence must be maintained?. 

 The wreckage along the coastline has hampered relief operations, Prakash observed. ?Nature has played a cruel trick on us. Many beaches have disappeared and jetties have been wrecked.? 

 In many areas, supplies can only be airdropped, which is ?more time consuming and expensive?. However, there are enough helicopters on hand for the task. 

 ?Shifting of terrestrial objects? due to the earthquake and tsunami will call for fresh surveys of the water to ensure ?the harbours are navigationally safe?. 

 A survey of the Port Blair harbour ? where the naval jetty has been considerably damaged ? has already been completed. 

 With supplies in plenty, now the focus will have to shift to rehabilitation, he said. 

 The seawater ?seems abnormal? in southern areas, and with water coming into habitation areas, rehabilitation will have to be planned accordingly. 

 Three more islands ? Little Andaman, Condul and Pillowmillow ? have been completely evacuated. 

 Problems remaining in relief camps, according to the naval chief, are of a comparatively minor nature, with food, water, shelter and medical aid taken care of. 

 At Katchal, he was told that the women are having problems with the kind of clothes supplied, as traditionally they wear lungis, which will shortly be made available. 

 Union minister for tribal affairs K.C. Kyndiah also visited affected areas today. The ministry has earmarked Rs 2 crore for the islands. ?Rehabilitation has to be done in a time frame and that has to be before the monsoon,? he said.

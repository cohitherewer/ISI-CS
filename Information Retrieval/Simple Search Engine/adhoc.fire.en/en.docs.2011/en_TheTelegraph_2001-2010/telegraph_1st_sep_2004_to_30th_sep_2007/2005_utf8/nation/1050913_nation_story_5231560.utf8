 Seven wonders, Dubai style

 - Falcon city of replicas

 TAJ MAHAL 

 GREAT PYRAMIDS 

 GREAT WALL 

 Dubailand, billed as the biggest leisure, entertainment and tourism destination in West Asia, will have within it a city of replicas of the seven wonders of the world, including Taj Mahal, promoters have announced.

 The replicas will be located in the Falcon City of Wonders at a cost of $ 1.5 billion within the 3 billion sq ft Dubailand. Each of the replicas will house different aspects of community living such as apartments, hotels, restaurants and shopping complexes.

 The Falcon City of Wonders will be shaped like a falcon, which is symbolic of the UAEs heritage, and will house replicas of the Taj, the Pyramids, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

 Symbolic depiction of the features of other parts of the world in Dubai was launched with the inauguration earlier this year of the Ibn Batuta Shopping Mall, which houses the Andalusia Court, Egypt Court, Persia Court, India Court and the China Court.

 These are country-themed shopping zones to mirror ancient Arab traveller Ibn Batutas travels through Morocco, Egypt, Persia, India and China. Work on the Falcon City of Wonders is divided into five phases, with the first phase expected to begin by the first quarter of 2006.

 The Falcon City of Wonders is one of the most ambitious projects to come up in the city of Dubai, and will significantly enhance the citys appeal as a tourist hub, said Saeed Al Muntafiq, director-general of the Dubai Development and Investment Authority. 

 By capturing the spirit of ancient civilisations and recreating the architectural marvels of the world, at the same time combining it with modern facilities, the project offers a truly unique experience to visitors.

 It is a community-based project. The replica of Taj Mahal will house luxury hotels and restaurants while the Grand Pyramid of Giza will contain residential flats, offices and retail outlets, and the Babylonian Gardens will comprise luxury apartments, restaurants and coffee shops. 

 The Lighthouse of Alexandria will consist of hotels and retail outlets. Luxury apartments and retail outlets will be the main features of the Eiffel Tower. 

 The Great Wall of China will encircle the Pharaohs Theme Park located within the fun city.

 Indian held for fraud in US

 Houston, July 20 (PTI): An Indian American, who owns several convenience stores in Lafayette and Lake Charles in Louisiana state in the US, has been indicted on federal charges of operating an unlicensed cheque-encashing business.

 Amir P. Dawoodani is also accused of illegal hiring of foreign students, selling stolen liquor and marriage fraud.

 According to the indictment made public this week, he faces charges of not obtaining proper licences for the cheque-encashing businesses at his stores in Lafayette.

 The court records said federal agents are investigating Dawoodani on allegations of hiring foreign students to work at his stores when he knew their immigration status did not allow employment, harbouring illegal immigrants and helping relatives get married to improve their chances of getting US citizenship.

 Alcohol and Tobacco Control agent Ernest Green was quoted as saying by local media that Dawoodanis shop at Ambassador Caffery Boulevard in Lafayette was suspected of selling liquor believed to have been stolen from a nearby supermarket.

 Dawoodani also faces a July 27 hearing on citations of improper conduct for his managers alleged purchase of stolen liquor and lack of invoices for alcohol in the store.

 His brother and two of his cousins, all of whom prosecutors said worked at Dawoodanis stores, are in the country illegally and were arrested earlier this year. Dawoodanis brother, Aziz, is being held on charges of providing false information to obtain a social security number, making a false declaration before a grand jury and obstructing justice.

 His cousin, Karim Salim, is charged with using a fraudulently obtained social security number and marrying a woman he had known for six weeks so that he could stay in the country. A second cousin, Rafique Dawoodani, has also been charged with providing false information to obtain a social security number. He is under investigation for marriage fraud but has not been charged, according to officials.

 US magistrate judge Michael Hill released Amir Dawoodani pending trial but ordered that he be allowed to travel only to his stores in Lafayette and Lake Charles and that he have no contact with government witnesses. Prosecutors had argued that he might flee the country before trial.

 Dawoodani, who came to the US through Canada, is not a legal resident but has been allowed to stay pending a legal challenge of his immigration status.

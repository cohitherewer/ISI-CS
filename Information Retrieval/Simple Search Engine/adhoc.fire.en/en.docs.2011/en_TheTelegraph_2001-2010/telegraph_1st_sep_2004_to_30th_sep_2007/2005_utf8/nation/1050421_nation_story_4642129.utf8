The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cry for arms deal probe

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 20: The CPM today demanded a comprehensive inquiry into a deal, struck during George Fernandes?s tenure as defence minister, to buy specialised infantry weapons for the army contracted by the defence establishment with a South African firm.

 The Telegraph reported yesterday that defence minister Pranab Mukherjee is scrutinising the deal with the South African company, Denel, to buy anti-materiel guns. Mukherjee said in the Rajya Sabha today that he was making inquiries on reports that Denel paid a British agent to procure the minutes of a price negotiation committee meeting in 2003.

 South African investigators are probing why Denel paid Varas Associates Inc $36,59,395 (about Rs 18 crore) to swing the Indian contract for the anti-materiel guns.

 Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat rejected the notice given on the issue by RJD leader Ram Deo Bhandary and said the minister has already begun an inquiry. 

 But the CPM, a key UPA constituent, has grabbed the latest revelations about the deal with Denel to turn the tables on Fernandes. Nilotpal Basu, the CPM leader in the Rajya Sabha, said: ?The government has enough evidence for instituting a comprehensive inquiry into the deal, which compromised national security and breached the security of the defence establishment.?

 The Left leaders were unhappy about the shoddy way in which the Congress-led government handled the Kargil affidavit issue. 

 The government had filed two affidavits in the Supreme Court, the first saying the deals struck when Fernandes was in power were above board. 

 The second affidavit ? filed after an uproar among the UPA allies and murmurs within the Congress ? said more deals are being investigated and promised action against Fernandes if found guilty.

 For the Left, Fernandes?s exoneration in the Kargil case was particularly embarrassing as it had taken the lead in boycotting him every time he rose to make a statement in either House of Parliament.

 Now, with the NDA-Denel link surfacing, the Left sees an opportunity to again turn the heat on its bete noire. 

 ?We condemn the NDA?s role in stalling Parliament proceedings even when the government has yielded to its demand for a debate in the House,? Basu said.

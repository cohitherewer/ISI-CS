 Bhubaneswar, March 4: Orissa finance minister Prafulla Ghadei today presented a zero-deficit budget of Rs 26,567.86 crore for 2005-06 with a proclaimed thrust on social sector development.

 Reiterating the Naveen Patnaik government?s commitment to developing the social sector, Ghadei allocated the highest amount for the school and mass education department ? Rs 1,838.84 crore. While Rs 740.67 crore has been earmarked for health and family welfare, the women and child development department has got Rs 493.56 crore. 

 The ?budget with a human face? was presented ahead of the birth anniversary of Biju Patnaik, also observed as Panchayati Raj Divas.

 Ghadei allocated Rs 426.40 crore for panchayati raj, Rs 540.65 crore for water resources, Rs 34.47 crore for agriculture, Rs 413.89 crore for the works department and Rs 343.47 crore for rural development. 

 The finance minister had good news for schoolchildren. In keeping with the ?humane? theme of the budget, he allocated Rs 82.2 crore for the mid-day meal scheme.

 Ghadei gave the health sector Rs 160.76 crore with focus on the development of primary centres in rural areas. The three medical colleges of the state have received a cumulative allocation of Rs 43.28 crore.

 Orissa has recorded a per capita expenditure on health of Rs 191.85 during the current fiscal, one of the lowest in the country.

 Shedding light on the financial problems of the state, Ghadei said the debt burden of the state stood at Rs 31,634.00 crore till March 2004, a staggering 61 per cent of the gross income. He added that the government had to spend 30.3 per cent of the total revenue receipt in debt services. ?The situation is simply unsustainable,? Ghadei admitted.

 In the three recent fiscals, the minister said, the government has repaid about Rs 2,500 crore for high-interest loans. In 2002-03, the state repaid Rs 474.56 crore while the following year it was Rs 863.79 crore. In the current fiscal, the government has so far repaid Rs 1,153 crore.

 On the issue of fiscal discipline, Ghadei said, ?The Finance Commission has made the enactment of fiscal responsibility legislation a pre-condition for any debt relief. Therefore, the fiscal responsibility bill needs to be passed in the current session.?

 The government has taken several disciplinary measures to bridge the gap between the revenue receipt and expenditure. More needs to be spent on development projects, Ghadei said.

 Despite the stress on the social sector, the Opposition alleged that the budget had nothing for the weaker sections of society.

 In the last budget, Ghadei had laid emphasis on the farm sector with the irrigation department bagging the highest allocation.

 Pak frees 29 in goodwill gesture

 Quetta (AP): Pakistan will deport 29 

 Indians who were arrested for illegally entering the country 

 from neighbouring Iran, an official said. 

 The Indians left Mach, a town near Quetta, by train for Lahore on Sunday to return to India late this week, said Abdur Razzaq Shah, the superintendent of the jail in Mach where the prisoners were held. 

 The Indians were arrested about four months ago along the Iranian border for entering Pakistan without visas, Shah said. 

 Iran is a common route for people from Pakistan and countries such as India and Bangladesh who try to go to Europe in search of better jobs. It is not clear whether the Indians had travelled to Iran through Pakistan.

 Shah said the Indians are being released as a goodwill gesture. Twenty-two other prisoners were freed from the same jail and returned to India last month. 

 Diplomats visit jailed Indians 

 Dhaka (PTI): Two Indian diplomats have 

 visited nine of their countrymen who have been jailed for 

 entering Bangladesh without valid papers, officials said.

 The Indians, now in the eastern Comilla district jail, were arrested on March 11 while making a dais for Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. Her visit to that area to address a gathering was cancelled after the arrests.

 The Indian high commissions first secretary, Niraj Singh, and assistant consular, Z.K. Mukherjee, visited the detainees and also spoke to local government and police officials.

 The nine Indians were reportedly brought to Dhaka by a local leader of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party to prepare the dais for the Prime Ministers address as they are believed to be very good at such tasks.

 They were taken to court soon after the arrest and sent to jail. The hearing on their case for illegal entry into Bangladesh is pending.

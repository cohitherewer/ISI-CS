 Two-child stick, mostly for women

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 17: Several womens organisations and activists in the health sector are up in arms against the two-child norm for panchayat representatives following findings that it is being used to discriminate against Dalits, adivasis and women.

 Nearly half of those removed from panchayat posts under the two-child norm are adivasis or Dalits, though only a small proportion of panchayat members are from these sections, according to a study conducted by the Delhi-based research group Sama.

 The findings of the study conducted in Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh also reveal that in these states one out of every three panchayat member disqualified is a woman.

 Under the two-child norm, initiated by the National Democratic Alliance government, elected representatives at the panchayat level should not have more than two children.

 Such norms always work against the weaker sections of society, said Brinda Karat of the CPMs womens wing, the All-India Democratic Womens Association.

 Such norms are undemocratic. The way to control the countrys population is to improve awareness and increase the availability of healthcare facilities, not by imposing norms which can be used by stronger sections of society to deny weaker sections their democratic rights, said Karat, recently nominated to the Rajya Sabha from Bengal.

 The study, whose findings were released recently, reveals that the two-child norm is more effective in population control in places where health services are considered an integral part of reducing the fertility rate. Wherever womens health issues receive prominence, population control becomes an automatic reality, said Karat.

 The study also links the two-child norm to an increased rate of female infanticide. In the context of the low status of girls and women, the two-child norm disproportionately affects girls and women and violates their right to life and equality, says the study.

 Activists feel the two-child norm and the disincentives proposed are a violation of the 73rd and the 74th constitutional amendments, which seek to strengthen peoples participation in local self-government.

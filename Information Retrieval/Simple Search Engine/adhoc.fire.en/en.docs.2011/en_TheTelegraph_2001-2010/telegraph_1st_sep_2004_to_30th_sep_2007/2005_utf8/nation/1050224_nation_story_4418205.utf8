 Boy ?feat? puts big two on toes

 New Delhi: The President had to issue 

 a denial and the Prime Minister had to call off an appointment 

 ? all because of confusion over a boy?s claim. 

 Saurabh Singh, who hails from Ballia in Uttar Pradesh, had claimed that he had topped a Nasa examination but the American space agency on Wednesday denied the existence of such a test, reports PTI.

 The 17-year-old was also quoted as saying that President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had appeared for the examination long back and stood seventh.

 The President met the boy, along with his parents and school principal, for 15 minutes. However, Kalam?s press secretary said the President ?had never appeared in any such examination of any foreign country?.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was also scheduled to meet Saurabh but cancelled the appointment at the last moment.

 ?I have not been able to confirm that such an examination exists. I have checked all appropriate offices of Nasa and based on our investigation, it can be said that it (examination) does not exist,? Nasa spokesperson Debia Rahn said in Washington.

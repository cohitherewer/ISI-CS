 Karat echoes CM as party watches words

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: Prakash Karat spoke Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees language today, making sure everyone got the message about the CPM speaking in one tongue.

 We are all against dogma. The word dogma comes from religious belief. We are against clinging to beliefs without sense, the general secretary said, echoing the Bengal chief ministers words, expressed in the wake of his recent visit to Singapore and Indonesia.

 The CPM central committee, second after the politburo in decision-making, appears to have problems not with its leaders language, but with their speaking in public too much.

 Sitaram Yechury had said yesterday that the central committee had requested leaders in general to keep their thoughts within party confines and not engage in unrestrained public discourse.

 In recent days, the party, particularly in Bengal, has given the impression of being riven by differences over Bhattacharjees plans to invite Indonesias Salim Group to build an industrial city, which would involve acquiring rural land.

 Karat said there was no such thing as a request to the chief minister to exercise restraint while making public statements. But party sources admitted that a general instruction had gone out.

 Observers said that, If anything, such a directive would help Bhattacharjee, restricting criticism of him and his policies, provided there is any, within the four walls of party forums.

 Bengal land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollas initial opposition to the Salim project had become a matter of public debate, embarrassing the party.

 It is also true, however, that some of the chief ministers statements on his foreign trip created the impression of differences with the partys central leadership.

 One such was his pronouncement that he would welcome 100 per cent private ownership of new airports. He did not say foreign ownership, but that was how it was seen by many.

 Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh does not permit 100 per cent foreign investment, but only 49 per cent.

 Maybe that was why the central committee at its Delhi meeting at the weekend asked all leaders to be ? in Yechurys words ? vigilant while making statements. 

 Karat said the Bengal government was not considering any new airport project. There is no such concrete proposal.

 A second airport is to be built in Calcutta, but the plan is still far from being firmed up.

 Karat said the party was firmly behind Bhattacharjee in his drive to industrialise the state. 

 Land had to be made available, whether in Bengal or elsewhere, for industrialisation. We are not going to give away multi-crop fertile agricultural land. There will be no indiscriminate transfer. But land has to be made available.

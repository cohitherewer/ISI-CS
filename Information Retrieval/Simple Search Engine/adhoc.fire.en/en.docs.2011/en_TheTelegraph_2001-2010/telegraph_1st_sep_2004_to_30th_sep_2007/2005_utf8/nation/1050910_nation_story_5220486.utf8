 India and China set up encounter at Nathu-la

 AMIT UKIL

 Siliguri, Sept. 9: A confrontation between Indian and Chinese soldiers is brewing on the border. 

 The fight will take place minus guns and other weapons, though, when the two sides take on each other in a friendly game of volleyball on September 15 at Nathu-la, 14,500 ft above the sea level!

 This is the first time soldiers from the two sides are meeting for a sporting event in such a manner. The game is part of an ongoing process of confidence-building between the two sides, said a senior officer of 33 Corps, which is stationed across north Bengal and Sikkim.

 The October 2 date for the opening of Nathu-la for trade with China may not be certain, with the Chinese ambassador to India saying that the infrastructure on their side is not ready yet. But the tie will go ahead regardless.

 The Chinese team and officials will visit the venue, which is an open space about 100 metres from the border, two days before the match, the officer said. The visit will not just be a reconnaissance of the spot but can be seen as a bid to acclimatise the players to the rarefied conditions at that height.

 The Chinese team will have a practice session on that day, said the officer. They will be checking out how long they can keep up their stamina at a place where just breathing normally is sometimes a problem.

 The proposal for the game was made by the Indian side during the last biannual flag meeting between the garrison commanders. Once the idea was floated, the Chinese army took just a couple of days to officially agree to the tie. 

 Of course, the decision on Indias part to offer to host such a match took some time to be finalised, as it had to be cleared first by the defence ministry, which then forwarded it to the external affairs department, the officer said.

 The timing of the game was fortuitous, coming as it does between the ongoing Beijing visit of home minister Shivraj Patil and the visit by national security adviser M.K. Narayanan on September 26. Improving India-China relations is clearly the flavour of the month.

 The Indian Army team, which has been picked from personnel in the various units of 17 Mountain Division, is preparing hard for the match. China, after all, is known to have very good volleyball players. 

 The competition is expected to be stiff and, though not drawing as much attention as an international game of cricket or tennis, is keenly awaited.

 SC rebuffs Taj night-view worry

 New Delhi (PTI): The viewing of the Taj 

 on moonlit nights would go on as scheduled with the Supreme 

 Court brushing aside the ?grave concern? expressed over 

 the ?security lapses? by the court commissioner.

 A bench of Justices Ruma Pal, S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia said no orders were required to be passed on an application filed by court commissioner and advocate Krishan Mahajan detailing his apprehensions after a spot inspection of the Taj.

 He stated that there was no system put up by the Archaeological Survey of India to check the identity of a person entering the premises on moonlit nights and that the sophisticated equipment purchased for frisking visitors was lying idle.

 Appearing for the ASI, A.D.N. Rao termed the report a ?red herring? and said all the security measures were in place and that the apex court?s directions were followed in letter and spirit.

 Rao said in the name of establishing visitors? identity, the ASI should not get into a roving inquiry of their background. ?Even when one buys a ticket to board a train or an aeroplane, such inquiries are not done,? he said.

 The bench agreed and said as long as proper physical frisking of the visitors was taking place and they were kept at a safe distance from the monument, there was no danger to the Taj Mahal.

 Brigand statue goes missing

 Chennai: A four-foot-tall statue of Veerappan 

 has disappeared, two days after it was seen at his grave, 

 at Moolakadu near Mettur, reports our special correspondent. 

 ?We found that the statue had been removed early today under 

 mysterious circumstances,? said police sources in Kolathur 

 on Wednesday.

 ?The statue, made of mud and having a striking resemblance to Veerappan, was near his tomb for about two days and had put the locals in a quandary as nobody knew who put it there in the first place,? they added. 

 The land belongs to the public works department and nobody was supposed to erect a statue there as it was part of the Mettur reservoir?s catchment area. 

 Veerappan was buried close to the graves of his relatives, after his family resisted the Special Task Force?s plan to cremate him in October 2004.

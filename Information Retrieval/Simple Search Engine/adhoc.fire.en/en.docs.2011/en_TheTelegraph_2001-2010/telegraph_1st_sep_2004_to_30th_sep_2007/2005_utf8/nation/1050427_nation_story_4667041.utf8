 RJD bristles at Buta

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: Tension appears to be brewing between the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 Bihar governor Buta Singh?s claim today that the Rabri Devi regime functioned on whims and fancies, the CBI special court?s chargesheet against Laloo Prasad Yadav in a fodder scam case and the raids on his party colleague Mohammad Shahabuddin have triggered a strain between the allies.

 The RJD is also unhappy with the Congress for not putting up a fight when BJP members attacked Laloo Prasad in Parliament for two consecutive days. While the RJD and the CPM tried to shout back, the Congress was largely passive.

 Speculation was rife that the RJD has threatened to pull out of the UPA government, but the Congress denied it.

 With the BJP going all out to demand his removal, the RJD chief is livid with Singh, a former Congress leader, for compounding his woes.

 Laloo Prasad?s close confidant and Lok Sabha MP Ram Kripal Yadav trashed the governor?s claim, saying: ?His allegations are false and he should not have levelled them.?

 The governor said on television today: ?The administration (earlier) did not run by any system. It was not run as per the Constitution or rules. The government was being run by whims and fancies.?

 The Congress said Laloo Prasad need not resign just because charges were framed against him. Senior party leader Ambika Soni said: ?There is no need for him to resign. Shibu Soren was asked to quit because there was a non-bailable warrant against him.? 

 For Laloo Prasad, the only comfort came from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who read out the minister?s statement in the Lok Sabha on Thursday?s train accident near Vadodara and the alleged attack on him. When Laloo Prasad read out his speech yesterday, the Opposition created such a din that not a word could be heard.

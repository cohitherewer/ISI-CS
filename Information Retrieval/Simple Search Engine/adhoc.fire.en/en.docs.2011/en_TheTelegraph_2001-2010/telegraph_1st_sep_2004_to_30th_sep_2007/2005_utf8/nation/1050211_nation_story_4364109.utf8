 Junior gets bail, seeks acharya?s blessings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Feb. 10: Junior pontiff Vijayendra Saraswati today prostrated himself at the Kanchi seer?s feet at their first meeting in three months after Madras High Court granted him conditional bail in the temple manager murder.

 The court said the evidence to link Vijayendra to the murder of Varadaraja temple manager Shankar Raman was ?insufficient? and even weaker than that adduced to implicate seer Jayendra Saraswati, who was freed on bail last month.

 ?Prima facie, a doubt should arise regarding the participation of the petitioner (the junior pontiff) as a co-conspirator,? the court said, ending Vijayendra?s 32-day stint in jail.

 All the 24 accused in the murder were, however, summoned by a Kancheepuram court to be handed copies of chargesheets filed against them on January 21. Although the court adjourned proceedings to February 24 ?without assigning any reason?, Vijayendra sought the seer?s blessings and spoke with him for a while.

 While granting Vijayendra bail, high court judge M. Thanikachalam said even if the prosecution?s case that he had got his brother Raghu to ?carry out? the Kanchi seer?s directives was true, charges of criminal conspiracy ?could be decided only after recording of evidences during the trial?.

 ?At present, in the absence of clear materials to prove the meeting of minds between the conspirators, it may not be possible even prima facie to say that this petitioner (Vijayendra) was party to the conspiracy,? the court said.

 The judge waved away the contention that Raghu had written to ICICI Bank, Kancheepuram, to make out a demand draft in favour of M/S Residency Builders for Rs 5 lakh. ?No material has been placed before me at present informing that the company belongs to any one of the accused.?

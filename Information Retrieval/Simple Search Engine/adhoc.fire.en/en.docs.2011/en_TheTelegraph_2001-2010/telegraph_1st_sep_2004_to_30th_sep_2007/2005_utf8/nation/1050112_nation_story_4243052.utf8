 Loss of seat over jail term 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: The Supreme Court today set aside the election of Kerala MLA P. Jayarajan, saying the day he filed his nomination, a trial court had sentenced the CPM leader to more than two years? imprisonment in a criminal case.

 The verdict could have an impact on contestants in the Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana Assembly polls who are facing criminal charges.

 The Election Commission had rejected Jayalalithaa?s nomination papers and the apex court had unseated her from the Tamil Nadu chief minister?s chair in 2001 after she was awarded a two-year jail term in the Tamil Nadu Small Industries land purchase scam case.

 However, Madras High Court later quashed her conviction. She contested a byelection and was sworn in as chief minister after her chosen man Panneer Selvam stepped down from the post. 

 Jayarajan, who was elected from the Kuthuparamba constituency, was not so lucky. He contended that the trial court had awarded him separate sentences, each of them not exceeding a year. Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, disqualifies a person, convicted for two or more years, from contesting elections for a period of six years.

 But the Supreme Court rejected the argument, saying the trial court had ordered the sentences to run consecutively and the cumulative period of imprisonment thus exceeded two years.

 A five-judge full Constitution bench presided by Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and comprising Justices Shivaraj Patil, K.G. Balakrishnan, B.N. Srikrishna and G.P. Mathur said the cumulative period of sentence in a particular case should be taken into consideration by the returning officer at the time of filing nomination.

 This interpretation is likely to have its spin-off in the three states going to polls.

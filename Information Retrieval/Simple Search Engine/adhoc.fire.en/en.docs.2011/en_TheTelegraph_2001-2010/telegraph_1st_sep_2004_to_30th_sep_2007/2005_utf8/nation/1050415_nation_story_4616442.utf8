 Mumbai Express chugs off to protests

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kamal Hassan: Under fire

 Chennai, April 14: Kamal Hassan?s latest film released to protests across Tamil Nadu by activists of a regional party over the use of English in the title.

 In Chennai, nearly 100 workers of the Dalit Panthers of India (DPI) were arrested for trying to storm some cinemas showing Mumbai Express, including Abhirami Theatre, police sources said. They called for the ?boycott of films that degraded Tamil language and tradition?.

 Both the DPI and its ally, the PMK, under the banner of their recently launched ?Tamil Protection Movement?, had been opposed to the use of an English word in the title.

 The actor-filmmaker, who stars in the film with Manisha Koirala, however, refused to change the title.

 Two days ago, PMK chief S. Ramadoss hinted at not pressing the party?s agitation against Mumbai Express. But hundreds of activists of its ally went ahead with the protests.

 Late last night, some goons entered a cinema at suburban Red Hills and tried to damage the screen, police said.

 In the PMK and DPI stronghold of Villupuram district, initial shows were called off in at least two theatres ?under pressure from local DPI men?, said reports reaching here.

 In Pollachi town, 10 DPI men were rounded up as they assembled before a cinema; no major incident was reported in the southern districts, the sources said. Late in 2002, Rajnikant?s Baba had run into similar protests that the PMK spearheaded.

 Rajnikant?s new film, Chandramukhi, that, too, released today ran into trouble at a Madurai theatre where fans ripped the screen unable to watch the heroine, Nayantara, abusing and slapping the hero, police said. Five persons were injured and 20 people booked.

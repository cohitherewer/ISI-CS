 Chargesheet filed against Karunanidhi

 Chennai, May 27 (PTI): Tamil Nadu police have submitted to a city court a chargesheet against former chief minister M. Karunanidhi and his son and former mayor M.K. Stalin in connection with alleged irregularities in the construction of nine flyovers during the DMKs rule in 1996-2001.

 The chargesheet submitted yesterday by the CIDs crime branch also named 13 others, including two former ministers, according to police sources.

 The DMK today dubbed the chargesheet a political vendetta and an attempt to divert peoples attention from the Rs 65-crore disproportionate assets case against chief minister Jayalalithaa. There is nothing in the case. We are prepared to face any situation. We will fight it legally, party chief Karunanidhi said.

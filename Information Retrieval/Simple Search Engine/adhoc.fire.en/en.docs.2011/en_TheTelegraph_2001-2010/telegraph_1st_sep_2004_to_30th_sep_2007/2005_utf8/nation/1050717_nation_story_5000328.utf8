 Congs Laloo bait for Paswan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 16: The Congress is seeking Laloo Prasad Yadavs endorsement for a plan not to announce a chief ministerial candidate for the Bihar Assembly polls.

 The party believes the formula can entice Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan to fight the elections jointly with the United Progressive Alliance despite his allergy to the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief.

 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh is understood to have proposed the formula to Laloo Prasad (in picture) today. Singh said the RJD leader strongly felt that all secular parties must contest the elections together.

 After the last polls, Paswan had offered to support an RJD-led government if the chief minister was going to be anyone outside Laloo Prasads family.

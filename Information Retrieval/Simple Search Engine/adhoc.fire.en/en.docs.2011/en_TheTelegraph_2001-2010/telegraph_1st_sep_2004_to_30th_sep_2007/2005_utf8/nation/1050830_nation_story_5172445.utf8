 Fourth crash in a week

 killed, CM called to delhi 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 29: The dance of death continues in Mumbai. In yet another monsoon-related tragedy, six residents were killed and at least a dozen injured when the 80-year-old Rassiwala building near Liberty cinema collapsed early this morning.

 This is the fourth collapse of an old building in Mumbai in a week and the sixth since the advent of the monsoon in June. The collapse has put a cloud on the credibility of the administration, which has been under fire since the July 26 deluge.

 Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh visited the site of the collapse on Wellington Street this morning and announced that he had ordered the relocation of 900 families still staying in 27 unsafe buildings to transit camps within a week.

 A few hours later, Deshmukh was summoned to Delhi by the Congress leadership, but party sources said it was a scheduled meeting.

 The residents of Rassiwala building were served warning notices by the municipal corporation two weeks ago and advised to the relocate, but the four families residing in the building did not do so.

 Around 12.40 am, the three-storeyed building came down with a loud thud and was enveloped in a thick cloud of dust, eyewitnesses said. Fire brigade personnel reached the site within minutes and helped rescue residents.

 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation commissioner Johny Joseph said: We had served them a notice asking them to move out, but they refused. Besides, it is the Maharashtra Housing and Development Authoritys responsibility to take care of the building.

 However, residents of these buildings said the transit camps lack basic amenities.

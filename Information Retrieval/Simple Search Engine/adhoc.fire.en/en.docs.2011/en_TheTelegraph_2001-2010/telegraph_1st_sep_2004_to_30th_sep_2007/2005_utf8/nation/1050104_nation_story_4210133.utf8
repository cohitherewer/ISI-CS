 Bush in bipartisan appeal for aid

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Jan. 3: President George W. Bush today took a bipartisan initiative to bring together his father, the 41st US President and Bill Clinton his Democratic predecessor, to lead a nationwide campaign to assist Asia?s tsunami victims. 

 He then drove with his father, First Lady Laura Bush and Clinton to the Indian embassy here to sign a book of condolence. ?We pray for the victims of this terrible disaster,? he wrote in the condolence book after his wife placed a bunch of white roses in front of a bust of Mahatma Gandhi at the embassy?s reception area as the group walked in. 

 ?And we stand firmly with the people of India as she recovers?, he wrote. All the four visitors then put their signatures under that statement. 

 Earlier, as Bush and his two predecessors assembled in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, he said: ?I ask every American to contribute as they are able to do so. 

 In the coming days, Presidents Clinton and Bush will ask Americans to donate directly to reliable charities already providing help to tsunami victims. ?I have asked the former Presidents to solicit contributions both large and small,? he said. He urged Americans to donate money, not goods. ?Cash donations are most useful?. 

 Bush was asked at the embassy if he would follow through this drive to the mission with a trip to India. He said: ?When I spoke to the Prime Minister (Manmohan Singh), I assured him that my intentions were to make it this year to India. In the meantime, though, our country stands with the people who have suffered. We want the Indian government, the Indian people to know that we will help in any way we can. 

 ?I have asked President Clinton and President Bush to lead an effort to raise private contributions to go to the families of those who have suffered and to help provide food, medicine, water, shelter, whatever the Indian government thinks is necessary?. 

 He thanked the Indian government for taking a lead in organising Asia-wide tsunami relief. ?One of the first things that we did was to put together a core group of nations, nations that are capable of organising relief efforts around the region, and the Indian government has been especially strong, as a part of this core group.

 ?And I told the ambassador (Ronen Sen) to thank the Prime Minister for his very strong leadership. 

 ?Our navies are coordinating together; our search and rescues are coordinating together. And now the American people and the American government want to help where help is needed,? Bush said.

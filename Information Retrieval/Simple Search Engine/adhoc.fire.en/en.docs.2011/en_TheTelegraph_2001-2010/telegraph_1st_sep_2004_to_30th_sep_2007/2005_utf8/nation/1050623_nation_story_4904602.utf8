 Minister misses Posco date

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, June 22: In the end, the opposition to the Posco deal was as much within as outside.

 While Left workers and those from non-Congress Opposition parties courted arrest before the secretariat ? where the memorandum of understanding was signed at 6 this evening amid fortress-like security ? Orissa industry minister Biswabhusan Harichandan, a senior BJP leader, stayed away.

 Over 200 protesters from four parties ? the CPI, CPM, Janata Dal (S) and the Orissa Gana Parishad ? were taken into custody as they raised slogans against the signing of the MoU for setting up a 12-million-tonne steel plant at Paradip.

 The four parties had announced their decision to agitate against the deal that allows the South Korean steel giant to export 30 per cent of the 600 million tonnes of iron ore allotted to it.

 They said the Naveen Patnaik government has given an opportunity to the company to loot iron ore from the state and the proposal to import the same quantity of high-value ore from Brazil would go against Orissas interests.

 Hundreds of students of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the BJPs students wing, also protested in front of the official residence of the governor.

 But it was the industry minister who was conspicuous by his absence.

 Sources said B.B. Harichandan was miffed at the way the deal was piloted by bureaucrats. 

 The minister, the sources added, was also upset with the way he was treated by some bureaucrats when the high-level Project Clearing Authority of the state government cleared the deal on Saturday.

 When the deal was being signed, the minister was in his official residence. There is no question of happiness and unhappiness. I have nothing to do with it. The government has signed it, Harichandan said.

 The four Opposition parties announced they would continue with the protests.

 Former Union steel minister Dilip Ray said the deal would turn into the biggest mining scandal of the state. While Indian companies use local grade iron ore to produce world-class steel at low cost, why should Posco need blending of local ore with the imported mineral? Ray asked.

 However, the main Opposition party, the Congress, did not know whether to oppose or support the deal.

 State unit chief Jaydev Jena said the party supported the entry of Posco, but added that the company should not be allowed to export iron ore from Orissa.

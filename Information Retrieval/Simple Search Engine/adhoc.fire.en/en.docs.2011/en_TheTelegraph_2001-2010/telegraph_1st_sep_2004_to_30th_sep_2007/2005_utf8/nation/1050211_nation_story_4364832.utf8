 EC heat on Siwan sultan

 OUR BUREAU

 Feb. 10: Siwan is under the scanner, yet again.

 In a bid to ensure free and fair polls, the Election Commission today asked the Bihar government to transfer Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Mohammad Shahabuddin from Siwan jail to a prison in any other part of the state where elections are over.

 The order to transfer Shahabuddin was issued because the Commission was concerned over reports that he was holding meetings with political workers inside Siwan jail. Sources in the poll panel said it was imperative to transfer him from Siwan before the next two phases of polling on February 15 and 23.

 Shahabuddin can be shifted to Beur Central Jail in Patna, the sources added. 

 But even the model Beur jail, where raids last year yielded a mobile phone used by Pappu Yadav, has come under the scanner. The Madhepura MP is also believed to have held meetings with his supporters inside the jail.

 Siwan, known for electoral violence, drew the attention of the poll panel yesterday itself when it ordered the transfer of the district magistrate and superintendent of police of Siwan. 

 Following the directive, C.K. Anil and Ratan Sanjay replaced R.S. Paswan and Jaglal Choudhary as the DM and SP of Siwan respectively.

 Besides, two senior officers have been also been deployed to look after general law and order in Madhepura and five other districts. 

 Sunit Kumar will look after the four districts of Khagaria, Luckisarai, Sheikpura and Munger while Raj Vardhan Sharma is entrusted with the same responsibility for Saharsa and Madhepura.

 In the meantime, the abduction saga continued with unidentified gunmen allegedly kidnapping an Independent candidate of a constituency in Siwan.

 Kamar-ul Haq had just received his symbol to fight the elections from the Raghunathpur Assembly constituency and was returning home yesterday afternoon when three armed men overtook his vehicle on their motorcycle near a railway crossing and took him hostage at gunpoint.

 A case has been registered with Sisawan police station against six persons. Police have reportedly started conducting raids to track down the culprits.

 Police prima facie suspect that the abduction is the handiwork of a rival gang of Haq?s son Ayub Khan, who is himself faces criminal charges.

 Haq?s supporters today took to the streets to protest against the alleged abduction and blocked the Siwan-Sisawan road for hours.

 Shahabuddin is understood to have thrown his weight behind Vikram Kuer, another Independent candidate from Raghunathpur. State Congress legislature party chief Vijay Shankar Dubey too is in the race from there. 

 In Patna, BJP leader Arun Jaitley said, ?The Election Commission?s directive shows that the RJD government is guilty of misusing the state machinery. The government should learn a lesson at least now.?

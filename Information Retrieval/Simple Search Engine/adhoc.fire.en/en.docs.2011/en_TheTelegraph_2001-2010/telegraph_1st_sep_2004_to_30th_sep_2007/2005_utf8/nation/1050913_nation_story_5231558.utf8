 Kiss and cry, in freedom at Wagah

 - civilian prisoners swapped in goodwill move

 Wagah, Sept. 12: Some cried, others knelt down to kiss the soil. And some just kissed faded photographs.

 Handcuffs gave way to garlands and emotions ran high at the border check post here as India and Pakistan swapped nearly 600 civilian prisoners to push their peace process forward.

 My brother is coming back after 11 years, said a woman as she waited on the Indian side of the border.

 With Allahs grace the tears will give way to happiness, said Imtiaz, a Rawalpindi resident, before being hustled into a hall by a police constable for his papers to be verified.

 As many as 587 prisoners, including 371 fishermen, were released today. While Pakistan freed 435 prisoners, India released 152. We are happy to free more prisoners than India. It shows that we care, said Waseem Sajjad, interior minister of Pakistans Punjab province.

 We will not allow innocents to languish in our jails.

 Relatives wiped tears and distributed sweets as the first batch of 64 Indians crossed to freedom. But the tears of hope that welled up in Harjit Kaurs eyes soon rolled down in despair.

 Harjit has been coming to Wagah for the last many years with a framed photograph of her father Joginder Singh, a Border Security Force constable who went missing in 1971. I am told he is alive. Has anyone seen him? she asked.

 There was no response.

 He is alive. He is alive. My heart says so. They must have met him. This photograph is old. But that is all I possess of him, she cried.

 The Pakistani prisoners have promised me they will take my message across, search for my father and send information, she said, wiping the frame. She then kissed the photograph before walking away. 

 Harjit was not the only one who went back disappointed. Relatives of 54 missing prisoners of war believed to be in Pakistani jails since the 1971 war ? and one since the 1965 conflict ? were not allowed to either meet those being released or enter the last 500 metres to the border to see the homecoming of the others.

 They had come with the hope that someone somewhere may have seen their lost ones and tell them how they were.

 There are 54 Indian POWs in Pakistan. We want to know what has happened to them, said B.K. Suri, president of the Faridabad-based Missing Defence Personnel Relatives Association, whose brother Major A.K. Suri had written from Karachi jail to inform the government about the plight of 20 POWs.

 It is difficult to live without knowing the truth, said Simmi Waraich, whose father Major S.P.S. Waraich is believed to have been taken prisoner during the 1971 war.

 Dalbir Kaur, the sister of death row convict Sarabjit Singh, was not allowed to proceed from the outer gates of the check post with his daughters.

 We have come to tie rakhi on the hands of all the prisoners but are not being allowed by the authorities. I will appeal to US President George Bush to get my brother released. I also appeal to President Pervez Musharraf not to delay his release. I hope Prime Minister Manmohan Singh raises the issue with Musharraf when he meets him, she said.

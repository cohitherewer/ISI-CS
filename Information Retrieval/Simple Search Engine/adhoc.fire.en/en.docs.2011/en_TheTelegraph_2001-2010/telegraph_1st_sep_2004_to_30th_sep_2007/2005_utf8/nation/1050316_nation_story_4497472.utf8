The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Sonia in airport ruckus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 15: After Bihar and Jharkhand, it was Andhra Pradesh that created an uproar in both Houses of Parliament today.

 Telugu Desam Party members, joined by those from the BJP, orchestrated a protest against naming the international airport in Hyderabad after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. They also put Congress president Sonia Gandhi in their direct line of fire.

 ?We strongly object to the way a political person ? not connected with the development of this airport ? has been invited to lay the foundation stone for this airport,? Desam MPs said in a memorandum to the Prime Minister.

 Sonia, sitting next to Laloo Prasad Yadav in the front row of the Lok Sabha, appeared amused at the hue and cry. 

 Desam MP K. Yerran Naidu raised the issue during zero hour. ?The new airport should have been renamed after former TDP chief minister N.T. Rama Rao, the pride of the Telugu people,? he said. ?The government?s decision is a great insult to the people of the state.? 

 Backing him, BJP?s deputy leader V.K. Malhotra said the decision to name the airport after Rajiv Gandhi has agitated the people of Andhra.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel defended yesterday?s cabinet decision, saying only the new airport was being named after Rajiv Gandhi. The name of the existing domestic airport at Begumpet, named after N.T. Rama Rao, was not being changed, he said.

 Dissatisfied with the response, the Opposition members walked out. Laloo Prasad waved his hand and asked the MPs to leave as fast as possible so that business could resume. 

 In the Rajya Sabha, NDA MPs walked into the well of the House and raised slogans. Joining the Desam MPs, BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidu asked the government to explain the logic behind the naming. He asked why the Congress chose Gandhi and not P.V. Narasimha Rao, also a former Prime Minister from the same party.

 The Desam MPs zeroed in on Sonia and said she would be violating government conventions by inaugurating the airport. ?The foundation stone of an international airport should be laid only by the Prime Minister or the President or a constitutional authority.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Irani chai loses steam

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Husain: Wheres the tea?

 Hyderabad, Oct. 30: They cheered B.R. Ambedkar, inspired M.F. Husain and nurtured the dreams of Naxalites and Telengana activists.

 The Irani chai cafes were to Hyderabad what the Coffee House has been to Calcutta: the cradle of revolution, and the favourite haunt of people with the time and willingness to discuss anything under the sun over steaming cups of their favourite brew.

 Now the citys two-century-old institution faces extinction in an age of SMS, Coke and hectic lifestyles.

 From 3,500, their number has dwindled to about 300, with most either closing down or transforming themselves into biryani or snack joints.

 Who has the time for tea now? Everyone is in a hurry, rues Mohammed Sherif Ali, owner of Golden Caf? at the busy Chader Ghat crossing.

 His shop, which once sprawled 3,000 sq ft ? almost the size of an indoor stadium ? has shrunk to hardly 500 sq ft. Since last year, he has been serving meals of dal and rice or chapati as well.

 All those who came to Charminar would drop in at my shop, says Syed Ghousuddin, owner of the nearby Mecca Caf?. But now people dont climb the Charminar; they drive around the monument and leave without even stepping out of their cars.

 Some of the cafes ? Paradise and Garden at Secunderabad, and Nilofuer and Sheriff in the Old City ? had themselves become landmarks for tourists to visit.

 Sheikh Abdulla Khan of Secunderabads Alfa Cafe blames the popularity of the cola. Eateries now offer Pepsi and Coke free with biryani, he says.

 The original chai sellers came to Hyderabad from Iran some 200 years ago to cater to the Nizams Persian cavalrymen. Some of the traders stopped over in Mumbai to open shops there, too.

 One enjoys the chai better after a swig of beer or a bottle of wine and a plateful of biryani, says Abdul Bukhari, manager of Paradise Cafe, Secunderabads largest. You would miss out on the real enjoyment if you were a teetotaller.

 The beverage comes in various flavours and colours. The most popular is pauna (light tea), served straight from the hot kettle. A customer with a sweet tooth might, however, prefer the khada chammach? a syrupy variation with so much sugar in it that a spoon would stand straight in the middle of the cup.

 A more pucca, anglicised tea buff might go for the thick, black suleimani. But if you like a lot of cream in your tea, pardaposh ? where a thick layer of cream hides the tea ? is just the thing for you.

 The 75-year-old Paradise happens to be M.F. Husains favourite. He always comes in whenever he is in Hyderabad. Along with tea, he would order Osmania biscuits, says Rahman, one of the caf?s oldest waiters.

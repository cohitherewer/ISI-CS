 Split stares at Gowda party

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Aug. 1: The Janata Dal (Secular), a coalition partner of the Congress in Karnataka, appeared headed for a split.

 A majority of its legislators backed former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowdas decision to oust the deputy chief minister and legislature party leader, Siddaramaiah.

 The legislators have decided to replace Siddaramaiah as leader of the legislature party with revenue minister M.P. Prakash.

 The relationship between Gowda and Siddaramaiah soured following speculation that the deputy chief minister might join the Congress. The standoff reached a flashpoint when Siddaramaiah ignored Gowdas appeal to skip a meeting of backward classes.

 The MLAs ? 52 out of the partys 59 in the 224-member House ? tonight decided to keep away from a legislature party meeting convened by Siddaramaiah on August 4. They also voted for disciplinary action against him and two other ministers.

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: Whoever said the twain shall never meet had better think again because they are about to ? Barrackpore and Garia or communist-ruled Bengal and American capital.

 Back from a visit to the US, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said the government was trying to get US investment in building an elevated road from Barrackpore in the north to Garia in the south. An arm of this north-south connection could reach out to Behala and beyond.

 A second elevated road could be constructed between the airport and Howrah bridge, the east meeting west.

 All this may seem an American pipedream, but Dasgupta believes: If things go as planned, we hope to see an annual investment of Rs 5,000 crore from the US.

 Dasguptas Mission America followed chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees comment while affirming the CPMs opposition to the joint exercise with the US from the Kalaikunda airbase: We want American money, American knowledge, but not American weapons.

 The finance minister said: At a meeting on November 11 in New York, we explained to the US-India Business Council ? a forum of companies from both countries ? and NRI businessmen how Bengal was going forward with its industrialisation drive and what it needs in terms of investment.

 He extended an invitation to US companies to make a visit and carry on the discussions this winter. 

 We focused on chemicals, drugs and pharmaceuticals, especially in Haldia, and infrastructure in Calcutta and some other districts in south and north Bengal, Dasgupta said.

 Dasgupta left for the US on November 6 to deliver a lecture ? An Alternative Approach to Economic Reforms: Experience in West Bengal ? at MIT, his alma mater, and to seed the ground for a possible Bhattacharjee visit after the 2006 Assembly elections.

 The chief minister and the CPM leadership had given Dasgupta the task of presenting to US investor lobbies Bengals strengths, requirements and its industrialisation drive. 

 The US administration has been keen on a visit by Bhattacharjee. The US ambassador has already extended an invitation to the chief minister, said a government official. He is keen on making a trip, but only when he is reasonably sure of returning home with some gains.

 Apart from the elevated rapid transit system, the possibility of developing river traffic in the joint sector was discussed, Dasgupta said. When it was pointed out that the Japanese were already working on a rapid transit system, he replied: The more companies there are, the better it is for the projects, if there is competition.

 That is as free market as one can get.

 Dasgupta said MIT proposed to create a Calcutta or Bengal chapter, just as there were in Mumbai and Bangalore.

 Border jawans trapped in snow

 Shimla (PTI): At least 17 Indo-Tibetan 

 Border Police jawans are feared trapped under 12 to 14 feet 

 of snow at Saunthin post in Chamba district bordering Jammu 

 and Kashmir.

 The ITBP headquarters and the district administration have not been able to establish any contact with the post for the past two days and an army helicopter sent for reconnaissance could not reach the area due to inclement weather, deputy commissioner, Chamba, Rahul Anand said.

 Despite bad weather, efforts would be made to send the helicopter and rescue teams, he added. 

 After the massacre of 35 people in Satrundi area on August 2,1998, 13 ITBP posts were erected along the border.

 The post can be reached only after 12-14 km of trekking. All the approach roads are now snow-blocked. The Chamba-Sanghani road, the last point from where the steep climb starts, is also blocked due to rain and snow.

 There is sufficient stock of foodgrain and other supplies, including kerosene and dry food, to last several days but the safety of the jawans is a concern, he said.

 Efforts were on to establish wireless contact with the post. Village defence committees and special police officers have volunteered for rescue operations. The district administration has also sought the help of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Manali.

 Air force carts relief to US 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Indian Air Force is flying a planeload of relief to Americas hurricane-affected New Orleans. This follows a donation of $5 million by India to the US Red Cross. 

 India had practically refused aid from the US in the wake of the tsunami that lashed its shores on December 26 last year. An IAF spokesman said an IL-76 transport aircraft will leave Delhi early tomorrow with 25 tonnes of relief. 

 The cavernous hold of the IL-76 ? large enough to carry three tanks and an armoured vehicle ? will be stashed with 50,000 first aid kits, small tarpaulin sheets, blankets and 25,000 cots and pillows.

 The aircraft will fly to New Orleans after touching down at Doha, Cairo and Boston and is expected to reach on September 9. It will be commanded by Group Captain R. Sharma, the commanding officer of 44 (transport) squadron.

 The spokesman said the mission was being coordinated by the Integrated Defence Staff outfit in the ministry of defence and the ministry of external affairs. This is the first supply mission to the US.

 A medical team has also been put on standby and may be sent to the US.

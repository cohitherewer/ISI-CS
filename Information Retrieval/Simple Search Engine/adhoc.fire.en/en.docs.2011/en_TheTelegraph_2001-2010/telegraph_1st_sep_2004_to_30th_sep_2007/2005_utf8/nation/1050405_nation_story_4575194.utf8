 Nirupam knocks on Cong door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 4: Sanjay Nirupam has knocked on Sonia Gandhi?s door to start a career in the Congress, a fortnight after quitting the Rajya Sabha following ?disillusionment? with the Shiv Sena.

 Nirupam met Sonia tonight at the Congress president?s 10 Janpath residence. The meeting lasted 25-30 minutes, said sources.

 That Sonia had agreed to meet Nirupam, according to 10 Janpath sources, indicated that she had an ?open mind? on his induction in the party.

 Nirupam, who represented the north Indian population in the Sena in Mumbai, would be the second-most important saffron recruit to the Congress if taken in. 

 Four years ago, Sonia had inducted former RSS pracharak and senior Gujarat BJP leader Shankarsinh Vaghela into the party. Vaghela is now a cabinet minister in the Manmohan Singh government at the Centre.

 However, many Congress leaders continue to have reservations about bringing Nirupam to the party because of his past tirades against Muslims and Sonia.

 Nirupam quit the Sena stating that he had differences with its chief, Bal Thackeray, over the turning down of his request to raise in the Rajya Sabha the alleged involvement of senior BJP leader Pramod Mahajan in the Reliance Infocom share controversy.

 Nirupam has, since announcing his decision to quit the Sena a month ago, sought to endear himself to the Congress. He denounced the Sena?s Hindutva ideology and embraced secularism. The firebrand politician also visited the dargah of Moinuddin Chisti at Ajmer.

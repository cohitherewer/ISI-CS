 Hope of higher H1B cap

 Washington, Nov. 4 (PTI): In a boost to information technology professionals from India hoping to emigrate to the US, the Senate has voted in favour of increasing the cap on H1B visas by 30,000 to 95,000 from next year.

 The Senate has also voted to increase the number of legal immigrants besides increasing the cap on H1B visas favoured by Indian IT specialists, as part of a bill that was passed yesterday. 

 The Senate judiciary committee had last month called for adding some 90,000 employment-based green cards every year and raising the fee by $500, which would earn about $250 million for the government.

 The bill also removes family members from the ceiling on employment-based immigration visas that would now increase the number of legal immigrants by 240,000 people every year.

 The total increase in immigrants would now come to 330,000 a year, up by nearly 33 per cent.

 The immigration and H1B provisions still have hurdles to pass before becoming law.

 The language of the Senate would now have to be reconciled with that of the House of Representatives.

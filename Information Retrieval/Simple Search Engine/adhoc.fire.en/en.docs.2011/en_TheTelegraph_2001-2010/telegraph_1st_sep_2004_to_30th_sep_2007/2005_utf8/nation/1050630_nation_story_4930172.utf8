 Left mulls third front option

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karat

 Lucknow, June 29: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, who is upset with the Congress-led government at the Centre over the oil price hike and the proposed divestment of Bhel, today met chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 The Samajwadi Party chief told Karat to count him in whenever the Left plans to forge a third front. Mulayam Singh has been harping on such a front for a while and yesterday Karat suggested that the Left was looking for an alternative.

 The CPM leader today said: The subject of an alternative was adopted in the partys Delhi convention held recently and the exercise is on. 

 Asked if the Samajwadi Party would be a part of the front, he said: All the secular forces would be part of this.

 Karat kept up his anti-UPA tirade, saying his party would not budge from its stand on Bhel. During P.V. Narasimha Raos regime, 20 per cent of government stake had been sold, he said. The government is now planning to offload another 10 per cent. 

 If we make any compromise on the Bhel issue, it would have a cascading effect on what will follow next. The UPA government, we have come to know, has prepared a list of other profit-making units like Oil India for disinvestment. We cannot be a party to all these, Karat said.

 The CPM leader said his party would not go back to the committee formed for co-ordination between the Left and the UPA unless the government dropped the Bhel plan. We will then be forced to talk on the issue only in Parliament, he said.

 The Left decided on Sunday to stay away from the committees meetings.

 Karat is likely to meet Sonia Gandhi after he returns to Delhi tomorrow afternoon. Iterating that he had not spoken to the Congress president over phone yesterday, the CPM leader said he only had a message from her that she was willing to speak on PSUs.

 In Lucknow, Karat has attended 12 meetings in two days ? with party workers, union leaders and pressure groups. At all meetings, he was accompanied by former Kanpur MP Subhashini Ali.

 Karat is in the city as part of plans to revive his party in the countrys largest state, where the CPM has only two MLAs, down from four five years ago. 

 He will also work out the partys agitation plan ? against the Centre as well as on issues like the Imrana rape case or the privatisation of the power sector in Uttar Pradesh

 They (critics) are saying we are raising all the issues because state polls in Bengal and Kerala are slated next year. We dont let our national policy be altered because of any region. To tell you the truth, we have no sense of insecurity in the two states, the CPM general secretary said.

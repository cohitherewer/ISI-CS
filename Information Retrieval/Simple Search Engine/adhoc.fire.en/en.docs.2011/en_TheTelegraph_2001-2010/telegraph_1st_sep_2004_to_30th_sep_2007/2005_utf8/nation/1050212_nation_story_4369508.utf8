 SC, govt differ on Dalit quota

 New Delhi: The Centre has questioned 

 the judiciary?s role in determining whether Dalit Christians 

 deserve reservation in jobs and educational institutions, 

 reports our legal correspondent.

 Attorney-general Milon Banerjee argued that the matter was out of the judiciary?s purview as it is in the exclusive policy-making domain of the government. 

 Banerjee also contested the locus standi of the People?s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), which had filed a petition seeking reservation for Dalits who have converted to Christianity. He said reservation cannot be debated by any organisation, association or body, even in the name of human rights.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur argued that the Constitution renders the apex court competent to examine the legality and constitutionality of such a ?crucial? and ?sensitive? matter.

 At this, Banerjee toned down his argument and said that he, as the top judicial officer of the country, has already requested the government to consider the issue sympathetically.

 On October 25, the court had asked the attorney-general to ascertain the Centre?s view on the petition challenging the legality of Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Orders, 1950, according to which people of the SC community professing and converting to religions other than Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism are deprived of reservation benefits.

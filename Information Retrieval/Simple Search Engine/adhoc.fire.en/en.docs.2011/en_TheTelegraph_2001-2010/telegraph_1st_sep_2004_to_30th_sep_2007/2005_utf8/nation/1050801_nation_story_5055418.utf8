The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Offer to probe research fraud suspicions

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, July 31: A science ethics body here has offered to look into the suspicions aired by two top medical journals that an Indian doctor may have fabricated research data for international publications.

 The Society for Scientific Values (SSV), a non-government agency of prominent scientists and engineers that investigates scientific misconduct, would seek details of data collection from the doctor, SSV officials said.

 As reported in The Telegraph on Saturday, the British Medical Journal and The Lancet have expressed concern about the reliability of research data submitted by Dr Ram B. Singh, a private practitioner in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh.

 Singh has published a number of highly cited papers on the protective effects of diet on the heart. He has denied wrongdoing and told The Telegraph that the allegations against him are motivated by professional jealousy and prompted by scientists whose research he had criticised in the past.

 In its commentary, the BMJ said it found no institution in India willing to take on the task to resolve doubts over Singhs work.

 Its the responsibility of the Medical Council of India, but its sleeping, said Dr Raj Tandon, a New Delhi-based doctor who had raised questions about Singhs research in the mid-1990s.

 A senior cardiologist said some of Singhs research results appear so valuable that it is tragic that suspicions have been cast on them.

 A paper by Singh three years ago in The Lancet said that an inexpensive diet of whole grain, legume, fruit, vegetable, nuts and soybean oil could protect the heart. 

 Its a great result, but unless the controversy is resolved, we wont know whether to accept it, said Dr K. Srinath Reddy, head of cardiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.

 Singh said his papers have been cited worldwide and he has been invited to lecture at international conferences. One of Singhs collaborators, Dr Shanti Rastogi, said the suspicions about Singh are unjustified and that Singh has the expertise and facilities for research.

 The SSV would ask Singh to provide details of data and research methods for analysis by experts, said Kasturi Lal Chopra, SSV president and former director of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. But it would be well within his rights to ask us to go away, Chopra said.

 Doctors here said it is irrelevant that the messages in Singhs papers appear to conform with broad medical consensus about diet and heart disease. 

 Method is crucial in research. Even an expected message from fabricated data can do harm to medicine, said Samiran Nundy, a gastrointestinal surgeon and emeritus editor of the National Medical Journal of India.

 Some doctors familiar with Singhs papers said they have been surprised by the astonishing speed with which he churns out research papers. 

 The papers contain the right messages ? about how diet with high fibre food or vegetables protect the heart ? but some of us have been suspicious about the data, said Anoop Misra, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.

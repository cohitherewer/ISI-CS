 Singapore, Aug. 24: It isnt official yet, but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee left Singapore for Jakarta this evening after having clinched at least two deals.

 Two projects ? one on building a logistics hub in Bengal and another on the proposed health city near Calcutta ? are said to have been finalised. 

 Official announcements are likely to come during his trip to Jakarta. Agreements on the two projects could be signed in the Indonesian capital.

 According to sources close to the chief minister, the health city would be a joint venture between the Jakarta-based Salim Group of Industries and a Singapore company that recently bought the majority stake in the Gleneagles group of hospitals, which has a presence in Calcutta in partnership with Apollo.

 Another Singapore company would be involved in the project to create the logistics hub.

 Bhattacharjee had put a great deal of emphasis on investments by Singapore companies in logistics projects. These, along with infrastructure and low-cost housing, were high on his agenda during his interactions with government officials and businessmen here. 

 I didnt know this before but am now told that 92 per cent of the people here live in low-cost houses built by the governments housing development board, he said.

 He had, however, reached an understanding with the Salim group that 10 per cent of the houses in the west Howrah township should be earmarked for poor and low-income groups.

 He seemed to have been able to get some assurances from businessmen and the government here about investments in healthcare systems and education, especially for engineering, medical and management institutes.

 Much would, however, depend on how his government follows up and works on tentative proposals from Singapore companies.

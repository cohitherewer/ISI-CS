 Delhi stingy, cries Jaya 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Dec. 4: Flood politics was on display in Chennai, where water has reached the first-floor level in many suburban areas, with Jayalalithaa today accusing the Centre of being miserly with aid.

 In a brief chat with reporters in the southern suburb of Vellacherry, the chief minister said the Rs 500 crore sanctioned by the Congress-led government at the Centre for immediate relief is hardly adequate.

 Nearly 75,000 people have been moved to safer places from Chennai in the last two days and 140 relief camps have been opened, she said. 

 Tamil Nadu had requested for an advance of Rs 3,000 crore after four battering spells of monsoon rain. The state had sought an assistance of Rs 13,685 crore for relief and rehabilitation, besides 2.58 lakh tonnes of rice and 43,200 kilolitres of kerosene, said Jayalalithaa, who faces an Assembly election in five months. 

 The ADMK chief said before Cyclone Baaz ? which later weakened to a depression ? two central teams had visited the flood-affected parts in the state. She said President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, too, had made an aerial survey and they have seen for themselves the havoc wrought by the floods.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who spoke to me on the telephone and who assured of all possible assistance, was aware of the ground situation in Tamil Nadu, Jayalalithaa said. Given the magnitude of damage to property and infrastructure, how can we be satisfied by the Centres response? she asked.

 A few hours before the chief minister drove out with her convoy to survey flood-hit areas, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi visited some of the most inundated areas this morning.

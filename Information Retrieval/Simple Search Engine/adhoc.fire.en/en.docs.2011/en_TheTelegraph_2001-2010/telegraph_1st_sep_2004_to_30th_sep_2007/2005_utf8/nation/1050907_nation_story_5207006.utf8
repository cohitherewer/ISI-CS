 Ice-cream cover for cash melts

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 6: Senior bureaucrat Anantharamu needed to board a plane with a huge amount of cash and thought it would be cool to hide it in an ice-cream carton.

 He is now in police custody, trying to explain that he didnt intend to hand the Rs 21 lakh over to someone on the flight, which was bound for Sharjah via Bangalore.

 The police suspect that Anantharamu, state director of technical education, is involved with money-launderers.

 The IAS officer claims the money was meant for a surgery his father-in-law was due to undergo in Bangalore the following day.

 At Begumpet airport on Sunday, security officials asked Anantharamu to open his suitcase after the X-ray machine seemed to spot something suspicious. He resisted at first, relenting only when told he wouldnt be allowed to board the flight unless he agreed to have his suitcase thoroughly checked. 

 The money was neatly packed inside the carton, in bundles of 1,000-rupee and 500-rupee notes.

 I got the cash as advance for sale of my wifes plot in Kukkatpally, the official explained. He even produced the sale deed and said that in his hurry, he had forgotten about the airline document that passengers need to sign if they are carrying more than Rs 1 lakh in cash.

 But income-tax sources are not convinced. First, the sale deed mentions Rs 24 lakh. If he is as honest as he claims to be, how come he accepted Rs 21 lakh out of Rs 24 lakh in cash? an official asked. He had also failed to declare the transaction to the department.

 Officials think it significant that the bureaucrat did not take either of the two other flights to Bangalore the same evening, one scheduled an hour before and the other one hour after. Both had empty seats; but neither was Sharjah-bound. Maybe he is innocent, a police officer said, but its also possible that he is part of a hawala gang.

 Mystery minister surprise

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 23: The father of slain BJP leader Haren Pandya today told the Godhra inquiry panel that the ?mysterious? state minister who deposed before the Citizens Tribunal was his son.

 Vitthal Pandya?s claim came during his cross-examination before the Nanavati Commission, which is probing the 2002 Gujarat riots.

 He said Haren had told him that he deposed before the tribunal, set up by eminent citizens for an independent investigation and headed by Justice Krishna Iyer, a retired Supreme Court judge.

 The tribunal?s report, released in late 2003, had indicted the Narendra Modi-led BJP government for ?engineering riots?. It had, however, refused to divulge the name of the minister who deposed. This was allegedly the reason for chief minister Modi denying Haren a ticket from Ellisbridge constituency for the 2002 Gujarat polls.

 Pandya?s confirmation of the voluntary deposition by Haren, the then state revenue minister, is likely to prove damaging to the chief minister because the commission will now have to take note of it, advocate Mukul Sinha said.

 Sinha, the lawyer for an Ahmedabad-based NGO that is helping riot victims, cross-examined Pandya today. 

 Pandya stood by his statement of February 3 made before the Godhra panel. 

 He had said his son told him that Modi held a meeting on the evening of February 27, 2002 (the day of the Godhra tragedy), at Lunawada in Panchmahal, where he instructed 55-odd BJP workers to fan out across the state.

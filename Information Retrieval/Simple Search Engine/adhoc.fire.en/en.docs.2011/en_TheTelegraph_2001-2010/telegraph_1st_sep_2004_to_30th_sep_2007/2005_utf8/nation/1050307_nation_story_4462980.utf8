 Kashmir women kidnapped in south 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, March 6: Police have rescued two women from Jammu and Kashmir who were kidnapped after they came to Hyderabad in search of work.

 The incident took the lid off a kidnapping racket involving poor women from the border state who are then ?married off? to Arab sheikhs, the police said.

 Shafika Begum, 26, Munna Begum, 18, and Gulbahar Begum, 28, had arrived in Hyderabad from their home in Jammu on February 21 with Shafika?s husband Alam Hussain.

 Alam had contacted an acquaintance in the city, Mohammed Hussain, an auto-rickshaw driver, who promised him assistance. On reaching Nampally station, Alam telephoned Mohammed who soon turned up with his associates and took the women away to an unknown destination in the old city.

 Alam rushed to file a complaint with the police and gave details of Mohammed, who had contacted them several times on phone, the police said at a briefing today. Mahesh Bhagat, DCP, south zone, Hyderabad, was present at the briefing.

 Shafika escaped from the clutches of the kidnappers the next day and went to the police. Acting on her statement and along with Alam, the police raided the house at Ashamabad where the women were alleged to have been held captive. But by that time, the kidnappers had fled, taking Munna and Gulbahar with them.

 However, the police kept track of the mobile phone calls made by Mohammed and his accomplices and caught up with them in four days. The women were rescued just in time, before they were to be sent to Mumbai on their way to Dubai, Nampally police inspector Seetharamayya said.

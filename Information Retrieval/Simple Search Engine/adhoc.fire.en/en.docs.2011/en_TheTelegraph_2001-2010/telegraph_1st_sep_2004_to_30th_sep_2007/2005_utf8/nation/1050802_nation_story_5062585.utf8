 Housing land scam raids

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: The 

 Central Bureau of Investigation today raided 77 places in 

 the national capital in connection with an alleged scam 

 in allotting land for housing societies.

 The premises raided include those of several former officials of the registrar of co-operative societies for recommending allotment of land at six to seven times less than prevailing rates to housing societies that had been dormant for long.

 Among those whose official and residential premises were raided are former register Narayan Diwakar, assistant registrars Jitendra Singh Sharma, D.N. Sharma and Yogi Raj, various builders and others.

 The agency was working on these cases since the last three-four months. Different teams of the CBI today struck early in the morning at these places. In all, the CBI has named 48 as accused in the four cases that were registered this Friday, a CBI spokesperson said.

 During searches, a large number of documents relating to irregularities in recommending allotment of land, blank stamp papers and others have been seized, the spokesperson added.

 According to the first information reports filed, a number of co-operative group housing societies were registered in Delhi between 1970 and 1980. Some of them became defunct either because of non-operation or non-submission of auditable accounts, membership list and other documents for verification, mandatory under the Delhi Co-operative Societies Act, 1972.

 The CBI has alleged that due to various reasons, including non-allotment of land, the registrar of co-operative societies wound up several of the societies.

 In 2003, when the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was in the process of developing plots for allotment to about 80 housing societies, certain builders and others hatched a conspiracy with the then registrar, assistant registrars and other c-operative officials, the CBI said.

 The plan, the bureau alleged, was to fraudulently revive the co-operative group housing societies on the basis of false and forged documents and recommend them to the DDA for allotment of land.

 With this intention, these persons caused the disappearance of the original files of these housing societies and created new ones by accepting bogus and forged records from the so-called office-bearers of these societies.

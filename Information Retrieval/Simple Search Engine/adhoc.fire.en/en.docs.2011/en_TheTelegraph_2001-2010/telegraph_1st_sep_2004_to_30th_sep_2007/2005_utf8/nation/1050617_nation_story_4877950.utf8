 Nod for FDI in news

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 16: The Union cabinet today took several significant steps towards the eventual opening up of the media to foreign investment.

 The cabinet has approved foreign direct investment in the news and current affairs segments, paving the way for investments by NRIs, persons of Indian origin, overseas corporate bodies as well as portfolio investments by recognised foreign institutional investors bringing in funds for the print media within the existing 26 per cent cap.

 The cabinet also approved the recommendation by the group of ministers that facsimile editions of foreign newspapers be allowed, but with two riders to make it acceptable to the United Progressive Alliances Left allies. 

 These editions will have only foreign content and will carry no Indian advertisement. This would enable Indian readers to buy foreign newspapers on the same day and at much lower rates.

 These editions can be brought out by an Indian entity with or without FDI and also by the foreign company that owns the original newspaper, but will have to be registered under the Companies Act and have to comply with the countrys laws.

 However, these editions cannot be specially designed for India as they have to be copies of the original published abroad. 

 The existing policy of not allowing publication of Indian editions of foreign newspapers will continue, said a statement released after the cabinet meeting.

 Todays decision formalises the tie-up between the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chronicle and the International Herald Tribune, under which a facsimile edition is printed by Midram ? an Indian-owned company. 

 The Cabinet also raised the limit of syndication from the existing 7.5 per cent of total printed matter to 20 per cent, giving Indian newspapers much more leeway to carry foreign items. 

 The cabinet said in certain cases the limit can go beyond 20 per cent of syndicated material but this will be considered by the information and broadcasting ministry on a case-by-case basis.

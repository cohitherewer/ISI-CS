 Fugitive MP surfaces

 Patna, Dec. 19: Former Union minister Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav, the MP from Munger, finally turned up at a police station in Jamui today for interrogation in keeping with an earlier order of Patna High Court, reports our correspondent.

 Yadav, who resigned as minister after non-bailable arrest warrants were issued against him, had been evading arrest for a long time.

 The high court had recently rejected the MPs bail plea and directed him to co-operate with the police. But the court provided limited relief to the politician as it directed that he should not be arrested before a chargesheet was filed.

 The MP is accused of getting his brother Vijay Prakash unlawfully released from Khaira police station in Jamui.

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: A court in Yamunagar in Haryana has granted bail to human resource development minister Arjun Singh in a defamation case filed by an RSS leader. 

 Judicial magistrate Atul Maurya granted Singh bail on a surety of Rs 10,000 and conditional exemption from personal appearance in a case filed by local RSS leader Darshan Lal Jain. The case relates to a speech made by the minister in the capital in August last year in which he accused the RSS of killing Mahatma Gandhi. 

 The minister, who appeared in court this morning, had moved an application for bail. The next hearing will be held on March 6, when the co-accused will have to appear. 

 RSS spokesman Ram Madhav said: ?He has made certain defamatory remarks about the Sangh. He has to establish in court that what he said is factually true.?

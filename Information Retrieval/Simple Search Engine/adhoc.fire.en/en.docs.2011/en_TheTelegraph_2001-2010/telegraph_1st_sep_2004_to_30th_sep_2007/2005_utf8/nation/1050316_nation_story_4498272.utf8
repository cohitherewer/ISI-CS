The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 University test of English, written in Telugu

 Pratispardhito yela meeru vyavaharistharu?

 Samajam lo prati paurudu cheyalsina kartavyamulu yevi?

 That?s English for you if you are in Guntur.

 And that?s only two of the questions in the Communicative English paper that Bachelor of Education students faced in some parts of the Andhra Pradesh town.

 Over 75 of them responded in like manner, writing answers in Telugu to questions in that language, like those given above that should have read:

 How will you approach your opponent and win him over?

 What are the basic duties of a citizen towards society?

 Acharya Nagarjuna University of Guntur handed out the Telugu translation by mistake during the B.Ed final examinations that got over on Saturday.

 The varsity has the practice of providing question papers in Telugu for all subjects other than a student?s main subject and the sciences. It has even allowed answers in Telugu in the Sanskrit and Hindi papers.

 ?The Telugu translation is given only to help students understand the questions. It was not meant that they should answer in Telugu,? said Suresh Alapati, a lecturer who is involved in the examination process.

 The students maintained they did nothing wrong because the paper was in Telugu. ?There was no mention of restrictions in the question paper on answering it in Telugu,? said Gopinath Rao, one of those who answered in their mother tongue.

 The practice, according to senior faculty member Rammohan Rao, was restricted to non-English subjects.

 ?The answers in Telugu have defeated the very purpose of their studying Communicative English,? rued a professor of the university.

 The subject was started two academic sessions ago for non-English-medium students in all courses so they could write their bio-data and correspondence in English, a senior faculty member told The Telegraph over phone.

 The varsity?s other students who received the English version and answered in that language are worried about the fallout of the fiasco. 

 ?We might lose marks along with those who wrote in their mother tongue,? said Prabhakar, a 21-year-old student of the local A.C. College.

 The practice, however, is nothing new, according to Vedamurthy Gopalan, a lecturer of the university.

 MA English students in most of Andhra?s universities are allowed to write answers in Telugu, he said. 

 ?The practice continues even today to help students from the Telugu medium,? he added.

 The B.Ed students have found support in Lok Satta, an NGO that champions people?s issues. It has urged the university to correct the error by passing all students who answered in Telugu.

 Plane snag

 New Delhi, Sept. 25 (PTI): Passengers of the Air-India flight for Frankfurt were stranded as the plane which was to take off from here last evening could not fly even today due to a brake failure.

 The director of Air-India, northern region, Devender Singh Kohli, said the snag was detected last evening just before take-off and was thought to have been rectified. But when passengers boarded the plane this morning, the pilot again found some error message on the computer. 

 Our engineers are on the job and tentatively we will send the plane tomorrow morning, Kohli said.

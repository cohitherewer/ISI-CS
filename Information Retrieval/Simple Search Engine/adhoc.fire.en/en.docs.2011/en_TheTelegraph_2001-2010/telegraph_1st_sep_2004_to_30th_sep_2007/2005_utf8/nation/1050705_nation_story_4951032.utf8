 Plea to save wife from in-laws

 New Delhi, July 4 (PTI): A man has moved Delhi High Court urging it to direct police to rescue his wife from her parents who, he alleges, have confined her illegally.

 Amrit, who married Deepika (names changed) on November 28, 2004, expressed apprehension in his habeas corpus petition that his wife could be shifted to an unknown location as his in-laws were opposed to their inter-caste marriage.

 Deepika went to her parents home soon after the marriage, but kept it secret till January this year. When she told her parents about the marriage in February they illegally confined her in their house in the railway colony at Mandawali in east Delhi, Amrit alleged.

 Delhi police counsel Mukta Gupta, however, has said Deepika told the police that though she did marry Amrit, she no longer wanted to stay with him.

 Deepika was produced in court and a division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul examined her and Amrit in a chamber hearing. 

 The bench directed the police to produce her again on July 8.

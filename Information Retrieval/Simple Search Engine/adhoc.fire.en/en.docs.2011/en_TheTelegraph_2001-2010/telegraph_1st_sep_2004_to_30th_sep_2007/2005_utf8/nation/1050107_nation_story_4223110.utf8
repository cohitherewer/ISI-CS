 Port Blair, Jan. 6: Sharad Kumar had promised his wife he would be back home soon. The 24-year-old could not keep his word.

 He died on Tuesday while hauling stranded survivors to safety off Camorta island, about 400 km from Port Blair.

 ?He was involved in search and relief operations when he slipped and fell overboard, but by then he had saved several lives,? a defence spokesman said.

 Kumar, one of the most technically-skilled on board the Indian Naval Ship Cheetah, had got married to his childhood sweetheart Subodh just a year ago in Ram Salwani, a small town in Uttar Pradesh. ?It is extremely unfortunate that we lost him. But he died a hero?s death,? said Rakesh Kala, rear admiral and chief of staff, Andaman and Nicobar command.

 His death was the first casualty since the unified command of the army, navy and air force stepped up rescue efforts in tsunami-ravaged areas.

 Tales of heroism have also trickled in from other places. Commanding officer Deepak Dhar risked his life along with his men when he took INS Magar, a carrier of tanks and commandos during wartime, to Chawra island, 80 km from Port Blair, though his orders were not to venture into the dangerous waters.

 ?We had warned him because anything could have happened there. But he said the entire crew wanted to risk their lives and Dhar went ahead with his mission and pulled it off,? Kala said.

 On January 3, Dhar and his men evacuated 442 survivors from Chawra island to the nearby Alunang village relief camp at Teressa. ?First, there was no place to dock, but I somehow found about 200 meters near Teressa to drop anchor and operate by sending boats to Chawra,? said Dhar, who could not stay away when he heard that people were without any water.

 ?We had to evacuate them but since the sea was very rough we decided to do it in two batches. On the first day, 442 were evacuated in boats. The next day, 383 were rescued,? he said.

 The boats suffered heavy damages, but the furious naval command was happy to learn about Dhar?s heroics. INS Magar also conducted rescue missions in Teressa, Katchal and Camorta, where they dropped food packets, before reaching Port Blair yesterday.

 INS Tillanchang not only saved lives but also reached rice, sugar and other food supplies and clothes to the Shom Pens while passing by the Great Nicobar island. ?One among the (tribal) group, which had come in boats, said in broken Hindi that all of them are safe,? said Rajiv Sharma, the commanding officer of the ship.

 One sailor on board the INS Tillanchang, Anuj Tyagi, stands out for his heroism.

 ?Two yardships, which could carry a lot of oil and other cargo material, were getting adrift when the tsunami struck. Anuj risked his life and jumped into one of the yardships and dropped anchor. He did the same with another on his own and saved two ships,? said commodore Sankaran Mampully, the naval officer in charge of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. ?He is a real hero.?

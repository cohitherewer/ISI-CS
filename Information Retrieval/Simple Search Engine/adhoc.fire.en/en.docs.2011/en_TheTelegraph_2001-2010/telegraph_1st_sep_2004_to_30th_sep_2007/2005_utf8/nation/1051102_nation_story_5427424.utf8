 Tax relief sets stage for ICC tourney 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: India can now host next years ICC Champions Trophy with the Centre granting income-tax exemptions on earnings from international sporting events in the country.

 The International Cricket Council had threatened to award the event to some other country if the tax exemption was not granted. After a series of hectic discussions with the Indian cricket board, the Centre ? barely a week before the ICC deadline of May 31 this year ? decided to allow the exemption through an ordinance.

 The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2005, became law after the President gave his assent last night. The ordinance has inserted a new clause (39) into the Income Tax Act, exempting specified income arising from any multi-nation sporting event held in India.

 This is a huge relief for the Indian board, which hopes to host the 2011 World Cup. Finance minister P. Chidambaram had said the amendment would help India host not only the ICC Champions Trophy, but also other international sporting events.

 The ordinance has also revived hopes for an early commissioning of the Dabhol power project. 

 A specific clause (40) allows a company engaged in generation, transmission or distribution of power to claim tax exemption for income received through settlement of dues.

 Clause (40) exempts any income of any subsidiary company by way of grant or otherwise received from an Indian company, being its holding company engaged in the business of generation, transmission or distribution of power if such receipt is for settlement of dues in connection with reconstruction or revival of an existing business of power generation taken over by an Indian company, the ordinance states. 

 The amended tax law will also exempt any income arising from transfer of a capital asset of an undertaking engaged in the business of generation, transmission or distribution of power.

 Also, an undertaking owned by an Indian company and set up for reconstruction or revival of a power generating plant shall be eligible for tax benefits. But there is a condition: such companies must start generating, distributing and transmitting power by March 31, 2007, and their majority equity must be held by Indian public sector companies.

 Church film in AIDS fight

 For a cause: Rati 

 Agnihotri, Johny Lever

 New Delhi, June 30: It deals with sex. And Mahesh Bhatt is lending a helping hand. But the maverick director is not the producer.

 It is the Catholic Church.

 The rapid spread of AIDS in the country has forced the church to try out a medium that attracts mass attention ? a Bollywood-style commercial ? to highlight the dangers of risky sex.

 The church, which earlier faced criticism for opposing use of contraceptives, thinks a film on how the virus spreads can send the right message.

 In India, the one medium that attracts mass attention, whether literate or unlettered, whether rich or poor, small or big, low caste or upper caste, is cinema, said Father Dominic Emmanuel, spokesman for the Delhi Catholic Archdiocese.

 Emmanuel, who is producing the film called Aisa Kyon Hota Hain (Why Does This Happen?), plays a college principal in the commercial. 

 The film, which revolves around an HIV-positive character, also has another theme: need for religious harmony in a country of one billion.

 Set for release in September, the film is directed by Ajay Kanchan, a former Unicef officer. 

 The cast includes Johny Lever in the role of a basketball coach, models-turned-actor Aryan Vaid, Avtar Gill, and Rati Agnihotri of Ek Duje Ke Liye fame who is cast in the role of a mother.

 VJ-turned-model Megha Chatterjee and Shruti Mehrotra, a Telugu actor, play the main characters. 

 Bhatts firm, Vishesh Films, is responsible for the launch and publicity of the film in Hindi.

 Emmanuel said the church did not try to hire big Bollywood names as it had a low budget for the film. The money ? Rs 1.3 crore ? has come from voluntary groups involved in promoting awareness on AIDS.

 The film is on relations, between mother and son, between friends and between communities and if we do not respect relationship, there can be several consequences. One is HIV, another is communal disharmony, the Archdiocese spokesman said. 

 The basic idea, he added, is to promote traditional values.

 Shot in Mumbai, the film will be dubbed in Tamil and Telugu as the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are home to many of Indias 5.1 million people afflicted with the deadly virus.

 Fighter race hots up

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Indian Air Force has thrown open the competition for a bulk order of 125 multi-role fighter aircraft that will form the cutting edge of its fighting fleet in the medium term. 

 The chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, said four companies have been asked to send details on their multi-role fighters that would be considered for the order.

 This easily makes the order one of the most lucrative ones in the global military market. Official sources refuse to put a value on the order. 

 The only indication is that when the IAF inducted the Mirage fighters in the 1980s, each aircraft cost about Rs 120 crore.

 But what the IAF?s decision to approach at least four companies means is that France?s Dassault Aviation, with its offer of the Mirage 2000-V, is not necessarily the most preferred choice at the air headquarters. 

 The Mirage 2000 is already in service with the IAF and the air headquarters was so far understood to have voiced a preference for it. The decision to approach a number of companies is also in line with an acquisition policy of the defence establishment to avoid a single-vendor situation.

 Air Chief Marshal Tyagi said requests for information have been sent to companies ? the US, Sweden and Russia, apart from France. Air headquarters sources said the aircraft on which information has been requested are the F-16 Fighting Falcon (Lockheed Martin, US), Grippen (Saab, Sweden), Mirage 2000-V (Dassault Aviation, France) and the Russians for Sukhois and the MiG 29 MCR.

 The IAF currently has two squadrons (about 40) of the French-built Mirage 2000. It is also in the process of acquiring 10 Mirage fighters from Qatar.

 Tyagi said moves are on to ensure that there is no depletion in the IAF?s fighting elements. The need to acquire new aircraft comes from the decision to phase out the ageing MiG 21 fighters. The MiG 21s are air defence fighters and form the bulk of the IAF?s fighter strength.

 Asked if the IAF was concerned about Pakistan?s proposed acquisition of F-16 fighters, he said: ?We oppose it and we have to cater for it. We have our plans to counter them. Acquisition is a constant process. I don?t think we need to get worried about it.?

 Air Chief Marshal Tyagi, who took over last fortnight from Air Chief Marshal (now retired) S. Krishnaswamy, said a change in the air headquarters does not mean that previous policies will necessarily be reviewed.

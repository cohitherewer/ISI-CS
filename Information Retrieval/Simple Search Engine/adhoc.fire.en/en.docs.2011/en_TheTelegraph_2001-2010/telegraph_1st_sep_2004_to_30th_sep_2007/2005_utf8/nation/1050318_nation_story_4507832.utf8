 A three-judge bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices G.P. Mathur and P.K. Balasubramanyan sought an action taken report on creating and updating the National Citizenship Register, pending since 1951. The creation of the register was a major aspect of the Assam accord.

 The All India Lawyers Forum for Civil Liberties, Asom Gana Parishad MP Sarabananda Sonowal and Ramesh Borpatra Gohain from Assam had filed petitions seeking a directive to deport the Bangladeshis. The state of Bengal, the Jamait Ulama-e-Hind of Assam, and Abu Hanif of Delhi filed petitions opposing the plea and seeking a directive to continue with the Illegal Migrants Act and extend it to other states.

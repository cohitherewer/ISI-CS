The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 F-16 claws come out

 - CPM howls, PM parries

 OUR BUREAU

 March 28: The first wave of euphoria has ebbed and the velvet gloves are slowly coming off.

 India today said the US decision to lift the ban on F-16 sale to Pakistan would have an ?adverse impact? on the ongoing composite dialogue with the neighbour.

 ?The US decision to supply F-16s to Pakistan at this point is inappropriate and ill-timed since the two countries are engaged in a composite dialogue on improving bilateral relations. This will have an adverse impact on the ongoing dialogue,? defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Calcutta on the sidelines of a business meeting.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had expressed ?deep disappointment? when President George W. Bush had called him on Friday to convey the decision to sell the fighter planes to Pakistan.

 However, once the Americans tried to pacify Delhi by offering F-16s, dangling advanced F-18s and promising access to nuclear technology, the foreign policy establishment had sought to convey an impression that India had gained more than Pakistan.

 The defence minister said Pakistan needs F-16s not to fight terrorism but to wage war. ?The previous track record has shown that Pakistan had not fired a single shot at any other direction but India,? Mukherjee said.

 The minister?s blunt statement coincided with a demand by the CPM that the government should not accept the offer of F-16s.

 But the Prime Minister adopted a cautious stand, saying it would be ?premature? to talk about the US offer. But Singh added that his government was willing to discuss the subject with the US.

 The CPM politburo said: ?India should outright reject the proposal to join the infamous national missile defence system (America had also hinted at cooperation in missile defence).?

 Referring to the F-16 offer, the party added: ?It suits the US to fuel an arms race between India and Pakistan with the sale of sophisticated weapons to both countries. It also provides a good market for its arms manufacturers.?

 Singh, however, was non-committal: ?As far as we are concerned it is an offer. We do not know the terms and conditions. It would be premature for me to comment.?

 He added that ?we have good relations with the US. We do not know what we will be getting. We will discuss with them.?

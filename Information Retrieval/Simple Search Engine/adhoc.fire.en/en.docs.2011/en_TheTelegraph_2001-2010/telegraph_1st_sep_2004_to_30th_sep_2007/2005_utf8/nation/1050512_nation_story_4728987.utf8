 Govt in arms law hurry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: With the Left withdrawing reservations, a bill against weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and their delivery systems is likely to be passed in the next two days.

 The law will provide an integrated legislative basis to Indias commitment to prevent proliferation of WMDs.

 The government wanted to pass the bill before Parliament adjourns sine die on Friday as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is visiting the US in July. 

 The bill was piloted today by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee on behalf of the foreign minister. 

 The Left parties had earlier insisted that the bill be sent to a select committee to discuss the fallout of the legislation in depth. The government wants to avoid the select committee route as it fears that the BJP, which is now boycotting Parliament, could block the bill there.

 Many countries have passed the law. Apart from scoring a diplomatic point with the US, the move will help India push its case for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. This is another reason Delhi is keen to have the law in place before a key UN session begins in September.

 The passage of the legislation will also help the government get supplies for nuclear power plants from Russia. 

 The envisaged control over the export of WMD-usable material, equipment and technologies will also fulfil Indias mandatory obligations under a Security Council resolution adopted in April last year.

 The overarching legislation to prohibit unlawful activities in relation to weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery and related dual-use material, equipment and technologies is part of a commitment India made to prevent non-state actors and terrorists from acquiring WMDs.

 In view of Indias status as a nuclear weapon state and its international commitments, it was felt necessary to introduce the legislation, a statement that accompanied the bill said. 

 Observing that India remained committed to safeguarding its national security as a nuclear weapon state, the statement said the countrys policy had always been not to assist, encourage or induce any other country to manufacture WMDs, including nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.

 Relief for Bhujbal in Telgi scam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 (Top) Bhujbal, Jethmalani

 New Delhi, July 24: The name of former Maharashtra chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal will not appear in the new chargesheet the Central Bureau of Investigation will probably file sometime this week in the stamp paper scam, according to bureau sources.

 The CBI has also decided not to frame charges against former Union law minister Ram Jethmalani, whose name had appeared in the special investigation teams report.

 However, the bureau will frame charges against former Andhra Pradesh minister C.B. Krishna Yadav, the former MLA from Dhule in Mumbai, Anil Umrao, and nine police officers, including former Mumbai police commissioner R.S. Sharma, for helping scam kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi.

 The CBI has included Yadavs name on the basis of a cassette recovered from Telgis house during raids. The cassette contained the voice of a politician demanding money from Telgi for helping him out in the scam. Forensic studies revealed the voice matched that of Yadav.

 The chargesheet has assumed special significance as it involves senior politicians and bureaucrats.

 The investigating team could not establish any criminal connection between Bhujbal and Antim Totla, whom the former chief minister had allegedly given shelter to during the scam.

 Another allegation against Bhujbal is that he had transferred Sharma to Mumbai on Telgis insistence. But the CBI found that Bhujbal and Telgi had never talked to each other.

 Cong sees tough fight in Bihar

 Laloo Prasad

New Delhi, Oct. 1: The race for Bihar could again see a neck-and-neck fight between the Laloo Prasad Yadav-led combine and the one headed by Nitish Kumar, according to an internal pre-poll survey commissioned by the Congress. 

 Aligned firmly with the Rashtriya Janata Dal this time, the Congress might take its tally of seats beyond the 10 it won in March. But it may not be enough for Laloo Prasad to tilt the balance in favour of the United Progressive Alliance.

 The repeat of another hung Assembly is a distinct possibility after the October-November polls, though there is also a fear that the rival National Democratic Alliance might end up improving on its March performance, sources said.

 Alluding to the survey, the sources said the Ram Vilas Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party may have lost many of its winnable candidates to the Janata Dal (United) this time, but the party might again play spoilsport for the UPA.

 The survey is understood to have pointed to the need for micro-management of the election at the constituency level, particularly in segments where the margin of victory or defeat last time was narrow, in many cases less than a thousand votes.

 Congress poll managers have advised Laloo Prasad to tighten his partys hold over Yadav votes as, in their reckoning, the RJD suffered significant reverses because of a large number of Independent Yadav candidates in the last polls. 

 The survey has confirmed the Congresss worst fears ? that the RJD-led alliance could make the contest much easier for the Dal (U) and the BJP if it fails to carry the LJP along.

 Contrary to the neck-and-neck race projected by the survey, a detailed analysis of the last elections by Congress strategists sometime ago had convinced them that if Paswans party was part of the UPA, the combine would have won two-thirds of the 243 seats in the Assembly. According to the analysis, the NDA might not have got even 60 to 65 seats.

 Congress poll managers are understood to have decided to go in for joint campaigning by top alliance leaders because of the tough battle the survey has projected.

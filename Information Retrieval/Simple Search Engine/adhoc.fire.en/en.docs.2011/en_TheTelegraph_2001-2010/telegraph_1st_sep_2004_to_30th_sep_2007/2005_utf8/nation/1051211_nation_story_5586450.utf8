 India joins global war on graft

 New York, Dec. 10 (PTI): India has signed the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, which envisages return of ill-gotten assets to countries of origin. 

 Indias ambassador to the UN, Nirupam Sen, signed the anti-corruption convention during a brief ceremony at the world bodys headquarters here yesterday. 

 So far, 118 countries, including Indias neighbours China, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka, have signed it. The US, Russia, the UK, France, Germany, Japan, the Maldives, Australia and South Africa are also among its signatories. 

 The clause of asset recovery will support the members efforts to redress the worst effects of corruption while sending a message to corrupt officials that there would be no place to hide their illicit assets. 

 The 71-article convention also provides for international cooperation and mutual legal assistance in investigation of cases of corruption. 

 The signatories are bound by the convention to render specific forms of assistance in gathering and transferring evidence for use in court and to extradite offenders. 

 The members are also required to undertake measures which will support the tracing, freezing, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of corruption.

 ?Autocrat? Indira on Bihar website

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, April 14: The Bihar administration, under Governor Buta Singh, has learnt to call a spade a spade, or so it seems, if the state?s just updated and upgraded official website is a yardstick to go by.

 Else, it was hard to imagine that with Congress veteran Singh at the helm of affairs, the authorities would have gone as far as they have in chronicling the state?s history. The site, www.bihar.nic.in, plays glowing tribute to Jaya Prakash Narayan and does not hesitate to open a frontal attack on the Congress, Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi.

 ?It was he (JP) who steadfastly and staunchly opposed the autocratic rule of Indira Gandhi and her younger son, Sanjay Gandhi. Fearing people?s reaction to his opposition, Indira Gandhi had him arrested on the eve of declaring National Emergency beginning June 26, 1975,? it says.

 ?He was put in Tihar Jail, where notorious criminals are jailed. Thus, in free India, this septuagenarian, who had fought for India?s freedom alongside Indira Gandhi?s father, Jawaharlal Nehru, received a treatment that was worse than what the British had meted out to Gandhiji in Champaran in 1917, for his speaking out against oppression,? it adds.

 An official at the state unit of National Informatics Centre, which hosts the official site, said they had nothing to do with the content posted on the portal. ?There is a disclaimer to this effect on the site. We just put in what we receive from the state government, the cabinet coordination department to be exact,? he added.

 An official, who played a role in the preparation of the content, said ?at a preliminary glance? there was nothing wrong in the description of JP?s role although ?everyone might not agree with the wording of that description?. 

 Eminent historian Surendra Gopal said he would not go as far as to describe Indira Gandhi as ?autocratic, although at a later stage of the Emergency she did develop such a tendency?. 

 ?I would like to point out another mistake. The treatment meted out to JP has been described as being worse than what Gandhiji received at the hands of the British. But the fact is that Gandhiji was not jailed in Champaran for even an hour. He was tried for violating an official order against his entering Champaran but was soon released on the directives of then governor. I am not privy to the kind of treatment JP received at Tihar Jail,? Gopal said.

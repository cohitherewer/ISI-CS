 Two blasts in Maoist attack, says CRPF 

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: Embarrassed by the Chhattisgarh governments anti-landmine vehicle being blown apart by Maoists, the CRPF has claimed it was targeted with twin blasts ? with a mine and a powerful improvised explosive device.

 The explosions on Saturday had broken the mine-proof vehicle (MPV) in two and killed 24 people, including 22 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force.

 Officers are scrambling to explain why the MPV ? which had boosted the confidence of CRPF and state police personnel by withstanding an attack in May ? had flopped this time.

 CRPF sources said a landmine had gone off right under the vehicle while the other blast ? probably the more powerful one ? was triggered by the guerrillas with a wire-controlled device. They said the wreckage of the vehicle suggested it had suffered two dents, one on each side.

 The Maoists, the sources believe, wanted to test the MPV with a bigger attack after their previous failure.

 The National Security Guard bomb squad and the central forensic laboratory team are continuing with their investigations, but the initial findings suggest the Maoists probably used a gelatin-based improvised explosive device.

 The twin blasts lifted the vehicle 20 feet in the air and hurled it 90 feet forward in a parabola, creating a crater 10 feet wide and 8 feet deep on the metalled road.

 The state government had bought the MPV recently from the defence ordnance factory in Medak, Andhra Pradesh, with the Centres assistance. The vehicle was seen as key to the battle against Maoists.

 Sources said the Naxalite squad that ambushed the vehicle had been tracking it and had carried out the operation in a well-planned manner. 

 The CRPF team travelling in the vehicle had been after the trail of the same guerrilla squad for five days before being ambushed, which means the Naxalites had better information of the CRPFs movements than the force had of theirs, a senior officer said.

 The CRPF, which has six battalions deployed in Chhattisgarh, is planning a major offensive against the Maoist group that carried out the attack.

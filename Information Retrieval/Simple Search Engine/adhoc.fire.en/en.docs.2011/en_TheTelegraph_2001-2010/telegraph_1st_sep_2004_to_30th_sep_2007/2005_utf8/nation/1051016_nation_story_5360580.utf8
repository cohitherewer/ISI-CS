 Pataudi in court to keep sister out of home

 RASHEED KIDWA

 Pataudi: No love lost

 Bhopal, Oct. 15: Mansur Ali Khan, the Nawab of Pataudi, has moved Jabalpur High Court against a fast-track court verdict that granted his sisters the right to use the disputed Flag Staff House, their ancestral palace worth Rs 100 crore.

 Pataudis move came after his sister Sabiha sent a fax from Hyderabad seeking the keys to the mansion. The caretaker declined to hand over the keys, asking her to wait till Pataudi returned from Britain in November.

 Yesterday afternoon, Pataudis counsel R.H. Khan moved Jabalpur High Court on the basis of power of attorney.

 Flag Staff House, spread over seven acres, used to be the residence of Pataudis grandfather, Nawab Hamidullah Khan ? the last ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Bhopal who died in 1960.

 After his death, his second daughter Sajida ? Pataudis mother ? became the legal owner. According to Shariat law, her three children ? Sabiha, Saleha and Mansoor (Pataudi) ? are now joint owners of the property.

 The dispute between Pataudi and Sabiha gained momentum during her visit to the city in July 2003. Sabiha, prevented from staying at the mansion, moved court against her brother.

 But Pataudi claimed that he was merely a tenant of Flag Staff House, paying a rent of Rs 2,000, and thus could not allow his sisters to stay in the palace. He said their mother had appointed him a tenant a few months before she died in 1995.

 The Bhopal court rejected his plea, pointing out that the lease document was not valid. The additional district judge observed that Sabiha and Saleha had the right to use the house, as Pataudis lease as tenant had expired on May 12 and he had not renewed it.

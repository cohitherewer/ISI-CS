 Pak to be briefed on Kotla match

 Minster Manmohan Singh.

 Shaharyar returned to Lahore from Delhi on Sunday after spending the last two days of his stay in India holding a series of meetings with the Delhi and District Cricket Association, external affairs ministry, Delhi government and the Pakistan high commission officials.

 ?After these meetings, what has been conveyed to me is that the match will now be held at the Feroze Shah Kotla despite the limited seating capacity. What we are only concerned about is where will President Musharraf sit,? Shaharyar was quoted as saying in the media.

 ?They have shown me two or three spots where they plan to arrange the seating for President Musharraf and the Indian Prime Minister during the match and I will be briefing the foreign office on everything, including the security arrangements being made at the stadium,? said Shaharyar, who has also served as the Pakistan high commissioner in New Delhi.

 Snow wrecks border fence

 Jammu (PTI): Recent snowfall and avalanches 

 in Jammu and Kashmir have caused extensive ?damage? to the 

 fencing along the 740-km Indo-Pak border, a top army commander 

 said here on Sunday.

 A survey is going on along the border to assess the damage caused by the heavy snowfall in February, said the commander of the Nagrota-based 16 Corps, Lieutenant General Sudhir Sharma.

 ?The construction of the border fence would commence as soon as the survey to identify the areas and extent of damage caused is completed by the engineering regiment of the army,? he added.

 Ground and aerial surveys of the fencing have been undertaken to assess the damage. Sharma said at places no fencing is visible as it is buried in 10-15 feet snow.

 rushing aside concern over the issue, Sharma said: ?We are committed to complete the repair of the entire fencing as soon as the snow melts and the survey is completed.?

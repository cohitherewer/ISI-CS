 IAF officer faces court of inquiry today

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, May 9: Flying officer Anjali Gupta will tomorrow face the court of inquiry set up to probe charges of sexual harassment made by her against three senior officers of the Indian Air Force.

 The flying officer, who faces seven charges of financial irregularities, indiscipline and insubordination, appeared at the general court martial today with a fresh plea that the case against her was not investigated properly.

 Gupta, who took ill last week and was admitted to the air force command hospital for treatment of pain in the abdomen, invited the wrath of the general court martial by turning up 45 minutes late.

 Defending officer Wing Commander Vijay Bhupesh too, turned up late, citing lack of transport to arrive at the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE) here. Later, Gupta made a plea that the case against her was not investigated properly. Neither did the commanding officer at ASTE investigate it properly nor were relevant rules of the IAF Act applied, she said.

 The presiding officer, Group Captain V. Ganesh, asked the prosecution to give its objections, if any, on Tuesday. The court of inquiry, headed by Air Vice-Marshal V.R. Iyer, has asked Gupta to make her statement on Tuesday.

 Iyer said members of the court had met her at the air force command hospital on Thursday and Friday. ?She asked for some time to refer to her notes and to seek permission of the general court martial. The adjutant (at ASTE) has been asked to make her available for the inquiry, where she has to give a statement under oath,? he said.

 Air Vice-Marshal Iyer said the court was scheduled to submit its report to the headquarters, Training Command, Bangalore, today. ?Once her statement is made tomorrow and we examine the facts, the inquiry should be completed in a week. We have collected some documents and we will talk to the officers (named in her complaint to the chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi on April 7, 2005) before submitting our report.?

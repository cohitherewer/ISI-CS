 Centaur glare on Atal in-law

 Kin under cloud

 New Delhi, July 27: The Left has upped the ante on the Centaur hotel deal.

 At a news conference this afternoon, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat demanded a CBI probe into the personal assets of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees foster son-in-law Ranjan Bhattacharya, whom the Left has accused of having a hand in the sale.

 Karat addressed the conference along with a three-member panel of Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, CPM MP Dipankar Mukherjee and journalist Paranjoy Guha Thakurta. The panel also criticised the CBI for giving the impression that it might close the Centaur file even before a proper inquiry has begun.

 Newspaper reports have indicated that the CBI has not yet decided whether to open a preliminary inquiry or register a case, it said.

 During the last Parliament session, Left parties had forced the Congress-led government to order an inquiry into the sale by the then Vajpayee government after the Comptroller and Auditor Generals report revealed several irregularities.

 A.L. Batra had bought the Mumbai-based Centaur hotel for Rs 83 crore and then sold it for Rs 115 crore within four months. 

 At todays news conference, the panel targeted Bhattacharya. There is an undeniable link between Bhattacharya and Batra. We want the CBI to probe this, said Bhushan.

 We do not want them (the CBI) to waste their time drinking Madras coffee or Beijing tea offered by Arun Shourie, the panel said, alluding to the former disinvestment ministers comment last week that if investigators came to his home he would personally serve them Madras coffee and jasmine tea from Beijing. Shourie remains Bhattacharyas shield and facilitator, the panel added.

 The CBI, the speakers said, is expected to look into why the best possible price was not obtained for the hotel.

 Both Shourie and Bhattacharya rejected the allegations. Shourie said Bhattacharya had never spoken to him about any divestment. Bhattacharya said he had nothing to do with the sale.

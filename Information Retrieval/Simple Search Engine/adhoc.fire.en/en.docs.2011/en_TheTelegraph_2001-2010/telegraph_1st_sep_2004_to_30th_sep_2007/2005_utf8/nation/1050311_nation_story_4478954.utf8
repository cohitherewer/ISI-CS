 Pak keen on gas pact: Left

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 10: Pakistan has done the groundwork for the proposed gas pipeline project and is ready to sign a trilateral agreement with India and Iran when petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar visits Islamabad on March 18, Left leaders said.

 Harkishen Singh Surjeet and A.B. Bardhan, who returned from Pakistan after a nine-day tour, also highlighted the need to use the pipeline as a confidence-building measure that can lead to lasting peace between the neighbours.

 The two leaders, who are scheduled to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and brief him on their trip, are likely to impress upon him the need to take advantage of the ?conducive atmosphere? to bring about permanent peace with Pakistan.

 The proposed gas pipeline has come to the forefront as a possible bridge in India-Pakistan relations at a time when indications suggest that the US is making all efforts to isolate Iran. 

 There were also reports that Washington has been trying to make the Indian and the Pakistani leaderships aware of its concern over Iran.

 It is not clear yet whether the trilateral agreement will be acceptable to India, which has so far been arguing in favour of separate pacts between it and Iran and another one between Islamabad and Teheran. But Pakistan?s keenness shows that it has not allowed the US to influence it to go slow on the proposed project.

 Although Surjeet and Bardhan met almost all the key political leaders in Pakistan, the highlight of their visit was an hour-long t?te-?-t?te with President Pervez Musharraf.

 ?The meeting with the President was very frank. He was happy with the progress of the confidence-building measures and trade opening up, but asserted that conflict issues also have to be taken up. We cannot avoid any discussion on Kashmir,? the two leaders said.

 The Pakistan President also stressed on the need for India and Pakistan to display ?sincerity, flexibility and courage? in trying to evolve a settlement that was acceptable to both the countries as well as Kashmiris.

 The Left duo said that after the Pakistan trip, they were convinced that leaders of the two countries are capable of resolving the Kashmir conflict amicably without any ?third-party? mediation by the US or any other country.

 The issue of fishermen who stray into each other?s waters, the Baglihar dam and strengthening people-to-people contact were also discussed at their meetings with the Pakistani leadership.

 Impressed and encouraged by the warmth and cordiality they received from all sections of the Pakistani society, Surjeet and Bardhan said both Delhi and Islamabad should take the opportunity of the ?conducive atmosphere? existing between the two countries now and put in their best efforts to improve relations.

 No trial privacy for Salman

 Salman

 Mumbai, June 17: A metropolitan court today rejected actor Salman Khans plea for an in-camera trial in the hit-and-run case. 

 The trial is scheduled to begin from June 30.

 Salmans counsel Dipesh Mehta had filed an application yesterday requesting that the trial be held in-camera to avoid media coverage of the case influencing trial proceedings.

 The court rejected the request, saying an in-camera trial was not justified for the grounds cited by Salman. The additional metropolitan magistrate added such trials were justified in cases of rape, where the identity of victims and witnesses require protection.

 Salman is accused of running over a bakery employee and injuring four in a case of drunken driving in September 2002.

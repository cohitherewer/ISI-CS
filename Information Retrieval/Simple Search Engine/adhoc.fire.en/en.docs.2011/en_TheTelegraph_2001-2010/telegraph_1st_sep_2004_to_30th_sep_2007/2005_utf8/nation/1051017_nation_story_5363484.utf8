 Domestic violence row snares Bedi

New Delhi (PTI): 

A Delhi court has directed IPS officer Kiran Bedi to appear before it in person 

to explain an unauthorised summons allegedly issued by a non-government 

organisation headed by her.

The summons, issued against six persons, accused them 

of domestic violence.

 The court has summoned Bedi on October 22 to explain whether Navjyoti, the NGO run by the Delhi Police Foundation, of which she is founder-general secretary, had the power to issue such an order, allegedly containing threatening language.

 The directive came on a complaint by one Paras Khatri against the NGO, which had allegedly threatened him and his family of action if they did not appear before it to respond to charges of cruelty levelled by Khatris wife.

 Liquor at swipe of card

New Delhi (PTI): 

Customers at select state-owned liquor vends in Delhi can buy their drink using 

credit and debit cards from October 19.

Five vends of the Delhi State Industrial Development 

Corporation (DSIDC) will enable a purchaser to buy liquor with a swipe of the 

cards.

 The facility comes under an arrangement with the ICICI Bank, DSIDC managing director Jalaj Srivastava said, adding that it would be restricted to ICICI card-holders. The move was aimed at helping the customer buy now and pay later, he added.

 The facility will be available at the upmarket DSIDC outlets in Masjid Moth, East of Kailash, Nehru Place, Connaught Place and the Nagrik retail vend opposite Odeon cinema. It will later be extended to other vends.

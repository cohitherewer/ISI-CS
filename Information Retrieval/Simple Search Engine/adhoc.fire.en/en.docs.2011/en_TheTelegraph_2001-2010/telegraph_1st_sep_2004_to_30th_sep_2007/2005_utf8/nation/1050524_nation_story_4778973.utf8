 Cong winks at Laloo, Left plays Cupid

 - Once bitten, the new mantra: secular forces must fight together

 Sonia: Problem at hand 

 New Delhi, May 23: A realignment of political forces appears inevitable in the Bihar elections with the Congress and the Left asserting that secular parties should join hands to prevent a repeat of last times fractured mandate.

 Congress leaders today said there was no way their party could go it alone as they had done in the last polls. As there was little scope for an informal alliance with Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party, a tie-up with Laloo Prasad Yadavs RJD was inevitable, they said.

 Now, it is advantage for the RJD and the rival BJP-Dal (U) combine. The new polls will witness a much sharper Laloo versus anti-Laloo polarisation in which Paswans LJP and the Congress cannot hope to find space for an informal third front as had been the case in the recent polls, a senior AICC leader said.

 Although it will take time for the Congress to firm up its Bihar strategy, AICC general secretary Ambika Soni said there was need for all secular forces to fight the next elections together as there would be a much sharper political polarisation on the ground.

 Sonia Gandhi could authorise senior leaders to interact with our partners in the UPA, get feedback from our state leadership and then firm up our strategy, Soni said.

 The Left, which had a tie-up with Laloo Prasad last time, also said the RJD and the Congress should join hands.

 There is a possibility that the polls may once again throw up a fractured verdict in case these parties do not unite, a leader said.

 The CPM and the CPI have been with Laloo Prasad in the dispute over government formation. They have blamed the Congress for refusing to yield to the RJD to work out a seat-share arrangement for the last polls.

 Congress leaders privately agreed the dissolution was meant to help Laloo Prasad cut his losses as the NDA had been on the verge of splitting Paswans party and staking claim to form the government.

 Laloo Prasad today agreed there was need for a realignment of forces. He said he would try to take the Congress on board ahead of the elections by making liberal seat-share offers. 

 In the elections three months ago, the Congress had distanced itself from the RJD hoping to benefit from anti-incumbency. It had also struck an informal deal with the LJP to attract Dalit votes and wean away anti-RJD upper caste votes that would otherwise have gone to the NDA.

 This time, a new team of Congress leaders, who would be friendlier with Laloo Prasad, is likely to be put in charge of Bihar. State chief Ram Jatan Sinha, a known Laloo-baiter, has already resigned.

 The AICC leader in charge of Bihar affairs, Harikesh Bahadur, is on his way out following the partys dismal poll performance. Sonia is expected to announce the team next month during a proposed AICC revamp.

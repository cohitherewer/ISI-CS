 Shariat reply in notice vacuum

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has constituted a legal committee, tried to lobby the government and spent hours debating how to tell the Supreme Court why Shariat courts should continue functioning. 

 Despite the extensive preparations, the board has not been able to send its formal response to the apex court on a public interest litigation that sought to abolish Shariat courts.

 The reason: the board has still not received the courts formal showcause notices, though two months have passed since the order was issued.

 The court sent notices to the board, the Islamic seminary Dar-ul Uloom, the Centre and the governments of Assam, Bengal, Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh on August 16.

 The notices were in response to a petition filed by lawyer Vishwa Lochan Madan, who sought directives to the board and other respondents to stop the functioning of Shariat courts.

 The petition contended that Shariat courts function as a parallel Muslim judicial system. It said the court should restrain the Dar-ul-qazas from meddling in marital disputes of muslims, especially in the contemporary context of the Imrana case. Imrana was allegedly raped by her father-in-law after which a Shariat court had ordered her divorce saying the relationship with her husband had changed.

 Since August 16, members of the board, chiefly responsible for running Shariat courts, held several meetings and formulated the draft of their response. 

 The broad outlines are: 

 Spell out the exact number of Dar-ul-qazas 

operating in the country

 Clarify how these courts function

 Shariat courts form an important part of the 

alternative disputes redress system in the country and cannot, in any way, be 

described as a parallel judicial system

 The courts complement the judicial system and 

constitutional framework rather than work against them

 Cite instances where regular courts have accepted 

and appreciated the decisions of the Shariat courts

 But how can we send our reply to the Supreme Court? We have not received the notices yet. It is most extraordinary, said board spokesperson Qasim Rasool Iliyas.

 The notice period was eight weeks. But as matters stand now, it might take much longer than that.

 Rice for Orissa on plates in Bengal

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 4: Rice meant for hungry mouths in Orissa is finding its way to plates in West Bengal.

 Days after Balasore police arrested a few truck drivers on charges of diverting rice meant for the food-for-work programme to West Bengal, legislators in the Orissa Assembly today demanded action against Mayurbhanj collector C.T.M. Suguna and another senior official for their alleged involvement in the racket.

 On March 23, at least 256.5 tonnes of rice ? loaded on to 17 trucks ? was seized by police near Mathani Square under Basta police station in Balasore district Led by Balasore superintendent of police Sanjeeb Panda, a team of policemen stopped the trucks to check papers around midnight. Sensing trouble, the drivers of 12 trucks fled. Preliminary investigation revealed that the rice was headed for West Bengal.

 ?The trucks did not have the necessary challans. And after the preliminary investigation, it was found that the rice was originally meant for the food-for-work scheme,? the SP said. 

 Officially, however, 16 truckloads were earmarked for the District Rural Development Agency, Mayurbhanj, and the other for Soro block.

 ?Though records at the Balasore warehouse did not reveal the destination, what fuelled suspicion was the choice of road ? NH 60 instead of NH 5. Besides, none of the trucks had the ?way bill? or challan,? Panda said.

 Following the incident, Suguna had come out in the defence of Mayurbhanj district supply inspector Kailash Chandra Rout, against whose signature the rice was loaded. 

 Raising the issue in the Assembly today, Arun Dey and Raghunath Mohanty ? legislators from Balasore and Basta respectively ? demanded action against the collector and supply inspector for their involvement in the diversion of rice to Bengal.

 Reacting to the allegations, panchayati raj minister Damodar Rout assured the MLAs that investigation into the racket would be over within 24 hours. 

 While admitting that largescale misappropriation existed in the supply of rice meant for below poverty line, mid-day meal, Antyodaya and Annapurna schemes, Rout said steps were afoot to suspend storage agents involved in illegal activities.

 Balasore has emerged as a haven for rice smugglers in the recent past. Police have busted a number of smuggling rackets, most of which involved district officials.

 Sources in the consumer welfare department said at least 10 truckloads of rice meant for various poverty-alleviation schemes are transported from Orissa to various states, particularly Bengal, everyday.

 On July 28 last year, sales tax officials of Balasore had seized six Bengal-bound truckloads of rice on NH 60 near Sales Tax Gate. The rice was distributed under the mid-day meal scheme for Remuna block. 

 Similarly, on October 3, a joint raid by the district administration and sales tax officials resulted in the seizure of eight truckloads of rice on NH 5 and NH 60. In the same month, Jaleswar police seized 52 quintals of rice and arrested two persons.

 On December 10, Basta police seized 374 quintals of rice from three trucks on NH 60, which instead of being transported to Baliapal block, was on its way to Bengal.

 Sources said several quintals of rice meant for BPL cardholders and beneficiaries of Annapurna and Antyodaya schemes are misappropriated every month.

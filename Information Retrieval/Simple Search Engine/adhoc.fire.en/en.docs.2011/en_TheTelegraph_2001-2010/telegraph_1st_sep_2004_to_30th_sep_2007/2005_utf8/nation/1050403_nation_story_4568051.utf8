 Kotla row blame on seat scramble

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 2: Curtains down on the Kotla drama, a Delhi cricket association official today claimed the Indo-Pak one-dayer had never really been off.

 ?I can say with certainty that at no stage was the match off during the past two days of drama,? Vibhakar Shastri, the government?s nominee in the Delhi and District Cricket Association executive, said.

 Hours later, a spokesperson of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi said the civic body had granted permission to the DDCA to hold the match.

 Shastri had attended Thursday?s executive meeting at which sparks had flown on whether it would be possible to host the match.

 DDCA president Arun Jaitley and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit have been working in tandem to ensure the Kotla match goes off smoothly ever since President Pervez Musharraf was invited for it.

 The Musharraf connection triggered a scramble for complimentary passes and tickets within the 5,000-member DDCA. Not only are all members given passes for international matches, they ask for more for relatives and friends.

 The pressure for passes fell directly on Jaitley. That DDCA elections are due next month did not help matters either. Nor did the stringent security concerns for VIPs, which leave little room for flexibility.

 According to a DDCA source, not less than 2,000 seats in the upper tier of the main bloc (pavilion) would have to be left vacant because Musharraf would be seated there. Over a dozen enclosures would have to be set up for corporate leaders as well. Leading houses like Tata and ITC had funded the Kotla renovation.

 All this meant that DDCA members would get that many complimentary passes less.

 ?One top DDCA official who does not see eye to eye with Jaitley was exploiting the situation to corner him,? sources privy to the DDCA meetings on Thursday and Friday said. Jaitley?s outburst after Thursday?s executive meeting was his way of ensuring the pressure from within the DDCA eased, they added.

 Dikshit?s rivals in the Congress, who control the Delhi municipal corporation?s standing committee, made things more difficult by setting stringent security standards. The civic body was reluctant to allow temporary seating arrangements in sections of the stadium where construction of galleries was still going on.

 ?Going by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi?s posture, not more than 15,000 could have been accommodated for the match whereas DDCA planned to accommodate around 28,000,? the sources said.

 It finally took the Prime Minister?s intervention from Mauritius for the civic officials to fall in line.

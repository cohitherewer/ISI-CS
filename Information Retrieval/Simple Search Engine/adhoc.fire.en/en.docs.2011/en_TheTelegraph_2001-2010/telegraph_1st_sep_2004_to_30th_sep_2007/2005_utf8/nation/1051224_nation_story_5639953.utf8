 Poompuhar, Dec. 23: The day the killer waves struck, the elderly village headwoman and a young fishermans wife had reacted in starkly contrasting ways.

 Siva Manimekalai, a 53-year-old high school graduate, had run through the streets screaming warnings as soon as she saw the TV scrolls on the earthquake off Sumatra, helping save hundreds.

 N. Santhakumari, a postgraduate, had almost let the waves get her three-month-old son in her preoccupation to save her research notes.

 Today, both have their place among the handful of heroes thrown up in Tamil Nadu by Black Sunday.

 Manimekalai, the Poompuhar panchayat chief, has won an award from an Italian NGO, Cesvi, for her efforts to help devastated families rebuild their homes and lives.

 Santhakumari, hunched over her papers at home, is penning the first comprehensive sociological work on Nagapattinams fishing community, describing the shattering effect the year-old tragedy continues to have on family ties.

 Did you know that months after the tsunami, child marriages have shot up in our community? asked the housewife from Thoduvai village, who could become the first PhD from among the districts fisherfolk.

 Men who lost their wives and have children to care for are remarrying quickly even before the customary one-year mourning period has passed. With livelihoods affected, parents are marrying off their minor daughters to elderly, widowed males.

 Manimekalais concerns are more mundane. She is fighting to save every paise of assistance to rebuild the flattened homes and put the fishermen back on their feet. She says she hates the tough negotiations with officials, but does it anyway.

 Santhakumari is doing something she feels will help the fishing community advance as a whole ? describing lives across the districts 51 fishing villages.

 I began working on my thesis two years ago, but it almost got derailed by the tsunami, she said.

 In her anxiety to save her notes, painstakingly collected by visiting every village, including jottings about fishermens folk music, she had quite forgotten about her infant son till she realised he was missing.

 But I miraculously found him a day later with one of my relatives at a marriage hall in Sirkali town, 16 km away. I had walked the entire distance searching for my son as buses werent plying.

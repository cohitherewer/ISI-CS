 Sonia makes under-fire Sheila wait

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dikshit: Distanced

 New Delhi, April 22: Some six months ago, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit had shifted from her six-year-old Mathura Road residence to a new bungalow in Lutyen?s Delhi, closer to Sonia Gandhi and 10 Janpath.

 Now, a gulf seems to have opened up between the Congress?s most popular face in Delhi for almost seven years and Sonia. Intense speculation in the party about Sonia?s loss of faith in the chief minister has emboldened Sheila?s detractors and triggered panic in her camp.

 Till a few months ago, Sheila could walk into 10 Janpath at virtually any time. However, for the third day today, she waited for a meeting with the party chief. After walking out in a huff from a meeting of the city Congress leaders on Tuesday, Sheila had sought an appointment with Sonia, memorandum in hand.

 But Sonia is taking her time and not showing any urgency to intervene in the crisis plaguing the Delhi unit. So, the dissident camp led by city chief Ram Babu Sharma, which has stepped up its campaign among party MLAs to isolate Sheila, has also sought a meeting with Sonia.

 The dissident camp, which includes one-time loyalist and city MP Ajay Maken, has prepared a memorandum levelling corruption charges against Sheila and people close to her.

 In what was described as a show of strength at Sheila?s residence today but ostensibly an event to mark Mahavir Jayanti, only 20 of 47 MLAs showed up. That included five of her six ministerial colleagues, most of who came late.

 Sheila fumed at city leaders and some central ones, holding them responsible for fomenting dissidence. Her list of suspects includes AICC general secretaries Ambika Soni and Ashok Gehlot and Sonia?s political secretary Ahmed Patel.

 In a rare TV interview in the middle of the crisis, Sheila declared she would not like to stick to the chief minister?s office as an ?unwelcome guest?. But she insisted she was not upset Sonia had not yet given her a hearing.

 She, however, defended her walkout from the party meeting, saying it had not been called to discuss government functioning.

 Sheila has come under fire at a time when sections of the central leadership are talking about replacing her so that a new leader would have time to prepare to lead the party in the next elections.

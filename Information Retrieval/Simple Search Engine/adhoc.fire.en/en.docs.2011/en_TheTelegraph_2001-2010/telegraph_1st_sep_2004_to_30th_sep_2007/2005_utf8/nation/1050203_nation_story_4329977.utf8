 Nicobar tribals on home hunt 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Around 120 Nicobarese tribals have left a relief camp in Port Blair to identify sites to start reconstruction of their homes in Car Nicobar. 

 While most refugees who had taken shelter in camps on their native island have already selected sites for their new habitation, some families that were evacuated to the capital have not yet finalised their new location. Most wish to move further inland, abandoning villages by the sea, after the December 26 tsunami decimated the region.

 ?The tribal captains wanted to go back to start the process of resettlement on Car Nicobar,? lieutenant governor Ram Kapse told over phone from Port Blair.

 Their return will also help the authorities arrive at the exact number of habitations that will be needed on the island, after which the administration will provide material and implements to start construction.

 Currently, there are over 1,000 Nicobarese tribals at the main ITF camp in Port Blair, and others at the Nirmala school camp, while most are in the 175-odd camps at Car Nicobar. 

 The refugees are being encouraged to return to their island to hasten the return to normality. Shelters are scheduled to come up before the arrival of monsoon. There has been some resistance, so far, on returning due to apprehensions about accommodation and living conditions on Car Nicobar.

 Talks have also been held between the government and the tribal council on whether they would construct traditional-style structures or earthquake resistant ones. The tribal council presented a memorandum regarding rehabilitation, saving coconut plantations and employment that has been approved by the administration.

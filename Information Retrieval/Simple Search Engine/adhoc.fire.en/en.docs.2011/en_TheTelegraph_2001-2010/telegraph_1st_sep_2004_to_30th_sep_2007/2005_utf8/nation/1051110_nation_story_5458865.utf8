 Bandit separated, in death too

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gujjar, Seema: Rites denied

 Lucknow, Nov. 9: So what if they had been separated for the last 10 years? She was, after all, his first and legally wedded wife.

 But Seema Parihars argument ? and tears ? did not wash as Uttar Pradesh police handed over slain bandit leader Nirbhay Gujjars body to his sister Rama Devi who cremated him today near his village in Aurriya district.

 Denied, Seema sat on dharna in front of the district magistrates office in Aurriya. I might have been separated from my husband for the way he had treated me. After me, three other women claimed to be his wife, but I was the one who was his legally wedded wife, the 40-year-old, caught up in a sudden surge of emotion for her dead husband, told reporters between sobs.

 So I should have been given the body so that I and my son could cremate him and perform his last rites.

 Seema, who had floated her own gang after separating from Nirbhay, surrendered in March last year. She has also acted in Wounded, a film on her life and now lives with her son. Nirbhay is believed to be the father.

 Akhil Kumar, the police officer who spearheaded Monday nights raid that ended the notorious dacoits nearly 20-year run, said there are too many who claimed to be his wives. Which wife should we choose as genuine?

 Informed sources said by claiming the body, Seema may have been trying to stake claim to the bandits property, if there was any.

 While Seema and some of Nirbhays associates are believed to be out to grab his ill-begotten wealth, the Congress demanded a probe into the assets the dacoit might have accumulated over the years.

 Where are the properties of the dacoit and who are trying to get control of that? We demand a probe into this, said Pramod Tiwari, the chief of the Congress Legislative Party in Uttar Pradesh.

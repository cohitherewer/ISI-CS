 Sikhs seethe at mockery

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: She was just nine when Babli learnt that her father would never come back home again.

 Twenty-one years have passed since Sanwal Singh was killed by a mob near his house in East Delhis Trilokpuri, but his daughter has not forgotten that day.

 I hope people like H.K.L. Bhagat go even more mad. Their children should thirst for their fathers love as much as we suffered, says Babli, now a young woman of nearly 30.

 That Bhagat ? once known as the uncrowned king of Delhi ? has sunk into disease is, perhaps, poetic justice for all those like Babli who lost a father or others who saw their husband or sons butchered before their own eyes.

 But justice was the last thing on their minds after the Nanavati commissions report was tabled in Parliament today.

 Minutes after the report was tabled, Sikh anger spilled on to the streets of Tilak Vihar, the largest resettlement colony in New Delhi for the victims of the 1984 riots. Many called the report a mockery.

 We had given three names ? (Jagdish) Tytler, Sajjan Kumar and H.K.L. Bhagat. But they could not even punish them. If the people who killed Indira Gandhi got death, shouldnt these people who killed so many sardars get the same? We had so much hope on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but it looks as if he has come under pressure, says Babli.

 There are no men in my house, says 60-year-old Bhoji Bai, who saw her husband and three sons killed by their neighbours. This report is not justice. We got Rs 3 lakh after all the suffering we went through. My house is full of little children and I have to struggle to bring them up. Is this what I should be doing in my old age?

 When a sardar dies, a dog dies. When a Hindu dies, a king dies. That is what this government is trying to tell us, says another angry survivor.

 In Chandigarh, Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal slammed the Congress-led governments action taken report on the Nanavati commissions findings. The former Punjab chief ministers target was Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

 Badal said Sonia should put her hand across her heart and swear by any faith she believes in to say that in her honest opinion, senior leaders of her party did not instigate the rioters.

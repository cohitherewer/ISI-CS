 Bid bar on SA arms firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 6: South African arms manufacturer Denel has been barred by the Indian government from participating in a competition to bid for an order of artillery guns. The army will hold a fourth round of trials in high-altitude conditions and in the Rajasthan desert.

 The Indian artillery order is expected to be worth more than Rs 12,000 crore after the army projected the need for 180 wheeled and 120 tracked 155mm/52 calibre howitzers that are planned to be inducted by 2010. The armys main artillery gun is the Swedish Bofors that was inducted in 1987 and there has been no upgradation of the artillery since then.

 Last month, vice-chief of army staff Lt General S. Pattabhiraman said the decision on whether Denel, whose sale of anti-materiel rifles to the army is being investigated by the CBI, can participate in the fresh trials will have to be taken by the government. Army headquarters has now been told that Denel should not be invited.

 This leaves the Israeli company Soltam and SWS Defence, the current holding company of Bofors, the only ones in the fray from the old competitors. But army sources say it is possible that other European manufacturers will make a bid, among whom is the French company Giat.

 The army sources had said the effective ban on Denel imposed in June was a setback to its artillery modernisation programme. Denels G-5/2000 was in contention for the order. 

 The artillery trials will be held near Leh in February for testing in peak winter conditions and in the Rajasthan desert in May-June for testing in peak summer.

 Army commanders who met for the second bi-annual conference in Delhi last month expressed concern over delay in implementing the artillery modernisation programme. The army now relies almost entirely on the Bofors 155 howitzers that are ageing. Even during the Kargil war, when the guns proved such an asset for the army, it had to cannibalise components to keep the howitzers firing.

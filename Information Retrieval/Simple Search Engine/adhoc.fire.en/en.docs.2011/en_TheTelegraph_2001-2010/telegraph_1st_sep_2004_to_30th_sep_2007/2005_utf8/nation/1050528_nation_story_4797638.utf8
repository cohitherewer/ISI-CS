 Talks weigh Siachen options

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 27: Pakistani and Indian defence officials today failed to break the impasse over demilitarisation of Siachen as their two-day talks came to a close.

 Defence secretary Ajai Vikram Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Tariq Waseem Ghazi led their respective delegations to the talks held in the garrison town of Rawalpindi.

 A joint statement issued at the end of the meet said officials have decided to continue discussions for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.

 They also agreed to carry on with the ceasefire, which has been in place in the 21,000-ft glacier since November 2003.

 Ghazi said the two sides discussed several options for resolving the deadlock amicably and tried to understand each others points of view on technical aspects of the impasse.

 Singh said that never before have the two sides discussed so many options. He added: We hope the two countries will soon reach an understanding to resolve the problem.

 The Indian defence secretary said the discussions would continue when the delegations meet again in Delhi. However, he did not reveal when the next round of talks would be held.

 Siachen is one of the eight items on the agenda of the composite dialogue, which the two countries had begun in February 2004.

 Pakistan wants the withdrawal of troops from Siachen on the basis of the 1972 Simla Agreement, while India wants their deployment on present positions authenticated.

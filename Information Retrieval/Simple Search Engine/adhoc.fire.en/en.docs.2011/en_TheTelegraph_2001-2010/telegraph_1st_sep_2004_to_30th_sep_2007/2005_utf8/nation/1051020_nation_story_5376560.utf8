 Uri, Oct. 19: They had helped win the Kargil war, advancing surefooted up the treacherous mountains amid enemy gunfire, losing personnel all the way.

 Now the Indian Army again has reason to be grateful to them as they render yeoman service, trudging up and down the destroyed roads to carry succour to Kashmirs earthquake victims.

 The only advantage they have over the ordinary soldier is an extra pair of legs.

 Much of the praise the army has gained over the past 10 days, successfully reaching relief to remote quake-ravaged villages, is due to the Mountain Artillery Mules, admit soldiers as well as the victims.

 We are happily delivering aid ? tents, clothes and food ? to the affected population in the two worst-hit villages of Kamalkote and Sultan Daki near the Line of Control (LoC), mule driver G.S.R. Bhai told The Telegraph.

 A good share of the appreciation the Indian Army has earned for its quick response, and its role in launching rescue and relief operations, belongs to these mules, said a resident of Sultan Daki.

 The army pressed the mules into service immediately after the earthquake struck and the mountain roads and paths vanished, pushing mechanised transport out of the picture. The animals round-the-clock efforts amid rain and snow have won them the average soldiers respect and admiration.

 Its a soldiers duty to help suffering humanity, Subedar Kunji Lal Patels tone was solemn. These mules have been working long hours in difficult terrain.

 In war and in peacetime, the mules have served the army well. 

 During the two-month Kargil war in mid-1999, 18 of the animals laid down their lives, while about 100 were injured as they ferried pieces of artillery and ammunition up the rugged mountains to frontline army pickets. 

 They repeated the act through Operation Parakram, when the two armies were eyeball-to-eyeball following the attack on Parliament.

 Girl breaks VIP cordon for family

 Lucknow (PTI): A 17-year-old girl created 

 a flutter when she broke the security cordon at a function 

 of President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and handed him a memorandum 

 to save her family land.

 Archana managed to pass through 

 the security ring at Rudahi hamlet in the district, went 

 up the dais and handed over the memorandum, alleging that 

 her family?s land had been usurped by the village head and 

 that her father faced a death threat.

 As she was being promptly removed by district magistrate Aradhana Shukla and security personnel, Archana kept shouting that her father would be killed and that her family land had been usurped by village pradhan Nidesh Pal Singh Yadav. District authorities tried to assure Archana that her grievances would be redressed but she insisted on having an audience with the President.

 The episode briefly interrupted the function.

 Ironically, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, in his welcome address, had praised the pradhan for successfully organising the event.

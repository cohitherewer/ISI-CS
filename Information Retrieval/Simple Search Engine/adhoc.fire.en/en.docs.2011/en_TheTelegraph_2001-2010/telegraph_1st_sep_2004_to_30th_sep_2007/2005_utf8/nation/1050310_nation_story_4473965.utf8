 Crime greets central rule

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 9: Crime is back in Bihar, well and truly.

 To begin with, the capital?s seniormost orthopaedist and retired professor of Patna Medical College and Hospital, R.C. Ram, has allegedly received an extortion threat for Rs. 50 lakh.

 Vijay Shankar Singh, president of the Bihar unit of the Indian Medical Association, said the association has written to the governor, director-general of police and senior superintendent of police about the threat.

 Ram, who stays in the Kankarbag locality and runs Ram Ratan Hospital, has filed a case with Patrakar Nagar police station in the capital. 

 Bhojpur district has witnessed a spurt in crimes, said to be the aftermath of the elections. Alleged Ranvir Sena activists today killed at least two Dalits and injured four, including three women, at Charpokhri village in Piro subdivision. 

 The Dalits belonged to the same family and were supporters of the CPI(ML). The Ranvir Sena is believed to have targeted the family for the refusal of its members to vote for a certain upper caste candidate.

 Similar attacks on Dalits have been reported from Gopalganj and Mokamah in Patna district.

 CPI(ML) state secretary Ram Jathan Sharma blamed the upper castes as well as the Rashtriya Janata Dal for the incidents. ?These forces are frustrated today?they are trying to create tension in society. Above all, they can?t stand the fact that Dalits have come out and voted against them,? he said.

 Tension continued to run high today in the Hassan Bazaar area of Piro, where an incident of alleged eve-teasing yesterday led to the death of two people.

 According to sources, some Dalit Musahars of Hassan Bazaar objected to a Yadav youth teasing a girl while drinking country liquor yesterday morning. A fight ensued and a Yadav was killed. Later, residents of the deceased youth?s village returned to the Musahar bustee and killed one person and set fire to most of the huts.

 Police registered a case against unnamed people and were yet to arrest anyone.

 In another incident, suspected Maoists abducted 10 villagers of Sadokhar and Kurmu villages under Chenari police station in Rohtas district yesterday, while they were on their way to Gupt Dham shrine on the occasion of Shivratri.

 The abductors, who later released six villagers, allegedly shot dead one and left another, a teacher, critically injured today. Police are conducting raids to find the culprits.

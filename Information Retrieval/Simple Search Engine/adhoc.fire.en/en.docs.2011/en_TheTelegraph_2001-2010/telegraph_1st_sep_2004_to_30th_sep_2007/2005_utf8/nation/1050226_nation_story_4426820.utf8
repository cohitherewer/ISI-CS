 Sonia crows on coalition dharma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has asserted that the party, the leading partner in the ruling United Progressive Alliance, has followed coalition dharma to ensure cohesive functioning of the Manmohan Singh government.

 ?We in the Congress have been very sensitive to the challenges of running a coalition government, accommodating diverse points of view to ensure its cohesive functioning,? Sonia said while addressing the Congress parliamentary party here this evening.

 The Congress president?s assertion came in the wake of railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav?s complaint that the party lacked experience in running a coalition government ? a criticism also voiced by CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan.

 The coalition has worked well during the past nine months, contrary to the expectations of ?our detractors?, Sonia said and assured that the party would remain sensitive to accommodating different points of view to ensure that the government runs smoothly.

 Sonia said the President?s address earlier in the day had laid out the agenda for governance by the Congress-led alliance for the next year and hoped Monday?s budget would reflect the commitments of the party?s election manifesto.

 She said she had detailed discussions with the Prime Minister on giving effect to the party?s pledges in areas such as elementary education, employment, health and farmers? welfare.

 Sonia drew the attention of ministers to the complaints made against them by party workers. ?They are simply unable to get access to our ministers,? she said, asking them to be mindful of their responsibilities towards party workers and organisational leaders.

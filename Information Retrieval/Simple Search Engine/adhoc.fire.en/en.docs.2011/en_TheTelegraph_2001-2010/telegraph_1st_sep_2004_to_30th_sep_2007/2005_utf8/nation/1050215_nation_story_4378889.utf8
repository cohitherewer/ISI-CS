 Patna, Feb. 14: Bihar?s flood zone, where people seem to have forgotten the tribulations they faced a few months ago, goes to polls tomorrow in the second and crucial phase of the Assembly elections.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal led by Laloo Prasad Yadav has much at stake in this round as it holds 52 of the 82 seats that would be up for grabs.

 Elections were originally scheduled for 86 seats but polling in some constituencies was later deferred.

 The second phase would be crucial for the RJD and a major loss in this round could eventually diminish its hopes of returning to power. 

 The stakes are equally high for the Congress, Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party and the NDA, the other major players. A large number of rebels from the RJD and the BJP are also in the fray.

 In eastern districts like Kishanganj, Purnea and Madhepura, the RJD?s traditional Muslim-Yadav support base is on an open test.

 On the other hand, the Congress has sharpened its reluctant opposition to the RJD in this round and the two parties are pitted against each other in 19 constituencies. 

 AICC president Sonia Gandhi, during her campaign in this phase, has raised the issues of development and poor law and order with a greater force.

 The backward Mithila region ? comprising districts like Madhubani, Darbhanga and Saharsa, which bore the brunt of the floods ? will go to polls tomorrow and the RJD looks confident of retaining most of its seats in the zone.

 The impact of the ?revolt? by jailed RJD parliamentarian Pappu Yadav would also be on test. So will be the reputation of Union minister Mohammad Taslimuddin, who is believed to have an influence among Muslim voters.

 If the threat of Naxalite violence loomed large over the first phase of elections on February 3, the second round is marked by the direct or indirect presence of a large number of notorious figures, sprinkled across the 15 districts where polling would be held.

 Posters and CDs on the Godhra episode hogged the limelight in the run-up to the second phase tomorrow. While Laloo Prasad initially claimed that the Election Commission did not have any problem with the allegedly ?inflammatory? CDs, his party later denied having any role in the controversy. 

 The RJD, concerned over reports of Muslim voters looking for options, is believed to have circulated the CDs, inviting the wrath of the NDA.

 Sources in the state election office said ?unprecedented? security arrangements have been made for tomorrow and shoot-at-sight orders have been issued. ?Any civilian carrying a gun is liable to be shot. This is a new directive,? the sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Centre clears air on 

Maoists

 PRANAY SHARMA AND J. HEMANTH

 New Delhi/Kathmandu, May 26: India today made clear there was no military solution to the rebellion racking Nepal even as a top Maoist ideologue in the Himalayan kingdom slammed what he said were sinister attempts to project him as Delhis stooge.

 In a two-page statement released from his hideout, Baburam Bhattarai said reports that Indian intelligence agencies arranged meetings between him and Left leaders in Delhi were sensational, baseless and ill-intended and were an attempt at character assassination.

 Delhis stand on a political settlement has come in this backdrop of allegations of Maoist links and in the wake of an audio-tape the Royal Nepal Army made public, claiming it was a conversation between two Maoist leaders about their Indian connection.

 The RNA had brushed aside requests from the Indian embassy to play the tape before it was released, making it clear that King Gyanendras instruction was to embarrass India. It is our conviction that there is no purely military solution to the Maoist insurgency, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said, an assertion analysts said was an attempt to put some pressure back on Gyanendra to restore democracy.

 But the foreign ministry also clarified its stand on the armed rebels. There is no change in respect of our policy with regard to the CPN (Maoists). We unequivocally condemn their terrorist and violent activities that have caused enormous suffering to the people of Nepal, Sarna said.

 Durable peace and stability in Nepal can only be achieved through a political settlement, which, among other things, requires the Maoists to forswear armed struggle and law down their arms.

 India, the spokesman added, is committed to supporting all efforts at restoring peace, political stability and economic prosperity in Nepal.

 Asked about reports that security agencies had arranged for a meeting between Bhattarai and CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, the spokesman referred to the press statement issued by the Left leader. Karat today said no such meeting was held. A few days earlier, CPI leader A.B. Bardhan, too, had denied meeting Bhattarai.

 Bhattarai, on his part, said it was ridiculous to imply that Delhi was trying to negotiate with Maoist top boss Prachanda who, the RNA had claimed, had stripped the ideologue of his party post for opposing the party line on several critical issues. To try to present somebody as a stooge of foreigners just because of ideological, political differences is height of political degeneration, Bhattarai said.

 In the audio recording a man, who the RNA claims was Prachanda, says Delhi promised to release jailed Maoist leaders Mohan Baidya alias Kiran and C.P. Gajurel alias Gaurav if Bhattarai is reinstated as number two in his party.

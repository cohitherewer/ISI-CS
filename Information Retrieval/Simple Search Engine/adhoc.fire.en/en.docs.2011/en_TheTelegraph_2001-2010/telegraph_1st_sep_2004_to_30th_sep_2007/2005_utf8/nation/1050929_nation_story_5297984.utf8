 Damages bill to Coke

 Nagpur, Sept. 28 (PTI): The Maharashtra Disputes Redressal Commission has directed the Coca-Cola bottling plant here to deposit Rs 17,000 with the district consumer forum as compensation for alleged impurities found in a bottle.

 The district forum recently held Coca-Cola deficient in service on a complaint that a bottle of the soft drink contained adulterated substances. Government laboratories found the drink to be unfit for human consumption.

 A Nagpur resident approached the forum charging Coca-Cola bottlers, Superior Drinks Private Ltd, and Balaji Sales, an agent, for marketing and selling adulterated food as defined in the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act 1954. 

 He demanded Rs 4 lakh as compensation. The district forum slapped a collective fine of Rs 1 lakh on Coca-Cola but the company challenged the findings. The state commission then told it to deposit Rs 17,000, staying the forums order.

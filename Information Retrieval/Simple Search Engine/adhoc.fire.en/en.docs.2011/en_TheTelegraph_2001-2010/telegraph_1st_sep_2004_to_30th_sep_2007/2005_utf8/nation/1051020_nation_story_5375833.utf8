 Scanner on Laloo judge transfer

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Supreme Court today said it would closely scrutinise the documents relating to the transfer of designated CBI judges trying fodder scam cases in Patna against Laloo Prasad Yadav and his wife Rabri Devi. 

 The court also said it would pose queries, if any, to Patna High Court as a high court was the final authority to act on government recommendation to promote and transfer a trial judge in a state.

 The observation followed the allegation that Laloo Prasad was influencing the trial with the promotions and transfers. 

 The court had earlier sought the documents on the petition of Janata Dal (U) leader Rajiv Ranjan Lallan and BJPs Sushil Modi alleging that Laloo Prasad and Rabri were using their political clout. 

 The court said it would scrutinise the documents received from the high court relating to the promotion and transfer of four judges who were trying the cases against the railway minister and his wife, the former Bihar chief minister. 

 The latest to be promoted and transferred was Yogendra Prasad and Munni Lal Paswan has been designated in his place.

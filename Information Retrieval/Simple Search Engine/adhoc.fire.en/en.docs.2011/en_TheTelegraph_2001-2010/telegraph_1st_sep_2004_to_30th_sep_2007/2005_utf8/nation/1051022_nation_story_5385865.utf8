The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 City hit

 Calcutta, Oct. 21: With the onion supply from Nashik drying up, prices are spiralling in the city and suburbs. 

 From Rs 10-12 a kg on Friday, wholesale prices in some of the biggest markets now range between Rs 18.75 and Rs 20 a kg. In the retail market, the prices have shot up from Rs 12-15 to Rs 20-24 a kg.

 The reason for the increase is the shortage in Nashik, where most of our supply comes from, said Manik Singh, a wholesaler in Burrabazars Posta market.

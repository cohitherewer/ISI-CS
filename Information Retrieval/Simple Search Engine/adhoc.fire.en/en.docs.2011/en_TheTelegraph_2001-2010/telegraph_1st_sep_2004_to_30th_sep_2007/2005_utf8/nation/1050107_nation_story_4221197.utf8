 Posco deal inches closer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Jamshedpur, Jan. 6: Negotiations with Posco of South Korea, which is interested in setting up a steel plant in Orissa, have reached an advanced stage, said S.N. Dash, joint secretary in the steel ministry here.

 Dash, who was here on a two-day visit with a seven-member team to assess the performance of Tata Steel for the Prime Minister?s trophy, left for Rourkela in the afternoon.

 Officials of the Orissa government and the steel ministry recently visited South Korea to discuss the modalities with Posco, informed Dash.

 The South Korean steel major, he said, plans to set up the plant in two phases, with production capacity of 6 million tonnes in each phase. 

 The estimated investment by Posco alone is to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore, he pointed out.

 The upbeat joint secretary said that high-quality iron-ore reserves in Orissa had attracted investment proposals worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore. 

 Negotiations with various other companies were in different stages and it would not be prudent to disclose their names at this stage, he added. They however include companies from China and Japan.

 Once these global giants set up their plants in Orissa, they together would be producing 40 million tonnes of steel, he pointed out.

 Several of these companies have also evinced interest in the mining sector, he hinted. The proposals include mining operations as well as production units.

 With the South Korean company allaying fears of relocating its proposed steel plant to Brazil, the Orissa government has gone all out to woo it.

 Bengal fails school test

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The Centre is unhappy with the Bengal government for neglecting the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a countrywide programme to bring primary education to all children.

 A large number of children in the 6-14 age-group have been reported to be out of school (approximately 9 lakh in April 2005), the Union human resource development ministry has said in a note to the state government.

 Even a state like Bihar has managed to get its act together, but not Bengal, an official involved with the Abhiyan said. 

 The Centres assessment of Bengals performance reads like a poor report card: the state has not made use of all the funds, has failed to hire enough teachers and has defaulted on the midday meal scheme.

 Under the scheme, 73,536 teachers should have been hired; Bengal has hired only 17,000. At the beginning, it appointed only para-teachers instead of full-fledged, qualified teachers. Under an avalanche of criticism, in which leading academics like Jean Dreze joined in, the state government stopped the practice but still refused to hire enough teachers.

 We shall foot 75 per cent of the salary bill, a central official said. Yet the state hasnt made any recruitments under the Abhiyan.

 The slow progress of civil works continues to be a matter of concern, the ministry note said. 

 Of the total of 41.3 per cent of works sanctioned, only 29.8 per cent were completed. Almost 25 per cent of the works have not been started.

 Expenditures against approved outlays have been low in the SSA and District Primary Education Programme. Calcutta has not been covered though the state had said the midday meal scheme would be universalised throughout the state by February this year.

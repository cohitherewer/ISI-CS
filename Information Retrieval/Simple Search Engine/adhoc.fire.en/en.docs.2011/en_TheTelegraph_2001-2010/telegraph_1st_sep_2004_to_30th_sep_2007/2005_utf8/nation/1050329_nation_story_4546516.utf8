 Nanavati report 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 28: The United Progressive Alliance government will table the Nanavati commission report in the second half of the budget session and meet the BJP?s demand that the panel?s recommendations be placed in the House soon.

 The BJP has been demanding that G.T. Nanavati?s two-volume, 1,805-page report be made public ever since the retired Supreme Court judge submitted it to Union home minister Shivraj Patil last month.

 Officials question Opposition criticism that the Centre has taken too long to table the report in Parliament. They argue that the government was, by law, entitled to take up to six months to table the commission?s findings along with an action-taken report.

 The Nanavati commission had been appointed by the National Democratic Alliance government to probe into the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 that followed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi?s assassination. 

 The NDA, of which the Akali Dal is a part, had set up the panel largely to suit its constituency among Sikh organisations, which alleged that Congress leaders were involved in the riots that had rocked the capital.

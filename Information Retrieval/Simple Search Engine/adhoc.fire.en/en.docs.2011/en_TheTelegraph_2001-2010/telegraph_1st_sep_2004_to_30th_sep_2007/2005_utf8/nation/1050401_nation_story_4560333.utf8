 SC sticks to fast court guns

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 31: The Supreme Court today said providing speedy justice to citizens was a constitutional obligation of states and cited this as the main reason for extending the tenure of 1,734 fast-track courts till April 30. 

 While justifying the order it had passed yesterday, a bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia also said the apex court would ask the government to continue with the fast-track courts if no money had been allocated for their survival.

 The courts were set up in 2001 as about 2.5 crore criminal cases were pending in various normal courts across the country and many undertrials were languishing in jail for years ? some of them more than the actual term of what their punishment would have entailed.

 The case of Bengal?s Ajay Ghosh was an eye opener. He was the longest imprisoned undertrial in the history of independent India, having spent 37 years in jail, from 1962 to 1999.

 The judges said the right of undertrials to ?speedy justice is equal to right to life?, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. 

 In this context, ?speedy justice was an obligation on the part of the state?, the Supreme Court added, and pointed out that if the courts were ?suddenly? closed down now, ?it would result in chaos?.

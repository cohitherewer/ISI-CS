 Sleuths in the dark

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: The Enforcement Directorate questioned Andaleeb Sehgal for the second day today on alleged involvement in payment of illegal surcharges to the Iraq government in the oil-for-food programme.

 Directorate sources said not much substantive evidence has yet emerged from the interrogation to warrant further proceedings.

 Sehgal was questioned for almost seven hours by a team headed by special director S.K. Panda. His partner Vikas Dhar was also quizzed. Sehgal had denied all charges against his company, Hamadan Exports, in a statement issued on Sunday.

 Officials said they are trying to establish whether there was any violation of export remittance norms and the income-tax act, in which case the RBI and the tax department would have to deal with the matter. Such cases are considered routine for export firms and not considered major offences. 

 The officials said the other Indian companies mentioned in the report might be asked to clarify whether any economic law was broken. But no formal probe is expected. The Volcker report has named over 120 Indian companies.

 The Tatas today said Tata International, one of the companies named in the report, had no reason to believe that fees imposed by Iraqi authorities on goods supplied to them was illegal or illicit.

 A Tata International spokesperson said the company had not received any communication from the UN or its committee in this regard, adding that all contracts were approved by the UN committee monitoring the oil-for-food programme.

 In the year 2000, the Iraqi authorities had imposed inland transportation fees and after-sales services fees on all contracts. Tata International had no reason to believe there was anything illegal or illicit in such payments, the spokesperson said.

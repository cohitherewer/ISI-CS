 Goswami: Waiting to go

 Patna, Dec. 31: Controversial Patna district magistrate Gautam Goswami, keen to work for a corporate house as its senior vice-president, today sent his resignation to the state government but there was no word from the authorities on its fate.

 Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramaniam confirmed that he has received a copy of Goswami?s resignation ? addressed to the personnel secretary ? but said no decision has been taken. The IAS officer has assigned no reason for his resignation.

 Goswami, under the Election Commission?s scanner for failing to check the alleged violation of the model code of conduct in the wake of RJD?s December 23 rally (later called off), had applied to the government for a three-year lien for joining the corporate house. 

 But his request was rejected and so was his application for leave, after which the poll panel asked the 1991 batch IAS officer to continue in office. By virtue of his office, Goswami also happens to be the returning officer of the district.

 Goswami?s lien application was unique because it was, perhaps, the first instance in the country when a serving IAS officer wanted to work for a private company without resigning.

 A senior IAS officer said, ?The resignation has to be accepted by the government before an official can be relieved from service. If any government servant relinquishes charge on his own before the acceptance of his resignation, he is liable to be prosecuted under the service rules. In such a case, he will obviously lose the benefits that would be otherwise available to him.?

 Goswami had cancelled his weeklong leave from December 24 on the directives of the commission.

 His eagerness to work for a corporate house while being in service made some IAS officers feel it was a compromise with ?neutrality?, a basic tenet of bureaucracy.

 The IAS officer, understood to be handpicked by Laloo Prasad Yadav to be the Patna district magistrate, first shot into limelight when he stopped the speech of L.K. Advani, then deputy Prime Minister, seconds before the 10-pm deadline was to expire. In his capacity as the returning officer, he had climbed the stage at Gandhi Maidan and requested Advani to stop speaking during the campaign for the Lok Sabha elections.

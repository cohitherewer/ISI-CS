 SC tax blow on goods transport

New Delhi: The Supreme Court has upheld a central law imposing 

service tax on those availing services of goods transport operators and forwarding 

and clearing agents, reports our legal correspondent.

 All industries transporting goods through trucks or transport operators and individuals transporting household goods from one city to another have to pay this tax at 10 per cent.

 A division bench of Justices Ruma Pal and Arun Kumar, which upheld the law, dismissed a batch of about 40 petitions challenging imposition of the tax on the person whose goods are being transported rather than on the transporter. The judges said the government had legislative competence and powers to enact such a law.

 Transporters had held a countrywide strike in 2000 protesting the tax initially imposed on them. Subsequently, the Centre amended the law in the Finance Act, 2000, so that the ?consumer? (the person or industry whose goods are transported) and not the service provider paid the tax.

 The petitioners contended that in all other fields of trade, the service provider paid the service tax and the law imposing tax on the service user was ?discriminatory?.

 But the court held that the legislature enjoyed a large discretion in the classification of tax regime and the courts should be ?extremely circumspect on questioning the reasonability of such classification?.

 Sonia takes a cool break

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, June 23: After the heat and dust of Tonk, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has decided to chill out for a while.

 Well-placed Congress sources said Sonia will set off for Himachal Pradesh on a four-day holiday, which begins on Saturday. She will be accompanied by her daughter Priyanka son-in-law Robert Vadra and her two grandchildren. Son Rahul is away in the US.

 Sonia and her family will vacation in a tony resort, which is 15 km from Shimla between Kufri and Chail. The fashionable address has a seven-hole golf blade, a zoological park and a musk deer breeding farm in its vicinity.

 Sources said the Congress president was keen on a break to spend quality time with her grandchildren before plunging again in the hurly-burly of party matters.

 Once she returns, Sonia will have her hands full fine-tuning the cabinet shuffle/expansion, effecting changes in the Congress organisation, appointing state Congress chiefs and deciding when she should convene a meeting of the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states.

 When Sonia wants time to herself and her family, she usually retreats to Kausani in Uttaranchals Almora district where a close family friend of the Gandhis, Suman Dubey, has a cottage.

 Himachal Pradesh is Atal Bihari Vajpayees favourite holiday destination. The former Prime Minister heads for Manali whenever he gets sentimental and poetic or is in a mood to tuck into Italian cuisine cooked by an Italian lady who owns a tiny eatery.

 China bid to repair image with Dalai home

 Lhasa, June 14: Qiangba Gesang is one of the happiest men in Tibet today. His is a job that the world closely watches. As he sits in his office in Potala Palace, relaxed and smiling, he knows that he has a happy message to send out to the world.

 His job, though, has nothing to do with the religion and politics that the world associates with the Dalai Lamas official residence. In fact, he is an atheist, he says, and simply loves his work.

 For the past 15 years, his has been one of the most important jobs in Tibet ? or in China, for that matter. And he knows that his job is, above all, a political statement. For whatever happens to the Potala has great consequences for Chinese politics and diplomacy.

 Qiangba is the director of the Potalas administrative department. He is thus responsible for the biggest repairs in its history. He is a happy man because only on Saturday the men completed the most difficult part of the repairs ? of the 7th century palaces foundation.

 It has been a formidable challenge. Only one worker could go at a time down the 17-metre-deep tunnel that led to the 1,30,000-square-metre foundation area to reinforce it.

 It isnt the only difficult part of the work, though. Take, for example, the huge stupa of the fifth Dalai Lama. Only two wooden pillars support the 11.5-metre beam in the hall.

 As they worked on, the repairmen discovered hitherto unknown rooms and alleys. 

 Parts of the palace had been repaired earlier between 1989 and 1994 at a cost of 53 million yuan. So far, 176 million yuan have been spent on the current repairs.

 But the current repairs, which began in 2002 and are to be completed in 2007, are the biggest in its history. Once these are completed, the government estimates, the Potala may not require major repairs in another 50 years.

 Qiangbas worries, however, did not stop at the construction difficulties. He, like the Chinese government, had to fight international scepticism along the way.

 He recalls that former President Jiang Zemin had visited the palace during the first phase of repairs. Hu Jintao, his successor, took a personal interest in seeing that the right kind of timber was sent for the repairs.

 The Chinese clearly are keen to tell the world that they are serious about preserving Tibets ancient religion and culture. It is politically important for them to send this message out to a world that is critical of China on the Dalai Lama issue and on the human rights situation in Tibet.

 But Qiangbas is a specific mission in the Chinese strategy. The Unesco was concerned that the modern construction techniques and material would damage the structure. 

 But when a three-member Unesco team came to see the repairs last May, it was convinced that we were sticking to the technique and material that were used in the original construction. 

 It was also rumoured that its precious collection of Buddhist scriptures would be damaged. A Danish diplomat who shared this view came visiting recently and went away satisfied with our care of the Potalas treasures, including the scriptures.

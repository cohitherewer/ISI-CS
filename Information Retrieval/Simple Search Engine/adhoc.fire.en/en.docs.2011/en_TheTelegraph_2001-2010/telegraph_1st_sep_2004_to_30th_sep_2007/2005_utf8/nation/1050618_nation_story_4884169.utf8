 VHP back on temple track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 17: Disillusioned with the BJP and L.K. Advani, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has decided to take the temple campaign in its hands.

 Hundreds of sadhus, who had gone to Hardwar to attend a three-day VHP meet, returned to Ayodhya this morning, vowing to get the temple construction back on track.

 The sants met to discuss the fallout of the Hardwar session. The buzzword here is: no reliance on BJP, let us go alone now, one of them said.

 The VHP today decided to hold six dharma sansads in holy cities like Ayodhya, Hardwar, Kashi, Joshimath, Varanasi and Vindhyachal. These sansads will discuss the new course of action in Ayodhya, besides making workers aware of the legal, moral and philosophical principles of the temple campaign.

 The VHP has decided to give the temple movement a new lease of life and take its tempo to the level that existed before the Babri Masjid was brought down in 1992.

 The Babri Masjid demolition was a mission to bring down the tainted structure. The new mission would be to build the temple, VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma said this evening from Ayodhya.

 The VHP, which suffered a setback after differences surfaced with the Akhara Parishad, is trying to mend the cracks by calling upon the heads of over 1,000 akharas to join the movement.

 On the mission of temple construction, there is no difference, and the Akhara Parishad will come forward, said Sharma.

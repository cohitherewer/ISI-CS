 Israel rethink on Lakshya order

Bangalore: (PTI): Israel has put on hold its plan to buy 

India?s pilotless target aircraft Lakshya and is instead going for an American 

system, which, officials say, has been offered by Washington for free.

 Tel Aviv had expressed interest two years ago to buy nearly 20 Lakshyas developed indigenously by the Bangalore-based Aeronautical Development Establishment, a unit of the Defence Research and Development Organisation focused on unmanned aerial vehicles.

 ?Israel has been silent since it expressed interest to buy Lakshyas two years ago. We have raised this issue with them but it has evoked no response,? a source at the Aeronautical Development Establishment said.

 Israel?s reluctance to place a firm order is because of an offer from the US to provide its Chakor and KD-2r5 pilotless target aircraft for free, sources added.

 Lakshya is a sub-sonic reusable aerial target system remotely piloted from the ground and is designed to impart training to airborne and air-defence pilots for weapon engagements. Israel, one of the world leaders in unmanned aerial vehicles, had paid India for conducting extensive trials of the Lakshya system in that country, but remained silent after it expressed interest to buy or lease it.

 The armed forces have already inducted Lakshyas, with state-run-aircraft maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, producing 25 pilotless target aircraft that are expected to be delivered in 2005.

 Prisoners to take Gandhi test

Mumbai (PTI): Around 150 prisoners will appear for a written

 Similar examinations were conducted in the prisons of Jalgaon, Pune, Yavatmal, Wardha, Sabarmati, Bhandara and Dhule in 2004.

 ?We can bring about a change in the mindset of prisoners and help them become better citizens by taking a lesson from Mahatma Gandhi?s life,? the spokesperson said.

 Winners will be awarded certificates and prizes on January 31, Martyrs? Day, at Thane jail.

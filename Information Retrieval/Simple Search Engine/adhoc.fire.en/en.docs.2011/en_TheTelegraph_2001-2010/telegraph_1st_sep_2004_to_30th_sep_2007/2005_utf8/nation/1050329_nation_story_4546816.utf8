 VAT Asim at Mulayam door

 OUR BUREAU

 Asim: No breakthrough

 Lucknow, March 28: Mulayam Singh Yadav today refused to be swayed by Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta?s VAT entreaties, leaving the tax implementation issue hanging three days to the deadline.

 ?Some confusion has been cleared. The process of finding a way out is on. But there is no chance of us immediately implementing it till the traders are convinced about the central government?s clarifications,? Mulayam Singh said after a 90-minute meeting with Dasgupta who had flown down especially to win him over.

 With this decision, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister has risked being seen as one with the BJP that is hostile to Union finance minister?s P. Chidambaram?s value-added tax proposal. All BJP-ruled states, including Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, as well as Tamil Nadu, are ranged against it.

 Earlier this month, Dasgupta ? also the VAT panel chairman ? had declared that the April 1 implementation of the tax would not be put off even if Uttar Pradesh did not come round.

 Leading traders? associations today have called nation-wide protests against the tax. While the Confederation of All-India Traders has stuck to its call for a three-day strike starting Wednesday, the Akhil Bharatiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal ? an organisation with influence in north India ? and chemists and petro dealers? associations have called a Bharat Mahabandh from tomorrow.

 Dasgupta today extolled the virtues of the tax in his meetings with Mulayam Singh and traders? body representatives. ?VAT is good for Uttar Pradesh and good for the traders. We have to jointly find a way out of this impasse,? he said

 Dasgupta tried to explain that the tax proposal was by no means anti-trader, saying the Centre had waived VAT for traders whose yearly turnover was up to Rs 10 lakh. Those with an annual turnover of Rs 50 lakh would have to pay only a nominal 0.25% tax, he pointed out.

 But his persuasion failed to cut any ice. Although the leaders heard him out, they refused to make any commitment. Nor did they budge when he provoked them by saying the Samajwadi Party would be seen as one with the BJP if they did not come round.

 Leaving no scope for any such doubts, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh said: ?We are in support of traders? interests. The BJP chief ministers are shedding crocodile tears. They had initially supported this tax.?

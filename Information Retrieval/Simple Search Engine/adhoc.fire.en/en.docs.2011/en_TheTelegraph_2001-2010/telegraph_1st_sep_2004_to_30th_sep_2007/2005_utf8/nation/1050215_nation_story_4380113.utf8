 Tihar shift for Pappu Yadav

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: The Supreme Court today ordered Pappu Yadav, the controversial Rashtriya Janata Dal MP from Madhepura in Bihar, to be shifted from Patna?s Beur jail to the high-security Tihar jail in Delhi. 

 The move is aimed at stopping Yadav from holding his regular durbar and conducting his business through cellphones and by mobilising supporters inside the jail. 

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha ordered the shifting of Yadav, accused in the murder of CPM legislator Ajit Sarkar, and directed the Tihar jail authorities not to ?extend any special privileges? while shifting him out of Beur jail. 

 The order was passed when Yadav was reportedly conducting his durbar at the jail. The judges observed that a ?clear-cut case? was made for the shift and ordered that he be moved within a week.

 The court rejected the arguments of Yadav?s counsel, R.K. Jain, that transferring him out of the Patna jail would result in negating the right to fair trial of the accused as six criminal cases were pending before various trial courts.

 It said video conferencing of evidence in the cases was a way out and the accused?s presence would be dispensed with.

 However, it said in ?exceptional and rare circumstances? trial courts in Bihar could seek the personal presence of the accused in the pending cases for which Yadav could be produced in Patna or any other trial court in Bihar. It said Yadav should be taken to court under police escort from Tihar and detained at a nearby prison with guards from the central jail.

 Condemning the abuse of the jail manual by Yadav on several occasions in the Beur jail, the judges said visitation rights at Tihar jail would only stand for his family members and others would be allowed under the jail rules.

 The bench noted that after the cancellation of Yadav?s bail in the Ajit Sarkar murder case, the Bihar government had constituted a medical board, which suggested lodging him in hospital. In the hospital, Yadav did not even spend a day in the prison ward but turned the intensive care unit and an adjoining room into a place for ?five-star? treatment.

 The judges said the court had taken notice of the fact that an FIR was lodged against him, while being in judicial custody at Beur jail, for conspiring to murder a person and that he had addressed a public meeting at Madhepura while in judicial custody.

 The complainant in the case, Kalyan Sarkar, brother of the slain Ajit Sarkar, was given security by the trial court after they received threats to their life. Pointing to this, the bench said it was one of the grounds for shifting Yadav to Tihar jail. In the same case, the court is contemplating installation of mobile phone jammers at all jails in the country.

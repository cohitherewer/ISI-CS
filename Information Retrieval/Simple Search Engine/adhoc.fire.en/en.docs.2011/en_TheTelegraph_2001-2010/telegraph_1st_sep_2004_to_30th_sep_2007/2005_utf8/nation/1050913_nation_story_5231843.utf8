 Heat on doctors

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: A special leave petition has been admitted today in the Supreme Court against three doctors of Calcutta, including the personal physician of India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly, Sukumar Mukherjee, in a medical negligence death case, reports our legal correspondent.

 Dr Mukherjee, Dr Baidyanath Haldar and Dr Abani Roy Chowdhury were allegedly guilty of medical negligence leading to the death of a US-based doctor, Anuradha Saha, when she visited Calcutta in 1998 along with her husband Kunal Saha.

 Todays petition challenges the acquittal of the three by Calcutta High Court. The senior counsel for the Sahas, Sushil Kumar, argued that the case was well within the realms, even if gross negligence has to be proved to criminally prosecute the doctors. He said 160 mg of steroids a day were administered to Anuradha and this much is not allowed even in one week.

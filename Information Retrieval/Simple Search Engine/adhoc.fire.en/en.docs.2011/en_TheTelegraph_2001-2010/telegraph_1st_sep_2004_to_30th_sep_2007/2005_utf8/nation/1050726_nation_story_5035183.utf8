 Bomb blows up Patna water board boss at meet

 Patna, July 25: In an audacious attack, four motorcycle-borne youths today hurled a bomb at the Patna Water Board chairman, Ashok Yadav, barely 100 metres from the Rashtriya Janata Dal office, killing him on the spot.

 The water board chief, a prominent RJD Yadav leader in the city, was about to begin a meeting this afternoon of Patna Municipal Corporation councillors loyal to him and opposed to mayor Krishna Murari Yadav. The mayor is an RJD leader, but in a rival faction.

 We were about to begin a meeting at the water board chairmans office, said ward IV councillor Abha Lata. 

 As there was a power failure, the chairman asked a peon to call an electrician. A few minutes later, four men, who looked young, entered the office and threw a bomb at the chairman, Abha Lata said. 

 There was a big noise. I fell from the chair and so did Pradeep Mehta, another councillor. A few minutes later we rushed out of the office. I saw the four persons going away on two motorcycles. 

 The bomb blew off the upper part of Yadavs body. Three councillors sustained injuries but are said to be out of danger. Abha Lata also suffered minor injuries.

 The official security provided to Yadav was withdrawn a few months ago. His driver Ram Dayal said: Saheb had been submitting letters to senior police officers, including the director-general of police, for restoring the security. No one listened to his requests and saheb was very worried with their approach. He must have felt a serious threat to his life.

 Yadavs other driver Ajju Khan said a rifle that Yadavs bodyguard used to carry was lying abandoned in his official Ambassador parked in front of the office. The administration is clearly responsible for his murder because the officials did not take his security seriously, he said.

 Soon after the incident, the water board chairmans supporters fanned out to different parts of the city, forcing shopkeepers to down shutters and blocking traffic. By early evening, vehicular movement in central Patna was reduced to a minimum. 

 A senior police officer, who blamed political rivalry for the murder, said the situation was under control and added that police stations have been asked to be on alert.

 Some of Yadavs supporters set fire to an Ambassador parked on the premises of the official residence of water board chief engineer Ravindra Kumar, barely a few metres from the board office. 

 The chief engineer, along with the mayor, had been deferring the re-constitution of the water board and other corporation committees. We will not spare anyone involved in this murder, a supporter said.

 Left bar to pension bill

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, March 17: The fate of the pension bill that seeks to link a part of the returns to market forces has come under a cloud with the CPM refusing to support it in Parliament.

 ?We will not support the pension bill and may not even support the patents bill unless the government accepts our amendments,? said a CPM leader as a four-day politburo meeting began here today.

 The government will not be able to pass the bills if the Left vote against them because the BJP has vowed to oppose both pieces of legislation. 

 This will be the first time that the CPM ? if it does so ? will oppose a bill piloted by the United Progressive Alliance. 

 However, the bills stand a chance if reluctance to vote along with the BJP forces the CPM to abstain, which will bring down the effective majority mark.

 More than the patents bill ? the CPM is open to a rethink if some of the amendments it has suggested are accepted ? what is worrying the Left is the pension legislation.

 The pension regulatory authority bill seeks to change the social security system from a benefit-oriented process to a contributory one. The bill proposes a 10 per cent contribution by employees, unlike the present pension scheme where workers do not have to make any contribution.

 The CPM is also opposed to investing social security funds in stocks as returns would then be linked to the performance of the markets. But the finance ministry and most members of the central board of provident fund trustees feel that the stock market is the best bet for higher returns.

 ?In the name of public-private partnership, the government is going to risk social security benefits. How can the government invest social security funds in stocks?? asked a CPM leader.

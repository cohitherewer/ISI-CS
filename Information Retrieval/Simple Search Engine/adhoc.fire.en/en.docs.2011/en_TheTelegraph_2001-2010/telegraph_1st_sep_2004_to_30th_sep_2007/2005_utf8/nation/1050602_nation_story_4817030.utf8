 Geelani out, Delhi melts

 MUKHTAR AHMAD AND MANAN KUMAR

 Srinagar/New Delhi, June 1: Almost all senior Kashmiri separatist leaders apart from Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Shabir Ahmad Shah will be travelling to Muzaffarabad tomorrow and from there to elsewhere in Pakistan.

 New Delhi, which had wanted the trip to be confined within Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), today relaxed its stand after satisfying itself that Geelani, a hardliner, would not join the tour.

 The Indian authorities have now decided to issue passports to the travellers so that they can extend their trip beyond PoK. To enter PoK, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference leaders would have needed only entry permits.

 External affairs ministry sources said the Centre had been wary of Geelani travelling beyond PoK and making fiery speeches on Pakistani soil, thus embarrassing the Indian government.

 Another reason was that Geelanis visit could have helped militant outfits and Hurriyat leaders based in PoK to realign themselves, an official said.

 Geelani, chairman of the hardline Hurriyat leaders, has refused to visit Pakistan maintaining that the real problem was in Kashmir and, therefore, the solution had to be found here instead of somewhere else.

 Some Indian officials, however, believe that by softening its stand, India has conceded Pakistans demand to involve Kashmiri leaders in the effort to find a solution to the Kashmir dispute.

 We are told the passports would be delivered to us soon, former Hurriyat chairman Abdul Ghani Bhat said.

 He added that it was up to the host to decide which part of the country the APHC leaders would be allowed to visit.

 Shabir Ahmad Shah, chief of the Democratic Freedom Party, and his associates will not go tomorrow as he has not received his travel documents. Shah said he had mentioned his nationality as Kashmiri instead of Indian on the entry permit form.

 Almost all the leaders said they would use their own transport up to Kaman Bridge on the Line of Control (LoC) and would not board the Karwan-e-Aman, the peace bus that carries passengers from Srinagar to Muzaffarabad.

 The five moderate Hurriyat leaders who would be among the travellers are its chairman Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, Abdul Ghani Bhat, Maulana Abbas Ansari, president of the Peoples Conference Bilal Ghani Lone and chief of Peoples Political Front Fazal Haq Qureshi.

 The pro-independence Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, which had announced a 17-member team, has now decided to send only the groups chairman, Mohammad Yasin Malik.

 Delhi push to death census

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: In a few years, if states match their words with action, Indians might just get to know what kills them ? tuberculosis, HIV, coronary diseases or simply malnutrition.

 The Centre has asked state governments to speed up the death census mandated by a 1960s law and put in place the infrastructure required to create the database conceptualised four decades ago.

 Once compiled, the cause-specific mortality profiles could help health workers analyse trends. It could also reveal geographical distribution and causes of death in different age groups. ?This can be a valuable information for everyone involved in public health, right from planners, administrators, epidemiologists and research workers,? a home ministry official said.

 So far, only about 15.5 per cent of registered deaths in the country are covered under the scheme called Medical Certification of Cause of Death.

 The central government, the official added, has already provided funds to states to train medical officers and those who would handle the statistics. State governments have been told to appoint nosologists ? doctors trained in the classification of diseases ? in the office of the chief registrar and promised reimbursement of the salary expenditure incurred for the next 10 years.

 Haryana, however, is the only state to have sanctioned the post. Seventeen other states, including Nagaland, Manipur, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, have initiated the process of creating the post. The rest, including Bengal, have not taken any action yet.

 Officials said the scheme has not generated the extent of data originally expected because of lack of expertise. However, a researcher from the University of Toronto, Dr Prabhat Jha, and his team of 16 have taken up a study to examine the cause of death among 1.5 lakh Indians as part of a global study that will cover six million people. The research would throw light on the spread of diseases like tuberculosis, which sections of people are affected by them and what governments can do.

 Jha?s report is expected to be completed this year, but government agencies, many of them floundering on the basic task of improving birth and death registration, could easily take a few years longer.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil today returned disappointed from a conference of state registrars of births and deaths. Just about 58 per cent of births and 51 per cent of deaths are registered in India. The government intends to take these figures to 100 per cent by 2010.

 Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which have performed abysmally on this count, were pulled up by the home minister. ?I would like this to be placed on record that this should not happen again. This is dismal,? Patil told them.

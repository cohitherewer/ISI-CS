 Rally muscle for employees

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Patna, Jan. 7: The high-level meeting between 

the Bihar government and representatives of the striking non-gazetted employees 

today failed to break the deadlock.

 At the end of the three-hour meeting with chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam, the employees? associations accused the government of further backtracking from its promises. But Subramanyam sounded optimistic. ?The talks are inching towards an amicable solution,? he said.

 Refusing to budge, the three associations have called for a massive demonstration at Gandhi Maidan on January 11. 

 Following the meeting of the associations with chief electoral officer K.C. Saha yesterday, the poll panel extended the deadline for the employees to resume work till January 12.

 While the government earlier seemed willing to meet the employees? demands for the merger of 50 per cent dearness allowance with basic pay, unconfirmed reports today suggested that it may not be able to do so due to ?financial constraints?.

 The talks will continue tomorrow despite the government?s official stand that it will not look into the demands of the employees till the elections are over.

 ?The government is willing to assure that it will consider our demands after the elections. It wants us to call off the strike in order to conduct the elections smoothly,? said Bihar Sachivalaya Sangh general secretary Manjul Kumar Das.

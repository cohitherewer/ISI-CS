The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ten questions for accident judge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: The BJP has begun trashing the Justice U.C. Banerjee interim report even as Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar has asked the Election Commission to stop Laloo Prasad Yadav from using the report in the run-up to the Bihar polls.

 The thrust of the BJP campaign is that the report on the Godhra train carnage, which states that the fire was ?accidental? and not the result of a conspiracy as the party alleges, was tailored to serve Laloo Prasad?s political ends. The BJP also says the probe was rushed, piecemeal, not thorough, had no ?legal basis or statutory status? and thus was of ?no consequence?.

 Even as his party tried to dub the report as inconsequential, BJP general secretary and spokesperson Arun Jaitley said: ?Serious questions relating to the appointment, jurisdiction, functioning and the recommendations of the committee arise.? He added that the BJP had posed 10 such questions to Justice Banerjee so that a ?proper discourse on a matter of public importance? can take place.

 Some of the questions are:

 Did Justice Banerjee consider 

 the evidence that two meetings took place on the night of 

 February 26, 2002, at the Aman Guest House in Godhra where 

 the ?conspiracy? to set the Sabarmati Express? S-6 coach 

 ablaze was hatched?

 Did he consider that one 

 of the conspirators, Salim Badam, was checking on the train?s 

 movements on February 27 as it was running four hours late?

 Did the judge take into 

 account that the alarm chains were simultaneously pulled 

 in various compartments so that the mob at the platform 

 could pelt stones on the train?

 Virtually accusing Justice Banerjee of playing into Laloo Prasad?s hands, a BJP statement asked: ?Do you realise that the ?accident theory? propounded by you is not an original thought? This was propounded by the accused in the case and repeated by Shri Lalu Prasad Yadav, the railway minister, while announcing your appointment. You have merely stamped the ?Lalu theory?.?

 The BJP demanded to know if a committee appointed by the railway was empowered to examine the ?conspiracy? angle. The party added that the report amounted to an ?extra-constitutional? interference in the administration of justice since the trial was pending before a special court.

 Implying that the probe was selective, Jaitley said the panel had not summoned the investigating officer appointed by the special investigative tribunal probing the case. 

 The BJP spokesperson said the ?most serious? matter was that the three Gujarat police officials who investigated the Godhra carnage were asked to meet the committee today, a day after the interim report was released. ?This buttresses the perception that the interim report is less concerned with facts and more with the (coming) elections,? he said.

 Privately, BJP sources concede the report could fulfil two of Laloo Prasad?s aims. One, putting Ram Vilas Paswan on the backfoot as far as his alleged ?secret understanding? with the Dal (U) and Nitish is concerned. Second, the Congress that hoped to wean away some Muslim votes may find it difficult to do so now as ?the report has bipolarised the Bihar polity again into pro-Laloo and anti-Laloo voters?.

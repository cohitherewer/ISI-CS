 Prince boost to mill sites

 Mumbai, March 6 (PTI): Mill sites, the once-famous landmarks of the city but now dilapidated and deserted following their closure, have evoked interest from a new quarter ? Prince Charles.

 The Prince of Wales?s Phoenix Trust and the International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture and Urbanism have joined the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage to hold a workshop for revitalising the mill sites and the surroundings.

 The workshop aims at drafting plans to revive the mill lands without destroying the essence of their historical fabric. The sites are spread over central and south Mumbai. Students and practitioners from here and abroad will work with architects and conservationists as part of the workshop.

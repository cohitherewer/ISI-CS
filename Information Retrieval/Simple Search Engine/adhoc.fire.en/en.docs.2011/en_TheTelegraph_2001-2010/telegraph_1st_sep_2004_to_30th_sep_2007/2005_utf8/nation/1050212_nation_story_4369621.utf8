The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Time for doubts after girl rescue

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 11: Seventeen-year-old Dipika Dipanjali Biswal, missing from her Nayapalli home in Bhubaneswar since January 31, was rescued from Valsad district in Gujarat last night. 

 Dipanjali, a Class X student of Maharishi Vidya Mandir here, was found in the Sarigaon area of Valsad along with two youths, during a joint raid by Gujarat and Bhubaneswar police. 

 ?The girl will arrive here tomorrow with the police team,? said superintendent of police Amitav Thakur, adding that the youths, Ashok Sahu and Kishan, are also being brought to Bhubaneswar for interrogation. 

 The Bhubaneswar police team comprising sub-inspector Satyajit Mishra and constable P.K. Patnaik of Nayapalli police station will board a train tonight.

 ?We just can?t believe that our daughter has been rescued. We are so happy,? a relieved Jatindranath Biswal, father of Dipanjali, told The Telegraph. 

 Biswal is deputy general manager (sales) at IISCO, a subsidiary of SAIL.

 Though the events leading to the alleged abduction of Dipanjali are shrouded in mystery, there were conflicting reports on the disappearance of the girl. 

 ?The girl was not abducted. We will give you the details once she arrives here,? said Thakur, hinting at a possible elopement angle. However, the girl?s parents firmly believed that Dipanjali was abducted.

 The girl?s father said the media, more than the police, helped trace his daughter. But Dipanjali?s parents seemed unhappy about not being able to talk to their daughter after her rescue. 

 According to sources, the teenaged girl had a tiff with her family members on January 30, the day before she disappeared. After leaving her house, she went to the railway station and boarded a train for Visakhapatnam to meet her brother-in-law, they claimed.

 In the train, Dipanjali met Ashok Sahu, who persuaded her to accompany him to Secunderabad in Andhra Pradesh. 

 After getting off at Secunderabad, Sahu called up Biswal?s parents and reportedly asked for a ransom of Rs 10 lakh. Later, he took the girl to Surat where his brother worked. Gujarat police, after getting a tip-off that the girl was with Sahu, jointly raided a place in Sarigaon with their Orissa counterparts and rescued the girl.

 This is the second success for Orissa police in as many days. Yesterday, a girl from the same area in the city was brought back from Haryana.

 Party pangs for minister

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

Bhubaneswar, Jan. 3: New Year revelry at a 

hotel on Puri-Konark Road has put BJP leader and Orissa higher education minister 

Sameer Dey under the ?scanner?.

 A TV camera caught Dey dancing to a Kal Ho Naa Ho number at the hotel on New Year?s Eve even as his party urged the people of the state not to go overboard in the wake of the tsunami tragedy. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik too had appealed to the state to forsake all celebrations. 

 ?I don?t know anything about it. But politicians should know how to behave in public,? Patnaik later said.

 ?It?s disgusting. How can one celebrate when over 1.5 lakh people have died in a natural disaster,? said state Bajrang Dal chief Subash Chouhan, adding, ?this is unfortunate. The minister should publicly apologise for his act.? The Congress and CPM too have sought a public apology from Dey.

 State BJP chief Juel Oram said no action will be taken against Dey as it was a private celebration. ?He was with his family members. As a minister, he has to fulfil many commitments,? he said. Dey was not available for comments.

 Meanwhile, the government has said 209 people from Orissa are still missing in the tsunami-hit Andamans. 

 ?We have been able to locate 164 people so far. Efforts are on to find the rest,? said deputy relief commisioner Naba Nayak.

 On Sunday, it was a happy homecoming for Narayan Manna and Ganesh Maiti of Saneipur village under Mahakalpada block of Kendrapara district. Both Manna and Maiti were working as masons in the Andamans for the past three years. 

 ?After reaching Chennai we immediately boarded a train for Orissa,? Maiti said. While it was relief for the two families, relatives of several other missing persons fear the worst, as a week has already passed by. Silence prevails in the house of Sankara Giri in the seaside village of Sailendranagar, as his family awaits a message from Sankara.

 He had left his village five years ago after it was devastated by the super-cyclone.

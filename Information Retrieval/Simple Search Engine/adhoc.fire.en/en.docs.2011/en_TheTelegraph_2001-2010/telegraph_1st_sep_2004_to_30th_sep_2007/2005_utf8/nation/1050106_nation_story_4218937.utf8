 Clean chit for Anara

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Hyderabad, Jan. 5: Kareena Kapoor may or may not have been kissing in that infamous videoclip but Anara Gupta certainly was not.

 The Andhra Pradesh State Forensic Laboratory today said the woman featuring in the pornographic CDs sent to it by Jammu and Kashmir police was not the former Miss Jammu.

 ?We have examined the material received from Jammu and Kashmir police and it was found that the pictures depicted in the pornographic CD were not that of the former Miss Jammu,? lab director K.P.C. Gandhi said.

 ?It is now the job of J amp;K police to say who the girl is? The scientific analysis showed there was no match in all the 22 features of comparison,? he added, explaining the woman featured in the CD had been matched against domestic videos and photographs of Anara.

 Anara was arrested in early November after the police slapped a case on her for allegedly producing pornographic CDs. She was later freed on bail. She also petitioned the National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission for Women alleging police torture and illegal confinement.

 In Jammu, the police said they would seek a second opinion. ?We know the Hyderabad-based lab has said the pictures did not match with that of Anara in the CD. But we will take a second opinion,? DGP Gopal Sharma said. The police later held a high-level meeting.

 Anara?s family members were relieved when they heard of the report. ?We had always said Anara was not the girl in the porn CD. She was made the culprit by the police. The lab report has come to us as a relief,? her brother Prince said.

 ?God has come to our help. We were ignored by all, including our relatives. This report has come to us as God?s gift. It is a big slap for the police and all those who harassed, tortured and defamed my sister.?

 Prince, who had knocked the doors of the rights panel and the women?s commission along with Anara?s mother Raj Rani, said the family would continue its fight against the police. ?We will continue our fight to teach the police a lesson. We have already filed a Rs 1 crore defamation suit against them. We will also fight over the illegal detention and inhuman torture of Anara in police custody.?

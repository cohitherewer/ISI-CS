 Sparkling Saturn 

 Mumbai, Jan. 10 (PTI): Skywatchers will have a rare opportunity on January 13 and 14 to observe Saturn at its ?brightest? when the Earth passes between the sun and the ringed planet.

 This year?s ?opposition of Saturn? is considered the brightest till the one scheduled for December 11, 2031, the Akash Ganga Centre for Astronomy in Thane district said.

 At opposition, a planet comes closest to the earth and also shines at its brightest for the year. Oppositions of Saturn come about two weeks later every year. 

 After this year?s opposition, Saturn will become dimmer, and in the years 2009 and 2010 will appear the dimmest, the centre said.

 There are two reasons why this year?s opposition is so favourable. First, Saturn will be about as closest to the earth as the ringed planet can get. Second, the rings will be as wide open as they can get. These rings reflect a lot of sunlight, making the planet bright.

 Amateur astronomers will have a chance to observe Saturn?s satellites, the centre said.

 In 2009, Saturn?s rings will appear edge-on, featuring the planet at its dimmest.

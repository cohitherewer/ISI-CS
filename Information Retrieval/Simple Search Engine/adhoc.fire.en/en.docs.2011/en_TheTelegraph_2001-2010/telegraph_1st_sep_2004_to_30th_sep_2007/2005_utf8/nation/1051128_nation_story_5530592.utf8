 Mittal: Court duel

 London, Nov. 27: Lakshmi Mittal, the steel tycoon and Britains richest man, is suing a former business partner in the High Court in London in a dispute over an investment in a Zambian copper project.

 The case, due before the court in the next few days, is being brought by Allenby Finance, a company based in the British Virgin Islands and owned by Mittal, against Dallah Albaraka, a group based in the Isle of Man.

 According to court documents seen by the Sunday Telegraph, Allenby is suing Dallah Albaraka for damages of $3.7 million. The dispute centres on a funding agreement signed in October 1997. 

 Under the agreement, Allenby Finance, Dallah Albaraka and a third party, Gokul Binani, committed funds to acquire two copper mines in Zambia from the state-owned Zambian Consolidated Copper Mine.

 Relations between the partners turned sour after Dallah Albaraka allegedly withdrew a bank facility it had secured for the investment.

 A spokesman for Dallah Albaraka said: Dallah Albaraka (Ireland) Limited confirms it is involved in litigation with Allenby Finance Limited.

 The news is likely to surprise company watchers. Mittal was born into an Indian steel dynasty but has built up a vast business empire outside the country.

 A spokeswoman for Mittal declined to comment on the case but said: Allenby Finance is a vehicle owned by Mr Mittal. It has nothing to do with Mittal Steel company.

 Patna, Aug. 13: Two senior officials of Bajaj Allianz, a private insurance company, have been reported missing since last night and are feared to have been abducted.

 Branch manager Rakesh Shankar and sales manager Prem Prakash had allegedly gone to attend a business call but could not be traced after that. Relatives of the duo have lodged a complaint with Gandhi Maidan police, alleging possible abduction. Their families have, however, not reported any ransom call yet.

 Both had gone out about 9 last night to meet a client, who is believed to have been calling up since the last three days wanting to register an insurance policy. When they did not return even at 11, we informed the police, said Sanjay Jha, a senior employee of the company.

 Sam Ghosh, CEO of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said: Both the employees are from our life insurance arm. They have been missing since yesterday but we are not sure whether they have been kidnapped. A case has been registered with the police.

 This morning, the police traced the motorcycle the duo used. It was lying abandoned at Patna railway station. We are looking into the incident from all angles. So far we have no clue to suggest abduction, superintendent of police (city) Rakesh Rathi said.

 The families, friends and colleagues of the missing officials demonstrated in Patna today and demanded their immediate rescue. 

 A delegation met the chief secretary and the governor and appealed for prompt action. The police are investigating the case, chief secretary G.S. Kang said, adding that the senior superintendent has given an assurance that the case will be solved at the earliest.

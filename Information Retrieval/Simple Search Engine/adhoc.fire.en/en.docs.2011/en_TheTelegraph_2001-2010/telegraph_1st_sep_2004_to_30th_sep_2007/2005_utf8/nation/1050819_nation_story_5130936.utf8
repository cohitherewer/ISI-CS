 Suicide bid over seats

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Aug. 18: Two students tried to set themselves on fire in Coimbatore today in protest against the Supreme Court order allowing self-financing private colleges to drop caste quotas.

 Police stopped the protesters after they had doused themselves in kerosene in front of the district collectors office. The students were supporters of the Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, a breakaway faction of the Dravidar Kazhagam, officers said.

 The act of desperation brought back memories of the 1990s anti-Mandal agitation ?when many students had immolated themselves in protest against job reservations ?amid a more peaceful protest by Left-wing students.

 Across the state, students have been boycotting classes and holding marches. They want the Centre to promulgate an ordinance.

 A contrary view, however, came from a former head of the countrys largest technical university. Prof. A. Kalanidhi, who was vice-chancellor of Anna University, said the judgment cannot be faulted.

 He cited Indias commitments to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which allow foreign universities to set up shop in the country. Because we signed the WTO agreement, foreign universities are coming in and you cannot restrict them by insisting on reservations, he argued.

 Second, asking self-financing colleges to set aside seats for quotas forces them to charge higher fees from general category students, he said.

 Also, lowering the eligibility criteria to admit quota students leads to a dilution of standards. The private colleges can hardly afford this if they have to produce well-qualified graduates for a highly competitive global job market, the professor argued.

 The former adviser to the All India Council For Technical Education also said that the current reservation system benefits only the creamy layer among the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

 So reservation, to be fruitful, must take into account the students economic background with their social status. Introduce an income criterion as an initial cut-off point and then within that you can still implement the quota for the various communities.

 And once the government has done this, it should ? instead of asking the self-financing colleges to provide concessions -- directly support these students by, for instance, offering 50 fully paid-up scholarships at every private professional college, Kalanidhi said.

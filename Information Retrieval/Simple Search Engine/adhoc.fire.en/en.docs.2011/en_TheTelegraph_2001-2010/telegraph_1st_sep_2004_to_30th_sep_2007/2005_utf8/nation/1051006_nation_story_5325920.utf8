The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Sorry zzzir! We were catching thieves all night

 The Union home minister believes 

 it will fill a yawning gap in policing. But CBI director 

 U.S. Misra ( PTI picture) seems to think the whole idea 

 is a big yawn. 

 The chief of the countrys 

 premier investigative agency dozed off at a conference of 

 police bosses in New Delhi on Wednesday, where Shivraj Patil 

 unfurled his latest plan to tackle crime and militancy.

 High fives

 The home ministers plan 

 is simple. Divide up the country into five zones ? north, 

 south, east, west and northeast ? and set up a regional 

 body for each. So that directors-general of police could 

 meet regularly to discuss crime and terror trends and draw 

 up strategies.

 As head of a federal agency, Misra 

 probably has little interest in state and regional police 

 bodies.The minister, however, insisted that the zonal bodies 

 are absolutely necessary. Criminals and militants care little 

 for state borders, he told the assembled directors-general 

 and inspectors-general ? at least, those who were awake 

 and listening. Therefore, stepping up co-ordination among 

 states is a must. I would suggest these bodies meet 

 at least once every quarter, Patil said.

 Maoist headache

 The minister was happy that violence 

 was declining in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast, but 

 described the Maoists as a serious threat.

 Naxalism feeds on the widespread 

 socio-economic, political and regional inequities, coupled 

 with poverty, unemployment and lack of proper infrastructure, 

 Patil told the gathering.

 We have to, therefore, accord 

 higher priority to ensure faster, integrated development 

 of Naxalite-affected areas. This, the minister added, 

 needed to be backed up by firm action from a well-trained 

 and well-equipped police force armed with good intelligence 

 inputs.

 Reforms

 Patil said his ministry would 

 set up a committee to examine recommendations on police 

 reforms.

 We have taken the important 

 decision to set up a committee to draft a bill for a new 

 police act, which will submit its report within six months. 

 It would be ensured that a Central Police Act legislation 

 is enacted to replace the ancient Act of 1861, he 

 said. The Prime Minister will address the conference, organised 

 by the Intelligence Bureau, on Thursday.

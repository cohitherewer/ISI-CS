 Apple recce team in Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 2: A team 

 from the US-based Apple Computer today met chief minister 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as part of a reconnaissance mission 

 for setting up shop here.

 If the company decides to go ahead, it will be one of the biggest global names Calcutta can showcase. They want to set up a BPO unit as well as a software development centre. The team today inspected land at Rajarhat and other sites across the city, information technology minister Manab Mukherjee said. 

 The five-member team, headed by senior director, real estate and development, was accompanied by Mukherjee and IT secretary G.D. Gautama. The team made enquiries about the facilities provided by the government to the IT sector. They also enquired about availability of land, Mukherjee said.

 Bhattacharjee reportedly briefed the team about the progress Bengal has made in the IT sector and the facilities, including incentives being offered by the state.

 This is the first time the company is venturing outside the US for such operations. In addition to Calcutta, the team will tour four other cities, including Mohali, Mumbai and Bangalore, and evaluate their prospects in each. The company will finalise its projects and take a decision about the cities they will invest in by October, Mukherjee said.

 IT department officials said if the company decides to set up the BPO unit in Rajarhat, it will take around a year to come up and will employ approximately 3,000 people.

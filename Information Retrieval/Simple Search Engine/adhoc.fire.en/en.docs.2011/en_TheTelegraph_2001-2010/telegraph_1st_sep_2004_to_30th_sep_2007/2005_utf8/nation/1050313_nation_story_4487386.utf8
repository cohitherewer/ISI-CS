 Gaur cries ?monkey? over letter 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Maihar (Madhya Pradesh), March 12: Faced with growing disquiet and an unsigned ?chargesheet? doing the rounds in state BJP circles, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur today dared detractors to come out in the open instead of resorting to ?monkey tricks?.

 Gaur, dedicating a newly-built 141-km Satna-Umaria road project here, said there was no shortcut to development. 

 ?The recent Assembly polls have once again proved that people reject those who fail to develop infrastructure. There is no substitute to development. People want roads, water, power, education, health and law and order,? he told a sizeable crowd in the temple town famous for Sharda peeth. 

 Gaur seemed upset over the circulation of an unsigned letter in Bhopal, which many feel is the handiwork of those loyal to former chief minister Uma Bharti.

 The letter has accused Gaur of patronising corruption and going back on the BJP?s poll promises. Asked to comment, an angry Gaur said: ?Why do not they muster courage to sign it? I will then respond.? 

 The letter also charges Gaur with bailing out his predecessor Digvijay Singh in an alleged land scam.

 Addressed to ?all dedicated workers of the BJP?, the letter says: ?The BJP before coming to power accused Digvijay Singh of illegally amassing Rs 1,500 crore and after forming the government, it had lodged cases against Singh with the economic offences wing (EOW) of police. But during the Gaur regime, EOW officers have been replaced by corrupt officers loyal to Singh, who have given him a clean chit.? 

 The chief minister denied helping out Singh, pointing out that the cases are in court. ?How can I intervene in a matter that is in court?? he asked.

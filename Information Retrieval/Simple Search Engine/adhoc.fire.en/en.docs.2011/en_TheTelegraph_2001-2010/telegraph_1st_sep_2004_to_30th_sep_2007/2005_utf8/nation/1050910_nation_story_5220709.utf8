 Return Passage

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: The Wagah border, where the passion-filled beating the retreat ceremony is held every evening, will witness another emotionally-charged scene on September 12 when India and Pakistan exchange hundreds of prisoners and fisherfolk.

 The Centre today said it will release 101 Pakistani civilians and 51 fishermen at Wagah on Monday, in line with the declaration in the joint statement made at the end of the home secretary-level talks on August 30. 

 Pakistan responded by deciding to release 371 Indian fishermen and 64 civilian prisoners the same day.

 Those released will be sent to their respective states, said a home ministry official.

 The civilian prisoners being released are those who have completed their sentences and whose travel documents have been issued by their high commissions.

 Of the 101 Pakistani civilian prisoners, six would be released from Bengal, one each from Nagaland and Maharashtra, 31 from Jammu and Kashmir, 30 from Punjab, 20 from Rajasthan, 10 from Gujarat and two from Delhi.

 States have been advised to bring the Pakistani civilian prisoners as well as the fishermen to the Wagah border on September 12 for handing them over to the Pakistani authorities, said Omkar Kedia, a home ministry spokesperson.

 Arrangements have been made for providing consular access to Pakistani civilian prisoners undergoing sentence or trial in the country, said the joint secretary (foreigners), in the home ministry, D.S. Mishra.

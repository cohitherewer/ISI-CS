 Srishti Sharma was on the phone, speaking to her mother Neha who had gone out shopping. The next moment she heard a bang, then her mothers mobile went silent.

 The 12-year-old has not heard from her mother since.

 An hour after the blast, one of the three that ripped through Delhi this afternoon, Srishtis grandmother Kamlesh was outside Lady Hardinge Hospital, wondering about the fate of her daughter and son-in-law Shyam Sunder who had gone Diwali shopping to the Paharganj market.

 It was 6.30. Two hours later, she still did not know if they were dead or alive. 

 We went inside but were not able to find them. They are not allowing anyone in but the scene inside is quite horrible. There are dead and injured people lying everywhere, she said.

 Too dazed to talk were little Sagar and Varun who huddled in a corner outside the hospital. Both had minor injuries on their leg and nose but did not know the fate of their mother and grandmother who had taken them shopping.

 Naresh Gupta, a beedi and cigarette wholesale dealer, was in his shop when one of the bombs exploded.

 My brother Ashok was standing outside. There is a shop, M.L. Jewellers, at 6 Tooti Chowk close to ours. There was a two-wheeler parked in front of it and the bomb was probably in it. There was a huge blast. Our ears are still affected. The glass in the shops shattered. As soon as we heard the blast, I ran out. I managed to escape but my brother got hurt in the eye.

 As he ran, Gupta saw women lying dead. There were little children in a rickshaw and they also died in the blast, he said.

 A man emerged from the hospital, his head bandaged. I was buying dhoop (incense sticks) from the panwallah when there was a huge explosion. I heard the sound of glass breaking. I touched my head and saw blood, he said as relatives led him away.

 My husband has a plastics shop at 6 Tooti Chowk, very close to where the blast happened, said Sanjay Chananas wife as she waited outside Lady Hardinge Hospital. He says his ears are still hurting.

 Another bone to pick for Left

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: The Centre has moved to lower its vigil on whether small and medium enterprises are flouting labour laws, angering the Left.

 The government has drafted the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Bill, which says these industries will no longer undergo routine inspections to make sure they are complying with lab-our laws. Instead, they will practise self-regulation through self-inspections.

 A Left MP alleged the draconian bill aims to scrap all labour laws for 75 per cent of the workforce and vowed to oppose it in Parliament.

 The ambit of the bill covers a wide range of workers benefits, including insurance, provident fund, maternity benefits, bonus and gratuity. It says its objective is to facilitate promotion, development and competitiveness of small and medium enterprises.

 In the name of competitiveness, the bill seeks to do away with labour laws, CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta said. There will be no proper inspection of the implementation of labour laws. He suggested the bill be read with the Prime Ministers recent remarks on labour reforms.

 In an interview to Mckinsey Quarterly, Manmohan Singh had favoured labour reforms and labour market flexibility. We do not have a broad-based consensus in our coalition to assert that I can move forward in a big way, he had said. It is my task to carry my conviction to my Left colleagues in Delhi. I have not given up.

 The bill defines an enterprise in the manufacturing sector as small if investment in plant and machinery does not exceed Rs 5 crore; and as medium if its within Rs 10 crore. In the service sector, small means the investment in equipment is not over Rs 2 crore and medium means it is within Rs 5 crore.

 This will cover 75 per cent of the workforce, Dasgupta said. 

 Even now, despite routine inspections, many small and medium industries flout labour laws. The Left believes freeing the owners from outside inspection will lead to more violations.

 The Centre is keen on labour reforms. It wants to amend the Industrial Disputes Act to facilitate hire-and-fire. The Left is opposed to this.

 Labour laws that come under the draft bill include Payment of Wages Act, Employees State Insurance Act, Factories Act, Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, Maternity Benefit Act, Payment of Bonus Act and Payment of Gratuity Act.

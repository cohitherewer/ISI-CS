 Aug. 7: Going full steam 

 ahead with its ritual pre-Independence Day terror run, the 

 Ulfa blew up an oil pipeline, triggered a blast that killed 

 four, exchanged fire with police in Guwahati and attempted 

 to blow up a train since midnight yesterday.

 At least seven persons were injured ? four died in hospital ? when a powerful improvised explosive device went off at a bus stop in Boko, under Kamrup district, around 7 pm today. The bomb was strapped to a bicycle, the police said.

 An hour later, another Ulfa team set off an explosion under a bridge at Rangajan, about 20 km from Duliajan in Tinsukia district, destroying one end of the steel bridge. The bridge is in an area that has several oil and gas-collecting stations and is frequented by Oil India Limited (OIL) officials, CISF and army personnel. 

 The latest spurt of violence began last night with a blast at a crude pipeline over the Disang river, at Bokotha under Sivasagar police station. The blast and the subsequent oil pressure led to a fire that engulfed a large part of the nearby Bakchu Konwar village.

 The Sivasagar district administration set up a relief camp this morning and distributed food to the affected families, who were also given assistance of Rs 1,000 each. A team of doctors and vets is camping in the area. Sivasagar deputy commissioner K.K. Dwivedi said 10 Ulfa militants came around 11.30 pm and overpowered 12 home guards watching over the pipeline that carries crude oil to Bongaigaon refinery.

 Sources in OIL said it would take about three days to restore supply.

 The blast was followed by an attack on a phone exchange at Dhamdha, in Nalbari district, just after midnight. The next incident was an encounter between an Ulfa team and the police at Tetelia in Guwahati, around 3 am. One militant was killed.

 Militants also tried to target the Guwahati-Lumding train, which reached Lanka at 11 am, with a bomb planted on the track at Lanka, 60 km from Nagaon.

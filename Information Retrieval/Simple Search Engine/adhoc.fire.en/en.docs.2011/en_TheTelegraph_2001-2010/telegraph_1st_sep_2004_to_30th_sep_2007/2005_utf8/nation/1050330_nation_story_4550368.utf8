 Taslimuddin case details

 New Delhi, March 29 (PTI): Scrutinising the former Rashtriya Janata Dal government?s decision to withdraw an attempt to murder case against Union minister Mohammad Taslimuddin, the Supreme Court today wanted to know the details of the other accused in the case as a petition sought transfer of the trial outside the state.

 A bench comprising Justices N. Santosh Hegde, D.M. Dharmadhikari and S.B. Sinha asked Bihar to furnish within four weeks details of the other accused in the case while hearing a PIL filed by an NGO, Delhi Study Group, challenging the withdrawal of the case against the Union minister and RJD leader.

 Appearing for the state, advocate B.B. Singh opposed the plea for transfer of the case outside the state saying there were 13 other accused facing trial in the case who would be adversely affected.

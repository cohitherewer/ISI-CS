 Raid on Valley tax hub

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Jan. 7: A militant attack on the income-tax headquarters here today killed four persons, including a BSF deputy commandant, and gave the administration some anxious moments when part of the building caught fire.

 A two-member suicide squad stormed the heavily guarded I-T office in the Babarshah complex in the high-security Civil Lines locality in the afternoon, police said.

 ?The suicide attackers hurled hand grenades and rained bullets from automatics on the CRPF guards manning the bunker at the main entrance. One CRPF soldier died on the spot and the fidayeens went inside the building and killed a policeman,? said Syed Ahmad Syed, the officiating senior superintendent of police.

 The Border Security Force officer, S.S. Rawat, succumbed to serious injuries at the army hospital here late this evening.

 One of the militants, too, died in the exchange of fire.

 A CRPF commander is being treated in hospital.

 Panic gripped the state administration as around 70 staff members and visitors were inside the building. It was compounded when the top floor caught fire in the shootout between the holed-up militants and security personnel.

 ?I had just returned after offering Friday prayers. I was sitting in my office room and suddenly there was a loud sound followed by bursts of automatic weapon fire,? said Riyaz Bhat, a staffer.

 ?We tried to hide under tables and chairs. We then took shelter in a second-floor room. The first thing I did when I entered was to throw down the gas cylinder used for heating the stove.?

 ?The women employees and officers panicked. They were screaming. Bullets were flying from all sides. I lost all hope as the fire was spreading fast,? Bhat recalled.

 The troops, police and fire brigade personnel, however, managed to evacuate all the employees and visitors by putting up a ladder near a rear window. Fire tenders used water canons that flooded the top floor.

 ?All civilians, who included the staff of the income-tax department, were rescued unharmed,? said Javed Ahmad Mukhdoomi, the Kashmir zone police chief.

 Some paramilitary personnel stationed inside the building managed to jump down as the fighting raged between the securitymen and the militants.

 Syed had rushed to the spot with heavy paramilitary and police reinforcements.

 ?We have reports that one militant is still holed up in the building. Troops shot dead one militant and his body is lying inside,? Mukhdoomi said.

 The operation has been called off for the night though a tight cordon is in place. The area has been flooded with light so that the surviving militant does not escape under cover of darkness.

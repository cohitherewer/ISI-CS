 Birthday decision on Thursday 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 13: Left leaders will meet on Thursday to decide whether they will attend the UPA governments anniversary celebrations. 

 The CPM and CPI are, meanwhile, coming up with their respective reality checks on the governments achievements and the picture does not match the ruling coalitions claims.

 The CPM politburo begins its two-day meeting in the capital tomorrow to review the UPA governments performance. 

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan has made his partys assessment clear in his latest article in New Age, the party mouthpiece.

 The response to the UPA in the CPM camp is mixed, according to its MP Nilotpal Basu.

 The Left concedes that the government has covered some ground in sectors like agriculture, rural development, but its record still falls short of the Lefts expectations.

 At yesterdays breakfast meeting, Left leaders listed the areas where the UPA government has faltered.

 These include the failure to bring the national employment guarantee act, tribal and forest right bill and the womens reservation bill. 

 The Left also criticised the governments decision to amend the banking regulation act.

 Buta call for war on gangs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, May 3: A day after Buta Singh appointed Ashish Ranjan Sinha as the new director-general of police, the governor today asked him to immediately identify the active criminal gangs, especially those involved in extortion rackets, and crack down on them.

 A communiqu? said the governor took strong note of reports of a doctor receiving extortion threat and issued the directive to the police chief. ?My priority is to provide security and peace to the common people,? Singh said.

 Police sources said since the imposition of central rule, the crime situation in the state, especially Patna, has improved and the ?usual? reports of murder and extortion threats have ?almost disappeared?. Police patrolling in the capital has already been intensified under the direct supervision of the new inspector-general Abhayanand, who has warned the different station officers against a rise in the crime graph.

 Sources said the new police chief is expected to issue fresh orders in this regard, more so since the governor has listed law and order as his top priority. 

 Singh has also stressed on proper utilisation of funds earmarked for the various rural development programmes. Addressing a meeting of deputy development commissioners and bankers, Singh today said special emphasis should be laid on poverty alleviation, the mid-day meal scheme and pulse polio.

 ?The deputy development commissioners have a crucial role to play in making these programmes successful. I am, however, getting regular complaints on the implementation of the Indira Awaas Yojana in the state. This is also the responsibility of the development officers,? he added.

 The governor told the bankers that the credit-deposit ratio of Bihar was many notches below the national average and serious efforts were needed to improve the situation. ?Local bank officials need to take interest in the disbursal of timely loans to applicants,? he added.

 Representatives of State Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Nabard were present at the meeting, attended by the chief secretary, development commissioner and rural development secretary. 

 Official sources said Singh will issue further directives in this regard.

 Judge vetoes activism

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 23: Judges should not cross their limits ? the verdict came from the judge himself.

 The chief justice, to be more correct. Just because we are judges we cannot say do this or do that, Markenday Katju said as he rejected the Tamil Nadu governments suggestions that Madras High Court intervene in modifying the guidelines for admissions to professional courses.

 The judiciary, he added, should not become the executive and the legislature by infringing on their domains, as such activism could lead to its powers and independence being curbed.

 The remarks came in the course of arguments on the petitions challenging the Jayalalithaa governments decision to scrap the common entrance test from this academic year.

 Katju, who reserved his order, later said the verdict would be given very soon.

 Supreme Court lawyer P.P. Rao, who appeared for Tamil Nadu, pleaded that the entrance test was not necessarily the only method of choosing students. He also said a judicial order would allow a departure from regulations.

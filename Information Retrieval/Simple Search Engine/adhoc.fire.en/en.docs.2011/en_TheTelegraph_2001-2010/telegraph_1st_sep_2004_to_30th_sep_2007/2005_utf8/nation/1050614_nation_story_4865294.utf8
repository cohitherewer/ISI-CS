 Indian Dr Death spotted in US

 Sydney (PTI): An Indian-origin surgeon known as Doctor Death and linked to more than 80 deaths in an Australian hospital has been sighted in the US, a newspaper said on Monday.

 Jayant Patel and his wife were seen showing friends a house that was for sale in Portland, Oregon, the Australian newspaper said quoting a resident.

 Patel had fled Australia earlier this year as investigations into his work at the Bundaberg base hospital began, the paper said. The resident, who refused to give her name, said Patel was living in a million-dollar home in an upmarket neighbourhood.

 He just walked down the street, he just walked in... He looked exactly the same as he looked on television, the paper quoted her as saying. It was creepy.

 On Friday, Australian police launched a worldwide manhunt for Patel after an inquiry recommended that the medic linked to 87 deaths be extradited to face trial for murder, criminal negligence, fraud and making false representations.

 Patel began working in Bundaberg in 2003, after a 20-year career of botched operations and surgical malpractice claims which saw him banned from surgery in the American states of New York and Oregon. However, he, failed to disclose his chequered record when applying for the job in Australia.

 Rare hip surgery on dwarf 

 Indore (PTI): The hips of a dwarf, who was unable to stand, were replaced successfully at a private hospital. 

 The total hip replacement (THR) surgery was performed successfully on Pandit Rajkumar Acharya of Vidisha district measuring three feet and seven inches and weighing just 23 kg at SNG hospital, Dr S.N. Goyal, who performed the surgery, told reporters on Monday.

 As per the available records, the THR surgery on such a small person with little weight was not yet performed anywhere in the world and I will be approaching the record books (Guinness and Limca) to register it in their records, Goyal said.

 Thirty-two-year-old Acharya, a priest, was able to perform his duties till he was 27, when he began to feel pain in his hips which restricted his movement. Later, his hip joints got affected and he was unable to stand on his own and was forced to crawl, the doctor said.

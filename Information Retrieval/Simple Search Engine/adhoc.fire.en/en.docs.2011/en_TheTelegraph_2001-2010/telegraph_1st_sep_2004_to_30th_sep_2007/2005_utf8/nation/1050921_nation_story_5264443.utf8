 Green channel for foreign students

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The government is planning to relax rules for granting research visas to make it easier for foreign students to apply to Indian universities.

 According to home ministry officials, the Centre is working on a proposal to drop cumbersome pre-verification formalities and create a green channel for applicants who want to do research in non-controversial and non-strategic subjects.

 An exhaustive list of research subjects for the red channel and for the green channel has been drawn up in consultation with other ministries, a senior home official said.

 Subjects relating to Indian music, dance, arts, culture, animal studies and agriculture are among those to be put in the green channel.

 Whether an application would go through the green or the red channel will also depend on the applicants nationality and the location of the research project. 

 Under the list of strategic and non-strategic subjects, an applicant wanting to do research in nuclear physics or genetic engineering would automatically fall into the red channel. 

 Also, if the applicant belongs to a country with which India takes a cautious approach, they would again fall in the red channel. This would mean a processing time of up to three months because pre-verification would be required.

 For an application to be put in the green channel, all three criteria would have to be clean. For example, nationality: Australia, subject: PhD in Kuchipudi, location: Chennai.

 But since in most cases, the nationality and location are likely to qualify for the green channel, it is the research subject that will determine whether or not pre-verification is needed. At present, all applications for a research visa have to go through the red channel.

 A home ministry official said the human resource development, external affairs and space and technology ministries were also looking into the ramifications of various research topics. Subjects that might seem harmless initially could turn controversial later, he said. 

 If things fall into place and research visa rules are relaxed as medical and student visa norms have been, Indian universities could aim to become big foreign-exchange earners.

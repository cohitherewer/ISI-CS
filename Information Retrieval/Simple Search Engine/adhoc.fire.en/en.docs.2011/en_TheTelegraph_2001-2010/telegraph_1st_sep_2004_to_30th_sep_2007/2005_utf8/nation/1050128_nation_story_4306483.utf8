 Manmohan commando misfires

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: A Special Protection Group commando belonging to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s security ring injured another staffer when his gun ?accidentally? went off just after the Republic Day function.

 The incident triggered a security alert around 11.30 am yesterday as it occurred at the SPG armoury located within the Prime Minister?s residence at 7 Race Course Road. 

 S.P. Singh, attached to the training wing of the SPG, was depositing his weapon at the end of duty hour when it went off, injuring security officer Surender Vikram.

 Vikram was rushed to Safdarjung Hospital and is now in stable condition. 

 S.P. Singh was hurt in his hand in the gunfire and was discharged after medical attention. 

 While no FIR has been lodged, an entry has been made at the local police station. According to SPG sources, an internal inquiry has also been started.

 On Tuesday, Delhi police had registered a case of causing hurt due to negligence against a personal security officer who was arrested after similar accidental firing at the residence of an Israeli journalist at Sunder Nagar.

 The Prime Minister today hailed the National Cadet Corps for their ?magnificent service? in providing relief and rehabilitation to the tsunami victims, reports PTI.

 Poll fissures cast shadow on big picture

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The budget session may be three weeks away but the Assembly polls in the states of Haryana, Bihar and Jharkhand ? which begin tomorrow ? have cast their shadow over Parliament. 

 At stake are not just the fortunes of Sonia Gandhi, L.K. Advani and Laloo Prasad Yadav but the cohesion of the United Progressive Alliance. With the allies fighting one another in Bihar and to an extent in Jharkhand, questions have been raised on whether the division will be reflected in the conduct of Parliament or will get deepened when the railway and general budgets are subject to discussion and voting.

 The fissures have got most pronounced in Bihar where Laloo Prasad?s only ally from the UPA is the Left. The Congress and the Lok Janshakti Party have come in for almost as much attack in the RJD chief?s campaign as the NDA. 

 At the core of the disunity are three issues: the animosity between Laloo Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, which was temporarily buried during the Lok Sabha elections but resurfaced in the tussle on who would get the railway portfolio; excessive pressure from the Congress? Bihar unit to strike it alone and not hang on to Laloo Prasad?s coat tails; and as a corollary, the fight for the Muslim votes between the RJD, LJP and the Congress.

 Laloo Prasad is also battling a perceived ?anti-incumbency? sentiment, which came into focus during the spate of kidnappings of school students. The abductions were used by his opponents to justify their charge that under the 15 years of RJD rule, law and order was the worst casualty. But Laloo Prasad?s supporters waved away such charges as ?bogeys? raised by the upper castes and claimed that his Muslim-Yadav base, fortified by support from sections of Dalits, was intact. 

 Observers believe that while Laloo Prasad?s ?inadequacies? may get ?exposed? in Phase I and could adversely impact the RJD?s prospects, the negative trend could lead to a regrouping of his support in the second and third phases and see the RJD through for a fourth time.

 The NDA counted its textbook-perfect alliance as its biggest plus in Bihar. It hoped to cash in on the ?imperfections? in the UPA to swing the anti-RJD votes in its favour. But sources conceded that its caste base was not as ?formidable? as Laloo Prasad?s and that if political and social empowerment was the key to a win, the NDA was not as ?strong? as the RJD.

 BJP sources said if the LJP emerged as a clincher in the event of a hung Assembly, the NDA would have ?no problem? backing Paswan as chief minister. This was the reason why the coalition did not project Nitish Kumar as its chief ministerial candidate, wanting to keep a ?channel? open for Paswan.

 Though it looks like a straight win for the JMM-Congress-RJD group in Jharkhand ? if the Lok Sabha outcome is a barometer ? the half-hearted alliance may throw up a hung Assembly. 

 The BJP?s calculation was if it managed to pick up 20 or 25 seats, it would support Shibu Soren as chief minister. State leaders Babulal Marandi and Arjun Munda have been persuaded to endorse this strategy which, BJP leaders believe, was ?crucial? to the long-term calculation of picking up as many states as possible before the next Lok Sabha polls. 

 In Haryana, chief minister Om Prakash Chautala?s Indian National Lok Dal is fighting with its back to the wall to arrest what appears to be a ?wave? in favour of the Congress. Chautala has found no takers for his ?development? campaign. Unlike Digvijay Singh, who was unseated in Madhya Pradesh for not delivering on the ?BSP? (bijli, sadak, paani) plank, Chautala, observers believed, was strong on infrastructure. 

 The Haryana chief minister was on a slippery wicket because of the ?extra-constitutional? role played by his sons, the alleged extortions done by his relatives and failure to keep his promises. 

 Though riding on an ?anti-Chautala wave?, the Congress is plagued with infighting and counts at least six contenders for the chief minister?s post.

 Enemies in family stalk children

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, May 29: Children in India are less safe now, even if they are among their own.

 Violence against children has risen in the country despite 22 laws and six national policies, according to a report.

 Child abuse and neglect in the family has reached alarming proportions in India, says the report authored by the Centre and non-government organisations.

The number of cases went up from 6,866 in 2002 to 

8,064 in 2003, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. The records show 

a rise in cases of child rape, buying and selling of girls for prostitution, murders 

and abductions. 

 There have been a lot of positive laws and recommendations but there is no infrastructure and no funds to implement them, says Jyotsna Chatterjee of the Joint Womens Programme who participated in a recent meeting of South Asian government officials and activists where the report was presented.

 The government admits that violence against children within their own families is becoming a pattern. The scenario of violence against children in the Indian family is quite glaring and alarming, the report says. Reports of children being physically, sexually and emotionally exploited at home are not unknown. 

 A study conducted in Mumbai by Trupti Panchal and Nakida Shaikh says sexual assaults by minors or young boys are often glossed over lest they bring to light the inadequacies of the family and threaten its traditional glorified image. The government also admits it does not have the exact number of children who are victims of abuse.

 Girl children are more vulnerable. Discrimination can be seen in providing diet, education, care, the Centres report says. Malnutrition is more common among girls.

 One sure pointer is the sex ratio that fell from 945 in 1991 to 927 in 2001.

 The United Progressive Alliance governments common minimum programme talks about gender empowerment but does not make any specific commitments to protect the rights of children. However, the Centre has passed a bill to set up a national commission for children.

 Since 1974, there have been six national policies dealing with education, health and nutrition. More than two decades later, the previous National Democratic Alliance government laid down a national childrens charter. But NGOs paint a frightening picture.

 According to them, 25 per cent of victims of commercial sexual exploitation in India are below 18. Almost 15 per cent of prostitutes enter the sex trade before they are 15.

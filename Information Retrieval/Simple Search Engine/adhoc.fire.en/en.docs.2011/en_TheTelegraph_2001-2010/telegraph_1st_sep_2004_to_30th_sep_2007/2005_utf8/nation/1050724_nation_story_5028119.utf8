 Terror radar spots 1 more

 Thiruvananthapuram, July 23: The Kerala crime branch probing the suspected terror links of an Afghan and an Iranian have zeroed in on a third suspect.

 Police have identified him as Reza, an Iranian, but are tight-lipped on whether they have arrested him or were closing in. Alerts have been sent out to all exit point sleuths to look for the foreigner.

 A top crime branch source told The Telegraph that the third man left after ensuring that Jumar Khan of Afghanistan and Syed Dawoud Hashmi of Iran ? both are now in the custody of crime branch police ? boarded the Qatar Airways flight to Doha.

 But we have definite clues to his location since the mobile phone number from which he had rung up the travel agent was available, the source added. What we need to establish is the motive behind his arranging the trip for the duo.

 Khan, 23, and Hashmi, 47, landed in Doha on July 20. They were to take a connecting flight to London but were sent back to Thiruvananthapuram after it was found they were travelling on forged passports. After several rounds of questioning by the state police, Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the men were handed over to the crime branch.

 The crime branch police team is expected to leave for Delhi next week to check up on the details given by the detainees. Straightaway there is a suspicion because of discrepancies in dates of arrivals and their itinerary, said the source.

 A top RAW official said: The two guys are not just innocent characters who were trying to fly out to London for a living. Their forged passports are proof that they were up to something clandestine.

 It was a local travel agency that tipped off Thiruvananthapuram police about something being fishy. Joseph Mathew, general manager of Neyadi Travel amp; Tour Company, confirmed that an employee had conveyed her suspicions about the travellers to emigration authorities here.

 War of words over PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 6: The BJP has defended its description of Manmohan Singh as the ?weakest PM? independent India has had as a ?fact of life? and a ?statement of facts?.

 ?The PM is a highly able and competent person but he does not have the authority of a PM,? Jaswant Singh, leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said on the ninth day of the National Democratic Alliances Parliament boycott.

 The Congress, which has so far been muted in its defence of the Prime Minister, went ballistic today and answered the BJP word for word.

 Spokesperson Anand Sharma said: ?The BJP should have known it better that when A.B. Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, unfortunately senior leaders of his party called him a mukhota (mask).

 ?The PMs official residence was used to call RSS meetings and often official briefings for the media were done by RSS leaders. This was a Prime Minister who was openly dictated to and reprimanded by RSS leaders in and out of power.?

 Sharma said leader of Opposition L.K. Advani did not fare better vis-a-vis the Sangh. 

 ?Look at Advanis pitiable plight. He is the president of the party but all BJP chief ministers have to present themselves at the RSS headquarters where marks are given for their performance.?

 He said all decisions taken by Manmohan were intended to fulfil the commitment made in the common minimum programme. 

 By way of pointing out Manmohans use of prime ministerial ?authority?, Sharma mentioned the one-to-one meetings with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf.

 Sharma said Manmohan was the first Indian Prime Minister after 50 years to be selected from a galaxy of Afro-Asian leaders to speak on behalf of Asia at the Bangdung summit. ?(The) BJP should have acknowledged the pride India felt on this occasion,? he said.

 Sharma said Vajpayees diplomatic endeavours like the Lahore bus and the Agra summit had virtually come to naught. 

 ?This PM did not take a bus to Lahore, nor did he have an Agra summit. He simply flagged off a bus from Srinagar to the PoK.?

 As the war of words escalated, the BJP called a meeting at Vajpayees home to ?consider all aspects? of a statement made by Manmohan in the Rajya Sabha yesterday.

 Jaswant said Manmohan insisted the government could not be ?faulted? for not trying to end the House impasse, but its spokespersons ?have competed with each other in casting unfounded aspersions? on the Opposition.?

 Jaswant said Manmohan had ?no control? either over the government or the Congress.

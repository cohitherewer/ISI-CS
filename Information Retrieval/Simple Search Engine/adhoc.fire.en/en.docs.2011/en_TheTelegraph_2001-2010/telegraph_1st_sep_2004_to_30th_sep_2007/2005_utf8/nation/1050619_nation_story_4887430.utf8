 Jinnah battle hits Advani home turf

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Ahmedabad, June 18: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad today intensified its campaign against Lal Krishna Advani, floating a local organisation led by sadhus and mahants to force the BJP chief to give up his Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat.

 Mahant Avichaldas, who attended the just-concluded Hardwar convention of the margdarshak mandal, the VHPs top decision-making body, launched the Matvistar Sangh to mobilise public opinion against Advani for praising Pakistans founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

 The mahant, a popular religious figure in central Gujarats Anand district, said the fronts aim would be to either force the BJP chief to step down or retract the statements he made on his recent trip to Pakistan.

 At the moment, we do not consider Advani a Hindu representative as he has diluted his stand to wear a liberal mask, said the man who had ensured Shankersinh Vaghelas defeat in the Lok Sabha elections after he rebelled against the first BJP government in Gujarat in 1995. Perhaps, he is competing with Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 Sources said the mahant was briefed by top VHP leaders on how to launch an aggressive campaign against Advani in Gandhinagar. However, VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia, who had called Advani a traitor for his comments in Pakistan, sought to distance himself from the campaign.

 Togadia said the campaign is being led by sants, who are furious with Advani for his comment on the demolition of the Babri Masjid which he had described as the saddest day of his life. But, he hastened to add, we are fully backing Mahant Avichaldas, who has been mandated to lead the campaign.

 Ashwin Patel, one of the conveners of the front, justified the campaign, saying the leader who had sought votes in the name of Hindutva has turned his back on Hindus and shamelessly praised Jinnah.

 Patel said they would form a core group of 12 people to lead the campaign and highlight how the BJP leader has taken voters in Gandhinagar for a ride.

 To intensify the movement, the new outfit plans to hold a public meeting in Ahmedabad on June 20 which a galaxy of religious leaders are expected to attend.

 When contacted, most BJP leaders refused to comment on the VHPs latest move. But a senior leader, who is considered close to the BJP chief, dismissed the campaign as mere posturing. The movement, he said, would be short-lived as the VHP ? which owes its clout and existence, at least in Gujarat, to the ruling BJP ? cannot survive without the political party.

 The leader, however, conceded that the campaign would affect the morale of the BJP president who considers Gandhinagar a safe seat. Advani, he added, may not be able to visit his constituency for some time at least because of possible protests from VHP workers.

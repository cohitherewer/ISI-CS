 Cricket board ?friends? meet in Pakistan

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Feb. 8: The Pakistan Cricket Board today confirmed a meeting between its chairman and the BCCI vice-president but denied it had anything to do with the rejection of Ahmedabad as a Test venue.

 ?It was basically a meeting between the two friends,? Abbas Zaidi, a PCB spokesman, said and added that BCCI?s Rajiv Shukla was in Pakistan on a private visit.

 Last night?s meeting between Shukla and Shaharyar Khan took place hours after the PCB officially confirmed it had requested the BCCI to change Ahmedabad, one of the worst affected cities during the 2002 Gujarat riots, as a Test venue during Pakistan?s coming seven-week tour of India.

 ?We made this request after receiving the report of our security team that recently visited India,? Zaidi said, denying the move was politically motivated.

 ?In making the request, the PCB wished to preserve and strengthen the bilateral relations that have been enhanced at the public and government levels after resumption of cricketing series between the two countries,? he added.

 Zaidi, however, was reluctant to say if the meeting would help resolve the venue issue but hoped it would be settled in the next couple of days.

 Shukla, in Lahore to attend the wedding of the son of former Pakistan Prime Minister Shujat Hussain, told PTI over phone: ?We have held positive talks. I am hopeful that Pakistan will play in Ahmedabad.?

 BCCI secretary S.K. Nair was as hopeful when he said ?we will be flexible? and try to ?accommodate? the visiting team?s concerns. 

 ?We are discussing the issue with PCB officials. We have to find a solution that is acceptable to everyone,? he told the news agency over phone from Thiruvananthapuram.

 Shukla told a private Pakistani TV channel that ?we should draw a clear line between politics and sports?. He added that Hussain assured him to take up the issue with President Pervez Musharraf, who is the PCB patron-in-chief.

 Shaharyar was not immediately available for his comments on the meeting with Shukla. He had recently met Musharraf over the issue and been given a free hand to deal with it.

 Pakistan is due to play three Tests and five one-day games as well as two side matches on their first full tour of India in six years, starting later this month.

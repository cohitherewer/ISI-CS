 Court shield for postings

 New Delhi, March 1 (PTI): The Supreme Court has barred ministers and top bureaucrats of Uttar Pradesh from having any say in the postings of employees of the eight government electricity corporations. 

 The court said: ?Interference in transfers and postings with political patronage has totally destroyed the autonomous nature of the electricity board, which has been identified as a serious malaise affecting the functioning of the board.?

 The court passed the order on a petition filed by Suresh Chandra Sharma alleging largescale manipulation in postings in the electricity corporations.

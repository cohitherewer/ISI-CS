 NDA at Kalam door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: A delegation of National Democratic Alliance leaders met the President today with the demand to sack Bihar governor Buta Singh even as sparks flew from another man, hailed as a king-maker till a few months ago.

 Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan, whose 29 MLAs held the key in a hung House, blamed the NDA for central rule in Bihar and accused its leaders of kidnapping party legislators.

 They have absolutely no moral right now to go whining to the President, he said.

 The purpose of the NDAs meeting, BJP chief L.K. Advani said, was to let the President know that he was misled by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The NDA demanded that A.P.J. Abdul Kalam ask the Prime Minister to resign and recall the Bihar governor.

 We told the President that you have been misled by the (Union) cabinet. The PM has not substantiated the grounds on which the recommendation for dissolving the Bihar Assembly was made, Advani said.

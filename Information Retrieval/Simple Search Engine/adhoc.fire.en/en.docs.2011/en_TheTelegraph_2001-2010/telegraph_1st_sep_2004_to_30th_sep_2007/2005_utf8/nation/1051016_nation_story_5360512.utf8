 Oct. 15: Before the February polls, the Congress president had obliquely accused the Rashtriya Janata Dal of not doing enough for Bihar during its 15 years in office. Eight months later, sharing the campaign dais with the RJD chief, Sonia Gandhi blamed the National Democratic Alliance governments six-year rule at the Centre for Bihars backwardness.

 The NDA government discriminated against Bihar on all fronts. People suffered because of this. The UPA (United Progressive Alliance) government has made a new beginning and the good work will continue in Bihar, Sonia told a moderate gathering at Patnas Gandhi Maidan today.

 But her uneasiness at the change of stance was apparent at an earlier meeting in Gaya, where she was defensive as she justified the tie-up with Laloo Prasad Yadav.

 Without naming either the RJD or its chief, Sonia said fingers were being raised at the Congress over its political alliance in the state. But the arrangement had been made in the interests of the people of Bihar, especially the deprived sections and the minorities.

 Its not a matter of an individual (read Laloo Prasad); its a question of principles (read secularism), she said.

 The UPA chairperson, however, was certain of her alliances victory because the confusion of last time ? when no grouping got a clear mandate ? had vanished.

 There is no confusion now and I am sure you will support our alliance, she told the Patna audience flanked by Laloo Prasad and Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar.

 Sonia said the UPA government had opened a new chapter of change in the country and its natural corollary was the development of Bihar, provided her alliance came to power.

 Bihar needs a government that can care for each citizen. Bihar has problems and the environment in the state needs to be improved.

 She cited the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the Right to Information Act as examples of her governments commitment to change.

 The employment guarantee programme will be implemented across the country within five years. We believe in providing equal rights to women. The legislation to check domestic violence and to provide daughters an equal share in paternal property will help us meet this objective.

 Laloo Prasad said he had always believed that madam was, first of all, a bahu (daughter-in-law) and her supreme sacrifice ? that of declining the Prime Ministers chair ? had only strengthened his viewpoint.

 I have also struggled, but your sacrifice has mobilised people across the country. Bihar will change, he said.

 Ally Sharad Pawar declared that Bihar needed Laloo Prasad at the helm if it was to develop. The state needs a new programme and the path has already been shown by the UPA government at the Centre, the Union agriculture minister said.

 Sonia also addressed a meeting at Singhia in Samastipur.

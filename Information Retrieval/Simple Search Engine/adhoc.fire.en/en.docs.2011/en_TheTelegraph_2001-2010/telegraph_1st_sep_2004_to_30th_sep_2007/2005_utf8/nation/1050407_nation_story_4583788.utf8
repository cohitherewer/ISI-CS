The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Back to basics, not mascots

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Uma, Modi

 New Delhi, April 6: They were the rulers of Hindu hearts every time the BJP embarked on a course of communal politics, be it in Ayodhya or Gujarat.

 Today, as the BJP national council got underway to chart out a ?back to basics? agenda, two of the party?s ?Hindu hriday ka samrat (monarch of the Hindu heart)?, Kalyan Singh and Narendra Modi, sat listless. The third saffron mascot, Uma Bharti, was missing.

 Singh, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister when the Babri mosque was brought down, sat silently in the second row on the dais as party president L.K. Advani declared that the commitment to the ?reconstruction? of a Ram temple in Ayodhya remained ?total, unshakeable and irreversible?.

 Singh had quit the BJP following differences with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and returned on the eve of the last general elections, only to be made a vice-president, an ?honorary? post in the party hierarchy.

 As for Gujarat chief minister Modi, who is battling a fresh burst of dissidence from his own MLAs, Advani took a mild swipe at him without taking his name.

 In his presidential address, Advani said those heading governments should not neglect the party because ?government-party coordination was a pre-requisite for good governance?.

 The buzz was Modi would speak on the occasion but the BJP decided it was not ?wise? to allow one chief minister to speak and ignore the others. A sullen Modi refused to even give sound bites.

 Uma was on a ?fast? at Amarkantak, a pilgrimage centre on the banks of the Narmada in Madhya Pradesh. The sadhvi had reportedly got an earful from Advani for allegedly instigating some state legislators against chief minister Babulal Gaur and was told she would get no position ?on demand?.

 Sources close to Uma, however, said she went to Amarkantak to immerse the ashes of a follower, who reportedly went on a fast-unto-death in the run-up to the state elections to get Uma declared the chief minister.

 The woman, whose health was fragile, died midway through the fast. Her relatives were said to have waited for Uma to immerse the ashes.

 The sadhvi, preoccupied with official duties when she was chief minister, however, forgot about it. When she lost the job, friends reminded her that the woman?s ?soul? had not yet ?found peace? and she should promptly take the ashes to the Narmada.

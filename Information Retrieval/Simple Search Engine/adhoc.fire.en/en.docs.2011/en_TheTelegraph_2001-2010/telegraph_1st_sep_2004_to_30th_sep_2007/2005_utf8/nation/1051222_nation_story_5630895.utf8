 IAS performance whip 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The Centre may scrap reservations in civil service promotions and offer VRS to inefficient bureaucrats. 

 We are toying with several ideas. One could be keeping reservations only up to the entry level in the civil services, the chairperson of the second Administrative Reforms Commission said today. 

 After getting the job, only the merit of the candidate will decide his or her promotions. It will help get the best brains in the administration, M. Veerappa Moily added.

 The commission was formed in August 31 this year to prepare a blueprint for revamping the public administration system. It is likely to submit by March 2006 its recommendations on implementation of the information act and the rural job guarantee scheme, as well as on crisis management and public order.

 Moily hinted at a golden handshake policy for bureaucrats by mentioning Chinas example of getting rid of thousands of civil servants to increase efficiency. He also cited how the army maintains efficiency by assessing performance every 10 years.

 He said the commission agreed with the proposal for fixed tenures for top bureaucrats, but wanted to ensure that no inefficient officer took advantage of the policy.

 No one should enter the civil services (expecting) a permanent guarantee of employment. Perform or go should be the mantra.

 Asked about the measures suggested by the commission to protect bureaucrats from political pressure, he said: I completely agree that there is some political interference and we are working on how to reduce and remove it.

 The six-member panel will come out with recommendations on 13 subjects, including ethics in governance, strengthening financial management systems and effective administration at state, district and panchayat levels.

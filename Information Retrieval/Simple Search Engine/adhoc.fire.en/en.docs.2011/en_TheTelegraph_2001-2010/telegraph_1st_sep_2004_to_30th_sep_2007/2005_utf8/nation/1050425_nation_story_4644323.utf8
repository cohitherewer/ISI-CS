 Stage set for MLA trial

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, April 24: The stage is set for the trial of former minister Surendra Prasad Yadav and five others in the court of R.R. Mishra, the judicial magistrate of Gaya.

 The six have been accused of assaulting former MLA Jai Kumar Palit. The incident took place during a parliamentary bypoll in 1991. 

 Surendra Prasad has been languishing in Gaya Central Jail since his surrender on February 4 this year. On March 11, the Supreme Court rejected his bail petition.

 Keeping Surendra Prasad company during the trial would be Bindi Yadav and Bachhu Yadav, who had earlier been booked under the Bihar Control of Crime Act. 

 While Bindi is the chairman of the Zilla Parishad at present, Bachchu is the deputy mayor of Gaya Municipal Corporation. Surendra Prasad?s brother Pappu and former associate Abid have been declared absconders in the case and a separate file has been opened to facilitate early trial of the jailed accused.

 Now that charges have been framed and the trial is set to begin, all eyes are fixed on the witnesses, particularly Palit, the complainant. 

 Besides the imminent trial, Surendra Prasad has made himself vulnerable to the charge of deliberate concealment of facts and filing of allegedly false affidavit at the time of nominations for the Assembly elections. 

 In his declaration made before the returning officer, Surendra Prasad had not mentioned the pendency of a case (no. 312/92) lodged at Civil Lines police station. Though he subsequently won the Belaganj seat by defeating his Lok Janshakti Party rival Md Amjad, the alleged concealment of facts is likely to put him in trouble. 

 According to legal experts, the priority for Surendra Prasad is to retrieve himself from the legal knot during the trial. On their part, Gaya police will have to provide adequate security to the witnesses.

 In 2003, the Belaganj MLA had been in jail in connection with the alleged abduction of Atul Prakash, a Gujarat-based businessman, from police custody. Prakash was allegedly tortured to reveal the whereabouts of his brother, accused of decamping with money belonging to influential politicians of the state.

 End of road for snake charmers

 Bhopal, Aug. 10: Snakes will no longer curl out of wicker baskets to the sound of music.

 The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh today marked Nag Panchami, when the fanged reptiles are offered milk by devotees across the country, by announcing a ban on snake charmers.

 The festival, celebrated on the fifth day of the moonlit-fortnight in the month of Shravan, falls in a season serpents invariably come out of their flooded holes to seek shelter in homes and gardens. 

 As this poses danger to people, charmers go from door to door trapping snakes and on this day collect money by displaying their catch.

 The charmers reacted angrily to the ban and cursed chief minister Babulal Gaur with his governments downfall.

 Ramesh Nath, a charmer, said the order was alien to Hindu culture. In India, even before the Vedic times, the tradition of snake worship was in vogue, he added. 

 Today, snakes are our breadwinners and we have been catching them for generations. We do not have any other talent to earn money. The government should either withdraw its decision or provide us with a source of income.

 The ban order came in the wake of a request from an Indore-based animals rights activist, Sudhir Khetawat, who wrote to Gaur and state police chief Swaraj Puri a few days ago saying snake charmers should be arrested. 

 Acting on the plea, Gaur ordered Puri to direct all the 48 district police chiefs to arrest charmers for carrying or displaying snakes.

 In his letter, Sudhir claimed that thousands of snakes are caught before the Nag Panchami festival and their fangs brutally removed. The gangrene that sets in finally leads to a painful death for the reptiles, he said. 

 Sudhir also alleged that snakes were not properly fed in the tiny baskets.

 The activists plea gained momentum after the tragic death of Imrana, a Bhopal-based snake woman, yesterday. The 24-year-old died while displaying snakes at an exhibition.

 Imrana had the reptiles wrapped around and was explaining to a group of children that snakes bite only when provoked. Suddenly a cobra slipped away and, as she tried to catch it, the snake bit her. Instead of rushing to a hospital, Imrana asked another snake expert to treat her. The so-called expert used young hens to suck out the venom. As many as 24 hens were killed as the treatment went on for a few hours before Imrana succumbed.

 The Nag Panchami festival is an important occasion at Ujjains Mahakaleswar temple, famous for tantrik practices.

 Today, several ceremonies were held starting with bhasm aarti ? the only one of its kind in the country. It is said that the ash with which the Shiva lingam is bathed every morning should be that of a corpse that has been cremated the day before.

 If no cremation has taken place in the temple town, the ash must be obtained at all costs from the nearest cremation ground. 

 Temple authorities, however, say though it was once customary for the ash to belong to a fresh corpse, the practice had long been discontinued. But pilgrims travel long distances to watch the ceremony in the belief that those who are fortunate to be there never die a premature death.

 The top floor of the Mahakaleswar temple remains closed to the public throughout the year. But on Nag Panchami, the floor with its two snake images ? said to be sources of tantrik power ? is thrown open to people who come to seek the marvel of Gorakhnath, a deity said to be blessed with miraculous powers.

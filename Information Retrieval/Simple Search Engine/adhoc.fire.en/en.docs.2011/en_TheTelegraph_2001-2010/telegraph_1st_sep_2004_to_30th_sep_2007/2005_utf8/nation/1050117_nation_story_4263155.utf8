 Jaya sticks to seer duty, snaps at BJP

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Jayalalithaa: Without fear

 Coimbatore, Jan. 16: Hours before Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati broke his week-long vow of silence, Jayalalithaa released a statement reiterating that her government was doing its duty in pursuing the cases against the Kanchi pontiffs and ruled out withdrawing them. 

 She snapped at the BJP, insinuating that it was trying to ?politically rehabilitate itself? by taking up the cudgels for the Kanchi pontiffs, both accused in a murder case. The thrust drew a counter in Delhi, with BJP spokesperson V.K. Malhotra reiterating that the move was ?driven by revenge?. 

 ?It is all a case of vengeance. The minimum courtesies which had to be extended to them were not. In the past, when any eminent person was arrested, be it Indira Gandhi, Sheikh Abdullah or BJP leaders, they were housed in guest houses and not jails. Even the Prime Minister wrote to her twice, saying the traditions of the mutt should not be broken,? he said. 

 Jayendra Saraswati has been granted conditional bail by the Supreme Court and is camping at Kalavai, 45 km from Kancheepuram. The bail application of junior acharya Vijayendra Saraswati will come up at the Chengalpattu sessions court tomorrow. 

 In the hard-hitting seven-page statement released in Chennai, Jayalalithaa defended the ?systematic and meticulous? police investigation into a sensitive case involving the ?brutal murder? of temple manager Shankar Raman. 

 Jayalalithaa repeated that in acting to uphold law and order, she was only discharging her duties as chief minister ?without any fear or favour, which is what the oath of office would require any person in her position to do?. 

 She pointed out that the Shankar Raman murder, an assault on Kanchi Mutt associate Radhakrishnan in Chennai and an earlier attack on priest Thirukoshtiyur Madhavan by strangers who had ?no relationship whatsoever with the victims? had posed a great challenge to police. 

 After painstaking investigation, a pattern emerged. ?When certain names behind these attacks were first brought to my notice, I was totally shocked and pained,? she said. 

 ?Nobody expected nor would anybody find it palatable that the two sankaracharyas as peetathipathis of the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt would so seriously deviate from the path of Hindu shastras? and be included as accused in a murder case,? the statement said. 

 ?But at the same time, when the evidentiary materials backing the charges turns the needle of suspicion against the acharyas, things cannot be left as they are.?

 Jayalalithaa seems to have hardened her stand following statements from the mutt devotees and the BJP?s charge that her government was ?going berserk? in the case. 

 ?Maintenance of law and order makes no distinction between the rich and poor, between a religious head and an atheist,? she said, pointing out that some ?groups and vested interests (were) actively manipulating the media to spread misinformation?. 

 She said that ?there was absolutely no role for her intervention or interference in this case? and that as chief minister in charge of the police, she was being informed about the case only on a ?strictly need-to-know basis?. 

 The BJP seems to think, she said, religious heads like the acharyas were ?above the law, that they could not be questioned or any investigation pressed against them?. 

 ?Only the people should judge whether the BJP?s stand on this issue is correct or erroneous,? she said, adding that the BJP knows the law well enough to be aware that the cases cannot be withdrawn.

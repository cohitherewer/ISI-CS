 Shield against botched sterilisation

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: Sterilisation failure? Insurances here. 

 Under pressure from the Supreme Court, the government today announced an insurance plan to cover complications or failure after sterilisation operations.

 An agreement signed today between the health ministry and the Oriental Insurance Company will introduce insurance cover for both those who opt for sterilisation and doctors who conduct the operations.

 The new scheme, to be implemented in government and accredited private and corporate health centres, provides for Rs 100,000 for death due to sterilisation in hospital, and Rs 20,000 for death after sterilisation within 30 days after discharge. It will also provide for Rs 20,000 for failure of sterilisation ? conception after operation ? and Rs 20,000 for complications within 60 days of the surgery.

 Under existing government rules, no compensation was payable for the failure of sterilisation and no indemnity cover was provided to doctors who conduct sterilisation operations. 

 Doctors have said the compensation is too meagre for this day and age. Rs 1 lakh compensation for death is grossly inadequate, said Dr S.K. Sama, chairman of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi, an accredited centre for sterilisation.

 Death following sterilisation is very rare and the compensation should thus be significantly higher, Sama said. Something like Rs 5 lakh... would have been more appropriate.

 The new scheme will also indemnify doctors and health facilities that offer family planning services. It will provide up to Rs 200,000 per doctor for claims emerging from failure of sterilisation, death or medical complications.

 Earlier this year, the Supreme Court had ordered the formation of a uniform insurance policy for compensation for death following sterilisation operations. The court had also ordered that doctors with at least five years experience in gynaecology alone should perform sterilisation operations. The court ruling was in response to a petition seeking guidelines for sterilisation procedures.

 A number of government doctors have faced litigation from patients who had suffered complications or failure after sterilisation. Such cases have led to reluctance among doctors in conducting these operations.

 The new insurance scheme will do away with the tedious process of payment of ex gratia to those who opt for sterilisation, the health ministry said.

 A national family health survey during the late 1990s had indicated that 48 per cent of couples in India falling within the reproductive age group practice family planning. Female sterilisation accounted for 34 per cent and male sterilisation was less than 2 per cent.

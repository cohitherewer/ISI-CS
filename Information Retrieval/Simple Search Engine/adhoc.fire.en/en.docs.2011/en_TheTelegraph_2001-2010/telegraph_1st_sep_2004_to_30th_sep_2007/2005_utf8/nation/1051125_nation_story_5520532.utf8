 Lucknow, Nov. 24: Police today claimed to have arrested a Dubai-based sharpshooter, allegedly a member of Dawood Ibrahims gang and one of those who had made the attempt on rival don Chhota Rajans life in Bangkok.

 Noor Baksh alias Ali Baksh was caught from Cool Break hotel in Lucknows Hazratganj, where he has been staying for the past one week, after he made several calls to top Dawood associates.

 The police said Baksh, originally from Baluchistan in Pakistan, had lived for many years in Dubai working for Dawood. He, however, spent the best part of the past five years in Indian jails, twice escaping but being re-arrested.

 After the third arrest today, the special task force (STF) seized from him a mobile phone, a passport ? apparently forged ? and five receipts for calls made to D-company top guns like Dawoods brother Anees Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel.

 The police suspect Baksh ? who has several other aliases such as Abdulla, Yasin Baluchi and Noor Mohammad ? was here to murder gangster Babloo Srivastava, now in Bareilly jail. Another target, they think, could be Abu Salem or one of his brothers.

 Noor Baksh was first arrested in India in 2000 ? in Lucknow in connection with a passport forgery. In May 2001, he escaped from Naini jail in Allahabad.

 He was rearrested and convicted in a case in Bangalore, but this year on October 18, he escaped from Itarsi railway station while on transit in police custody.

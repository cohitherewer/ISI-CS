 Back home after months

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, April 11: After months of anxiety, Balram could finally breathe easy. 

 His 35-year-old sister Lata (name changed), wife of the late Prannath Kathuria of Nadiapar village in Nagaon of Assam, had been missing since August 18, 2004. Months later, an elderly couple spotted the woman, almost lifeless, on March 1 near a canal at Parathia Tola in Dhumnagar panchayat in Bihar?s West Champaran and took her home.

 The couple, who had no idea about the identity of the woman, attended on her for two days before other family members started exerting pressure to get rid of her.

 A local village women?s group stepped in and got Lata admitted in MJK Hospital, Bettiah, with the help of READ, an NGO. Volunteers of Prakash Seva Kendra, the NGO run by filmmaker Prakash Jha, took special care of the woman at the hospital.

 A trio of nuns from the Holy Cross soon developed a special liking for Lata. ?She uttered the first word, her name, on the third day after continuous prodding. She showed signs of some mental disorder. The sight of men would scare her to death. I persisted and on the 10th day I managed to get the full address of her residence. She spoke in half-Bengali and half-Assamese,? said Sister Hilda. 

 Soon, READ got in touch with the Northeast Social Research Centre, an associate organisation in Guwahati. It then contacted associates in Nagaon district, who visited Lata?s house and informed her family. 

 The woman?s brother and another relative rushed to Bettiah on hearing the news. ?It was a sight to see how Lata jumped out of the bed and hugged Balram,? Sister Hilda recalled. 

 Lata was discharged from the hospital on March 21 and she left for Assam with her brother the same evening.

 ?It is like a rebirth for my sister? you all are angels who have come down from heaven,? Lata?s brother Balram told the hospital staff and NGO volunteers before boarding the train. 

 The NGO kept the local police informed but did not file a complaint. On March 21, the police visited the hospital and took Lata?s statement before she was discharged. 

 No one seemed to know what happened to Lata while she was away from home and how she ended up in Bettiah. ?She hardly gave any information in her statement. Besides, her relatives were not keen to pursue a case,? a police source said. 

 Recounting Lata?s story, Balram said, ?Death of her husband Prannath and two others of the family on the same day three years ago upset her badly. Not looked after by her in-laws, she started to work to support her family of five children.?

 ?She used to come to our home in Lanka village, not far from her in-laws? place, to collect ration. It was on one such trip that she went missing. We looked for her for 15 days and then informed police, but to no avail,? he added.

 The Northeast Social Research Centre has now decided to rehabilitate Lata. ?Her mental state will require some medical attention. We have also heard that her in-laws are trying to throw her out and grab her husband?s property,? director Walter Fernandes said over phone.

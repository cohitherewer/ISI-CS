 Naxalite blow to Paswan front

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswans dreams of cobbling together a third front in Bihar seem to have been shattered by the most powerful constituent of this front, the CPI(ML).

 The CPI(ML) general secretary, Deepankar Bhattacharya, has said the only understanding his party has reached so far is with the CPI. 

 Contrary to Paswans claims, he said, the CPI(ML) has no understanding with the LJP as of now. Weve had seat-sharing talks only with the CPI. About 120 seats have been discussed. They are free to do what they want in the rest of the seats. 

 So far as Paswan is concerned, there is no possibility of any alliance with him as long as he keeps appealing to the Congress to join him. He has to distance himself from the Congress.

 The CPI(ML) had won seven seats in the last Assembly elections. According to Bhattacharya, the party has a strong presence in at least 50 Assembly seats. 

 But all of it does not get reflected in the election results because elections are a very unequal battle for us. In terms of the money spent, the muscle power and the state apparatus parties like the RJD use, we are at a disadvantage. 

 But still, we have a presence because ours is the only party that has taken a consistent ideological stand against criminalisation of the state and corruption in Bihar. We have fought with the corrupt and ideologically bankrupt parties for 20 years and people recognise that now, he said. 

 Bhattacharya has floated the idea of a combined Left front in Bihar with the CPI(ML), CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc. He said the LJP cannot be a part of this combination as long as Paswan keeps his ties intact with the Congress.

 Bhattacharya said the CPI wants to keep its alliance with Paswan while having an understanding with the CPI(ML) on a large number of seats. 

 We are looking at a strong Left assertion in Bihar. If the CPI draws some lesson from the last polls and works with us wholeheartedly, there is no reason why we will not do well in Bihar. Democratic revival of the Left will happen from Bihar, the most crucial state in the Hindi heartland. Our comrades in the local unit of the CPI also agree with this. 

 D. Raja, the CPIs national secretary, said the decision will be taken in a two-day meeting beginning September 16. 

 It is true that we have had extensive talks with the CPI(ML) and there is a broad Left alliance. The CPI(ML) has made its position clear vis-?-vis Paswan. But we dont necessarily share their views about the LJP. We will have a final look at the situation in our forthcoming meeting, Raja said.

 According to the CPI(ML), Paswans third front in the last elections was a Congress creation. Paswan has localised pockets of influence in areas like Samastipur, Vaishali etc. in north Bihar. But last time, he won three seats in Jehanabad which has traditionally been a Congress stronghold. People like Ram Asrey Singh, a die-hard Congressman, joined Paswan. A lot of Bhumihars supported him. There was a convergence of all sorts of powerful interests. But that is not the case this time. Of the 29 MLAs he had, 22 have left him. Paswan is surely not going to get the same support. The CPI should learn from this and come with us wholeheartedly, Bhattacharya said.

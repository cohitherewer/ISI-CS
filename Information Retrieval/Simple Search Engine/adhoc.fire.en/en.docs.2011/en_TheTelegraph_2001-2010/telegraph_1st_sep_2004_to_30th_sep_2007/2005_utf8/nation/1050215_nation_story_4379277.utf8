 World Bank whip on YSR

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: The World Bank is playing tough with the Andhra Pradesh government. It has refused to sanction Rs 4,000 crore to the state on the ground that its reform guidelines are not being adhered to.

 The Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government had sought Rs 1,610 crore for irrigation projects, Rs 1,690 crore for power and Rs 1,610 crore for the healthcare sector. It had also requested that an additional Rs 3,000 crore be diverted for major and minor irrigation projects.

 Although the funds are part of a Rs 25,000-crore structural adjustment loan framework agreed to with the N. Chandrababu Naidu regime, the bank is going slow on Reddy?s request. It had released one-fourth of the loan amount in two instalments to the Desam government.

 The bank is unhappy with various populist announcements Reddy made on the eve of the May general elections, including free power for farmers and discontinuation of user charges in irrigation in the urban/municipal sector.

 In talks last Friday with government and Andhra officials, including chief secretary Mohan Kanda, the bank?s country director Michael Carter said loans would be withheld until reforms were revived in each of these sectors.

 On Thursday, Reddy had knocked on Union finance minister P. Chidambaram?s door for help, but to no avail.

 Before that, the bank?s South Asian region director, Praful Patel, had held six rounds of talks with state government officials. 

 Sources said Patel had tried to convince Reddy to modify the free power policy.

 Some of the chief minister?s announcements under the bank?s scanner are:

 Free power to the farmers

 Failure to collect user 

 charges from minor and major farmers using the canal system 

 of irrigation

 Discontinuation of collection 

 of user charges from indoor and outdoor patients in government-run 

 hosp- itals 

 Major irrigation projects.

 During the Desam regime, the bank had appointed a commission to study the viability of big dams. 

 The panel had opposed lending for these dams as they raised environmental concerns and displaced a large number of people.

 Under pressure from the bank, the Desam government had set up a Water Users? Association to collect the charges. 

 The association, constituted by an act of the Assembly, had succeeded in collecting as much as 90 per cent of the charges.

 Under Reddy?s government, the collection fell to 40 per cent, much to the displeasure of the bank. The bank has asked the state to address these concerns.

 The inability to pay user charges was one of the reasons for the high rate of suicides among farmers during the Desam regime and in the early days of Reddy?s rule.

 Jayathi Ghosh, professor of economic development studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, had been appointed by the Reddy government to undertake a study into farmers? suicides.

 Over 1,400 farmers had committed suicide in the last two years of the Desam regime. 

 About 1,000 took their lives in the first eight months of the Reddy regime.

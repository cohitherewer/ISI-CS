 Minister brazen but no-vote case springs to life

 OUR BUREAU

 April 11: On a day the Supreme Court admitted a petition seeking the right to negative vote, a harassed state minister burst out that politicians are not bound to fulfil every promise made in the hustle and bustle of vote-catching.

 Snowed under complaints from villagers about jobs not done over the past 11 months, Andhra panchayati raj minister J.C. Diwakar Reddy exploded that ?no political party on earth can ever deliver everything it has promised to the people?.

 Reddy was participating in the third round of Praja Patham ? a programme for constituents to tell legislators their grievances, for which a solution would be offered on the spot ? in his constituency Tadipatri in Anantpur district.

 When some villagers persistently nagged him about houses not built, land not given and jobs not offered despite promises made ahead of last May?s Assembly elections, Reddy blew his fuse.

 ?Why are you telling me again and again that I have not fulfilled this promise or that promise? No political party on earth can fulfil everything it has promised. Even the Telugu Desam did not fulfil more than 50 per cent of the assurances it made in its 1999 poll manifesto,? he yelled.

 Not that Reddy said something people have not known all along. His outburst simply confirmed the cynical view people have of politicians, making the proposal for the right to vote for none look more relevant.

 In the Supreme Court, a petition by the People?s Union of Civil Liberties seeking the right to negative vote was admitted. The petition said in some cases no contesting candidate was worth voting for and an example could be taken from a couple of states in the United States that had legalised this right.

 The Election Commission backed today?s petition, saying it had written to the government twice ? in 2001 and 2004 ? to bring an amendment that would give voters this right. But the negative voting proposal is not likely to go far as no party is willing to support it.

 In Andhra Pradesh, the Praja Patham programme ? legislators accompanied by state officials tour their constituencies to give an ear to aggrieved villagers ? ran into trouble in two districts in Telengana. In Medak, angry villagers pelted stones on the officials. In Mahboobnagar, they were boycotted.

 The Andhra government has identified six areas in which grievances of the people will be addressed: drinking water, employment, irrigation, rural power, horticulture and housing.

 ?We have authorised legislators to sanction works worth Rs50 lakh each during the month-long campaign so that issues not addressed in the budgeted plan can be resolved on the spot,? chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy said.

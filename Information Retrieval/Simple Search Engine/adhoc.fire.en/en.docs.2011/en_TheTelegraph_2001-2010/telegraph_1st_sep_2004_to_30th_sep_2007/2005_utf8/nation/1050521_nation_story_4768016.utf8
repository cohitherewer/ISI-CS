 Crime costs first MLA job

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Lucknow, May 20: The Uttar Pradesh governor has disqualified an MLA convicted of murder, striking a blow against criminalisation of politics.

 Governor T.V. Rajeswar took the decision, the first of its kind, in consultation with the Election Commission.

 A communiqu? issued today said Uday Bhan Singh, the Samajwadi Party MLA from Aurai, near Varanasi, had been disqualified under Section 8 (4) of Representation of the People Act, 1951, as he was sentenced to life imprisonment in a murder case. 

 The disqualification order, signed yesterday, is with effect from January 28, 2005, the day the Supreme Court dismissed Uday Bhans appeal against the conviction.

 Uday Bhan, who is facing 18 criminal cases, had contested the 2002 polls as a Bahujan Samaj Party candidate while in jail and won. The following year, he switched loyalty to the Samajwadi Party along with 39 others when Mulayam Singh Yadav was poaching MLAs to form the government.

 In 2002, Uday Bhan was convicted by a court in Bhadoi, the district near Varanasi where he belongs, of the murder of an advocate, N. Shukla, and sentenced to jail for life. The MLA appealed against the conviction. But the district judge of Varanasi, Allahabad High Court and finally the Supreme Court refused to reverse the sentence.

 Sarvesh Narayan Shukla, a relative of the slain advocate, moved a petition before the Uttar Pradesh governor on February 7, praying for the disqualification of the Aurai MLA under the Representation of People Act, 1951, on the grounds of his life imprisonment in a murder case. The governor sought the opinion of the poll panel in March.

 On May 18, the governors house received a communication recommending disqualification. The poll panel suggested that the ruling party legislator be disqualified with effect from January 28, 2005, when the apex court had rejected his appeal.

 Rajeswar today issued the order and directed his office to print it in the official gazette and circulate seven copies among relevant offices, including that of the Speaker of Uttar Pradesh Assembly and the state election office.

 Reacting to the order, T.S. Mehta, senior Samajwadi leader and secretary to the chief minister, said: The disqualification is a constitutional process taking effect. All we can do is to respect this. 

 Opposition parties welcomed the decision. 

 The Samajwadi Party should learn a lesson. This is a warning to all political parties eager to distribute tickets to candidates having criminal records, said Akhilesh Pratap Singh of the Congress.

 The BJPs Kesrinath Tripathi said: We welcome the governors move. This is clearly a wake-up call to all political parties.

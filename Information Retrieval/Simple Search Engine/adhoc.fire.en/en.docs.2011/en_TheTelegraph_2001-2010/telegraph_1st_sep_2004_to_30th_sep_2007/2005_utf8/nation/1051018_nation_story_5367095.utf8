 Militants kill CPM leader

 Srinagar, Oct. 17 (PTI): CPM leader Ghulam Nabi Ganai was shot dead by militants in Anantnag district today.

 Ganai, 53, who unsuccessfully contested the last Assembly elections, was shot outside a mosque near his house at Seer-hamdan village of Mattan, 65 km from here, around 2.45 pm, police sources said.

 Ganai was rushed to a hospital where he was declared brought dead. He was talking to some villagers when the assailants shot him from point blank range.

 Although the state government had provided two personal security officers to him, neither of them was present as Ganai had reportedly asked them to visit their homes this morning, the sources said.

 State CPM secretary and MLA M.Y. Targami said Ganai had been demanding adequate security cover over the past several years but the state government paid no heed.

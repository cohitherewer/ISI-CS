 New Delhi, July 14: The 

 government is giving finishing touches to a plan to hand 

 over Metro Railway security to a central force in the wake 

 of the London bombings. 

 The Central Industrial Security Force, which guards the countrys airports, is expected to take charge of the tube security in both Calcutta and Delhi.

 Calcuttas underground security is now under Metro police, a force that is part of the city police. After the London explosions, the Railway Protection Force has been helping out in guarding the Metro.

 The ministry has almost finalised a plan to give the security arrangements for Delhi and Calcutta Metro to the CISF. We plan to give the internal security of the Metro to the CISF, while the outer periphery will remain with Delhi police, Union minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal said.

 The local police, too, will be in charge outside Calcuttas Metro stations. 

 The CISF has made a presentation of the security drill to the home ministrys Special Task Force, set up a day after the London blasts to assess the Metro security risks.

 The Union home secretary had said after the London blasts that intelligence agencies received inputs on threats to the Metro services.

 Jaiswal said the cost of deploying the CISF would have to be borne by the Delhi and Bengal governments.

 Air passengers have to shell out Rs 200 as security fee. It is not known whether any charge is in the offing for Metro users.

 The Metro in Calcutta has put in place some precautionary measures like reducing the number of exits at stations. Delhi had earlier spent crores on security systems but the police feel that X-ray scanners should be placed at entry points.

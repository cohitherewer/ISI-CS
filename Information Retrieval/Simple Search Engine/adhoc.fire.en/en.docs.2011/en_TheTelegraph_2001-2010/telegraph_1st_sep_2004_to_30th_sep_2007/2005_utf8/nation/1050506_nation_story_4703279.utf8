 RJD women support for Shahabuddin

 ASHISH SINHA

 Shahabuddin: Fair power

 Patna, May 5: With Pappu Yadav shifted to Tihar Jail in Delhi, everyone seems to have forgotten the Rashtriya Janata Dals Madhepura MP who does not, anyway, have many well-wishers left in Laloo Prasad Yadavs party. But, the case of controversial Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin is somewhat different.

 First, because the MP, debarred from entering Siwan for a few more months, is free on bail and also since he has a good number of supporters inside the RJD, who try to rake up the matter of ?injustice? done to him at regular intervals.

 While demonstrations and protests to support Shahabuddins ?cause? have hardly been held in Siwan, regular attempts have been made to keep the issue alive in the capital. Yet another protest was organised, this time by the RJDs womens wing, in the city today where his supporters demanded immediate stopping of his ?victimisation? by the district administration.

 Siwan district magistrate Chandrakant Kumar Anil, assisted by superintendent of police Ratan Sanjay, have taken on Shahabuddin, better known as the ?Siwan sultan?, on his home turf. The MPs houses have been raided, cases lodged against him and some of his alleged henchmen taken into custody as part of the crackdown which began just before this years Assembly elections.

 Both officers, whose popularity has grown by leaps and bounds in Siwan, have been repeatedly spared the transfer rod despite pressure from the highest political quarters. Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam has, in fact, praised the work done by the duo in ensuring the rule of law in the district, where Shahabuddins writ was law until a few months ago.

 Todays protest came with a ?warning? for the governor himself wherein the organisations general secretary, Shahjahan Khatun, said if Buta Singh fails to tame the district administration, the workers will lay an ?indefinite? siege to the Siwan district headquarters.

 ?Shahabuddin is the undisputed leader of the minorities in the state. The political attacks on him, along with the Tughlaqi orders of the Siwan administration, constitute an attack on the minorities. The Mahila RJD has prepared itself to make the biggest of sacrifices to defend his honour,? Khatun said.

 ?The district magistrate and the police superintendent should mend their ways before it is too late. Otherwise, no one will be able to stop Bihar from burning,? the organisations vice-president, Sushma Sinha, said.

 A few days ago, Samajik Nyaya Morcha, a little-known outfit, organised a protest in support of the Siwan MP. It also attempted to stop the governors cavalcade. The morchas colour became evident when Patna MP Ram Kripal Yadav was seen leading the demonstration at one point.

 The RJD, however, has not joined the protest openly although Laloo Prasad has made some statements against the ?excesses? of the Siwan administration. When senior RJD leader and former minister Shivanand Tiwari, who too had been debarred from entering Siwan, attempted to defy the district magistrates orders, he was not offered open support by his party.

 Reports from Siwan said attempts made to call a general strike by Shahabuddins supporters recently did not receive support from the traders and shopkeepers. ?The earlier reign of terror has become history. But the people are still not ready to speak out openly because Shahabuddin is bound to return sooner or later,? a local lawyer said.

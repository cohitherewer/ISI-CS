 Catch of ?crore? in drug raid

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 7: Patna police today seized suspected stolen medicines, including some labelled ?physician?s sample?, after conducting raids on nine drugstores and other places in the city.

 Police said the medicines seized are worth over a crore. Though they arrested four persons, the alleged mastermind, Naresh Gupta, managed to escape. 

 ?The medicines seized from Gupta?s house and some shops are worth a crore. We suspect that most of the medicines were looted from Kadamkuan a few days ago and labelled ?doctors? sample?,? deputy superintendent of police Rakesh Dubey said.

 ?Cases will be lodged against the accused soon for illegal trade of medicines,? he added. 

 ?Even if the stock is legal, one cannot possess medicines labelled ?doctors? sample?,? drug control board official Madan Mohan Prasad said.

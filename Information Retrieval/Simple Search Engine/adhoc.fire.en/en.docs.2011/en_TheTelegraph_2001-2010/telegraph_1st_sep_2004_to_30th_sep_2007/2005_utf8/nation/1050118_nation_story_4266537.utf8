 Autonomy panel fillip for J amp;K

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: Union home minister Shivraj Patil today announced the UPA government?s decision to set up a committee to revisit demands for greater autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir.

 This signals a departure from the position of the National Democratic Alliance government which had junked the Jammu and Kashmir State Autonomy Committee?s report.

 The new panel is likely to be headed by the Centre?s interlocutor on Kashmir, N.N. Vohra. Patil announced the setting up of the committee after a 45-minute meeting with former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah and his son, the National Conference chief Omar Abdullah, who last raised the autonomy demand before the NDA government five years ago.

 The National Conference has been promised a seat on the panel but it is not known if the People?s Democratic Party-led state government will be offered one. Officials said the Centre had asked the state government to come up with autonomy proposals but the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed regime, which has been pushing the Centre to engage the separatists, did not appear keen. 

 However, as the separatists wait for the right time to come to Delhi for the talks, the government has come round to the position that there is no reason why it should not consider demands of groups that have not questioned the state?s accession to India. 

 ?The logic is clear and simple, that if the Centre can talk to those seeking independence and accession to Pakistan, then why leave National Conference?s demand which is within the four walls of the Constitution,? Patil said.

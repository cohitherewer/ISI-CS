 Salute to daring tsunami saviour

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Aug. 21: One died while bringing the universe closer to man. The other saved hundreds from a raging sea.

 Yet, as she stepped on the dais during the Independence Day celebrations to receive the prize for courage that the other young woman has lent her name to, R. Meera neither broke down nor seemed happy.

 Meera, who had rushed towards the sea last December to warn about 500 people as the tsunami sped inland, hardly spoke, too. She just shook hands with Jayalalithaa when the chief minister handed her the Kalpana Chawla Award for Courage and Daring Enterprise for Women, in memory of the astronaut who was killed in the Columbia spacecraft crash two years ago.

 The price, after all, was too great. If the crash was a tragedy, the disaster that brought out her daring had wrecked thousands of lives.

 When the first waves struck her coastal village of Samiyarpatti in Cuddalore district on the morning of December 26, Meera, without caring for her life, ran to the seashore.

 Run towards the land, the frail, 40-something Meera had yelled before the giant waves swept in. Precious lives were saved this way, said the citation that accompanied the state government-instituted award, which carries a purse of Rs 5 lakh and a medal.

 Meeras training as a member of the forewarning committee under the village-level disaster management plan came in handy as she sensed the impending disaster. 

 But nothing had prepared her for the ferocity of the sea when it swelled again after the first waves had lashed the shore.

 Meera managed to save herself by clinging to the gate of a house near the shore. Even then, she continued her service with exemplary courage and bravery and saved more lives by taking efforts to rescue others who were struggling in the water, the citation said.

 She held the hands of at least four others and pulled them to safety inside the house.

 Meera thanked god for the award. I am extremely happy and thankful for this. I will use the amount for the education of my only daughter, she said. Her daughter studies in Class IX.

 The award could not have come at a better time. Her fisherman husband is yet to go back to the sea because of ill health.

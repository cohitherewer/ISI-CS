 Prez rule to stay: Buta

 Patna, May 2: A day after Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan constituted a seven-member team to explore the chances of forming a non-BJP, non-RJD government in Bihar, Governor Buta Singh today indicated that any such possibility was remote.

 The governor, instead, stressed the need to hone up the administration under central rule so that the ?good work? begun under the present dispensation gets a more concrete shape.

 The administration, meanwhile, replaced director-general of police Narayan Mishra with his counterpart in vigilance, Ashish Ranjan Sinha, and made Mishra managing director of the Bihar State Police Construction Corporation.

 Paswan had yesterday scotched the ?rumour? that dissent was brewing among his party?s 29 MLAS over the delay in government formation, especially because they hold the ?key? to installing a new regime in the state.

 ?My party is extremely democratic and the legislators freely speak their mind. We discussed the matter at length and there was unanimity in deciding not to align with the BJP or the RJD in any form. There is no change in our stand. But the new committee will explore all angles,? Paswan said.

 The seven-member LJP committee, constituted under party leader Ranjan Prasad Yadav, however, does not seem to have a clear job ahead of it. While clarifying that it will hold talks with ?like-minded secular parties? like the Congress, CPI, Samajwadi Party, CPM and others, Paswan said for any positive movement, the Janata Dal (United) will first have to break its ties with the BJP.

 The party continues with its stand on having a Muslim as chief minister. Sources said it could well have a senior Congress leader in mind for the post if the talks progressed in a positive direction. A similar exercise begun by JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar had to be abandoned after Paswan refused to have any truck with the NDA constituent.

 The LJP leader had yesterday called on the governor but Singh today described the meeting as ?private?. The governor said Paswan had raised the issue of payment of salary of the new MLAs who have not been able to take oath.

 The governor said the arithmetic of the legislators makes it highly unlikely that either of the major groups can cobble up the required 122 heads. Singh said there was an improvement in the law and order situation under President?s rule and added that the process of transfers and postings was on to provide impetus to effective administration.

 Official sources described Mishra?s removal as a step in this regard but the appointment of Sinha to the top police post, with additional charge of vigilance, has come as a surprise. ?Mishra?s policing potential was definitely left unproved during his tenure of several months. But, it is doubtful if Sinha, given his track record, will prove to be any better. What is certain is that it is hardly a routine shuffle,? a senior IPS officer said.

 ?The real test will lie in what the administration does with the Siwan district magistrate and superintendent of police. The speculation is that the no-nonsense officers, who have made a big difference in the district but rubbed the RJD the wrong way by taking on controversial MP Mohammad Shahabuddin, could soon be given the marching orders,? he added.

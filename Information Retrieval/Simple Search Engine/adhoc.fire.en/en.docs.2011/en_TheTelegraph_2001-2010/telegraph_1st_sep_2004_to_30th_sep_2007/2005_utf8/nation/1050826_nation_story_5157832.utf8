 Job tears run over Widows

 AMIT ROY

 London, Aug. 25: The latest insurance company to announce outsourcing of work to India is Scottish Widows, which today confirmed it is moving 125 jobs from its office in Edinburgh.

 The company is famous for its television advertisement which shows a beautiful woman wearing a black cloak. Unions representing staff said they would oppose compulsory redundancies.

 Todays announcement follows the success of the offshoring of 40 posts as part of a pilot operation in 2004.

 Scottish Widows, part of the Lloyds TSB Group, currently employs around 2,500 people in Scotland. 

 The transfer is understood to affect around 125 staff at its Dalkeith Road premises in Edinburgh. 

 A Scottish Widows spokesman said: There will be no redundancies as a result of this work and our aim is to minimise the impact on our people. However, there will be some internal reassignments and moves across our client services function in support of this work.

 The spokesman added: Any reduction in roles will be managed through natural turnover, the reduction in temporary agency employees and a decrease in overtime.

 Scottish Widows is committed to keeping all staff informed throughout and will continue talking to the unions at each stage in the process.

 He also made it clear that the jobs would be back office roles which would not involve customer contact work. 

 In the past, some customers in the UK have complained they cannot understand Indian accents. 

 Lloyds TSB Group Union (LTU), which represents around 45,000 Lloyds TSB and Scottish Widows staff in the UK, condemned the jobs move.

 Steve Tatlow, the unions assistant general secretary said: It is unacceptable that the work of staff in Edinburgh is being made redundant merely because they can be replaced by workers paid a fraction of the salary in India.

 He said: We will be seeking the fullest possible support from MPs, MSPs (members of the Scottish Parliament), councils and, most importantly, customers of Lloyds TSB and Scottish Widows in Scotland, in our efforts to stop the export of Scottish jobs to India. The bank should stop turning a deaf ear to its customers and understand that it has a responsibility to keep jobs in the UK economy where it makes almost all of its huge profits.

 He warned: Any organisation that so obviously ignores the wishes of its customers does so at its peril.

 The unions Scottish Widows representative Keith Sinclair said staff were shocked and concerned at the plans.

 There have been scare stories, suggesting that personal bank details and pin numbers are sold by unscrupulous staff in India.

 New Delhi, July 2: The court of Delhi metropolitan magistrate, V.K. Khanna, today remanded Amit Jogi in CBI custody till July 8. 

 The son of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi is charged with hatching the conspiracy to murder the states Nationalist Congress Party treasurer Ram Avtar Jaggi. Amit is lodged at the CBI headquarters.

 The bureau claimed in court it had concrete evidence against Amit on financing and masterminding an assault through his friend Surya Kant Patil. But it said it needed time to unearth the conspiracy behind the murder, to recover some weapons and investigate money transactions. 

 The CBI said it was Amit who had arranged the money and that he had full knowledge of the conspirators.

 Sources said Amit spoke out on certain things related to the murder when he was shown statements of co-accused, Bultu Pathak and Suresh Singh, during interrogation yesterday. 

 The CBI is expected to ask for Amits transit remand to produce him before a designated court in Raipur. But it plans to put him through a lie detector test first. The CBI had requested for 14 days custody, which the defence counsel opposed. 

 While being taken away, Amit said he would speak out at an appropriate time. Father Ajit Jogi claimed Amit has been falsely implicated.

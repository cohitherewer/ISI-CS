 Commandments to bring MPs on right path 

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, May 24: Ten were enough for God, looking to keep ordinary folk on the path of righteousness.

 Somnath Chatterjee, dealing with members of Parliament, needed more.

 The Parliament secretariat has accepted the Speakers 19 commandments that aim to make the study tours of parliamentary committees less wasteful, more transparent and productive.

 If the guidelines, issued on May 18, are followed strictly, these tours may cease to become pleasure trips paid for by the public.

 Chatterjee looks to curb the tendency of House committee and subcommittee members to pack their suitcases on the slightest of pretexts. Instead of travelling to, say, a particular state, the committee should ask officials from that state over to Delhi, the guidelines suggest.

 If a panel thinks a tour is absolutely necessary, its chairman should meet the Speaker and justify this. Only if the Speaker agrees, the tour is on.

 But more than a third of the committee cannot go. And no one goes on more than one study tour a year if Chatterjee can help it. Also, a tour will ordinarily not span more than five working days and never exceed 10.

 Chatterjee is strict about who can accompany members on a tour. Their children, relatives and friends cannot. Spouses, too, cannot ? ordinarily.

 If a member is ill, he may take along his wife (or she her husband) but must pay all her expenses, including hotel bills. If a members spouse is ill, then also he can take her along for treatment, but only with permission from the panels chairman, and foot the bill himself.

 In exceptional cases, some other person can accompany him with the chairmans permission. If permission isnt taken, the member may be debarred from further tours.

 The spouse or companion must not accompany the member during his visit to any installation, office or establishment as part of the study or during informal discussions with officers concerned. 

 On tour, the members must stay in government guesthouses, MLA hostels or circuit houses. If none can be found, a state-owned hotel will do.

 If even this is not available, a good hotel must be found. The arrangements shall be dignified but not ostentatious and should leave no room for criticism from the media and the public. On no account shall any member ask to be put up in a particular hotel.

 The members will travel in AC coaches or cars, with two sharing one car.

 None may accept gifts. Or invitations to lunch or dinner or offers of any other form of hospitality from any private party. And when they attend official lunches or dinners, drinking is a no-no. No extra trips on the side will be allowed at public expense during the study tours. No member, other than the chairman, should brief the media.

 Through it all, each member must maintain dignity and decorum so that no one finds any reason to criticise the committee in any way.

 The commandments were framed by Chatterjee three months ago in consultation with Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, L.K. Advani and Pranab Mukherjee.

 The Lok Sabha has 16 department-related standing committees and the Rajya Sabha eight. The committees have 30 members each.

 The MPs regularly go on tours to various parts of the country, citing committee work, and get some public sector undertaking to pay for the visits. Often, family and friends accompany them.

 Loss and guilt gnaw parents

 A tsunami victim cries in Kanyakumari. (Reuters) 

Nagapattinam, Jan. 4 (Reuters): She sobs uncontrollably, 

saying their names out loud. Devi. Janaki. Kamalam. Karathi.

 ?I gave birth to four daughters and I couldn?t even save one of them,? cries K. Vellangkani, a friend holding her tight as she shakes.

 It is every parent?s nightmare: Your children snatched from your arms and you are powerless to save them. As survivors of the tsunami pick up the pieces of their lives, many are torturing themselves with blame over their lost children.

 From fishing villages in south India to plush beach resorts in Thailand, the killer waves tore children literally from their parents? arms.

 As trauma teams prepare to help survivors cope with the mental wounds, parents are wracked with guilt. About their own survival. About the child that lived and the ones that died.

 ?If it?s a case of a mother having been forced to give up one child to save another, the stress will be tremendous,? said Linda Lam, a professor of psychiatry at Hong Kong?s Chinese University.

 Many people will develop what psychiatrists call Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, whose symptoms include nervousness, insomnia and excessive worrying.

 Sufferers also re-enact scenes of the catastrophe in their minds and avoid anything which reminds them of the disaster, such as going to the beach or watching television news. 

 People with severe disorders fall into depression, and up to 15 per cent could try suicide.

 ?The psychological trauma is very intense,? said Lo Wing-lok, a Hong Kong doctor with Oxfam who is helping survivors in India. 

 ?People are sitting outside their destroyed homes with nothing left, crying and weeping. It?s a picture of despair.?

 Psychiatrists say survivors of major disasters will suffer emotional turmoil and grief for months, even years. Those who need to return to making a living would be better able to cope.

 In Nagapattinam, Vellangkani, 37, was with her four daughters, when the tsunami wiped out her village. 

 ?I was holding all my daughters, but the water was too strong, it pushed them away from me,? she says. 

 ?I have lost all my daughters. I feel nothing now. There is nothing left inside.?

 In a refugee camp, other mothers are saying ?if only?. ?If only I was there with them, I know I could have saved them,? says M. Devi, whose six-year-old son, Prabakaran, and eight-year-old daughter, Karmathi, died. Only her 10-year-old daughter, Pragati, survived. 

 Devi was on the beach and her children were playing at a relative?s house when the waves struck. 

 ?I was sure somebody would save them. But they brought back only bodies. It is too much for me to bear.?

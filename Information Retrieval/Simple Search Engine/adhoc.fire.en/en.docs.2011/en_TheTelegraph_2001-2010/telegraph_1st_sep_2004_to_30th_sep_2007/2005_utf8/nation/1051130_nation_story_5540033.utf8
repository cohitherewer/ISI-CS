 Atal crack at Uma lust for power

 - Sack buzz gets louder as BJP bosses get set to wield the stick

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: If Uma Bharti had been hoping the BJPs top leadership ? Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh ? would still be sympathetic to her, she must have been disappointed today.

 Whatever happened was the height of indiscipline, Vajpayee said early this morning. Internal competition is a sign of healthy politics but when it transforms into lust for power and crosses all limits, it creates difficulties in future. 

 All matters are being considered. What happened was sad. Indiscipline will not be tolerated howsoever big the person is and whatever the issue may be.

 Both Vajpayee and Advani expressed confidence that Shivraj Singh Chauhan, whose ascent Uma is protesting, would complete his term.

 The four hijackers ? this is how Uma referred to Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu and Sanjay Joshi ? have clearly been able to bring the top leadership around.

 These second-rung leaders are the same that Uma had accused last year of conspiring against her and whom she humiliated, along with Advani, in front of television cameras. They seem to be having the last laugh.

 The BJPs parliamentary board is expected to meet tomorrow to decide Umas fate amid speculation that she will be axed. She has been served a showcause notice, along with 13 others. Six of her supporters, including former Union minister Prahlad Patel, have been suspended.

 The three central observers to Madhya Pradesh ? Jaitley, Mahajan and Rajnath Singh ? will submit their internal report to the BJP president tonight.

 From Jaitleys description of the situation, the report is set to nail Uma. This whole drama was enacted because she did not have the numbers with her. Most legislators were in favour of Shivraj Singh Chauhan. The final count was 154 versus 17 in favour of Shivraj, he said today, adding that the whip of discipline will be enforced.

 Interestingly, Jaitley, Mahajan, Venkaiah and Rajnath worked in tandem to force this outcome. Although Venkaiah was conspicuous by his absence in the last couple of days, Umas supporters burnt his effigy in Bhopal.

 The rest of the leaders had carefully planned the action in Bhopal. That she would never accept Shivraj Singh Chauhan as chief minister was no secret but Uma, inadvertently, let on her plan of action. 

 Even before the partys parliamentary board met on November 26, most second-rung leaders knew Uma would insist on a secret ballot to elect the legislature party leader. This was because she had insisted on a secret ballot in Bihar.

 Unlike many others, Uma harbours no personal grudges against Sushil Kumar Modi. But in party meetings, she insisted that he should not be foisted on the legislators and they should be allowed to choose their own leader.

 It was, therefore, expected that Uma would insist on a secret ballot in Madhya Pradesh. We were expecting that she will take 30-35 legislators along with her. But she has managed to get only 17 MLAs, said a senior leader.

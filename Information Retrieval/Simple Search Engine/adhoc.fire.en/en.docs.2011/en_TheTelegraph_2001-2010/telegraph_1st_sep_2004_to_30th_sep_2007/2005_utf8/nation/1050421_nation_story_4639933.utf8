 Cong high on SP meet agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 20: Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav today indicated that ?anti-Congressism? would form a significant part of deliberations during its three-day national convention beginning here tomorrow.

 The Uttar Pradesh chief minister, flanked by senior leaders, said his party did not approve of the UPA government?s role in the reopening of investigations against George Fernandes in the defence deal scandal after giving him a ?clean chit?.

 ?What is being done by the Congress-led government, especially the defence minister (Pranab Mukherjee), is wrong. We do not approve of such hounding. The Congress should refrain from such acts,? Mulayam Singh said.

 The Samajwadi Party government in the neighbouring state has come under constant attack from the Congress, especially party MP Rahul Gandhi. Party leaders said this attitude of the Congress would be discussed at length during the convention and could well be included as part of its political resolution.

 Mulayam Singh refused to assign any reason for selecting Patna as the venue for his party?s national convention. ?This was decided at our last national executive meeting. This will be our sixth convention and as a practice, we have been holding these at different places,? he said.

 But state leaders said the choice of venue was significant because the party wanted to widen its base in Bihar. The Samajwadi Party managed to win four seats in the Assembly elections.

 Mulayam Singh said he did not favour the continuation of President?s rule in Bihar and attempts should be made to form a secular government in the state. ?The mandate against the previous government should be respected. Any government in Bihar should not have the Congress, BJP and the Rashtriya Janata Dal as a constituent. Such a government is possible,? he added.

 Asked about his probable role in the formation of such a government, Mulayam Singh said his party would support any such initiative. ?Central rule will not continue in Bihar for long. We do not want fresh elections as well. We will welcome any effort at government formation provided the three players I named are kept out of it,? he added.

 The Samajwadi Party chief said he was all for reviving efforts to form a ?third front? as suggested by the CPM?s new general secretary, Prakash Karat. ?We have been talking about a non-Congress, non-BJP front for a long time. The process for the formation of such a front is definitely on. This issue can also be discussed at our convention,? he added.

 Mulayam Singh denied that there was any infighting in his party?s Bihar unit and underplayed the tussle between state party chief Dadan Pehalwan and senior leader Shankar Prasad Tekriwal, who has ?dissolved? the committee led by the Yadav leader.

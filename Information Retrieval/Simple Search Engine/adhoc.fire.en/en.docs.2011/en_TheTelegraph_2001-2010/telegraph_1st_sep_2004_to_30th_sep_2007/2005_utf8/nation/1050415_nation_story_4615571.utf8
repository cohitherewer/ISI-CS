 Axe on traffic-stopper gods

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, April 14: The gods would soon make way for mortals.

 The Congress government in Andhra Pradesh has decided to remove shrines that have been causing traffic snarls on the already overcrowded roads of the state capital. 

 The decision, which could trigger a backlash, was announced recently after a review meeting.

 ?I think the gods and goddesses have no place on the city?s crowded roads,? chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy was quoted by officials as having said at the meeting. ?They should make room for the citizens.?

 According to officials of the Hyderabad municipal corporation and the city?s urban development authority, there are over 11,200 small and big shrines that have come up along the city?s 250-km-long roads. 

 But if the gods are responsible for holding up traffic, men are to blame too. 

 ?More than the space occupied by temples, the fruit and flower vendors around them and the devotees who stop for a quick darshan cause more road accidents and traffic disorder,? says Tejdeep Kaur Menon, additional commissioner of police in charge of traffic.

 The gleaming infotech hub of Hyderabad has over 35 flyovers but traffic slows to a crawl during peak hours. 

 The problem has been exacerbated by slow-moving cycle-rickshaws and horse-driven tongas that ply the roads every day. 

 ?Nearly 35 per cent of the city still enjoys the slow mode of traffic like cycle-rickshaws and tongas which add to the congestion,? says a police official. 

 Harried commuters have to contend also with a dubious distinction that Hyderabad enjoys: the city has the highest number of two-wheelers ? 18 lakh ? in the country.

 Campaigners for a clean and traffic-jam-free city have come up with another suggestion. 

 They say statues of prominent political leaders should be at a distance from the main thoroughfares. 

 ?Political parties block roads on the birth or death anniversaries of their leaders and cause misery to the common man at least twice a year,? says Ved Kumar, who has been campaigning for a clean landscape.

 Although the municipal corporation had long ago decided to remove shrines from the middle of the city?s roads, political considerations and religious sentiments scuttled the plan.

 Pak walks Indus tightrope

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: Its tough public face notwithstanding, Pakistan is still undecided on seeking the World Bank?s intervention in resolving differences with India on the Baglihar project.

 A team of Pakistani technical experts was in India to hold discussions on the matter. While Pakistan water resources secretary Ashfaq Mehmood stressed that the talks had failed, his Indian counterpart V.K. Duggal insisted there is a possibility that the team will be back after a ?short recess?.

 The experts will submit a report to President Pervez Musharraf, who will then decide whether his government will go ahead with the threat of involving a World Bank-appointed ?neutral expert? or whether he should ask his team to come back here and negotiate for a settlement.

 Pakistan feels the construction of the Baglihar project on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir violates the Indus Water Treaty ? an umbrella agreement signed in 1960 on sharing of river waters between the two sides. It asked Delhi to stop work on the site. 

 India refused to comply, but recommended that the talks, which involve ?a number of complex issues?, continue. Delhi also suggested that the two sides resume discussions after a weeklong break and some common ground may be found. Duggal said if the neighbours are keen on ?promoting goodwill?, both will have to accommodate each other.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Boat with wings to fly

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 4: A catamaran fitted with aircraft wings capable of travelling at half the speed of wind could soon debut on Indian shores.

 The project is the brainchild of V. Radhakrishnan, the son of Nobel laureate C.V. Raman and professor emeritus of the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore where the model is being assembled.

 Radhakrishnan was in the city today to receive the MP Birla Memorial award for his contribution to astronomy, astrophysics and allied disciplines. 

 The double-hulled catamaran, a successful prototype of which was built in 2003, will be 15 metres long and eight metres wide with a 15-metre-high wing to enable smooth and fast sailing.

 The ocean-going catamaran, propelled by wing sail and controlled electronically, would have joysticks on its control panel and will be able to travel at half the speed of wind, said the 76-year-old scientist. 

 It will also have back-up solar sails to see it through less windy patches, he added.

 Radhakrishnan, however, refused comment on the commercial application of the catamaran, the building of which is being funded by the Defence Research Development Organisation and the Indian Space Research Organisation.

 I am building this machine because I love sailing, said the scientist, who is an expert in hang-gliding and micro-light flying. We also asked ourselves what can be achieved by using foils in place of sails and we used the answer in this catamaran project, he said.

 High-quality foils are non flexible and are able to retain their shape even under high wind pressure.

 Radhakrishnan said he was inspired by scientists who are passionate about sailing. Many people know Einstein for many things, but I worship him for his great interest in sailing.

 The award ceremony, held on the birthday of MP Birla, was chaired by R.S. Lodha, the chairman of the MP Birla Foundation. The Birla family, engaged in a bitter legal battle with Lodha, was represented by Nandini Nopany, the daughter of K.K Birla.

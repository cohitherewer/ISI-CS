 Foreign aid scanner on NGOs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 22: The home ministry, which is planning wide-ranging amendments in the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976, today said it would crack the whip on NGOs and other organisations that are using foreign aid for illegal and anti-national activities.

 Over 30,000 voluntary associations are registered under the FCRA and they get more than Rs 5,000 crore in foreign contribution annually.

 Although a large part of this money goes into various welfare programmes, the home ministry believes there are some unscrupulous elements who are involved in nefarious activities in the garb of welfare schemes.

 Our focus is to ensure that such associations which are engaged in illegal and anti-national activities are not allowed to function and flourish. We are gearing up to remodify the FCRA so that a tab could be kept on the utilisation of money, said additional secretary (border management) K.P. Singh.

 Singh was speaking at a news conference on a seminar on the FCRA, being jointly organised by the Union home ministry and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 

 The two-day seminar will begin on June 24.

 According to the home ministry, it has already initiated action against 11 NGOs while many more are under the scanner.

 The seminar will also focus on the Foreign Exchange Management Act and the Anti-Money Laundering Act that was recently passed by Parliament.

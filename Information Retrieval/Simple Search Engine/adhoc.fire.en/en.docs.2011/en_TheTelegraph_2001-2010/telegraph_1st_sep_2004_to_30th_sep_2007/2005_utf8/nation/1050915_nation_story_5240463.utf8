 Ministers in tug of war on village schemes

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The rural poor have never enjoyed so much attention with Union ministers desperate to try their hand at every pro-poor mega-scheme.

 At the centre of this fierce competition is the department responsible for improving the condition of the rural poor ? the ministry of rural development.

 Just as the ministry had thwarted efforts by panchayati raj minister Mani Shankar Aiyar to snatch as many as 13 of its rural projects, there is yet another move to whisk away the mother of all mega-projects ? the Bharat Nirman scheme.

 The contours of this conflict became visible when a group of ministers headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee began examining a proposal from the panchayati raj ministry for involvement in rural projects.

 The other members of the group were urban development minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Aiyar.

 Sources in the rural development ministry said the move was actually aimed at snatching 13 of the 14 important projects being implemented by the ministry.

 They wanted to take away everything ? the Sampurna Gram Rojgar Yojna, projects for supplying drinking water, sanitation, almost everything. The only project that we would have been left with was a scheme to computerise land records, said a source.

 The group of ministers, however, gave an ambiguous report that did not settle the turf war between the departments of rural development and panchayati raj.

 Raghuvansh Prasad claims that the first proposal of the rival ministry to whisk away 13 big projects has been rejected.

 There was a second demand to appoint more officials and streamline the ministry of panchayati raj. That has been referred to the finance ministry, he added.

 Yet another group of ministers has been set up to discuss the role and involvement of the panchayati raj ministry in a mega-project like Bharat Nirman, which has six main heads ? irrigation, rural roads, housing, drinking water, electrification and telephone connectivity.

 Aiyar is part of this group, headed by human resource development minister Arjun Singh.

 The other members are agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and social justice and empowerment minister Meira Kumar. 

 Dont get swayed by the language they use. The real purpose of this exercise is to ease into rural development projects, said a source.

 Despite the rural development ministers objections, the issue is far from settled. As the government announces mega-schemes by the dozen for the rural poor, such conflicts are likely to become even more bitter in the days to come.

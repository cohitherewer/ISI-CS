 Diet cancer: Delhi low-risk

 Hong Kong, July 18 (Reuters): A study spanning 14 cities across Asia has found the highest incidence of colorectal cancer among ethnic Chinese, a trend which researchers in Hong Kong today blamed on a more westernised diet.

 Between October 2004 and April 2005, doctors performed colonoscopies on 5,055 people and found polyps in 19.4 per cent of the subjects. Of these, 4 per cent had cancer.

 A further analysis found that colorectal polyps and cancers were found in over 18 per cent of ethnic Chinese, followed by just over 12 per cent of Indonesians, 12 per cent of Malaysians, 10 per cent of Thais and 8 per cent of Filipinos.

 Ethnic Indians were the healthiest in this regard, with only 5 per cent suffering the same condition.

 A leading researcher in the study blamed the phenomenon on the genetic makeup of ethnic Chinese and their changing diet.

 The prevalence of colorectal polyps and cancer among ethnic Chinese is very high, as high as in Caucasian populations, said Leung Wai-keung, professor at the Chinese Universitys Institute of Digestive Diseases.

 Our belief is that the Chinese genetic makeup is very susceptible to colorectal cancer but this race has been protected by traditional Chinese diet.

 But now, with lifestyle changes, a westernised diet, this genetic susceptibility has been brought out, he said, adding that diets rich in fat and red meat were the chief culprits.

 Asked about the growing popularity in Asia of weight-loss programmes from western nations which advocated diets that were low in carbohydrates and high in fat and meat, Leung said they would have to be followed over the long term to be harmful.

 The study covered the cities of Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Delhi, Jakarta, Fukuoka, Kitasato, Kurume, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Singapore, Taipei, Kaohsiung and Bangkok.

 Among ethnic Chinese examined in the survey, researchers found those in Hong Kong the most susceptible to advanced colorectal polyps and cancer ? 11 per cent of them were diagnosed with the condition.

 Eight per cent of Chinese in the southern city of Guangzhou were found with the illness, compared to 4 per cent of ethnic Chinese in Singapore and just over 2 per cent in Taiwan.

 The study also found that the incidence of colorectal problems was highest among people over 50 years old.

 If you are above 50, we would advise some kind of screening, Leung said.

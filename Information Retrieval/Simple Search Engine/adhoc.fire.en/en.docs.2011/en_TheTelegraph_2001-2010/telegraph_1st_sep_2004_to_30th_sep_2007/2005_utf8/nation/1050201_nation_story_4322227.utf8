 Tax amp; spend mantra for budget 

 - Left to ask govt to allocate additional Rs 50,000 crore to meet CMP promises

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 31: That the Left will want him to tax the rich more should come as no surprise to P. Chidambaram, but the bill they present him tomorrow could. Because Rs 50,000 crore is no small change.

 The high point of a wish list finalised at a meeting in the CPM office in Delhi is a demand for an additional Rs 50,000 crore to meet commitments made under the common minimum programme to stimulate agricultural growth, create rural jobs and spend more on education and health. (See chart)

 ?We want the government to allocate a minimum of Rs 50,000 crore in the Union budget for health, education and rural development,? said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan.

 It?s not often the Left parties get an opportunity to submit a budget wish list ? this year is an exception because they are an ally of the government.

 Along with a list of demands, they will offer the finance minister elaborate advice on how to raise the cash that may make Chidambaram flinch, though he would be familiar with the tax-more solution of the Left.

 It suggests reintroduction of capital gains tax and imposition of an ad valorem tax on foreign exchange outflow. If the stock market felt Chidambaram was liable to heed this advice, it could crash, as it had in the early days of this government when Left leaders made some market-unfriendly noises.

 A tax on foreign exchange outflow will affect foreign institutional investors that are the mainstay of the market.

 Protection to domestic players in power, petroleum and electronic goods through higher import duties also figure on the Left list.

 If domestic industry sees a champion in the Left for this reason, here is a warning: it also wants new corporation taxes and higher wealth tax. It suggests abolishing corporate tax exemptions.

 ?The budget should scrap the earlier tax exemptions given to corporate groups. Tax exemptions, however, should continue for the middle-level salaried classes,? said Bardhan, whose comments, combined with those of the CPM?s Sitaram Yechury, had spread panic in May 2004.

 A section in the Left recommends higher income-tax on those earning more than Rs 10 lakh a year. 

 Referring to low tax revenues, which stood at 9.21 per cent of the gross domestic product in 2003?04, the Left will argue that the tax to GDP ratio can be raised by around 1.5 per cent. ?The increased revenue mobilisation will be sufficient to meet the additional development expenditure,? a CPM source said. 

 The Left will urge the finance minister to stick to the common minimum programme while drawing up the budget. The leaders say that last year Chidambaram had presented an interim document but this time he would have a full budget to make a statement. Allocations for social sectors and employment generation schemes will have to be substantively higher.

 McDonalds pays $10m damages

 Silicon Valley (PTI): Fast food giant 

 McDonalds will pay $10 million to 24 groups, including 

 the International American Gita Society, as part of a settlement 

 of lawsuits.

 McDonalds has been charged with misleading Hindus and vegetarian consumers by wrongly describing its French fries, containing beef additive for flavouring, as vegetarian.

 McDonalds recently informed the Gita society that it is among the groups receiving the settlement money, the US-based non-profit organisations spokesperson, Ramananda Prasad, said.

 We are such a small organisation, and nobody supports us, the temples are busy with their own activities, Prasad, who founded the society in 1984, said.

 The society will get $50,000 from McDonalds. The money will be used for developing a website on the Gita, especially a Gita for children, Prasad said.

 A US court approved the 24 groups after a Seattle lawyer, Harish Bharti, filed a class lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception in its claims of cooking fries in 100 per cent vegetable oil.

 The maximum compensation of $1.4 million, or 14 per cent of the award, goes to Vegetarian Resource Group, followed by $1 million to the North American Vegetarian Society.

 Summons in bakery case

 New Delhi (PTI): A Supreme Court-appointed 

 committee, inquiring into the flip-flops of Best Bakery 

 key witness Zahira Sheikh, has summoned Chandrakant alias 

 Bittu Srivastava.

 The Congress corporator from Vadodara, along with BJP MLA Madhu Srivastava, had allegedly paid huge bribes to Zahira to change her statement.

 Chandrakant has been summoned to appear on May 26 before the high-powered committee headed by Supreme Court registrar-general B.M. Gupta, who is assisted by joint commissioner of police Kanwaljeet Deol, in the inquiry.

 A recent sting operation by a TV channel showed that the duo had paid lakhs to Zahira to retract her statement.

 The committee has already examined Zahira and also questioned social activist Teesta Seetalvad.

 The Supreme Court had last year quashed a Gujarat High Court order acquitting all 21 accused in the case and had ordered fresh trial in Mumbai instead of Ahmedabad. 

 Retired major arrested

 Chennai (PTI): A 71-year-old retired 

 army major was arrested after he shot at his neighbour in 

 a fit of anger at Virughambakkam, police said.

 The incident took place on Saturday night, when Manivannan was taking his dog for a walk. Major Mathew raised an objection and after a verbal duel, he whipped out his pistol and shot at Manivannan.

 Gangster killed

 Mumbai (PTI): Balu Dokre, an alleged 

 member of the Chhota Rajan gang, was shot dead in Malaysia 

 by suspected members of rival Chhota Shakeel group, on Saturday 

 night, police said. Dokre was wanted in the killing of Nepalese 

 MP Mirza Dilshad Beg, who had alleged links with Dawood 

 Ibrahim. 

 Rohtang pass

 Shimla (PTI): Rohtang pass, the gateway 

 to the Lahaul valley in Himachal Pradesh that was to be 

 opened by May 10, will now be opened by this month-end. 

 The pass could not be opened due to inclement weather. The 

 opening of the Manali-Leh Highway, the second highest road 

 in the world, will also be delayed due to snowfalls.

 Salman trial

 Mumbai (PTI): A local court is likely 

 to start trial against actor Salman Khan on May 26 in a 

 hit-and-run case. He has been charged with killing one person 

 and injuring four. It had rejected his plea for exemption 

 from appearance. A court had earlier framed 10 charges against 

 him.

 Five drown

 Srinagar, Uttaranchal (PTI): Five 

 persons drowned after the jeep in which they were travelling 

 skidded off the road and fell into the Alaknanda on Sunday, 

 police said. While four were missing, three persons were 

 injured.

 Car crash deaths

 Badwah (PTI): Six persons were killed 

 when the jeep in which they were travelling hit a tree on 

 Indore-Aidlabad Road on Saturday, Madhya Pradesh police 

 said. Seven persons were injured in the accident. 

 Pondicherry lieutenant governor M.M. Lakhera and chief minister N. Rangasamy joined others in pulling the chariot of Sri Tirukameswarar Temple in Villianoor at the Rath festival.

 Tricolour fiasco on Pak plane 

Jaipur, April 16 (PTI): A symbol of Indo-Pak 

friendship turned topsy-turvy.

 The Indian flag on the special Pakistan International Airlines plane, which brought Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf here, was displayed upside down ? green on top and saffron below.

 The aircraft had the tricolour on one side of its nose and the Pakistan flag on the other as it landed from Islamabad. 

 However, the mistake was detected soon after Musharraf and his wife Sehba left for Ajmer and was corrected.

 The Indian Air Force helicopter, which ferried Musharraf to Ajmer, also displayed flags of the two countries. 

 The PIA pilot, Wasimul Islam, said it was a ?human error and the moment we realised it, we corrected it.

 ?India?s flag will always fly high and its honour will remain intact.? 

 The BJP has demanded an apology from Musharraf for the display of the tricolour upside down.

 ?It appears to have been done inadvertently. Even then, it is a serious lapse. He (the Pakistan President) should apologise for it as it has hurt the sentiments of millions of patriotic Indians,? the BJP deputy leader in Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, said.

 Senior BJP leader Madan Lal Khurana, a former governor of Rajasthan, expressed concern over the issue. Khurana said the government of India should communicate its resentment to Pakistan.

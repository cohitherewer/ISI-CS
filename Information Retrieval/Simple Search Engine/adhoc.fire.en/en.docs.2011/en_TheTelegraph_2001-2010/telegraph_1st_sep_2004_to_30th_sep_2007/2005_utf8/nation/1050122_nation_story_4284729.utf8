 Night heist in temple

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 21: Gold and silver items worth Rs 8,000 were stolen from the 15th century Kapileswar Temple in the old town area of Bhubaneswar last night. The Lingaraj police station is a stone?s throw away from the temple.

 The items ? stolen from two smaller temples inside the premises ? included a silver crown, a necklace and gold jewellery of Lord Radhamadhava and silver ornaments of Goddess Dakshina Kali. The temple is a protected monument and is under the direct supervision of the Orissa government?s archaeology department.

 Bhubaneswar superintendent of police Amitav Thakur said the thieves broke into the temple after the rituals ended last night. ?Since the temple?s entry and exit gates are never locked, it was easy for the thieves to enter it,? he said. 

 The theft was first reported early this morning by one of the priests of the temple. Immediately after he entered the temple, the priest saw the locks of the two smaller temples broken. He immediately informed Giridhar Panda, trustee of the temple.

 Later, Panda lodged a complaint with Lingaraj police station. 

 Devotees were not allowed to enter the temple while police officials interrogated the priests and some local residents. The temple authorities suspended rituals for the day.

 Police were yet to arrest anyone till this evening. They did not rule out the involvement of insiders in the theft. SP Thakur said the temple has witnessed several such thefts in the past few years. 

 The road that leads to the temple has been encroached upon by some local people in violation of the state archaeology department?s guidelines. 

 Prior to this incident, the state had witnessed scores of temple thefts, the most notable being the one inside Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar in November 2002.

 Red war on ?starvation? deaths

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, March 9: The death of Ranjan Manjhi of Prabhat Nagar village in Jehanabad district has put the CPI(ML) on the warpath.

 ?Manjhi is the fifth person in recent months to die of starvation in the district. Shame on an administration, which allows starving people to die in the name of the model code of conduct. It can take on the mighty Naxalites but is not able to save the poor from dying,? said Ramadhar Singh, district president of the CPI(ML).

 Deputy development commissioner B. Mayank appreciated the party?s commitment to the cause of the poor but disagreed on what led to Manjhi?s death.

 ?He was extremely poor and unable to work due to a fall, which partially paralysed him. But prima facie, his is not a starvation death,? he said. 

 Mayank further argued, ?Sure, the party had briefed us on Manjhi and many others who suffered due to unemployment and poverty. The party even wanted us to organise programmes for them. But what could we do? The model code was in effect and the party had fielded two candidates from the district.? 

 Thirteen-year-old Apni Kumari, the daughter of the deceased, is the only surviving member of the Manjhi family. 

 Manjhi, who died on March 3 in his mid-sixties, was a tough man who could easily loosen the hard earth till about five years ago. But life took a decisive when he fell from the thatched roof of his house.

 ?He used to sell mud for years. When that was banned, he switched over to breaking stones on the hillside. That too was stopped in the pretext of ecology and tourism. In the meantime, the fall left Manjhi invalid and forced the little girl to wander around, collecting firewood and food,? narrated Wasi Ahmad, a CPI(ML) functionary in Jehanabad.

 About two months ago, the party brought the death of Jhapsi Manjhi, allegedly caused by starvation, into public focus. It submitted a list of people below poverty line, who were on the verge of death due to malnutrition, to the administration. 

 The CPI(ML) also demanded proper implementation of the food-for-work programme and relief for the incapacitated under Annapurna Yojana.

 ?We even met the DDC, who promised to look into the matter and take necessary steps. But nothing happened and the starving people began to die. I hold the district administration guilty for all the deaths,? party leader Mahanand said.

 DDC Mayank tried to explain the situation leading to the ?unfortunate? deaths and suggested that the local panchayat head could be responsible. ?Every panchayat is supposed to have a stock of 1 quintal of foodgrains for emergencies. I wonder if the mukhia knew about Manjhi?s case and did something to save him,? he said.

 The CPI(ML) on Monday called a Jehanabad bandh to protest the deaths. ?Now, we will start an agitation to force the administration to implement the schemes for the poor. We will also camp in front of the block development office. If anyone dies of starvation, we?ll leave the body at the BDO?s doorstep and protest,? Ahmad warned.

 Mayank said he hoped to launch the food-for-work scheme by March 10.

 600 turn victim to Andhra scorcher

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, May 18: A searing heatwave has killed 600 people in Andhra Pradesh this month, officials say, with the worst yet to come.

 The coal-mining town of Kothagudem has clocked the seasons highest of 51 degrees Celsius. Its 48 degrees in Telengana and Karimnagar and over 45 degrees in Nellore and Guntur. Last year, the mercury had stabilised at 47-48 degrees.

 Temperatures could rise by another four degrees, especially in the sweltering coasts, the director of the state weather office, G. Sudhakar Rao, has warned. He blamed the heatwave on the north-westerly winds sweeping the Indian peninsula.

 Schools, theatres, offices and shops look deserted during the day in Hyderabad, which has recorded a highest of 42 degrees, with attendance soaring only at Snow World, the countrys sole snow games enterprise.

 By midday, even the commercial districts look desolate, said Chaganmal Jaiswal, a travel executive.

 In the temple town of Tirupati, the heat sent at least 50 devotees to hospital. We are spraying water continuously on all the roads and at the prominent junctions to ease the misery of the thousands of devotees, a temple spokesperson said.

 Following the heatwave alert by the Indian meteorological department on May 12, the state government has directed all district collectors to stock up on fodder and drinking water.

 Southern coastal Andhra is already facing a water scarcity. Water cards are being issued and water is being rationed to each household. 

 The heatwave has intensified since May 12 with the mercury touching 45-plus at Vijayawada. The searing heat has hit the wedding season in coastal Andhra, said the local MP, L. Rajagopal.

 In the upland region of Mahboobnagar, Warangal, Karimnagar and Medak, the death toll is expected to be nearly 120, said a senior official in the department of disaster management in Hyderabad.

 Ironically, the heat has saved lives in Telengana. Maoists had planted a bomb at the police station in Jagtial, but the heatwave caused an explosion hours before the arrival of VVIPs, thereby causing no harm to anyone, a police officer said.

 In May-June 2003, over 3,000 people had died in a heatwave in the state, said the additional commissioner of disaster management, I.S. Sree Naresh.

 He said the heatwave committee formed on the basis of the recommendations of Parchauri, director of the Tata Energy Research Institute (Teri), had been functioning since then to identify the sensitive areas all over the country and take suitable steps.

May 17, 2003, had set a record for heat-related deaths 

in a single day: 158.

 Hang me

 New Delhi, Oct. 24 (PTI): Hang me from the Red Fort but spare my husband, wailed Rehmana Yousuf as the court convicted Ashfaq in the Red Fort attack case.

 Additional sessions judge .P. Saini had to stop reading the judgment several times due to Rehmanas outbursts as her police escort and lawyer tried to restrain her.

 Innocents are being hanged while the guilty ones go free only because they are Hindustani, she shouted, questioning the fairness of the order.

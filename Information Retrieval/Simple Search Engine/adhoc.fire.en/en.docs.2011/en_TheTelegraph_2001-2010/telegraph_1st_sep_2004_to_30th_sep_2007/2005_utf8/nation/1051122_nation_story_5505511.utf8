 Left open to non-navratna selloff 

Approval possible, case by case

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: The Left parties today formally agreed to consider government proposals to sell stake in profit-making non-navratna companies.

 We have identified some such PSUs and shared information with the Left parties. They have agreed to consider the proposals, finance minister P. Chidambaram said at the end of a two-hour meeting of the Left-United Progressive Alliance co-ordination committee.

 Left sources present at the meeting, however, claimed that CPM leaders have already broadly agreed to the governments proposal in private. But the Left would still go through the list the government is giving it and study each divestment plan in detail before officially agreeing to it.

 We may strike off some of these companies if we feel that they do not serve public interest, said co-ordination committee member Abani Roy of the RSP. He said the Left would ensure that the sum total of government investment didnt fall below 74 per cent in any of the companies.

 Chidambaram said the Left parties had agreed to consider the governments proposals to divest small portions of equity, subject to certain guiding principles, in selected profit-making non-navratna public sector enterprises in order to raise resources for the national investment fund. He said the Left would also suggest other ways of mobilising resources.

 Last week, Chidambaram had said the government was looking at selling small chunks of stake in non-navratna PSUs. 

 Among companies likely to be taken up for minority stake sale are Shipping Corporation of India, Engineers India, National Fertilisers, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers, Hudco, Balmer Lawrie and National Aluminium Company. Share sale in Maruti Udyog has already been cleared by both the cabinet and the Left.

 The government had earlier agreed, under pressure from its Left allies, to drop plans to sell stake in navratna companies. The navratnas or nine jewels are actually eight in number and include blue-chip firms like Bhel, ONGC, SAIL and NTPC.

 Chidambaram is believed to have assured the Left that no PSU from the key sectors ? energy, steel or mineral ? will be sold off. The government plans to sell stake in some 12 PSUs, of which six will be shortlisted for divestment this financial year.

 In the first phase, the Centre is expected to offer shares of listed PSUs. In the second, shares in unlisted PSUs will be brought to the market as IPOs.

 Top finance ministry officials said the government aimed to eventually list on bourses all currently unlisted, profitable PSUs, each with a net worth of more than Rs 200 crore, as well as to sell minority shareholding in listed profitable PSUs.

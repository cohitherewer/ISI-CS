 Garo alert

 Shillong, Oct. 1: An uneasy calm prevailed in the Garo hills today, as the funerals of the nine victims of yesterdays police firing were held in the curfew-bound towns of Tura and Williamnagar.

 There was no fresh report of violence from the area but BSF and CRPF personnel patrolled the streets and the army was on standby. However, people preferred to remain indoors. Residences of ministers in the Garo hills were given special protection, with the Garo Students Union demanding the resignation of all 24 MLAs from the Garo hills.

 Nine persons, mostly students, were killed when police opened fire on protesters at the Chandmari playground in Tura and at Rongrenggre in Williamnagar yesterday.

 Star shine to Pak spring

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Mahima, Shatrughan: 

 Star power 

 Lahore, Feb. 6: India found a presence in the Basant festivities that Pakistan observed today, despite the intermittent rain, in keeping with the spirit of the ongoing peace process.

 Shatrughan Sinha and Mahima Chowdhary were among many foreign guests who attended a colourful kite-flying festival here today to mark the advent of spring.

 The actor turned BJP leader, impressed by victorious shouts of ?bo kata?, drumbeats, songs and firecrackers, described the festivities as ?a fantastic event bringing colours to life?.

 Thousands of people perched on rooftops in Lahore?s walled city area, following last night?s music concerts and dinner parties.

 The skyline aglitter with colourful lights, the on-and-off shower and cloudy sky failed to dampen the spirits of the residents. Even Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf turned up for the occasion despite the restrictions on his movement after abortive assassination bids in the last two years.

 He was accompanied by his wife as well as Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. They spent a few hours in Lahore to celebrate with family and friends amid tight security.

 Public parks and rooftops of all tall buildings, shopping plazas and hotels were crowded with revellers marking the annual festival promoted by the Punjab province government since the mid-1990s.

 The zest for the festival, which started yesterday and will last till Thursday, matched that of Id.

 ?Such an action-packed Basant is not celebrated (anywhere else) in Asia. It is fantastic,? Sinha said.

 The actor-politician and Mahima were with many Lollywood artistes, including Meera and Resham, and government officers at a farmhouse on Badian Road for the festivities.

 Foreign diplomats were entertained at a musical show that the parks and horticultural authority arranged at the Asif Jah Haveli, named after Mughal queen Noorjehan?s brother.

 Officials said more than 50,000 people ? including many women ? from across Pakistan had arrived in Lahore for the occasion along with 10,000 other Pakistanis from West Asia, Europe and the US.

 Multinationals such as Unilever, Siemens and Nestle reserved the best roofs in the city and used the festival to promote themselves. 

 Many distributed free kites carrying the company insignia as part of publicity campaigns.

 Company executives were seen celebrating as also foreign tourists on rooftops of local hotels.

 The rush in areas designated for kite-flying was such that many guests who had received invitation cards were not allowed in for fear of overcrowding. Islamabad?s version of Basant festivities will follow later.

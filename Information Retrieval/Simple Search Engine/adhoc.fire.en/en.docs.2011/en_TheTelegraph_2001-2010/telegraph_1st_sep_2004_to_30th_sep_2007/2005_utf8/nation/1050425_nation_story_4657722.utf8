 What crisis? asks Sonal

 New Delhi, April 24: A day after theatre artiste K.N. Panicker resigned as vice-chairman of the Sangeet Natak Akademi protesting against chairperson Sonal Mansingh, the danseuse today said there was no crisis in the organisation and declared that she would not step down.

 ?What is the big crisis? We had a meeting all day yesterday in which we very animatedly discussed the calendar of events of the Akademi and finalised the budget allocation. I do not know what happened in three hours after the meeting for Mr Panicker to resign,? Mansingh said. 

 She met Union information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy this evening. ?We have placed concrete facts before the minister about the situation and it is now up to him to decide (the) course of action,? she said after the meeting that lasted about 40 minutes. 

 Panicker had put in his papers last night in protest against the ?unconstitutional, unethical functioning of the Akademi under her (Mansingh)? and also to express solidarity with Carnatic maestro Balamuralikrishna, who had earlier quit the executive board of the organisation.

 Mansingh said: ?A handful of people are vocal in criticising me but they were unable to give a single thread of evidence.? 

 Had she made any mistakes, she would not have hesitated to apologise, the danseuse added. ?The artistes, who are now speaking against me are the ones who had been enjoying advantages before my time. I stopped these practices,? she said, adding this was the main reason behind the vilification campaign against her.

 Dancer Raja Reddy, who is spearheading the campaign against Mansingh, said the resignation by the two noted artistes from the executive board had made it clear that the mandate was not in her (Mansingh?s) favour and ?she should now gracefully resign?.

 In Thiruvananthapuram, Panicker today said he had been kept in the dark on important developments in the Akademi, including the resignation of Balamuralikrishna from the executive board. 

 ?It is almost one month since he resigned. As vice-chairman, I should have been told. At least the executive should have been informed. I came to know about it from Jaipal Reddy?s office,? Panicker said.

 On alleged political leanings of Mansingh, he said: ?I did not say anything on that but some organisations in Delhi had reportedly made such complaints. Criticism is that she works for the BJP. I don?t know to which party she belongs. My feeling is that when a person occupies an important position, he or she cannot work for any political party.?

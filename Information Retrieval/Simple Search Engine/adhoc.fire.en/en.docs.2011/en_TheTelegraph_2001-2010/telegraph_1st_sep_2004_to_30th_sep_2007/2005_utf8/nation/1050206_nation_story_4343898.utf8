 New Delhi, Feb. 5: S.K. Srivastava thought he would escape the spotlight if he put in his papers.

 The weatherman, who has gone wrong with his monsoon predictions in the past, got this one wrong, too. Only this time, he ? and not the farmer ? is at the receiving end.

 The CBI arrested Srivastava, the former chief of the Indian Meteorological Department, after a raid at his residence threw up more questions than he was willing to answer last night. 

 Srivastava will now have to spend 10 days in the custody of CBI sleuths who are trying to ascertain where he has stashed away the money he is alleged to have made in procurement of sophisticated equipment needed for weather forecasts.

 The crackdown on Srivastava?s house as part of a nationwide drive against corruption revealed Rs 8 lakh deposited in a dozen bank accounts, a flat in Delhi and a posh house in suburban Gurgaon in the name of his woman assistant besides 12 credit cards.

 The CBI is investigating allegations that he has also stashed away money in Singapore, Canada and other countries. Besides accusations that he amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income, Srivastava has also been accused of misusing his official position by favouring a woman friend. The CBI has claimed in its FIR that his personal assistant, Mona Bajaj, was helping Srivastava fix ?deals? with companies dealing in meteorological equipment.

 Srivastava had first courted trouble last year when the wife of a colleague accused him of sexual exploitation. He was subsequently advised to proceed on leave after a recommendation to suspend him was rejected by the government. His arrest in this case was stayed till February 10 by Delhi High Court when he approached the court for anticipatory bail.

 The bureau is also probing 28 foreign trips Srivastava made between 1995 and 2004, a majority of which were to Geneva, where the International Meteorological Centre is located.

 The FIR alleged that Srivastava, during his tenure as IMD director-general, purchased equipment from MT Corporation, a company whose board of directors included his woman friend. Investigations revealed the company existed only on paper.

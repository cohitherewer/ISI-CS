 Dial the world, Rs 2 a minute

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: ISD calls can be now made at as low as Rs 2 a minute legally as against the existing Rs 16 per minute to the US and other countries.

 World Phone Internet Services has launched a scheme that will allow consumers to make calls to over 40 countries around the world for Rs 2 per minute.

 The customer under the companys World Phone Economy Plan can also get 500 talk minutes for a monthly subscription of Rs 995.

 Last month, the government had allowed the use of Voip (voice over Internet protocol) technology, legalising a procedure that was being tapped furtively by some because of the big difference in cost.

 Making an ISD call using the World Phone plan involves the following steps.

 Get an Internet connection from any Internet service provider

 Deposit Rs 4,000 (refundable) for a modem that would be supplied by World Phone

 Connect the landline phone at your home to the modem

 Dial the ISD code and the telephone number without dialling zero

 World Phone will take your Internet account details for security

 The Rs 995 will be debited to your account and would be reflected on a website. It can be viewed by both the customer and World Phone 

 Once the amount is spent, the account can be refilled by depositing a cheque with the dealer or at select branches of a private bank

 Under the economy plan, a subscriber can make ISD calls to the US, the UK, Canada, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Taiwan.

 Aditya Ahluwalia, the managing director of World Phone, said: We are trying to shrink the world and still keep it affordable for the consumers. 

 Targeted at home users and small and medium businesses, the plan is being offered by World Phones offices, channel partners and authorised resellers in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai. 

 The calls will be routed through the worldwide Internet backbone, using the companys high-speed data networks spread across the country. 

 Our economy plan, backed by our world-class technology backbone, will enable us to gain a strong foothold in these segments, added Ahluwalia. 

 The tariff plans and details can be accessed from the website www.worldphone.in.

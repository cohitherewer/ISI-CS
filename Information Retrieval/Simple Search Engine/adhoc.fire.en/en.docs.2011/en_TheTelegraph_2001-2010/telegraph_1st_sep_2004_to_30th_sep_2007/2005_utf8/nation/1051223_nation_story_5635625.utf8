 Notice to Centre on riot letters

 Ahmedabad (PTI): The Nanavati Commission has issued a notice to the Centre asking it to clarify its stand on the letters of the late President K.R. Narayanan to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee about deployment of troops during the Gujarat riots in 2002.

 The notice was issued on Thursday to the secretary of the ministry of personnel and public grievances and pension on an application filed by advocate Mukul Sinha.

 The notice is returnable by January 2.

 The Presidents office had refused to send the letters on the ground that they were part of official communication and could damage public interest. It had referred the matter to the central government for clarifications.

 But Sinha said the letters held vital information on the Gujarat riots and could throw light on whether there was any government inaction in dealing with the rioters.

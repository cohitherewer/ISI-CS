 Tiger park care upsets Singh

 Ranthambore (Rajasthan), May 23 (PTI): Describing the disappearance of tigers as a matter of national concern, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said all is not well with the way the national parks are being managed.

 The tiger is a part of our national heritage and all major steps need to be taken to preserve and protect them, Singh said at a meeting to take stock of the situation relating to the status of the animal in the country.

 All is not well with the way we are managing our national parks, he said at the meeting that was attended by Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje as well as 20 wildlife experts and officials. 

 Disappearance of tigers is a matter of national concern, the Prime Minister said. The coming generation will never forgive us if we do not take steps to protect the tiger, Singh said.

 Singh, who was given an assessment on the reasons for the fall in the tiger population, will tour the Ranthambore National Park tomorrow.

 Population pressure, growing tourism, shortage of forest guards and presence of ill-equipped and ill-trained guards were identified as some of the reasons.

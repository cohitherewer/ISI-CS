 Congress chants democracy

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi appeared to reflect the Congress response when he said today: Any sports body has the right to democratically elect its leader. Sharad Pawar is the democratically elected president of the BCCI and, therefore, I welcome it.

 In spite of all the talk that a majority of the Congress and Congress-inspired votes were cast in Pawars favour, the party has been outwardly neutral on an ally with whom it has, at best, a working relationship.

 Congress sources said that as in the BCCI election last year, which Pawar lost to Ranbir Singh Mahendra, this time, too, there was no diktat from the leadership on which way to vote. If Pawar won, it is largely because of his skills at building bridges and winning over friends and foes, a source said.

 Even if there was support at the BCCI for the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief, it will not necessarily be replicated in an electoral battle in Maharashtra, the sources said. 

 With the Shiv Sena in a shambles and the BJP embroiled in its own leadership battles from the top to the various state units, Congress and NCP sources said the 2006 panchayat elections will be fought between them and stressed there will be no alliance. 

 In a sense, these grassroots polls are the most important in Maharashtra and we have to test our respective strengths, a Congress leader from Vidarbha said.

 The anti-Pawar faction in the Congress is already out to pull the new feather out of the NCP chiefs cap. What does the BCCI victory prove? A leader who was aspiring to become the Prime Minister by challenging Sonia Gandhi has been reduced to pulling out all stops to win a cricket body election. It detracts from Pawars stature, said a senior Maharashtra Congressman.

 After the Congress-NCP alliance won the Maharashtra election and Pawar weathered a rough health patch, his effort to become the nucleus of a non-Congress grouping within the UPA did not go unnoticed. 

 Pawar reached out to Lalu Prasad and the DMK-led front, both allies in the ruling coalition at the Centre. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was an old friend. But following failure to strike a rapport with the Left ? he is supposed to be uncomfortable with its FDI stand ? the initiative came a cropper.

 If his Congress rivals were dismissive of Pawars win today, his partymen were basking in it. It proves our leader is the most capable man. Whether he is playing politics or contesting cricket board elections, he is a veteran in the game, Lok Sabha MP Jaysingrao Gaikwad Patil said.

 While Pawar has been called a cricket anadi (illiterate) by some detractors, he can claim close ties with the game. His father-in-law Sadashiv Ganpatrao Shinde was a Test player who made his debut at Lords and Vijay Hazare, the legendary batsman, a friend.

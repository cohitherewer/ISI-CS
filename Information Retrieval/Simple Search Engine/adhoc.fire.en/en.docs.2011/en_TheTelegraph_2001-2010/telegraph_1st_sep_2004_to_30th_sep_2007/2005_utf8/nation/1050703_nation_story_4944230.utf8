 Singh for fresh start with Pak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 2: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has spoken of a new relationship with Pakistan which would centre on economic cooperation and not allow outstanding bilateral problems to become stumbling blocks.

 Speaking to Indian Foreign Service probationers at his residence today, an official press release quoted Singh as saying: It is my honest hope that we can find a new relationship with Pakistan whereby, despite bilateral outstanding problems, we make cautious efforts to resolve them. But if all problems cannot be resolved in one go, that should not block the possibilities of economic cooperation.

 Singh was quoted as observing that so far Indo-Pak ties had proved to be a stumbling block in carrying forward the process of regional cooperation. It is our effort to persuade Pakistan that we cannot hold back this process which is underway in many parts of the world and other regions like (the) Asean, European Union and Latin America.

 Singh admitted that India had not succeeded in this endeavour so far but added that he had not given up hope. 

 I am not saying that I see light at the end of the tunnel. But we are working very hard, the Prime Minister said.

 Singh also stressed on national security and protecting Indias borders, both of which he said were imperative if India were to achieve its economic and social goals.

 Landslides hit Valley crops

 Srinagar (PTI): Over 5,000 houses and 

 131,000 tonnes of crops have been damaged in the Valley 

 where 209 people were killed in snowfall-triggered avalanches 

 recently.

 Nearly 50 per cent of oilseeds, pulses, vegetables and wheat sown on 102,000 hectares of land have been damaged, resulting in a loss of about 131,000 tonnes of crops.

 The horticulture sector, the mainstay of Jammu and Kashmir, has been affected to an extent of 40 per cent, with the almond crop being the worst hit, official sources said.

 Electricity supply to vital installations like hospitals, telephone exchanges and water supply schemes has been restored while roads to all major towns and district headquarters have been reopened.

 HC notice to medical council

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court on 

 Monday issued notices to the Medical Council of India (MCI), 

 Delhi University and the ministry of health and family welfare 

 on a petition challenging the council?s refusal to grant 

 registration for practice to a former bio-chemist of a government 

 hospital here.

 Justice Manmohan Sarin asked the respondents to file replies by April 19, the next date of hearing.

 Triloki Nath, who worked as a bio-chemist and senior bio-chemist in lNJP and G.B. Pant hospitals for 28 years, contended that the council?s refusal order on January 4 amounted to violation of his fundamental right to earn livelihood and live with dignity as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.

 Nath, a M Sc in medical bio-chemistry from Delhi University, submitted that the degree was equivalent to MD in medical bio-chemistry and both were recognised as medical qualifications under the MCI Act 1956 and the holders can practise bio-chemistry.

 Nath claimed that the medical council had informed him in March 2003 that M Sc in medical bio-chemistry from Delhi University was a recognised medical qualification and that he could practise in the field.

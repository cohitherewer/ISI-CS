 Coup brake on illegal trade

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: India has gained in at least one way from the palace coup in Nepal. Smuggling across the porous border has declined sharply.

 Officials in the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), which mans the Indian side of the 1,700-km border with Nepal, say smugglers are lying low due to tighter security on both sides, a move originally aimed at checking Maoists but which is also keeping the smugglers from daring to cross over. 

 The Royal Nepal Army has strengthened its presence near the border to stop the Maoists, a task previously handled by poorly-staffed, ill-equipped local police stations, till King Gyanendra imposed an emergency early this month.

 One reason for posting the RNA at the border was to give the force a free hand to deal with the Maoist rebels. With the palace clamping censorship on media and restricting movement of political activists, it is not clear how far the army has succeeded in this endeavour. But ?yes, trans-border smuggling has reduced... so has the movement of people,? SSB director-general Himanshu Kumar confirmed.

 There are more check-posts and operations on the other side of the border. And unlike the local police, the RNA is not known to be as tolerant with the smuggling of weapons, explosive and counterfeit currency, besides third-country manufactured consumer goods.

 India exports rice, pulses, vegetables, consumer goods like medicines, pressure cookers, stoves, washing powder, garments, sarees, and some machinery items like automobile parts to Nepal.

 In turn, Indian traders import spices, electronic goods, batteries, shoes and emergency lights. The Indo-Nepal border, in fact, is one of the entry points for Chinese goods that are common in Indian cities.

 Estimates by economists have put the level of informal trade between the two countries in the vicinity of $300 million annually, but the figure does not reflect the movement of smuggled gold, narcotics and arms. 

 A point made in the studies is that trans-border traders have always considered smuggling as practically risk-free, but not any more now.

 On this side of the border, the SSB cannot afford to spare more forces but has made up by intensifying patrolling. 

 On an average, there is a border post after every 12 km. The government has also deployed the Indo-Tibetan Border Police near Darjeeling, also to check the Maoists.

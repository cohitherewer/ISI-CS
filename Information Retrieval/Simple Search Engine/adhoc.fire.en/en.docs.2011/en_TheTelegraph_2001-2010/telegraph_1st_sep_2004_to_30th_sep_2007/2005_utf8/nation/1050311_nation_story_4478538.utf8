 New mandis in 2 yrs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 10: In its bid to stop the distress sale of paddy, the Orissa government will open mandis in all 314 blocks of the state in the next two years.

 Stating that the government is committed to protect the interests of farmers and stop the distress sale of paddy, food and consumer welfare minister Manmohan Samal yesterday told the Assembly that the regulated market committees (RMCs) will open the mandis. The government will procure paddy from farmers at the minimum support price (MSP), he added.

 There are 60 RMCs in the state, which have operations in 51 revenue subdivisions. The government has also instructed district collectors to open procurement centres of the Orissa State Civil Supplies Corporation.

 The Assembly witnessed noisy scenes with Congress members staging a walkout over the government?s alleged failure to prevent the distress sale. The issue came up during a discussion on the admissibility of an adjournment motion.

 The Congress MLAs alleged that there is a nexus between mill owners, state officials and the Food Corporation of India (FCI), who deprive farmers of the MSP.

 Samal dismissed the allegations but the Congress MLAs did not budge. 

 Deputy leader of the Congress legislature party, Narasingh Mishra, demanded that an all-party meeting be called to discuss the issue. He alleged that for the past four months, farmers in Bolangir have not received their dues worth Rs 2 crore. ?Will the government pay interest to the farmers for the delay?? Mishra asked.

 He said a state delegation should meet Union minister Sharad Pawar in Delhi with the demand that the FCI procure paddy from farmers in future.

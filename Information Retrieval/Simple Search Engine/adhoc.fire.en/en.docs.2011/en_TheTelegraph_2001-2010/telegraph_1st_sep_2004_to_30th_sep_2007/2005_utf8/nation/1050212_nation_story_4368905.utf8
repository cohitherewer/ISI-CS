 SC axe on 117 varsities

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: The Supreme Court today quashed the setting up of 117 universities under the Chhattisgarh Establishment of Universities Act and struck down the law itself as ?unconstitutional?.

 A three-judge bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices G.P. Mathur and P.K. Balasubramanyam ruled the law was ?null and void? and ?deemed not to have been effected?.

 Out of the 117 universities established during the Congress regime under Ajit Jogi, 90 were closed by the current BJP government. The establishment of the remaining 27 was also quashed by today?s Supreme Court judgment and the closure of the 90 was also upheld. 

 The apex bench dismissed the petitions of the 90 varsities, which had moved court against the closure order of the BJP government.

 The effect of the judgment is that a similar law by any state paving the way for mushrooming of private universities could be held null and void.

 The Supreme Court allowed an appeal by educationist and former UGC chairman Prof Yashpal and a few others, which challenged the law itself besides seeking a direction to quash the establishment of these universities.

 The court said all the private universities established in the state under the law would cease to exist. If any institution had been established by these universities, steps would be taken to affiliate them to existing varsities in the state.

 The judges said, ?keeping in view the interests of the students?, the institutions and departments under these universities could now be affiliated to already existing varsities.

 The Chhattisgarh government has assured that it would protect the academic interests of students. State higher education minister Ajay Chandrakar hinted that the government could bring a bill to continue the functioning of the private universities. ?This is one of the options the government is exploring,? he told The Telegraph.

 The BJP government mandated through an order that a university should have a minimum corpus fund of Rs 5 crore and 25 acres of land.

 Stephens row ends in patch-up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: St Stephens College principal Anil Wilson today withdrew his resignation in what appeared to be a tactical retreat by the Catholic church.

 Wilson had last week put in his papers alleging that Bishop Karam Masih, the chairman of the colleges supreme council, was pressuring him into an improper admission of a jewellers daughter.

 The supreme council was expected to take up the issue at a meeting on September 14, but the chairman and the principal patched up and issued a joint statement today.

 According to Wilson, the patch-up came after the bishop called him around 10.30 in the morning yesterday and requested that he would like to pray with him. 

 Wilsons allegation triggered a campaign that saw many teachers and students come out in defence of the principal. It did not go down well with the church. Rev. Valson Thampu, a member of the National Council for Minority Educational Institutions, criticised Wilson for trying to discredit the Christian community.

 Wilson, on the other hand, questioned the right of the church to interfere in the affairs of the college. 

 Todays joint statement said: The chairman of St Stephens College unequivocally affirms and upholds the moral and ethical domain of principal Dr Anil Wilson.

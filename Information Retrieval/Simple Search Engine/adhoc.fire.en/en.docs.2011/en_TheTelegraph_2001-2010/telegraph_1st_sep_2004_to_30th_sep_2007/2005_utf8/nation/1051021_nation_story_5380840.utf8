 Muslim CM notice to Paswan 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Election Commission has issued a notice to Ram Vilas Paswan for soliciting votes in the name of religion.

 The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader, who promised to make a Muslim the next Bihar chief minister, has been asked to reply by October 24.

 The notice followed complaints filed by former director-general of the Border Security Force Prakash Singh and a public interest litigant, Gaurav Kathuria. 

 The poll panel said Paswans campaign violated the provisions of the IPC as well as the model code of conduct. 

 In defence, the LJP chief said: Some people ask for votes in the name of a Hindu nation, some in the name of Rabri Devi or Nitish Kumar. What is wrong if I ask for votes in the name of Muslims?

 Re-arrest order

 The poll panel has directed the Bihar administration to immediately re-arrest RJD candidate from Jamui Vijay Prakash.

 Jamui superintendent of police Arvind Kumar said yesterday that Union minister Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav got his brother freed after he was arrested for breaking an electronic voting machine and moving around with weapons, cash and liquor. 

 There was trouble for Rabri Devi as well. The Vaishali district administration last night filed an FIR against the former chief minister and an RJD candidate for violating the model code during her campaign in Raghopur.

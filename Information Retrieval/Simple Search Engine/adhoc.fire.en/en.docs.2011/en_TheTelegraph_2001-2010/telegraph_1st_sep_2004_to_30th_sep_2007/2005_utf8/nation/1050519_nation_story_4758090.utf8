 Customs snaps up Russia circus duo

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, May 18: The customs department today arrested two directors of a city-based event management firm which was handling the account of the Russian circus that was destroyed in a blaze on April 4 in Mumbai. 

 The two directors ? Newa Prasad Yadav and Parimal Das ? were arrested today from their homes here.

 Of the five directors, two are absconding and one died under mysterious circumstances in Dimapur last month. All the directors are from Guwahati.

 Customs officials said Yadav and Das were arrested under Section 135 of the Customs Act for evasion of customs duty while importing sea lions, Eskimo dogs and mix- breed cats for the circus performances. Only three Eskimo dogs could be saved from the Mumbai blaze, but with severe burns. 

 The duo is also wanted by Mumbai police in the circus fire case. The chief judicial magistrates court this evening ordered a transit remand for both on the ground that their presence would help police crack the circus fire case.

 Siddhartha Bhattacharyya, the lawyer representing customs, said: The company had imported several endangered animals, including sea lions, which is a crime under the wildlife act. Moreover, the company was evading customs duty on animals and it is now liable to pay several lakhs? 

 Bhattacharyya said the death of the third director, Atif Ali, under mysterious circumstances has given the case a new twist. The presence of Yadav and Das in Mumbai might give clues to the police and help them hunt down the real culprits of the circus fire.

 Yadav and Das, however, said the customs department had whimsically arrested them despite their having resigned from the company before the circus fire.

 We had declared our disassociation from the company on March 4. Our declaration was accepted on March 23. The fire broke out on April 4. We were not absconding after the fire and co-operating with the authorities, one of them said.

 Yadav said he had given a 27-page statement to the customs department elaborating on the developments in the circus during his stay. Das gave a 16-page statement.

 Customs should look for Bani Das and Debang Kumar, the other two directors (who are absconding), they said, adding that they smelt something foul in the case.

 Police said Bani Das was with Atif in Dimapur when he died of stab wounds. They also said Atifs death could be a case of suicide. 

 Sources said customs officials have also spoken to Atifs widow, Yasmin Ali. The officials even checked Atifs bank balance.

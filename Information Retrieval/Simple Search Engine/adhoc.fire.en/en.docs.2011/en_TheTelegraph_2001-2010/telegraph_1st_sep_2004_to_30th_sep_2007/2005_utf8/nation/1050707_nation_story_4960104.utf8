 Parivar protest rift

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 6: Not even a terrorist strike on a temple they both want could bridge their differences.

 The rift between the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad over L.K. Advanis comments on Mohammed Ali Jinnah became clear at the protest rally the BJP chief addressed at Jantar Mantar today.

 The two organisations ? which belong to the same parivar ? decided to keep their protests separate at the same venue.

 That is, until the number of supporters who turned up fell short of expectations.

 The rally, which was to protest yesterdays attack on the makeshift Ram temple in Ayodhya, had BJP workers blaming VHP activists for breaking security barricades, which forced police to lob teargas shells and use water cannons.

 The BJP president, who addressed a crowd of about 2,000 demonstrators who grew restive under a steady drizzle, kept his speech short. After he left, other BJP leaders like Sushma Swaraj, Madan Lal Khurana, V.K. Malhotra and Sahib Singh Verma who took over and led the demonstration to court arrest at the Parliament Street police station.

 The VHP leaders who took part in the demonstration included Acharya Giriraj Kishore.

 BJP supporters began to gather at Jantar Mantar around 10 in the morning. But, by noon, it was clear neither the BJP nor the VHP would be able to gather enough supporters. Subsequently, the two rallies were merged. Later, other Sangh parivar activists joined the rally.

 Bajrang Dal and VHP activists decided to court arrest. They started marching towards the police station shouting slogans like Jai Shri Ram and overturning the security barricades. 

 The police, in turn, fired teargas shells and used water cannons to disperse the crowd, which had also begun throwing stones. Several police officers, including deputy commissioner, New Delhi district, Anita Roy, were hit by stones.

 The protesters, who wore saffron headbands, also burnt effigies of Union home minister Shivraj Patil and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. Some of the demonstrators were seen wielding tridents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Warrant out on Goswami

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, May 31: A special vigilance court today issued non-bailable arrest warrants against former Patna district magistrate Gautam Goswami and others accused in the flood relief scam.

 The IAS officers lawyer, however, said his client would move for bail in a couple of days.

 Sources said police teams will fan out to various places to trace Goswami. 

 Red-corner notices were issued to airports and sea ports yesterday to stop him from leaving the country.

 Goswamis counsel Tuhin Shankar, however, said the issuing of the non-bailable warrant has not made any material difference to the status of his clients case and so he would approach the special court for bail.

 He said by issuing the red-corner notices and by announcing a cash reward for tracing the officer the vigilance bureau had overreached the courts power with the intention of maligning his (Goswamis) reputation.

 Such actions are taken in extreme cases and with respect to persons who are a threat to the nation. My client is a respectable person who has achieved so much in so little time, the counsel said.

 Legal action threat for govt employees

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 12: Non-gazetted employees in Bihar face the threat of legal action for their decision to continue their strike even as the Election Commission?s deadline expired today.

 A day after the employees put up an impressive show of strength, the commission today once again reminded them to report for poll-related work by this evening and threatened to take action if they failed to comply with the order.

 But the employees, who have the backing of three associations, were not willing to budge even after the warning. ?Let the government arrest the 3 lakh employees who are on strike. If it dares to arrest only our leaders, it will prove fatal for the government,? said Rambali Prasad, convener of the Bihar Sarkari Ardhsarkari Sevakarmi Samyukth Morcha. 

 A delegation of the employees had yesterday submitted a memorandum to chief electoral officer K.C. Saha and briefed him on the ?unavoidable? circumstances which led to the strike. It also reminded him that the battle was between the government and the employees and did not involve the poll panel. 

 ?We are not against the elections but are forced to tread this path. The government has cheated us by entering into a series of agreements but not implementing any of them,? the delegation told Saha. 

 Saha is understood to have agreed to forward the case to the government and the Election Commission of India for prompt action. At the same time, he asked the employees to end the strike, which they refused to do. 

 The government had earlier arrested some leaders of Patna Municipal Corporation for allegedly violating the Essential Services Maintenance Act during their strike last year. 

 ?The same story may be repeated this time, but we are not going to be cowed down,? Prasad said.

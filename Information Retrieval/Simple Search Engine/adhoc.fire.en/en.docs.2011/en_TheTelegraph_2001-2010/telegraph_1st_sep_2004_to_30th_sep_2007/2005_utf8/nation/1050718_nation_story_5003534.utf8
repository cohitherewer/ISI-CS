 Milking test for mother

 - harassment: in panchayat and in rail station

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 17: A harassed tribal breastfed her son on a railway platform in broad daylight to prove to hundreds of onlookers that the five-day-old boy was her child. Doubts about motherhood cleared, the crowd vanished, leaving the 28-year-old looking at the train on which she was to leave the station.

 Dharmasoutu Archana of Kotya in Warangal district blissfully boarded the second-class compartment of the Golconda Express ? travelling from Vijayawada to Hyderabad ? at Garla station at 9.30 am yesterday with her son on her shoulders.

 But the sight of a woman in a cheap white cotton sari carrying a glowing baby roused the suspicion of passengers in a state that has been rocked by adoption rackets.

 Fatima, a co-passenger quizzed Archana about the baby and the tribals halting replies led to more queries. When and where did you deliver the child? asked one traveller. Who is the father? Why is he not with you? Are you travelling with a proper ticket? Why are you going to Ahmedabad? the questions poured out.

 Some checked the cloth bag Archana was carrying to find two saris and a box with cooked rice and a vegetable dish. One passenger asked her why she was scared. Another even asked if she was a lanja munda (prostitute).

 Finally, one of them alerted the railway police over a cellphone about the child lifter in their midst and was told officials would take charge at Warangal. 

 I dont know what you people are saying but I will not keep quiet if anyone touches my baby!Archana screamed. 

 At Warangal, co-passengers escorted Archana to the police post, where an hour of questioning left officials doubting if she was a child lifter.

 A passenger suggested that Archana breastfeed the baby. If the baby does not accept your milk, you will be sent to jail, an official threatened, leaving the tribal with no choice but feed her child in front of a gaping multitude.

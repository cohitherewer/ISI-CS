 Bangla arrests

 Mumbai, June 21: Sixty-three illegal immigrants from Bangladesh were arrested today when Thane rural police swooped on a slum at Mira Road here, reports our correspondent.

 The police said most of them ? 44 men, six women and 13 children ? were migrant workers. A metropolitan court has remanded them in judicial custody until the deportation paperwork is over. 

 The police routinely arrest illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and deport them. An estimated one lakh such nationals ? men work as labourers and women as domestic helps ? are believed to be in Mumbai.

 Young Bangladeshi girls have been found to be involved in the flesh trade.

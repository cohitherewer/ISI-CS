 Naidu roars after rebuff

 Hyderabad, May 30: Chandrababu Naidu today followed up his election as Telugu Desam Party president for the sixth term with a challenge to the Left and the BJP to try and isolate his party.

 TDP is ready to fight any election on its own as it does not survive on the mercies of any political force, he said on the last day of the Desam convention.

 The strong words were spurred by the Left parties refusal to join hands with him in his campaign for an integrated Andhra Pradesh and the BJP rebuffing his proposal to fight the civic elections jointly.

 If it comes to that, we will go to these polls alone, the political resolution endorsed today said, having little to show in terms of electoral alliances.

 Naidu stood firm that there should be no Telengana state. The TDP has always stood for an integrated Andhra Pradesh as the only solution for development of backward regions in Telengana, he said.

 Targeting his favourite whipping boy Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, he claimed the chief minister had ended reforms in the state. We launched the second stage of reforms. Now the Congress is switching off the process in the name of populism.

 Other leaders too gunned for the Reddy regime, blaming it for the murder of democracy and poor law and order.

 On Reddys peace talks with the Naxalites, former home minister T. Devender Gowd said: The futile exercise of talks have further intensified Maoist violence. Never has there been any mass murder of civilians by Maoists as recently.

 Gowd pointed a finger at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, saying she had not honoured her pre-poll promise of providing relief to families of 90 farmers who committed suicide. She forgot about them after coming to power, he alleged.

 Yerran Naidu said instead of the United Progressive Alliance, it was Sonia and her coterie who were running the government.

 Naidu is now in the select club of regional party chiefs ? Desams NTR, Shiv Senas Bal Thackeray, DMKs M. Karunanidhi and ADMKs Jayalalithaa ? who have headed their outfits for over a decade.

 Hundreds greeted him after his election with swords, bows and arrows as also copies of the Bhagwad Gita, Bible and the Quran. Actor Roja, who lost the 2004 Assembly polls from Nagari, called him a star among stars.

 Former Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslameen legislator Ibrahim bin al-Musqati, who had given the Desam an edge over the Congress in the Hyderabad municipal polls, hailed him as Allah ka karam (a creation of Allah).

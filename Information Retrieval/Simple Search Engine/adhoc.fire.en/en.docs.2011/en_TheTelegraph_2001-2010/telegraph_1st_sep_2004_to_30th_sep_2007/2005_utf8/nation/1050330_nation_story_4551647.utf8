 Thackeray PA ducks homicide charge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 29: Mumbai police today added two more sections to the hit-and-run case against Ravindra Mhatre, the personal assistant to Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, a day after blood tests revealed he was drunk.

 However, they are yet to apply Section 304 Part II, charging him with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

 Mhatre had been arrested on charges of rash and negligent driving when his car crushed four pedestrians, killing two of them, on Saturday.

 But he was released on bail as the police did not file a case under Section 304 Part II, which would have invited 10 years? imprisonment.

 Salman Khan, who had mowed down five pavement-dwellers in Bandra in 2002, had been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

 Deputy commissioner of police Bipin Kumar Singh said: ?We have added section 66B of the Bombay Prohibition Act and Section 185 of the Motor Vehicle Act. We have not applied Section 304 Part II yet.?

 Mhatre?s blood test report showed an alcohol level of 0.9 mg. The permissible limit is 0.5 mg.

 Relatives of the accident victims have threatened to take legal recourse over Mumbai police?s handling the investigations. They have accused the police of trying to cover up the matter. 

 Initially, no information was available on whether the mandatory breath analysis and a blood test had been conducted on Mhatre. 

 The police later clarified they were done in Bombay Hospital.

 Questions were also raised about Mhatre, who suffered minor injuries, being rushed to the hospital, while the two women who were in a more critical condition were taken to a municipal hospital, 7 km away, where they died.

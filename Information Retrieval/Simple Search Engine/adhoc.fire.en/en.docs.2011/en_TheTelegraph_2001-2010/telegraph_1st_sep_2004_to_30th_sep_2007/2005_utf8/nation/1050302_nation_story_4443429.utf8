 Patna, March 1: Patna High Court today dashed the ?hopes? of newly-elected legislators keen to occupy government quarters before receiving the house allotment order from the Assembly.

 ?No one should claim access to or occupy any flat till he or she gets the legal allotment order. If one dares to forcibly occupy any flat, he/she would be forcibly evicted,? the division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai ruled.

 The court was hearing a petition filed by the Patna Citizens? Forum on the forcible occupation of government quarters by MLAs.

 ?Soon after the previous Assembly elections in 2000, many MLAs had tried to forcibly occupy government quarters, leading to scuffles and chaos. The rationale behind the court?s ruling was to pre-empt such a situation this time,? petitioner for the forum, Mahendra Prasad Gupta, said.

 The court also directed the Patna administration to evacuate all encroachers and illegal occupants of government property and report to it after a week.

 Gupta, who was arguing for the Indian Medical Association?s petition on deteriorating law and order, said encroachment of public property continues to be a menace in the capital. ?It creates serious law and order problems and makes life hell for the public,? he said.

 The court will hear the case again on March 9 on the expiry of the deadline for the administration to take action against the offenders.

 The court also gave its verdict in the controversy over the alleged use of loudspeakers at a local mosque on February 4. 

 The mosque has been banned from using loudspeakers during court hours, it ruled today.

 The high court had also summoned some journalists ? from both the print and electronic media ? on charges of ?misreporting?. The court let the reporters go after they tendered apologies.

 Justice R.S. Garg had issued a notice to the police administration on February 4 after the mosque authorities used loudspeakers for the Friday prayers. Kothwali police rushed to the mosque and took the muazzin into custody and released him only after public demonstrations were held on Bailey Road.

 A section of the agitated mob had raised slogans against Justice Garg, which had offended him. He was later transferred to Gujarat.

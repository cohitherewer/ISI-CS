 India, Saudi Haj deal

 Jeddah, May 17 (PTI): India and Saudi Arabia today entered into an agreement for Haj 2006 that provides for an increase of pilgrims by private tour operators up to 10,000 and retains this years number of 82,000 for those being sent under the aegis of the Haj committee.

 The agreement was signed here by Saudi Haj minister Sheikh Fuad Abdul Salam al Farsi and visiting minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed. The number of Hajis sent by private tour operators will be increased, if necessary, from this years 45,000 to 55,000, Ahmed said.

 Saudi Arabia has also increased the space for each Haji from 3 to 3.5 square metres, which puts an obligation on India to find more accommodation for the pilgrims.

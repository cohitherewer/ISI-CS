 Again, crack of the whip

 KAY BENEDICT

 Somnath: Stern hand

 New Delhi, March 15: Subbirami Reddy of the Congress has asked a record 400-odd questions in the Rajya Sabha in a year, say Parliament sources.

 Such a volley may no longer be permitted as Speaker Somnath Chatterjee has decided to weed out frivolous queries in the House and not follow serial order when calling out questions listed for the day.

 A day after he said that every Tuesday he would announce in the House the number of hours and the money wasted because of disruptions, Chatterjee has turned his attention to question hour and zero hour.

 In his bid to discipline errant members, the Speaker today said that from next week he would call out at random anyone whose question is listed for that day.

 On a given day, 20 queries are selected for the question hour through a ballot draw. During the one-hour period from 11 am to noon, not more than four questions are taken up and the ministers concerned are asked to reply.

 Zero hour begins after noon when issues of urgent public concern and of recent occurrence are taken up. Ministers are not obliged to answer during this session.

 Often, members whose questions are listed are absent as also the ministers who are supposed to reply.

 Most members and ministers whose questions are listed beyond the first four or five in serial order do not come to the House or leave after the first few, thinking that their turn will not come.

 The Speaker today said he would no longer follow the serial order. The idea is to ensure that all members who have asked questions are present and the ministers concerned come ready with answers.

 Chatterjee has often pulled up the UPA government for the absence of its ministers when questions relating to their departments are taken up.

 The targets are also MPs who connive with some table officers to get their queries ? even if trivial ? listed for question hour and for special mention during zero hour.

 Reddy asked 75 questions between April-May 2002, 99 out of his list of 105 in July-August 2002, 106 out of 115 between November 2002 and February 2003, and 159 out of 175 in February-May 2003.

 The Speaker has told the table officers not to disclose the serial order to MPs.

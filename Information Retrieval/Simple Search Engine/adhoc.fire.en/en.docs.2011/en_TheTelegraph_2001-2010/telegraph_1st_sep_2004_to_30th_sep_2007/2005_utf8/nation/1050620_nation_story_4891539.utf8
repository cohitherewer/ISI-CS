 Sudarshan blasts Nehru

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 19: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief K. S. Sudarshan today gave L.K. Advani a breather and trained his guns on Jawaharlal Nehru, calling him the root of all troubles India now faces.

 Sudarshan told a crowd of mainly Sangh cadres that had turned up at Lakshmanmela Ghat this morning to observe his birthday, that Nehru had been foisted as Prime Minister on the country by the British.

 He was a nominee of the colonial British Raj. A British Viceroy had introduced Nehru to a crowd as the future Prime Minister long before he actually became that.

 Sudarshan, however, saluted Indira Gandhi as one of the few iron-willed Prime Ministers the country has had, referring to her role in splitting Pakistan in 1971.

 He made a brief reference to Jinnah, saying the British had put him up to demanding Pakistan, but spared Advani. But his regret that the countrys leaders lacked will seemed an oblique swipe at Advani and Vajpayee.

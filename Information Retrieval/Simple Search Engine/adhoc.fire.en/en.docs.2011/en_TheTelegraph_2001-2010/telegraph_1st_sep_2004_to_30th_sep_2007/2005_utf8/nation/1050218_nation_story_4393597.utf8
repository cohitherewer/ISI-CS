 Amnesty raises Nepal alarm

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: King Gyanendra?s royal coup in Nepal and the imposition of a state of emergency in the country are leading to a ?human rights catastrophe?, global rights watchdog Amnesty International said in a report released here today.

 An Amnesty team led by its secretary-general Irene Zubaida Khan toured Nepal from February 10 to 16 after the coup of February 1. Khan met the king, the army chief, political workers, social activists, students, trade unionists and journalists to prepare the report.

 ?Wherever we went, we encountered a deep sense of fear, uncertainty and insecurity among the people,? she said.

 ?The longstanding conflict between the Maoists and the armed forces has destroyed human rights in the countryside. Now, the state of emergency is destroying human rights in the urban areas, taking the country to the brink of disaster.?

 At her meeting with the king, Khan conveyed concern on the human rights situation. The king told her that emergency was a temporary measure but did not specify a length of time. The king had assured her ?of his commitment to uphold human rights and Nepal?s international obligations?. 

 But Khan told him that ?he would be judged by what he did and not by what he said?.

 ?The human rights crisis in Nepal did not start on February 1 with the declaration of emergency. It is an ongoing cycle, which is being aggravated and complicated by the state of emergency,? she said.

 Amnesty has also called on the international community to suspend military aid to Nepal. However, the organisation wants development aid to continue. 

 ?As major allies of Nepal and key providers of military aid, the US, the UK and India play a critical role. They have been outspoken about the restoration of democracy. They need to give equal importance to ensuring the Nepalese government guarantees respect for human rights,? Khan said.

 Censor Board 18 taste govt scissors 

 - Chop-and-change season returns to the capital

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The government today sacked 18 members of the 21-strong censor board and replaced them with its favourites. Actor Sharmila Tagore had earlier taken over as chairperson of the board, in place of the BJP-appointed Anupam Kher. 

 The earlier board packed with loyalists of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government could not complete its three-year term. 

 Information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy had been under pressure from the allies of the United Progressive Alliance government to sweep out vestiges of the earlier NDA government from his ministry. Though Reddy wasn?t keen to wield the broom, fierce criticism from the Left as well as Congress insiders forced him to act. 

 He began by throwing out the new crop of top executives appointed in DD News. Next came the turn of Kher, who has moved court not because his tenure has been cut short but because CPM leader Harkishen Singh Surjeet named him as one of the persons appointed by the NDA who had RSS links. 

 The information and broadcasting minister has not only overhauled the censor board but also appointed fresh faces in the Chennai and Hyderabad advisory panels. ?More are to follow,? a senior ministry official said when asked whether heads would roll in the seven remaining advisory panels. 

 Only three of the last government?s appointees remained on the Central Board of Film Certification ? Sanjeev Goenka, the Calcutta-based industrialist of the RPG group, Mrinal Pande, editor of Hindustan, and L. Suresh, a well known film-maker from the south. 

 The new members are all close to the powers that be. Membership of the censor board is generally a form of patronage handed over to people with proximity to the ruling party, but care has to be taken so that it also has proper regional representation. 

 Among the new faces will be Anees Durrani of the Congress? media cell who worked with Reddy at the AICC headquarters. Durrani is also a member of the Delhi Haj panel. 

 Shravan Shroff, a 34-year-old MBA from Melbourne Business School and scion of a family that is into film distribution, is also part of the board. Shravan is building multiplexes in Mumbai and Pune. 

 Among the other members, Mrunalini D. Patel is a film producer, Himanshu Joshi a theatre personality, P.S. Bhaktavatsalam a major producer from the south and also a member of the region?s film chamber of commerce. Sanjeev Bhargava is an impresario and connected with films.

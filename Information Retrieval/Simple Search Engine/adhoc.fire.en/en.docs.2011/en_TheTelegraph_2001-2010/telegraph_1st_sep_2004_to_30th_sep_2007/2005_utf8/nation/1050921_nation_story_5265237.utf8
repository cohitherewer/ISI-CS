The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Gaur scratches Naths back, Nath Gaurs

 - Get 

 clearance, give plane 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 (Top) Babulal Gaur, 

 Kamal Nath: Bhai bhai?

 Bhopal, Sept. 20: After cross-border camaraderie, it is time for home-grown bonhomie.

 The peace process with Pakistan seems to be affecting internal politics, too. 

 In an unprecedented gesture, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur offered a state-owned B-200 Kingair aircraft to Union commerce minister Kamal Nath to attend the G-20 ministerial conference at the hill resort of Murree near Islamabad on September 9 and 10.

 The Congress leader is returning the gesture by accompanying the BJP chief minister to Chicago to address foreign investors at the Focus India conclave on September 27 and 28.

 Informed sources told The Telegraph that Indian ambassador to the US Ronen Sen had opposed Gaurs visit on the ground that the meet did not require the presence of a chief minister. But Nath obliged Gaur by getting the necessary clearance from the Union government.

 Yes, we did offer him the aircraft, .P. Rawat, the principal secretary to the chief minister, said about Gaurs gesture. There was nothing wrong in it as our plane had requisite permission from the host country.

 Rawat said Nath might have preferred travelling by the state plane instead of one run by private operators that require more stringent clearances. Asked about the expenses, Rawat said it would be settled between the Centre and the state as per the norms.

 Nath was not available for comment, but his close aide R.K. Mighlani said: We did it to save time. The minister was busy with the EU summit and there was no direct flight to Islamabad. This aircraft took just an hour-and-a-half from Delhi so we opted for it. There is no politics in it.

 The state-owned aircraft, at the disposal of the chief minister, is supposed to function within the state and fly out during emergencies. But in recent years, many chief ministers have made it a habit to travel by state-owned aircraft to attend official and even private functions. A former Madhya Pradesh chief secretary said there was no law to prevent the aircraft from travelling outside the country, though there has been no such precedence.

 The ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh, however, remained unconvinced. Senior leaders avoided going public, but former chief minister Uma Bharti is reported to have brought the matter to the notice of Mohan Bhagwat and other top RSS functionaries. 

 There was uneasiness in the Congress, too. But Jamuna Devi, the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, curtly said: No comments. A few months ago, Devi had criticised Gaur for letting his daughter-in-law use the state plane to go to Bangalore.

 Speaking off the record, a former state chief minister said: What can one say? It was an offer that the minister availed.

 But Nath need not feel guilty. Gaur has also lavished praise on the Prime Minister, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and, besides Nath, four central ministers for funds of over Rs 20,000 crore to the state.

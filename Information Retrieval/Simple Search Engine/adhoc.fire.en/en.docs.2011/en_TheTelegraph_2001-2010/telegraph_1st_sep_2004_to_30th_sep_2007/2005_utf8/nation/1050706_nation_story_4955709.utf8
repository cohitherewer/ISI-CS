 Rane wins Round I

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 5: In the tussle between the Shiv Sena and its newest rebel Narayan Rane, the latter has won Round I. 

 The Vidhan Bhavan was the hub of activity today, with both Rane and arch rival Subhash Desai meeting Maharashtra Speaker Balasaheb Kupekar separately.

 On Monday, Rane, as leader of the Opposition, had appointed his loyalist Vinayak Nimhan the chief whip on the grounds that the Senas present chief whip, Gajanan Kirtikar, was unwell after a bypass surgery.

 But Desai contested Ranes authority to appoint Nimhan. The publisher of the Sena mouthpiece, Saamna, met Kupekar and gave him three letters, two of which were from Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray. 

 The first letter affirmed that the Sena had formally expelled Rane and sacked him from the post of the leader of Opposition. 

 The second said Kirtikar continued to remain the chief whip. The third letter was from Kirtikar himself, informing the Speaker that he was in good health to continue his duties as the chief whip. 

 Kupekar, however, upheld Ranes move to appoint the chief whip, a decision that is sure to irk the Sena.

 Rane, when he emerged from the Speakers office in the afternoon, announced a meeting of all Sena MLAs on Friday. We have sent letters to all MLAs inviting them for the meeting, he said. 

 The meeting would be a show of strength between party executive president Uddhav Thackeray and Ranes loyalists. To pre-empt a switchover of MLAs to the Rane camp, Uddhav loyalists have also called a meeting of Sena legislators on Wednesday.

 Thackeray also had to do some fire-fighting on Tuesday to prevent Rane from dislodging the party as the majority constituent in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

 Though in majority, several Sena corporators hail from Ranes base of Sindhudurg. Some of them declared open support for Rane on Monday after which Thackeray called an emergency meeting to prevent a defection.

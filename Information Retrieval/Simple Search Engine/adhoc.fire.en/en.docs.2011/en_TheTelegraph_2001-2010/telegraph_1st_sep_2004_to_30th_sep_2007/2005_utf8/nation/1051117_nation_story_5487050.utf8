Srinagar, Nov. 16: Another link was added in the chain of terror that began with Delhis pre-Diwali blasts as a car bomb today exploded on a busy but high-security road outside a bank, killing four people.

 The car blew up near the corporate headquarters of Jammu and Kashmir Bank Ltd in the heart of Srinagar late in the morning, making it the third militant strike in the state in as many days.

 The apparent target was a former junior minister, Usman Majid, who is the MLA from Bandipora in north Kashmir. His bullet-proof Ambassador was passing by when the bomb went off but he escaped with facial burns.

 Two civilians were killed on the spot. The bank guard, who was critically wounded, died soon after at Soura Medical Institute. Another died on way to hospital. Nearly 54 people were injured.

 The deafening blast ? some believe RDX was used ? was heard throughout the city. Our house shook and my daughter got scared, Habibullah Lone, who lives two miles away, said.

 The road, covered with fallen chinar leaves, was littered with damaged vehicles, mangled steel with blood stains on them, footwear and pools of blood, witnesses said.

 I was working when suddenly there was a deafening sound and everything shook. My women colleagues started crying, Ishfaq Ahmed, a bank employee, said.

 Since the blasts in Delhi in the run-up to Diwali, militants have been striking with alarming regularity. Yesterday, they targeted a PDP rally. The day before, grenades were lobbed at a CRPF bunker in Lal Chowk, triggering a 36-hour gun battle.

 A car bomb had exploded the day Ghulam Nabi Azad took charge as chief minister in early November, sounding an ominous note.

 Police today said the militants parked the explosives-laden car at the blast site minutes before it blew up. The All India Radio and Doordarshan offices are close to the bank.

 The huge glass exterior of the bank was shattered. There was absolute chaos inside, with hundreds of employees having reported for work.

 I was parking my car in the bank complex when there was an ear-shattering explosion. I saw huge sheets of glass falling from the building, Tajamul, a bank official, said.

 Panicky people ran helter-skelter on Maulana Azad road and the adjacent Residency road as vehicles stood bumper-to-bumper. Police had trouble clearing the area of traffic to allow ambulances to carry the injured to hospital.

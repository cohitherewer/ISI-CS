 Citu eyes IT, cites Karat

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Oct. 15: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants to keep the burgeoning information technology sector free of impediments. But M.K. Pandhe, Citu president and CPM politburo member, claims his party is with him in his move to form trade unions in the IT sector.

 Pandhe cited the latest issue of Peoples Democracy ? the CPM mouthpiece ? which carries the full text of his letter to Union labour secretary K.M. Sahni highlighting the violation of labour laws in the IT sector and the need to address them.

 Peoples Democracy has carried my letter in full. This shows the CPM is with me, Pandhe said. How can the IT sector be treated differently from other sectors? The entire Citu is with me on this demand. Our plans of unionising the IT sector will get concrete shape at Citus two-day all India working committee meeting on December 28 and 29.

 Pandhe said that since unit-based unions are difficult to organise in the IT sector, Citu may consider a national-level federation.

 The Bengal chief minister, however, assured IT heads after the Left-sponsored general strike on September 29 that the companies would not have to face such disruption of work in the future.

 But Pandhe held up CPM general secretary Prakash Karats front-page article in the same issue of Peoples Democracy as proof that the CPM brass is on his side.

 Prakash Karat has fully defended the strike, the Citu boss stressed.

 Karats article lampoons the media for its vituperative attack on the CPM and the Left following the September 29 strike. 

 No amount of vilification will deter the CPM from standing firmly with the working class and other sections of the working people in their struggle for a better life, Karat wrote. The working people will rebuff all attempts to put restrictions on the right to strike.

 Bhattacharjee has flashed a different signal to Citu and his party workers in Bengal, making it clear they have no right to prevent people from going to work. 

 The bandh seemed to have embarrassed the chief minister at a time when he was going all out to woo private and foreign investors. He was particularly displeased with Citu for disrupting work in the IT sector.

 But the Citu president said: Karats article reflects the clout we have in the party.

 As proof of the support he enjoys within Citu, Pandhe cited the letter the Bengal unit of the organisation has written to the state labour secretary, underlining the violation of labour rights. 

 Citu cannot differentiate between Bengal and the other states, Pandhe said.

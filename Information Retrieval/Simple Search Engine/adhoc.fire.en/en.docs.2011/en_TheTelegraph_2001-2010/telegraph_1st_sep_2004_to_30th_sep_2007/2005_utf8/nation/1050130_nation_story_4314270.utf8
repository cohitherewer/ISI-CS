 Police eye on kidnap suspect 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 29: Police today claimed a breakthrough in the Kislay kidnap case after taking six persons into custody.

 ?Chunnu Thakur, a notorious criminal lodged in Hajipur jail, is understood to be the key conspirator behind the abduction,? senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan said.

 Sleuths picked up Thakur?s wife Kiran, along with their three-year-old daughter Sumiran, last night and brought her to Patna for questioning. ?Her statements have helped us nab some others from Motihari and Bettiah,? a police source said.

 This morning, north Bihar police brought the mother and sister of Thakur?s key man Pappu alias Vicky to Patna from Motihari. ?We are interrogating them all and results will follow soon,? Khan said. The police have also sealed the north Bihar-Uttar Pradesh border.

 Kislay, a Class IX student of Patna?s Delhi Public School who was abducted on January 19, is believed to be held somewhere in the border areas.

 The police are also trying to secure Chunnu?s remand. A criminal in the Vaishali-Muzaffarpur-Darbhanga area, Chunnu is an accused in over 20 cases including murder, extortion, abduction and trading in arms. 

 Sources said he figures among the state?s top professional killers. He is also accused of having links with Maoists in Jharkhand.

 Khan denied the charge that the police have taken Sumiran into custody and said the three-year-old is under the protection of a non-government organisation and is with her mother.

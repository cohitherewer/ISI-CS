 Cong returns Dandi salvo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 14: The Congress today lambasted L.K. Advani for his comments on Saturday?s Dandi march and for lauding Narendra Modi as the best chief minister and Gujarat as the best-administered state.

 Accusing the BJP president of writing a ?new moral value code? in the country, Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma reminded him that the Supreme Court had to intervene to ensure justice for the victims of Gujarat?s ?shameful carnage? in the wake of a systematic subversion of law.

 Taking digs at both Advani and Modi, Sharma said the apex court had repeatedly indicted the Gujarat government and was even forced to transfer the post-Godhra riot cases outside the state.

 He added that the BJP leaders were asleep when thousands of citizens were denied protection while the organisers of the riots were safe. 

 Accusing the Modi government of ?deliberate default and connivance?, Sharma said Advani, who was home minister, did not take any action while then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had gone on record saying he was prevented from doing his ?raj dharma?.

 Countering Advani?s statement that the Dandi march was a ?purely Congress affair? and was meant for the ?exclusive projection? of party president Sonia Gandhi, Sharma expressed surprise at the BJP?s sudden interest in Mahatma Gandhi. 

 He said the party has been opposing all that Gandhi stood for. ?We are unable to comprehend Advani?s complaint. We are surprised and it appears strange that persons who share a doctrine that was responsible for the assassination of Gandhi? should want to be part of an event that commemorates the 75th anniversary of his salt satyagraha. Sharma added.

 However, the Congress spokesperson said, there is no restriction on anybody joining the march. Several Gandhians and non-Congress persons were part of the walk that started from Sabarmati, which falls under Advani?s Lok Sabha constituency, Sharma said. 

 ?Advani is an MP from there. Nobody stopped him from going. He is politicising and trivialising the issue,? the Congress leader added.

 Time hero in flood scam FIR

 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 Patna, May 28: A first information report was filed today against former Patna district magistrate Gautam Goswami, Time magazines young Asian hero and prime accused in a flood relief scam, and 27 others.

 The Bihar state vigilance investigation bureau, which filed the FIR, then carried out intensive raids across the Bihar capital and detained at least six accused. They include former Bihar Small Scale Industries Corporation managing director Bhuvaneshwar Prasad and two additional district magistrates.

 No senior government official accused in the scam has, however, been arrested. 

 The FIR charges Goswami and the others with committing fraud and forgery and siphoning off government funds by entering into criminal conspiracy with the owners of some fake firms, said Neelmani, additional director-general of the bureau.

 Goswami, hailed by Time for his work in reaching help to flood victims in Bihar last year, resigned from the IAS in February and joined the Sahara Group in Lucknow. 

 The state government, however, has not accepted his resignation and is likely to take action against him for joining another service accepting the resignation.

 On investigation, all the accused have been prima facie found to be involved in swindling government funds worth several crores of rupees meant for relief, Neelmani said.

 Official documents show that the state relief department had allotted Rs 13.48 crore to Goswami, then Patna district magistrate and the nodal officer for 25 flood-hit districts, for flood relief. 

 An additional Rs 5 crore was collected by allegedly diverting the funds allocated by the railways and the state welfare department.

 Goswami claimed to have paid Rs 17.18 crore to Bihar Small Scale Industries Corporation (BSSIC), the sole organisation in charge of supplying relief material.

 In early April, the corporation said it had supplied materials worth only Rs 22 lakh and had been paid only Rs 13 lakh, and that the rest of the money had gone to a corporation official, B.K. Singh. The corporation later confirmed that Singh was not its employee.

 Goswami, on the other hand, said all the payments had been made in the name of the corporation at the advice of its managing director.

 But it was found that the money was paid into the account of Baba Satya Sai Industries (BSSI) instead of BSSIC. BSSI was, officially, not involved in relief distribution.

 According to an official report, a truck that had left for Khagaria laden with polythene rolls on July 22 delivered 4.2 tonnes of dry wood instead.

 Another truck, supposedly carrying 4,000 kg of roasted gram flour to Samastipur, delivered plastic sheets weighing 1.9 tonnes.

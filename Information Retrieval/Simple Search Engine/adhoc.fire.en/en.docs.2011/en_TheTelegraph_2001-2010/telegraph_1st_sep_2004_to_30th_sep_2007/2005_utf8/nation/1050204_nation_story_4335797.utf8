 Jab at Dhaka in Saarc retreat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: India?s decision to stay away from the Saarc summit appears to be a deliberate attempt to send a strong signal to Dhaka about Delhi?s ?dissatisfaction? with the state of bilateral relations.

 India had cited deteriorating law and order in Bangladesh and the ?political turmoil? in Nepal as the reasons for its withdrawal from the summit scheduled in Dhaka. It has since been postponed.

 Foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna today rejected Bangladesh?s charge that the decision owed to developments in Delhi?s relations with some South Asian neighbours.

 ?Let me clarify,? Sarna said. ?We have not sought postponement due to any developments in bilateral relations with Saarc countries. We have drawn attention to developments that have an impact on the entire region of South Asia and not just India.?

 He cited the strong statements the heads of missions of the European Union and US assistant secretary of state Christina Rocca had issued in the past few days on the violence directed against political leaders in Bangladesh and deteriorating law and order.

 Sources, however, said the Indian establishment ? frustrated with Dhaka?s failure to enter into any ?constructive dialogue? with Delhi over the past few years ? took the opportunity of the Nepal royal coup to indeed send out a signal to Dhaka.

 Bangladesh foreign minister Morshed Khan had yesterday expressed ?shock and dismay? at Delhi?s decision. But Morshed?s anger, the sources said, was directed more at India?s move to cite his country?s deteriorating law and order.

 The Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led coalition government?s keenness to host the summit in Dhaka had more to do with proving some domestic points than pushing for regional cooperation.

 Dhaka was aware that the opposition Awami League was bent on focusing the world?s attention on the ?total breakdown in law and order? in the wake of attacks against the party.

 By claiming to provide adequate security for the visiting dignitaries, Dhaka was trying to tell the neighbours as well as the Awami League that there were not many takers for the Opposition?s claim.

 Saibaba staff face rape slur

 - Foreign visitors in abuse turmoil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 1: A German devotee has accused the personal staff of Sathya Saibaba of raping her repeatedly since she arrived at Puttaparthi in July.

 Besler Karia, 32, filed a police complaint on Monday that the staff had lured her into a room at Prashanti Nilayam Ashram assuring the divine presence of Saibaba and assaulted her.

 The police dismissed the charges. She is mentally deranged and a drug addict, said deputy superintendent of police A.S. Krishnamurthy. However, we have registered a case and sent the victim to Anantpur general hospital for tests.

 This is the second complaint of rape filed by a foreigner at Puttaparthi. A 38-year-old Ethiopian, Zenneth, had filed a police complaint in March accusing the staff of raping her. She, too, was sent to the Anantpur hospital and later given an air ticket back home. 

 Puttaparthi police have been accused of being close to the ashram. Saibaba, who is reputed to have assets worth Rs 5,000 crore, counts former Prime Ministers among his devotees. 

 In Andhra Pradesh alone, the Sathya Sai Trust owns property worth Rs 1,500 crore.

 Although allegations of sexual abuse of devotees and fraud have surfaced from time to time ? BBC did an expose last year ? no probe has been conducted so far. 

 The western and English media is always against the godman, says trust secretary S.S. Chakravarthi.

 But Saibaba has the residents of Puttaparthi ? his village that is now a small town of 25,000 which boasts a free super-speciality hospital and two five-star hotels ? and Anantpur district on his side. 

 He won the loyalty of the poor by providing for a Rs 300-crore drinking water facility connecting more than 450 villages in the district. 

 Saibaba has offered funds to replicate the experiment in chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys home district Kadapa, where more than 390 of 540 villages do not have safe drinking water.

 Neglected frontier finds a voice

 Imphal, June 13: Have you heard of Kargil? Surely yes. Have you heard of Molcham? In all likelihood, no.

 One of many villages that dot a long stretch of the Indo-Myanmar border in Chandel district of Manipur, Molcham is far from Imphal and farther from the minds of policy-makers in New Delhi, which perhaps explains its obscurity. 

 But Molchams is no ordinary story, and a young Manipuri theatre director has taken it upon himself to tell it like it is.

 Spanning a canvas that stretches from Molcham to Kargil, director Sarungbam Beerens Who are we? (Eikhoi kanano?) is a political play that lambasts Delhis obsession with Kashmir and its alleged ignorance of similar hotspots.

 The 75-minute play is based on the everyday struggle of the residents of Molcham, which has a population of just about 500. It narrates how troops from across the border routinely enter Indian territory to plunder, torture and molest.

 The play is scheduled to have a commercial opening later this month. Its premiere, held in front of a select audience in Imphal yesterday, created ripples. It is significant that four army officers were in the gathering.

 Who are we? will also be staged in the capital next month under the aegis of the National Institute of Performing Arts, and that is the show Beeren is looking forward to the most.

 There is no Indian or state force at Molcham or any of the nearby areas. Not a single VIP from either Delhi or Imphal has ever visited this border village. India is spending crores of rupees and sacrificing lives in defending Kashmir, but out there at Molcham, unarmed and simple villagers are left to defend themselves against brutish Myanmarese forces, Beeren said.

 The director primarily tries to trace the roots of the all-pervasive sense of alienation among youths across the northeastern states. He points out that despite not being provided protection from Myanmarese forces, residents of Molcham are still proud Indian citizens. 

 Who are we? is the result of an extensive study by the director on the state of affairs in the frontier villages of Manipur, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh and Myanmarese settlements along the international border. 

 Beeren even found the signboard of a government primary school at Molcham written in the Myanmarese script. Villagers said this was done at the behest of troops from the neighbouring country.

 The concluding scene of his play depicts a group of Indian soldiers finally landing at Molcham. The villagers are happy, thinking that their saviours have finally arrived. But it transpires that the soldiers have only brought the body of a Kargil martyr to his mother, for whom it is the second blow after losing her husband in an attack by Myanmarese forces.

 You are proud of Kargil heroes. But what will you do for my husband, who made a similar sacrifice in defending Indias border in this extreme corner of the Northeast? the grieving woman asks.

 Beerens postscript is equally hard-hitting. Delhis inability to treat all citizens equally gives rise to the flame of hatred, distrust and also encourages youths of the region to nurture the concept of separatism. This raises the big question ? who are we and where do we stand?

 The play has been produced under the banner of the four-year-old Manipuri Theatre Academy.

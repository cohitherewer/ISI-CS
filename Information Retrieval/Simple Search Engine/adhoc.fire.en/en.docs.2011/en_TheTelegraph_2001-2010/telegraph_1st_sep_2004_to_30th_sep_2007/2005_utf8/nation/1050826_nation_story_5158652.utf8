 Board loads gun on parallel dispute

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board is set to contest the charge, made by a public interest litigation filed in the Supreme Court, that it is operating a parallel judicial system to implement the Shariat.

 Board members are furious with law minister Hans Raj Bhardwaj for echoing the accusation at a news conference.

 The boards legal experts will meet on August 27 to decide on a response. Their main line of argument before the Supreme Court will be that Shariat courts (dar-ul-qaza) do not form a parallel judicial system for they are a totally voluntary set-up formed in accordance with the Constitution. 

 On August 16, the apex court had taken note of the PIL, which alleged that a parallel Muslim judicial system had struck root in the country. The court had issued notices to the Centre, the Dar-ul-Uloom (seminary) of Deoband, the personal law board and several states where Shariat courts apparently exist.

 A practising apex court advocate had filed the PIL, seeking to restrain these courts from adjudicating in civil and criminal disputes involving Muslims on the ground that a religious judiciary could not perform a sovereign function in a democracy.

 The law minister had later said: The Constitution recognises only one judiciary headed by the Chief Justice of India and nothing else. The Constitution does not recognise any of these Islamic courts. There is no question of allowing any parallel judicial system.

 Zafaryab Jilani, a Lucknow-based lawyer and a member of the boards legal cell, today hit out at the minister. A suggestion has been made? (that) we dont follow the Constitution, he said.

 The functioning of the dar-ul-qaza is complementary to the existing legal framework. It is an alternative disputes redress system just like the bijli adalat, the lok adalat, the family courts, etc. We are lessening the burden of the courts by letting people amicably settle their squabbles.

 One can understand somebody ignorant of such a practice bothering the Supreme Court. But a person of the law ministers standing should not display such ignorance. What does this statement mean ? that the Muslims exist outside the Indian Constitution? It is a dangerous allegation.

 Others share Jilanis concern. Its a fantastic notion that the Shariat courts function as a parallel judicial system, said board member and legal expert Syed Shahabuddin.

 Its a voluntary set-up. People go there voluntarily and they are free to reject the decisions of these (Shariat) courts. Their decisions are not binding. The first question that is asked when anyone approaches these courts is, have you approached any other court? No dar-ul-qaza has ever asked for recognition. I dont understand what the fuss is all about.

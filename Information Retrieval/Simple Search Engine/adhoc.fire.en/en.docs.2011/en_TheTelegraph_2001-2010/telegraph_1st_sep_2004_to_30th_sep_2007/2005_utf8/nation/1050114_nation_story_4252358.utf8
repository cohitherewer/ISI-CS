 Poll use whiff in licence haul

 A STAFF REPORTER

Guwahati, Jan. 13: The arms licences, issued 

by the Nagaland government and seized from a Bihar-bound passenger on the Brahmaputra 

Mail, has raised suspicions that those could be used for procuring weapons during 

the Assembly elections in that state next month. 

 Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel seized 45 arms licences from Harishankar Singh, a resident of Bihar, who had boarded the train at Guwahati railway station. 

 ?The licences were found in Singh?s suitcase during a surprise check on Tuesday afternoon,? superintendent of Government Railway Police (GRP), Jiban Chandra Koch, told The Telegraph today.

 A ban has been in force on issuance of arms licences for nearly 10 years in Nagaland, official sources said from Kohima this evening. Most of the licences were issued from Mon district and the rest from Wokha and Tuengsang districts of Nagaland.

 Singh, in his early forties, is from Sarbu Singh Kotola village under Brahara police station in Aarah district of Bihar. He has been booked under Section 468/420, IPC, and a case registered against him at the GRP police station. Singh has been remanded in four days? police custody after being produced in court yesterday.

 ?From preliminary investigation we suspect that the licences may have been used to procure arms for the Bihar elections,? Koch said.

 A police officer associated with the investigations said Singh was frequently changing his statements during interrogation. ?Though the licences look genuine, we will have to confirm with the Nagaland government as those could turn out to be fake,? the officer said.

 He said Singh has confessed that he had earlier procured arms licences from Nagaland for residents of Bihar and West Bengal. ?He told us that he sent those licences to the applicants through courier,? the officer said. 

 ?We are investigating why people from Bihar needed licences from Nagaland,? a GRP official said. ?We have strong reasons to suspect that some officials of the Nagaland government may also be involved in the racket,? he added.

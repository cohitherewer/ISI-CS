The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Shocked counsel to hit back

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 29: After weaving a web of confusion around the Best Bakery case, key witness Zahira Sheikh finds herself on trial.

 Her counsel Atul Mistry, however, feels Zahira has absolutely no reason to fear, though he is shocked by the Supreme Court-appointed probe committees charge that she accepted inducements from BJP leaders to lie in court.

 I was not really expecting such a report, Mistry said. We will file our objections.

 BJP MLA Madhu Srivastava, named as one of the politicians who induced Zahira to change her statements, however, is nervous ? though he claims he hardly knows the young woman.

 As soon as a part of the committees findings was read out in court, Srivastava quickly called reporters to the Vadodara circuit house to debunk the one-sided report. The committee, headed by Supreme Court registrar general B.M. Gupta, has named a few other BJP leaders, too, but the court today didnt reveal their names.

 I do not consider it an impartial report because Gupta has given a clean chit to Teesta Setalvad (a social activist whom Zahira has accused of extracting statements from her through trickery and blackmail), Srivastava said.

 It is clear that the Supreme Court registrar is in league with Setalvad. He has tried to clear her name. Gupta had come with a prejudiced mind to grill me.

 After the Gujarat fast-track court acquitted all the 21 accused in the Best Bakery case, Zahira had told the media in Mumbai that she had lied in court because Srivastava had threatened her. She later retracted her statement in Vadodara, accusing Setlavad of holding her captive and coercing her to name innocent people.

 Zahira is now living a secluded life. She stays in the middle-class locality of Bhailal Park, Makarpura, with her mother and younger brother. Jan Adhikar Samiti, a local NGO run by Vishwa Hindu Parishad activist Tushar Vyas, pays the rent and her bills. Her elder brother Nafitullah has returned to Best Bakery.

 When contacted, Vyas refused to talk about his organisations links with Zahira. 

 But Mistry, who stays by Zahiras side every time she moves out of Vadodara, said Vyas agreed to pay the rent after Zahira argued that she cannot work because she cannot move out.

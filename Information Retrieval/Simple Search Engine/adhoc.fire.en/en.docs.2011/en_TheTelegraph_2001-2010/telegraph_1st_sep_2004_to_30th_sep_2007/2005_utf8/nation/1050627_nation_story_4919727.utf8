 Ulfa bombs peace talks hope

 OUR BUREAU

 June 26: The outlawed Ulfa struck in the vicinity of the Assam capital for the second time in a week, triggering an improvised explosive device that injured 12 people after a nightlong orgy of violence elsewhere in the state.

 Deputy inspector-general (central western range) Mukesh Agarwal said the IED was in an unclaimed bag lying near the kiosk of a vegetable vendor, just opposite the CRPF Group Centre at Nine Mile, on the Assam-Meghalaya border. 

 The condition of three of the injured ? identified as Arun Kumar, Dharam Kumar and 16-year-old Sanjoy Bash ? was stated to be critical. Seven of the injured are CRPF jawans.

 In Sivasagar district, Ulfa militants fired at the Nitaipukhuri outpost late last night. The incident occurred a few hours after the same outfit shot dead a police officer near Talap outpost in Tinsukia district. Around the same time, another group of rebels hurled a grenade at Sivasagar police station, injuring five.

 Amid the mayhem, writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami, who is trying to broker talks between Ulfa and Delhi, said the outfits commander-in-chief Paresh Barua phoned her twice during the day to enquire about everything. 

 She said Barua told her that his organisation would respond to Delhis offer of talks but did not specify a timeframe.

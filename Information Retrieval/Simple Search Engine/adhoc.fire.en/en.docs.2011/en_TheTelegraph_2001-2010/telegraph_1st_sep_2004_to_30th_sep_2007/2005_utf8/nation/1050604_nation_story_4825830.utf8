 Harvard, Carnegie interns at Infosys

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, June 3: Forty students from foreign universities arrived at the Infosys Technologies campus today for a hands-on experience of the firms business delivery model.

 Another 60 will soon join the global internship programme ? InStep ? to work over the next eight to 24 weeks on projects ranging from application development to business consulting, education and research. The students ? from Carnegie Mellon University, Harvard Business School, London Business School, MIT, and the Asia Institute of Management ? will get a glimpse of software services and solutions in Infosyss development centres across the world.

 Through InStep, we provide an opportunity to introduce students from top business, liberal arts and technical academic institutions, to Infosys and India. It plays an important role in putting into action our management philosophy, Nandan Nilekani, the CEO and managing director of Infosys, said at the induction ceremony.

 Nilekani said this internship was the largest such institutionalised global programme in India and is aimed at displaying technological prowess and a successful business delivery model. For years, students from India have been aspiring for internships in US companies. Now, an increasing number of students from across the world are coming to India to understand our business model, he said.

 As the centre of financial and business diffuses, acquiring experience with a foreign, world-class company such as Infosys Technologies permits students to adapt with the changing global environment, said Brianna Dieter from Smith College, the US.

 Living in India definitely adds value to the internship experience. Geoffrey Gelman of Harvard Business School, said he was drawn to Infosys because of an ongoing debate in the US on the growing role of India in the world economy.

 I wanted to investigate this trend first hand and gain international experience by working at a leading IT company headquartered in India. I am excited to be here as it gives me an opportunity to learn how Infosys emerged as a global software major.

 The 100 interns were selected from over 9,000 applicants this year.

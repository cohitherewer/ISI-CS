 ?Butter? brigadier convicted

 SAMIR K. PURKAYASTHA

 Guwahati, Jan. 19: After ?ketchup? colonel it is the turn of ?butter? brigadier to batter the Indian Army?s reputation in the Northeast.

 A special CBI court here recently convicted Brig. D.A. Chansarkar of 101 area headquarters, Shillong, for entering into a ?criminal conspiracy? with Col R.K. Khanna of advance base supply depot, Guwahati, and two other civilians in a corruption case.

 Both Chansarkar and Khanna were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a year and asked to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 each. In default of payment, they would have to undergo rigorous imprisonment for another month, CBI counsel Dilip Kumar Das said today.

 A copy of the court order was made available to the parties on Monday. 

 The CBI had registered the case against the two officers on June 6, 1991, on the basis of ?source information?. 

 The agency has the right to initiate suo motu investigations into matters involving central government departments. 

 The allegation was that Chansarkar had, while working as deputy director (supply and transport) at 101 area headquarters, Shillong, during 1984-1985, along with Khanna and others, obtained huge ?pecuniary advantage? by illegal means while buying tinned butter for the army. 

 Investigations revealed that 37.5 tonnes of sub-standard butter were purchased at an exorbitant rate of Rs 52 per kg, incurring a loss of Rs 1.91 lakh. It was shown that the purchase was made from M/s M.K. Traders, a firm that later turned out to be fake. The probe also revealed that the market rate of tinned butter during the period was much lower than Rs 52 a kg. 

 Charges were framed by the court on September 27, 1996, and the verdict was delivered last month after examining 57 prosecution witnesses.

Siachen case

 Army headquarters has ordered disciplinary proceedings against the commanding officer of a battalion that falsely claimed it had killed infiltrators at Siachen. 

 Colonel K.D. Singh was the superior of Major Surinder Singh who was found guilty by a court martial for faking encounters.

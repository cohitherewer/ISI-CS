 Strays turn predators

 RAHUL BEDI 

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: Stray dogs are being rounded up and killed in southern Tamil Nadu after the starving animals began attacking tsunami survivors, especially children.

 Municipal officials in the devastated Nagapattinam district said at least 30 dogs had been killed after reports that they were attacking and terrorising refugees packed into relief shelters, particularly at meal times. ?The starving dogs? behaviour changed after they began eating animal and human corpses washed ashore soon after the tsunami,? said Shantha Sheela Nair, who is in charge of the relief work in the district.

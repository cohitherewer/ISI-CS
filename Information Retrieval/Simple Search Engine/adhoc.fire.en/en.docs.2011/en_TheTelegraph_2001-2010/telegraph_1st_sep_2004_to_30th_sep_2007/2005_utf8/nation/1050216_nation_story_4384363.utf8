 Painkiller sells despite UK ban

 RAJA GHOSHAL 

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Britain has announced the phased withdrawal of painkiller Co- proxamol, but Indian drug-makers like Ranbaxy and Wockhardt continue to sell the product in the absence of any instruction from the authorities. 

 ?The drug is under evaluation and so far no instruction has been given to the pharmaceutical companies making this drug in India,? said Ram Teke, joint drug controller in the office of the drug controller-general of India. 

 Co-proxamol is a combination of paracetamol and the opiate dextroproxyphene. It was withdrawn in Britain after authorities found that taking two tablets more than the maximum recommended dosage of eight could cause death. 

 Experts say Co-proxamol should not be taken with alcohol, sedatives, tranquillisers or other medicines containing paracetamol, which may have fatal side effects. 

 Ramesh Adige, director of corporate communications in Ranbaxy, said: ?So far we have not received any instruction regarding Co-proxamol and, therefore, our brand Sudhinol is doing business as usual. If and when regulatory instruction comes, we will comply with it.? 

 Wockhardt chairman Habil Khorakiwala said no instruction had come from the authorities and Proxyvon was still very much in business.

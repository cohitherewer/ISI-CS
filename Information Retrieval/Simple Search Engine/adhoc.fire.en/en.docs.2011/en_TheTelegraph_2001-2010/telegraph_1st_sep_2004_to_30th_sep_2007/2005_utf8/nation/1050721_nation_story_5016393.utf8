 Bangalore, July 20: Fashion 

 guru Prasad Bidappa is brimming with gratitude, but the 

 high-profile friends he said helped him walk to freedom 

 dont want his thanks.

 Most of them have denied any role in his release from a Dubai detention centre, where he was held for 33 days on charges of carrying two grams of marijuana.

 Bidappa, arrested at Dubai International Airport on June 11, was set free from the Al Rashidiya detention centre on July 13.

 On Monday, he had thanked Wipro chairman Azim Premji, UB Group boss Vijay Mallya, Maharashtra governor S.M. Krishna, Karnataka industries minister P.G.R. Sindhia and former Union minister Maneka Gandhi for letters that vouched for his credentials along with a plea for clemency.

 These letters and his wife Judiths mercy petition helped convince Judge Aysar Ahmed Fouda of the Dubai criminal court that he was not smuggling marijuana, the fashion guru said at a news conference.

 Its a miracle I was freed so soon. This is my second birth. The judge went through my wifes mercy petition and these letters and was convinced that I was not a smuggler, Bidappa, who has launched many successful models, said.

 While gratitude gushed from Bidappa, the infotech major steered clear with a terse statement. 

 While we wish Mr Prasad Bidappa all the best, we would like to point out that Mr Azim Premji did not issue any letter or a certificate for Mr Bidappas release, a Wipro statement said.

 This is complete untruth, said a Krishna aide in Mumbai. A letter was never sent along with a request for clemency.

 At the news conference, Bidappa had even spoken of how Krishna was in touch with him through a friend in Dubai and sent him messages of goodwill and pre-paid telephone cards to the detention centre.

 A spokesperson for the UB Group said she was not aware of the matter (intervention). Mallya was not available for comment.

 Maneka, however, said: Yes, I helped him (Bidappa). He is a good human being and he has done a lot for young people. I have seen him work for a lot of NGOs and at such times, very few people come forward to help you.

 She refused to elaborate on how she had helped the fashion guru.

 Industries minister Sindhia said he has known Bidappa for more than a decade and his letter only said he is a very good man.

 The Janata Dal (S) leader met Bidappa through an aide of the late Ramakrishna Hegde 15 years ago.

 Sources in the fashion industry said the heads of many institutions and companies (named by Bidappa) were angry with him for dropping names. 

 Some of them are livid that he gave away all the names, a source added.

 SC nod to Bengal teacher policy

 New delhi: The Supreme Court has upheld a policy for recruitment of primary teachers being followed by Bengal, under which those with junior basic training (JBT)/primary teachers training (PTT) certificates are given preference to those with BEd degrees, reports our legal correspondent.

 The court on September 12 dismissed a batch of petitions from several BEd degree-holders challenging the appointment of JBT/PTT certificate-holders in preference to B.Ed. degree-holders.

 It said the 20 additional marks given to those with JBT/PTT certificates according to Rule 9 of the state governments selection procedure was just and fair.

 The BEd degree-holders had argued that no extra credit shall be given for higher academic qualification at the time of selection of a teacher.

 The court said primary teachers required knowledge of child psychology. Hence, the additional marks given for the special requirement were correct.

 86 cops in net for mafia link

 Lucknow (PTI): District authorities 

 here have sent to the lines 86 police personnel for their 

 alleged nexus with a land mafia kingpin. 

 Barring the station house officer of a police station, 70 constables, eight sub-inspectors and an equal number of head constables have been accused of allegedly shielding one Laloo Yadav, sources said. 

 Forty cases of extortion, land grabbing and threatening people were registered against Yadav, who has always managed to escape the police net. 

 Probes revealed that the accused had helped him flee by leaking information. Yadav had allegedly provided plots of land to some of them in return, sources said. 

 Canada sorry

 Ottawa (AFP): The Canadian government has issued an apology to one of its diplomats whose nomination to a post in India had been blocked by the intelligence services for two years, as reported in this paper earlier.

 The government expressed regret after an oversight committee accused the security and intelligence service of botching an inquiry into the security risk posed by Bhupinder Liddar, a Canadian Sikh who was nominated to the post of first consul general of Chandigarh. 

 The diplomat said he was delighted at the decision.

 Liddar had been nominated in 2003 to the post but his appointment was immediately blocked after the probe.

 Upset father

 Vadodara (PTI): A father of six daughters 

 committed suicide after his wife delivered their seventh 

 child ? a girl ? here on Wednesday. The 45-year-old man 

 who was hankering for a son was upset by the news and hung 

 himself in his house, police said. 

 The population of Kadaknath birds, a rare black chicken found in western India, has alarmingly dwindled. In Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, the number has fallen from 80,000 to 20,000 since 2001.

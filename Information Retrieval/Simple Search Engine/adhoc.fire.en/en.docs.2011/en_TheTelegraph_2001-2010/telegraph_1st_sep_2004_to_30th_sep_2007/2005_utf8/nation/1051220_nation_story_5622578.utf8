 Schools get stick for toddler interviews

 New Delhi, Dec. 19 (PTI): Delhi High Court today gave four weeks to private unaided schools in the capital to find ways of admission to nursery and pre-primary classes without subjecting children to interviews.

 A division bench of Justices Vijendra Jain and Rekha Sharma made it clear that the present system of forcing toddlers and parents to appear for interviews was not acceptable.

 The bench suggested that the schools could adopt a neighbourhood policy, giving preference to kids residing within a five-km radius. The court said schools could also consider the feasibility of a centralised admission system and admit kids based on the draw of lots.

 Parents are being made to run from pillar to post and we want the obnoxious policy of interviewing parents and kids to go. It is a disgrace to mankind, the bench observed.

 The next hearing is on January 31, 2006.

 The court had earlier made it clear that private schools should not have the discretion to call a particular set of children for interviews. It had said that in the absence of any proper alternative suggested by the schools, the court might ban toddlers interviews from January 2006.

 Three parents had challenged a judgment which, on January 12, 2003, had rejected a plea for banning the interviewing of children and parents.

 Ashok Agrawal, the petitioners counsel had argued that the Yashpal committee, appointed by the Centre, had recommended a ban on interviewing children. Agrawal sought the ban on the grounds that it was arbitrary and violative of their human rights.

 The court had on May 6, last year, issued a public notice to all schools seeking assistance on this question of larger public importance. It had also issued notices to the human resource development ministry, Montfort School, its principal, the Delhi Lt governor and the director of education.

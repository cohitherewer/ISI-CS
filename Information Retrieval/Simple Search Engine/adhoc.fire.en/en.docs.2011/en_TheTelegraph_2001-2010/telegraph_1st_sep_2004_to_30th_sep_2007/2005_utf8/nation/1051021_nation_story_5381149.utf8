 Larger planes for holiday rush

 New Delhi: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel has said the government would allow foreign carriers to use larger aircraft during the winter months (November-March) to cope with the holiday rush. 

 It would also allow them to fly additional flights during the peak months of December and January. Patel said with bilaterals having been relaxed, an open skies policy followed earlier for the winter month was no longer needed.

 Speaking to newspersons today, the minister denied there were any moves to merge the two state-run airlines. Air India managing director V. Thulasidas had yesterday welcomed such a move. 

 Patel added that he was going to place before the cabinet a plan to hive off the ground handling and engineering units of IA and A-I, as well as a ground handling unit of the Airports Authority of India into separate companies.

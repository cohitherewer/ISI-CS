 Rabri eyes poll home run 

 KAY BENEDICT 

 Hajipur/Raghopur, Feb. 4: About 40 km from Patna, Raghopur was supposed to be the Rae Bareily of Bihar but it turned out to be a ?land of Ravanas?, especially for the non-Yadav population.

 A 25-km drive on a narrow, potholed and backbreaking road from Hajipur to Raghopur diara gives a clear picture of what Rabri Devi?s ?subjects? think of her. Bishnudeo Rai Yadav, sitting on a charpoi with a group of men at Bilawarpur Govardhan village, said: ?We voted for Rabri Devi thinking that she will nurse this constituency. See how Sonia Gandhi has worked for Rai Bareily.?

 The village falls under Biddhupur, a model block. ?But look at our plight now. The primary school across the road has just one teacher,? Yadav said. 

 Another villager, Uma Shankar Chaurasia, said there is no road to go to the nearest railway station, Chakeshkandarpur, and people have to walk a 3-km stretch to reach it. 

 The villagers said lack of power supply is another concern for them. ?We watch TV using batteries?sometimes we get electricity when we go to sleep. Lack of power is also affecting agriculture in the region. 

 Despite the lack of development and voices against the ?Ravanraj?, Rabri Devi?s victory is a foregone conclusion, thanks to the support of the huge Yadav population. 

 Vijay Shankar, a Dalit activist in Pahadpur, said: ?Even Yadav kids are aggressive. After the killing of a criminal, Rajeshwar Gope Yadav, by another Yadav criminal, there is more tension in the area. 

 The anger against the ?first couple? is such that a small outfit, Rashtravadi Janata Party, is likely to pit a local maid, Manju Devi, against the chief minister to make it a ?naukrani? versus ?maharani? fight. 

 Accompanied by Laloo Prasad Yadav and brother Subhash Yadav, Rabri Devi today filed her nomination at the Hajipur subdivisional office for the second phase of polls on February 15. 

 Soon after, Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi addressed an election meeting at the adjacent Kacheri court grounds. Union minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh too made an appearance. 

 The crowd was not impressive and appeared inattentive. Rabri Devi spoke for six minutes amid slogans of ?rajmata Rabri Devi zindabad? by RJD supporters. 

 Raghopur is sandwiched between Vaishali district and the Lok Sabha constituency of Hajipur. The former is a Yadav bastion while the latter, the stronghold of Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan.

 With reports of a dent in the minority votebank emerging after the first phase yesterday, both Laloo Prasad and his wife appealed to Muslim voters to ?beware of vote-splitters?. The RJD chief launched an attack on Paswan, saying that the LJP chief has recruited criminals to win the elections. 

 But for the caste configuration, the RJD would have lost the seat long ago. People are asking questions, even the Yadavs saying that everybody will suffer if the place remains backward.

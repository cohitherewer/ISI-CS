 Counsel snub to Anjali

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, May 20: Flying Officer Anjali Guptas request for time to engage the services of Supreme Court advocate S.B. Mishra as her defence counsel was turned down by a military court here today.

 When the general court martial (GCM) resumed proceedings this morning, the officer said Mishra would defend her on May 28. She requested the GCM for an adjournment till that day.

 However, the presiding officer, Group Captain V. Ganesh, turned down her request on the ground that she was given ample time and opportunity to engage a defence counsel. 

 It is on record that this court has given ample opportunities to the accused to be defended effectively and ensure that she is not prejudiced in her defence in any manner. The court has also given enough time to the accused to bring in a civil defence counsel. 

 Although 38 days have passed since the assembly of the GCM, the accused has not been able to arrange a civil defence counsel as yet. Therefore, while disallowing the submission made by the accused, this court will proceed further. It is also reiterated (that) the accused can bring in a civil defence counsel at any stage of this trial, Group Captain Ganesh said.

 The GCM adjourned the proceedings to May 24 to allow the new defending officer, Group Captain R. Vijay Kumar, to familiarise himself with the case. He was Guptas first choice as defending officer but could not attend the previous sittings because he was doing duty at the IAF headquarters in New Delhi.

 The previous defending officer, Wing Commander Vijay Bhupesh, was withdrawn from the GCM.

 On Tuesday, the GCM adjourned for three days to give Flying Officer Gupta the last chance to hire a defence counsel. She was arraigned the previous day on seven charges of indiscipline, insubordination and financial irregularities.

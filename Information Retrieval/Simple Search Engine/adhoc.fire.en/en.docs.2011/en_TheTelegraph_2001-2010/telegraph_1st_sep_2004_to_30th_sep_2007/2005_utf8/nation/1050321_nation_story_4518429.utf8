 Poll reward for farmers

 Chandigarh, March 20: The Congress, which ousted the Indian National Lok Dal in the recent Assembly polls, is rewarding Haryana farmers with a slew of relief measures, reports our correspondent.

 The Congress had received overwhelming support from the farmers, most of whom are Jats, in the polls ? a phenomenon never witnessed before. 

 With the rumblings over loss of crops during the recent hailstorms getting louder, the Congress government led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda today announced that relief norms for suffering farmers would be enhanced. 

 Those who have already received compensation will get additional relief according to the revised norms.

 Hooda has also decided to withdraw cases lodged against farmers by the previous regime.

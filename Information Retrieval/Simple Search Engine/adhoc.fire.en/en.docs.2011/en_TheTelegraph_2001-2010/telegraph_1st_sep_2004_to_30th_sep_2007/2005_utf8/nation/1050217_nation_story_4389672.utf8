 Desi domain debut on Net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Tatas and the Reliance group are going desi.

 India?s largest companies are staking out their cyberspace domains with patriotic dot.in domain names.

 India is one of the few countries in the world that did not have an easily identifiable domain name address. From Australia (dot.au) to Zimbabwe (dot.zw), most countries have proudly pitched their tents in cyberspace with distinctive country markers.

 India was a little slow on the uptake, one reason being that infotech companies were loath to identify themselves as Indian in case that went against them in bagging orders. All that has now changed with the dot.in domain name registry starting to take in applications from last month.

 Essar and Bharti were among other companies who have taken advantage of a ?sunrise period? from January 1 to 21 that was given to Indian companies to file their applications for their dot.in addresses.

 The country code Internet domain name registry today received an impressive response from individuals with over 24,000 domain names being registered successfully.

 Over 100 major brands like Bazee, TVS, Videocon, Air-India, Indian Airlines, BSNL and MTNL have secured their dot.in addresses. 

 However, a senior official in the department of information technology cautioned: ?They will have to renew these after the given period of one year. There is a risk of losing them if they fail to register it within the stipulated time.?

 The dot.in country code Internet domain name registry services set up by the National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) opened real-time registration for the general public from yesterday. 

 The official Internet domain dot.in for the country will now be available to anyone who wants it.

 According to an official release: ?Today, within an hour of opening, nearly 24,000 domain names were registered successfully. Tens of thousands of registrations are expected within the first few days.?

 The entire process of registration is online and the time to register ranges from 24 hours to a few minutes, from the receipt of the request from a registrant. Registrations will be offered by the registrars following a competitive pricing policy and best market practices.

 Nuke pledge to come dear

 G.S. MUDUR 

 New Delhi, July 19: Indias pledge to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities envisaged in the Indo-US joint statement released in Washington yesterday will be a difficult and expensive exercise, nuclear experts said.

 Indias assurance that it would identify and separate civilian and military nuclear facilities and open civilian facilities for international inspection, in reciprocity to US assistance in the civilian nuclear programme, has evoked mixed reactions from nuclear scientists here.

 Some experts said such an exercise was overdue, but a top scientist said it would be impractical and hugely expensive because India does not have a large nuclear weapons programme.

 India currently has 15 operating nuclear reactors and eight under construction. Only six ? two each at Tarapur, Kota and Kudamkulam, all developed with foreign technology help ? are under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards that allow international inspections of activities and material at these facilities.

 A top nuclear engineer said demarcation of Indias civil and weapons programme will be difficult because the activities are near-seamlessly integrated. 

 Its not just nuclear reactors, there are reprocessing plants and other downstream facilities, said Annaswamy Prasad, former director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. Duplicating the entire chain will be an expensive and impractical exercise.

 Prasad said India cannot afford to build parallel military nuclear facilities. India has never stockpiled. We have a small weapons programme. It works on a need-basis, depending on threat perceptions. Separate military facilities will mean keeping them idle and underutilised.

 However, a nuclear technology expert involved in Indias nuclear weapons development effort during the 1990s said India has nothing to lose by agreeing to the IAEA safeguards at some of its indigenously produced commercial nuclear power reactors.

 This proposal has been in circulation under track two. Plutonium from power reactors is a cocktail of materials not really desirable for reliable weapons design, the scientist who requested anonymity said.

 Some experts said India could designate specific facilities, such as the Dhruva reactor at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay complex and fuel reprocessing plants that extract plutonium, as non-civilian facilities and thus out-of-bounds for international inspections.

 As long as we restrict safeguards to power reactors and not to research facilities, this kind of separation could work, said a former official of the department of atomic energy.

 Such a division of facilities may help India procure foreign nuclear technology that, experts said, India will need to meet its nuclear energy targets. The US indicated yesterday that it would work towards helping India procure enriched uranium for the fuel-starved Tarapur reactors and equipment for its civilian power programme.

 Scientists say Indias nuclear power programme, dogged by delays and cost overruns, could do with infusion of western technology. Imported light water reactors from the West may help India reach its target of generating 20,000 mw of atomic power by 2020.

 But Prasad said plutonium reprocessed from the existing power reactors goes into Indias second generation fast breeder power reactors and granting safeguards to existing ones would mean opening up safeguards for fast breeder programmes, too.

 Were trying to do something new with fast breeders. Intrusive inspections will distract us from the scientific freedom, Prasad said.

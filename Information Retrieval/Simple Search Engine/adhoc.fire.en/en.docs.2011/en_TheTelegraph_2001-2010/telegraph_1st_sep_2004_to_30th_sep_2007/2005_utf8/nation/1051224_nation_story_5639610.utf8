 Dawood of 1990 on show

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 23: Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and some of Indias most wanted criminals at the 1990 weddings of his younger brother Mustaqueen and sister Mumtaz were shown by STAR News today.

 Shot in an unknown location in Dubai, the footage showed a much younger Dawood (in picture above) mingling with his family and guests at the weddings.

 The channel claims this is the first time such footage of Dawood and his key associates have been aired on Indian television. Two more parts of the four-hour exclusive will be telecast on Saturday and Sunday.

 In the hour-long first episode, Dawood was seen with brothers Anees Ibrahim, Noora, Iqbal Kaskar, Mustaqueen and Humayun and associates Tiger Memon, Chhota Shakeel and sharpshooter Sunil Sawant, who is now dead. 

 Among the guests was Pakistani comedian Omar Sharif, the channel said, adding that some of Indias white-collar personalities, politicians and filmstars were seen as well. But conspicuous by his absence was Dawoods former aide Rajan Nikhalje alias Chhota Rajan. He is said to have left the gang in 1993.

 That year, Dawood, along with Anees, Noora and Memon, figured on the most-wanted list for plotting and executing the Bombay blasts. 

 The video captured Dawood in a relaxed mood, smoking, smiling and embracing guests. He posed for photographs with Sawant, also known as Sawatya. 

 In 1992, Sawant had shot dead rival don Arun Gawlis shooter Shailesh Haldankar inside JJ Hospital with an Ak-47 for the first time. He then fled to Dubai but in 1996, Chhota Rajans men killed him.

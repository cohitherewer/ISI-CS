 Jehanabad, Jan. 31: On the five-kilometre stretch between Parariya village and Shobh, policemen trust their legs more than their jeeps. Not because they have suddenly turned fitness freaks. It is landmines they are worried about in this rebel-infested rural belt.

 Parariya is where the Maoists torched the helicopter carrying former BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu after it made an emergency landing on Saturday.

 The Maoist call for boycotting the elections and the violence they have unleashed have become talking points in Jehanabad, Gaya and Aurangabad and Nawada in the Magadh division. Social workers and political circles say the rebels can influence the outcome in as many as 30 of the 64 constituencies going to polls in the first phase on February 3, with the ruling RJD being the main beneficiary if the Naxalites go in for ?selective boycott?.

 Civil liberties activist Prabhat Kumar Shandilya said the overwhelming perception is that the ?Yadav Maoists? ? most of the area commanders and workers are Yadavs ? might work strategically for the benefit of the RJD, which is considered a lesser evil.

 Already, a star campaigner for the BJP, Hema Malini, has backed out in the wake of the violence, though BJP sources said they were trying to persuade her to change her mind.

 A total boycott call could, however, harm even the RJD. In the 2000 Lok Sabha elections in Gaya, the BJP fielded Ramji Maji while Rajesh Kumar was the RJD nominee. Maji won by 30,000 votes in the wake of strict enforcement of the boycott. But in 2004, when the BJP fielded retired IG Balbir Chand, the Maoists changed their strategy and targeted the BJP. The result was an RJD novice defeated Chand by over one lakh votes.

 Even in Andhra Pradesh last year, extremist violence had affected the BJP and the Telugu Desam Party, especially in the Telengana region.

 ?It does not look like they are attacking the RJD,? said Philip Manthara, a Jesuit priest who worked in the Naxalite belt for over 30 years. ?At least (there is) no record of any attack so far.?

 Manthara said the CPI (Maoist) ? formed last year by the merger of the People?s War (PW) and the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) ? was now spreading to north Bihar. ?The CPI-ML (Liberation) was there in the last 15 years while the presence of the MCC was negligible, but now they are gaining in strength,? Manthara said.

 In Makhdhumpur, Jehanabad, CPI-ML (Liberation) candidate Kamlesh Sharma also feels the Maoists? stand would help Laloo Prasad Yadav?s party.

 Rajeshwar Prasad, a shopkeeper, said Maoists consider Laloo Prasad the lesser evil because of their similar social background and also because they expect the RJD chief to be not as tough as the BJP-NDA while dealing with the Maoists.

 A professor in a Gaya college said after the PW-MCC merger, there has been a shift in the Naxalite policy. The Maoists, he said, would rather ?target the police and other class enemies? than ?punish voters even if they violate their diktat?.

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: The 

 Prime Minister today faced angry families as he visited 

 Safdarjung Hospital and the All-India Institute of Medical 

 Sciences (AIIMS) to visit those injured in yesterdays 

 serial blasts.

 Manmohan Singh had been walking towards his car at Safdarjung Hospital after talking to the media when some relatives began shouting slogans against him.

 Singh immediately turned back and walked up to them, to be told that the wards had been turned into a fortress and the families were not being allowed to meet the patients.

 Singh calmed them down and promised that the patients would receive the best possible treatment. Expenses in getting treatment is not a consideration. Human lives are important, he said.

 Kaushalya Madan, an elderly woman who lost her 26-year-old niece in the Sarojini Nagar blast, spoke to the Prime Minister. She later said Singh had assured help to the parents of the girl, who was the familys sole earning member.

 Singh, accompanied by health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, earlier visited the burns ward and wished the injured speedy recovery.

 Many other visitors to the hospital, who had come to claim relatives bodies, were agitated because they could not identify them from among the mangled corpses. At the Safdarjung Hospital, some relatives were seen fighting over the mutilated body parts.

 The Prime Minister today tried to calm Delhiites down, striving for normality in the run-up to Diwali and Id.

 Yesterday, in the hours after the blasts, home minister Shivraj Patil and the police had asked people to hurry back home, triggering a mad rush on the streets.

 Bill to dilute job quotas in public sector

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, June 1: The Manmohan Singh government had set out to enact a law that seeks to ease the rules for job reservations in the public sector months before its assurance to industry captains that the quota system would not be imposed on private companies.

 If it succeeds in pushing through the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes (Reservation in Posts and Services) Bill, 2004, the government will be under no obligation to enforce existing quotas in corporations functioning under various ministries where its share capital is less than 50 per cent.

 Yesterday, a statement issued by 22 business houses thanked the government for not imposing reservations and offered to help create opportunities for the weaker sections through training. 

 We recognise that industry needs to take affirmative action in a liberalised economy where the government has a reduced role and the benefits of job reservation in the PSUs for SC/STs are reduced, the statement said.

 The scope of reservations will reduce further if the bill introduced in the Rajya Sabha during the winter session is passed. A clause in the bill, now being scrutinised by a parliamentary standing committee headed by the Congresss Sudarshan Natchiappan, states that existing quotas would apply to a corporation in which not less than 50 per cent of the paid-up share capital is held by the government.

 Analysts and trade union leaders said the clause would make the governments divestment/privatisation proposals attractive for potential buyers. The proposed law, they added, would apply to boards and corporations in service sectors like power, hotels and transport.

 According to them, the proposed legislation may have been drafted keeping in mind the unbundling of perennially loss-making electricity boards. As part of the unbundling process, private companies have taken over power transmission and distribution in many states.

 The bill says that job reservations would continue to apply in the case of public sector undertakings. But PSUs would stop being PSUs the moment the governments equity stake drops below 50 per cent.

 The provision has so far escaped political attention, but there is a raging dispute on a different aspect of the bill between the SC and ST parliamentary forum on one side and the OBC MPs forum on the other.

 The former is against the proposed legislation arguing that reservations for them has a rationale that is different from that for OBCs. The forum has sought two separate laws ? one codifying all existing government reservation orders for SC/STs and the other codifying OBC reservation orders. The dispute is delaying finalisation of the standing committees report.

 However, a delegation of OBC MPs is understood to have demanded deletion of the provision that proposes to limit quotas to boards and corporations where the governments stake is over 50 per cent.

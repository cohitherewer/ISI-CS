 Lucknow, Jan. 23: Shia clerics today formalised the launch of a body parallel to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board to protect the interests of the sect.

 The All India Shia Muslim Personal Law board made the rift between the leaders of the sect and their Sunni counterparts official.

 At its first meeting here, the new board elected Maulana Mirza Mohammad Atahar chairman. The executive body also gave its approval to a draft constitution. 

 Mirza Yawar Hussain, an advocate based in Banda in Uttar Pradesh, has been asked to head the committee to frame the final constitution. On January 29, the board will have its first general body meeting.

 Atahar, 62, runs several charities and is associated with Shia socio- educational committees. 

 The board today assigned itself the task of trying to ensure social justice and education and propagating liberal social values for about six crore Shias in India. 

 The new board is yet to articulate its stand on the Babri Masjid. However, the Shia leaders hinted that they are unlikely to cross swords with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board.

 At its January 29 meeting, the new board will have 60 general body members ? six each from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and five other states. But the strength of the general body would be gradually extended to 200. 

 Atahar said the new board had the sanction of Shia ulemas. ?The Shia community suffered for long because of the poor representation in the All India Muslim Personal Law Board. As a result of this inadequate representation, the community fell victim to social injustice, scarce education and employment opportunities. The sect failed to assert itself culturally, too.? 

 The Muslim personal law board was first challenged last year-end by a Sunni sub-sect. Maulana Tauquir Raza Khan expressed discontent about the functioning of the original board, allegedly controlled by the Deobandi school, and threatened to launch a parallel body for its members. 

 Senior Muslim clerics anticipated a Shia board would be formed with MaulanaKalbe Sadiq, a respected cleric and the vice-president of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, decrying its style of functioning at a news conference here on January 2. 

 Though Kalbe Sadiq did not openly approve of a separate board for Shias, he disagreed with Sunni clerics on their stands on triple talaq and family planning.

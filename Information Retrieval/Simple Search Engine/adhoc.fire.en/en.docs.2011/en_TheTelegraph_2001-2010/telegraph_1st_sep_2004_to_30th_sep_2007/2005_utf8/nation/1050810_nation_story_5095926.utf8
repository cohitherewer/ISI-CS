 Monica plea on deaf ears

 Monica Bedi: Setback

New Delhi, Aug. 9 (PTI): The high court in Portugal has turned down Monica Bedis plea against extradition, CBI sources said today. 

 Bedi, underworld don Abu Salems girlfriend, is charged with obtaining a false passport from Bhopal under the name Fauzia Usman. 

 The little-known Bollywood actor will now have to approach the countrys Supreme Court and then the consti- tutional court challenging the extradition order, the sources said, adding that the bureau would oppose any such move.

 A similar case of obtaining a false passport from Madhya Pradesh is also pending against Salem ? wanted in India in connection with the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts ? in the high court of Portugal.

 The constitutional court has already cleared the decks for Salems extradition to India to stand trial for the blasts, which left 257 people dead.

 While seeking the duos extradition, India had given an executive assurance to the Portuguese government that Salem would not be awarded the death penalty if he is found guilty. 

 Portugals constitutional court had cleared Bedis extradition in another passport forgery case on February 24 this year. 

 The CBI had sought her extradition for possessing a forged passport in the name of Sanha Kamal Mallick from Hyderabad.

 Bedi was caught in Portugal with the passport and detained on September 18, 2002, along with Salem and two other companions.

 A formal request for her extradition was made by the government on December 27, 2002.

 The CBI petition, filed by the Portuguese prosecutor- general, seeking directives to keep Bedi in custody till her extradition case was finalised, was also accepted by the high court.

 In a desperate attempt to avoid returning to India, Bedi had appealed to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh requesting cancellation of the extradition proceedings and permission to travel to Norway where her parents are settled.

 In a handwritten letter, Bedi had sought pardon and cancellation of all criminal proceedings against her initiated by the CBI and pleaded for a second chance.

 The actor said she was scared to return as it would seal her fate.

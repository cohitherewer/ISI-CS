 Licence to kill, from sacred corns

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Sept. 2: Before the killers struck, they took divine permission. They placed 12 corns in a semi-circle before the house and did a puja.

 Then they took another look. The positions of the corns seemed to have changed in a pattern that told the tribesmen they should go ahead with their plan.

 Sunil Pardi, arrested after his gang killed a former IIM Lucknow professor, wounded his wife and looted valuables and cash yesterday, has told police the Pardi tribe considers crime a sacred ritual.

 The travelling criminals, based in Guna, Madhya Pradesh, first pick a house to rob. Then they carry out their corn ritual to find out if they have their deitys blessings to strike.

 Although Sunil got caught, its my own mistake, he said.

 Around 2 am on Thursday, the gang raided Dr S.K. Singhs house, 3/25 Vinay Khand, in Lucknows posh Gomtinagar locality. They broke open the grille, entered the bedroom and smashed the 62-year-old academics head with a blunt weapon, killing him instantly. 

 The gang then attacked his wife Shubha. The 58-year-old woman, though injured seriously, managed to save her life by slipping into a dark corner. The gang then stashed valuables worth several lakhs into their bags and left.

 Sunil, keeping watch outside, was the last to start running and was caught by a police patrol.

 We (the watchers) mimic the sounds of animals to alert fellow gang members when there is any threat. I started barking as soon as I saw the two policemen; they all ran away but I could not, he told the police.

 The Pardis are notorious for their ruthlessness. Having arrested one, we hope to bust the entire gang, said city senior superintendent of police Ashutosh Pandey.

 Sunil, 30, said Pardi gangs vie with one another to gain notoriety. Upcoming young criminals strive to make a name for themselves in the hope of marrying the daughter of a man who runs the strongest and most ruthless gang.

 A child learn the ropes and the rituals from the age of 10. Before joining a gang, he has to be trained by a village elder. He is taught how to mimic animals and birds, and how and where to hit a man with a blunt weapon to kill him, Sunil told the police, demonstrating his skills by replicating the howls of dogs in the night and the chirping of various birds.

 The gang hawks bangles, sweets and other ware during the daytime, looking for suitable targets and working out the plan of operation. The tribals never use guns or knives, they just club their victims to death.

 The Pardis were confined to Andhra Pradesh before Independence, when the Raj branded them criminals under the Criminal Tribes Act. They were later resettled in areas of Madhya Pradesh.

 This was the first time the Pardi gang, which has about 10 members, had struck in Lucknow. They had carried out robberies in Delhi in the late 1990s, in Ludhiana in 2000 and in Gwalior in 2001-02.

 Faith ebbs in brutal panchayats

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Muzaffarnagar, July 4: Like the others in her village, Amna Begum believed in what they called their parmeswar. 

 Yesterday, she lost faith in this god. Assaulted by members of the panchayat in Buranha, a village in Muzaffarnagar, the sobbing 32-year-old today limped to the office of superintendent of police D.K. Chowdhary to seek justice.

 Amna had appealed to the village council after her husband Israil Khan pronounced the triple talaq to divorce her when she demanded her share of the family property to finance the treatment for a stone in her kidney. Instead of getting justice, the panchayat branded her a woman of dubious morals, echoing the allegation of her husband.

 Look at me. I am indisposed and weak. How can I be called a woman of loose morals? Amna, escorted by some women activists, asked Chowdhary. The police officer accepted her written complaint and ordered a probe.

 Amna is not the only one in this Uttar Pradesh district who has lost faith in the panchayat system. A 10-year-old girl in Charthwal, the same hamlet that became infamous after the Imrana case, must be thinking that justice always goes in favour of the boys.

 The girl had come sobbing to the council of elders after being raped by Kamil Ansari, a 19-year-old, on June 27. The panchayat held a session and ruled that the boy should be lashed 15 times with a discarded shoe and the case hushed up as it would bring a bad name to the village.

 The accused is also in his teens. What could we have done? We cannot stone him to death, can we? asked Rashid Anwar, a council member.

 About 55 km away, a panchayat in Bijnor district, ordered a newly married couple to say we are brother and sister 50 times. Their crime was they had eloped to get married.

 This is happening in villages irrespective of caste or religion. Love is a taboo in every caste group and lovers are treated with violence, said Sabirti Jain, a social worker based in Meerut.

 In Nirana village under Sikhera police station, Raishuddin and Ershad raped Mehrana before murdering the 19-year-old on June 25. The police arrested Raishuddin and, two days later, Ershad gave himself up to the panchayat and confessed.

 The police arrested Ershad but the panchayat went a step further. It ruled that Ershads family be evicted from the village. His house was ransacked and his parents and sisters were driven out.

 The rulings are just a few instances of irrational stands taken by panchayats in the states hinterland. From asking a rapist to marry a victim to breaking up a marriage, the panchayats have delivered brutal justice, social workers alleged, pointing out that there have been at least 14 cases in which lovers have been killed.

 Last week, police in Bijnor enforced a complete ban on convening caste panchayats whose edicts have caused law and order problems. But Muzaffarnagar district police remained unfazed. In a democratic country, caste panchayats have their own roles. These are platforms that settle minor disputes. We cannot declare a ban on them, said Chowdhary. 

 Of course, we will take action if any panchayat decision contravenes law and violates the human rights of innocent people.

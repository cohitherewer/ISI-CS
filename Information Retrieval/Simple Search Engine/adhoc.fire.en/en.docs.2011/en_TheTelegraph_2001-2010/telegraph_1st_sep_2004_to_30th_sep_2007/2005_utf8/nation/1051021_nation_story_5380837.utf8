 Jail term for road rage

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bus brawl

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: A Delhi court today sent a stern message to competing public buses and drivers on short fuse by sentencing two men to four and five years rigorous imprisonment for road-rage attacks.

 A cleaner of a city bus, Balram, got four years plus a Rs 1,000 fine for attacking the conductor of another bus, Ravinder Kumar, with an iron rod on November 21, 2003.

 A taxi driver got five years and a Rs 2,000 fine for injuring a scooterist with his kirpan after they had collided near Ashok Vihar in north Delhi.

 Delhis buses are notorious for mowing down pedestrians as they race and overtake one another on crowded roads to earn that extra buck. Balram had attacked Ravinder after the latters bus had overtaken his on the Janakpuri-Shahbad route in west Delhi.

 When the buses reached Mongolpuri, Balrams bus raced ahead again. The cleaner then got his bus to stop in front of the other, climbed down and entered the second bus. He attacked Ravinder with an iron rod as horrified passengers watched.

 Delhi has witnessed many shocking road-rage murders. Former national roller and ice-skating champion Jagraj Singh, 45, was given a life term for killing Ravi Chaudhry in a fit of extreme rage on April 29, 2000. 

 Chaudhry and his family were returning home from a party in their car when it collided with Singhs Gypsy. A quarrel broke out and Singh drove his Gypsy over Chaudhry, dragging him for about 20 yards before fleeing the spot.

 The Institute of Road Traffic Education says the capital has the largest number of motor vehicles ? 4.4 million ? in the country and accounts for 7 per cent of Indias road traffic. According to institute founder Rohit Baluja, its natural that road rage is so common here.

 Road rage is the result of mismanagement of traffic where the right of way is not defined. When road rage turns into a crime, it is because of traffic; it is not because of a criminal tendency, Baluja said. 

 Like, if I steal your right of way or the traffic lights fail or when bus drivers try to make money?. In these cases, there is no defined traffic management plan and there is an idiotic situation prevailing on the roads.

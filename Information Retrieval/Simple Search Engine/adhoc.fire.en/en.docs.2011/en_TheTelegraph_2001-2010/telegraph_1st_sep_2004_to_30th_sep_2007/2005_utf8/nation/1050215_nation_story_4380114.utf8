 Stubborn survivors breathe life into camp

 Port Blair, Feb. 14: Albinus, Zahid and Johnson have created quite a stir. In January, the three healthy, blissfully unaware infants took their first breath in an unsettled world. A day later, they were taken to the Nirmala School relief camp, the tsunami having stolen the home they would never know.

 The will to live on these islands is stubborn, and celebrated. The 900 neighbours at Nirmala took part in a birthday bash ? complete with cake, new clothes and entertainment. These three babies, after all, survived their mothers? anguish, through days with no food in the jungles.

 The hand of God, feel these parents, protected the unborn. The born had a benefactor, too: Jessie, a 25-year-old woman, surfaced at Pillopanja last week, 45 days after the tsunami, having survived on the fruit of the rainforest.

 There is little fuss about these new arrivals. The Nicobarese mothers, who all had natural deliveries, spent just one night in hospital, bringing the tiny infants back to the open-air camp the very next day. The authorities didn?t feel the occasion should go unnoticed, so they organised a small party. They took it one crucial step further as well. ?We asked the parents to stand up and talk about the experience of escaping in that condition,? says Father Albinus, who put the families in slightly secluded areas to give what little privacy is possible.

 Frisca, who gave birth to Jonathan Bharath on January 26, spends the whole day inside the mosquito net, draped with a dupatta to screen her and her newborn. ?We were afraid,? she recalls, ?when the water came. I ran into the jungle. For days, we lived off coconut water.? Now, Jonathan, named after the priest who arranged the vehicle to take her to hospital, is on breast milk, while his mother is given what the rest of the camp inmates have ? dal, rice and subzi.

 The directorate of health services has registered 150 antenatal and 82 postnatal cases in camps across the islands. ?There have been no reported miscarriages, stillbirths or maternal deaths so far,? says Madhur Bala, state family welfare officer. Iron capsules and milk are being given to pregnant and lactating mothers. Unicef, which has started distributing fortified biscuits to children between the ages of six months and six years, is discussing the feasibility of providing dietary supplements to pregnant and lactating women.

 There is one worrying risk, which existed in pre-tsunami times as well. ?There is only one hospital in Port Blair with gynaecologists, where surgery can be conducted in case of complications,? explains Bala. This means patients living in far-flung islands have to be airlifted to the capital if an emergency arises. If trouble is expected, mothers are advised to be within safe distance of G.B. Pant Hospital well before the delivery date. ?There are 6,000 deliveries a year, of which five per cent require surgical intervention,? she adds.

 There will be many more births before April 15, by which time mothers hope to shift to intermediary shelters. Two more babies are on their way at the Nirmala camp alone, which should give the sisters a cause for cheer. They are all waiting for a girl, so she could be named after one of them.

 Minorities set to seek progress plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Bihars political parties must do more than just flaunt their secularism to win Muslim votes this time.

 In a state election headed for a triangular contest, the community will back only those who have a definite agenda for the economic and social uplift of Muslims.

 All prominent Muslim bodies in Bihar will meet this week to decide exactly what commitments to extract from whoever wants their support ? Laloo Prasad Yadav, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Congress or the communists.

 Mere rhetoric, like Paswans demand for a Muslim chief minister, has failed to impress the community which, after 15 years of supporting Laloo Prasad, is asking tough questions and demanding answers.

 The date for the meeting has not been fixed. 

 Qasim Rasool Illyas of the All India Muslim Pers-onal Law Board said it is scheduled for the end of the week. 

 All the main organisations ? the Imarat-e-Sharia, Jamat-e-Islami, Izar-e-Sharia and Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind ? will take part.

 We have been trying to get all the secular parties together. We will continue these efforts. But as that does not seem to be happening, we have to strategise and see who is best suited for our needs, Illyas said.

 We will, of course, vote for a secular party. But that party has to have an agenda for the development of Muslims. In the forthcoming meeting, we will decide on whom to support and clearly spell out our needs. We want our leaders to make specific commitments. You wont be able to mobilise people this time only because you are secular, Illyas said.

 Among the demands are the rebuilding of cottage industries, rural schools and hospitals and reservation benefits for the backward classes among Muslims.

 Maulana Abdul Hamid Nomani of the Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind said the Congress and Laloo Prasad have been told of the demands.

 We held a state-level function on September 4 in Patna. Digvijay Singhji, Laloo and Mohsina Kidwai had come. They obviously cannot make any announcements because the code of conduct is in force, Nomani said.

 The politicians have sensed the change in mood. At a meeting in Delhi on August 31, Laloo Prasad had read out from a list of what he had done for Muslims in the past 15 years.

 Bihar was the first state to set up a minority welfare department. I opened a university for Arabic studies. Urdu teachers were appointed in schools. We want to give reservation to Muslim women, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief said.

 Some Muslim bodies, like the Izar-e-Sharia, have been tilting towards Paswan, but he cannot be sure of the strength of their support.

 Paswans demand for a Muslim chief minister will only harm Muslims, said Husna Ahmad Qadri, general secretary of the Bihar unit of Jamat-e-Ulema-e-Hind.

 We have never demanded that a Muslim should become chief minister. Why is he communalising the atmosphere? We want development and a strong commitment on that. How will a Muslim chief minister help us?

 The division in the Muslim votes, leaders say, shows the communitys growing aspirations. 

 You cant get our support by raising Gujarat and Godhra repeatedly. Let us see whether you have a vision for the impoverished Muslims of Bihar and we will think about it, a prominent Muslim leader said.

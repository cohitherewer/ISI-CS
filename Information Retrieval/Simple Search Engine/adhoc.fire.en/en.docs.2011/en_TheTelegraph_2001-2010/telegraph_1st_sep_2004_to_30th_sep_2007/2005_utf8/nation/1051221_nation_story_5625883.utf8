 First Sikh in Pak army

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: The Pakistan Army has recruited its first Sikh soldier ? 19-year-old Harcharan Singh from Lahore ? in what is being seen by Indian Sikhs as a paradigm shift in Islamabads attitude towards its minorities.

 Religious and political Sikh leaders on this side of the border have welcomed the appointment of Harcharan, who hails from Guru Nanaks birthplace, Nankana Sahib. He cleared the Inter Services Selection Board Examinations at the second attempt. 

 It is a very positive development, said Harvinder Singh Sarna, one of the most influential Sikh leaders who is also the president of the Delhi Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee.

 After 58 years, a Sikh being selected for the army shows that perhaps the attitude of the Pakistan government towards Hindus and Sikhs is finally changing. 

 Several Christians have served in the Pakistan military and a few Hindus have also worked in the Pakistan Air Force. 

 Pakistani Sikhs, said Sarna, have till now considered an entry into the army next to impossible. 

 Most Pakistani Sikhs think the military is, in a way, forbidden for them. This (the recruitment of Harcharan) might help them in considering the army as a career option.

 Goa ?loser? has last laugh

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Feb. 2: A Congress-led government was sworn in tonight in Goa, capping a dramatic day that saw governor S.C. Jamir sack the Manohar Parikkar regime hours after it emerged victorious in a controversial confidence vote.

 A two-member ministry with Pratapsinh Rane as chief minister and Independent MLA Philipe Neri Rodriguez as his deputy was administered the oath of office and secrecy by Jamir at a ceremony in Raj Bhavan half an hour before midnight.

 Earlier, BJP leaders had slammed Jamir as a ?henchman of the Congress? and demanded his recall. ?The action?is nothing short of murder of democracy?, party chief L.K. Advani told a news conference. ?It is now obvious that the governor?s reprehensible action is part of a premeditated conspiracy??

 The rival Congress said the governor had ?no option but to dismiss the government?. Party leader Girija Vyas said Speaker Vishwas Satarkar?s move to disqualify Independent legislator Rodriguez just before the trial of strength was ?unconstitutional and dictatorial? and enough ground to question the validity of the vote.

 The speaker had rejected the demand of the counsel for Rodriguez for more time to give his comments on the disqualification petition filed by the BJP against him on the ground that he had violated the anti-defection law.

 Congress general secretary Ambika Soni said as the voting right of the MLA was taken away, the trial of strength was not in order and the governor had to step in when the Congress-led Opposition registered its protest with him.

 Jamir had yesterday asked Parikkar to seek a vote of confidence after four MLAs of the ruling combine resigned from the 40-member House, reducing his government to a minority.

 BJP leaders said they would meet President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam tomorrow and seek his intervention in the ?restoration? of its government. The party also demanded the immediate recall of the governor. 

 ?I regard this as a command performance at the instance of the Congress high command. He (Jamir) had been sent only for this purpose and he executed his job,? Advani said.

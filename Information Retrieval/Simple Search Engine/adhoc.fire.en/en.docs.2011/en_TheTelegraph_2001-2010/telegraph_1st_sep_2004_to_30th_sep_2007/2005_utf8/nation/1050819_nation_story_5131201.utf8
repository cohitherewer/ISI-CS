 We-told-you-so murmurs in Delhi 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The blasts in Bangladesh yesterday were a message from fundamentalist militants that they now have the wherewithal to strike anywhere in the country at will, according to an assessment in the Indian defence establishment.

 India believes its security interests and those of a secular government in Dhaka should be the same. 

 But Dhaka has persistently refused to acknowledge ? particularly in meetings between the Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles ? the presence of militant camps in Bangladesh. 

 Indian Army sources say there is evidence to support the belief that Northeast insurgent outfits are given succour by fundamentalist outfits in Bangladesh.

 The armys concern arises from its counter-insurgency operations in the Northeast. The international border is covered by the BSF. 

 Since December 2003, in the Indian militarys view, good neighbourliness is to follow the Bhutan example. That month, the Bhutanese army, aided indirectly by India, destroyed Ulfa camps in its southern limits bordering Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. 

 The Indian defence ministry has noted that not only Bhutan but also Myanmar has cooperated in undertaking coordinated operations against Indian insurgent groups in the Northeast that take refuge or operate from camps in Myanmar.

 Far from agreeing to joint action against militants, Dhaka is even reluctant to admit that such camps exist.

 In its annual report for 2004-2005, the defence ministry says: Bangladesh has remained indifferent to the rising influence of political parties and organisations of fundamentalist and radical Islamist orientation in Bangladeshi society and government. 

 It has been insensitive and unresponsive to Indias concerns regarding the presence and activities of Indian insurgent groups from the Northeast and the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence on Bangladesh soil, large-scale illegal immigration and the criminalisation of the border. 

 Political violence and assassinations against internal political opponents have risen alarmingly, and gone unpunished.

 Based on its assessments of rising militant violence in Bangladesh, military officials who review the security scenario in the sub-continent say the Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh and/or the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (whose leaflets were found at some of the spots) could be telling the Dhaka government that their influence is not confined to one particular region.

 The violence also buttresses the Indian standpoint that Dhaka has been tolerant with Islamic fundamentalist outfits who rally support by fanning anti-India sentiment. These outfits also have a nexus with militant outfits such as the Ulfa and the NLFT operating in Indias northeast and provide them shelter, military intelligence officials say.

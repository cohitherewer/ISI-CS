 Districts in jobs race

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wants to implement the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act in 200 districts as early as possible. The trouble is only 150 districts have been identified.

 The government has started panicking because choosing districts has now become a political demand with almost every MP insisting his constituency should be included.

 The first 150 districts were selected by the Planning Commission. The criteria for selecting the districts were their SC/ST population, wage status and productivity.

 The remaining 50 districts, too, will be selected by the Planning Commission. But the process has been inexplicably delayed.

 Rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has written to the Planning Commission, asking it to send the list of 50 additional districts. Although the list has not yet been finalised, the ministry has initiated dialogue with states on how to implement the act.

 Raghuvansh is cornered by demands from almost all parties, chief ministers and individual MPs to include additional areas in the project.

 Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje has met Raghuvansh with her list of priority areas. In yesterdays meeting of rural development ministers of all states, the Haryana minister demanded that the Centre include Mewat region.

 I receive requests and proposals by the hour. I have forwarded all of them to the Planning Commission. The process of identification is a very sensitive issue. It has to be totally impartial. The government should not be accused of being partisan in selecting areas for ensuring rural employment, Raghuvansh said.

 He conceded the delay in identifying the 50 districts had become a cause for concern. They should send it now. But one understands it is because choosing priority areas is a very difficult job. But we need the list to start the whole process.

 Choosing the districts is the first step. After that, the state government has to come up with a perspective plan on how the act is to be implemented. The Centre wants to start the process before the end of this year.

 ?800000 target price for Tipu collection 

 London, April 10 (PTI): A range of works of art, weaponry, textiles, books and photographs relating to India ? including the Tipu Sultan collection ? will be auctioned by Sotheby?s for two days from May 25.

 The Tipu Sultan collection was built up by Robin Wigington, author and leading authority on the Mysore ruler?s firearms, over a period of 30 years. It has since changed hands but remained intact. The most important collection of its kind ever to come to the market, it is estimated to fetch over ?800,000.

 The single-owner sale will include an outstanding group of weaponry and other rarities captured after the British stormed Tipu Sultan?s palace at Srirangapatnam near Mysore in May 1799. 

 One of the important highlights of the collection is an exotic gem-set trophy sword, which is estimated to fetch ?50,000 to ?70,000. 

 The pommel was taken from Tipu?s regalia of office and was evidently made to match the eight larger tigers? head finials, which surrounded the rail of his celebrated gold throne.

 The throne itself was described by European visitors to Tipu?s court and was clearly a thing of great wonder supported by a life-size tiger made of gold inset with rubies, emeralds and diamonds. After the siege, British soldiers broke the throne into pieces. 

 The collection also includes a magnificent embroidered tent canopy ? stitched with tiger stripes in gold and silver thread ? from the throne, which is estimated at ?30,000 to ?40,000.

 The weapons are highlighted by Tipu?s silver-mounted flintlock sporting gun with the stock carved in the form of a leaping tiger, by Asad Khan Muhammed, Mysore, in 1793-94. The tiger detailing even extends along the barrel of the gun, which flashes with tiger stripes. It is estimated to fetch ?80,000 to ?120,000.

 Other highlights include two field cannons from Tipu?s palace with barrels in the form of roaring tigers. One is estimated at ?30,000 to ?40,000 and the other is likely to fetch ?25,000 to ?35,000. 

 Other items include Indian carved jade, marble and sandstone products as well as Mughal and Ottoman luxury textiles. 

 One of the most important highlights in the sale, which will contain around 165 lots and is estimated to fetch more than ?2.2 million, is a 17th century Mughal dagger that is estimated at ?80,000 to ?120,000.

 Sleuths sniff for Abus AK-47s

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Nov. 18: The CBI is wondering how it can get Abu Salem to sing about the missing AK-47s.

 Dawood and co. are believed to have received about 500 guns (AK-47s and AK-56s) ahead of the 1993 Bombay blasts, of which only 140 have been traced so far.

 As Salem and Ejaz Pathan, a close aide of Dawoods brother Iqbal Kaskar, were in charge of receiving and distributing arms used in the blasts, the extradited don could throw crucial light on where the missing guns are.

 We have the total list of the arms consignments that reached India. Police have so far been able to trace only 140 of the 500 guns that were received by Dawoods gang, a senior Mumbai police officer, who did not want to be named, said.

 He said the police had information a large part of the cache was still hidden somewhere in the city. But they had not been able to track it because of various constraints and lack of evidence.

 Salem can throw crucial light on this since he was closely involved in the distribution of arms. We have told the CBI about this, he said.

 Investigators said they had evidence several caches of arms and ammunition from Pakistan were ferried to old jetties and ports in Raigad and Sindhudurg districts of Maharashtra via Porbandar in Gujarat.

 Salems job was to liaise with two top Karachi-based smugglers, Mustafa Majnu and Mohammad Dosa, who would ferry the consignments.

 When two major caches of plastic explosives and assault rifles landed at Dighi jetty and Shekhadi coast in Raigad, Salems aides hid them in cardboard boxes and sackcloth and shifted them to Mumbai.

 Indian customs officials knew of the landings but believed they were normal consignments of smuggled gold, a source said.

 According to CBI files, about 27 criminal cases were registered at police stations in Bombay and Thane and Raigad districts of Maharashtra. Investigations disclosed that Muslim sentiment was deeply hurt after the Babri demolition and the riots and blasts that followed.

 The ISI of Pakistan, taking advantage of the hurt feelings of the Muslim community and the surcharged atmosphere, incited? Dawood Ibrahim, Tiger Memon and Mohd. Dossa to seek revenge by causing bomb explosions and by committing other terrorist acts, the files said.

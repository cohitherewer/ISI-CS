 Call to cut H-1B visas in US 

 Washington (PTI): Several organisations 

 and individuals, including lawmakers, are seeking drastic 

 curbs on issuance of the H-1B visas to hire skilled workers 

 from abroad, though the industry, government and a large 

 section of the US Congress seem to think otherwise.

 The H-1B visa programme has no serious safeguards to protect American workers from being replaced and is abused to employ cheap foreign labour, said Tom Tancredo, a Congressman. The visa limits cannot be justified now when so many skilled Americans are unemployed, he said, referring to the 6 per cent unemployment in the US.

 In the next 10 years, the US will be losing 800 IT jobs daily due to offshore outsourcing, Tancredo said.

 News.com, a tech news website, recently reported that Wipro told its investors that its ability to compete and serve clients in the US may be impaired if immigration laws are changed, making it more difficult to obtain visa.

 Lookalike drama in court

 New Delhi (PTI): A person against whom 

 a non- bailable arrest warrant was issued in a looting case 

 appeared before a Delhi court to find out that his lookalike 

 was the culprit.

 A kiosk owner near New Delhi railway station, who allegedly looted people by serving drinks laced with drugs, made plans to hoodwink police in the event of his arrest after seeing Raju Biswas from Calcutta. He collected information about his lookalike Raju.

 On being picked up, he told the police that his name was Raju and gave his Calcutta address. An arrest warrant was soon issued against Raju. 

 The court, however, asked for a fingerprint test, which led to Rajus acquittal.

 A fresh arrest warrant has been issued against the actual accused.

 Jailed for love 

 Lakola (PTI): A youth has been sentenced 

 to three months in jail for saying I love you 

 to a girl.

 In 2003, Nitin Nikhalge had intercepted the girl, who was going on a bicycle with her friend. He caught her hand and said he loved her, the prosecution said. 

 Mahatma alert

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): A red alert has 

 been sounded in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi for a godman for 

 allegedly grabbing over thousand acres of land, including 

 some entrusted to Meeraben, a Gandhi disciple. Mahatma 

 Ramla Chariya had fraudulently taken over a 1,200-acre plot 

 in Meerabens ashram at Rishikesh and declared himself 

 its head. 

 Sex slur on cop

 Akola (PTI): A police officer has been 

 accused of allegedly outraging the modesty of a lady Shiv 

 Sena leader. She complained that she had called up the deputy 

 superintendent of police (home) and asked him to appoint 

 her son as he had passed the exam. But the officer allegedly 

 demanded sexual favours or Rs 5 lakh. 

 Over 300 handicraft traders and artisans will go to Dubai in October to take part in the Global Village Festival. The four-month festival will have 1,200 stalls for over 40 participant nations.

 DD foes meet Jaipal 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 26: A clutch of sports broadcasters today met information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy to oppose compulsory sharing of feed of sporting events of national interest which the Centres draft downlink policy proposes.

 According to sources, at the one-and-a-half-hour meeting with ESPN STAR Sports, Ten Sports, Zee Sports and Sony, Reddy tried to find a solution to serve markets that do not have a cable presence without harming the business interest of the private channels.

 We had a very productive meeting with the minister and he seemed really keen on addressing the various issues we raised, said a spokesperson on behalf of the four broadcasters.

 The meeting comes at a time when the Dubai-based Ten Sports is locked in a tussle with national broadcaster Doordarshan over sharing telecast rights for the upcoming tri-series, featuring India, in Sri Lanka.

 At the meeting, the broadcasters also tried to explain the use of alternative technologies like low-power transmitters in case of satellite channels having to share live telecast with DD.

 Ten Sports has proposed using DDs 250-odd low-power transmitters to reach the broadcast of the Sri Lanka series to areas not served by cable, instead of providing a simulcast on the DD network. DD has shot down the offer.

 The broadcasters also discussed the impact of a must-provide clause in the proposed downlink policy on their subscription revenues and requested that the list of notified events for mandatory feed sharing must adhere to the most stringent of norms.

 The policy, which was referred by the cabinet yesterday to a group of ministers headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, makes it mandatory for private channels to share feed of sports event of national interests with Prasar Bharati, which manages Doordarshan.

 Ten Sports today wrote back to Prasar Bharati, requesting it to refrain from interfering with (its) contractual rights. 

 In the letter, addressed to DD director-general Navin Kumar, Ten Sports chief Chris McDonald cited the example of the England and Wales Cricket Board recently selling exclusive rights for all cricket played by its national team in England for the next three years to Sky, a satellite channel.

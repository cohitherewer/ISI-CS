 New Delhi, Nov. 21: Yes, lock kiya jaye. Amitabh Bachchan is definitely out and Dev Anand it will be ? together with Telugu film icon Chiranjeevi ? wholl declare the International Film Festival of India open at Goa on November 24.

 The festival authorities today made their choice of celebrity guests public, ending the controversy triggered by the Goa governments invite to Bachchan to do the honours and the squashing of the move by the Union information and broadcasting ministry.

 As a cautious government refused to reveal its choice till the last moment, speculation raged with several names popping up, including those of Shahrukh Khan and Sanjay Dutt.

 Bipasha Basu and Kannada star Tara will be the traditional thali girls at the opening ceremony.

 New I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi will skip the inauguration as he will be busy with the Parliament session, but his predecessor, S. Jaipal Reddy, under whom the festival arrangements were made, will be present.

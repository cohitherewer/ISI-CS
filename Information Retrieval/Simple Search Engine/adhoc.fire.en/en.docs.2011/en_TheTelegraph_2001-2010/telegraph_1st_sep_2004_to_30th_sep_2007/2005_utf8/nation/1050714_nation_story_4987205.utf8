 Sonias neutral card

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, July 13: Sonia Gandhi has picked relatively neutral but assertive leaders as Congress presidents in three states where factional fights were being fought to seize control of the party apparatus.

 The underlying factor behind Sonias choice became evident today when she decided on the state chiefs for Punjab, Karnataka and Jharkhand.

 Former MP and state minister Shamsher Singh Dullo has been named the new president in Punjab in place of H.S. Hanspal.

 After his efforts to stay on proved futile, Hanspal, who enjoys the backing of AICC general secretary Ambika Soni, bowed out two days ago. 

 Pranab Mukherjee, who holds charge of Punjab Congress affairs, is understood to have been instrumental in elevating Dullo. 

 The defence minister sought to bring in a person who is not expected to openly align with three distinct groups in the state Congress. One is headed by chief minister Amarinder Singh, the second by senior minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and the third by Soni.

 Soni is believed to have tried to retain Hanspal by proposing that the post of a working president be created. That did not come through.

 Dullo is seen as an assertive leader. Being a Dalit, his appointment is seen as a conscious effort on the part of the high command to win over the weaker sections for the 2007 Assembly poll. Dalits constitute nearly 23 per cent of the states population, which had prompted the BSP to make a determined effort to establish its presence in Punjab.

 In Karnataka, too, the high command opted for a Dalit leader, Mallikarjun Kharge. He is not identified with any particular faction.

 Kharges assertive style could make coalition partner H.D. Deve Gowda see red. However, the Janata Dal (Secular) leader will be happy that incumbent state Congress chief B. Janardhana Poojary, Gowdas bitter critic, has been replaced. 

 Kharge, a senior state minister, will have to give up his berth in line with the partys one-man-one-post policy.

 For Jharkhand, the high command has opted for Pradeep Balmuchu. He replaces Kunti MP Sushila Kerketta, who became the state unit president just over six months ago. 

 Former chief minister Samir Ranjan Burman was named the Tripura Congress unit president.

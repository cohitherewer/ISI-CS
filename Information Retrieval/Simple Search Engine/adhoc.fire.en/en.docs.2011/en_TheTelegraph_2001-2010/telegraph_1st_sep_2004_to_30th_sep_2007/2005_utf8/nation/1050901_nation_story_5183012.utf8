 Indian shot in Dhaka

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dhaka, Aug. 31: An Indian businessman was today shot dead in front of a hotel in an upmarket area in the Bangladesh capital.

 Mazid Alam, 45, died in Dhaka Medical College Hospital where he was rushed after being shot in the forehead and abdomen outside Hotel Heritage Inn in Banani district, police said, adding that eight persons held in connection with the killing were being questioned.

 The Delhi-based Alam, a regular visitor to Dhaka, used to work as an agent for various Bangladeshi firms importing Indian rice. Alam used to approach exporters in Delhi and other cities and help in striking a deal between the companies. He would get a hefty commission for this purpose, said a senior intelligence branch official. The killing could be the result of a dispute over payments, he added.

 In Calcutta, Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department, said they were totally in the dark about the killing. The Indian high commission in Dhaka has been asked to keep in touch with Bangladesh police.

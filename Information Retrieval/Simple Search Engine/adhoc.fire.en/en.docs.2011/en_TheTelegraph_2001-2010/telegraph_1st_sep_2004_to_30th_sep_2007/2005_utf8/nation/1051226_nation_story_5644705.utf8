 Nepal hotel row sends guests packing

 Kathmandu, Dec. 25 (PTI): A five-star hotel in Nepal was vacated on Christmas Eve following a row over pay hike between its management and the workers union.

 The management of the hotel, owned by Radheshyam Sarraf ? who is of Indian origin ? asked the tourists, mostly European and some Indian, to vacate the rooms, which were 40 per cent full, a hotel employee said.

 The management of the the Yak and Yeti decided to vacate the rooms after the Nepal Independent Hotel Workers Union asked it to implement a decision that the annual pay of the hotels 288 employees would be raised by 6 per cent, said Bishwo Suvedi, the unions joint secretary.

 The decision was taken after an agreement was signed between hotel officials and representatives of trade unions and the labour ministry.

 The 270-room hotel, which stands at a prime location in the Nepal capital, had to cancel Christmas Eve and New Year celebrations during the peak tourist season, resulting in a loss of millions of rupees, a hotel staffer said.

 Sarraf is in Delhi, where he also has a stake in Hotel Grand Hyatt, according to the staffer. 

 The other employees were not available for comment. 

 Established in 1977, the hotel also houses Casino Royale but its operation has not been affected by the pay-hike decision.

 The hotel was in the news recently after the police force providing security to the American Centre and the US embassys visa section ? both located on its premises ? stopped Chinese ambassador Sun Heping and conducted security checks on him leading to a strong reaction from the Chinese embassy.

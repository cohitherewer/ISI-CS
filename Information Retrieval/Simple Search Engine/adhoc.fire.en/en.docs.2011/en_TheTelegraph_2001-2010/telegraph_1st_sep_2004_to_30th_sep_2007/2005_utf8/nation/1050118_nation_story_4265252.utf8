 Laloo leaves one for Congress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 17: Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav today released his party?s first list of 58 candidates for the Assembly elections in Bihar, which includes eight Muslims and about a dozen Yadavs.

 Of the remaining six seats in round one, the RJD left three for the CPI, two for CPM and one for the Congress, which is likely to have ?friendly? contests with Laloo Prasad?s party in around 20 seats.

 The RJD?s list has at least three relatives of senior party leaders as candidates ? Amit Rana, son of fodder scam accused MP R.K. Rana, from Gopalpur, Union minister Akhilesh Singh?s wife Veena Devi from Arwal and Union minister Kanti Singh?s husband Keshav Prasad Singh from Piro.

 RJD spokesperson Shivanand Tiwari will again contest from Shahpur. Senior ministers Jagdanand Singh, Shakeel Ahmad Khan and Raghavendra Pratap Singh are being repeated from Ramgarh, Gurua and Barhara respectively. Former road construction minister Iliyas Hussain, who resigned after his name figured in the bitumen scam, has been given a ticket from Dehri.

 State Congress president Ram Jatan Sinha, meanwhile, declined to contest from Warsaliganj in Nawada after he was denied a ticket from Makhdumpur, the constituency he was eyeing, in Jehanabad.

 Lok Janshakti Party?s sitting member Aruna Devi is once again the party?s candidate from Warsaliganj and the Congress cited this as the ?reason? for bowing out of the race ?since it was a sitting seat of a UPA partner?. The RJD has fielded Ramashray Prasad from the seat.

 From Makhdumpur, the RJD has fielded its sitting member Bagi Kumar Verma, who will be pitted against the LJP?s Ramashray Prasad Singh, who left the Congress yesterday.

 The RJD left only one seat for the Congress in the first phase ? Kahalgaon, from where Assembly Speaker Sadanand Singh will contest again but the five constituencies left for the CPI and the CPM are not the sitting seats of the two Left parties.

 Congress workers reacted strongly to the ?raw deal? given to the party by the RJD but blamed senior party leaders for the ?mess?. The state party chief himself cut a sorry figure because he was denied a ticket from Makhdumpur.

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: They climbed out of the two DC-10 aircraft chatting among themselves, oblivious of the demonstration outside the airport. For the nearly 100 US air force personnel who arrived at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport today, it would be only a few days stay at Calcutta.

 Unperturbed by the CPM protests at the airport and in front of the Hyatt Regency where they checked in, the personnel were looking forward to the Indo-US war games at Kalaikunda.

 We will be flying to Kalaikunda in a couple of days. This is our main contingent, said Colonel J. Paulk. 

 Flying officers, engineers and other crew members have arrived in two aircraft with the equipment. There will be 250 personnel taking part in the operation and 12 F-16 planes will be reaching here.

 The two aircraft touched down at 1.16 pm and 1.40 pm, airport officials said. The Americans were driven to their hotel in four luxury coaches amid tight security, a pilot car leading the way.

 The buses entered the hotel around 4.30 pm amid chants of down with imperialism and go back US army. The US personnel, some of them women, immediately checked in. Asked about the demonstration going on outside, one of the officers said, Demonstration? Yes there is one but no comments on that.

 The airport was abuzz with talk that six US air force F-16s had been diverted to Kalaikunda at the last moment. We had received a message that these aircraft would land. But for some reason they were diverted, a senior airport official said.

 The tarmac bustled with activity. Apart from the two DC-10s, several IAF aircraft ? an IL-76, an Avro and two helicopters ? also touched down. More IAF planes are expected tomorrow, an official said.

 About 200 CPM activists led by Amitava Nandi, MP from Dum Dum, stood in front of the international terminal, condemning the Centre for holding a joint military exercise with the imperialist US.

 This exercise is a threat to the internal security of the country and we cannot be a silent observer. We will demonstrate at every place where these US planes land or where the US team stays, Nandi said.

 The demonstrators, however, kept about 100 feet between themselves and the terminals gate and left long before the US crew emerged out of the building.

 Though chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will not participate in any of the protest rallies, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas and Left Front chairman Biman Bose will.

 Asked about Bhattacharjees decision, Biswas averted a direct answer. There are many leaders in our party and all of them will participate in the protest rallies. For instance, while Bimanda will be at the Calcutta airport, I shall attend the rally near the USIS, he said.

 Biswas added that defence minister Pranab Mukherjee had already discussed the protest programme with Bhattacharjee.

 For Cope India 2005, the US air force is flying in a squadron (between 12 and 15) of F-16 Fighting Falcons of the type that the IAF is considering for an order of 126 multi role combat aircraft. The F-16s are being flown in from US airbases in Japan.

 The US air force is also deploying airborne early warning aircraft to India for the first time for the exercise. IAF aircraft such as MiG 27s (based in Kalaikunda), Sukhoi 30K, Mirage 2000, and MiG Bisons will fly alongside them.

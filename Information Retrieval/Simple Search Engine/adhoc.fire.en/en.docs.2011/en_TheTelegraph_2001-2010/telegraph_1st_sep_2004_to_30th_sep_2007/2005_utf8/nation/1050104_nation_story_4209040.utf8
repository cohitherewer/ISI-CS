 Dozen more to climb for mountaineers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gangtok, Jan. 3: Mountaineers now have 12 more peaks to choose from.

 Looking for ways to boost tourism, the Sikkim government has decided to open peaks, other than those considered sacred, within the state for climbing from the next tourist season.

 State tourism minister R.B. Subba made the announcement a few days ago at Mangan, the North district headquarters, while inaugurating a music festival there.

 Subba said: ?When I visited Europe for the World Tourism Meet recently, there were a lot of enquiries on mountaineering. During our presentation in London, Paris, Milan and Rome, tour operators said many mountaineers wish to come to Sikkim.?

 The state government notification prohibiting climbs on Kanchenjunga (8,585m), considered the guardian deity of Sikkim, and Siniolchu (6,887m), Kabru (north) (7,388m), Kabru (south) (7,317m), Rathong (6,679m), and Mount Narsing (5,825m) remains effective.

 Even for the peaks that have been opened for climbing, the minister said mountaineers would ?not be allowed to cross 20,000 feet?. 

 ?On another front, the district collector (north) has been empowered to issue inner-line permits to domestic tourists going beyond Singhik in north Sikkim,? Subba said

 The development means that tourists can now go beyond Singhik to Yumthang, Lachung and Gurudongmar, for which permits were earlier issued by the Sikkim tourism offices in consultation with the state home department.

 Subba said the government would appeal to the Union home ministry to allow foreigners up to Gurudongmar lake, near the Chinese border.

 ?We are also thinking about skiing in Gnathang, east Sikkim,? Subba said. ?We will study the amount of snow that is deposited there during winter before taking a decision,? he added.

 Teachers on pay protest path

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, April 26: Hundreds of unaided teachers of Bihar?s affiliated schools and colleges demonstrated near the secretariat here today to press their demands for regularisation of jobs and payment of salaries.

 Unaided teachers of about 3,000 institutions have been fighting for their rights for several years. Former chief minister Jagannath Mishra had introduced the educational policy for unaided teachers in 1982. 

 According to the policy, the government allowed both the teaching and non-teaching staff to continue with their jobs without pay till their posts were sanctioned.

 Significantly, many institutions liberally appointed employees, most of them apparently unqualified, despite not having sanctioned posts. Some universities later even recommended their cases to the government for recognition.

 Mishra later nullified the policy and set aside Rs 72 crore for payment when he returned to power in 1989. But, he was unable to implement his plans and the next year, Laloo Prasad Yadav replaced him as chief minister of Bihar.

 According to an estimate, about 1 lakh teaching and non-teaching employees of 200 degree colleges, 450 intermediate colleges, 1,200 Sanskrit schools, 1,000 middle schools, besides many madarsas have been affected by the government?s ?failure? to do away with the unaided education policy of the government.

 ?So, many of our people are on the verge of starvation. Our children and families suffer due to non-payment of salaries for over 20 years now,? said Jainarayan Singh Madhu, an executive committee member of the Vitrahit Shiksha Samyukt Sangharsh Morcha.

 The agitating members of the morcha today took out a rally here and a delegation met the chief secretary and submitted a memorandum. ?Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam has assured us of prompt action following the intervention of the governor,? Madhu said.

 The morcha announced that it would take out demonstrate in Delhi before the President on May 9.

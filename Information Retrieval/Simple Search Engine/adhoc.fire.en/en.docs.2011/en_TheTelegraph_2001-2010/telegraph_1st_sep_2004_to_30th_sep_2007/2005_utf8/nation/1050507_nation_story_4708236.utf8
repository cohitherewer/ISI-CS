 Zahira mother backtracks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 6: Shehrunnisa Sheikh, mother of Zahira Sheikh, the star witness in the Best Bakery case who has turned hostile, today identified the figure of her daughter-in-law Yasmin in a police video shot after the carnage. 

 This contradicts her previous statement before the special court in Mumbai hearing the case.

 Shehrunnisa, who was summoned from Gujarat for re-examination by the prosecution, identified Yasmin in the video shot on March 2, 2002, after the police reached the bakery.

 Shehrunnisa had told the court earlier that Yasmin, who is now estranged from her son Nafitullah, was not present during the carnage.

 Today, she admitted Yasmins presence at the bakery while the police were there, but claimed that she did not know how Yasmin reached there. She suggested that Yasmin had arrived on the morning of March 2 after the carnage or was brought by the police.

 Yasmin, who told the court that she was present during the carnage with other members of the Sheikh family on the bakery terrace, has accused Zahira and her family members before the judge of accepting bribes and turning hostile in the case.

 Shehrunnisa said she could not identify in the video the figure of an old woman, believed to be her mother. Although the figure of an old woman coming down from the bakery terrace was clearly visible, Shehrunnisa said it did not look like a human being. ?It looks like a bundle,? she said.

 The prosecution believes Shehrunnisas mother, said to be present during the carnage, too, could provide crucial evidence about the circumstances of the death of Qausar, Shehrunnisas brother, who lived in the bakery and is believed to have been burnt by the rioters. The Sheikh family has denied any knowledge of his death. 

 Shehrunnisas re-examination will continue on Monday, to be followed by the re-examination of Nafitullah and Zahira, proclaimed hostile by the prosecution in the case.

 Mind your mobile, hackers on prowl

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 14: Imagine being in a restaurant, sipping coffee, when you suddenly receive this SMS: Looking bewitching in your pink top.

 Maybe you decide to ignore it as a prank. But the next one could cause you panic: Wonder what ud look like without the pink top.

 The mobile phones vulnerability to hacking has put millions at risk.

 One could now steal everything in your mobile: e-mails, bank and passport details ? everything that you consider personal and confidential, says the teenage guru of ethical hacking, Ankit Fadia.

 The 19-year-old whiz from Delhi is in Hyderabad to publicise his latest book, An ethical guide to hacking mobile phones, published by Macmillan India Ltd.

 The book, Fadias fourth, tells you how your life and savings could be invaded through your mobile ? and how to protect yourself against this.

 One could hack SIM cards, steal sensitive data, copy the address book or intercept passwords without your knowledge, Fadia said. Whats worse, the hacker could use your mobile for his business and personal activities and make you cough up the bill.

 He plans to write a fifth book on how gullible people allow themselves to be hacked in spite of the latest technologies to protect themselves.

 Ethical hacking is the practice of hacking into someones network ? say a banks ? to show them how vulnerable they are and then to teach them how to protect their systems from criminal hackers. 

 Fadia, who turns 20 in a few months, had shot to fame as a 14-year-old ethical hacker during the Indo-Pak cyber warfare a few years ago. He had helped the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, among others, to rejuvenate its website after it was hacked into and defaced by Pakistanis.

 In the past five years, hackers on both sides of the border have defaced each others websites and uploaded a lot of derogatory stuff, Fadia said.

 He is worried that the Pakistanis are getting the better of the exchange, as India is still slow and lacks seriousness in dealing with the problem.

 For some time, Fadia had conducted courses and run a school for ethical hacking in Hyderabad. Already a billionaire, he is doing his B.Tech from Stanford University.

 He had also worked with the CBI and US intelligence agencies in the fight against cyber terrorism in India and abroad.

 He plans to collaborate with the Kuoni Academy of Travel to start a course for travel BPOs. The academy will have centres at Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi and Chennai.

 The cyber guru, however, has another ambition: to open a restaurant either in Pune or Ahmedabad. Cooking is a skill I fancy, he said.

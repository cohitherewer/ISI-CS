 it will apprise the Supreme Court about its request to close 

 15 cases against former Union minister and Congress leader 

 Satish Sharma for alleged irregularities in allotment of 

 petrol pumps and gas agencies, reports our correspondent.

 ?We will be informing the Supreme Court about the closure report and the matter is being examined,? the bureaus special public prosecutor told designated judge Pratibha Rani.

 He said the agency was preparing an affidavit in this regard. The court had on April 4 asked the agency to inform the apex court regarding the closure reports as it had dealt with the cases earlier.

 The bureau had filed a closure report in the cases against Sharma, who was Union minister for petroleum and natural gas between 1993 to 1996, as the home ministry had refused to sanction his prosecution.

 The agency had cited a letter from the home ministry stating that the law ministry was consulted on the matter and it was decided not to accord the sanction.

 FIRs were lodged against Sharma on the basis of a complaint by H.D. Shourie, the director of a non-government organisation, Common Cause, in January 1996. 

 He had alleged that officials of the petroleum and natural gas ministry were abusing their official position by showing undue favour to some allottees in the sanctioning of petrol pump and gas agencies.

 Dole on table for out-of-work hands

 MONOBINA GUPTA

New Delhi, Jan. 24: The government is planning 

to introduce a benefit scheme for workers in the organised sector who are jobless 

because of closures, retrenchments and lock-outs in their companies.

 Workers who have been part of the Employees? State Insurance (ESI) scheme for at least nine months will be the beneficiaries. The scheme covers 72 lakh workers and 2,75,000 factories throughout the country. 

 According to sources, final touches are being given to the unemployment benefit plan, which would soon be approved by the cabinet. 

 The proposed scheme would provide relief to organised sector workers in cities while the National Employment Guarantee Scheme is expected to create jobs or grant unemployment dole for the rural poor.

 Under the benefit scheme, a jobless worker will get 50 per cent of his last drawn salary for six months at least. It means a worker who has been drawing Rs 6,000 before his retrenchment will get Rs 3,000 as unemployment benefit. Officials said they have begun with a six-month period but will try to extend it later to a year. 

 The ESI board is scheduled to meet on February 7 to finalise the scheme. The proposal will then be put up before the cabinet. The officials are hopeful of a cabinet clearance without any hitch.

 Usually, the finance ministry puts a spanner in the works because almost all such schemes begun by various other ministries require additional money from the finance ministry. This scheme, however, does not require money from the finance ministry. 

 The ESI organisation will put in the entire amount from its own reserves. 

 The organisation invests its money in nationalised banks and the Reserve Bank of India. At present, the organisation is flush with funds. 

 Officials claimed the organisation will not need to borrow a single penny from the Consolidated Fund of India, managed by the finance ministry. 

 They stressed that unemployment benefit is a major social security concern in developed countries. 

 Labour experts have also been arguing that since globalisation is here to stay, the government should introduce social security measures for workers who may suddenly find themselves jobless.

 Restructuring the economy involves displacement of labour and also loss of jobs. Experts say comprehensive social security schemes will have a cushioning effect on the unemployed till they find new jobs. 

 They also stress that social security benefits should go hand in hand with schemes for skill upgradation of workers.

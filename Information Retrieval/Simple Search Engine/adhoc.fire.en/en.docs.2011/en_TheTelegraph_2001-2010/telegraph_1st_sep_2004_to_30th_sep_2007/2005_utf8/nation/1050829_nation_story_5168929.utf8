 UP killing

 Lucknow, Aug. 28: The Uttar Pradesh Congress today intensified its campaign against the Samajwadi Party government after a youth leader was murdered by alleged supporters of Raja Bhaiyya, reports our special correspondent.

 District youth Congress president Satish Shukla was preparing to leave for a panchayat poll counting centre at 11 am when four people raided his house and fired at him from close range.

 The 29-year-old died on way to a hospital in Allahabad.

 As news of Shuklas death spread, Congress supporters forced commercial establishments to down shutters. A bandh-like atmosphere prevailed in Pratapgarh.

 State Congress chief Salman Khursheed alleged that the murder was committed by Samajwadi Party members.

 Contract child-bearer flees husband

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 Garhmukteswar (Ghaziabad), 

 Feb. 20: It was an indecent proposal with a twist. Sonia 

 had become Mukesh Tyagi?s second wife with hopes of gaining 

 Rs 72,000 and having a ?husband?. But the orphan has returned 

 to the ashram and does not want to go back to him.

 Mukesh, a 41-year-old Haryana businessman, and his wife Santosh had been childless for years when, in May 2004, the woman convinced Sonia to marry her husband and bear his child. The 21-year-old ? an orphan staying at the Adhyatmik Mahila Anath Ashram in Garhmukteswar ? agreed as she felt she would gain security in the form of money and a husband.

 However, the dream soon turned sour when Sonia failed to conceive. ?The trouble started soon when I did not conceive. They started calling me names and ill-treating me. Perhaps it was because Mukesh started paying more attention to me after the marriage,? Sonia said.

 ?At night, Santosh would insist that I have sex with my husband in front of her and would hit me when I refused. However, she would not agree to do the same in front of me,? Sonia said.

 The Tyagis later alleged that Sonia was pregnant but had an abortion.

 Now the orphan has gone back to the ashram.

 Sonia had earlier married gas-agency owner Sachin Mittal but was then sent back to the ashram within 10 days of the wedding after the Brahmin family discovered that she was ?actually Sonam, a Muslim?.

 The Ghaziabad senior superintendent of police, Jai Narayan Singh, said cases under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including adultery, have been registered against Mukesh, Sonia and Pandit, the ashram manager.

 Garhmukteswar circle officer Sanjay Rai said he had received a complaint from the Tyagis that Pandit alias Sunil Kumar Sharma and his wife Poonam had sold the girl to them for Rs 72,000.

 ?The Tyagis have also alleged that Poonam had called on them after Sonia had returned to the ashram in October and demanded Rs 3,000 a month as maintenance as the orphan was supposed to be pregnant,? Rai said.

 Ghaziabad police have decided to find out the truth about Sonia?s pregnancy and, on Friday, the orphan was sent to the local government hospital for a medical examination and a test to determine her age.

 Pandit said the decision to marry Mukesh was Sonia?s own. ?My only fault was that I did not stop her and she misused the fact that she was an adult. Otherwise, I would never have agreed to this marriage,? he said.

 Pandit and his wife had met the subdivisional magistrate of Garhmukteswar and given in writing that they had refunded Rs 50,000 to Mukesh. 

 The police said Mukesh is willing to take Sonia back. However, the orphan does not want to return to him.

 The Haryana businessman admitted that he had made a deal with the manager of the ashram at Brij Ghat near the bank of the Ganga for taking Sonia ?on rent? for Rs 72,000 for having a baby.

 Mukesh has alleged breach of contract by Sonia and the ashram in a written complaint to the police.

 However, the SSP said ?the contract itself is null and void ab initio (from the beginning) and all the persons involved are accused in the eye of law and thus cases were registered against all of them?.

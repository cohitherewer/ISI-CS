 Many takers for pipeline

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, July 24: Several leading oil and gas companies, including some from countries that are close US allies, have expressed interest in the proposed India-Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project, sources said.

 Global players in the field of oil and gas like Frances Total, Italys ENI, Japans Mitsui, Russias Gazprom and some from China have been knocking on the doors of India, Iran and Pakistan ? the countries through which the pipeline will run. 

 The estimated cost of the pipeline that will traverse over 2,600 km is around $7.4 billion. But if there are delays, the cost will go up by $1billion every year.

 During a recent interview in the US, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had raised doubts on whether any international consortium was willing to come forward to invest in the project because of the uncertainties of the situation in Iran.

 But a senior Indian official involved in the pipeline project said: We have an embarrassment of riches.

 He claimed that all the leading global oil and gas companies have shown keenness in investing in the pipeline. This apart, leading Australian company BHP-Billiton is the founding sponsor for Iran in the project.

 A source said the big global players were coming forward as they were aware of the international law of best practices that keeps such mega projects beyond the vagaries of day-to-day politics and ups and downs in bilateral relations. 

 Our aim is to get safe and secured gas to meet our growing energy needs, he said.

 He said the doubts raised by the Prime Minister about several aspects of the pipeline were legitimate. 

 But these concerns are not specific to either Iran or Pakistan. They are legitimate concerns that are raised every time a pipeline of this magnitude involving several countries and covering such great distance is thought of, he said.

 Singhs remarks have been seen by the Opposition as well as the Left parties as a dilution of Indias commitment to the pipeline with Iran.

 The Left parties, who are crucial to the UPA coalition governments survival, have made it clear that going ahead with the pipeline will be an acid test of Indias sovereign foreign policy.

 Free ride

 Calcutta, May 6: The Allahabad additional divisional railway manager was suspended today allegedly after penalising Laloo Prasad Yadavs supporters travelling without tickets on the Rajdhani Express.

 The supporters were said to be accompanying two Rashtriya Janata Dal MPs. During an inspection in Allahabad, the official hauled them up.

 The Railway Board suspended him today. Sources said the board could not have initiated such an action without the ministers consent.

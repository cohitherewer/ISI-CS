 Jehanabad student missing for three days

 Patna, Jan. 30 (PTI): In yet another case of suspected abduction, a Class IV student of Jehanabad district has been missing for the past three days even as police interrogated 10 people in connection with the Kislay Kaushal kidnapping today.

 Ranjan Kumar, a student of Diamond Public School, went missing on January 28. His family members have lodged a complaint with Town police station in Jehanabad apprehending abduction for ransom, police said.

 Ten suspects, including the mother and sister of Pappu alias Vicky, the key man of gangster Chunnu Thakur, now lodged in Hajipur jail, were subjected to a marathon interrogation in the state capital.

 Claiming that a breakthrough has been achieved in the Kislay case, police said the abducted boy was likely to be rescued in a day or two.

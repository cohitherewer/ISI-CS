 Kids storm Raj Bhavan

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Jan. 28: The latest round of protests over the kidnap of schoolchildren in the capital today saw hundreds of students demonstrating before Raj Bhavan demanding the safe release of the abducted Kislay and other missing children of Bihar Sheriff and Bhagalpur.

 Governor Bhuta Singh met a student delegation and assured all help to restore Kislay, Ravikant and Deepak to the schools safe and sound.

 Kislay, Class IX student of Patna?s Delhi Public School was abducted on January 19. Ravikant and Deepak, Class IX students of DAV Schools of Bihar Sharif and Bhagalpur, went missing within a span of two days early this week.

 Armed with placards, students of leading public schools in uniform braved the morning rain and raised slogans before the governor?s residence for over an hour.

 Singh is said to have expressed his desire to come out and meet the agitating students, but the model code being in effect he chose not to.

 He listened to the delegation comprising 10 students and five members of various student organisations.

 ?The governor has assured the delegation that he would talk to the Centre over the issue and direct the state officials to pursue case earnestly,? a source said.

 D.K. Singh, president of the Bihar Public Schools and Children?s Welfare Association, said the agitation would be intensified day by day till the boys return home safe.

 ?If the boys don?t return in two days, we will launch an indefinite state-wide agitation,? Singh said. 

 In Patna, some guardians too lent their support. ?If the kids are not rescued, we will boycott franchise this time,? some mothers said.

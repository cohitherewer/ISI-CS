 Sailors keep faith in sea

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 Andaman Sea, Jan. 8: ?Why should I be afraid? I have grown up in the water,? says seaman Sandeep Nair, aboard MV Wandoor, with all the cockiness of a 21-year-old. ?I was sipping tea when the waves came in,? he grins.

 With only jade waters, white foam and salt spray as company, you learn to trust the sea. You learn that as the sun goes down, the dazzling emerald depths will turn brilliant midnight blue; that there are channels of current that must be avoided for smooth passage; that even in shallow waters, the sea bed hides a path deep enough through which your vessel can safely glide.

 Or, in a few merciless moments, its force tears your faith to shreds.

 On Havelock island, there is a boat tied to a post in the middle of a vegetable field. Many dinghies were thrown off the beach by the tsunami, smashing them into homes further inland. Fear of another disaster has kept the men and women from going back to catch their living. High-water alerts prevent them from leaving their boats without a leash.

 And with the topography throwing up sudden surprises, captains are sticking to the long, safe routes.

 Security ceased to have meaning the morning the sea lashed out in a fit of rage.

 But for larger vessels, ironically, water proved to be the safest place on December 26. The closer you are to land, the more chances there are of the vessel being hurled against the pier. Away and anchored, the very waters that crushed thousands on the soil of the Andamans act as rocky, but reliable, cushion.

 The chief engineer of the Wandoor is Ashok De. The ship he was with, MV Teal, was dry-docked when the wave struck. Fortunately, no one was on board when the boat was wrecked.

 ?I wanted to serve the people in these difficult times,? says De, who could have easily fled home to Ultadanga in Calcutta. But he resisted the pleas of friends and family. ?The native seamen have no fear now. They know that, to live here, they have to face nature. But many people from the mainland are rushing back.?

 De came aboard the high-speed vessel to replace its previous engineer from Tamil Nadu who had been desperate to go home. He is the only member of the crew in civilian clothes, uniform lost with the Teal. 

 A few of the other sailors are also in rather battered clothes. For days, trips made between islands turned out hundreds of refugees who had nothing, some without even enough to cover themselves. ?We gave them our uniforms. It was the only thing we had,? Nair says.

 Sacrifices made to the sea, for these men, are not in vain. Nair?s uncle and aunt clung to the grills of their home in Car Nicobar when the waters swept through the village. ?My aunt lost her grip and let go. But the next wave brought her back before she floated too far away. What the water takes away, it always gives back,? muses the young man.

 Optimism is still an essential ingredient in these parts. The coming high tide hangs thick in the air. Captains and crew are on the alert for the first sign of surging waters, following which they will put safe distance between boat and harbour. 

 The riders to the sea are quick to forgive what keeps them afloat.

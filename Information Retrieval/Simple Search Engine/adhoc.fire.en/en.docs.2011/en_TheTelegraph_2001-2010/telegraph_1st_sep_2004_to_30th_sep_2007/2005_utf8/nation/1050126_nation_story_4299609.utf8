 Karat fires sovereignty salvo at Centre

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: Prakash Karat, tipped to be the next CPM general secretary, today accused the Manmohan Singh government of compromising the country?s ?national sovereignty?.

 ?The NDA government had grievously hurt the country?s national sovereignty. The threat persists even today despite the installation of a new government at the Centre,? he said. 

 The politburo member was inaugurating a new office from where the CPM will coordinate its activities ahead of the 18th party congress that will be held in Delhi in two months? time. 

 From all indications, Karat will take over the party reins from Harkishen Singh Surjeet who has been general secretary for three consecutive terms.

 In his address to party workers at the new office, Karat said the CPM was supporting the government only to keep the BJP-NDA out of power. The CPM saw no fundamental difference between the policies of the NDA and the UPA, he said.

 Safeguarding national sovereignty was one of the key issues for the CPM, he said. ?In the last eight months of the UPA government, the Left has taken the right stand to defend national sovereignty.?

 He had a long list of grievances against the government, mostly on its economic policies. ?We are not going to accept the patent amendment bill which will hike drug prices,? Karat said. The CPM, he added, would not accept any hike in FDI cap in print media or in the telecom, insurance and civil aviation sectors. ?We have heard about the government?s proposal to disinvest its 10 per cent equity in BHEL. We are going to strongly oppose it,? he said.

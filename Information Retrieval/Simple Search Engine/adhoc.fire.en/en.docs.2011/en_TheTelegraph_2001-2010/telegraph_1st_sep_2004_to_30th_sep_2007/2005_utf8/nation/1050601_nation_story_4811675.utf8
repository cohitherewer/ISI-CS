 Munda leaves Buddha speechless

 SALMAN RAVI

 Bhattacharjee 

 Ranchi, May 31: After Arjun Munda spoke, the others had little to say. 

 That, recounted senior officers who attended yesterdays eastern zonal council conference, summed up the proceedings of the conclave being held after 14 years. 

 Sources said the member states, mainly Bengal, had geared themselves up to take on Jharkhand for its reluctance to part with minerals. But Mundas presentation, in which he detailed how the mineral-rich state had been discriminated against for decades, turned the tables.

 A senior official attending the meeting admitted that even Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could not respond effectively when Munda questioned the role of Damodar Valley Corporation. 

 Mundas presentation was so incisive that the states that wanted to take on Jharkhand, restrained themselves from doing so, the officer said.

 The officials said nothing substantial was discussed. The event was organised after such a long gap. There are many issues which need to be deliberated at length. The meeting could have been a platform to bridge the differences between the states. It was much ado about nothing, the official said. The conference folded up in two hours.

 Nothing concrete came up except the decision to appoint a nodal officer for coordination on joint anti-insurgency operations and Union home minister Shivraj Patils suggestion on jail reforms and disaster management groups.

 The proceedings began around 10 am yesterday and ended by 12.30 pm after which some members, including Bhattacharjee and his Orissa counterpart Naveen Patnaik, returned.

 Patil admitted it would take some time for the royalty issue to be sorted out. Issues concerning the railway network from Jharkhand to Paradip port, raised by Munda, could not be discussed at length due to time constraints. 

 The meeting should have been stretched for another couple of days and should have continued till all the pending issues were sorted out finally, sources at the Jharkhand chief ministers secretariat said.

 Medical quota rap on states

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court today asked 

 state governments to devise ways to fill up the 50 per cent 

 seats in the all-India quota for post-graduate medical courses 

 reports our legal correspondent.

 A bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and D.M. Dharmadhikari asked the director-general of health services and the Medical Council of India to submit details on this. 

 The court also issued a notice to the Centre on a petition seeking reservation benefits for Dalit Christians ? those who are Scheduled Castes but have converted to Christianity.

 A division bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur issued the notice after hearing counsel Prashant Bhushan for the petitioner, Centre for Public Interest Litigation, and posted the final hearings for August.

 Bhushan has argued that ?when reservation benefits were available to Dalits following Hinduism, Buddhism or Sikhism, there is no reason why Dalit Christians should be not given similar benefit?. He said this would fulfil the constitutional mandate of ?equality before law?.

 In another case, the court vacated the non-bailable warrant against gutka baron Rasiklal Dhariwal on the ground that he had ?cooperated? with the CBI in its investigations with the underworld nexus with certain gutka manufacturers in the country.

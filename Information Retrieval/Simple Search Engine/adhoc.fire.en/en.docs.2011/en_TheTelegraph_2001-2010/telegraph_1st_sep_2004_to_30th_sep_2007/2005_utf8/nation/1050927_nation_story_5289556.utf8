 Dhaka seeks BSF training

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Bangladesh Rifles, which has been blamed for killing several Border Security Force personnel, including Commandant Jeevan Kumar, has sought to train its men at the BSFs training centre in Tekanpur.

 The Bangladesh Rifles request will be taken up at the four-day director-general-level talks between the two forces beginning tomorrow, said home ministry sources.

 The BSF director-general, R.S. Mooshahary, said the initiative could lead to better confidence-building measures. We wont mind our boys going across the fence if BDR can offer good training facilities. These kinds of mutual exchanges that have been tried and executed with Pakistan and China can herald a new era of peace on the eastern borders, he said. 

 Sources said the force would also discuss co-ordinated patrolling by BSF and BDR and the erecting of fences 150 metres from the border.

 The BSF will also raise the killing of Commandant Jeevan Kumar and the director-general is likely to do some tough talking with his counterpart so that such incidents do not recur.

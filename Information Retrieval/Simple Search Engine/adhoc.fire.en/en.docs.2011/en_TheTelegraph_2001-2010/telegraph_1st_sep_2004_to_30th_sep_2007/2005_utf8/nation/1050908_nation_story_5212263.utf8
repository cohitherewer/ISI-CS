 Khurana exit stamped

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: BJP president L.K. Advani today expelled Delhi BJP leader Madan Lal Khurana for six years for gross indiscipline and criticising the party leadership openly. 

 A disciplinary committee had yesterday recommended the action against the former Delhi chief minister.

 A statement issued by the party said Khurana was found guilty under Article 25 (GH) and (CH) of the party constitution. His action of going to the media without raising his views in party forum was found to be an act of gross indiscipline. He was also found guilty of criticising the party leadership openly.

 Advanis decision would be conveyed to Khurana, the statement added.

 Khurana was suspended from the party on August 20 after he repeatedly said he was unable to work under Advani. He also sought Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis removal and demanded an apology from the party for the post-Godhra violence.

 Asked if Khuranas expulsion was a message to other dissidents like Yashwant Sinha and Babulal Marandi ahead of the Chennai national executive, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said: The BJP attaches tremendous importance to discipline and members are expected to air their viewpoints in party fora and not through the media. 

 At a meeting of the Delhi BJP MLAs today to discuss the floor strategy to take on the Congress government over power shortage in the Assembly session, only one MLA, Harsharan Singh Balli, slammed the central leadership for expelling him. Khurana is a must for BJP in Delhi. In fact, Khurana is BJP in Delhi, he said.

 Asked if the local BJP would split over Khuranas expulsion, Balli said: We will not break, but we will bring Khurana back.

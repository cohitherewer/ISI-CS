 Girl killed for gamble protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 3: An 18-year-old college girl was bludgeoned to death by a gangster and his associates this afternoon in the old city area, sparking widespread violence and arson.

 The instant justice was meted out because the girl, Parveen, and her mother had protested against a gambling den in the locality.

 The alleged murderer, Virendra (32), and his associates are absconding. The incident took place around 6 pm in Sawadatganj of Lucknows old city.

 A drunk Virendra and his associates were overseeing the gambling when Parveen and her mother Suraiya passed by on their way home from a medicine shop.

 The daughter and mother protested against the area being converted into a gambling den. In a fit of rage, Virendra first assaulted the girl and threw her to the floor, police said. He then picked up a slab of concrete and repeatedly hit Parveen on her head.

 The girl died bleeding and no one came to her rescue. The gangsters then attacked Suraiya, who has been admitted to hospital with wounds.

 After the gang fled, public anger erupted on the streets of Lucknow. An enraged mob set ablaze all gambling cells, attacked passing vehicles and set the criminals houses on fire.

 Power to pardon lies with Pervez

 Islamabad/New Delhi, Aug. 24: Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri has said that President Pervez Musharraf is the last authority to grant clemency to Manjeet Singh, the man accused of having killed many by planting bombs in Lahore, and two other Pakistani cities.

 The prisoners relatives in India have insisted that he is Sarabjit Singh, who had strayed accidentally into Pakistan and was arrested.

 Confusion had arisen during the day on who has the right to grant clemency after the Pakistan information minister suggested that only the relatives of those killed in the blasts can pardon the accused.

 However, according to the Pakistani constitution, only the President can decide clemency appeals. If the accused is tried under Islamic laws, the relatives of the aggrieved person or people can pardon the convicted person.

 The President is already aware of the case. If the mercy petition comes to him, he will take it on merit, Kasuri told reporters in Islamabad.

 Commenting on suggestions that Sarabjits is a case of mistaken identity, the minister said: The question has never been raised earlier. He himself admitted before the courts that he had been changing his name and been involved in blasts and terrorists activities.

 On humanitarian grounds, Kasuri said, a senior foreign ministry official had looked up Manjeet at the Lahore jail and satisfied himself that the prisoner is in good health.

 Indian high commissioner Shiv Shankar Menon today met Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Ahmed Khan and sought quicker consular access to the prisoner to establish his identity.

 Khan reportedly told the high commissioner that the matter is being looked into.

 Legal experts said the Pakistan Supreme Court has not yet delivered a full written judgment. What came last week was a preliminary verdict, the details of which were released through official media.

 Sarabjits lawyer can file a review petition after receiving the written judgment. He will have about 30 days to file the review petition.

 PM last resort

 Indian officials in Delhi today sought to play down the reported assurance of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to a delegation from Punjab that he would take up the matter with Musharraf.

 The Prime Minister will intervene only as a last resort, a source said.

 The issue is likely to be raised when foreign secretaries of both sides meet in Islamabad next week. If there is no breakthrough, Manmohan Singh and Musharraf could discuss a way out when they meet in New York next month.

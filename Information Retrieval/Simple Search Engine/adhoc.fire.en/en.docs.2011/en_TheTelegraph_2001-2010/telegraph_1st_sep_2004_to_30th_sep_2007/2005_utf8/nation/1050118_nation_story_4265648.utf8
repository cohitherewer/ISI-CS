 LJP leader in net over 2001 case

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya/Jehanabad, Jan. 17: The Lok Janshakti Party today received a pre-poll blow with the arrest of a candidate in Gaya district.

 LJP candidate from Fatehpur Shyamdeo Paswan was arrested on charges of attempt to murder, damage to public property and obstruction caused in the performance of duty by public servants.

 The case was instituted on August 16, 2001 and for more than three years, Paswan, as Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA, roamed freely. The axe fell on him after he joined the LJP headed by Ram Vilas Paswan.

 The Congress too received setbacks as more leaders decided to fight the elections as Independents or candidates of other parties. Congress leader in Gaya Ram Uday Prasad filed his nomination as an Independent candidate while Renuka Palit resigned to fight the elections on a Samajwadi Party ticket from the Gaya Town seat.

 Wind out of BJPs Goa sail

 FREDERICK NORONHA

 Panaji, June 5: The BJP today suffered a jolt in Goa where its defectors handed the Congress-led alliance victory in four of the five bypolls. 

 The Congress, now with a strength of 18 in the 40-member Assembly, is poised to return to power. 

 The bypolls to the five Assembly seats were held on June 2. Taleigao, Margao and Cumbharjua were won by the Congress while ally Nationalist Congress Party got Benaulim. 

 Only one of the party-hopping MLAs, Isidore Fernandes, who switched from the Congress to the BJP and again back to the Congress to cause two byelections in a year, lost his seat by 888 votes at Poinguinim in the states extreme south. The seat went to the BJPs Ramesh Tawadkar.

 The state, which was brought under Presidents rule on March 4 and where the legislature is in suspended animation, has been rocked by repeated political turmoil and frequent change of loyalties by MLAs.

 Among those who ditched the BJP and won today is former deputy chief minister Digambar Kamat. Recontesting from Margao, he won by 1,377 votes, despite a BJP campaign that called for a fitting lesson for his betrayal. His nearest rival was the BJPs Sharmad Raiturkar.

 Francis Xavier Mickky Pacheco, a former flamboyant BJP sports minister, who runs a football club and had a key role in toppling the BJP government, won Benaulim easily on an NCP ticket. 

 Rivalling him in the Catholic-majority area was the United Goans Democratic Party that had already pledged to back the Congress if it won ? an indication of how unpopular the Manohar Parrikar-led government had become among the minorities.

 In Cumbarjua, Pandurang Madkaikar, another former BJP minister, won on a Congress ticket. His presence had upset former Congress president Nirmala Sawant enough to push her to contest as an Independent. 

 Antanasio Babush Monserrate, who was a key aide to Parrikar from 2000 till he switched camp, won Taleigao, defeating the BJPs Pradeep Nagvenkar by 6,228 votes.

 The Congress legislature party will meet tomorrow to decide on its leader amid indications that the race may be limited to Pratapsinh Rane, state Congress chief Ravi Naik and Lusinho Faleiro.

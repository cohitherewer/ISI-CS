 Mumbai, Jan. 16: Mukesh Ambani didn?t turn up.

 The much-awaited encounter between the Ambani brothers did not take place as big brother Mukesh, who was to take part in the Mumbai Marathon with Anil, decided to give the event a miss.

 But Anil proved he is a pro ? on the running tracks, at least. A Reliance spokesperson told reporters that he had run the Half Marathon ? a distance of 21 km ? in a breathless 1 hour 27 minutes and 31 seconds, a two-minute improvement on his timing last year. 

 Mother Kokilaben, who could be the final arbiter in the dispute between the Ambani brothers, was in the stands packed with family members to cheer Anil.

 After the event, Anil said he had run for ?Mumbai, for fitness and for state of mind?. 

 Lanky Kenyan Julius Sugut, who had finished second last year, won the marathon. Sugut, who has a personal best of 2 hours 10 minutes and 33 seconds, finished the 42.2-km loop from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Bandra Reclamation and back in 2 hours 13 minutes and 20 seconds.

 African nations took the other two top honours. Christopher Isegwe of Tanzania finished second, 9 seconds behind Sugut, and Gashaw Malese of Ethiopia was third at 2 hours 13 minutes and 59 seconds.

 The marathon was many things to many people. For the glamour quotient, it was a heady mix of visibility with charity. Give India, the official charity organisation in the event, estimated it had raised more than Rs 2 crore, much of it from companies which sponsor NGOs and celebs.

 A team of do-gooders from Bollywood turned up in strength. Amitabh Bachchan flagged off the senior citizen?s run. With him were Anil?s wife Tina, the person behind Harmony, the NGO that organised the race, Union sports minister Sunil Dutt and Amitabh?s son Abhishek. Javed Jaffrey and Rahul Bose, just back from the Andamans where he was working for tsunami relief, also ran. 

 Sachin Tendulkar was there on behalf of the NGO Apnalaya. He was stopped from taking part in the Dream Run, the abridged marathon of 7 km, as the organisers thought security would be a problem. But he exuded fellow-feeling standing on the dais, even getting down to talk to some blind children who were shouting his name.

 For some, the marathon was an extraordinary feat. For Angad Dev Singh Dugal, it was a superhuman achievement. For the 18-year-old with a brain injury from birth, it was his second year here. 

 He can barely walk. But supported by his mother, he looked straight ahead and lurched forward, taking four or five steps at a time, then collapsing on his legs that can barely support him. 

 As he stumbled and fell again, his sisters and small crowd shouted: ?Come on, big boy, we know you can do it. You can do it.? Angad picked himself up, fell down again and picked himself up. When he reached the finishing line, he had walked for 4.5 km. His personal marathon.

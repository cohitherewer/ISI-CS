Patna, Feb. 19: A cautious Sonia Gandhi today went back even on her initial hint of attack on the Rashtriya Janata Dal government and said if a ?secular? regime comes to power in Bihar, her party would apply ?moral pressure? on it.

 Addressing a lacklustre rally at Gandhi Maidan here, the AICC president made it evident that her criticism of underdevelopment and poor law and order situation, which she made at Buxar and Bhagalpur, had dissipated over two weeks.

 ?Vote for the Congress and its partners,? Sonia said, without specifying who her party?s partners were. The Congress, which is contesting 80 seats, has an alliance with Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, while the RJD has left 12 seats for the Congress? sitting legislators.

 Congress sources said Sonia?s ?soft approach? had come after the RJD requested her not to attack the ruling party as this could hit the prospects of a ?secular? government. ?We were expecting a better crowd at her Patna rally. People are perhaps not interested in elections and politics. Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s meeting yesterday had thin attendance,? a Congress leader said just after the rally.

 State Congress president Ram Jatan Sinha is the party?s nominee from Patna Central seat, pitted against the BJP?s Arun Sinha and Aqil Haider of the Nationalist Congress Party. The BJP had won all three seats in Patna city last time.

 ?Bihar has scaled great heights in the past. Its backwardness and violence of today must end at the earliest. We want to take Bihar on the path of development. It is a question of Bihar?s glory. Only those who are ready to sacrifice, only those who are secular, can bring about the desired change,? Sonia said.

 The AICC president exhorted the elderly to think back to support her contention that only the Congress was responsible for whatever development happened in Bihar. ?Our party and its stalwarts from Bihar have given the state what it has today. The NDA government ignored the country and Bihar and that is why it was defeated. No survey on the NDA?s return proved right during the Lok Sabha elections,? she said.

 Sonia said her party wants an ?effective and secular? government in the state. ?Its priorities should be employment generation, good law and order, investment and economic development. True politics has a close relation with the interest of the people. I have learnt this from my family?s traditions and Bihar will also develop only through this route,? she said.

 Sonia admitted that farmers, workers and weavers were facing ?serious problems?. ?Bihar has several problems. Unless the poor are the target of any government?s work, these cannot be solved.?

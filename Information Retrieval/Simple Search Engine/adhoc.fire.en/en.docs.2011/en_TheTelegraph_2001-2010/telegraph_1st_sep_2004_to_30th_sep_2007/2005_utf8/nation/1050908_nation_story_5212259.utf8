The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bridge misses govt support

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: A bridge connecting the western side of Calcutta to its fast-developing eastern fringes and the airport may remain too far because the Bengal government is behaving as it usually does and not as it is lately promising to.

 Billed as the countrys largest build-operate-transfer (BOT) project, the Second Vivekananda Bridge Tollway will be 6.1 km long with six lanes.

 The length includes 3.5 km of road on the Howrah side, an 880-metre-long bridge on the Hooghly and 1.5 km of road in the Calcutta portion. 

 Holding the Rs 1,000-crore project to ransom is Dunlop interchange, at the crossing of PWD Road and BT Road near the Dunlop rail-bridge.

 The interchange is a key element because traffic coming from the western side of the bridge will need it for smooth passage towards Barrackpore and Shyambazar. 

 Besides, it will enable faster transit to the airport through the 8-km-long Belghoria Expressway. 

 The Dunlop interchange will be very important for faster and congestion-free east-west connectivity, said a source close to the project.

 This part of the project ? the interchange ? is the state governments responsibility. But no work has started on the stretch, though around Rs 61 crore has been sanctioned and though the state has to pay for the delay, said the source. 

 A consortium of engineering consultants and infrastructure developers, including Consulting Engineering Services (CES), Parsons amp; Brinkerhoff, IJM ? Malaysia, Pacific Alliance Group ? USA and L amp;T, is implementing the project after signing a contract with the National Highway Authority of India. 

 According to the terms of the 30-year concession agreement, Second Vivekananda Bridge Tollway Company will complete construction in three years and collect toll for 27 years. The construction started in April 2004. 

 This is a unique project and involves a lot of technical challenges. We have completed around 45 per cent of construction and we are confident about completing it by March 2007, said S.S. Chakraborty, managing director of CES and chairman of the tollway company. 

 He declined to comment on the governments failure to start construction of the interchange, which CES has designed free of cost. 

 Chakrabaorty said: We have had some discussions with the government about it and we expect the government would do its bit for the project. 

 Sources said the project is bound to get delayed by around five to six months as construction of the interchange would require a minimum two years. As delay would result in losses for the consortium, the government would have to pay compensation. Still no action is taken, a source added.

 Emmies come to India

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 10: The Emmies are coming to India.

 It may not mean that Indian television programming has reached international class, but a round of the Emmies, the most prestigious awards for the small screen, will be judged for the first time by an Indian jury.

 The growing Indian television industry has attracted the Emmies, the small screen counterpart of the Oscars, here.

 Tomorrow, in Mumbai, a panel of 21 television personalities will judge the semi-final round of two categories, comedy and non-scripted entertainment (that includes reality and talk shows) of the International Emmies.

 On the panel are industry heavyweights Tarun Katial from Sony, Sunil Lulla from the Times group, Cyrus Oshidar from MTV, producer Nikhil Alva, actor Simone Singh, who presented an Emmy last year and actor and television host Javed Jaffrey.

 They will select two entries for each category out of a total of 26 entries. Anil Wanvari, CEO of Indiantelevision.com and board member of the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, who will host the judging, said three of the programmes that will be judged tomorrow are Indian. The programmes selected will be part of the final nominations.

 Sandy Clark from the International Academy, who will oversee the judging, said the academy thought it would be appropriate that professionals from the very developed film and television industry in India get a chance to choose the best international TV programmes.

 The International Emmies are different from the Emmies, to which only American programmes can be nominated. Clark said there were three academies for Emmies: the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences that gave away the US prime time Emmies, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

 CPM piles arms heat

 New Delhi, April 24: A day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signalled that India was willing to resume military aid to Nepal, the CPM has strongly opposed arms supply to the ?despotic king?, reports our special correspondent.

 The party has asked the UPA government to clarify its stand immediately.

 Terming the move as ?wrong? and an ?unjustified step?, the CPM politburo said King Gyanendra, in his speech at the Asia-Africa summit in Jakarta, strongly defended his authoritarian action. All that he has assured in his talks is that democracy would be restored ?sooner rather than later?. 

 The CPM also dubbed the municipal elections to be held in the Himalayan kingdom as ?farcical?, saying the civic polls cannot be a substitute for the full restoration of parliamentary democracy.

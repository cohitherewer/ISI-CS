 US sniffs a flower child 

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Sept. 4: Sania Mirza is reopening some old, familiar debates about India even as she captivates North Americans with her dizzying climb in tennis of 284 places in one year.

 Why does an Indian woman wear two silver hoops through the middle of her left ear? Is Sanias nose ring a sign of her rebelliousness, something similar to what the flower children of America wore in the 1960s?

 Virtually every newspaper from coast to coast in the US and Canada has printed something about Sania this weekend.

 The sports TV channels are liberally featuring her.

 Their websites have senior writers doing profiles of the Indian tennis sensation. 

 ESPNs senior writer Greg Garber, wrote of Sania: In the context of where she comes from ? the great, roiling, teeming country of India ? Sania Mirza is turning stereotypes inside out. She is making her own kind of radical history.

 Even sophisticated US tennis fans may not know the name, not yet. But in India, where the population is estimated to be 1.08 billion ? roughly one-sixth of the worlds population ? Mirza is Julia Roberts or Gwyneth Paltrow.

 In Globe and Mail, Canadas leading daily, Tom Tebbutt wrote about the unconventional Indian: An independent-minded woman, people have suggested her (Sania) wearing a nose ring is a sign of her being rebellious.

 He then went on to correct that misconception: In fact, nose rings are not uncommon among Indian women.

 Discussions such as this were once very common in North America. Until outsourcing started taking away jobs from America to Bangalore and Gurgaon, stunning America into the realisation that India was changing.

 Sanias apparel and demeanour have rekindled some of those old debates.

 In this, Pakistani Americans are acting as catalysts.

 They have adopted her as one of their own ? fellow South Asian Muslim.

 One Pakistani blogger yesterday reproduced an article about Sania that appeared in The Washington Post. 

 But the blogger changed the papers original headline, which was: With Victory, Mirza Keeps Climbing.

 The blog, instead, carried the headline: Indian Muslim teenager climbing international tennis ranks.

 Which provoked a blistering response from a reader, who posted the comment: This sucks! I wish the blogger had chosen a more appropriate title than an Indian Muslim teenager!

 Bhagirathi alarm rings in SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: Bhagirathi, the upper arm of the Ganga, could disappear underground after causing a major disaster, the Supreme Court was told today.

 Commodore Sureshwar D. Sinha, in a public interest litigation, said the Tehri dam on the Bhagirathi was not performing as expected and much of the water was flowing down into a deep aquifer because of low release for surface flow. 

 If the Bhagirathi descends to the hot lava through the fault in the South Asian Tectonic Plate, close to Tehri, it could set off a chain of reactions ? including severe earthquakes ? that would cause devastation not just in the Terai region but further into the Yamuna basin, possibly having an impact in the national capital.

 The court issued notices to the Centre and the Uttaranchal government to urgently address these issues and asked them to report within six days on the action taken. 

 A three-judge bench told the governments they could initiate action immediately even without taking the leave of the court if urgent steps were necessary.

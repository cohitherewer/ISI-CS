 PM pitch: make peace and prosper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: India today said South Asian nations must end terrorism in the region if their economies were to prosper.

 We must join hands to put our collective house in order. Peace in the region will benefit all. Terrorism anywhere will hurt us all, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told a conference of business leaders from Saarc nations.

 Delhi accuses some of its neighbours of harbouring or actively supporting anti-India elements and the warning came in the wake of the pre-Diwali blasts in the capital that killed over 50 people.

 To imagine that any one of us can pursue what economists call beggar-thy-neighbour policies and thereby prosper is to delude oneself, Singh said. No one can assume that when a neighbour is hurt by terrorism one can somehow remain insulated from the consequences.

 This is the first time Singh has used a business conference to send out a message against terror to Indias neighbours. Security analysts echoed him, saying Bangladesh and Pakistan, countries Delhi has accused of harbouring anti-India insurgents, were themselves victims of separatist movements which could escalate any time.

 Singh today linked his call for an end to terror to investments. No investor will come to this region if there is no assurance of peace and security.

 Both Pakistan and Bangladesh have been trying to woo foreign investment to break out of a debilitating debt-cum-poverty trap and the latter is keen that Indian business, which has been aggressively investing abroad, focuses on it.

 Indias Tata group plans to invest close to $3 billion in gas-based steel and fertiliser plants in Bangladesh, the biggest foreign investment proposal ever made to that country. But Indian policy planners are afraid that without adequate security guarantees, the investment could turn risky.

 Singh also tried to allay fears that a pan-South Asian free trade agreement, which is in the works, could hurt smaller Saarc members. The 20-year-old forum has not yet been able to resolve contradictions between member states. As a result, trade within Saarc accounts for just 5 per cent of the total trade from the region.

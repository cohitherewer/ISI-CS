 Seven-year jail for raping minor

New Delhi (PTI): A court on Saturday sentenced a youth to 

seven years? rigorous imprisonment for raping his eight-year-old neighbour in 

2003.

 Additional sessions judge Mamta Sehgal, observing that the ?offence committed by the convict is very serious and grave in nature?, convicted Bindeshwar.

 Bindeshwar, a resident of an East Kailash slum, had raped the girl on May 10, while her parents were away for work.

 The case was registered against Bindeshwar on the basis of the statement given by the victim?s mother.

 After his arrest, Bindeshwar had stated that he was only 15 years old, and in the absence of any document to prove his age, the case was referred to a juvenile court.

 However, following a court order, a medical examination at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences revealed his age to be 20. The case was then handled by the sessions court.

 Lara Dutta sues magazine

Mumbai (PTI): Former Miss Universe and actor Lara Dutta has 

filed a suit in Bombay High Court against a magazine for allegedly using her photographs 

for the promotion of a forthcoming modelling contest.

 Dutta claimed that the lifestyle and fashion magazine, Gladrags, was using her pictures without permission thereby violating copyright laws.

 Gladrags contended that it had purchased Dutta?s photographs from a photographer who claimed he had the licence to use the photographs in any manner.

 Janak Dwarkadas, counsel for the magazine, said Gladrags used the photographs only after the photographer gave in writing that the pictures could be used for publication.

 The photographer has not been made a party to the suit, Dwarkadas added. ?It is also learnt that there is some agreement between Dutta and the photographer. The said agreement was also not produced before the court,? he said.

 Justice D.G. Karnik on Friday adjourned the matter for hearing on Tuesday and directed the magazine not to use the pictures till then.

 Burton changes spots

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: Dan Burton wants to change his image.

 So the US Congressmans two-page CV lists his achievements, educational qualifications, his family and the names of 20-odd committees he is part of ? but does not say he is also one of the most vocal and best-known members of the Pakistan caucus.

 It wouldnt serve his purpose to mention that because Burton no longer wants to be seen as an India-baiter. After years of putting India in the doghouse on human rights violations in Kashmir and Punjab and for flexing its military muscle against smaller neighbours in South Asia, particularly Pakistan, he wants to be seen as an India-lover.

 I have always been an admirer of India. There is a picture of the Taj Mahal that hangs on my office wall for the past 23 years, he said today.

 He added he was so well-received in India that he has fallen in love with the country and even went to the extent of making one of the reporters feel his head to show that he does not have any horns.

 The Congressman, who in the past had publicly flaunted his pro-Khalistani and Kashmiri sympathies, refused to be drawn into any controversy. He sidestepped questions on whether the Khalistanis were justified in their demand for a separate state with an answer that suggested that things have been dramatically transformed in Pakistan. 

 Indian and Pakistani leaders, he added, should seriously talk about terror and the reports about regrouping of Khalistani activists in Pakistan.

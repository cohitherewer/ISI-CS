 Naxalites kill seven in Andhra

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, March 12: Maoists last night killed seven persons, including four police personnel, in Guntur district, putting the prospects of continuation of peace talks in jeopardy.

 Those killed included circle inspector R. Prasad Rao, three constables and three civilians, including the mother of a police officer.

 Suresh, an area commander of armed dalams in Guntur and Prakasham districts, said the Maoists had lost faith in the peace process, adding that the rebels would not participate in talks anymore. ?We have no confidence in this government, which is functioning contrary to its earlier assurances,? he said in a telephonic interview with a local television channel.

 Forty armed rebels in two Sumos, a jeep and several two-wheelers surrounded the police station at Chilakaluripeta, about 375 km from here, late last night after warning residents of the highway town to stay indoors till they left.

 The Maoists threw grenades and crude bombs into the police complex and shot constables and civilians at point-blank range. Sub-inspector Dharmendra ran out of the rear door. The rebels, however, entered the officer?s house and injured his 60-year-old mother who later died.

 KBC amp; Bachchan sizzle in second coming

 - Record ratings at first show

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Aug. 12: Some things dont change. Like Indias thirst for general knowledge. Or Amitabh Bachchan.

 Kaun Banega Crorepati Part 2 (KBC2), hosted by the actor, has come up with a score that puts to rest all fears that Bachchan is jaded, a bore and that his supply is more than the demand for him. That the new Bachchan, who sheds his classy suit and his reserve and dons a cool leather jacket, would not work. That a sequel does not work in India. 

 The biggest Indian television show, in its second coming on STAR Plus on August 5, has earned a stupendous TVR of 19.75 in the defining CS 4+ (cable and satellite audience in the 4-plus age-group ) Hindi-speaking market. The numbers are one of the highest ever seen on the charts of TAM, the television measurement agency. On the second day, the TVR was 15.05 in the same market.

 Though these are figures only for the opening week, market analysts feel that these are signs that KBC is still the winner that it was.

 The opening TVRs also take KBC beyond the second-biggest Indian show, Sonys Indian Idol, on the day of the finals. The TVR for the opening day of KBC2 across the all-India market was 13.8 (the south always brings it down, though there is a Tamil version now on the STAR-owned Vijay TV, where a mime artiste speaks in Tamil in an Amitabh voice). 

 The TVR for the Indian Idol finals, one of the nations most-watched events, had managed a figure of 11.5 across the all-India market.

 KBC2 has also reclaimed the glory of the first launch.

 On July 3, 2000, when the show was first launched, it increased the share of STAR Plus from 2 per cent four weeks earlier to 25 per cent in the six metros. This year, the KBC launch slot ? Friday 9 pm to 10 pm ? commanded 10 per cent of the share four weeks before the launch in the same markets. It went up to 38 per cent with the first episode.

 The Indian viewer has not changed, either. KBC2 united all India ? rich, poor, men, women, children, upmarket, downmarket, in equal parts ? like KBC the original did.

 Almost as many men watched KBC on Friday as women, and that was so in 2000, too. In the launch episode in 2000, the male-female ratio was 52:48. This time, there was a slight fall in the proportion of men ? the ratio was 51:49.

 The same was true for age groups. Twenty-two per cent of the audience came from the 4-14 age group, while the biggest segment was the 35-plus age-group ? it constituted 36 per cent of the viewers.

 The socio-economic groups were also equally represented, then and now.

 In 2005, the largest segment of viewers came from the most affluent section, with section A, the highest category, making up 27 per cent. Section B contributed 24 per cent and section C 25 per cent. The less privileged sections D and E contributed 24 per cent.

 In 2000, section A made up 23 per cent, section B 22 per cent, section C 25 per cent and sections D and E 29 per cent.

 STAR Plus is happy. Ajay Vidyasagar, director, marketing, STAR Network, brushed away the reservations about Bachchans new look and the dip in the second days TVR. Even 15.05 is a stupendous figure, he said.

 Media planners, too, predict a smooth run. As a programme, KBC2 will go through, said Srinivas Prabhu, senior vice president, Universal McCann.

 If there are snags, the channel and Bachchan will make the necessary changes, he said.

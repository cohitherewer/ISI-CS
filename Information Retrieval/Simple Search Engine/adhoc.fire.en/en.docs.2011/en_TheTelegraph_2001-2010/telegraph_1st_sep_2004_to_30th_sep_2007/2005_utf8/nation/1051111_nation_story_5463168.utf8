 Kidnap cloud on Pak ties

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The peace process may not be derailed yet, but the alleged abduction of the son of a Pakistan high commission official here is threatening to snowball into a diplomatic row.

 Delhi has dismissed Islamabads claims that Roshan Ali, 19, was kidnapped outside his college, smeared with blood, forced to pose with corpses while holding a bloodied knife and then given a handwritten note in Hindi telling him to leave India within five days.

 Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Mohammed Khan raised the issue with his Indian counterpart Shyam Saran on the sidelines of the Saarc summit in Dhaka yesterday and it threatens to cast a shadow over the meeting between Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Shaukat Aziz on Saturday.

 Police... concluded the reported incident was probably a prank, the Indian foreign ministry said, adding that the note had been written at Alis request by one of his friends, who confessed to the police.

 Pakistan has expressed disappointment over Indias response. 

 Delhi feels Islamabad is resorting to such tactics to deflect the mounting pressure it has been facing for failing to stop cross-border terrorism.

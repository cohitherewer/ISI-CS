 OV?s kin fight over last rights

 Vijayan

 New Delhi, April 7 (PTI): Writer and cartoonist .V. Vijayan?s relatives are fighting over the rights to his ashes a week after his death.

 His son Madhu has secured an injunction from Delhi High Court to prevent the Malayalam writer?s nephew, cartoonist Ravishankar, from immersing the ashes. 

 Madhu?s petition accused Ravishankar ? who performed the last rites in Palakkad, Kerala, last week ? of refusing to part with the ashes ?simply in order to draw mileage? since Vijayan was a renowned person.

 ?Much to our shock and anguish and against the will of my mother and me, my cousin S.G. Ravishankar has taken possession of my father?s ashes,? Madhu said in a statement today.

 Ravishankar said he had never denied the rights of Vijayan?s son and widow Teresa, a Christian, to his ashes. They were free to take the ashes on the verbal assurance that these would be immersed in the Ganga, the cartoonist said.

 Ravishankar said he had ?refused? to accept Teresa?s written request for the ashes after ?sensing a commercial interest (in the wake of reports that a publisher was going to preserve the ashes in a memorial)?.

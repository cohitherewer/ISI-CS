 Army fears arms leak

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Indian Army and security establishment is concerned that arms meant for the Royal Nepal Army may end up reaching militant rebels because the ability of Kathmandu?s military to secure supply lines is doubtful.

 With the Maoists calling for a blockade from February 13, protesting the king?s move, the RNA will be severely challenged to secure supply lines. In New Delhi, sources in the security establishment point out that even if equipment is airlifted to Kathmandu, much of it will have to be transported by road to the interiors. 

 India?s suspension of military supplies to the RNA in the wake of the king?s power grab is driven not only by political and diplomatic pressures but also by security compulsions. The Indian security establishment cannot articulate its assessment of the RNA?s military ability because that would impinge on diplomatic relations and on itself. The Indian Army has been the RNA?s strongest prop.

 But, former military officers say there is adequate reason to fear that the rebels can attack supply lines. In the past too the rebels have raided or ambushed the RNA and looted weapons that have not been recovered. Indeed, guns, ammunition and war materiel looted from the army possibly make up a bulk of the Maoists? arsenal.

 Securing supply lines for a military operation in an insurgency situation requires a large number of troops. ?The RNA will have to raise its manpower to at least 1,50,000 before it can be confident of taking on the Maoists,? wrote Major General (retired) Ashok K. Mehta in a journal of the United Services Institution. The RNA currently has about 78,000 troops and is in the middle of an expansion programme.

 During a three-day strike immediately after the king?s proclamation on February 1, the rebels had felled trees and put up obstacles to block highways. Nepalese authorities have since claimed that the highways have been opened.

 The royal army has launched air strikes in Nepal?s western and mid-western regions signalling the renewal of an offensive against the rebels, using Cheetah and Chetak helicopters, supplied by India.

 The RNA chief, General Pyar Jung Thapa, invited the Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, to army headquarters in Kathmandu on Monday. The army chief requested India to continue with its military assistance. Kathmandu is also understood to have pointed out that its procurement of military equipment was based on an agreement that Nepal will source the hardware from any third country only if India fails.

 ?The rebels hold enormous firepower which is spread throughout the countryside. In addition to arms procured in the private market and robbed from households throughout the country, those snatched and looted from government forces comprise about 1,600 .303 rifles and a large number of magnum rifles, pistols, shotguns, sten guns, 7.62 rifles, SLRs, 9-mm SMGs, 7.62 LMGs, rocket launchers, mortar bombs, explosives, a huge quantity of ammunition and other accessories. Only a tiny fraction (about 15 per cent) of the arms looted from the security forces has been recovered so far,? wrote Ram S. Mahat, a former finance minister and foreign minister of Nepal and member of the central committee of the Nepali Congress, in a publication on India-Nepal relations.

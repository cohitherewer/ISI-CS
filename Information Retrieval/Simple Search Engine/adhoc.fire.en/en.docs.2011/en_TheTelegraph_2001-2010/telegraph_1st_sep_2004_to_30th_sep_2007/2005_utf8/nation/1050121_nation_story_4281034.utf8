 Heal fleet in uncharted waters

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA 

 Port Blair, Jan. 20: Voyagers carrying India?s new-found international confidence have returned and are now resting in the Andaman Sea off Port Blair.

 ?We were the ambassadors of national goodwill to a country hit by disaster,? said Commander A.K. Jolly, who led the navy?s relief team to Meulaboh, 100 miles south of Banda Aceh, in Indonesia.

 Some 166,000 people have died in that country in last month?s tsunami, most in the province of Aceh, whose capital is Banda Aceh.

 As part of the Indian government?s rapid response to the devastation in neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Maldives, the INS Nirupak was despatched to Meulaboh where it was anchored for 11 days in a region, only 60 miles north of the epicentre of the December 26 earthquake.

 On the first-of-its-kind international mission, the ship was turned into a hospital ? an operation theatre springing up in the dining hall, blood bank in the gunnery office and surgical wards and intensive care units on mess decks.

 The Nirupak and the INS Khukri, a corvette loaded with relief materials, reached Indonesia and the medical camp was set up by January 6. 

 ?We supported the Meulaboh hospital, where of the 120 nurses, most were either dead, missing or unable to serve. Only six were left,? said Surgeon Commander G. Vishwanath.

 In 12 hours flat, the Nirupak, a survey ship from Visakhapatnam, was transformed into a fully-equipped 40-bed hospital as the navy was whipped into action by a decision in Delhi that even in its own suffering, India will venture out to soothe the pain of others.

 Much the same story was played out in Sri Lanka, but on a much larger scale with a number of ships and dozens of helicopters and aircraft taking part in rescue and relief. On December 26 itself, Indian troops were on the island.

 The Indonesian operation might have been smaller, but it represented Delhi?s willingness to set sail beyond the confines of the immediate neighbourhood of south Asia. 

 ?We managed to pool resources with the local authorities and delivered the goods,? Jolly said. 

 Some 1,750 patients were treated by Indian doctors, using the equipment aboard the Nirupak. Three medical officers and 17 sailors formed the team with Jolly at the head and Vishwanath was brought on board, anticipating the need to perform surgeries.

 Apart from working at the local hospital, an outpatient clinic was set up, where a small operation theatre was at hand to deal with minor procedures. The blood-transfusion apparatus on board the Nirupak was set up on shore at the hospital, where most surgeries were performed.

 Two cases had to be airlifted to the ship ? a seven-year-old girl with deep wounds in her leg and foot and a woman who had to undergo an amputation below the knee.

 Unattended even after around 10 days of the disaster and exposed to the elements, most of the injuries had worsened. ?Serious cases had already been evacuated,? said Vishwanath.

 The ship was reserved as a spillover hospital because of the logistical constraint of transporting patients and families by air. With the emergency relief operation over and the second phase of rehabilitation starting in Indonesia, it was time to sail back home. 

 ?The point that India was also hit but, despite that, came to the aid of another country was not lost,? said Jolly.

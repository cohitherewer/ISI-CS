 Long wait for Indira in-law

 Pune, Sept. 29 (PTI): After three decades of running from pillar to post, Shernaz Gandhi, the sister-in-law of the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, is hoping to get her long overdue pension with a government official contacting her today.

 Shernaz, 86, is the widow of Feroz Gandhis elder brother, Dorab, who worked as an agricultural scientist with the Uttar Pradesh government. He died in 1976. She had been living on the munificence of her Mumbai-based niece for some time.

 The octogenarian, who had little hope of getting the pension but refused offers of help pouring in from different quarters, seemed happy today. Some government official had come to meet me today and took details, said an elated Shernaz,.

 Dr Naveen Raina of Satyanand Research Institute, where Shernaz is recuperating from a hip-bone operation, said a government official had come to meet her at the hospital.

 The official refused to reveal his identity but just said that he had to collect details about her and has been asked to send a report to Delhi by this evening, Raina said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rush to court under fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 9: Most UPA parties feel the Supreme Court order advancing the Jharkhand floor test and staying the nomination of an Anglo-Indian member amounts to interference by the judiciary into the legislature?s functions.

 The Left reacted sharply, with a CPI leader saying ?the Supreme Court thinks that it can give a verdict on everything?. CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said ?since the Supreme Court has given a verdict, it has to be obeyed?.

 The CPM joined the Opposition NDA in the Lok Sabha in demanding that recent controversial decisions of the Jharkhand and Goa governors be scrutinised by Parliament so that ?distortions? in their functioning could be checked.

 In the Rajya Sabha, the CPM demanded a full-scale discussion on the institution of the governor in the light of the Jharkhand and Goa developments. It said a constitutional amendment should be taken up if required.

 But CPM leader Nilotpal Basu made it clear that ?ideologically the UPA coalition with its outside supporters is more cemented than the previous alliance?.

 Observing that the political drama of the past few weeks was a lesson for the government as well as the Opposition, Basu said no party or political front could claim to have received people?s confidence in Bihar and Jharkhand and this left scope for interpretation.

 Slamming the BJP for taking the Jharkhand governor issue to court, he said issues relating to legislatures should be decided in the House. Else the death knell of parliamentary institutions would be sounded, Basu added.

 The Congress proceeded cautiously on the Supreme Court step-in, saying it has always respected the verdict of the apex court. But spokesman Anand Sharma questioned the BJP?s decision to approach the court with matters that could have been debated in Parliament.

 Asked about the BJP?s claim that the ruling was a defeat for party president Sonia Gandhi, Sharma asked: ?How does Sonia Gandhi come into the picture? She has neither intervened nor issued any direction in the matter.?

 On the court?s directive not to nominate an Anglo-Indian member before the floor test, Sharma said the BJP, during its 13-day rule at the Centre and short-lived regime in Bihar headed by Nitish Kumar, had gone in for such nominations.

 Asked if certain specific provisions in the Constitution should be reviewed in the wake of the deadlock over government formation, he said a broad consensus needed to be thrashed out in Parliament based on earlier discussions and debates.

 The Rashtriya Janata Dal expressed surprise on the stay on nomination of an Anglo-Indian representative, saying it had been the practice so far which both the BJP and Janata Dal (United) had followed.

 Tragedy shadow on change of guard

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: Politics has taken a backseat in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of the quake tragedy.

 Indications are that the Congress central leadership may not insist on installing a party chief minister in the state in place of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.

 His three-year term in office comes to an end on November 2, according to the power-sharing agreement reached between the Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). 

 At the moment, the only priority for the Congress, both at the central and state levels, is relief and rehabilitation. The tragedy is so overwhelming that nobody in Kashmir is even entertaining political questions, a Congress leader said today. 

 Sources said nobody, either from the partys state unit or from the PDP, raised the power transfer question during Sonia Gandhis day-long visit to Jammu and Kashmir yesterday. Nor did Sonia mention the issue when she met Mufti in Srinagar, the sources said. 

 Last Tuesday, Sonia is believed to have told Mufti during a meeting at her 10 Janpath residence that because of political compulsions, she would have to implement the power-sharing agreement and appoint a Congress chief minister early November.

 The central leadership was under pressure from the state Congress which felt that the party must not shy away from leading the coalition ministry. 

 The same day, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is understood to have offered a cabinet berth to Mufti, which the chief minister apparently declined.

 A month earlier, Sonia as well as the Prime Minister are learnt to have had conveyed to Mufti that the Congress would allow the status quo to continue.

 The party leadership is believed to have then sounded Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad last week, asking him to be ready to assume the top post in Srinagar. 

 However, in the wake of Saturdays disaster, Sonia rushed Azad to the state on a different assignment.

 Azad has been camping in the state, coordinating the relief and rehabilitation efforts on behalf of the central government.

 Speculation was rife in Delhi that the Srinagar power transfer may be deferred by two months.

 But a Congress leader said: We will not even entertain such political questions as long as we are involved in relief and rehabilitation work. It will take a lot of time since the areas hit are in remote and mountainous parts.

 Under instructions from Sonia, the AICCs relief and rehabilitation committee met at the party headquarters this evening to chalk out a plan to offer assistance.

 The partys frontal organisations have been asked to send activists to the state immediately. Congress-ruled states like Assam and Haryana, too, have offered help.

 Modi MLA in riot net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Nov. 5: An MLA close to Narendra Modi has been remanded in police custody for the post-Godhra riots by a court that had a day earlier granted him anticipatory bail.

 Shankar Chaudhary, accused of gunning down two Muslim youths in his constituency of Radhanpur in north Gujarats Banaskantha district, had got anticipatory bail on Thursday from the court.

 For reasons yet unexplained, yesterday he presented himself before the same Radhanpur court, where police demanded two days remand to collect further evidence against him. The court granted the remand.

 Political observers suspect that something fishy might be going on. The police had earlier given him a clean chit before being forced to reopen the case under Supreme Court orders.

 Chaudhary has been accused of leading a mob of rioters on March 1, 2002, and shooting Ghulam Nabi Sheikh and Ghulam Rasool Sheikh dead with his personal gun. There are nine other accused in the case, lodged by five local Muslims.

 But the police came to the MLAs aid. They claimed that policemen sent to quell the rioting had fired on the battling mobs, and it was these police bullets that had killed Nabi and Rasool.

 The post-mortem reports confirmed death because of bullet wounds, but it was never established whether the bullets had been fired from a police rifle or a private weapon. The police closed the case.

 But the Supreme court ordered fresh probe of several riot cases, and this was one of them. The deputy inspector-general of police who carried out the re-investigation nailed Chaudhary. The officer was soon transferred, but the MLA was forced to seek anticipatory bail.

 During the re-investigation, the police had sought to exhume the bodies of the two victims to find out what kind of bullets had killed them. But the victims relatives refused to allow the bodies to be dug up.

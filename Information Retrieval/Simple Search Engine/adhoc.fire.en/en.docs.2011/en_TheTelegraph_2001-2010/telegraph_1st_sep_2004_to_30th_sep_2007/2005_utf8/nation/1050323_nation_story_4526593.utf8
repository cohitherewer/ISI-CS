 Probe into police ?attack?

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 22: Stung by protests over alleged police assault on two television journalists, the Naveen Patnaik government today ordered inquiries by the CID and a district magistrate into the incident.

 K.C. Nayak, officer-in-charge of Lingaraj police station here, allegedly assaulted two journalists of a local TV channel yesterday when they had gone to speak to him for a traffic story. 

 The police officer was accused of assaulting reporter Alok Mohanty and cameraperson Bhabani Mallik without any provocation.

 Journalists from Bhubaneswar and Cuttack today staged a dharna in front of the Assembly here and marched to the state police headquarters.

 The chief minister first announced a CID (crime branch) probe by an officer of the rank of superintendent of police and followed it up with an inquiry by the Khurda district magistrate. 

 The inquiries against Nayak, who was transferred to the district police headquarters today, would take about a couple of weeks.

 While the police initially lodged a case against Nayak under Sections 506, 294, 323 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code,it was later toned down as Section 506 (threatening with firearms) was struck off from the FIR. 

 Following protests by the Congress, Patnaik assured the Assembly that the government would take stringent action against Nayak.

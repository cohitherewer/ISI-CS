 Guwahati, March 22: The security establishment in the Northeast today came under the scanner with a large quantity of ammunition possibly stolen from defence arsenals being seized from the New Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express during a routine check at Guwahati railway station.

 Police suspect the ammunition ? packed in five unclaimed suitcases ? were stolen by security personnel and was probably being taken to prospective buyers, including militant outfits. An army official said the consignment may have been meant for the banned Ulfa?s ?mobile units?, which are supposedly preparing for a series of strikes in the capital on the outfit?s raising day on April 7.

 Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel found 5,012 live bullets while customarily checking the coaches of the train. The suitcases were found in coach number eight of the train. 

 The GRP did not detain the train at the station and search for the people who may have been accompanying the consignment. 

 The train, originating in Dibrugarh, had arrived at Guwahati railway station at 6.15 am, which was 15 minutes later than scheduled. It left the station at 7.15 am.

 GRP superintendent Jiban Chandra Koch confirmed that the ammunition was meant for use by defence forces. The consignment was manufactured at Kirki Ordinance Factory in Pune. 

 ?The factory seal leads us to believe that the ammunition was stolen by security personnel from defence units in the region and may have been meant for militant outfits or gangs of criminals,? Koch said.

 The police have intimated the army and paramilitary forces stationed in the region to conduct their own independent inquiries to find out whether there has been any pilferage from their arsenals.

 Koch said the suitcases may have been put on the train when it stopped at Dimapur railway station. Reinforcing the suspicion is the fact that coach number eight of the Rajdhani Express is reserved for passengers boarding the train in Dimapur, which is also the headquarters of the army?s 3 Corps and has an Assam Rifles Training Centre. 

 The suitcases were kept under seat numbers 4, 10 and 64. The occupants of the seats and the other passengers denied that the suitcases belonged to them. They also denied noticing anybody bringing the suitcases inside the coach.

 Of the 5,012 bullets inside the five suitcases, 3,255 rounds were for self-loading rifles, 1,694 for 303 rifles and 60 for light machine guns. Maj. H.D. Thakyal, who rushed to Guwahati railway station on being informed of the ammunition haul, said the army had got wind of Ulfa?s plan to strike in New Delhi on or before its raising day.

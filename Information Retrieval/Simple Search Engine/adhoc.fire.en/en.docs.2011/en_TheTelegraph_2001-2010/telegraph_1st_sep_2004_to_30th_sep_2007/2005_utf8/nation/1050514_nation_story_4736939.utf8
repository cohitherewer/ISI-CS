 Patna, May 13: Former chief minister Rabri Devis MP brothers, Sadhu Yadav and Subhash Yadav, today worked hard to keep their promise to vacate the official bungalows they have been occupying for years. Till late evening, carts loaded with household goods kept trickling out of the two campuses.

 The district administration expects to take formal possession of the two mansions by late tonight or early tomorrow and the magistrates executing the eviction drive are understood to have received instructions to speed up the act.

 Guards at the two houses had been reluctant to let the administration team enter the premises yesterday. Later, the instructions of the two brothers ? that they would vacate the houses by 10 am today ? were passed on to the officials.

 Today, no official was present at either of the bungalows at the slated time. Media teams, too, returned as the gates were firmly closed. A handful of news photographers kept waiting at the entrance of Sadhus house.

 We were summoned by the MP after some time. He told us that enough drama had been highlighted yesterday and there was no need for any more. We were asked not to take photographs, a photo-journalist said.

 The scene was slightly better at the residence of Subhash Yadav where camerapersons were allowed to take photographs. Subhash and his wife were personally supervising the winding-up work, the photographer added.

 The two brothers were informed of the administrations action yesterday after which they returned to the state capital from Delhi. 

 Union ministers Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav and Akhilesh Singh have also vacated their houses.

 A reluctant administration tried to act tough with the two brothers after Governor Buta Singh personally intervened in the matter a few days ago and said anyone in unauthorised occupation of government bungalows would have to vacate at the earliest.

 About two dozen policemen had accompanied the administration team yesterday but today they were not to be seen. Local papers prominently reported yesterdays events and some said the police had entered the two houses.

 The action against the two MPs was the talk of the town today. 

 Now, it seems that something is happening under Presidents rule. Similar promptness should guide all actions of the state administration. The spectre of fear is still not history. It will take some more time, said a shopkeeper on Fraser Road.

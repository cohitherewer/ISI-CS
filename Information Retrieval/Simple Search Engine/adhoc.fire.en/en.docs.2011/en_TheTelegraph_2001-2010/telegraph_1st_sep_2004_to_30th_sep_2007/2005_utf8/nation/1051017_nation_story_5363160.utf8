 Patna, Oct. 16: Eight-year-old Gaurav Kumar alias Golu returned home today, a day before the deadline for his rescue set by Patna High Court expired.

 Deputy inspector-general (central range) Ram Pravesh Singh said Golu was found near the Railway Protection Force (RPF) post at Hajipur, around 25 km from here, around 6 am today.

 The court set one deadline after another, for the recovery and production of Golu, but police had nothing to show on each occasion. October 17 was the fourth deadline.

 The boy was put on a train near Varanasi and he reached Hajipur safe and sound, Singh said, claiming that the eight-year-old student of DAV School was released under sustained police pressure and that no ransom was paid. 

 The boy, however, told police ? in Hajipur as well as Patna ? that he was not released and had to escape from the clutches of his captors. 

 I fled at night from somewhere in Varanasi and caught the train. I got down at Hajipur this morning, he claimed.

 Golu was kidnapped on September 20 while he was returning home from school. 

 The boy reached Hajipur by Pavan Express and was spotted by RPF constable Rajendra Singh Kushwaha. I approached the boy and recognised him and he gave me his residence telephone number. I then asked his father Anil Singh to come to Hajipur, he recalled. 

 They (the captors) fed me and treated me well, but kept demanding money for my release, Kushwaha quoted the boy as saying.

 The railway police handed over Golu to their Patna counterparts, who kept the boy and his parents behind closed doors for hours. 

 When they came out to face the media after a long wait, the police officers treaded with caution. The rescue was possible due to the intense police pressure. Our concern for the boys safety and his transfer from one gang to the other to escape the police net caused the delay, inspector-general Amrik Singh Nimbran said.

 Police claimed that from the hands of the Pintu Singh gang of Arrah, the boy was taken to Guddu Rai via Buxar. He was eventually kept somewhere near Varanasi.

 The coordinated police action and intense raids in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh led to the arrest of several criminals. We had recently intensified our operations. Our hard work and commitment forced the criminals to release the boy, claimed senior superintendent of police Kundan Krishnan. 

 Doubts over ransom and the role of a BJP legislator of Uttar Pradesh remained even as Nimbran declined comment on the role of any political leader. One of the gangs involved in the episode allegedly enjoyed the MLAs patronage.

 As the day progressed, the drama shifted to Siasaran Sadan in Danapur, where Golu stays with his family. 

 On his return home, the boy stayed indoors.

 The kid will be exposed to the media only after he is produced in the high court tomorrow and after the proceedings are over, said Danapur deputy superintendent of police Dilnawaz Ahmad.

 Relieved at the boys return, a family member said: We are grateful to god and the police...our prayers have been heard. The media too did its job by highlighting the case. We are very happy today.

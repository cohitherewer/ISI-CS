 Cong job drive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: Sonia Gandhi will be the face of a Congress campaign centred on the rural employment guarantee legislation, with eyes focused on reaping political dividends for the party.

 The party dropped hints today as the outgoing working committee met here this evening to put Sonias and the partys imprint on the national rural employment guarantee bill, which has been cleared by Parliament with the Rajya Sabha endorsing it earlier this week.

 The party leadership believes that the law, which provides for the first time a legal right of employment for at least 100 days to an estimated 15 crore rural households (out of a total of 21 crore in the country), has potential to make a difference to life in rural India.

 The Congress can, therefore, use the law to galvanise itself in rural India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where it is out of power.

 And Sonia will be the face to publicise the partys commitment to rural empowerment. While a resolution adopted at the working committee meeting spoke of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs rock-solid backing for the legislation, it gave the entire credit to the Congress chief.

 Sonia Gandhi... first conceptualised this idea (of job guarantee) and thereafter (she) converted the idea into the shape of a draft bill. Using her persuasive skills, she contributed in ironing out the differences between various constituents, the resolution stated and described her as the real spirit behind the legislation.

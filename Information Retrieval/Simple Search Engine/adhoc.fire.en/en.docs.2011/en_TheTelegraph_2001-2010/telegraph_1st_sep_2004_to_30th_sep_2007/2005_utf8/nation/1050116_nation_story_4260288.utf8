 Jaya draws up tsunami bills for Delhi

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Chennai, Jan. 15: The Tamil Nadu government has decided to accept help from voluntary and non-government organisations in rebuilding efforts and has asked the Centre for a Rs 1,720-crore rehabilitation package for fishermen, whose lives have been torn apart by the tsunami.

 Chief minister Jayalalithaa had a 45-minute meeting with Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar at the secretariat today. She informed him that the government has issued orders to let NGOs participate in a massive permanent housing programme for fishermen, in a ?public-private partnership effort?, which would require at least Rs 800 crore. 

 Although the meeting focused on the housing programme, other issues like coastal agriculture lands being affected by salinity due to seawater seepage were also discussed. Union minister for shipping and road transport T.R. Baalu, the DMK?s nominee to the central cabinet, was also present at the meeting.

 Jayalalithaa told Pawar that the Rs 800-crore permanent housing project would include Rs 100 crore for purchasing land and another Rs 100 crore for providing basic infrastructure in the new colonies.

 Fishermen would be relocated to sites acquired by the state about 1 km away from the sea, the chief minister said, adding that the Centre should finance the purchase of plots as the participation of NGOs would not be enough for such a mammoth project.

 A total of 42,128 traditional fishing equipment and mechanised boats, which have been completely destroyed by the December 26 killer waves, will have to be replaced. Jayalalithaa said this part of the package ?should be fully funded by the Government of India?. 

 The cost of new boats, outboard motors for catamarans and nets would amount to Rs 804.71 crore, the agriculture minister was told. Besides, some boats and outboard motors would have to be repaired.

 The chief minister also urged the Centre to allocate Rs 100 crore for complete repair, dredging and modernisation of fishing harbours and sought an additional Rs 15.60 crore to dredge the heavily silted 52 river mouths so that fish breeding and movement of boats could be restored.

 Jayalalithaa pointed out to Pawar that the agriculture lands in coastal areas, which have been affected by salinity, has impacted about 1.20 lakh families. A rehabilitation package for each of these families, including a monthly rice ration of 30 kg per family and cash support, is required for a period of two years before which the ?soil cannot be reclaimed?, she said.

 Jayalalithaa urged the Centre to also fund a separate package for ?reclaiming the soil? by leaching and application of gypsum. Another proposal for restoration of the salt pans devastated by the tsunami would be sent to Delhi, she added. 

 Pawar gave the chief minister a patient hearing and told reporters that the Centre did recognise that the tsunami-hit areas face an ?abnormal situation?. Considering the magnitude of the devastation, the Centre is considering relaxation of norms of assistance to the state under the National Calamity Relief Fund, the minister added.

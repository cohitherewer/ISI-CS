 Uma threatens war as axe dangles

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Raisen (Madhya Pradesh), Dec. 

 4: Uma Bharti was today back at her blistering best, 

 threatening to unleash a virtual Mahabharata in the Sangh 

 parivar if she is thrown out of the BJP.

 Taunting the Big Two at a meeting 60 km from Bhopal, she said L.K. Advani and A.B. Vajpayee should stop behaving as though they had been hijacked by a group of terrorist leaders devoid of ideology. She also dared them to form a new BJP.

 Quoting Jan Sangh founder Deendayal Upadhyaya, she said that like a crop of carrot, a new Jan Sangh would have to be formed if the erstwhile party became corrupt.

 Now the onus lies on these leaders to ensure that a healthy and ideology-based system is evolved in the BJP and that it is freed from the clutches of people devoid of ideology and principles.

 The blistering attack comes a day ahead of the BJP parliamentary party meeting in Delhi to decide Umas future. There were whispers that she would be expelled from primary membership of the party.

 Claiming she had replied to the showcause notice ?BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar denied receiving it ? Uma said Advani and Vajpayee had paid the price for neglecting legacy of Lord Ram.

 Instead of deriving strength by paying respects at the feet of Ram in Ayodhya, Advani had offered flowers at Mohammad Ali Jinnahs tomb, she said.

 Had Vajpayee not reposed faith in Pakistan during his Lahore visit, the Kargil conflict and the Agra summit setback would not have happened, she claimed.

 Pakistan can betray us, not Ram, she said.

 Oblivious of Umas fireworks, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan today inducted 29 ministers in his team, including predecessor Babulal Gaur. Nineteen ministers of cabinet rank and 10 ministers of state were sworn in.

 Uma kept mocking the BJP leadership over and over again for forgetting Lord Ram in the dash for power.

 This was against our ethos and traditions. If someone dies what will we say? NDA, instead of Ram naam satya hai? she asked to huge applause.

 Reading out a two-page letter addressed to Advani, Uma said she had not slept a wink last night. I tore off reams of paper before finalising a response, she said, terming the reply as an affidavit of my life.

 Uma said that for her the BJP was not a group of persons but a thought process. Today, however, a group of thoughtless people have positioned themselves in important decision-making places. And they are terming their personal interests discipline.

 The issue was not Chauhan, Pramod Mahajan or Arun Jaitley, she said. It is the silence of Atalji and Advaniji. They have been held hostage by a group of leaders whom I consider terrorist hijackers.

 I will wait for both leaders to reply and correct the flaws within the party during my march to Ayodhya. If I get no response, I will decide my future course of action at the feet of Lord Ram and declare it in Delhi. 

 She said she had furnished a proof of her innocence and of the indiscipline of leaders on the BJP parliamentary board.

 Uma urged Ayodhya sants affiliated to the VHP to reason before discouraging her from visiting the Ram temple. I am a born Hindu. I have never used the name of Ram to realise political goals. I derive strength from him, she said.

 She also took a swipe at Chauhan, saying she felt like a mother whose child (the Madhya Pradesh government) had been taken away by a gang of child snatchers and given to a barren woman.

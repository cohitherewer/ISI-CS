 New Delhi, March 1: Finally, it needed a prod from the court.

 Delhi High Court today directed former Union minister Vinod Khanna to vacate by March 15 the ministerial bungalow allotted to him by the previous National Democratic Alliance government.

 After the BJP-led alliance was swept out of power last year, Khanna had been issued several notices to vacate the bungalow on 4, Circular Road by the directorate of estates along with his former colleagues like Kanshiram Rana, Ved Prakash Goel, Ramesh Bais, Ananth Kumar and Jagmohan.

 The matter went to court after Khanna ignored the repeated reminders. Today, an order directing the BJP MP from Gurdaspur to vacate the bungalow was passed by Justice Manmohan Sarin. An undertaking has been given on Khanna?s behalf that he would vacate the premises on or before March 15.

 Khanna?s aide Arun Malhotra said the Bollywood actor had not vacated the premises as he had been asking for alternative accommodation for the last six months. ?He was allotted 8, Purana Quila Road as his house. But that house was in very bad condition. The floor was broken, tiles were coming out and lot of repairs needed to be done. He couldn?t have moved in immediately and he had asked for time from the court,? Malhotra said. ?He has already moved his belongings to the new house, which will be ready in another 10-12 days.?

 Malhotra added that the former Union minister would stick to his undertaking.

 Getting out-of-office ministers to leave their official accommodation can be tough. Former Union minister for urban development and New Delhi MP Jagmohan, who issued eviction notices to several overstaying ministers, was tenacious when it came to retaining his house at 61, Lodhi Estate. Even a letter to Union urban development minister Ghulam Nabi Azad did not stop his request from being turned down by the cabinet committee on accommodations, which takes these decisions.

 At times, allotments can also take a nasty turn.

 Delhi police had to be called when Union minister of state for labour Sis Ram Ola decided to take over the bungalow at 1, Sunehari Bagh, originally allotted to the deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Charanjit Singh Atwal.

 The bungalow ? with its first-class trappings thanks to its former allottee and MP, Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje ? was a coveted one.

 Indian killed in US 

 Birmingham (US), May 31 (AP): A 44-year-old car dealer of Indian origin has been robbed and beaten to death here.

 Kavinderpal Banga, who was found unconscious last Wednesday at Banga Auto Sales in Birmingham suburbs Pinson Valley parking lot, died on Friday night. Banga is survived by his wife and two sons aged four years and five months.

 Five teenagers from Birmingham were arrested and charged with capital murder on Saturday. 

 Three of the suspects are 17-year-old boys, one a girl of that age and the fifth a boy of 15, police said. 

 Four of the suspects were arrested on Thursday while one surrendered on Friday.

 The police had also recovered two vehicles that had been stolen from the parking lot.

 Bangas sister, Manpreet Manda, said a customer had found an injured Banga and called the police. The police used phone numbers listed on his cellphone to locate a friend who helped them contact the car dealers wife.

 Manda said her brother, a US citizen who had lived in Birmingham for 10 years, never regained consciousness. The family decided on Friday to have him taken off the life-support system.

 How do you tell a four-year-old that his daddy wont be coming home? asked Manda, a resident of London who arrived here on Friday to be with her sister-in-law, Karamjit.

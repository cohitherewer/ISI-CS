 Parveen relatives asked for proof

 Ahmedabad (PTI): A court on Wednesday asked all those claiming to be relatives of the late actor Parveen Babi to provide adequate proof by July 1 in connection with her will.

 The order was issued by Junagadhs senior sub-divisional magistrate H.L. Pandya.

 On April 28, Murad Khan Babi, a cousin of the late actor, produced a will, purportedly made by her, in court, which gave him the administrative rights over all her properties.

 Khan had also submitted a copy of the will to a court in Mumbai as her plush Juhu flat was sealed by police since the real benefactor was yet to be decided.

 Parveen Babi, who died on January 22 in Mumbai, has reportedly mentioned in the will that a trust should be formed in her name, which would function for the benefit of needy persons of the Babi clan.

 Khan has also been asked to purchase from the government the Dhanbad Haveli in which Parveen Babi had grown up in Junagadh. The haveli is to be converted into a memorial for her mother and will be named Jamal Bhakte Wadi.

 Six other claimants had said the will was fake.

 The will was prepared by Parveen Babi on July 29, 2002, in Mumbai, Khan said, adding that he had exercised no role in the contents of the will.

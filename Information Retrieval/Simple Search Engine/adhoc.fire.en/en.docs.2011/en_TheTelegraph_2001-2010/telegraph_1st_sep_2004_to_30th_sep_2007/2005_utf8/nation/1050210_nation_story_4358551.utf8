 Pranab terms for US deal

 Bangalore, Feb. 9: The US can get a slice of the Indian military market only if it eliminates the prospect of sanctions over Delhi?s nuclear policy and ensures uninterrupted supply of technology and spares, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.

 ?I am happy that the US has shown interest in our defence market. But because of the US laws, the administration is compelled to impose sanctions. Once the sanctions are imposed, no defence cooperation is possible,? the minister told a news conference after inaugurating Aero India 2005, an international air show.

 ?We are also interested in transfer of technology. Dependability as a source of supply and technology transfer are the two most important criteria for defence cooperation,? he added.

 Mukherjee was answering questions on America?s offer to sell a slew of military aircraft, including the P-3 C Orion (maritime surveillance and anti-submarine aircraft) and the E-2C Hawkeye (naval surveillance aircraft). The Indian Air Force has sent a request to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company for information on F-16 fighter jets before expanding its fleet.

 On India?s nuclear policy, the minister said the doctrine is clear: no first use of nuclear weapons and they would not be deployed against a non-nuclear state. 

 The US administration could make an exception to its rules, he said. ?No position is irreconcilable. We have seen in the past how the law has been amended with one-time waivers to accommodate certain commitments to one country,? Mukherjee said, referring to the scrapping of the Pressler Amendment, according to which the US had stopped military supplies to Pakistan.

 India is continuing negotiations with the US to find a common ground so that it can buy military supplies without fear of sanctions, he said. ?With the possibility of sanctions, your credibility as a supplier is in question.?

 The US had imposed sanctions against India after the 1998 nuclear tests in Pokhran and banned sale of military technology. However, since they were removed in several stages from 2001, the two countries have been working towards closer defence links.

 At another news conference, Dennys Plessas, the regional vice-president of Lockheed Martin, said the perceived mistrust ?is something that belongs to the past. I see a new page, I see a new relationship, I see a relationship based on mutual respect and trust. There are common values that are shared between the two countries. These are the two of the largest democracies in the world. There are very strong ties. We ought to be looking at those strong ties and mutual respect and confidence for the future?.

 Lockheed Martin and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd have signed a technical assistance agreement related to the P-3 C Orion aircraft. The pact has been approved by the US department of state and allows the two companies to share export-controlled technical data related to the aircraft?s design, manufacture and overhaul. 

 Underlining the ?strong and deep relation? between industries of the two countries, Plessas said: ?We are willing, we have the desire to work together in addressing mutual interests? Lockheed Martin will be delighted to work in India and satisfy India?s military requirement.?

 At the inauguration of the show, Mukherjee invited aerospace companies to leverage India?s low-cost and high-talent workforce and infrastructure for building aircraft and systems for the world market.

 84 riot cases registered 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: The CBI has re-registered two cases against unknown persons in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

 The cases pertain to the 10 against sitting MPs Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar and Delhis local Congress leader Dharam Das Shastri that the home ministry referred to the CBI at October-end.

 Finding credible evidence against the trio, the Nanavati report, made public on August 8, had recommended further probe.

 The cases based on FIR nos. 250/84 and 178/84 from Sultanpuri and Mangolpuri police stations have been registered against unknown persons for arson, looting and rioting. 

 But further inquiries could lead to one of the three politicians. The police stations fall in Outer Delhi, Kumars Lok Sabha seat in 1984.

 According to the Nanavati report, FIR no. 178 was recorded on November 15, 1984, but no one was arrested in this case and the case was filed as untraced. However, several incidents pertaining to this FIR, in which affidavits were also filed, directly indict Kumar.

 CBI sources said one case relates to an FIR filed at Mangolpuri police station in which one Iqbal Singh left for his shop on November 1, 1984, and never came back. The Nanavati report also mentions it.

 Affidavit filed by one Kher Singh before Jain-Banerjee Committee stated that on that day in the morning he had seen local MP Sajjan Kumar addressing a crowd of persons and telling them that Sikhs had killed their maata (mother) and that no Sikh in the area should be spared.

 About FIR no. 250, the Nanavati report said that in spite of several incidents taking place in Sultanpuri on November 1, 1984, only one FIR was recorded. During investigations, murders of 137 persons were included.

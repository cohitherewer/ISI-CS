 Gutka ban on Centre plate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Centre would like to ban sales of gutka across the country but finds it is easier said than done, especially after the Supreme Court in November lifted on technical grounds the ban imposed by some states.

 Several state governments had banned gutka, arguing that it damaged health. However, the gutka lobby challenged the states and said it was unfair that the sale of the product was banned in some states and not in others.

 The apex court ruled that only the Centre ? and not state governments ? could take the decision to stop the sale of gutka under section 7(4) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. Gutka is taken orally and is, therefore, technically regarded as a food product.

 After the Supreme Court verdict, the health ministry had asked the law ministry to come up with a suggestion on how a ban on gutka could be imposed without leaving any loopholes for a challenge in the Supreme Court. The law ministry is yet to come up with its suggestions.

 The health ministry has now asked the Indian Council of Medical Research to conduct a study on the hazards of gutka consumption.

 ?Unless we can prove that gutka is harmful to health and back it with solid scientific evidence, the case can be dismissed by the courts on the ground that a drastic step like stopping sales cannot be taken without sufficient proof,? said a senior official of the ministry.

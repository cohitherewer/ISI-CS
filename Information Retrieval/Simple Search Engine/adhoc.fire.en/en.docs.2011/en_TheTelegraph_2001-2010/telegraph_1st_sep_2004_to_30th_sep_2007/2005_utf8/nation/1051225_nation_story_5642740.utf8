 Karat: Buddha model wanted

 New Delhi, Dec. 24: Two months after publicly declaring himself a moderate, Prakash Karat has now virtually told his comrades in Kerala to follow Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal model of development.

 At an international conference on Kerala studies at Thiruvananthapuram this month, the CPM general secretary told party leaders to try and attract private and foreign investment to the state.

 Serious efforts must be made to attract fresh investment. Much of this will be in the private sector. Foreign capital in high technology areas can be solicited, the CPM boss said in a paper presented to the delegates.

 Karat drew a gloomy picture of Kerala, citing the slide in its vaunted social sectors and the rut in which its economy resides.

 The crises in the spheres of employment and material production are among the most pressing economic problems in Kerala. The situation is unsustainable, he said.

 Bengal and Kerala, the two red fortresses in the country, have suffered for decades because of rampant trade unionism and the Lefts refusal to think outside the Marxist economic straitjacket.

 In recent years, however, the two states have followed different economic paths.

 Bengal has moved to break the mould and woo investment, private and foreign, while Kerala has continued to grapple with economic stagnation.

 Although Kerala has earned national, even global, fame for its showing in the social sectors, its economic growth has remained sluggish. 

 Industry is an area that needs fresh thinking, Karat wrote. The public sector, he stressed, has to be defended and strengthened in the face of Right-wing assault on its existence, but added that the public sector cannot be strengthened without a process of restructuring.

 Karat was firmly with Bhattacharjee in his efforts to place Bengal on the global economic map. He warned that Kerala was fast losing the gains it had made in education and health.

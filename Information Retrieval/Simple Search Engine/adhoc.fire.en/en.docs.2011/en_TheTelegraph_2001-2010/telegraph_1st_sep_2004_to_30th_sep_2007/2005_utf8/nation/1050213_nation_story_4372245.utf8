 Students shrug off tsunami for exam

 Port Blair, Feb. 12: Over 235 girls may have lost their books to seawater, but not the will to study. They have lost their guitars, too, but it would take much worse than a tsunami to muffle their song.

 School has started in Port Blair. Children ? tribals and settlers ? appearing for the CBSE exams round the corner have been rounded up from across the archipelago and brought to two premises in the town that will be their homes till the Class X and Class XII board exams.

 ?We want to start studying,? chorus a group of Class X girls from Car Nicobar. A few lessons have been taken at the industrial hostel-turned-school, but they can start in full swing only after a shipment of books arrives from Chennai in a couple of days.

 Another 200-odd boys have been accommodated at the School Line government campus. They may have the playing field the sporty girls lack, but only makeshift rooms unlike the more comfortable girls? hostel.

 With the CBSE ? the only board in the Union territory ? agreeing to postpone exams for affected students in the islands from March to May, precious time has been bought. Schools have been destroyed, particularly in the group of islands in southern Nicobar, which has made this boarding arrangement a necessity.

 ?On Car Nicobar, no school is left,? says the principal of the girls? hostel-school, Leela Hanif. She was once headmistress of Malacca Senior Secondary School. ?I am the principal of Car Nicobar now,? she says with a sad smile.

 On these distant, scattered shores, life is far from normal and resuming studies has not been easy. Seventy-one teachers have been reported dead, of which 50 were posted at Katchal alone. While the delay in exams may cause college applicants some anxiety, the results are expected to be out before forms are issued. According to education department officials, it would have been a logistic impossibility to get the 1,861 students registered ready by March though they still can opt for the earlier shift. In Car Nicobar, three centres have been wiped out; Teressa has been totally evacuated; at Katchal, the Mildera school is being used as a relief camp, though classes are still on. Only in Camorta, the school is intact and will be used as a centre.

 Still, it wasn?t easy for Hanif to convince parents to let their children leave already severed families. ?The girls also get homesick and are upset at times,? she adds. Like Martina, who spent days weeping. She was not afraid, except on the first night. ?Some people threw a stone at the window,? scowls the Nicobarese girl. Such intrusions have been eliminated by high metal sheeting around the boundary wall, shutting out prying eyes.

 Lessons will include revision as well as the part of the syllabus that had not been covered. Food, clothes and other essentials will also be taken care of here, in association with Save the Children.

 But are the children, all of whom have been thrown off their feet by the tsunami, mentally prepared to write exams? By all accounts, the Nicobarese do not prioritise study in the normal scheme of things, preferring sports, music and other cultural spheres. So apart from therapy, singing and other cultural activities have helped shed the gloom and post-traumatic stress that has dogged them. They have had extensive yoga lessons that the girls say made them ?feel fresh?.

 And if all else fails to bring a smile to their sweet faces, just ask who their favourite star is. Hrithik Roshan wins in a show of enthusiastic hands. Girls ? however steadfast and resilient ? will after all, be girls.

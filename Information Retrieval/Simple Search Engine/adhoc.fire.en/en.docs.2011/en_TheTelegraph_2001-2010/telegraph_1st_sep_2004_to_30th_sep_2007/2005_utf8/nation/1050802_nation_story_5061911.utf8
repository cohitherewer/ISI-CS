 Train blast quartet on radar

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 The sketch of one of the suspects

 Lucknow, Aug. 1: Uttar Pradesh police are hunting for four youths from eastern Uttar Pradesh who boarded the Shramjeevi Express on July 28, posing as armymen. They are the prime suspects in the blast in one of the unreserved coaches of the train that killed 10 people.

 Passengers on the Delhi-bound express from Patna have told the police that the four boarded the unreserved coach number 1 and introduced themselves as army personnel. 

 Just after the express left Varanasi station around 2.30 pm, the quartet demanded that the passengers in coach 1 should shift to coach 2 because at Jaunpur more army personnel would board the train.

 The travellers in the coach did not obey. Had they done so, the casualty would have been much higher as the explosive went around 5.30 pm in coach number 2 that had 150 people then. The four had wanted the passengers to go to coach 2 because they wanted more casualties. 

 The railway police today released sketches of two of the suspects drawn from descriptions given by passengers now undergoing treatment in Benaras Hindu Universitys medical college.

 One of the two is five feet and 11 inches in height and in tight jeans and a black T-shirt. He is fair complexioned and has a hairstyle similar to that of Salman Khans in the film Tere Naam. The second youth is five feet and six inches tall. He had on him a black T-shirt and blue trousers. He is dark.

 The state additional director-general of railway police, B.K. Bhalla, said one of the youths had a briefcase carrying the explosives. There are uncanny similarities between this one (blast) and the ones in which activists of Students Islamic Movement in India (Simi) were accused of in the past, Bhalla said. 

 Bhalla said the medium-intensity explosives used by the four and the Simi activists were also similar. The four hail from eastern Uttar Pradesh and they also used unreserved coaches to plant the bomb like earlier blasts for which the Simi is accused, Bhalla added.

 The forensic report that was released on July 30 revealed that the bomb was made of ammonium nitrate and mobil oil. Bhalla said the suspects had used a timer device and detonator. The police later found a watch clock in coach 2. Some injured passengers recalled that the four were constantly keeping an eye on the clock, Bhalla said. 

 He added that the police were not sure yet if there was RDX in the bomb. 

 We have spoken to at least 30 of the 61 injured passengers, said a police official. Most of them have confirmed that from the language the four were speaking, it seemed they hailed from any of the eastern UP districts. The four, passengers said, got off close to Badlapur station, less than a km from the place near Jaunpur where the blast was triggered.

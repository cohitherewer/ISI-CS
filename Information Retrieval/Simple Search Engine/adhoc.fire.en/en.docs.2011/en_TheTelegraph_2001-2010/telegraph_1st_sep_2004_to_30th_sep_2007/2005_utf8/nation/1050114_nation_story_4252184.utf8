 Back to roots, with deity

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Kalavai, Jan. 13: For the Kanchi Mutt, it is a return to roots. For its senior pontiff, a symbolic ? though forced ? acknowledgement of his ?gurus?.

 Freed on bail but told not to enter the Kancheepuram mutt, Jayendra Saraswati?s decision to stay in this secluded village has shifted the focus of the centuries-old institution back to the place where his immediate predecessor became the mutt?s pontiff. 

 It was here that Jayendra Saraswati?s guru, the late Mahaswami Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, ascended to the peetam of the Kanchi Mutt in 1907 as the 68th acharya. Two of the Mahaswami?s predecessors, the 66th and 67th pontiffs, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati V and Sri Mahadevendra Saraswati, attained ?mukti? here and their mortal remains were interred in Brindavanam, the heart of the mutt?s premises in Kalavai, about 45 km from Kancheepuram.

 ?When the late Mahaswami took over the reins of the mutt at this very place, the institution then was also facing a crisis with two of his predecessors having passed away in a very short span of time,? said a devotee.

 It was only from 1953 that the Mahaswami began to stay in Kancheepuram, mutt sources said. Even then, they added, he stayed for long periods in Kalavai, his favourite haunt.

 It has, however, not been just a return to roots. Jayendra Saraswati has ensured that the soul of the Kanchi Mutt is where he is. The deity, who defines the identity of the mutt, is now in his possession. The idol of Chandramouleeshwara, along with other items required for daily pujas, had been moved from Kancheepuram to Kalavai by the acharya?s followers before he reached here from Vellore prison.

 Till the day of his release, junior pontiff Vijayendra Saraswati performed the pujas before he, too, was arrested in the same murder case that has embroiled his superior.

 With the mutt?s main idol in his possession, the senior pontiff has ensured that his position as peetathipathi will not be questioned, a source said. So even if the Tamil Nadu government succeeds in sending him out of south India till the trial is over, ?the mutt will be identified with whomever and wherever the presiding deity remains?, the source said.

 Sources said Jayendra Saraswati, who in his alleged confession in police custody had expressed dismay at his junior?s attitude on the night of his arrest in November, has won a tactical victory over him.

 Jayendra Saraswati?s lawyers, however, described the video clippings of his interrogation as ?manipulated?. In the clippings, telecast last night by some private channels, the pontiff was heard complaining that his junior was only concerned that he or his brother should not be arrested and had no concern for his ?guru?.

 The seer also staved off fresh police summons today in an assault case. A. Shanmugham, one of his lawyers, met top police officials and handed over a letter explaining how fresh summons were ?not legally enforceable? after his release on bail on the Supreme Court?s orders. He said summons could be issued only to a witness and that Kalavai did not come under the jurisdiction of Vishnu Kanchi police station where the FIR in the Shankar Raman murder case was filed.

 In Delhi, the National Human Rights Commission issued a notice to the state government, asking how selective excerpts of the seer?s interrogation were leaked to channels. It sought a written explanation within two weeks.

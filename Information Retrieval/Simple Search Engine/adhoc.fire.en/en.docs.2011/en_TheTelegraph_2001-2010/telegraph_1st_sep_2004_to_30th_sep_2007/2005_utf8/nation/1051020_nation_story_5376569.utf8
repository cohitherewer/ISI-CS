 Govinda cries foul over don video clip

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 19: A television channel tonight aired a video clip showing a person who looks like actor and MP Govinda with underworld dons Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan at a public function in the United Arab Emirates.

 The video appears to have been shot nearly 12 years ago at a shopping plaza in Dubai when Dawood and his friend-turned-foe Rajan were still together in an undivided underworld outfit.

 The clip shows a person resembling a much younger Govinda posing with Dawood and Rajan, and later cheerfully shaking hands with fans.

 Govinda later told reporters that it was a political conspiracy against him and he would raise the issue in Parliament.

 His secretary Shashi Prabhu said: I have seen the video clip. The clip looks manipulated. Govinda is currently shooting at Madh Island. He is likely to make a statement tomorrow.

 According to senior Mumbai police officers, the video belongs to the period when Bollywood stars mingled with the Dubai underworld. We had seized several photographs and video tapes which showed top film stars at Dubai functions. But, after the March 12 blasts investigations, the scenario changed, said an officer.

 In 1997-98, Bollywood was at the receiving end of the underworld with several extortion calls, threats and attacks being reported.

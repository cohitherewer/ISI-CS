 Bastion challenge for Laloo pillar

 Madhepura, Feb. 13: Laloo Prasad Yadav did not canvass for the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s man in his favourite Madhepura town, the district headquarters, from where his message would have travelled far and wide in the region.

 Shobha Samrat Theatre, which specialises in raunchy desi cabaret and more, did roaring business at the Singheshwar and Sonepur fairs, before Patna High Court objected to the ?vulgar? shows being staged by the mobile theatres late last year. 

 The two facts are intertwined and Madhepura ? the Gope (Yadav) Vatican ? feels insulted this time.

 The owner of Shobha Samrat Theatre, Siya Ram Yadav, is the RJD candidate from Madhepura. ?We, then, are pimps. These are strong words but then that is how we feel. Siya Ram, who has made a fortune, happens to be close to Kartik Singh, a powerful Rajput contractor. The relation runs deep and it has had a role to play,? said a young man, who used to be an RJD loyalist.

 ?Laloo Prasad perhaps would have got ?information? on our preparations for him in Madhepura had he decided to come here. It is good that he did not come because the RJD is not used to black flags and much more that we had meticulously planned for him. Madhepura has been the land of Yadav intellect and home to stalwarts like B.P. Mandal,? said his friend.

 B.P. Mandal was the architect of the Mandal Commission Report, which triggered the ?new politics? in Bihar and elsewhere in 1990.

 Sitting RJD legislator and minister R.P. Yadav, who was denied a ticket, is lying low. The constituency is holding its breath for the polling day. The theatre man is shooting like a blind arrow ? campaigning, it seems, without a programme.

 B.P. Mandal?s nephew, Manendra Kumar or Om Babu, is the Janata Dal United?s candidate and Pappu Yadav is backing an Independent, Chandra Shekhar Yadav. The chinks in the bastion, vacated by Laloo Prasad after he was elected MP from Chhapra, are much too evident.

 Shobha Samrat Theatre was just Shobha Theatre till a few years ago and its rustic nautch girls were a huge draw, especially at the Singheshwar fair, a few kilometres from Madhepura. Siya Ram was a guard at the theatre.

 Shobha, the original owner and a good dancer herself, ensured that her son studied well. The boy got a prestigious government job. He wanted her mother to wind up the ?nasty? business.

 Shobha found a ready buyer in Siya Ram who added ?Samrat? to the name for some reason. His good connections helped and the theatre did excellent business.

 No one knows why the RJD chief opted for Siya Ram, whose ambitions had definitely started to soar high. Many theories are going around in Madhepura ? most of them with a financial hint.

 ?Perhaps Laloo Prasad was not properly briefed on the candidate. He could not have done the impossible to Madhepura,? said another RJD supporter who has switched sides.

 Madhepura has always been the thermometer of the RJD?s rapport with Yadavs, who, along with Muslims, have been Laloo Prasad?s twin pillars of support. The ruling party, then, is facing a litmus test in the region.

 ?It (RJD) must pass the test if Laloo Prasad?s politics has to go on. But Madhepura is also known to be very ruthless as far as elections go. Laloo Prasad tasted his first defeat here. In any case, things look blurred in Bihar this time,? said a senior lawyer.

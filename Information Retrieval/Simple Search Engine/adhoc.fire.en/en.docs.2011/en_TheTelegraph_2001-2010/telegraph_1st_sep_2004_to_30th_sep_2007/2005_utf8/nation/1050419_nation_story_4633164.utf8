 ?Steel? test in power delay

 - Govt posers for Paswan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 18: The ?steel frame? that ?binds? Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party has started to melt because of the delay in the formation of a government in Bihar.

 On his part, Paswan has again promised that a popular government will come to office within three months but his reluctance to reveal the ?formula? has clearly raised the frustration of his colleagues in the party, which has the crucial 29 legislators needed to try out any fresh experiment.

 Soon after at least two MLAs indicated that attempts should be made to cobble up a ?UPA-like? government with the support of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, senior LJP leader Nagmani suggested that the party should consider joining hands with the NDA to ?respect the anti-Rashtriya Janata Dal mandate?.

 Nagmani, a prominent Kushwaha leader of the LJP, is not known to speak on his own without proper consultations with other senior leaders of the party. ?At the outset, it looks like an attempt to counter the pro-RJD stance of some of the MLAs. But Nagmani has definitely gone against the position taken by Paswan all along wherein he has ruled out joining hands with the BJP or the RJD in any manner,? an LJP leader said.

 He asserted that the RJD leaders had got in touch with some of the legislators and their ?positive inclination? had prompted Laloo Prasad Yadav to announce that a ?secular? government would be formed within 90 days.

 The RJD chief had refrained from naming the chief minister under the new arrangement but he had said the LJP was a part of his definition of ?like-minded? parties in Bihar.

 ?It is a strange position. Laloo Prasad promises a government in just 90 days. Paswan says it will be formed in three months. Both of them need to join hands for the realisation of any such possibility. Clearly, they are making political statements without any coordination with each other,? the LJP leader said.

 After its recent attempt to win over Paswan failed, the Janata Dal (United) has been lying low. It has instead asked its 55 MLAs to fan out in their constituencies and ask the people to administer them ?oath?. The BJP has not spoken a word on its strategy for several days although it has dared Laloo Prasad to name the LJP legislators who were allegedly being ?lured? to desert Paswan.

 The LJP president has favoured central rule and said it should continue for a reasonable time to cleanse the state of the ?filth accumulated in 15 years of RJD misrule?. His assertion that a government will be formed in three months, therefore, stipulates that he wants an end to central rule even before it completes its first stint of six months.

 The LJP leader said there were ?definitely some differences? within the party on the issue but most of the legislators were still opposed to the RJD as well as the BJP. ?The differences could ultimately manifest on caste lines,? he said.

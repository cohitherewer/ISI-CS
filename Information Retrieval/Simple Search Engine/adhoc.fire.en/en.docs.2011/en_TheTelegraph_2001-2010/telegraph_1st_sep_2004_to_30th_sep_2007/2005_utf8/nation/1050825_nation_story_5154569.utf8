 Kher ends battle with Surjeet

 mumbai (PTI): Actor and former censor board chairman Anupam Kher has withdrawn a defamation case filed against Harkishen Singh Surjeet after the former CPM general secretary stated that he had no intention to harm his reputation.

 Surjeets lawyer Ram Jethmalani submitted a letter to a magistrates court here on Wednesday saying his client had no intention of defaming him. 

 Kher filed the case after Surjeets articles in a party publication allegedly described him as an RSS agent and accused him of saffronising the censor board as its chairman.

 The impugned statement making a comment on Kher was merely a political statement referring to policy and not character, the letter said. 

 peaking to reporters, Kher said: I am satisfied with Surjeets response and hence have decided to withdraw the case.

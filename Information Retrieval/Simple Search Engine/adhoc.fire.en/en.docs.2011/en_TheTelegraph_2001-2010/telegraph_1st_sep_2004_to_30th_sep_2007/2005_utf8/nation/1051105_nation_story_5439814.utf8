 George, Advani precedents for govt

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: As the BJP today announced a protest programme, a section within the government backing Natwar Singh cited examples from the Vajpayee regime where ministers had stayed put despite controversies.

 Wrestling over the issue of whether or not the external affairs minister should quit in the wake of the Volcker report, this camp cited how George Fernandes had held on as defence minister in the Vajpayee government even after the Tehelka scandal over bribery in defence deals.

 It also pointed out that L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti continued as ministers though they were facing charges in the Babri Masjid demolition case. 

 This section apparently feels the BJPs campaigns against the government have already claimed two ministers: Shibu Soren and Jagdish Tytler. 

 Natwar, they claimed, could not be bracketed with them because of his seniority. If he were dropped, the BJP would taste blood, well and truly, they said.

 The BJP announced today after a meeting Advani, its president, had with senior members, it will launch a protest week across the country from November 8 to 15 to demand Natwars head.

 Backers of Natwar in the government think the minister should make a suo motu statement in Parliament and then play by the ear after assessing the Oppositions response.

 The Prime Minister, however, does not wish another controversy to whittle his image when Parliament is about to convene, from November 23. 

 The BJP has targeted him more sharply than Natwar in its attacks so far. Singh is in any case uncomfortable with the flak he received for the post-election goof-up by the Congress in Jharkhand and the Nanavati Commissions report on the Congresss role in the 1984 anti-Sikh violence.

 He had his way with the Congresss political managers on both the occasions, but after being painted in black, at least in the case of Jharkhand where a minority government was put in place.

 It seems, however, that the BJPs attack will be focused more on Sonia Gandhi. Party sources said the main slogan against the Congress will be: Vidheshi netitrav, videshi paisa (Foreign leadership, foreign money).

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani will address rallies. 

 The National Democratic Alliance has also sought time from President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to present a memorandum of charges against Natwar and the Congress.

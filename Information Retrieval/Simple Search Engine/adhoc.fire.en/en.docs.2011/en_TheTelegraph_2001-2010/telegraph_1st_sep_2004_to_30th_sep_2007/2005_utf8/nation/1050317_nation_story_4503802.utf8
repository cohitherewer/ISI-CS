 Modi will stay, Advani tells rival

 Modi: Secure

 New Delhi, March 16: BJP president L.K. Advani today sought to cap the show of dissidence against Narendra Modi by politely but firmly informing Keshubhai Patel that he will not be replaced as Gujarat chief minister because of the ?good? work he has done on the economic and development fronts. 

 Patel, who was Modi?s predecessor, was told that Advani was unlikely to grant an audience to those Gujarat MLAs who wanted the chief minister out and that he (Patel) should explain the central leadership?s stand to them.

 Patel was invited for an hour-long sitting with the BJP chief over lunch. 

 Although he has been lying low, Patel was believed to be the author of the latest round of dissidence against Modi. 

 According to BJP sources, the only ?concession? Advani was prepared to make to Patel was to appoint his protege, Vallabhai Katheria as Gujarat BJP president in place of Rajendrasinh Rana whose term will end shortly.

 However, it was learnt that Modi has said no to Katheria?s appointment because he believes it would pave the way for Patel to regain his clout in the organisation and become ?pro-active? in the government?s running. Patel was unavailable for comment but sources close to him maintained that Advani?s stance could make things ?worse?.

 ?What is happening in Gujarat should be taken seriously by our high command. They should recognise that Modi is the root of the problem,? said a senior MP. 

 The Gujarat BJP?s immediate problem is that the panchayat elections are due in a couple of months and if the ?existing trend? persists, the BJP will be ?wiped? out.

 ?There is near paralysis in the party organisation. The CM and his colleagues are out of bounds for party workers. Their complaints are not attended to. Even the state party chief can?t access the ministers. Workers? morale is so low that nobody feels motivated to work for the elections,? the MP added.

 Although dissidence against incumbent chief ministers and particularly Modi is not new, there are two big differences between the past and the present. 

 Firstly, Patel managed to get the senior leaders including Kashiram Rana, Suresh Mehta and Rajendrasinh Rana, on his side. 

 The claim of this side was one-third of the MLAs were against Modi. 

 Secondly, unlike in the past, when almost everyone was coy to speak out, this time nobody was prepared to keep quiet. Following Advani?s diktat, that the problem should not be taken to the media, the leaders wished to stay anonymous. ?If Advani doesn?t listen to us, we have to find other means,? said sources.

 The dissidents? problems with Modi are: his inaccessibility, refusal to recognise the ?worth? of the organisation and its workers, unwillingness to share power by expanding his cabinet and appointing the heads of headless public sector corporations, and allowing a small cabal of his ministers and the bureaucracy to run roughshod over everyone else.

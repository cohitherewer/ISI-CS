 Back home, Kalam in office

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was back at his official residence and in office only 24 hours after getting his fractured shoulder fixed in hospital.

 Kalam, his right shoulder strapped, was discharged from the army?s research and referral hospital here at 10.30 am. He had undergone a non-surgical procedure yesterday to correct the fracture he suffered after he slipped and fell on Sunday while supervising arrangements to throw open the Mughal Gardens.

 ?His Excellency has shown a very good recovery. He is in fine health,? hospital commandant Major General L.P. Sadhotra said, conveying the opinion of a panel of army and civil doctors that attended to the President.

 ?His right shoulder,? Major Gen. Sadhotra said, ?has been immobilised for the time being for proper healing, following which gradual physiotherapy will be started.?

 The immobility notwithstanding, Kalam spent more than half-an-hour in his office soon after arriving at Rashtrapati Bhavan, said S.M. Khan, the Presidents press secretary.

 Kalam will stay put in the capital for at least a fortnight, a Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesman said this evening.

 According to Sadhotra, a panel of physicians will examine the President twice a week and decide how long his shoulder should be kept strapped for complete healing. He would, however, attend to his normal work in his office.

 In the evening, the President met L.K. Advani, the Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha and NDA convener George Fernandes. He also met the governors of Assam, Meghalaya, Orissa and Rajasthan, all of whom had gathered in Delhi for a governors? conference that was cancelled following Kalam?s injury.

 The conference has been rescheduled and the President?s scheduled visit to the tsunami-hit areas of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on February 11 has been postponed, the Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesman said.

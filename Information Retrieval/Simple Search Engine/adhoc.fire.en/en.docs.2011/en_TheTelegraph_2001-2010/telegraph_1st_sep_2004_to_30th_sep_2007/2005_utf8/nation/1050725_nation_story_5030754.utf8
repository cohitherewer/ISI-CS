 Rethink on tougher CrPC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 24: A clutch of prosecution-friendly changes to criminal law is likely to be revoked though they have obtained the Presidents assent.

 The latest amendments to the criminal procedure code (CrPC), passed in Parliament but not yet notified, prompted a nationwide lawyers strike recently. Legal experts feel the new laws are too tough on the accused.

 Following inputs from the law ministry, Union home minister Shivraj Patil is understood to have given an assurance that the objectionable provisions would be rescinded.

 The three most controversial changes relate to anticipatory bail, recording of evidence and identification parades.

 Under the new rules, an accused must appear in court while seeking anticipatory bail. If the plea is rejected, police can straight away take him into custody before he can appeal to a higher court. Currently, an accused is arrested only after all higher courts reject his petitions.

 Two other amendments remove the necessity that recording of evidence ? and identification parades ? be done only before a judicial magistrate. The new rules say an executive official, such as a village administrative officer or tehsildar, is good enough for both. This official cannot be cross-examined during trial. Lawyers feel this amounts to handing judicial powers to the executive.

 Another amendment empowers a magistrate to ask the prosecution to appeal against a sentence if he finds it too light. This, lawyers feel, will pave the way for tough punishments even for petty crimes.

 Thousands of petty offenders spend years behind bars waiting for trial, anyway ? often for periods longer than the prison terms laid down for the offences, a lawyer said.

 Senior counsel K.M. Vijayan, however, said some of the amendments are good and should be retained. For instance, from now on, when someone is arrested his relatives or friends must be informed and the person shown to them. They must be told in which police station the accused will be kept and which court he will be produced at so that they can arrange for a lawyer.

 Another provision, opposed by lawyers, allows an accused to be declared proclaimed offender if he is absent in three consecutive hearings. His property can be confiscated.

 Currently, to be tagged a proclaimed offender, an accused must satisfy several other conditions, such as possessing a long criminal record.

 The government is reconsidering revoking the bad amendments and retaining the good ones, sources said.

 If that happens, then no notification will be issued on the amendments, though the bill has been passed and the President has given his assent, a legal expert said.

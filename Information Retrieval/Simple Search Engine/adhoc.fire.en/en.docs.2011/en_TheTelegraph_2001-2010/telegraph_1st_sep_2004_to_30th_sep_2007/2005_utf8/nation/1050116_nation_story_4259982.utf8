 Cash crunch stalls Cong lift

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Jan. 15: Octogenarian Ram Asray Mishra called the elevator at Jawahar Bhavan. The freedom fighter from Ujjain, who had come to renew his Congress membership, was told to take the stairs.

 The Congress, which has been out of power since December 2003, is in dire straits. The coffers have run dry, forcing party chief Subhash Yadav to sack over a dozen employees, including the lift operator. The power supply to the elevator has also been snapped as part of ?cost-cutting?.

 A stunned Mishra left from the foyer. A heart patient with high blood pressure, Mishra said he could not have climbed the stairs even if he wanted to. 

 But about a fifth of the 240 Pradesh Congress Committee members cannot, even if they want to. They are medically unfit to climb the 60-odd step to their third-floor offices in the state Congress office at the busy Roshanpura roundabout.

 Congress insiders said the resource crunch is so grave that Yadav has not signed salary cheques of 35 employees. Eleven of them, mostly telephone operators, office assistants, peons and storekeepers, have been handed pink slips without clearing their dues. The remaining 24 have been given an option to take a 25 per cent salary cut or quit.

 As a sop, Yadav has promised to pay them ?with interest? once the Congress returns to power. But the employees would have none of it. They have decided to hold a dharna outside the office, call a strike and even fast unto death.

 Other ?austerity measures? include disconnection of all telephone lines with STD facility and an instruction to office-bearers not to entertain guests or journalists with tea or coffee.

 The drive comes at a time when the high command has ordered an embezzlement probe. Senior leader H. Hanumanthappa, who has been handpicked by Sonia Gandhi to hold party polls in the state, said over Rs 50 lakh is missing from the party coffers.

 He has slapped showcause notices on about 90 office-bearers, who have not deposited money in exchange for membership coupons that they had obtained.

 In the Congress, each primary member ? there are over 20 lakh in the state ? pays a subscription of Rs 3 every year. The money is raised through ?active members?, who are supposed to enrol at least 25 primary members each.

 Hanumanthappa alleged that while the membership figure is over 20 lakh, the corresponding money collection is less than Rs 10 lakh, a deficit of Rs 50 lakh.

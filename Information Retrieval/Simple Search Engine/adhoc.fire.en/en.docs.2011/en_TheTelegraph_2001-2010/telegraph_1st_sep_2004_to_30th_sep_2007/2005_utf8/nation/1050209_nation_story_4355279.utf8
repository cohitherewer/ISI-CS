 No work, no pay? Not if you?re an MP

 Bhopal, Feb. 8: Lawmakers who agree to disagree on everything, from panchayat to Parliament, are unanimous in their rejection of a ?no work, no allowance? formula proposed to check disturbances in legislatures.

 Cutting across party lines, Madhya Pradesh MLAs disagree with the suggestion that MPs and members of state legislatures should not be paid their daily allowance if the House is adjourned without transacting any business as a result of trouble caused by members.

 ?No work, no allowance? is one of the 15 recommendations proposed at the two-day All India Whips Conference in Hyderabad on Sunday. Twenty-two party whips from the Congress, the BJP, the Left and other parties favoured linking the payment of daily allowance to attendance and conduct of business in the House.

 The whips urged the Manmohan Singh regime and all state governments to amend the relevant acts quickly to bring the ?no-work, no-allowance? rule into force.

 But the parties themselves are singing a different tune. 

 Congress spokesperson Girija Vyas said: ?All political parties will have to collectively take a decision in Parliament and concerned state legislatures. All that I can say is that at the moment, it is merely a proposal by the whips.?

 Whips are not leaders of their respective parties, Vyas added. The proposal was made at a conference of whips but the decision has to be taken by the leaders in the House.

 The BJP?s Vijay Kumar Malhotra rejected the suggestion outright. The party?s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha said: ?It is a ridiculous idea. We get a very small amount of Rs 500. It hardly has a bearing on Parliament expenditure. The principle of ?no work, no pay? should then mean that we get overtime when we work from 11 am to 9 pm or through the night for budget discussions.? 

 Only the CPM?s Nilotpal Basu is backing the idea. ?We have actually implemented this principle earlier. During the NDA regime, the Opposition wrote to the secretary-general asking him to deduct our allowances on such days when Parliament was not functioning,? the Rajya Sabha leader said. 

 In Madhya Pradesh, both the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress agree with Malhotra that this is a ?poor idea?. State parliamentary affairs minister Kailash Vijayvargiya said the provision would hurt the weaker sections most. ?Some of them are not that articulate in the House but they nurse their constituencies well,? he said. Laws and fines cannot cure unruliness, he added.

 ?Unless the ruling party and the senior Opposition members are honest and serious, little can be done to run the House smoothly,? the minister said. 

 State Congress leader and deputy Speaker in the Assembly, Hazarilal Raghuvanshi, agreed with the BJP minister. ?What an MLA gets as allowance is insignificant to them. Nowadays, there is a single point agenda ? to stick to power ? and they all do what they think will get them that,? the six-time MLA said, flaunting his snow-white moustache. 

 Raghuvanshi said he has known MLAs who have won successive elections without opening their mouth in the House. ?You see, debating on budget and scoring points in the discussions do not necessarily fetch votes.?

 Checkup for Kanshi

 New Delhi, April 8: In two separate orders, the Supreme Court today asked a team of doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences to examine RJD legislator Pappu Yadav and BSP founder-leader Kanshi Ram, who is ailing at Mayavati?s residence.

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha said: ?The team of doctors would have to determine whether the line of treatment given to Kanshi Ram at (Mayavati?s) home was appropriate and is it necessary for him to be treated in the hospital.? 

 The order came on a petition by Kanshi Ram?s mother alleging her son was being ill treated by Mayavati, who had kept him as a prisoner. 

 Mayavati?s counsel said she had no objection to AIIMS doctors examining Kanshi Ram.

 The same bench permitted treatment of Yadav at AIIMS, following a report given by a medical board constituted to go into his pleas for getting treatment at the hospital.

 The Supreme Court, however, made it clear that ?proper security arrangements? had to be made if Yadav were to be treated as an in-patient and his visitors would be confined to nearest family members. 

 The court has sought both reports within 10 days.

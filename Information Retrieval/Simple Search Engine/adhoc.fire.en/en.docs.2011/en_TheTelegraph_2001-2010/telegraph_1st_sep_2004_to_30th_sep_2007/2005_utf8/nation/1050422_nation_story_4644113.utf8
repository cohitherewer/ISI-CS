The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Minister at minor marriage

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, April 21: Around 20 ?couples? below 18 tied the knot at a function in Sarguja district in the presence of a cabinet minister of Chhattisgarh.

 The minister in question, Ramvichar Netam, not only blessed the minors but also performed the kanyadaan. 

 The organiser of the ceremony is also a minister of state, sources said. A total of 137 couples tied the knot in the ceremony held at Srikot village, about 130 km from Ambikapur on the Jharkhand border, on the occasion of Ramnavami.

 Speaking to The Telegraph after the ceremony, Netam said: ?I regret attending the ceremony.? He, however, denied having any knowledge that the minors were selecting their ?better halves? at the function, where he spent two hours. It was a mistake and he would be careful in future while attending such functions, Netam, who looks after the tribal welfare ministry, explained. 

 The marriages were conducted under the banner of the Satya Sanatan Dharma Samaj. Sanskrit board chairman and state minister Chintamani Maharaj was the main organiser of the event.

 According to Maharaj, while the age of most participants was verified by going through their school certificates, some were left out as they had never been to school. Besides, there were some tribal girls who attended the function as they were unable to resist the temptation of marriage, he claimed.

 ?I don?t know,? said 10-year-old Muniya, when asked why had she come to the ceremony. Minor ?groom? Golu said he did not know who his wife would be till the last moment, ?We were told that clothes, utensils and cash would be given.?

 MLA Siddharth Singh and senior administrative and police officials were present at the ceremony.

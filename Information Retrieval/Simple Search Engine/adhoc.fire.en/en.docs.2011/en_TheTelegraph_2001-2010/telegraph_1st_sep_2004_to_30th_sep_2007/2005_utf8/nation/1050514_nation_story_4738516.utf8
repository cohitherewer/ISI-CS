The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 SC no-balls Zee appeal

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 13: Zee Telefilms has lost the court battle to secure telecast rights till 2008 from the Indian cricket board, which had earlier awarded it the contract only to cancel it and call for fresh bids.

 The Supreme Court today dismissed Zees appeal challenging a Madras High Court order that allowed the Board of Control for Cricket in India to grant telecast contracts to anyone on its own terms.

 This has paved the way for a fresh round of tenders in which Zee, too, can participate like any other bidder.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices N. Santosh Hegde and G.P. Mathur threw out the Zee petition after hearing lengthy arguments for the company by senior counsel Harish Salve.

 Zee, however, can sue the board. You can move a civil court for seeking damages, the apex court said.

 But it refused to interfere with the May 2 order of Madras High Court that upheld the boards decision to cancel the original tender process for the award of TV rights for international cricket matches in India till 2008.

 Zee had emerged as the highest bidder and bagged the contract ahead of the Australian cricket teams tour of India. But ESPN-STAR approached Bombay High Court challenging the award, prompting the board to cancel the entire tender process. After some controversy, the series telecast rights went to Doordarshan,

 But a spiral of litigations lifted the matter to the Supreme Court.

 Madras High Court was moved for a stay on telecast of the Australia series by Doordarshan ? a case which, too, came to the apex court. It stayed the litigation and allowed the telecast.

 After the interim order, the Supreme Court said Madras High Court would decide the merits of the case ? that is, whether Zee is entitled to the contract or whether the board reserves the right to change its award of contract.

 A division bench of Madras High Court set aside an order by a single-judge bench, asking the board to call for fresh tenders and allowing Zee and ESPN-STAR to participate in the fresh tender proceedings.

 Zee opposed this on the ground that it had already been awarded the contract, but lost the appeal today.

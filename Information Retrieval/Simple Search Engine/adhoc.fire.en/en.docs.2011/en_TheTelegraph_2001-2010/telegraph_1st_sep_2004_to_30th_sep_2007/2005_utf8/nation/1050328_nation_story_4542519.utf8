 Andhra on alert, Maoists killed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, March 27: Four Maoists were killed in an encounter this morning near the Warangal-Khammam border amid intelligence claims that the rebels are planning a fresh offensive.

 The slain Maoists belonged to the Pratighatana faction. One of them, Venu, was the secretary of the faction?s district committee, said Warangal superintendent of police Stephen Ravindra.

 The Andhra Pradesh government is on the alert after an intelligence report claimed that the Maoists are monitoring the movements of several VIPs in the state and planning a major offensive to eliminate 40 prominent people.

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy yesterday reviewed the law and order situation following the report.

 The state has already sanctioned 40 bullet-proof cars for the protection of VIPS and top bureaucrats, besides a helicopter for the forces hunting down Maoists. 

 The government is also recruiting tribals to form a separate commando force for combing the forest hideouts of the rebels.

 The heat is now on Maoist sympathisers, P. Varavara Rao, Gaddar and G. Kalyan Rao, for their alleged involvement in a raid on a police station in Guntur on March 12. 

 Guntur superintendent of police Jitender said they (the Maoist sympathisers) have been booked for murder and conspiracy charges. They are likely to be arrested soon. 

 But director-general of police Swaranjit Sen has said they will not be arrested without any strong evidence against them.

 Security in all police stations and important installations here has been beefed up with sand bags piled at the entrances of the state secretariat, major banks, industries and defence labs.

 ?The Maoists are preparing for something big and we don?t want to be caught napping,? Sen said.

 Fugitives barred from polls 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: The Election Commission today struck a blow for the crusade against criminals in politics and ordered that fugitives from the law for more than six months will not be allowed to contest in the Bihar elections.

 Returning officers have been asked to delete the absconders from the voters list by September 19. 

 The commission has also set the deadline of August 19 for the Bihar government to give the chief electoral officer a complete list of absconders who have been missing for more than six months and against whom non-bailable warrants could not be executed.

 The commission said several non-bailable warrants issued by courts in the state have not been executed for more than six months. Such wanted criminals will be deleted from the list of electors.

 It is common knowledge that many of these proclaimed offenders/absconders have been contesting elections. At the time of the last elections in Bihar, the Honble Patna High Court gave a direction that if any such proclaimed offender/absconder turns up for filing his nomination papers, the police authorities should arrest them from the office of the returning officer and produce them before the court concerned. 

 Pursuant to this direction of the Honble high court, several persons were arrested by the police when they came to file their nominations; but in many other cases, these absconders evaded arrest by getting their nomination papers filed through their proposers, it was noted in a statement issued today.

 The Election Commissions decision was taken after a meeting on Thursday that was attended by chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon and election commissioner N. Gopalaswami.

 The order follows an earlier directive to the state administration on July 14 in which it said a total of 23,616 non-bailable warrants had not been executed. Returning officers can delete the names of the absconders from the voters list at any time before the last date for filing nomination.

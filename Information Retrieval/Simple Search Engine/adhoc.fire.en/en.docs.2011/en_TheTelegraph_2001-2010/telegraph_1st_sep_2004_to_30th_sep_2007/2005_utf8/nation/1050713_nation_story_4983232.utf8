 Ban follows birthday advice

 Shimla, July 12: Even beauty is not free from politics.

 After advising the Dalai Lama to accept Taiwan and Tibet as inseparable parts of China, the Chinese government has barred 21-year-old Tibetan beauty queen Tashi Yangchen Serdup from taking part in the Miss Tourism Pageant ? 2005 in Malaysia.

 Observers said the ban, after last weeks advice to the Tibetan spiritual leader on his 70th birthday, could further weaken the chances of an early solution to the Tibet problem.

 Tashi, who is an employee of the Sikkim governments information technology department but is now studying for an MBA in London, was last year crowned Miss Tibet at a contest in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.

 With the sash came the right to take part in the Miss Tourism pageant until the Chinese embassy stepped in.

 I do not want to offend anyone, including Tibet, but we do not want to have anything to do with their internal issues, said Alaric Soh, organiser of the Miss Tourism contest. We will not accept her entry if she participates as Miss Tibet.

 Other contestants, he added, include Miss China, Miss Hong Kong-China, and Miss Chinese Taipei ? an alternative name for Taiwan.

 I got an email from Alaric Soh? a couple of days back which states that the Chinese government has objected to the participation of Tashi Yangchen as Miss Tibet, said Lobsang Wangyal, the organiser of the Miss Tibet pageant in Dharamsala. He advised her to participate as Miss Tibet-China in place of Miss Tibet as has been desired by the Chinese government. 

 This is not the first time that China has exercised its influence on the participation of Tibetan beauty queens in international pageants. In February, Tashi, a Sikkim-born computer engineer from Pune University, was also barred from taking part in the World Miss Tourism Pageant in Zimbabwe.

 Earlier, however, two Tibetan beauties were allowed to participate in the Miss Tourism Pageant held in 2003 and 2004. Dolma Chhering, the then Miss Tibet, was crowned Miss Goodwill at the 2003 event.

 The organisers of the Miss Tibet pageant have strongly reacted to Chinas interference. The Miss Tibet pageant has no political agenda. This contest is organised to give a platform to Tibetan women. Weve decided not to participate in the Miss Tourism Pageant now as taking part as Miss Tibet-China would be politically incorrect. China has yet to solve the Tibet problem, said Ngawang Samdup, spokesman for the Miss Tibet pageant.

 Moscow, Dec. 4: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was today non-committal on Natwar Singh quitting the cabinet despite pressure from the Congress and a section of the government that it was the only way to counter the BJP cry for Sonia Gandhis scalp.

 Asked what he would do if Natwar volunteered to step down, Singh said: If a person takes a decision voluntarily and if the situation arises, we will consider what is to be done.

 By indicating he would not reject Natwar papers, if they were put in, observers feel the Prime Minister has enlarged the scope of his political and administrative options.

 Sources close to him, however, stressed Natwars exit would be prejudicial to the probe into the Volcker allegations by the Pathak panel and make it redundant.

 The move would also be perceived as capitulating under BJP pressure and embolden the party to step up the demand for Sonias head, the sources added.

 They maintained that Singh thought it was expedient to stick to the position that his government would get to the root of the matter and the probe would be completed expeditiously, transparently and objectively.

 Singh was also evasive on what happened at his meeting with Natwar after Anil Mathranis revelations that the former external affairs minister was involved in the Iraqi scam.

 He is a colleague of mine, he came to see me. We discussed various issues, what happened in the last two weeks. There was nothing more significant than that, Singh said.

 The only two aspects of the Volcker controversy on which he came out clear were that he had no differences, of perception or otherwise, with Sonia and that he was unmindful of the BJPs campaign.

 Asked to comment on the speculation that he wanted Natwar out and Sonia in, Singh said: No, there is no difference of opinion with Sonia Gandhi.

 As for the BJPs charges, his reply was: It shows no substance what they keep saying in Parliament We dont attach much significance to it.

 Singh said he would hopefully go in for a cabinet expansion after the winter session of Parliament. On whether he would keep the foreign portfolio or appoint a new minister, he said: As of now I have not made up my mind which way to do it.

 Sources close to him had earlier said he wanted to give the portfolio to either Digvijay Singh or S.M. Krishna.

 New Delhi, March 4: Since the President has no role in state ministry formation, questions are flying whether A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has ?exceeded his constitutional brief? by inspecting the Jharkhand MLA parade.

 The NDA had yesterday paraded 41 of its MLAs before Kalam after governor Syed Sibtey Razi ignored its claims to form the government as the largest pre-poll alliance and gifted the Ranchi crown to the Congress-JMM team instead.

 Supreme Court senior counsel Shanti Bhushan said the Constitution does not bar anyone, including the parading MLAs, from meeting the President. But beyond lending them an ear and offering advice to the governor, who holds office ?during his pleasure?, the President cannot take any decision.

 ?The Constitution does not prevent anybody from meeting the President, but he cannot come to any conclusion on who enjoys majority in an Assembly,? he said.

 Bhushan, law minister in Morarji Desai?s 1977 team, said the President?s role is advisory under the Constitution and ?after seeking explanation and clarification, he could advise a governor?.

 ?The President can certainly advise a governor, which is well within his constitutional realm and jurisdiction, and Kalam advising Razi has not amounted to any constitutional impropriety.

 ?After the President?s advice, Razi has announced that he would advance the date of floor test for the Shibu Soren ministry.?

 Justice Rajendra Sachar, former chief justice of Delhi High Court, said though the President had no role in state ministry formation, he could meet a group of MLAs or ?any group of political leaders to form an opinion?.

 ?Does the Constitution bar the President from meeting a group of MLAs?? he asked. When Supreme Court guidelines on such matters were violated, ?the President can seek clarification from government law officers, including the governor concerned, and assess the situation to form an opinion,? he added.

 ?Once the NDA paraded the MLAs before the President, they have made a political point, but constitutionally the President has no role to play in the formation of a ministry in a state,? Sachar said.

 M.N. Krishnamani, a former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, said the Supreme Court had made it clear that the floor of the House was the correct forum to prove the strength of a coalition or a party and not Raj Bhavans or Rashtrapati Bhavan.

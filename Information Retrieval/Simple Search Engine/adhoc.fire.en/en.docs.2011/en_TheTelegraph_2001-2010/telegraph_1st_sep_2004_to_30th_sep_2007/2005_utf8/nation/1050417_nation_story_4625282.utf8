 HC seal for Amarnath board

Jammu (PTI): Jammu and Kashmir High Court has held that the

pilgrimage to the shrine and has asked the state government to comply with the 

board?s decision to extend the yatra period to two months.

 Justice Pramodh Kohli, acting on a petition filed by the Punjab Shiv Sewa Samiti, also directed the Centre and the state government to provide adequate security to the pilgrims as it was their constitutional obligation.

 Double trouble for new Goa govt

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: The two-day old Congress-led government in Goa faced trouble on two fronts ? from within and the BJP, which went to court over its regime?s sacking.

 The BJP today decided to challenge in Bombay High Court governor S.C. Jamir?s ?unconstitutional and arbitrary? dismissal of the Manohar Parrikar government and agitate on the streets along with its National Democratic Alliance partners.

 Party chief L.K. Advani, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and NDA convener George Fernandes will sit on a ?dharna? here on February 8. The other leaders will fan out across the country to mobilise public opinion against the Congress.

 The threat from half a dozen of the Congress?s own legislators in Goa added to the pressure from outside. They were understood to have threatened to resign their Assembly membership if they were not made ministers.

 The threat, which came in the wake of the induction of six ministers last evening, was serious enough for the Congress leadership to rush Margaret Alva on a fire-fighting mission to Panaji this morning.

 Of Rane?s seven ministerial colleagues, only two are from the Congress, including state chief Luisinho Faleiro.

 Three are outside legislators who support the party. The remaining two ministers are among the four former BJP legislators who resigned their Assembly membership to help the Congress bring down the Parrikar government. 

 Eighteen MLAs support the Rane regime, of which 15 are from the Congress.

 The ambitious Congress legislators have chosen to press the chief minister when he is still vulnerable. Rane is yet to take a confidence vote in the Assembly. The governor has given him a month?s time to prove his majority.

 The teething trouble forced Rane and Faleiro to cancel their visit here today for consultations with the high command.

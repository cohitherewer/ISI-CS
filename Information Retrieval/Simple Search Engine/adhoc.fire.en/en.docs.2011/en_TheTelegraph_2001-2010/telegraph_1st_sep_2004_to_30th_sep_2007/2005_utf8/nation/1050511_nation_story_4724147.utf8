 Laloo has a good day in Supreme Court

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 10: The Supreme Court has accepted Laloo Prasad Yadavs ?apprehension? about one of the judges on a bench it had earlier formed to decide whether the railway minister should be prosecuted in a ?disproportionate? assets case. 

 The court said it would ask the Patna High Court chief justice to constitute the bench as it was in ?total agreement? with Laloo Prasads petition that it was the ?prerogative? of the high court chief justice, not the apex court.

 ?Now, let the chief justice fix a bench. We have no problem. We are not interested in one or the other judge. If the petitioner feels we should not do it, we will not do it,? a bench of Justices S.N. Variava, A.R. Lakshmanan and S.H. Kapadia said today.

 The case relates to a plea for sanction to criminally prosecute the minister. The plea, moved by Janata Dal (United) MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh Lallan and BJP MP Sushil Modi, sought cancellation of the bail granted to Laloo Prasad in fodder scam cases on the ground that he was interfering with trial proceedings.

 On April 26, the apex court fixed a two-judge division bench of the high court comprising Justice Aftab Alam and Justice Chandramauli Kumar Prasad to dispose of the petition within 30 days.

 However, the acting chief justice of the high court adjourned the matter without constituting the bench as Laloo Prasads counsel argued that the Supreme Court could not fix the bench of a high court as it was under the administrative jurisdiction of the chief justice concerned.

 In his application, the railway minister expressed his ?apprehension? about Justice Prasad and also appealed to the apex court for a private meeting with the judges so that he could express his doubts ?in confidence?.

 Orders by the Patna bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal also came up before the apex court today. The tax authority filed details of the orders it passed while disposing of 137 cases in 10 days, including those against Laloo Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi. No appeal has been filed against the clean chit to the couple.

 The court had taken exception to the manner in which additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasarn had said no appeal needed to be filed against the quashing of the tax cases against Laloo Prasad.

 Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati told the apex court today that he would take some more time to go through the papers. The court adjourned proceedings till July 25.

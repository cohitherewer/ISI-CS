 Twin twists in love twist

 Bangalore, Sept. 2: Bollywood flick Pyaar Mein Twist endured a twist before its release here on Friday.

 Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia fans found themselves facing no entry boards as they trooped to theatres to savour a reunion between the pair who had had the country swooning over their teenage love story, Bobby, in the 70s.

 The reason: a stay by a local court on a complaint of plagiarism by Kannada filmmaker Kavitha Lankesh. Upholding her claim that the Bollywood films plot was borrowed from her Preethi, Prema, Pranaya, the judge restrained producer Percept and director Hriday Shetty from releasing it.

 In the evening, Karnataka High Court vacated the lower courts injunction on Shettys plea that the promos had been launched four weeks ago and the movie had already been released in other cities. The order came right in time for the night show.

 Bangalore could, after all, wallow in nostalgia watching Sheetal Arya (Dimple), successful entrepreneur and mom-in-law, fall in love with Yash Khurana (Rishi), a businessman with adult children.

 At a theatre, Shikha Trivedi, a fan in her mid-40s, said: The movie (Pyaar Mein Twist) must be made in more languages because it conveys the message that love is not limited by age.

 Or by twists.

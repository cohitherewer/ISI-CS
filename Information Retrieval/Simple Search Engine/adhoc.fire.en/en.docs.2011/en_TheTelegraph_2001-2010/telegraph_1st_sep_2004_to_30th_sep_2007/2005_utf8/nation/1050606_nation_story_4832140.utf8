 Travel paper onus on airline

 New Delhi, June 5 (PTI): The Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ruled that the airline issuing tickets is responsible for checking travel papers to ensure that passengers do not face problems in transit.

 The commission held Continental Airlines guilty of deficiency in service for not checking the travel documents of a Toronto-bound family that had to return from Dubai for want of transit visa needed to board a connecting flight for the rest of the journey.

 The airline should have checked all travel documents as they alone knew what documents were required, the commission said.

 The commission asked Continental Airlines to pay Rs 10,000 to Archana Kapoor, who had already been paid Rs 50,000 for the tickets.

 The airline had challenged the district consumer forum order awarding Rs 20,000 compensation to the complainant.

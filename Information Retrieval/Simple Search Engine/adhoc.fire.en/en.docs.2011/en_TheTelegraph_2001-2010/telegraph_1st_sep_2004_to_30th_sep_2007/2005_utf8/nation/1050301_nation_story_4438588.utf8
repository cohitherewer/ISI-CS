 Study purse pleases Left 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: The Left ? the Centre?s persistent critic ? concedes the government has been guided by the common minimum programme and focused on social sector concerns.

 The CMP promises 6 per cent of GDP to education, a priority area for this government. Left parties agree the budget has made a beginning, however tentative it may be.

 The government has set up a non-lapsable fund with a Rs 7,156-crore corpus for Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA), a programme for universalisation of elementary education.

 There has been a substantive jump in the SSA allocation, up from Rs 8,004.58 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 12,536.53 crore in 2005-06. 

 Analysts, however, point out that Chidambaram allocated Rs 8,004.58 crore for nine months in his first budget. The figure in this budget has gone up to over Rs 12,000 crore but this allocation is for a longer period ? a whole year. And the amount is not enough. Chidambaram in his speech, however, assured that SSA will not suffer from lack of funds.

 The overall allocation for the human resource development ministry has increased by over 40 per cent. That the government is focusing on primary education is indicated from the hike in allocations for the mid-day meal scheme. The allocation for the scheme has almost doubled from Rs 1,675 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 3,010 crore. 

 The meal scheme has played a crucial role in improving the retention rate of children, particularly in Tamil Nadu. 

 It will benefit 11 crore children who come under the scheme.

 The CMP makes a commitment for food and nutrition security. ?Nutrition programmes, particularly for the girl child, will be expanded on a significant basis,? says the CMP. 

 The finance minister has proposed strengthening the Integrated Child Development Scheme, one of the programmes that can improve nutrition levels and reduce the infant mortality rate.

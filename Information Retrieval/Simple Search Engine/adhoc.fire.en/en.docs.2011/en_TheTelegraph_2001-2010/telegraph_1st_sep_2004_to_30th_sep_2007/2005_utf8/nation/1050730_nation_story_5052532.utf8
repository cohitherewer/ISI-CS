 Centre amp; CPM go slow on Bhel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 29: The Centre today told Parliament it hasnt taken any decision on divestment in Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel), opposed by the Left and trade unions. Hours later, the government was virtually bailed out by the CPM from embarrassment on the issue at the hands of the CPI.

 Letters have been received from workers unions and others opposing divestment in Bhel, finance minister P. Chidambaram had told the House in the morning. The objections are under consideration. No further decision has been taken in the matter.

 Later, a CPM move helped defeat CPI member Gurudas Dasguptas plan to corner the Centre on the issue during a calling attention motion.

 Dasgupta never got a chance to speak as the House was adjourned three times with the CPM joining hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) to create bedlam.

 The two parties were demanding the resignation of leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani, who has been charge-sheeted in the Babri Masjid demolition case.

 The BJP joined in the din by demanding that tainted ministers, including RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, quit their posts.

 Left sources said the CPM did not want a discussion on Bhel following Chidambarams statement.

 The CPM feels that both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi appreciate the Lefts problems with the divestment move, and that the Centre is trying to find a way out of the standoff.

 The party felt discussing the issue now and forcing some reaction from the minister would not be advisable.

 The Centre had in May decided to sell 10 per cent of its equity holding of 67.72 per cent in the state-run engineering giant through an open offer. The Left opposed the sale, sniffing a conspiracy to ultimately sell off the navratna.

 The government had reserved about 1.5 per cent ? or 15 per cent of the offer ? for Bhel employees, hoping this would be an attractive sop for the unions. But they joined the Left in opposing the sale.

 Chidambarams junior minister, S.S. Palanimanickam, told Parliament that the government has decided to list currently unlisted, profitable PSUs, each with a net worth of more than Rs 200 crore, and sell minority shareholding of the government in listed profitable PSUs.

 The Telegraph had reported that the Centre has circulated a note that of some 100 profitable PSUs, only 28 are currently listed. It is ? in the public interest if all large profitable PSUs are listed, at least on the domestic stock exchanges.

 Though Palanimanickam did not specifically say the plan will cover navratnas, he did not say it will not.

 Speck in the sea, laden with history

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA AND BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 bond with britain: Ross Island

 March 16: Ross Island is a small speck on the map with a huge history. Just off the coast of Port Blair, under colonial rule, this used to be the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 ?Whenever I see this island, I feel like ramming my ship into it,? confessed Lt Commander Rajiv Sharma, commanding officer of INS Tillangchang, with unexpected aggression.

 It is patriotism that fuels his violent reaction. Sir Hugh Ross, after whom the island is named, conducted the 1858 campaign in which the Rani of Jhansi lost her life and land. The victory, which virtually annihilated the ?rebel? forces, won the British Gwalior and Ross the title of Lord Straithairn.

 Ross was later quoted as saying: ?The Ranee was remarkable for her bravery, cleverness and perseverance; her generosity to her subordinates was unbounded. These qualities, combined with her rank, rendered her the most dangerous of all the rebel leaders.?

 Many of the 572 islands of the archipelago are named after military men who distinguished themselves in the battles at Kanpur and Lucknow. James Pattison Walker, the chairman of the Andaman Committee, arrived in Port Blair in 1858, when the first war of Independence was still fresh in public memory. Others were named after the men who first colonised the islands and some prominent appointees. 

 But on the peaceful Emerald Isles, unlike the mainland, people are quite happy to let heritage be.

 ?People here have a great sense of history, possibly because they have come here from all over the country,? explains D.S. Negi, chief secretary, Andaman and Nicobar administration. ?We would lose so much of that if these names were changed and it has never become a protocol issue.?

 In a Union territory without the politicians to play the priestly re-christening game, the Rosses, Havelocks, Neills and Peels will be allowed to stay as they are. And this is why some of the British masters? names made it onto islands dotting the south-eastern corner of the map of India:

 Richard Southwell Bourke: The sixth Earl of Mayo, made viceroy in 1869, was assassinated in Port Blair on February 8, 1872. He has a small island in north Andaman named after him.

 Henry Havelock: Lending his name to one of Andaman?s most stunning tourist attractions, he is also the most prominent soldier to be honoured. He came to Calcutta in January 1823 with the 13th light infantry. In October 1841, he joined a brigade to Jalalabad. In 1857, he hurried to Allahabad, occupied Kanpur after defeating Nana Sahib and went on to relieve Lucknow in September. His statue also stands in Trafalgar Square.

 James George Smith Neill: It is fitting that Neill Island, also famed for its beaches, neighbours Havelock. Neill was Havelock?s second in command. He was sent to the north during the first war of Independence, defeated ?rebels? in Varanasi and reinforced Allahabad and the fort. He was superseded by Havelock in the advance to Kanpur and is known for his harsh punishment to rebels. He went on to Lucknow in September, where he was shot in the street. His statue at Ayr, Scotland, reads: ?A brave, resolute, self-reliant soldier, universally acknowledged as the first who stemmed the torrent of rebellion in Bengal. He fell gloriously at the relief of Lucknow.?

 William Peel: Third son of Prime Minister Robert Peel. He entered the Royal Navy in 1838. In the first war of independence, he formed and led the naval brigade up country from Calcutta and was severely wounded at the relief of Lucknow. He died of small pox in Kanpur. His statue used to stand near the pagoda at Eden Gardens.

 Charles Cornwallis: Port Cornwallis gets its name from the man who defeated Tipu Sultan in 1791 in Srirangapatnam. He was made governor-general in 1786 and commander-in-chief later.

 Henry Montgomery Lawrence: He prepared for the defence of Lucknow during the first war of independence. After the engagement of Chinhut on June 30, he limited the defence to the residency. He was wounded during the siege and died soon after.

 Herbert Taylor Macpherson: Served under Havelock in the relief of Lucknow when he gained the Victoria Cross. He was noted for his exemplary service and severely wounded at the capture of Lucknow.

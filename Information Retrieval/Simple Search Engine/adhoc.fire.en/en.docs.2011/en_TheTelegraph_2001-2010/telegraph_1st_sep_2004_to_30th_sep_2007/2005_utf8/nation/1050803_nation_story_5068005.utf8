 City begins to count the cost

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: Seven days after the floods in Mumbai, the city remains stunned by the biggest disaster it has seen. Other parts of Maharashtra are also reeling.

 Nearly a thousand people have died in the state, with Mumbai alone reporting 430 deaths and several people are missing.

 Mumbai police could not put a figure to the missing, but unofficial estimates suggested that it could be several hundreds.

 The slums, where about 55 per cent of the citys 1.2 crore people live, have been affected the most. Several of the residents of these areas have been homeless since Tuesday.

 About 10 to 15 per cent of houses in slums were destroyed by the rains, said Celine DCruz of Sparc, a non-government organisation that works in slums. Another 10 to 15 per cent were damaged. The people in the slums lack foodgrain. Schoolchildren have lost their books, said DCruz.

 There is no estimate of the number of people affected in the slums but it would run into lakhs. The rains have not displaced slumdwellers, because they could not go anywhere, she said.

 For some, the floods have brought a new beginning. In Mankhurd, 10,000 houses were demolished during the recent government drive. About 5,000 have rebuilt their houses now, said an activist with the Alliance of Peoples Movements, of which Medha Patkar is a member.

 The demolition drive had razed 90,000 slum houses; the floods drowned more. 

 The hospitals, DCruz said, had not yet reported a significant number of water-borne diseases, which have become the greatest fear since the floods.

 But DCruz said there is an acute shortage of doctors. People are scared of outbreaks. In Wadala, people are wary of a malaria outbreak and are asking for doctors, she said.

 Damages to transport services and roads have been extensive. Of the 40,000 taxis that ply in the city, about 5,000 could be damaged in the rains, said Anand Shukla, who heads the Uttar Bharatiya Association in the city. Of the 99,000 autorickshaws, about 32,000 have been damaged, he said. 

 Services to 5 million mobile lines and 2.3 million fixed lines were disrupted.

 Show business also suffered. The shooting of several films, including the big projects Babul and Jaaneman, were stalled, said Taran Adarsh, a trade analyst.

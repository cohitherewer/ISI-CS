 UPA decks up for birthday bash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 3: The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government is gearing up for celebrations once the budget session of Parliament concludes in mid-May.

 The leading coalition partner is taking the initiative to mark the completion of the Manmohan Singh-led Centre?s first year in office. Singh became Prime Minister on May 22 last year after Congress president Sonia Gandhi declined the high office.

 ?Shortly, a meeting of the UPA coordination committee will be held for consultations on how we can celebrate the completion of one year in office,? AICC general secretary Ambika Soni said today.

 The party, she said, would want all UPA allies to be part of the celebrations, which would not be a Congress affair alone. Soni and Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Ghulam Nabi Azad are understood to have discussed the issue with Sonia today.

 Party leaders said the celebration would send a strong political message not only about UPA?s unity but also about the Congress?s ability to lead a coalition, in which the Left parties, too, are partners. 

 ?We have not only provided political leadership to the coalition but the government has also been able to initiate several path-breaking schemes and legislation in the last one year,? a leader said.

 The government has already brought out a document that spells out its achievements in the first nine months in office. The document, the leaders said, would be updated after consultations within the UPA coordination committee.

 The Congress proposes to highlight as its government?s important achievements the employment guarantee scheme bill, announcement of higher agricultural credit, the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service, repeal of the anti-terror law, significant improvement in India-Pakistan ties and the Kashmir situation, and the tsunami disaster management.

 ?We have been talking about it all the time. They are no small accomplishments in just one year for any government,? Soni said. She added that the party proposed to hold a meeting of its chief ministers around the same time as the celebrations to highlight the achievements of both the Congress and Congress-led states.

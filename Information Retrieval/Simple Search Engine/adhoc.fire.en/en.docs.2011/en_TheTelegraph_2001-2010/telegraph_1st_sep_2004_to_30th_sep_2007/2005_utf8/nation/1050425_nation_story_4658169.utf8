 Patil offers talks to Naxalites

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, April 24: Union home minister Shivraj Patil today advocated a dialogue with Naxalite groups in Karnataka rather than the use of force to crush them.

 The minister spent three hours in discussions with representatives of all political parties and voluntary organisations.

 ?The government is not interested in using weapons. They (the Naxalites) are our brothers and sisters and we know that this is a socio-economic problem than one of law and order. We can solve these problems through dialogue and discussions. But when the talks are talking place, if some people move about with arms and terrorise people, that is not correct,? Patil said.

 The home minister said he was relieved that the Naxalite issue had not assumed dangerous proportions and that the state government had kept its doors open to negotiations.

 The Union government would examine a draft amendment to the Forest Act, 1980, to facilitate development of tracts inhabited by tribals.

 Patil, however, was non-commital on special allocation of funds to combat the Naxalites. ?Your request will be placed before the Planning Commission,? he said.

 At the end of the meeting, Patil told reporters that ?we have convened this meeting to understand what causes terrorist-Naxalite activities and how they should be dealt with.? 

 Riot bill divisions

 Patil said the Centre is pressing ahead with the move to enact a law against communal violence. ?We are in the process of enacting such a law. The draft bill is ready. The bill will be introduced in Parliament after detailed discussions with our allies,? he said.

 NDA convener George Fernandes said there was no need for a separate law against communal violence.

 ?There is already more than one law to prevent it (communal violence) and the issue is can we take them (perpetrators of communal violence) to task?? he asked, reacting to Patil?s statement.

 Xmas gain out of pain

 Cards with pictures drawn by children who have lived through the tsunami being sold at an outlet in Cuddalore. Telegraph picture

 Cuddalore, Dec. 20: Writhing waves under a blazing sun with a peacock inside it. Or a painting of underwater vegetation. Not quite your typical picture-postcard drawings but they will go out across the country in the next few days wishing receivers a merry Christmas or a happy new year.

 A year after the tsunami, these pictures ? drawn by devastated children in orphanages and half-destroyed homes and portraying their yearnings and hopes ? have been turned into greetings cards.

 The drawing sessions had been held across Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts as a way of helping the children find release from trauma and pain. 

 The sketches and paintings they produced spoke mainly of the kids longing for shelter, security and role models who could inspire them to prevail against odds.

 These we have now developed into greeting cards, the sale proceeds of which will go into a rehabilitation project for the affected children, Cuddalore district collector Gagandeep Singh Bedi said.

 Class X student M. Nivas drew Santa Claus (Christmas Thaatha in Tamil) while Nidhartha, Class IX, sketched a silhouette of her idol, the Tamil nationalist poet Subrahmanya Barathi, and the national flag.

 One child just drew two ships on a calm sea, and another painted picturesque, undamaged houses.

 The Cuddalore administration has selected 26 drawings to make 50,000 cards, priced at Rs 8 each. Every picture has been superimposed onto a background showing giant tsunami waves.

 More such tsunami kids greetings cards will be printed, said D. Jagannathan, project officer with the District Rural Development Agency in Cuddalore and co-ordinator for the cards project.

 We dont just have the 2006 calendar in mind; these cards can be used to wish people on their birthdays or wedding anniversaries, too. 

 The cards are being sold through the outlets of the rural bazaar, a network that markets products made by the various rural womens self-help groups.

 We have also tied up with leading bookstores in Chennai, such as Landmark and Higginbothams, Jagannathan said.

 Anyone outside Tamil Nadu who wants a card can write an email to ruralproduct_dsms_cudyahoo.co.in.

 The authorities have also started events for women tsunami victims to lift their morale.

 Contests are being held on kolam potti (drawing of traditional designs in front of houses with rice flour), and for the best-maintained house or the cleanest toilet.

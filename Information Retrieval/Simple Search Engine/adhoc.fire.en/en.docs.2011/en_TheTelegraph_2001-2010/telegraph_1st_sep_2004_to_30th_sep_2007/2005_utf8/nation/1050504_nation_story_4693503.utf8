 Perjury rap on chief secy

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, May 3: The state government was jolted today with Karnataka High Court ordering the prosecution of chief secretary K.K. Mishra for perjury and withholding facts and documents relating to a Rs 2,250-crore road project. 

 An emergency meeting of the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition ministry tonight decided to appeal against the verdict in the Supreme Court.

 Mishra was hauled up for his affidavit dated March 31, 2005, accusing Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprises Ltd ? builders of the Bangalore-Mysore Infrastructure Project ? of having committed a fraud by failing to reveal that it had been set up by a consortium of three companies led by Kalyani Group of Industries in Pune. 

 Besides, the government had realised that the transfer of 20,193 acres for the project was in excess of what was needed, the affidavit said.

 The consortium argued that the government had hidden certain records from the court, including letters sent by the law and the public works departments. These records would prove that the cabinet had approved the project and had known about the consortium while assigning the project, it said. 

 The division bench of chief justice Naudip Kumar Sodhi and Justice B. Padmaraj directed the registrar-general (judicial) to file a complaint against Mishra and the under-secretary, department of industries and commerce, M. Shivalinga Swamy. 

 ?We direct Mr K.K. Mishra and Mr Shivalinga Swamy be prosecuted as envisaged under Section 340 CrPc for knowingly withholding important facts and documents from the court and making false statements in their affidavits filed in this court,? the bench said while disposing of two public interest litigations for the completion of the project.

 The PILs were filed by the All India Manufacturers? Association and Modamani, a former mayor of Mysore.

 The court quashed the government order forming an expert committee and a review committee to review the four-lane expressway project and to probe the land allotments for the project. 

 The judges directed the consortium to complete the project.

 The court dismissed PILs by two legislators seeking a CBI probe into the land allotments. MLAs J.C. Maduswamy, Janata Dal (U), and Sreerama Reddy, CPM, were directed to pay Rs 50,000 each as costs to the court.

 Today?s verdict marks the revival of the controversial project envisaging construction of a 111-km-toll expressway between Bangalore and Mysore along with five self-sustaining townships between the two cities. 

 Successive state governments, beginning with the one headed by H.D. Deve Gowda in 1995-96, signed MoUs and framework agreements to hand over 20,193 acres, including 6,956 acres of government land, to the consortium. 

 In 1990s, the project faced opposition from the Karnataka State Farmers? Association and environment groups as the consortium began acquiring vast tracts of agricultural land.

 No hung House in Bihar: BJP

 - ?Our promises realistic?

 K.C. PHILIP AND PTI

 Patna, Jan. 25: BJP national general secretary Pramod Mahajan today ruled out the possibility of a hung House after next month?s Assembly elections in Bihar and said it was time the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s ?15-year-old misrule? came to an end.

 ?I don?t see any scope for a hung Assembly this time. We are confident of getting an absolute majority to replace the present dispensation. Let?s use this historic opportunity to root out the RJD misrule and change the face of Bihar,? he said at a news conference. 

 Stating that the ?elections in the state are being viewed in political circles with great national importance?, Mahajan added, ?Can anybody in Bihar today count even one achievement of this government? There isn?t anything worth mentioning. Take any criterion of development and you?ll find that Bihar is right at the bottom. The RJD leadership has preferred dramas for people?s entertainment to accelerating the pace of development.?

 Mahajan, whose arrival yesterday coincided with protests over the abduction of Delhi Public School student Kislay Kaushal last week, targeted the ruling RJD on the twin fronts of crime and lack of development.

 He alleged that businessmen were leaving the state out of fear, youths were deserting for lack of employment avenues and the poor preferred to go outside for livelihood.

 ?Things here have come to such a pass that no one likes to miss the first opportunity to catch a train to Delhi or Mumbai,? Mahajan said.

 ?But this arrogant government still brags about its achievements and shamelessly asks for another five years. It is just trying to hoodwink the public,? the BJP leader added.

 Claiming that the NDA was set to gain from the ?anti-incumbency? mood of the people, Mahajan said the RJD, together with its allies, had shared 44 per cent votes while the BJP and Janata Dal (United) combine pocketed 37 per cent votes in the last Lok Sabha elections.

 ?Usually, the ruling party asks for fresh mandate on the government?s achievements and the Opposition tries to convince the electorate with promises. Take it for sure, our promises are realistic and we mean them,? Mahajan claimed.

 Senior party leaders, including its president L.K. Advani, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti and actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha will campaign in the state, he said.

 Former Union minister Ravishankar Prasad chipped in by taking a veiled dig at the Rabri Devi government. ?For the first time today the government seems to have changed. It has learnt to speak of development,? he said.

 Reacting to Mahajan?s attack, RJD leader Akhilesh Prasad Singh said, ?Development will happen, now that we have a favourable government at the Centre. When it comes to crime, Bihar is no exception?it happens in all states.?

 Sonia spares Laloo

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Feb. 1: On Day 2, Sonia Gandhi mounted an aggressive campaign against the ?mess? in Bihar but again took care not to name the ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal or its chief, Laloo Prasad Yadav.

 The Congress president addressed meetings in Buxar, Arrah and the ?communally sensitive? Bhagalpur.

 The crowd at Sandy?s Compound in Bhagalpur was impressive, much bigger than that at former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s meeting last week, or even the attendance at Laloo Prasad?s rally.

 ?Bihar ki vartmaan vyawastha ke khilaf sabhi logon ko ikattha hona hoga (People will have to come together against the present system in Bihar),? the Congress chief said.

 The BJP described the speeches as ?apologetic and defensive?. The party?s Bihar poll manager, Arun Jaitley, said it was clear that the Congress? objective was to support an RJD government after the election. ?This goes against the popular sentiments prevailing in poll-bound Bihar,? he said.

 Bhagalpur was one of the few seats that the BJP wrested from the RJD-led alliance in the Lok Sabha elections. The party?s Assembly nominee, Ashwini Chaubey, is locked in a multi-cornered fight for the constituency. The Congress has fielded Ajit Sharma while last-moment Congress deserter Shambhu Dayal Khaitan is the RJD?s nominee.

 Sonia launched a scathing attack on the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance. ?These people have no concern for the country, state or the people. They use politics to increase (the) sectarian divide and to meet their selfish objectives. The Congress has always made sacrifices for the people, before Independence and after it,? she said.

 The chairperson of the ruling alliance at the Centre iterated that the Congress would play a positive role in the formation of the next ?secular? government in Bihar and that is how the state would embark on the path of development.

 Sonia did not make a direct appeal to the minorities in the region. Bhagalpur had gone through a communal riot during Congress rule in 1989, when more than 1,000 people were killed. 

 The NDA has tried to make the riots an election issue and blamed the governments led by Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi for not providing succour to the victims.

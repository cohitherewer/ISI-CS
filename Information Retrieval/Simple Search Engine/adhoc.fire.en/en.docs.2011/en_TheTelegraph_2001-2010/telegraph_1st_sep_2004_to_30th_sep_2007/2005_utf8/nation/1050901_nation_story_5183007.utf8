 Sanctions off Tarapur 

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Aug. 31: The Bush administration yesterday moved one step closer to supplying fuel to Tarapur when it lifted sanctions on the reactor complex purchasing equipment from the US without scrutiny and licensing.

 The easing of sanctions on Tarapur fulfils a commitment made by President George W. Bush to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh here in July to facilitate expeditious consideration of fuel supplies for safeguarded nuclear reactors at Tarapur.

 The lifting of American sanctions will enable India to seek fuel and other supplies for Tarapur from other countries as well in line with Bushs promise to Singh that America will encourage its partners to also consider this request expeditiously. 

 Yesterdays notification by the Bush administration in the Federal Register also frees five other Indian entities from restrictions on purchase of US technology and equipment.

 These are the Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS 1 amp; 2), Isro Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network, the Thiruvananthapuram-based Isro Inertial Systems Unit and the Space Applications Center in Ahmedabad.

 The Kudankulam nuclear reactor and power station, which are under construction, are also covered by yesterdays announcement.

 The US had tried its best in the 1990s to prevent Russia from supplying the Kudankulam reactor to India by pressurising President Boris Yeltsin.

 The lifting of US restrictions comes only days after Anil Kakodkar, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, indulged in some rare plain-speaking on continuing US sanctions on Indian nuclear entities.

 His tone threatening, Kakodkar had said that before we take any reciprocal steps (following last months agreement between Singh and Bush), we have to closely watch what happens to the US laws on restrictions and lifting of embargo and the Nuclear Suppliers Group front.

 Kakodkar had also said that the controversial issue of separating Indias civilian and military nuclear facilities, agreed between Singh and Bush will be purely on reciprocal basis.

 Tarapur and the Rajasthan reactor are under International Atomic Energy safeguards and Kudankulam will be placed under similar safeguards when it is commissioned.

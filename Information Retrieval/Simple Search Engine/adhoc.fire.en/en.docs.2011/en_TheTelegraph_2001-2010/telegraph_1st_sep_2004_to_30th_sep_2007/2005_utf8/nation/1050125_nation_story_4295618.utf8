 Ex-cop hurls graft charge at Naveen 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

Bhubaneswar, Jan. 24: A retired police officer 

today came out of hibernation to lodge a complaint against Orissa chief minister 

Naveen Patnaik, a cabinet colleague and several bureaucrats alleging corruption 

in the controversial Tangarpada chromite mines deal.

 Surendra Nath Swain, a former inspector-general of police, today lodged a 15-page complaint against Patnaik, urban development minister K.V. Singhdeo, senior IAS officers S.P. Nanda and Hrusikesh Panda and the Board of Directors of the state-run Industrial Development Corporation Limited (Idcol) at Capital police station. 

 Swain wanted the police to lodge the case under Section 15 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Sections 409, 511, 120(B) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 

 Singhdeo was the state industries minister in 2002 when the join venture between Idcol and Jindal Strips was signed for exploring the chromite mines at Tangarpada in Dhenkanal district.

 ?Naveen Patnaik is a bigger plunderer than Nadir Shah or Genghis Khan. He wants to loot the state?s mineral resources in collusion with the private companies,? Swain said after coming out of the police station.

 The retired IPS officer said his complaint was based on the judgment of Orissa High Court last November. The court had quashed Idcol?s decision to select Jindal Strips as a joint venture partner for exploring and developing the chromite mines. 

 Asked what took him so long to file the FIR, Swain ?reportedly close to former chief minister and Congress leader J.B. Patnaik ? said: ?I got the order in December last year. I was writing an English novel at that time. After I went through the order, I had problems of getting a DTP printout of my FIR.? 

 ?Besides, I had to keep it a secret for fear of the government?s reprisal,? he added. Swain has given the police 24 hours to register the case, failing which he would move the high court. 

 Bhubaneswar superintendent of police Amitav Thakur said the police would properly study the complaint before lodging an FIR. ?We will do so by tomorrow,? he added. 

 Reacting to the allegations, the chief minister said, ?The allegations are all concocted. Swain just wants to be in the limelight.?

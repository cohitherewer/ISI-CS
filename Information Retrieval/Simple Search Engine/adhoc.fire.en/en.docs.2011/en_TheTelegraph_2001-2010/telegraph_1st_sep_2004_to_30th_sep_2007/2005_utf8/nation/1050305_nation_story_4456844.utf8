 Private hands for clean Bhubaneswar

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, March 3: The wave of outsourcing leaves nothing untouched, not even the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC).

 In a bid to ease the pressure on the BMC, the Orissa government has decided to outsource the services of private agencies. The experiment, slated to begin next week, will involve garbage collection and cleaning of roads in the first phase.

 A couple of private firms with experience in civic services have been selected for the phase, which will cover 14 of the 47 wards in the city.

 ?We are doing it on an experimental basis. If it succeeds, then we will replicate the experiment in the remaining wards,? newly-appointed commissioner of BMC Satyabrata Sahoo told The Telegraph. 

 While the BMC requires about 5,000 sweepers to keep the roads clean, its current strength of about 1,300 is grossly inadequate. Besides, the corporation has failed to provide solutions to the problems of trade unionism and strikes, adding to the city?s civic woes.

 BMC authorities believe that outsourcing is the cure for all civic ills. ?We had no way out. Sanitation is an important aspect of civic services. With the government freezing jobs about eight years ago, privatisation of municipal services is a natural progression,? Bhubaneswar mayor Mihir Mohanty said.

 Asked if privatisation will lead to sweepers losing their jobs, he said, ?No?we would engage them in the remaining 30 wards to ensure that the roads are clean.?

 Urban development minister K.V. Singhdeo said the municipal corporations of Cuttack and Berhampur can follow in the footsteps of the BMC if the experiment meets with success.

 While the authorities are hoping for a positive outcome, the All-Orissa Municipal Employees? Federation (Aomef) has strongly criticised the move to outsource civic services. Last month, the Aomef members sat on a dharna before the BMC office and raised slogans against outsourcing. 

 President of the federation Prabhat Tripathy said vacancies in several Grade-IV posts are yet to be filled up and demanded that sweepers be employed on a contract basis

 But Singhdeo and his team of officials have refused to give in under pressure. ?We will go ahead. It is our collective wish that the experiment succeeds,? the minister said.

 Besides sanitation, collection of the holding and property taxes, maintenance of public toilets and issue of birth and death certificates are also on the outsourcing agenda of the BMC. 

 The cash-strapped corporation loses about Rs 30 crore every year due to glitches in the tax collection system. Assessment and review of buildings, supposed to be done by the corporation every five years, have not been carried out since 1977. 

 ?Things are in a complete mess. But we can easily collect about Rs 40 crore every year from holding tax alone by privatising the system of taxation,? Sahoo said.

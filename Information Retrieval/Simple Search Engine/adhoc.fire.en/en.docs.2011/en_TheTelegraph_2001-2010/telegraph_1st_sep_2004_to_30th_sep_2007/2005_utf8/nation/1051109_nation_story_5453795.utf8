 Floods hit tsunami districts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Nov. 8: Nagapattinam and Cuddalore ? districts that bore the brunt of the tsunami in Tamil Nadu, and where many survivors still live in temporary shelters ? are now caught in floods that have also displaced almost a lakh Chennai residents.

 Nagapattinam recorded the highest rainfall in the state during the last 24 hours ? 18 cm ? inundating about 40,000 hectares of standing crops, official sources said. 

 Heavy rain, triggered by depression in the Bay of Bengal, has brought large parts of the state under water.

 Chief minister Jayalalithaa said in a statement that 50 relief centres have been opened in Nagapattinam and district collector J. Radhakrishnan has evacuated 77,000 people so far. 

 In Cuddalore, 30 relief centres have been opened for the displaced, particularly those living downstream of Veeranam Lake, which is threatening to overflow. The Paravanar river in Cuddalore has also breached, flooding nearby villages.

 Parts of Chennai are under three feet of water, trapping residents indoors. With people unable to go out to buy groceries, the Chennai corporation is distributing about 4.5 lakh food packets a day.

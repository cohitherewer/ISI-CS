The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 After 15 years, Laloo at wits end

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Laloo Prasad: Wheres the humour gone?

 Patna, Oct. 30: The wit that conquered Pakistan seems dead; the one-liners that lit up his interviews and poll campaigns seem to have taken French leave.

 After providing non-stop entertainment for 15 years to a nation of young and old, educated and illiterate, Laloo Prasad Yadav has gone and done the unthinkable: he has lost his sense of humour.

 The man with a tongue as smooth as Hema Malinis cheeks has begun spluttering with rage whenever he sees journalists, using language as tasteless as samosa without aloo.

 I dont waste my time talking to the media. You can all go to hell, he screamed recently, following it up with a string of abuses.

 My image has been spoilt by all of you bastards. There is one among you? this bastard; Ill beat him up if I see him again.

 His partymen are worried. Although they attribute their chiefs lack of humour to the Election Commissions alleged targeting of his candidates, theres a nagging fear that the cause could be deeper: maybe the entertainer has lost his touch.

 The constant ill temper and foul language is bad enough, but even his public speeches have turned boring.

 Rival Nitish Kumar, on the other hand, is all perked up. Seen as a rather dour man till now, he has been trying his hand at dry humour. But the National Democratic Alliances candidate for chief minister denies a conscious effort at an image makeover.

 It is not I who has begun to sound more relaxed. I have always been in good humour. Your perspective seems to have changed, Nitish recently told reporters.

 The Janata Dal (United) leader has been bounding across the state with the nervous energy of a teenager. I am attending at least nine public meetings in a day, he said.

 He has been campaigning mostly on his own, choosing to keep the BJPs star campaigners ? Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti, even L.K. Advani and Pramod Mahajan ? at arms length. The only BJP leader who accompanies Nitish on his campaign trips is former civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussain.

 We also have our own Muslim/Yadav combination. Sharadji (Sharad Yadav) and Shahnawaz campaign together, Nitish said.

 Laloo Prasad, meanwhile, has been leaving for his rallies alone. Wife and chief minister candidate Rabri Devi sometimes takes son Tej Pratap along with her; but even this has become a touchy topic.

 These creeps (the media) are writing that I am promoting my son. They are against me, all of them, Laloo Prasad screamed the other day.

 The contrast in the language and body language of the two star campaigners in Bihar is getting starker and starker. A sullen Laloo Prasad is bad news, most of all for himself.

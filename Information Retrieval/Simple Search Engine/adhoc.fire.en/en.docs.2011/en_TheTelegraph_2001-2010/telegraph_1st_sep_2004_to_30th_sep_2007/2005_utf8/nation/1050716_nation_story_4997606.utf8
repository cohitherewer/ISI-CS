 Delhi to speed up hotel drive

 New Delhi: The government has decided 

 to expedite the process of allocating land for 40 new five-star 

 hotels here to meet the high tourist inflow during the Commonwealth 

 Games, scheduled in 2010, reports our correspondent.

 Union minister for law and justice H.R. Bhardwaj said talks are on with the Planning Commission to identify and provide land for constructing hotels on a priority basis.

 The minister said the private sector should concentrate on building hotels rather than just designing townships. These hotels would permanently add to the hospitality industry on a long-term basis.

 He asked the hospitality industry to form a high-powered committee and point out the legal framework required for the growth of tourism and its allied sectors. Both the tourism and aviation sectors are opening up and the change is felt by all. It is important that the hotel industry also comes up to match the demand of such high tourist inflow by providing class accommodation at reasonable rates, Bhardwaj said. 

 Intruder dies at forces hub

 Meerut (PTI): A suspected suicide by 

 a postal employee on the premises of the Reserve Armed Force

 The body of Kuldeep Kumar Singhal, Bahadurpur village post office in-charge, who allegedly committed suicide by consuming some poisonous substance, was found in a bathroom on the RAF premises here, senior superintendent of police Rajiva Kumar said on Friday.

 A court of inquiry has been ordered to find out how the postal employee entered the RAF battalion premises breaking tight security, said S.P. Pukhrial, the battalion commandant. He termed the incident a serious lapse of security.

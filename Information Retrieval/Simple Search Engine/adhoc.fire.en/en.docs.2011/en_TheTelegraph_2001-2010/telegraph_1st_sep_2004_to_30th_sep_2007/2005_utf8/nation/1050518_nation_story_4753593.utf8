 PAN stick amp; push for govt

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, May 17: Parliaments Public Accounts Committee has pulled up the Centre for tardy allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN) cards and urged it to expedite the process as the number of income-tax payers is increasing every year.

 The committee also asked the government to complete the computerisation network programme linking cities by June 30. It pointed out that only 60 cities are connected so far. The remaining 418 are yet to receive expenditure sanction from the government.

 The committee has said that in all non-deficiency cases, PAN as well as PAN cards should be allotted within 10 working days.

 The panel also criticised the government for introducing schemes under the Council for Advancement of Peoples Action and Rural Technology (Capart) in haste, without proper planning and without framing guidelines for their implementation.

 Despite PAN being mandatory for various financial transactions and identification purposes, thousands of people are yet to get cards owing to the slow pace of allotment.

 The committee, in its 51st report presented to Parliament last week, recommended that a time-frame be set up within which all identified assessees should be allotted PAN cards. 

 V.K. Malhotra, the committees chairman, who is also deputy leader of the BJP in the Lok Sabha, suggested continuous monitoring of the working of UTI Investors Services Limited and National Securities Depository Ltd, the companies to which the business process of PAN has been outsourced.

 Commenting on Capart, the committee felt there was unequal distribution of funds among states and Union territories for implementation of rural development schemes. 

 It said the states should receive assistance in proportion to their rural population, while the ministry could assist voluntary organisations in developing rural technology.

 The panel had asked the ministry to apprise it of the recommendations of the Institute of Public Auditors and the action thereon to avoid the rush of grants sanction in March.

 The ministry wrote to the committee saying the procedure for the release of funds was being followed strictly, but the reply was devoid of details. The committee has now sought these details in addition to the results achieved so far in utilisation of funds.

 Vajpayee: What next?

 April 30: The debate on the ?old versus new? in the BJP was revived today when its vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi declared at a rally in western Uttar Pradesh that the next Lok Sabha elections will be fought under a leader from the ?next? generation. 

 Although he did not mention Atal Bihari Vajpayee or L.K. Advani by name, sources close to Naqvi said what he ?meant? was ?there was no way either Vajpayee or Advani would be able to lead the party in 2009 (when the next elections are scheduled) as both will be well into their eighties?.

 Another BJP vice-president, Bal Apte, who was present with Naqvi in Rampur, said: ?Too much is being made of what he said by the media.? 

 But the statement created a fresh wave of consternation in the BJP and forced Naqvi to issue a ?clarification? in which he claimed he ?merely repeated? what Advani had said in a TV interview he gave shortly before becoming party president last July. 

 Advani had said the BJP had no dearth of ?capable and talented? leaders who could head the party by the time the next elections came.

 ?These are the same leaders who have been created and nurtured by Advani and Vajpayee,? Naqvi said, adding that ?the guidance and leadership of Vajpayee and Advani has always been there and will continue even if a second-generation leader leads the party in the next elections?. 

 He also sought to cap the speculation on the differences between the BJP and the RSS and said the two were ?made for each other?. ?The next election would be a struggle between the Nehru-Gandhi parivar and the Sangh parivar, between dynastic politics and nationalism,? proclaimed Naqvi.

 BJP sources claimed Naqvi?s ?clarification? came after he spoke to Advani, who is in Chennai. Another vice-president, M. Venkaiah Naidu, who is with Advani, stressed the leadership issue was not discussed at any forum. ?We are working under Advani?s leadership. Elections are far away, four years away,? said Naidu, who was Naqvi?s mentor. 

 Sources, who believe that Naqvi?s equation with Naidu was ?near-perfect?, wondered why he made the statement. 

 There was speculation that Naqvi had fallen out with his mentor and like some of his colleagues, he was ?not happy? with Naidu?s sudden reinduction as vice-president. ?He thought after Naidu?s exit, he had finally stepped out of his shadow and he now fears he may have to play second fiddle to him again,? said a source.

 ?Managing? Naqvi will be one of the several tasks Advani will have to engage in in the days to come. While he ?somehow? prevailed over general secretaries Arun Jaitley and Pramod Mahajan to work as a ?team? for the Assam polls, the sources said when he reallocates responsibilities, Advani may assign ?more important? work to Naqvi and the other ?malcontent? functionaries.

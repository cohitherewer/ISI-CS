 3-week breather for Jaya 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, March 28: A special court hearing two cases of unaccounted wealth against Jayalalithaa adjourned after granting three weeks? time to her counsel N. Jyothi today.

 Special judge A.S. Pachhapure turned down Jyothi?s plea to grant four weeks to examine documents that were translated to English from Tamil and given to him by the prosecution.

 The documents run into 17,000 pages, along with copies of records of property acquired by the Tamil Nadu chief minister, her friend Sasikala, foster son V.N. Sudhakaran and his wife Illavarasi, and ADMK Rajya Sabha member Dinakaran. None of them attended today?s proceedings in the civil court complex here. 

 At the first hearing in March, Sudhakaran attended court while the others sought permission to skip the hearing.

 The cases were booked against Jayalalithaa and the rest under the Prevention of Corruption Act for owning assets valued at Rs 65.66 crore during her tenure as chief minister from 1991-96. 

 They were transferred to the special court by the Supreme Court in November 2003 on a plea by K. Anbazhagan, the DMK general secretary.

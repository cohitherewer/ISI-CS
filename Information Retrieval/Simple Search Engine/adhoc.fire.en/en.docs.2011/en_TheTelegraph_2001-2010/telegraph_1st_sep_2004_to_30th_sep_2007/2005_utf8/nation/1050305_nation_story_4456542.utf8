 Indian in court over SA quota

 Durban (PTI): A doctor of Indian origin 

 in South Africa has filed an appeal in Cape Town High Court 

 after his daughter was refused admission to a medical school 

 because of the ?unreasonable and irrational? policy of the 

 university based on race quotas.

 The unidentified Durban-based doctor appealed that his 18-year-old daughter, Sunira, was one of the top students applying for admission at the Cape Town Medical School University.

 He pointed out that the university had accepted Sunira?s friend, also of Indian origin, although her result was not as good. The friend was accepted because the university believed she was African, the doctor said. The university tried to withdraw its offer, but after the girl?s parents threatened legal action, she was reinstated.

 In terms of the policy, undergraduate intakes are set at 42 per cent black African; 28 per cent white; 16 per cent coloured and 14 per cent Indian. 

 African and coloured students are considered to be ?educationally disadvantaged? even if they attend private schools. Indians, however, are divided on the basis of whether they had attended private or state schools and are considered not to have been disadvantaged during apartheid.

 Telgi plea against solitude

 Mumbai (PTI): Abdul Karim Telgi, in custody 

 in the stamp paper scam, has urged the Maharashtra government 

 to allow him to mix freely with fellow prisoners, relatives, 

 advocates and co-accused as he is suffering from depression.

 Telgi, in a letter to the home secretary, said he was in solitary confinement in a special egg-shaped cell, which curtails his movement and interaction with inmates.

 Telgi claims that his medical reports show him suffering from HIV/AIDS, heart disease, ear problem, hypertension and diabetes.

 He stated that due to constant mental pressure and solitary confinement, his ailments have aggravated. ?My blood sugar level is 450-500 as against the required 80-120,? he wrote in the letter.

 Telgi?s nephews, Tabrez and Parvez, and seven relatives are also lodged at Yerwada jail in Pune, along with his lawyer Abdul Rasheed Kulkarni. He said he faced no threat from these people and hence should be lodged with them.

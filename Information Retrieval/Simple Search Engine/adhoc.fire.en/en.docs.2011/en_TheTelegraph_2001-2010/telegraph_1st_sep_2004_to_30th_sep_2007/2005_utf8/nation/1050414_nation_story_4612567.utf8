 Yes amp; no, Zahira tells riot panel

 Ahmedabad, April 13: In an ambiguous turn to the Best Bakery case, Zahira Sheikh today denied filing any affidavit before the Nanavati-Shah Commission, then immediately confirmed that the signature in the document was hers. 

 When Justice K.G. Shah read out a portion of the affidavit to her, she first denied that it was her statement. ?Only the signature is mine, the content does not belong to me,? she asserted. However, no explanation was given.

 In May 2002, Zahira had narrated in an affidavit the carnage at the Vadodara bakery which her family owned. 

 Zahira had blamed 21 people for the attack in which 14 people were burnt to death.

 The key witness, however, turned hostile later.

 Today, when Shah read out the affidavit, Zahira?s denial came even before she looked at the document. 

 The riot panel had earlier issued three summons to Zahira asking her to appear before the commission as advocate Mukul Sinha, who is representing a civil rights group, wanted to cross-examine her.

 But three times in a row Zahira did not appear before the panel and sent her advocate. She appeared today only after the commission took a tough stand.

 Today, too, her advocate Atul Mistry wanted the commission to cross-examine her after April 18.

 Mistry told the commission that the apex court had summoned Zahira and her former mentor, social activist Teesta Setalvad, on April 18. So, it would be better if his client is cross-examined after April 18, he said. But the panel asked Zahira to appear tomorrow. 

 The panel has also sent a communication to former President K.R. Narayanan to know if he stands by his reported statement in a Tamil magazine castigating former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for his failure to take prompt action during the riots by deploying the army.

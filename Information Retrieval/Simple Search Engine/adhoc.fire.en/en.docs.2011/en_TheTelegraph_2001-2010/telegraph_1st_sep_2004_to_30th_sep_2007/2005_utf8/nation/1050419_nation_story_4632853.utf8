 BSF bristles at Bangla border squad

 OUR BUREAU

 Agartala/Guwahati, April 18: The BSF has decided to take a fresh look at its relations with its Bangladesh counterpart following the murder of assistant commandant Jeevan Kumar.

 BSF Additional director-general S.I.S. Ahmed flayed the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) for the ?pre-planned and cold-blooded murder? of the BSF official and infliction of injuries on two jawans. 

 ?This was an act of deception on the part of BDR. No force of a civilised country would have done what they have done,? Ahmed said. 

 He arrived in Agartala this morning and visited the Lankamura camp of the BSF?s 131 battalion nearby. He told mediapersons at the BSF?s Shalbagan headquarters that BDR personnel have been acting duplicitously at all levels. 

 ?They are taking advantage of our goodwill gesture but this will not go on for ever. A re-look will be taken at the relations between the BSF and the BDR,? Ahmed said. 

 He added that the highest level of government had been apprised of the situation at the grassroots level and a strong protest would be lodged with the Bangladesh government. 

 He regretted that the BDR acted in the manner they did at a time when the highest officials of the two paramilitary forces ? the directors-general ? were holding a meeting in Dhaka. 

 He asserted that the ?goodwill gesture of the BSF? should not be misconstrued as a sign of weakness and a ?proactive? plan of action would be chalked out and acted upon. 

 The senior BSF official attributed the escalating tension to the BDR?s opposition to construction of barbed wire fencing and eagerness to provide shelter to militants of the Northeast.

 ?My view is that they want us to stop construction of barbed wire fencing, which will stop transborder movement of anti-Indian militants and infiltration of Bangladeshi nationals,? Ahmed said, but added that India would not ?oblige? them. 

 He did admit that an ?intelligence gap? led to the tragic incident on Saturday night. 

 ?Jeevan Kumar and the jawans were lured into a carefully laid trap by the BDR. They went unsuspectingly to the zero point for a flag meeting to arrange the release of an Indian national. Then they were encircled and trapped in a pre-planned manner.?

 He reiterated the version given by officials here earlier. He asserted that the BDR had acted in a duplicitous manner, giving one version after another and later retracting them.

 Laloo goes easy on EC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Paswan addresses a news conference in New Delhi on Monday. 

(PTI) 

 Patna, May 23: An exuberant Laloo Prasad Yadav today returned to Patna after the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly but a poser on the Election Commission put the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief in a spot.

 When it was mentioned at an impromptu news conference here that B.B. Tandon, whose appointment as chief election commissioner he had been opposing, would supervise the Assembly polls any time during the next six months, Laloo Prasad tried to evade the issue.

 Abhi yaad dilaane ka kya zaroorat hai (What is the need to remind me of that now)? he first said. But when pestered, the RJD president claimed he was not demanding the resignation of the chief election commissioner and, instead, basing his argument on the letter written by IAS officer L.V. Saptharishi, a special observer during the Chhapra Lok Sabha repoll.

 Laloo Prasad, while welcoming the House dissolution, blamed the NDA for wearing a mask of ethics and morality and actively promoting horse-trading of MLAs. The RJD chief said he was ready for elections, which should ideally be held in Bhado (the month of Bhadra), after monsoon.

 The NDA, on the other hand, went hammer and tongs against Laloo Prasad, the Congress, the Lok Janshakti Party and governor Buta Singh for alleging horse-trading and called for a Bihar bandh tomorrow.

 The Assembly had been in suspended animation for the formation of a government (at) some (point of) time. A majority of LJP legislators wanted to sever ties with the party because Ram Vilas Paswan was acting as a hindrance to government formation. It was an internal revolt in the party and there was no question of horse-trading, BJP leader Nand Kishore Yadav said.

 The balance was (tilted) in favour of the NDA. Had the prospects of a UPA government looked bright, Buta Singh would never have dissolved the Assembly. How many political parties did the governor consult before taking this decision? None at all, he added.

 With the LJP in tatters, its former state president Narendra Singh, whose son was among the rebel MLAs, distanced himself from the party. Paswan has played into the hands of Laloo Prasad. We were committed to the formation of a non-RJD government and he cheated us. Obviously, now, we will work to create a formidable anti-RJD coalition, Singh, who was among Paswans most trusted aides till recently, said.

 CPI-ML general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said the governor should be immediately recalled because the dissolution has come as a cruel joke on the poor people of Bihar. An apolitical governor should be appointed before the elections. Both the RJD and the NDA will now make desperate attempts to make the politics of Bihar bipolar. We will resist this and work for a third force, the real force of the poor people. We also appeal to the Left parties to join hands.

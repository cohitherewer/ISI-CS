 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, May 19: The chief of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army, General Liang Guanglie, is expected to visit India for four days from May 23 to take forward the military confidence-building measures that were shaped in a protocol signed last month.

 General Liang is the first chief of general staff of the PLA to visit India in seven years. He is also a member of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China and the government. 

 The last visit by a Chinese military officer of such high rank was in 1998. General Liang is here on the invitation of the Indian armed forces and he will be hosted by the army chief, General J.J. Singh. General Liang arrives in New Delhi from Dhaka and he will leave on May 27 for Turkey.

 He will meet the chiefs of the army, the navy and the air force, and will be given a tour of defence headquarters in Delhi, the para training school and the IAF transport base in Agra, the Southern Command in Pune and the Western Naval Command and its offices in Maharashtra and Goa.

 The former Indian Army chief, General N.C. Vij ? General J.J. Singhs predecessor ? had visited China in December last year.

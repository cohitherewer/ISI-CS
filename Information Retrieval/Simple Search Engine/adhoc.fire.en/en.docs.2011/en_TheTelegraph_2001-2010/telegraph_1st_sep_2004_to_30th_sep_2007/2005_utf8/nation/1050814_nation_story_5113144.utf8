 Ministers for funeral 

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: In an unusual gesture, India is likely to send two cabinet ministers to Colombo for the funeral of Lakshman Kadirgamar on Monday, reports our special correspondent.

 The likely members of the delegation are defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and foreign minister K. Natwar Singh. 

 The Indian decision to send the high-level delegation is aimed at sending out a strong signal that Delhi stands by Sri Lanka in its hour of need and will be ready to assist it in any manner to overcome the crisis in the wake of the foreign ministers assassination.

 It is the foreign minister of a neighbouring country who has been assasinated. We want to send out a loud and clear message about our stand on such acts, an Indian official said. A number of senior officials from several ministries are likely to accompany them. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke to Sri Lanka President Chandrika Kumaratunga and offered full support to Colombo.

 Normally, sending the foreign minister would have been sufficient.

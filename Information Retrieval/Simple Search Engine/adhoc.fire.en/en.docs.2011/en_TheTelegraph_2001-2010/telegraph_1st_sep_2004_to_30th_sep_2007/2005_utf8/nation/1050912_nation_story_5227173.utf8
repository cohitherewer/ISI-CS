 Discord in Left camp

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: Cracks seem to be surfacing in the Left Front, with its partners talking in different voices. The CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc are upset with the CPM, though the reasons are not the same.

 The CPI, which is joining hands with Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party for the coming Assembly polls in Bihar, is upset because the CPM is teaming up with Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress.

 The RSP and the Forward Bloc are upset with the CPM, and Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in particular, for entering into a business deal with the Indonesia-based Salim Group. However, Bhattacharjee managed to pacify the Front partners on this score last week.

 The CPM and the CPI parting ways in Bihar is likely to create animosity, especially once the poll campaigns kick off, as their candidates will be pitted against each other. The two parties assessment of the RJDs governance varies greatly.

 The CPI has stepped up its attack on Laloo Prasad. Party general secretary A.B. Bardhan argued that it would be better for the Left to go it alone in Bihar and lose rather than ride piggyback on the RJD.

 The CPI lashed out at the Rabri Devi government, claiming that the RJDs continuation at the helm of the state was damaging for the people of Bihar and asked the CPM to join the protest they organised in Bihar against the RJD. It also demanded Bihar governor Buta Singhs resignation.

 The CPM, on its part, did not utter a single word of criticism against the RJD. Its leaders always backed Laloo Prasad ? be it on the RJDs tainted ministers in the central government or MP Shahabuddin playing truant. At a press conference during the recent monsoon session of Parliament, CPM MPs said the critical factor is secularism.

 The CPM also found no fault with Buta Singhs conduct.

 There is yet another hitch in CPM-CPI relations on Bihar. The CPM remains antagonistic towards Naxalite groups and refuses to have any truck with them in the Bihar polls, though the Marxist-Leninists won seven seats on their own in the last Assembly elections. However, the CPI has decided on an alliance with the Marxist-Leninists.

 The CPM talks about the Left Front as a political entity, but Front partners believe that they live under the shadow of a bigger party that is used to setting the agenda.

 The CPIs second-rung leaders want the party leadership to distinguish themselves from the CPM in terms of policy. The decision on the Bihar elections seems to be a step in this direction.

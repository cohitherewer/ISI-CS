 Unrest in Assam 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Aug. 30: A flare-up with communal overtones engulfed Lower Assam after unidentified assailants gunned down an RSS leader in Nalbari and the BJPs student wing enforced a bandh in Barpeta to protest the alleged visit of a minister from the minority community to a Vaishnavite monastery.

 Two bicycle-borne youths shot dead senior RSS functionary Shukleswar Medhi in front of Balitora Madhyamik English School, under Ghograpar police station, around 10.15 am. 

 The VHP, Bajrang Dal and other Sangh organisations announced a bandh in Nalbari town and took out a procession against the Muslim United Tigers Liberation of Assam, blamed for the killing.

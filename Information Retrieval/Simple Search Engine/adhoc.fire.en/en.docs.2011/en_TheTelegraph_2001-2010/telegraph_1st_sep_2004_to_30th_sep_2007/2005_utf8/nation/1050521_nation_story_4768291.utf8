 Bookie names film stars

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 20: The names of more than half-a-dozen Bollywood personalities, including a star with a reputation for getting into legal trouble, have cropped up during the interrogation of bookie Shobhan Mehta by the crime branch, police sources said.

 The crime branch has been grilling Mehta to find out how the betting syndicates operate and also if he helped fix any match during the India-Pakistan cricket series that the home side lost 2-4 after taking a 2-0 lead.

 Mehta told his interrogators that a film star who had been arrested twice in connection with two criminal cases and questioned by police about the Bollywood-underworld nexus had used the bookies network to bet on cricket. The bookie has also named his actor brother as his regular client, police sources said.

 The bookie was arrested by the crime branch on May 17 on charges of cheating and under some sections of the anti-gambling act.

 The bookie told police that a big Bollywood producer-director known for his flamboyant style placed regular bets on cricket matches. Sources said the person named is a veteran actor who went on to produce and direct films and later launched his son.

 Police sources indicated that tough the Bollywood personalities were named as people who indulged in betting, they may not be directly connected with the case being investigated. 

 Sleuths have so far arrested five people, including four known bookies.

 Advani gives Modi a hand to hang on

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 21: He may be facing fire from dissidents, but as long as L.K. Advani is at the BJP helm, Narendra Modi need not worry about getting singed.

 At the three functions he attended since arriving last evening, Advani ? who had found a rare supporter in Modi after his comment on Jinnah ? showered praises on the Gujarat chief minister. He made it clear that so long he was the party president, Modis chair was safe.

 Under Modi, Gujarat has shown a new direction to all the states in the country, Advani said.

 In Patan, 200 km away, he sang the same tune. Modi is the person who has taken the BJP to strength in this state. It is due to his efforts that the party and state are in good shape, Advani said.

 Done with applauding Modi, Advani turned towards his arch-rival. He went to the Gandhinagar residence of Keshubhai Patel with Modi in tow to visit his ailing wife.

 The duo spent about 15 minutes there. They had come to inquire about my wifes health and thats all, Patel, who is the leader of the rebel camp, said. 

 Asked about Advanis comments on Modi, he said: Those were his views. 

 Earlier this week, Patel had led the dissidents to Delhi for a high-voltage campaign. They met Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advanis detractors, including Murli Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha and Madan Lal Khurana, but gave the BJP chief a miss. 

 The Modi-baiters, who had never expected Advani to entertain their demand for a change of chief minister, are not too perturbed by Advanis public pat.

 They believe Advanis show of support is bad news for Modi. With the RSS making its dislike for Advani clear, the BJP leaders boat is rocking, they said, adding that the two are likely to sink together. 

 If Advani loses his job after the Bihar Assembly elections, it will be difficult for Modi to carry on, the rebels predicted.

 We are not hassled by Advani giving a certificate to Modi?. We know what Modi is and how to deal with him, without crossing the partys lakshman rekha, said an MLA.

 Nawab seeks relief, gets lesson in civics

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Pataudi

 Chandigarh, June 14: Pleading for interim bail in a poaching case, the Nawab of Pataudi was today given a lesson in civic sense.

 What prevented him (Pataudi) from joining the investigation? You are a citizen of the country. Mighty or small, everyone should bow before law, Justice Rajive Bhalla, the vacation chief justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court told the lawyer for Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi today.

 The judge also denied interim bail to the former cricket captain.

 The anticipatory bail application of Pataudi ? accused of killing a black buck, an endangered species ? will be taken up for hearing again on Friday.

 That means police are legally free to arrest the former captain, whose whereabouts are not known, before Friday. A deadline ? twice missed by Pataudi and most of the other accused ? has been extended till Thursday for the suspects to appear before Haryana police.

 The judge also issued a notice to the Haryana government, asking it to file on Friday all papers, including the post-mortem report, related to the killing of the animal. 

 The state should produce what it has done and what it has not till date. Produce the entire records, he said.

 Pataudi and the other accused were caught with the carcasses of a black buck and two rabbits during a routine highway check on June 3 at Jhajjar in Haryana.

 Pleading for interim relief, Pataudis counsel Dinesh Mathur said the FIR was illegal as the police are not empowered to register a case on their own and start investigations. 

 He also said the FIR did not attribute any specific role to Pataudi in the alleged killing. Can eight persons commit the same offence at the same time? the lawyer asked.

 The judge then wondered why Pataudi did not join the investigation. Pataudis counsel replied that apprehension of arrest is keeping his client away from the police.

 The judge pulled up officials of the wildlife department, asking: What was the wildlife warden doing all these days? Have they conducted any investigations in the case? 

 The lawyers for People for Animals, which wants to be made a party in the case, were also treated to a tongue-lashing. 

 Are you arguing in the court or a panchayat? Dont make speeches. Dont play to the gallery, the judge told them.

 Trophies seized

 The Haryana wildlife department has unearthed over 10 deer heads and skins in the former cricketers Ibrahim Palace in Gurgaon.

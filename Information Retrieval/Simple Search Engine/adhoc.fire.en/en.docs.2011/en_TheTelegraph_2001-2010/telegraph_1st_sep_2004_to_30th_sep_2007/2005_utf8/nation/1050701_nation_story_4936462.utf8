 Hero with two faces surrenders

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, June 30: The heros halo is gone, so is the clean-shaven look.

 Gautam Goswami, the former Patna district magistrate accused of stealing flood relief money, today emerged from weeks in hiding to make a surprise surrender before a special vigilance court.

 The man declared a Young Asian Hero by Time magazine for his work during the same floods last year was remanded in judicial custody for seven days and sent to Beur Central Jail.

 Last evening, after Patna High Court had rejected his bail plea, Goswamis counsel Tuhin Shankar had not ruled out a surrender, but no one expected the official to turn up before the court in just a matter of hours, around 9 am today.

 The once-flamboyant IAS officer, who has grown a moustache during his days on the run, had to suffer being photographed despite his obvious dislike of the media glare. But he didnt speak a word in the courthouse, his expression alone betraying his anxiety as he was led to jail.

 The state government has begun proceedings for suspending Goswami, who has withdrawn his resignation from the IAS. The bureaucrat had resigned from the service and joined a corporate house as a senior executive only to be sacked after the controversy broke out.

 Governor Buta Singh said all the allegations against Goswami arising out of his tenure as Patna district magistrate will be probed by the vigilance bureau.

 The bureau will register a disproportionate assets case, too. How come a person having hardly 10 to 12 years of service has a house worth over Rs 35 lakh in Lucknow and two or three flats here? director-general of police Ashish Ranjan Sinha asked.

 The bureau has also approached the special court asking that Goswami be handed over for questioning.

 We have filed a petition to allow us to take Goswami on remand for seven days, additional director-general of the bureau, Neelmani, said. The petition may be heard tomorrow.

 The state government has ordered a probe into accusations that Goswami had filched Rs 1.52 crore worth of funds meant for urban development schemes during his tenure in Patna.

 The vigilance probe against Goswami was ordered on April 26, and an FIR registered against him and 27 others on May 28. Two days later, a nationwide alert was sounded for him and suspected scam kingpin Santosh Jha, which was followed the next day by a non-bailable warrant.

 But Goswami kept eluding the vigilance sleuths, who raided his various residences and a series of possible hideouts.

 The remand of the other accused, including Jha, has been repeatedly extended by the special court.

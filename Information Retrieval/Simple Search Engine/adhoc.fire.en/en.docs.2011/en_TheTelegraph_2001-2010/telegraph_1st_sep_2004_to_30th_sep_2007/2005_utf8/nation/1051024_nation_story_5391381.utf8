 Islamabad, Oct. 23 (PTI): Hopes of finding 43 Kashmiris who crossed the Line of Control before the quake are fast receding. 

 Of the Indians who took the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus on October 6 and the fortnight before, the authorities had heard from nine and one, Basti Ram Tandon from Jammu, had been confirmed dead.

 There is a faint hope that some of them might have been injured and will call up soon, an Indian High Commission official said here.

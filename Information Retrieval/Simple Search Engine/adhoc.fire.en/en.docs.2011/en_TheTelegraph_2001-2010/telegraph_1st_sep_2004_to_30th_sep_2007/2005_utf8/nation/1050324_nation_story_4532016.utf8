 What plot? Asks SRK

 Shahrukh

Mumbai, March 23: BJP leader Gopinath Munde today alleged that film star Shahrukh Khan was one of the beneficiaries of the Maharashtra government?s decision to dereserve 67 prime plots in Mumbai and convert them into residential plots.

 The claim drew a sharp response from Khan, who dubbed it ?false and baseless?. 

 ?I have never sought any favours from the government. The land I have was purchased from a private party and hence the question of buying the land from the government does not arise,? said Khan, who was busy in a shoot for his home production, Paheli, directed by Amol Palekar at the Film City.

 ?I have not purchased any land from the government and all the procedures carried out are as per the law. The land was bought three to four years ago through the normal course of procedure by the architect. There was nothing illegal about the whole thing as has been made out,? the actor added.

 ?Why should I go and seek favours?? he asked.

 Munde had raised the issue of dereservation of plots in the ongoing budget session of the legislative Assembly and demanded an inquiry.

 Speaking to reporters today, he named Khan as one of the beneficiaries of the move to dereserve the plots meant for schools, colleges, hospitals and recreational activities in the development plan.

 Munde alleged that the government had dereserved a 10,000 sq-ft plot in Bandra in the western suburbs of Mumbai in 2003 and had sold that to Khan to allow him to expand his house.

 It was reserved for constructing an art gallery in the development plan, Munde said.

 The plot is located behind Khan?s refurbished bungalow, Mannat, on the Bandra Bandstand and a residential complex is believed to be under construction on the plot.

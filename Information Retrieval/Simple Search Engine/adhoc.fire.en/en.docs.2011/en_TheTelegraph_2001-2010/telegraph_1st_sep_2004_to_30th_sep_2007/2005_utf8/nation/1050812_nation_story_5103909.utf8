 Media glare too hot for seminary

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Aug. 11: Shoot the messenger.

 The Darul Uloom of Deoband, irked by the adverse publicity that its controversial fatwa in the Imrana rape case invited, has decided to do just that by shutting down its media cell.

 The Darul Ulooms Majlis-e-Shura (advisory council) met last week and unanimously agreed that the row over the Imrana fatwa had brought disrepute to the countrys oldest Islamic seminary. But instead of opting for Glasnost from within, the clergy reiterated that it would not re-assess its stand.

 After Imrana accused her father-in-law of raping her, the Darul Uloom had issued a fatwa directing her to remain separated from her husband as the rape had altered their relation. The decree sparked furore across the country.

 Maulana Usman, the vice-principal of the Darul Uloom, has reportedly blamed the media for its gross ignorance. He pointed out that the seminarys charter was not to issue fatwa but to be a mere copier of old fatwas. Other scholars, too, brushed aside the possibility of ijtihad (reforms), saying conditions were not conducive to adopting them.

 At the Majlis-e-Shura, some wondered why the media was not highlighting similar issues concerning other communities. Others toed Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khans line that in the guise of Imrana controversy, the media was targeting Islam to malign the faith and its followers. 

 The council then mooted the idea of closing down its media cell, saying it was not serving its purpose. The members were then directed not to talk to the media.

 Several prominent Muslim schools of thought ? Shafiis, Malikis, Jafari Shia and Ahl-e Hadith ? and religious organisations, including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, had rejected the Darul Ulooms view that illegitimate sexual contact, including rape, could be a cause for annulling marriage. Along with former chief justice of the Supreme Court A.M. Ahmadi, the groups had pointed out that rape could not be a reason for divorce.

 A Muslim marriage is a contract but it is not so weak that it can be broken so easily, Ahmadi had said. 

 Shia scholars, too, took a similar stand as did the influential Barelvi sect, which said that since Imranas husband still believed in the honour of his wife, he could continue living with her.

 Darul Uloom authorities confirmed that the media cell had been shut down but declined to give a reason for the move. The cells in-charge, Adil Siddiqui, and his deputy Ejaz Ashraf said they would continue to offer their services to Darul Uloom in whichever capacity.

 Speaking on the condition of anonymity, some Deoband scholars hoped that the move would not disturb the other reforms initiated in recent years. 

 In 2002, Darul Uloom had taken a long overdue decision to set up a department of English language and literature, in addition to its 31 other departments that mainly focus on the Qurans articulation and phonetics, its memorisation, Islamic fiqh (jurisprudence) and khush khati (calligraphy).

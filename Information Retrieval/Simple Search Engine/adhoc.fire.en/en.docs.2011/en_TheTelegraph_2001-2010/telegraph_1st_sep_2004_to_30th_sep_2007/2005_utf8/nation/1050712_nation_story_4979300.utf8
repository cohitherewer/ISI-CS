 Hospital sucked into VIP surgery row

 - Paswans brother cries foul, escorts says only time will tell 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, July 11: Ram Vilas Paswans brother Ramchandra has demanded a CBI probe into Escorts hospitals advice of bypass surgery on the Union minister, who was airlifted from Patna to Delhi after a mild heart attack nine days ago.

 Ramchandra has alleged that the advice for surgery was unnecessary.

 CDs of angiography conducted by Escorts during the last six months to one year should be examined by government agencies, including the CBI, to find out whether bypass surgeries could have been avoided and angioplasty would have sufficed, he told reporters.

 When contacted, Escorts chief Naresh Trehan welcomed the demand. We have no problem with a CBI inquiry, the well-known cardiac surgeon said.

 Ramchandra alleged that Escorts delayed the angiography and finally conducted it on July 5, three days after the minister was brought to the hospital. He said surgeons at Escorts pressured them to agree to a bypass and warned of serious consequences if the surgery was not done within half an hour. We panicked and consulted other doctors for a second opinion, Ramchandra said.

 Later in the evening, Paswan was shifted to Max Devki Devi Heart and Vascular Institute where cardiologist Ashok Seth advised angioplasty.

 Asked why Paswan was not admitted to AIIMS, Ramchandra said: Since we took air ambulance service of Escorts, we admitted him there.

 Ramchandra said his brother was recovering fast at Max and was likely to be discharged in a day or two. 

 He was even disposing of important files of his ministries, he said.

 According to Paswans family, Escorts also did not inform them about the alternative to a surgery ? an angioplasty, which is non-invasive.

 If the allegation turns out to be true, Escorts could be in trouble, say doctors and officials of the Delhi Medical Council, which decides who can practise medicine in the capital. 

 Every patient has the right to be made aware of the possible modalities involved in all the possible modes of treatment. If the surgeon fails to provide the patient with this information, there is a problem, said Dr Khatri of the medical council.

 Trehan has rejected all the allegations against his hospital.

 We considered surgery was a safer option. If he decides to take (a) risk, it is up to him. We had explained (to) him both the options. I dont know what they understood, he said.

 It is so sickening, anybody can say anything. It is vicious. What can be done if this party wants to make an issue out of lies. Records are there to tell....

 Trehan said he stood by the advice given to Paswan at his hospital and only time will tell....

 A doctor at Trehans office said angioplasty has a 10-15 per cent risk of blockages coming back between six months and a year.

 Doctors of the Medical Council of India said though surgery was the more tried and tested treatment the world over, patients were showing a preference for non-invasive angioplasty. Though angioplasty is more expensive, it is generally safer, and thus is being preferred by those who can afford the treatment, said a doctor of the medical council.

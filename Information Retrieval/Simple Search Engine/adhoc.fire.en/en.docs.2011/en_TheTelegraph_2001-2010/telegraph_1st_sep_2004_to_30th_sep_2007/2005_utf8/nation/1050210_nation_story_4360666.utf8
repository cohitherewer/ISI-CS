 Sangh pitches for king

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: The BJP has condemned the sacking of the Deuba government in Nepal but its soul-mates, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, think otherwise.

 In direct and nuanced statements, they have backed King Gyanendra?s move and also suggested it was the only way of ?crushing? the Maoists.

 An editorial in the RSS? English mouthpiece, Organiser, (February 13), penned by editor R. Balashankar, was far harsher on the Indian government for criticising the coup than the coup itself. The reasons: Nepal was the world?s only Hindu country and, therefore, must be handled with tact. Moreover, the Kanchi acharya ? the parivar?s latest mascot ? was the king?s ?Rajguru? (royal teacher). Also, in the Sangh?s perception, a condemnation of the king meant collateral support for the Maoists.

 The editorial warned that if the ?constitutional regime? in Nepal failed, it would mean the coming of the Maoists ?which will destroy all that Nepal means for India?. It stressed that it was in India?s ?interest? to back the king in his endeavour to ?break the back of this insidious insurgency?. 

 In Allahabad, VHP working president Ashok Singhal asked the government to do ?its bit? to restore democracy in Nepal but said the sacking of the government was not ?undemocratic?.

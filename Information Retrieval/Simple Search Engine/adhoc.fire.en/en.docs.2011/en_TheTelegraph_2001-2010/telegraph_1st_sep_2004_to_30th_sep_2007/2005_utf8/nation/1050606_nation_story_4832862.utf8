 Message in seer shawl

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, June 5: The Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt has updated its red-letter day calendar to squeeze in an unlikely recipient of birthday greetings.

 Two persons closely associated with the mutt went to Chennai to greet M. Karunanidhi on June 3, the 82nd birthday of the DMK leader.

 They took with them shawls, sugar candy, a sandal garland and some books on Adi Shankara. The DMK chief accepted the gifts.

 The Kanchi Mutt had stopped sending prasad and conveying the seers blessings a few years ago but revived the practice later.

 The presence of the two well-wishers went relatively unnoticed amid the heavyweight bouquets that poured in, befitting the state Opposition partys status as a powerful partner in the central coalition.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi sent their good wishes while Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy came down to greet him on the Congress presidents behalf.

 But what was not lost later was the likely significance of the visit by the two, reportedly on behalf of the Kanchi acharya, Jayendra Saraswati, who is an accused in a murder case.

 Political circles here are now trying to see whether the visit was precursor to a possible tilt by the acharya towards the DMK, chief minister Jayalalithaas adversary and once an anti-Brahmin party that wore its atheist credentials on its sleeves.

 The mutt is not known to have had any association with the DMK, especially after Jayalalithaa returned to power in Tamil Nadu in May 2001.

 However, after the police crackdown on the acharya, a section of the upper castes in Tamil Nadu feels that had Karunanidhi been the chief minister, he would not have arrested Jayendra Saraswati, who is now out on bail.

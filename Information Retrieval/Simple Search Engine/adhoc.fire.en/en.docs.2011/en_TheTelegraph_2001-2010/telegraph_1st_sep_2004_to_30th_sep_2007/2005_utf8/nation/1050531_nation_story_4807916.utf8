 New Delhi, May 30: It is not quite the ambitious India-China-Russia axis to counter American supremacy of the past. But the meeting in Vladivostok next month of foreign ministers of the three countries is an important step forward in trilateral co-operation.

 If successful, the meet could lead to a new dimension in international equations. As of now, the agenda for the meet is mainly economic with an underlying strategic dimension. 

 When external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh meets his Chinese counterpart Li Zhaoxing and Russian host Sergei Lavrov, the discussions will be wide ranging, covering economic and trade relations, energy co-operation, security issues and a common approach on anti-terrorism. The reform of the UN Security Council and pivotal international issues will be touched on. 

 Singh is leaving tomorrow for the meeting, scheduled on June 2. It will be the first time the three foreign ministers will get together after three earlier attempts to get the process rolling. In 2002 and 2003, the foreign ministers met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and in 2004 at Almaty when they gathered for the meeting on confidence-building measures in Asia. 

 In an obvious attempt to allay any misgivings, especially in Washington, New Delhi has taken pains to point out that the engagement is not aimed at forming any power bloc.

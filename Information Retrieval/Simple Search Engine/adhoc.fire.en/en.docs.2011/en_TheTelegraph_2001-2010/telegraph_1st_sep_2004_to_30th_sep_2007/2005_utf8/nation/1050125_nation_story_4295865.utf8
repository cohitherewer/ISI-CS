 BJP rethink on Uma, Modi

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: Uma Bharti?s reported illness and hospitalisation in the capital has forced the BJP to rethink the wisdom of running a ?communal? campaign in Bihar.

 Party sources claimed that Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, too, may not be used as ?extensively? in Bihar as Haryana and Jharkhand.

 ?The party?s feedback is that Laloo Prasad Yadav has very nearly polarised the Muslim votes by resurrecting the Godhra ghost. We don?t want to make it easier for him,? said a source.

 Neither Uma nor Modi will campaign for the first phase and whether they will be used for the subsequent rounds would depend on how the ?divided? United Progressive Alliance?s show pans out and if there is ?scope? to play the Hindutva card.

 Uma?s place ? she was supposed to spend 20 days in the state ? will be taken by central and state BJP and Janata Dal (United) leaders like Sushil Modi, Nitish Kumar, C.P. Thakur, Shatrughan Sinha and Pramod Mahajan. 

 The BJP?s ?moderate and liberal? face, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ? originally scheduled to address one public meeting ? has been deployed for many more. His face will appear prominently on posters and ads jointly put out by the BJP-Dal (U), along with those of George Fernandes, Nitish and Sharad Yadav. BJP president L.K. Advani has been left out from the gallery of luminaries.

 According to sources, several reasons prompted the BJP to rethink its strategy. 

 First, Uma?s ?alarming? blood pressure reading of 200/135 and chest pain have officially grounded her in a hospital for at least a week. The party was, however, abuzz with the speculation that the ?illness? had more to do with her bete noire, Mahajan, being employed as a backup to the official Bihar ?prabari? (in-charge), Arun Jaitley, by Advani.

 The Uma-Mahajan spat dates back to her tiranga yatra (tricolour yatra) when she held him responsible for its poor showing in Maharashtra. 

 The other reason speculated on was that she was ?pressuring? the central leaders to reinstate her as Madhya Pradesh chief minister and showing them just how ?stressed? she was.

 Second, the Dal (U) made it clear that no attempt must be made to ?incite? communal passions when the BJP toyed with the idea of raking up the ?injustice? done to Muslim victims of the 1989 Bhagalpur riots to counter Laloo Prasad on Godhra. 

 ?Voters should be wooed with the help of words and not communal feelings,? said Dal (U) parliamentary board chairman Sharad Yadav.

 As a logical corollary, it was felt that Modi?s presence might exacerbate the communal tension. 

 BJP sources conceded that at this point, the imperative was to project a show of unity with the Dal (U).

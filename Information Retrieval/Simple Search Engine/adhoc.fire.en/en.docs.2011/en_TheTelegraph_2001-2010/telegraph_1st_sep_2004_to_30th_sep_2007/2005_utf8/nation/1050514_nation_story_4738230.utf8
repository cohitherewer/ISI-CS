Srinagar, May 13: Almost all parents came to pick up their children from school today, as Srinagar struggled to recover from the Lal Chowk blast.

 A grenade explosion at the gates of two schools in the area yesterday had killed two women and injured over 50 people, among them 16 schoolchildren.

 Hundreds of schoolchildren marched through the city, chanting slogans and holding placards saying we are flowers of a garden, allow us to bloom.

 Shopkeepers in Lal Chowk, the busiest area in the city, downed shutters when they came to know that the blast victims were residents of the nearby Court Road area.

 Hundreds took part in a funeral procession for the two women killed yesterday. Mourners were taken in police vehicles to the burial ground in the Dalgate area.

 But for the children marching for peace, the mourners and some protesters shouting anti-government slogans, the streets were mostly empty.

 The string of bomb attacks in the Valley continued today when a bomb wrapped as a gift exploded in a home, killing three family members. The device, placed in a box, went off near Bijbehara town, 45 km south of Srinagar.

 The explosion killed 45-year-old bus driver Mohammad Syed Kakroo, his 22- year-old son and 20-year-old daughter.

 Kakroos family received a gift-box from an unknown person on Thursday and when they opened it late in the evening, it exploded with a big bang, a police official said.

 No militant group has claimed responsibility.

 Rumours of other strikes in the city spread like wildfire, keeping most people indoors. A relative advised me on phone not to leave my home as rumours were rife that there had been bomb blasts at a number of places in the city, said a resident.

 The blasts later turned out to be tearsmoke shells the police had fired at protesters.

 In schools, too, there was an air of caution. A girl walked up to the blackboard and wrote there had been four bomb blasts in the city. Then we were told to come out of the classes for an important announcement. It was total confusion for the entire day, said Sameenah, 15, a student of an uptown school.

 There is absolutely no sense of safety anywhere in Kashmir. What business do you expect us to do when landmine and grenade explosions occur here every second day? asked a shopkeeper in Lal Chowk.

 Today was the third day in a row that an explosion spilled blood in the Valley. On Wednesday, a car bomb went off in the heart of Srinagar, killing one person and injuring 45.

 Molester headache for Sena

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 31: A policeman believed to be posted at Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackerays high-security bungalow, Matoshree, was arrested today on the charge of molesting his 20-year-old sister-in-law.

 Constable Rukmanand Kashinath Shinde, 29, was later produced before a metropolitan court and released against a bail of Rs 5,000. 

 Shinde, who allegedly attacked the woman at their home in Kherwadi near Bandra, was also taken for medical tests considering the sexual nature of the offence.

 As the rumour spread that Shinde worked at Matoshree, a group of Shiv Sainiks gathered at the Kherwadi police station, where the complaint has been registered under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with outraging the modesty of a woman.

 Sena corporator Bala Sawant denied that Shinde was one of Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackerays personal bodyguards. 

 It is possible that he (Shinde) was among the 250-odd security guards posted at Matoshree, but he was not part of Uddhavs security team, Sawant told reporters.

 Deputy commissioner Jayant Naik Navare said he was not sure where Shinde was posted. Senior officers remained tight-lipped and would neither confirm nor deny if Shinde was indeed a bodyguard of Uddhav Thackeray.

 This is the second scandal involving Matoshree personnel in recent months. 

 Thackeray seniors personal assistant Ravindra Mhatre was arrested for drunken driving after his Ford Ikon ploughed into bystanders at a Vile Parle bus stop, killing two women. Mhatre, however, was not charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

 This is also the fourth sexual offence involving a city policeman in the past two months. 

 On April 21, constable Sunil More of the Marine Drive police station was arrested on the charge of raping a 17-year-old college girl inside a police outpost at the Marine Drive promenade.

 In May, three constables were arrested after two women filed separate complaints of molestation.

 Mumbai has witnessed several sexual assaults in recent weeks, including the gangrape of a dance bar girl near her home.

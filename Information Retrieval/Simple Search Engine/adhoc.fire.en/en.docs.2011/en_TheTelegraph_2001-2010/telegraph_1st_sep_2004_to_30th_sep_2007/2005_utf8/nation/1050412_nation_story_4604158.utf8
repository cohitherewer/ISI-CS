 Councillor quits for hostage son

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, April 11: Democracy has literally been held hostage in Kashmir with militants forcing a municipal council chairman to resign in exchange for the life of his kidnapped son.

 Ghulam Rasool Dar, the Sopore municipal council chief, last evening gathered ?all his neighbours and sought a general apology for contesting the poll after which he submitted his resignation?, an official here said.

 This afternoon, his 12-year-old son, Mehraj-ud-Din, was released by the militants. They yesterday threatened to kill the boy if the chairman failed to step down within 24 hours.

 The boy was kidnapped by two militants near his home at Mehrajpora locality while he was playing cricket with friends. The abductors phoned Dar yesterday and set the deadline.

 More than a dozen elected councillors have so far resigned from their posts following threats from militants.

 Panic spread after a half-a-dozen councillors were gunned down by militants across Kashmir. 

 Several councillors had complained that the one guard detailed for each councillor is not adequate. But chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had said the elected representatives would be ?protected by their own people who voted for them?.

 Valley civic chief shot dead

 Srinagar, May 3: Militants sprayed bullets from automatic weapons this morning killing a municipal committee chairman and three policemen at Pattan, about 29 km from here, reports our correspondent.

 A group of four shot at Mohammad Ramzan Mian and his security personnel when he was shopping in the main market after supervising a cleanliness drive in the north Kashmir town, said police.

 ?The municipal committee chairman and his security guards, identified as Zahoor Ahmad and Riyaz Ahmad, died instantly.?

 A constable from the local police station, identified as Mohammad Altaf, who was part of a team which rushed to the spot, was also gunned down. The militants decamped with two Insas rifles belonging to the slain security guards. 

 A senior officer said the reinforcement from the Pattan police station went to the spot immediately.

 Over half-a-dozen municipal councillors have been killed in militant strikes since the February civic polls. The security cover provided to them has been described as ?inadequate?. The Mufti Mohammad Sayeed-led coalition government provides one personal security guard for the protection of each councillor.

 Militants this afternoon lobbed a hand grenade at a passing vehicle of the Special Operations Group in Pulwama town, 40 km from here. The grenade missed the target. 

 ?It exploded on the road, injuring five civilian bystanders. They were taken to the local hospital for treatment,? said a police officer.

 Mayavati smells plot by rivals

 New Delhi, July 5: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati has alleged a deep-rooted conspiracy between the Samajwadi Party and the BJP to be behind the militant strike on the disputed site in Ayodhya today.

 The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister demanded dismissal of the Mulayam Singh Yadav government and imposition of Presidents rule in the state to avoid such unpleasant developments in the future.

 We want to know why the Samajwadi Party government scrapped the special security arrangements at the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid complex. There seems to be some conspiracy behind it, as reduction in security led to the militant attack, she said.

 Mayavati alleged that the Samajwadi Party and the BJP want to create communal tension in the state to win elections, and the militant strike on the Ayodhya temple was to polarise Hindus and Muslims, from which both parties hoped to benefit.

 Accusing some political parties of trying to exploit the situation, the BSP president demanded that political and religious leaders should be barred from visiting the site. She charged Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders with issuing inflammatory statements.

 Mayavati said when she was chief minister, she set up special groups of security forces for Ayodhya, Mathura, Varanasi and Ambedkar Nagar in Lucknow, but the Mulayam Singh government disbanded them, weakening the security in communally sensitive areas.

 It is a well-planned conspiracy on the part of the Samajwadi Party and BJP. We feel the two parties are trying to save their fortunes in the state and are attempting to polarise Hindus and Muslims for their narrow political ends, Mayavati told reporters.

 The Centre should take the development seriously and sack the state government and initiate the right steps to impose Presidents rule, failing which there could be large-scale destruction, she added.

 Charging the Mulayam Singh government with failing to improve law and order, the former chief minister said: Earlier, political leaders and sitting MLAs were killed but now there is an attack on a religious place at Ayodhya. Nobody is safe in the state.

 She accused the BJP and its sister organisations of exploiting the situation to serve their political ends and said they should not forget the attacks that occurred during the BJP-led Nationalist Democratic Alliances tenure at the Centre.

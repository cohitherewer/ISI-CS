 Nation at a Glance

 US raises visa amp; passport fees

 New Delhi (PTI): US passport application 

 fees will be higher by $12 from Tuesday and a person applying 

 for L-1 visa will have to pay an additional $500.

 The changes are part of new charges for consular services in American diplomatic missions in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and Calcutta.

 Those applying for the blanket L-1 visa will have to pay the $500 ?fraud prevention and detection fee? at the time of submitting their papers. The fee must be paid via a bank draft for Rs 22,000 made out either to the American embassy or the American consulate-general, the US embassy here said.

 The fee does not apply to spouses or children applying for L-2 visas.

 The $12 surcharge follows a plan to introduce new security features in passports, one of them being biometric identifiers. A chip will be embedded in the cover and will contain the same information that appears on the data page, including the bearer?s picture.

 Another surcharge of $45 will be added to the current fees for immigrant visas, making the total fee $380.

 The charges include cost of changing the immigrant visa to a machine-readable format using a secure visa foil and implementation of digital photo and electronic fingerprint collection as required by recent legislative mandates.

 17000 Indians leave Malaysia

 Kuala lumpur (PTI): At least 17,000 Indians

 said.

 ?At least 4,000 nationals were issued fresh passports to enable them to return to India,? the official said, adding that many whose passports had expired could have left the country during the amnesty period.

 Police on Monday raided workplaces across the country to weed out the illegal workers. Over 110 people were arrested on charges of overstaying illegally at the end of the amnesty period. Those arrested could face heavy fines, jail sentences and whipping.

 23 held in caste clash

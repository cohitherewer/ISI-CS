 Idlis help digest weighty matters

 New Delhi, March 16: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had breakfast with Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today.

 The meeting at Chatterjee?s residence, held on Singh?s request last evening, came amid reports of differences between the government and the Speaker over the Supreme Court order advancing the Jharkhand trust vote. 

 The Centre did not accept a proposal to make a presidential reference and there were reports that it was not keen to associate itself with a presiding officers? meeting that Chatterjee has convened.

 ?The Prime Minister wanted to dispel such impressions which have been wrongly created,? parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said later. 

 Azad and leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee accompanied the Prime Minister. While the parliamentary affairs minister might have been disappointed not to find his favourite kebabs on the menu, Singh and Mukherjee enjoyed the idlis they were served.

 The Prime Minister is believed to have told Chatterjee the government was ?in full agreement and solidarity? with his initiative to call an all-party meeting after the apex court ruling as well as the proposed meeting of presiding officers of state legislatures on Sunday. 

 Chatterjee was later quoted as saying that Singh told him an impression had been created that there was a problem between the government and the Speaker, and that he wanted to dispel that.

 ?There is nothing against the Speaker and we appreciate your concerns. There is no confrontation or any such thing against the Speaker. It is for you to decide how you conduct your business,? Chatterjee quoted the Prime Minister as telling him.

 Azad pointed out that the Speaker had not spoken for himself when he suggested making a presidential reference. ?He was only conveying the sense of the all-party meeting that a presidential reference could be made.?

 Chatterjee had convened the meeting not on his own but at the suggestion of BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, he said. 

 The minister said that at no point did the government tell the Speaker it intended to make a presidential reference because, ?as a government, we are bound to implement the Supreme Court?s instructions?. 

 Even so, ?we are very much with the Speaker?, he said.

 Chatterjee said he was convinced that the Supreme Court ruling had ?crossed the lakshman rekha? because the Constitution had expressly ?debarred courts from regulating the procedures of the legislature?, adds PTI. 

 ?As a Speaker, I am not a dummy just sitting by when other constitutional authorities, however well-meaning they could be, give some directions to other constitutional authorities. It would be a very sad day for legislatures at the highest level that they can be directed in any manner on matters solely within their constitutional supremacy?. But to put this matter as legislature versus judiciary is an artificially created controversy,? he said. 

 Asked about the BJP?s now-deferred plans to bring a no-confidence motion against him, Chatterjee said: ?Well, I am hurt. I am a human being. I don?t know how long the Speaker can take it.?

 But he asserted: ?I say I will not leave under an artificially created cloud.?

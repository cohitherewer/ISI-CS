 Teachers? woes at Buta door

 FARHANA KALAM 

 Patna/Gaya, April 15: In the season of central rule, the cure for all ills seems to rest with Governor Buta Singh, at least in the eyes of the people.

 About 300 teaching and non-teaching employees of the three minority colleges in Bihar now look to the governor for the fulfilment of their long-pending demands. Direct payment facility for the non-teaching staff and post-retirement benefits, including pension, gratuity and leave encashment for both categories of employees, are two of the biggest demands of the aggrieved lot.

 According to Nasimuddin, vice-president of the Federation of Minority College Teachers? Associations of Bihar, the previous Congress government had taken a cabinet decision for the extension of these benefits to the minority college staff. 

 After coming to power in 1990, Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav revoked the decision of the previous government in this regard. The three minority colleges in the state are MG College, Gaya, Oriental College, Patna and ZA Islamia College, Siwan. 

 According to Arun Kumar Prasad, head of philosophy at MG College, these institutions were established in accordance with Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution.

 The Constitution, said Prasad, makes it obligatory on the part of the government not to discriminate against these institutions and extend financial and other benefits available to general institutions. 

 By depriving the minority college staff of similar benefits, the government had violated the provisions of the Constitution, including Article 14, which guarantees equal treatment to ?similarly-placed? citizens. 

 Asked how the non-payment of pension and other benefits violated Article 14, Prasad said the eligibility criteria, retirement age and qualifications were the same for employees of all colleges and the denial of any of the benefits to the minority college staff amounted to clear violation of the provision. S.M. Humair Ahmed, a senior teacher, hopes that the worst is over for the minority college staff and the governor will undo the wrong done to them in the Laloo-Rabri regime. 

 Sources in the higher education department said the file on direct salary payment for non-teaching employees and pension facility for both teachers and non-teachers of the minority colleges has made significant progress.

 5-hour battle busts red den

 VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR 

 Keredari (Hazaribagh), Nov. 15: Police swooped down on a new training camp of the Naxalites atop a hill here, 72 km from Hazaribagh, early today and killed three extremists in a fierce encounter that lasted almost five hours. 

 Two guerrillas were arrested during the operation, while a few managed to slip out, taking with them two of the three bodies. 

 The Naxalites had erected five large tents atop Neri, the highest of all hills in Keredari block, around five days ago. The police received a tip-off yesterday that new recruits were being given arms training at the camp. A joint team of the district police and the CRPF set out for the area last evening. 

 Hazaribagh superintendent of police Praveen Kumar Singh said the camp was set up five days ago by sub-zonal commander of the CPI (Maoist) Bhagirathi Mahto. Around 100 recruits were being trained there.

 Singh said the extremists had selected this hill due to the rough terrain and geographical location, which made it ideal for carrying out ambushes. We were alert and on the lookout for any trap the extremists may have set, the SP said. 

 The Hazaribagh police chief said as the team reached the foothills after walking for 20 km, firing began from the other side. The rebels fired incessantly from two light machine guns that they had installed on top of the hill. We returned the fire and used 2-inch mortar to chase them away, Singh said. 

 The SP said the force saw three dead bodies, but two were taken away. The body recovered has been identified as that of Mahesh Mahto. Three mobile sets, a powerful landmine, tents, utensils, several sets of new uniforms, boots, sweaters and a number of foodgrain bags were found at the spot. 

 Singh said when his men scaled the hills, they were surprised to find a medical room equipped with surgical tools and medicines. It was not possible to bring all material to the headquarters. So we destroyed most of it, Singh said. 

 The two arrested extremists Sebastian and Kuniya alias Muniya Devi, who were brought to the Keredari police station, admitted that more than 200 sophisticated weapons were brought to the training camp.

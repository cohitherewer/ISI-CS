 DTH shine for Sun TV 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: After the disappointment of losing the bid for Indian Cable Net to SitiCable, theres some good news for Sun TV. The Centre has decided to clear direct-to-home (DTH) access for Sun and Space TV, the Star-Tata venture. 

 The applications (by the two companies) conform to the stipulated guidelines and the letter of intent (LoI) will be issued in a day or two, said Surinder Kumar Arora, the new information and broadcasting secretary.

 Star and Sun will be the latest to join the DTH bandwagon. 

 Zee, with Dish TV, was the first to take off in October 2003. Doordarshans free-to-air platform was inaugurated last December by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The Rs 1,600-crore Star-Tata venture had been caught up in red tape for nearly 24 months. The company affairs ministry had expressed reservations against the proposal.

 Officials had raised doubts over the shareholder agreement and the management structure, saying it favoured minority shareholder Star, which holds 20 per cent shares in Space TV against the Tatas 80 per cent.

 The agreement had to be reworked but the government is now satisfied that Space TV has followed all the rules.

 Sun, the popular Tamil channel owed by Kalanidhi Maran, the brother of telecommunications minister Dayanidhi Maran, also faced some problems but will now get the go-ahead. Sun is seen as a DMK mouthpiece.

 The new secretary said a broadcast regulatory bill will be tabled in Parliament during the monsoon session. 

 He refused to give details but hoped the bill will take care of several issues on which there have been public concern.

 There has been an outcry from parents, educationists and lawmakers about an overdose of sex and violence on television. Arora said the broadcast bill will go into all this and come out with a set of guidelines. He added that even the current government rules were quite clear on the subject of indecent exposure on television.

 Arora said India TV, which was served a showcause notice for airing indecent footage on its channel, had replied to the government. The channel recently showed politicians in compromising positions.

 Aroras appointment has generally been welcomed in Shastri Bhavan. His predecessor Navin Chawla, who has moved to the Election Commission, was feared for his supposed proximity to 10 Janpath.

 Arora, a 1971 batch Andhra Pradesh cadre IAS officer, is familiar with the ministry as he had been working closely with Chawla as additional secretary since last October.

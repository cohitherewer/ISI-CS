 Work permits to track migrants

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: The Centre is examining the possibility of issuing work permits to illegal immigrants to keep tabs on them -- a move that could spark a fresh controversy in the Northeast.

 The scheme is under consideration of the government, junior home minister Sriprakash Jaiswal told the Lok Sabha today.

 The suggestion that the government is considering now was made by a group of ministers set up by the NDA regime. The group, in a report titled Reforming the National Security System, had proposed work permits for Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals.

 The suggestion was based on the premise that such a scheme would help keep track of illegal migrants who come in search of a livelihood and the realisation that putting in place a foolproof mechanism to check immigration may not be entirely feasible.

 The Centres plan could fuel a controversy as it is doubtful whether the northeastern states will accept it. The Congress government in Assam, too, had voiced opposition, saying such permits would encourage more illegal migrants to reach the state in search of jobs.

 Jaiswal said additional battalions of the BSF were being raised to reduce the gap between the border outposts to curb infiltration. Border patrolling was also being intensified in addition to providing modern surveillance equipment for better management, he added.

 The minister said 27,584 infiltrators were deported from Assam between 2000 and 2004, the highest in the country. Following closely are Bengal, Tripura and Delhi where illegal migrants were caught and pushed back to their countries.

 The Centre said no demand has been received for amending laws relating to the grant of citizenship to the children born to illegal migrants. 

 At a meeting on implementation of the Assam Accord in Delhi, the All Assam Students Union claimed to have demanded an amendment to the Citizenship Act, which was twice altered to give citizenship rights to the children of migrants.

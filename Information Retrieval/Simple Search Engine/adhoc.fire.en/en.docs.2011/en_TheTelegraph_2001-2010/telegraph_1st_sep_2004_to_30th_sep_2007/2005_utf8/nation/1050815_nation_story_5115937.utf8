 PM on thank you trip to Paris 

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will travel to France on a three-day visit next month to try and bring on board strategic ally Paris on the recent Indo-US nuclear deal.

 France has been one of Indias closest allies and was the only Western nation not to criticise Delhi after the May 1998 nuclear tests. The French helped block many sanctions on India following Pokhran II.

 Singh will arrive in France on September 11. The substantive talks between him and the French leadership, who will include President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, will take place on September 12.

 The trip was initially planned as a technical halt by the Prime Minister on his way to the UN General Assembly in New York, but was turned into a full-fledged official visit at Delhis request.

 Singhs chief aim is to reassure France that India has not forgotten the role it played after the nuclear test. The growing closeness between India and the US has worried many, including the French.

 Paris believes that though it has consistently backed Indias UN security Council bid, as well as its emergence as a recognised nuclear power, its contribution is fast fading from the memory of the Indian leadership.

 The Prime Minister and his aides will reaffirm Delhis close ties with Paris. The visit will also give them an opportunity to discuss the Indo-US nuclear deal and its implications.

 France, though a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), had not imposed additional sanctions on India after the Pokhran tests, unlike the US and Britain. The Blair government has already decided to remove the NSG sanctions on India, much on the lines of what Washington has done.

 Frances support is essential if the US has to change the existing NSG guidelines to accommodate India. At present, a country like India that has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty cannot receive any co-operation on its civilian nuclear sector from the groups members.

 Though energy co-operation will be on top of Singhs agenda, other subjects will be discussed. CEOs of several leading Indian companies will be part of Singhs team and the two sides are likely to discuss how to strengthen their economic and business ties.

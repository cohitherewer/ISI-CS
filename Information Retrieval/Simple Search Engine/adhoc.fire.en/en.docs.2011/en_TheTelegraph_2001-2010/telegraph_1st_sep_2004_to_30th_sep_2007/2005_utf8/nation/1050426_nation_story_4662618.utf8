 Dhaka Saarc meet

 New Delhi, April 25: The Saarc summit is likely to be held in Dhaka at the end of May or early June, reports our special correspondent. 

 The summit has already been called off twice this year.

 The budget session of Parliament ends on May 13. India has indicated its willingness to attend the summit anytime after that provided the dates are acceptable to the other Saarc members. 

 In January, the summit was called off because of the tsunami disaster. It was rescheduled for early February but called off again after India refused to participate citing poor law and order in Bangladesh. According to Saarc charter the summit cannot be held unless all seven members agree to attend it.

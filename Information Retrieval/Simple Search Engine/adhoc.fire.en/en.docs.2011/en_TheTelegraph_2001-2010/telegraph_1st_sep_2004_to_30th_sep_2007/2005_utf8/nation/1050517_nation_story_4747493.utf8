 BJP set to bring Uma back on board

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 16: There was good news for Uma Bharti from the BJP but the party was in a quandary about what it should do with Babulal Marandi.

 BJP sources said Uma was likely to be rehabilitated by being inducted in L.K. Advanis team, possibly as a general secretary. One of the seven posts of general secretary is still vacant. 

 But, sources stressed, Umas prospective appointment would have to be done through consensus and after consultations between the BJP president and his team members, particularly those who the sadhvi fell foul of with her alleged intemperate remarks. Among them are M. Venkaiah Naidu, Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley.

 Uma had held Naidu and Mahajan culpable for spoiling the tiranga (Tricolour) yatra she had embarked on shortly after a Karnataka court cleared her of charges of inciting communal riots in Hubli when years ago, she had tried to hoist the national flag atop a mosque. Sources said she suspected Jaitley of planting stories against her in his so-called de-briefings.

 Naidu is expected to return to Delhi tomorrow and Mahajan on May 20 or 21. The central office-bearers will meet on May 23 to plan the next slew of strategies to take on the UPA government and revive the BJP in Uttar Pradesh in the run-up to the 2007 Assembly elections.

 Sources said Umas appointment could be announced before this meeting. 

 Asked why Advani had softened his stand towards her ? after she snubbed him by walking out of a party meeting in full view of the media and then stating she had serious ideological differences with him ? a source said: It is a way of ensuring that things dont become more uncontrollable. Uma outside the party is a loose canon. We cannot predict what she will speak when. If she is inside, at least her shenanigans can be controlled from within.

 Sources claimed Umas prospective re-induction was a conciliatory signal towards the RSS from Advani. The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister is a favourite of the Sangh, which in the past had conveyed to the BJP that she should be taken on board. 

 The question remained if and when she becomes a general secretary, what is the guarantee she will get on with the other team-members? asked sources.

 If Advani hoped to tide over the Uma problem, his other headache ? the BJP vice-president and former Jharkhand chief minister, Babulal Marandi ? showed no sign of backing off. General secretary and Jharkhand prabhari (in-charge) Rajnath Singh and Sanjay Joshi, the general secretary (organisation), spoke to Marandi, asking him to reconsider his threat to break away from the BJP to protest the appointment of Yadunath Pandey as the state party chief. The feedback was Marandi was insistent Pandey should be dropped. He had the backing of the former central minister, Karia Munda, who nursed a long-standing grouse against the central leaders for passing him up for the Jharkhand chief ministers post.

 BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar admitted: Marandi is too valuable to us to just let go like that. Sources said he had the backing of the majority of the partys MLAs and if pushed around, could well split the BJP and bring the NDA government down.

 Already, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha supremo Shibu Soren has invited Marandi to break rank with the BJP. Sources indicated that Advani himself might speak to him today or tomorrow.

 Mamata lands at 

Kalam door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Trinamul Congress president Mamata Banerjee, who hit the headlines last week for flinging a sheaf of paper at the deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha, found another route to highlight her case.

 With the Speaker to take a call on her resignation, Mamata tried to keep herself in the spotlight. 

 She met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today and gave him a memorandum that also raised the issues of state-sponsored terrorism of the CPM in Bengal and the fear that rigging and booth-capturing would be done in a big way in next years Assembly elections with supporting documents. 

 Mamata called on Kalam with Rajnath Singh, the BJP general secretary in charge of Bengal, and NDA convener George Fernandes. Kalam reportedly assured the delegation he would look into the memorandum.

 Tomorrow, she plans to meet the Election Commission.

 Last week, Mamata had wanted to bring an adjournment motion on infiltration from Bangladesh, but she was not allowed this as the matter had been debated in the House already. This prompted he to fling a sheaf of paper at the deputy Speaker. 

 Speaking to the press later today, Mamata announced she will launch a save Bengal movement to expose the CPMs double-standards. 

 They are doing something in the state and something else at the Centre. There is no democracy in Bengal, no proper system to hold elections. The police and administration are involved in rigging, alleged Mamata.

 However, she was soft on the Congress. The Congress has some compulsions. They are in a government that is supported by the CPM. We have no compulsions, we are not afraid of the CPM, she proclaimed.

 On her resignation, Mamata said: I have not received any official communication and until my resignation is accepted, I stand by my decision. 

 Asked if she was requested to reconsider her move, she said: Then I will see.

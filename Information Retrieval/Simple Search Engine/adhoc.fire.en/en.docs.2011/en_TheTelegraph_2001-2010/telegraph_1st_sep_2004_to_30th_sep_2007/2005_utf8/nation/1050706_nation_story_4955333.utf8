 UK student visa row

 London, July 5 (PTI): After the steep increase in visa fees, Britains proposed changes to international student visa rules will discourage applicants from countries like India, university sources fear.

 The immigration bill, which is before the House of Commons, removes the right of appeal against refusal of student visas.

 Universities fear this will deter foreign students, especially from India, from applying for higher education in the UK.

 More than 200,000 students from outside the European Union are currently studying in the country, contributing to Britains ?4-billion export earnings from higher education. 

 Education ministers here are privately unhappy with the home office visa proposals.

 UKCOSA, a body that looks after international students, said many cases were sorted out informally by universities after an initial visa refusal. If there is no appeal possible, there would be no incentive to reconsider the case informally, said its chief executive, Dominic Scott.

 Is this appeal system letting in lots of bogus students? No. Poor international students have been caught up in a wider game about security of our borders, Scott said.

 Universities UK, which represents university heads, said the number of cases reconsidered was much higher than the 25 per cent of appeals that were successful and the visa process was often highly subjective.

 It said refusals would show up if a student applied again for a visa to the UK or any other country. The body is concerned about a drop in the number of overseas applications.

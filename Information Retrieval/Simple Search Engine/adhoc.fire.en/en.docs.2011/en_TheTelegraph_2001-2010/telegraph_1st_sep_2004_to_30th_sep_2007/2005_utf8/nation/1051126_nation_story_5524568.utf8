 Rabri ready to vacate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 25: Rashtriya Janata Dal president Lalu Prasad today said wife Rabri Devi has no problems vacating 1 Anne Marg if chief minister Nitish Kumar wants to move in.

 Lalu Prasad, who was addressing new party MLAs, however, added that the former chief minister should be provided an alternative official accommodation.

 The state building construction department had yesterday issued notices to Rabri Devi and several former ministers to vacate official bungalows at the earliest so that their successors could be accommodated.

 The meeting today formally elected Rabri Devi as the leader of the RJD legislature party. She is thus tipped to be designated the leader of the Opposition in the new House.

 Lalu Prasad asked his partys Union ministers to give priority to development schemes in the state, especially those related to electricity, roads and drinking water. 

 I will implement the railway schemes chalked out for Bihar, the railway minister said.

 Taking potshots at his squabbling rivals, Lalu Prasad said: This government has two chief ministers, one each from the Janata Dal (United) and the BJP. Their contradictions have already started showing. I do not understand how chief minister Nitish Kumar can function without playing into the hands of the RSS.

 High court in audit order 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 10: Continuing the hearing of the PIL on alleged misuse of funds by the Patna Water Board and Patna Municipal Corporation, the high court today directed the accountant-general to audit all accounts from 1997 and file the report within two months.

 The division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai passed the order in response to the PIL filed by Council for Protection of People?s Rights and Welfare advocate M.P. Gupta.

 ?On the recommendations of the 11th Finance Commission, the Centre had released Rs 25 crore to the two civic bodies for improving public utilities in the capital. But nothing was spent to solve the problem of water-logging, whereas a lot of bungling took place in the use of funds for improving drinking water facilities,? Gupta argued.

 In another case filed by the same lawyer for Patna Citizens? Forum, the bench directed the administration to expedite the clearance of all encroachments in the capital.

 District magistrate Sudhir Kumar and senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan, who were present in the court today, told the bench that the anti-encroachment drive has been taken up in the right earnest.

 The court has asked Gupta and another lawyer, Surendra Dwivedi, to review the drive and report to it.

 Residents of the city have welcomed the move. ?Finally, we are seeing results,? a Patna University professor said.

 Tough search for successor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Sen (top) , Haider 

New Delhi, Jan. 3: Prime Minister Manmohan 

Singh will find the job of finding a successor to J.N. Dixit difficult as few 

in the foreign policy establishment have his experience and stature.

 It may be too early for the search to begin but several names are being mentioned ? Ronen Sen, the ambassador to the US, and Salman Haider, like Dixit a former foreign secretary, among them.

 Retired foreign service officer Chandrashekhar Dasgupta and the former chief coordinator in Afghanistan, Sati Lamba, could be the other candidates.

 Sen worked closely with Rajiv Gandhi at a time when the Prime Minister?s Office began to play an important role in deciding foreign policy issues. But Singh may not want to pull him out of the US as he has only recently moved to Washington and is settling down to work with the second George W. Bush administration.

 Haider has played an important role in Track II diplomacy with Pakistan since retirement. He has the credentials, but many in the establishment see him as too much of a dove to be a tough negotiator.

 Dasgupta, a former ambassador to China, could take up India?s sensitive negotiations with Beijing from where Dixit left. But he lacks the standing of the other two.

 Lamba is a Dixit prot?g? and was held in regard, too, by the country?s first national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra. Like Dasgupta, however, he is a relative lightweight.

 The national security adviser?s post was created by the A.B. Vajpayee government and the first two appointees have been powerful men.

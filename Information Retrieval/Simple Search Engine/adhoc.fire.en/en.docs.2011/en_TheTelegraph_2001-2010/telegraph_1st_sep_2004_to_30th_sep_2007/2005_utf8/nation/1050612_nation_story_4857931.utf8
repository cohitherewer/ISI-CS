 Govt plan for judicial council

 Shimla: Union law minister H.R. Bhardwaj on Saturday said: The time has indeed come to make judges accountable to the people. 

 He was speaking at the conclusion of a two-day brainstorming session with state law ministers, secretaries and top law officials here, reports our correspondent.

 A judicial council, comprising top judges in the country, is being set up on how to make judges more accountable to the public, besides looking into corruption and nepotism charges being levelled against them from time to time, Bharadwaj said. Calling it the Shimla Declaration, he said the council will work on judicial reforms.

 In order to clear the backlog of pending cases, we are establishing and financing 1,500 trial courts across the country. We have decided to add 1,500 magistrate courts as well, he said.

 The conference also discussed the need for the upgrade of judicial infrastructure by extensively computerising courts to speed up disposal of cases.

 At the meeting it was agreed that we need more judges as there are still vacant posts at all levels. This, despite a record 135 judges being appointed last year alone in high courts and five in the Supreme Court, the Union minister said. 

 Jail raid yields SIM cards

 Gwalior (PTI): Ten SIM cards, two knives and audio cassettes were among the several items seized from the central jail here during a raid conducted by administrative and police officials on Saturday.

 The raid was carried out following complaints of threats being issued to some influential persons from the jail premises, said district collector Rakesh Shrivastava who led the raid along with superintendent of police M.S. Narang.

 Some of the SIM cards were found on the inmates while the others were hidden in their belongings. However, no mobile phones have been seized. 

 Dry fruits and letters were also seized, he said, adding that the prisoners were also found to have expensive clothes. Investigations were on to find out how the inmates got these clothes. 

 Lab tests on dead tigress 

 Jaipur (PTI): The viscera of the lone tigress that roamed Bharatpurs Keoladeo national park has been sent to Dehra Dun for laboratory tests to ascertain the cause of its death, said Rajasthan forest and wildlife minister L.N. Dave.

 A preliminary post-mortem report has indicated that the animal had died of a disease or snakebite and was not killed by poachers. A sample of the viscera was also being examined by forensic experts here. The carcass was spotted on Friday by passersby in the Ghana sanctuary.

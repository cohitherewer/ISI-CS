 Temple of love for wife

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, July 23: The three-room temple in a village near Hyderabad is no Taj Mahal, but as a labour of love, it is no less. 

 A 60-year-old farmer from Karimnagar district has built the temple as a monument to his dead wife, with whom he spent 40 years. Sulakshmi died three years ago. 

 I was unable to live without her physical presence around me. Hence I built this small temple, Garla Boddanna was quoted as saying in a Telugu weekly last week. 

 It came up in February-March this year.

 The temple on his five-acre farm is a simple three-room construction with a large courtyard and gardens. 

 Inside, a plaster of paris idol of Sulakshmi sits majestically with portraits of goddesses and gods looking down from the walls. 

 I have made my wife the deity of this temple. She is more than a goddess to me, Boddanna said.

 On Sulakshmis third death anniversary earlier this month, ministers and legislators were among the guests at a community meal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 A-I takes off for London

 AMIT ROY 

 London, June 17: Air-Indias first non-stop service from Calcutta to London should land at Heathrow just after 8 pm tomorrow, signalling an historic day in the airlines history.

 This service is very important for us, said Captain Ashvini Sharma, regional director (UK). 

 Between British Airways and Air-India, there will now be a daily service between Calcutta and London, which will have the effect of forcing fares down quite substantially.

 For the inaugural flight, Air-India is operating a recently leased aircraft, which will fly back to Calcutta tomorrow evening and then go on to Dhaka, the starting point for the service.

 Tomorrows guests on board will include a 40-strong media party, which will be accompanied by two Air-India directors Jitender Bhargava and Amod Sharma. The party will return on Tuesday night, after enjoying a bit of sightseeing in London plus a possible outing to see the musical, The Far Pavilions.

 India is booming, said Sharma. We want to provide better connectivity to all parts of India. This (the direct flights to Calcutta) will help to bring in more business and tourist traffic into the eastern part of India. 

 Last year, Air-India began a direct service between Heathrow and Ahmedabad to cater to the large Gujarati population in Britain. This was followed by a direct service between Birmingham, which has a big Punjabi population, and Amritsar. Both services are already over-subscribed. 

 Sharma would not be drawn into predicting the level of fares to Calcutta. Our fares are very competitive, was all he was prepared to say today. But with so many airlines coming in, fares are bound to be good for passengers. 

 For the flight to Calcutta, Air-India has an introductory return fare this month of ?300. To this has to be added tax of about ?70. 

 Fares are traditionally highest in December, just before Christmas, when BA has got away with charging ?750 in the past. Airline sources are suggesting this could come down to around ?475 in the future.

 Cabin crew operating from Calcutta should learn to be more culturally sensitive and use the appropriate Bengali words and dialect, if the experience of a recent passenger on a British Airways flight, Prithvi Narayan Chaudhuri, is any guide. 

 The cabin steward, who was from Bangladesh, referred to breakfast as nasta and to jal (water) as pani, said an irritated Chaudhuri, who protested this jarred with him. 

 And this on a flight which originated from Calcutta, not from Dhaka. 

 Had we referred to nasta at home, my father would have turned us out, added Chaudhuri, who is the youngest son of the late Nirad C. Chaudhuri and is among the thousands of Indians who have flocked to London to escape the heat of the Indian summer.

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: CPM politburo and central committee meetings this weekend are likely to be a show of support for Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has sparked a debate on economic policy during his recent trip abroad.

 The chief minister is expected to place before the politburo and the central committee details of the deal he has recently struck with the Salim Group and perhaps explain some of his pro-reform statements.

 However, the CPM leadership seems to have already made up its mind and decided not to create trouble for Bhattacharjee who has made it clear that he has no intention of backing off.

 The first public expression of disquiet from within the CPM has come, ironically, from Jyoti Basu who during his long tenure as chief minister had tried to woo private and foreign investment but not as aggressively as his successor.

 Most senior CPM leaders in Delhi vouch for Bhattacharjee and say he has not wavered from the economic framework laid down by the CPM. The chief minister has done nothing which is not in line with the partys policies, politburo member Sitaram Yechury has said.

 Yechury has defended Bhattacharjees deal with the Salim Group and warded off criticism about agricultural land being handed to industrialists. The land that is being given is not agricultural land. It is arid land where there is not much scope for cultivation, said Yechury.

 Nilotpal Basu, an MP and central committee member, today said: We want the chief minister to continue. His recent visit to Singapore was highly successful.

 At the meetings, Bhattacharjee is likely to clear some of the confusion his statements have triggered.

 The chief ministers remark that he is agreeable to even 100 per cent private investment in new airports, which came in the backdrop of his party opposing privatisation of airports at the Centre, has sparked a controversy.

 The CPM leadership in Delhi clarified that Bhattacharjee was talking about new airports and had in mind a second airport in Calcutta.

 Bhattacharjee may not have diverted from his partys policy line but his unbridled pro-reform statements are in contrast with the central leaderships opposition to a majority of economic policies mooted by the Centre.

 Senior CPM leaders believe Bhattacharjee has to tone up the Bengal economy and this is an issue on which the party can run its election campaign next year.

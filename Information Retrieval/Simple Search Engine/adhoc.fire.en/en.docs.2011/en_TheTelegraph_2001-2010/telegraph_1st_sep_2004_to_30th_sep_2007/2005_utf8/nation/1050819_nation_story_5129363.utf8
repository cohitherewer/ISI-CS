The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Road rage takes 8.5 lakh lives 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 18: Every six minutes, one Indian dies in a road accident. Injuries kill more than 8.5 lakh people in the country every year and send 1.65 crore to hospitals, filling 30 per cent of their beds.

 The nation loses Rs 55,000 crore ? 3 per cent of its GDP (gross domestic product) ? directly or indirectly because of injuries.

 These figures, obtained by the government through countrywide studies, will occupy the minds of members of the Neurotrauma Society of India over the next few days. Its conference ? which starts tomorrow at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute ? will try to work out a national policy for preventing injuries and saving lives.

 Head injuries are the leading cause of death in accidents, said neurosurgeon G.K. Prusty, the organising secretary of Neurotrauma 2005. More than 70 per cent of traffic accidents cause head injury. Its time we found a way of avoiding the deaths that occur on streets in Calcutta and other parts of the country.

 In Calcutta, 35 to 40 people die from injuries every month, most of them from road accidents.

 The conference will draw 300 participants ? including neuroscientists, government officials, traffic management experts, police officers, lawyers and safety engineers ? who will draw up a blueprint for road safety and hand it to the government.

 The meeting will discuss all aspects of injuries and their prevention, from the compulsory use of helmets to better and prompter care for the wounded.

 Banibrata Basu, former joint commissioner of police (traffic) and an invitee to the conference, said there are many loopholes in the way accident cases are handled in the city.

 A study by the city police found that quite often, accident victims are not taken to the nearest hospital. In certain instances, private hospitals have refused to admit patients, said Basu, who is now inspector-general of police with the CID.

 Experts estimate that by 2020, deaths from injury will emerge the third leading cause of death in the country. 

 Rapid urbanisation and the sharp rise in the number of cars has worsened the problem, said neurosurgeon Manoj Bhattacharya, former dean (medical faculty) of Calcutta University.

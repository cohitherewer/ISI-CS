 Closure axe on plant

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 2: The Orissa State Pollution Control Board (OPCB) has ordered immediate closure of the three major units of Oswal Chemical and Fertiliser Plant in Paradip for polluting the environment of the area.

 In a letter to Oswal chairman Abhey Oswal and senior general manager L. Paul on January 28, the board asked them to close the sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and di-ammonium phosphate units till further orders. 

 OPCB chairman Lalit Patnaik has said the units would have to be shut down under Section 31(A) of Air (prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1981 and Section 33(A) of Water (prevention and control) Act, 1974. He has also asked the Jagatsinghpur collector to ensure that the units are closed down within seven days.

 The closure order comes after a joint visit by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and OPCB in December last year. Earlier in November, residents of Mahakalpada and Rajnagar blocks in Kendrapara district had complained of damage to paddy due to leakage of gas from the plant. 

 Paradip Port Trust has been asked not to import or export any produce or raw material of the plant. 

 A parliamentary standing committee team headed by P.G. Narayanan would visit the plant tomorrow to verify the allegations against the company.

 Patna, March 27: Amid claims of police tightening the screws on criminals across Bihar, at least 11 people were killed and more than two dozen injured during Holi celebrations in the state.

 A day after the festival of colour, director-general of police Narayan Mishra said at least 15,000 wanted criminals have so far been arrested and sent to jail. Of them, at least 500 are on the ?most wanted? list, he added. 

 ?But unfortunately, five to six thousand new warrants of arrests are issued every week, even as we make that many arrests a week. Thus, it has become a perennial process for us,? Mishra said.

 Patna police alone claimed to have arrested about 800 wanted criminals so far. No major crime has been reported in Patna district, where 50 police stations have been under the scanner due to their ?sensitive? nature. The police did not make any major arrests either from the district.

 In a significant catch, Khagaria police arrested notorious criminals Munna Yadav, Ashok Paswan and Thethar Paswan of Alauli village.

 Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam held that the overall law and order situation in the capital has improved. ?A free atmosphere has developed in the capital with the improvement of general law and order. People feel rather relieved and are confident, thanks to the positive role of the police,? he said.

 While the police talk of arrests and an improved law an order situation, violence marred Holi festivities in Patna, with group clashes and explosions leaving at least two killed and half-a-dozen injured in and around the capital.

 Narmadeshwar of Koro village under Phulwari Sharif police station was killed and three others injured when a bomb exploded during a clash between two groups.

 Raju, who worked at a garage at Bahadur Housing Colony under Agam Kuan police station, was killed in another clash.

 Firing and an explosion in Shastri Nagar station area left Ramdev and Sunil Choudhary injured last night. Mallu Choudhary, a local criminal who evaded the police for quite some time, was believed to be behind the crime. 

 In another incident, a group of criminals allegedly robbed city resident Ratnesh Kumar of his motorcycle and Rs 1,200 from the Bypass in the Kankarbag area. 

 Reports of violence came in from other parts of the state as well. Three residents of Vishrampur village under Dinara police station in Rohtas district were killed during a dispute on Friday night. Tension still prevails in the area, a source said from Sasaram, the district headquarters.

 Reports of violence have come in from Siwan, Khagaria, Bhagalpur, Banka, Nawada and Vaishali districts as well.

 Anil Kumar of Belaha and Kapildev Mandal of Rajaun, both in Banka, were killed in Holi-related clashes. Two men of Pachouli village under Pachrukhi police station in Siwan were killed following an altercation over the use of colours.

 An exchange of fire between two inebriated men at Babbarganj village in Bhagalpur resulted in the death of one, a source said. Another person was stabbed to death at Warsaliganj in Nawada.

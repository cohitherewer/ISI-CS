 Reddy sweeps TRS amp; Naidu aside

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 26: YSR romped home without a crutch but rival Chandrababu Naidu looks in desperate need of one.

 The Andhra civic polls today threw up Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy as the big winner, with the Congress making a sweep of 74 of the 96 municipalities to which elections were held.

 The victory came in spite of the heat and dust raised by one-time ally Telengana Rashtra Samiti, which walked out of YSRs ministry in June and has been threatening to spill blood if a Telengana state is not carved out.

 It is a fitting reply to the antics and tantrums of Telengana campaigners, state Congress chief K. Keshav Rai said, making it clear the party was not the loser for splitting with the TRS.

 A flash of lightning seemed to have struck the TRS, which had expected to win at least 15 municipalities in the Telengana region but managed only two.

 We dont know what struck us. Like an attack of lightning, all our candidates were felled, TRS ideologue Jayashankar said.

 Chief minister Reddy, who seemed to have secured his throne in spite of the Telengana tangle, said the poll outcome proved two things. One, it is the peoples mandate for the massive irrigation works launched by the government.

 Two, the people have faith in the leadership of Sonia Gandhi to resolve the Telengana issue.

 He said the Congresss tie-up with Left parties had played a big role in trouncing the Telugu Desam as well the BJP. He even offered to support the TRS in municipalities where results were hung.

 The Desam won only in 10 municipalities in spite of a prolonged month-long campaign by its chief, Naidu. As he toured the flood-hit areas in Vijayawada today, he alleged the Congress had won with money and misuse of office.

 Although it seemed the Desam would have fared better with help from the BJP, party leader T. Devender Gowd said there was no question of rebuilding bridges with that party. 

 Come what may, we do not want the company of the BJP, he said.

 Experts say the opposition performance ? the Desam and BJP contested separately ? suggests the parties should review their relations if they are to prove any contest for the ruling Congress or win the confidence of the people of Andhra.

 It also takes the wind out of the Desam argument that it bombed at the 2004 hustings because of the tie-up with the BJP. Without it too, the Desam has bitten the dust.

 People are vexed with the Ram mandir issue, so they voted against the BJP and the Desam, which was once its ally, said a political analyst Nageswar over television.

 Naidus failure is his over-dependence on womens votes. Since he does not have NTRs charm, they didnt vote for him.

 A senior Congress minister, K. Rosaiah, said the results showed that not just farmers, even women, youth, the middle classes and urban people favour the YSR regime against the Naidu regime.

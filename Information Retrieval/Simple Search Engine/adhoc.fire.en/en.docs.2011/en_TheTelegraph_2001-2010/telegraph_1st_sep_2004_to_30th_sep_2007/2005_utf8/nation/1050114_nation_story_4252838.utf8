Mumbai, Jan. 13: A metropolitan court granted bail to film producer K.C. Bokadia today, a day after remanding him in judicial custody in connection with a bounced cheque, reports our correspondent. 

 Bokadia was arrested by Versova police on an arrest warrant issued by the Andheri metropolitan court. The warrant followed a complaint from a businessman that Bokadia had not honoured a cheque payment of Rs 7 lakh. 

 The metropolitan magistrate yesterday remanded Bokadia in judicial custody till January 27. But the producer then applied for bail before him and got it on a bond of Rs 20,000.

 Bokadia has produced films like the Mithun Chakravarty-starrer Pyar Jhukta Nahin, Amitabh Bachchan-starrers Aaj Ka Arjun and Lal Badshah, and the Shahrukh-Salman-Madhuri Dixit-starrer Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam.

 Alva post faces shuffle threat 

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: Congress general secretary Margaret Alva may be the loser in the tussle between Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and state party president Prabha Rau.

 The post-organisational poll revamp of the All India Congress Committee, which will take place soon, may see party chief Sonia Gandhi at least divest Alva of the charge of Maharashtra affairs even if she is retained as a general secretary.

 Alva and Rau have been accused by sections of the state and Mumbai Congress, including those known to be close to the chief minister, of collecting money while constituting the state executive recently. One of the members of the new executive is alleged to be a liquor baron and hardly qualified for the position.

 Alva has been under fire from sections of the state unit for several months. The general secretarys critics in the Maharashtra Congress believe, she is too aligned with Rau to have adopted objective criteria while giving her nod for the state partys executive body.

 Sonia held a meeting with Alva and Rau on Thursday, upon receiving the complaints. 

 The two leaders later dismissed allegations of collecting funds. However, their detractors are not likely to ease the pressure and would like both to go.

 There are indications that Sonia might at least take away the Maharashtra charge from Alva in the shuffle and give it to someone who would be more even-handed, even if she takes a decision in favour of her continuation as a general secretary.

 Sonia, sources said, is dissatisfied with the growing rift between the organisation wing led by Rau and the government wing led by Deshmukh. 

 Recently, Sonia had bridged a government-organisation divide in Punjab through a change of guard in the organisation wing. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee is looking after Punjab affairs.

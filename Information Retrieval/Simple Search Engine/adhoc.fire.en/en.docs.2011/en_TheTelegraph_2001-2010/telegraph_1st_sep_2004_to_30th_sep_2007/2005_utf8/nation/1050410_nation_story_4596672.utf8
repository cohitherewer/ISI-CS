 Fodder foul play, but in TN

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, April 9: Fodder has moved beyond Bihar to the south of the Vindhyas as the centre of controversy.

 Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav has for some years now been embroiled in a fodder scam. 

 Now, the public accounts committee of the Tamil Nadu Assembly has pulled up the state administration for its casual approach to implementing a fodder production programme meant to help Adi Dravidars (Dalits), nearly 17 years after the scheme went haywire.

 The scheme sanctioned in 1988 was meant to help 300 Adi Dravidar families in Thanjavur district to improve their income. 

 It envisaged erection of two borewells with motor pumpsets and electrification facilities to help grow fodder for the families having cows.

 However, the Tamil Nadu Adi Dravidar Development Corporation, the coordinating agency for the implementation of welfare programmes for Dalits and tribals in the state, did not release the initial fund of Rs 2 lakh sanctioned for this programme.

 The report of the public accounts panel tabled in the Assembly last week shows that the animal husbandry and fisheries department got the money from a World Bank scheme being implemented in the state as the Adi Dravidar development body did not allot the funds.

 But several tasks under the programme, such as the construction of a pump room and the purchase of a submersible motor, could not be undertaken as the department found that the money was ?sufficient for digging only one borewell?. 

 The department used the lack of resources to justify the bringing of ?only 15 acres? under fodder cultivation benefiting only 38 Adi Dravidar families.

 Fodder cultivation started in 1990, according to the panel?s report. The fodder was then distributed to 38 Dalit families in the area ? against the targeted 300 ? who had got loans through cooperative societies for buying milch animals.

 After 1992, even these few Adi Dravidars did not come forward to take the fodder, as they had by then sold the milch animals, which were meant to enhance their incomes. 

 The fodder is, thus, being ?sold to all categories of people who come forward? to purchase it and a ?common register is maintained?, the animal husbandry department told the accounts committee.

 The panel?s report points out that 10 years later ? in January 2003 ? the revenue department sanctioned funds for completing some ?pending items? of the project under the drought relief works programme, including the provision of a submersible motor.

 The animal husbandry department said the additional farm area, in which the second borewell had been sunk, was also available for growing fodder from June 2004. 

 It assured the public accounts panel that there would be enough fodder to supply to the Dalit families meant to benefit from the scheme and the public.

 However, the public accounts committee said, though 300 Adi Dravidar families were specifically targeted under the scheme, actual coverage was reduced to ?just 38 families and even they did not continue their vocation with the milch animals?. 

 This, the report said, is indicative of targets being ?fixed without proper basis and without in-depth study? on the ?inclination of the beneficiaries? of such schemes.

 The committee stopped short of recommending further action against officials of the animal husbandry department but said it ?desires the department to be more vigilant in future in identification of beneficiaries under such schemes and take adequate measures to sustain the beneficiaries in their allotted vocation?.

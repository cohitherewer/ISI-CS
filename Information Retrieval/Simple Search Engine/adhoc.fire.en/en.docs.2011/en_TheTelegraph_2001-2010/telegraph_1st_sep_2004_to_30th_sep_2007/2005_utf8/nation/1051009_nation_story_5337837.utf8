The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bound together by pain and prayers

 When the land hummed like a train 

 IMTIAZ GUL IN ISLAMABAD

 Ground zero: Telegraph correspondents 

 report from Islamabad and Baramulla 

 President Pervez 

 Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz visit the 

 site of the 10-storey building in Islamabad that collapsed 

 on Saturday. (AP) 

 I will never forget how the earth 

 growled. Thinking that something had gone wrong with the 

 steering or the wheels of the car, I pulled over to run 

 a check.

 Out of the car, I was dumbfounded: 

 the landscape around me, dotted with a few buildings and 

 surrounded by barbed wire, was rattling with a hum ? as 

 if a train were steaming past. 

 Only later would I learn that 

 Islamabad was tasting the aftermath of the severest earthquake 

 to strike Pakistans capital. 

 The strong tremors lasted almost 

 two minutes, and had within seconds forced thousands of 

 scared government employees out in the open space from ministry 

 buildings.

 Never before had I seen such crowds 

 outside private commercial plazas and government highrises; 

 people knelt down, most of them reciting verses from the 

 holy Quran, and looking up to the sky, as if asking for 

 Gods mercy.

 Even our two-storey building looked 

 like a doll house during some of the aftershocks, with my 

 wife spending most of the day out in the lawns.

 But the agony and the test of 

 our endurance of Mother Natures fury was longer than 

 expected. As many as 41 aftershocks ? measuring between 

 5 and 7.6 on the Richter scale ? kept rattling Islamabad 

 and Rawalpindi in the south. One of the tremors came as 

 late as 10 hours after the first.

 The worst, however, befell the 

 inhabitants of the high-rise Margala Towers, a 10-storey 

 apartment building that caved in during the first tremor, 

 trapping more than a hundred people.

 The scenes were quite harrowing, 

 with a young boy caught between two crumbled blocks from 

 the waist down and his relatives hugging him helplessly 

 till army commandos came to his rescue.

 By sunset, rescue teams were still 

 struggling to cut through the piled-up blocks to the dozens 

 of people stranded there.

 While President Pervez Musharraf, 

 who visited the site, said there might be 70-80 people still 

 trapped under the debris, interior minister Aftab Shepao 

 confirmed at least eight fatalities caused by the collapse 

 of the building, located in one of the affluent sectors 

 of Islamabad.

 It is a test for all of 

 us. It is a test for me, of the Prime Minister, of the government 

 and of the entire nation and I am sure we will succeed, 

 Musharraf said. 

 Experts questioned the quality 

 of construction material used in the building. 

 This is strange that some 

 buildings and flats which are as old as 25 years survived 

 the tremors but the tower that was constructed in the late 

 1990s could not, said Tahira Raza, an Islamabad-based 

 civil engineer.

 The earthquake spread chaos in 

 congested cities like Rawalpindi and Lahore, where early-morning 

 traffic was brought to a halt.

 People left their vehicles and 

 ran. I nearly lost control of the wheel as my car 

 began to swing, said Mohammad Iqbal, who was heading 

 to his office in Islamabad when the quake struck.

 Most of the fatalities occurred 

 in northern Pakistan and Muzaffarabad, capital of Azad Jammu 

 and Kashmir.

 According to Azad Jammu and Kashmir 

 officials, at least 250 people were killed after the quake 

 hit Muzaffarabad. Among other worst-hit regions in Azad 

 Kashmir were Balakot and Bagh districts as the tremors severely 

 damaged villages along the Karakoram Highway that links 

 Pakistan with China.

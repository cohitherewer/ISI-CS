 Finger at fossil fuels for global warming

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: On his computer screen, physicist Govindasamy Bala has caught glimpses of Earth in the 22nd century: the planet is eight degrees warmer than today, the Arctic ice disappears during summer, and the oceans are acidic.

 A scientist with the atmospheric science division at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in the US, Bala has been studying how Earths climate will change if the use of fossil fuels continues unabated in the centuries to come.

 Fossil fuel combustion spews heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that causes the planet to retain more heat from the sun and become warmer. Many studies have indicated that global warming will melt glaciers and polar ice caps and raise sea levels.

 Balas latest study, the results of which were published in the Journal of Climate yesterday, has shown that if the use of fossil fuels continues in a business as usual manner, the average global air temperature will be eight degrees warmer and the sea levels will rise by seven metres in another 300 years.

 The assumptions that underlie simulation studies drive results. Well need to critically analyse the assumptions for this study, said Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), an international body that has been assessing scientific data on climate change.

 In assessment reports, the IPCC itself has predicted a 1.4 to 5.4 degrees rise in average temperatures and up to 88 cm rise in the sea level by the year 2100. Even with such relatively lower levels of sea level rises, some studies have predicted inundation of islands and low-lying countries such as Bangladesh.

 Notwithstanding its 300-year span, the prediction from the LLNL study appears alarming to scientists.

 Bala used a computer-based model to simulate climate change as heat-trapping carbon dioxide spewed during fossil fuel burning rises in Earths atmosphere. 

 He said the most drastic changes will occur during the 22nd century. The model predicts that polar ice cover in the northern hemisphere will disappear almost completely during summers by 2150.

 Balas study predicted that in the business-as-usual scenario, the temperature will rise by 20 degrees Celsius in the polar regions, transforming the frigid landscape into boreal forests. It has predicted that the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels will rise from the present day 380 parts per million to 1,420 parts per million.

 Eventually, the carbon dioxide will enter the ocean and turn the seas acidic, threatening marine organisms.

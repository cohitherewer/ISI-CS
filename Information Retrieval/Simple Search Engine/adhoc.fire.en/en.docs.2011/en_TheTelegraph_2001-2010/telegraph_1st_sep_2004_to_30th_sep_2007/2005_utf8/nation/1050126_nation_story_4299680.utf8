The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bhutan prince in Delhi for lessons

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: Bhutan Crown Prince Chhoetse Penlop Jigme Khesar Nangyal Wangchuk is attending a 12-month intensive course on security concepts at the National Defence College here. 

 It is aimed at helping him prepare to take over the responsibility of the land-locked Himalayan kingdom when the time comes for him to step into his father?s shoes.

 Brigadier Prakash Menon, the course in-charge, refused to speak about the star student who joined on January 10, quoting security reasons. ?We want to keep this extremely low key for security reasons.?

 Over the last two years, the prince has been taking a keen interest in every aspect of Bhutan?s administration. He has been travelling with King Jigme Singye Wangchuk to far-flung villages and watching his father?s interaction with his subjects.

 The crown prince is the first member of the Bhutanese royalty to attend a course in the defence college.

 Bhutan has not fought a war for over 130 years but was forced to take action against Northeast militants in December 2003. Operation Pushback, against Ulfa and other insurgent groups, led to increased security concerns for the crown prince. 

 The National Defence College is one of India?s premier institutions and is modelled on London?s Royal College of Defence Studies. It seeks to comprehend and interpret the dynamics of India?s security strategy in a changing world.

 The section on international security focuses on geo-political and geo-strategic concepts, the global security environment and its relevance to India as well as international relations and India?s foreign policy. There is an attempt to understand the role of powerful nations like the US, China, Russia, France, the UK as well as the European Union and Japan in international politics. Nuclear issues, the role of the Indian defence forces in the 21st century and India?s defence and internal security all form part of the course. 

 By the end of the course, the crown prince will have an overall understanding of India?s security interests. For the future monarch, this would be extremely useful.

 Bhutan is one of India?s closest allies and bilateral ties have always been excellent. Bhutan is about the only neighbouring country where allegations of Indian high-handedness are not heard. This is perhaps because Delhi has over the years taken care not to tread on Bhutanese sensitivities.

 The King of Bhutan is the chief guest at tomorrow?s Republic Day celebrations.

 Manipur gets a respite

 Kohima/Imphal, Aug. 10: Manipurs choked supply lines will breathe freely again from noon tomorrow, but the respite could be short.

 The All Naga Students Association of Manipur, which has been holding the state to ransom since midnight on June 19, said today appeals by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and various student organisations of the Northeast prompted it to temporarily lift the blockade on the national highways 39 and 53. 

 The Naga Students Federation, which has been supporting the agitation, was party to the announcement.

 NSF president Phushika Aomi and his ANSAM counterpart Paul Languh said in a joint statement that the decision to relax the blockade was taken in consultation with the Naga Hoho and other Naga organisations. 

 The duo said Naga outfits would resume the agitation if the Manipur government did not fulfil their demand.

 The highway blockade is in protest against the Manipur governments decision to observe the anniversary of the 2001 June uprising in the valley as state integrity day. 

 The uprising was against Delhis bid to extend its ceasefire with the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) to Manipur and other Northeast states . 

 Naga outfits believe legitimising that agitation is tantamount to challenging their goal to integrate all Naga-inhabited areas of the region.

 Naga student leaders said they understood how much residents of Manipur had suffered because of the blockade, but had been compelled to continue the agitation. 

 The decision to lift the blockade, even though temporarily, was in deference to requests by the Prime Minister and Union home minister Shivraj Patil when a Naga Hoho delegation met them in New Delhi, they said. 

 The delegation included representatives of the United Naga Council and Lok Sabha member Mani Charenamei, who represents Outer Manipur constituency in Parliament.

 Languh said Ibobis invitation to the Naga student leadership for further talks on the contentious issue was another reason for lifting the blockade.

 In Imphal, smiling faces replaced creased brows as news of the development trickled in. Ibobi was unavailable for comment, leaving power minister Gaikhangam to make an official statement. He described the Naga student organisations announcement as a good gesture. 

 Prices of all commodities have surged over the past month because of the blockade. Petrol is being sold at Rs 70 per litre and an LPG cylinder costs anything between Rs 700 and Rs 1,000.

 The Ibobi government had reopened NH 53 (Imphal-Silchar) after repairs exactly a month after the blockade began, but failed to make it an alternative lifeline. Saboteurs suspected to be from the NSCN (I-M) damaged a suspension bridge along the route the very day it was opened. 

 Indian Air Force planes airlifted 40 tonnes of goods from Guwahati to Imphal on August 6.

 Rebel truths from YSR

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reddy: Firm stand

 New Delhi, May 17: Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has conceded that his governments healing touch approach towards Naxalites indirectly helped them regroup and rearm.

 To some extent, it is true that our governments policy has helped Naxalite groups, the chief minister said, when his attention was drawn to mounting violence in the state after peace talks with top rebel leaders last July.

 At a news conference today to mark the completion of his first year in office, Reddy, however, said the state would not give up its efforts to reach out to the prodigal sons for a peaceful solution.

 While the government would continue to try to persuade Naxalite groups to lay down arms and resume talks, he said, police would deal with any violence. It is also our responsibility to maintain law and order and the police will do the needful.

 Reddy appeared ill at ease when asked about farmers suicides ? an issue the Congress had turned into an election campaign against the Telugu Desam Party last year. The chief minister hoped his governments schemes of free power, subsidised farm credit, insurance cover for borewell digging and focus on strengthening self-help groups in the rural areas would help. 

 Things could also get better with the government stepping up work on many unfinished irrigation projects by pumping in more money. 

 Asked about the lack of necessary central clearance for some of the projects, Reddy said: This is nothing new. Even three years after the completion of the controversial Alamatti project in neighbouring Karnataka, it has yet to get all necessary clearance for the project.

 On ally Telengana Rashtra Samitis demand for the creation of Telengana, the chief minister said it was before a three-member committee headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee.

 Before last years elections, the allies had agreed on setting up a second states reorganisation commission to decide on the statehood demand. 

 But it was the TRS which preferred to decide the demand through consensus when the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance was finalised last year, the chief minister said. 

 Asked if the TRS could join hands with the BJP on the Telengana issue, Reddy said he could not comment on what would happen in future. 

 With the Telugu Desam Party gradually distancing itself from the NDA, the BJP state unit has been dropping hints about its intentions to revive the Telengana demand.

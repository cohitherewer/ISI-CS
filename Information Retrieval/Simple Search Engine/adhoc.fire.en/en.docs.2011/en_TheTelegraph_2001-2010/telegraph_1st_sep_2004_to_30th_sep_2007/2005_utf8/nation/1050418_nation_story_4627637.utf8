 Doctors? Advani ache

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, April 17: Even 

 as Indo-Pak bonhomie is ascending commanding heights of 

 South Asian diplomacy, L.K. Advani is quietly continuing 

 his policy of hot pursuit of the ?enemy? beyond Indian borders.

 The BJP leader ? albeit unintentionally ? has split the very first and the most high profile organisation of Pakistanis in the US, the Association of Pakistani Physicians of North America (Appna).

 The association, which has been on the frontlines of all American initiatives on Pakistan, including the campaign for the recent F-16 planes to Pakistan, is mired in controversy following its award of a plaque of appreciation to Advani.

 The plaque was given to Advani during the visit of a 250-strong Appna delegation of Pakistani-American doctors to India as part of the goodwill that is now overwhelming relations between India and Pakistan at all levels.

 Angry members of Appna are now demanding that its president, Hussain Malik, who led the delegation, should resign. Typical of the furore within Appna is an advertisement in a Pakistani-American Urdu newspaper in New York that has been taken out by some members of the association.

 Its text accuses Malik without mincing words: ?You have disgraced not only yourself, but the Appna membership and Muslims at large. We wish you could comprehend the gravity of the blunder you and your cronies have committed.?

 Malik has now apologised to Appna members. He is also under fire for having adopted an Indian village during the delegation?s visit.

 Malik?s successor-elect, who will head Appna in 2006, Abdul Rashid Piracha, said in an e-mail to its members: ?I personally see the honour plaque to Mr L.K. Advani from Appna as a grave affront to my being a Pakistani and a Muslim. 

 ?I don?t need to elaborate on the genocide that Mr Advani and his vicious cohorts have repeatedly inflicted upon the Muslims in India. 

 ?For Appna to present him with an honour plaque amounts to its losing sight of every grain of national dignity and personal self-respect.? 

 ?The so-called peace overtures between India and Pakistan, as appealing as they are, should not be carried out at the cost of sacrificing our souls and national sensibilities,? according to Piracha?s web communication, which has been acquired by South Asia Tribune a Pakistani-American web newspaper here.

 According to the Tribune, the main organiser of the trip was Rizwan Naeem, who has been described as the son-in-law of Najma Heptullah, the former deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, who recently joined the BJP.

 Other accounts in the Pakistani media have said the government of Pakistan arranged the trip as part of efforts to boost people-to-people contacts between India and Pakistan.

 Heptullah?s son-in-law has now left Appna?s president in the lurch and apologised for his role in the episode.

 ?I want to start with a clear message that it was a decision of poor choice without consensus,? Naeem said in an e-mail to Appna members of the decision to honour Advani. 

 ?Giving a plaque will never negate Mr Advani?s past. As a member of the organising committee, I wish to apologise to the members for the hurt sentiments.?

 Pakistanis here are watching where Appna will go from here, but for Indian-Americans, the split in a leading lobbying front for Islamabad?s causes is a windfall at a time when Indian lobbying is falling short in the US.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The forthcoming Bihar Assembly elections will see an unprecedented deployment of security forces.

 The home ministry, in consultation with the Election Commission, has decided to deploy 453 companies of central police forces and 147 companies of state police forces following intelligence reports that the four-phase elections could even witness the murder of contestants. This means 75,000 security personnel will be deployed to guard 57,363 booths.

 Of the 453 companies of central forces, the BSF will contribute 175, CRPF 163, ITBP 10, CISF 100 and the SSB five companies. About a dozen states will contribute personnel for the other 147 companies. The home ministry has decided to give the coordination command of all the 600 companies to the CRPF as it is well versed with Bihars terrain and the modus operandi of Naxalites.

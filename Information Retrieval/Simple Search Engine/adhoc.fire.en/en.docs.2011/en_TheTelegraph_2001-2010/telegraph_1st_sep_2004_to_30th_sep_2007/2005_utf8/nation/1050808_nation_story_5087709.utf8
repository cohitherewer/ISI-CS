 Sugar mill pact goes sour

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulayam: Plans upset

 Lucknow, Aug. 7: The Uttar Pradesh government and Amar Singh, in particular, have suffered a blow with a top sugar producer dropping plans to take over 24 sick mills in the state.

 Bajaj Hindustan, in talks with the Amar Singh-headed Uttar Pradesh Development Council since 2003 to take these mills on lease, informed it early last month that it was no longer interested. 

 The company owned by Shishir Bajaj, younger brother of industrialist Rahul Bajaj, also requested the Mulayam Singh Yadav government to return the Rs 5 crore deposited as part of a deal to negotiate the lease. 

 State chief secretary Neera Yadav this week directed the finance department to clear the repayment.

 This is a blow to the government which has been trying to woo big business to the state, particularly in the energy and sugar sectors. 

 They (Bajaj) are off. This means that the state government will have to start again its search for a company that may be willing to take these mills on lease, said P.N. Bathan, special secretary, department of sugarcane.

 The proposal to hand over the mills to the Bajaj company for Rs 48 crore ? which would have made it the top player in the state, ahead of the K.K. Birla group ? had sparked loud protests from the Opposition, which said it was a sellout and smelt a rat.

 Since taking the mills out of private hands in 1993, the state government has spent Rs 1,200 crore on upgrading them. The annual financial burden to operate the mills is around Rs 500 crore, sources said.

 The Bajaj company, which owns five sugar mills in the state, cited delay in finalising the deal and lack of clarity as reasons for backing out. But Singh, who is also general secretary of the Samajwadi Party, blamed the Opposition and a section of the media.

 When I had begun the negotiations way back in 2003, some of my political adversaries and a section of media launched a campaign against me saying that I had cut a deal to get Rs 5 crore from the Bajajs, he said at a programme on Monday. That is how the process got derailed.

 But it was not the Opposition alone that had objected. Even the Rashtriya Lok Dal, a Samajwadi Party ally which has a big stake in sugarcane politics, was against handing over all 24 mills to one entity.

 The importance of sugar in Uttar Pradesh politics was reflected in Rahul Gandhis choice of subject for his maiden speech in Parliament. The Amethi MP whom the state Congress sees as its saviour raised the issue of non-payment of dues to farmers by private sugar mill owners in his March address. 

 Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav will make a statement in the Assembly tomorrow, targeting the Opposition for the deal falling through. 

 The letter to the state government from the chief executive of Bajaj Hindustan, Kushagraha Bajaj, had, however, blamed lack of clarity in settling the deal for the pullout. 

 The Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction had cleared the deal only after the state government in January agreed to conditions it laid down with regard to voluntary retirement scheme for workers, conversion of state loan into capital for the mills etc. The matter had gone before the appellate authority after BIFR rejected the states proposal to hand over the mills to one business group.

 The Bajaj company said it proposes to invest Rs 750 crore in the states sugar sector in the next five years. We thought it better to open new mills rather than take on lease the old ones beset with undesirable burden, a spokesperson said.

 Clinics at hand for jawans

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: A Central Reserve Police Force jawan injured in an ambush will no longer have to travel hundreds of miles for admission to the forces own hospital.

 Under a recent home ministry order, he ? or his family ? can be treated at any central police force (CPF) hospital, even if it is run by a different force, such as the Border Security Force or the Indo-Tibetan Border Police.

 The move is one of the first steps the government has taken in acknowledgement of the harsh and stressful conditions under which central police forces function.

 The home ministry has devised a medical card on the lines of the Central Government Health Services card that these paramilitary jawans and their families can use. The cards will be issued by the parent force with the family photographs attested on it for easy identification and convenience.

 The CPF healthcare system will also be extended to civilians in far-flung areas where there are no government-run medical centres.

 The home ministry note forwarded to all central police forces admits that there is considerable stress on paramilitary personnel because of long hours of duties in inhospitable and hostile environment. Family problems at home caused by long absences also add to the stress, it says.

 More often than not, these results in suicide or firing incidents on fellow jawans, the note says. Being posted in remote areas, they are also exposed to various infections, diseases and other morbid conditions.

 A senior home ministry official said the order has great significance for the countrys eight-lakh-strong paramilitary forces and about 30 lakh family members dependent on them. 

 It will give great relief to jawans serving in different areas. Now, instead of losing precious time to go to their respective base hospitals or looking for costly private treatment, central police force personnel and their families would be able to get good treatment in 35 central police force hospitals spread across the country, the official added.

 Of the 35 hospitals, the BSF has nine, the CRPF 20 and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police three. Assam Rifles, the National Security Guard and the Sashastra Seema Bal have one each.

 Paswan ready to risk berth

 Paswan

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: To be or not to be with the ruling alliance in Delhi is not an option for Ram Vilas Paswan anymore.

 In his bid to project his alliance with the Samajwadi Party, the CPI and radical Left groups as a second secular front, the Lok Janshakti Party chief is ready to risk his ministerial berth at the Centre.

 Paswan had projected himself as kingmaker in the last Bihar elections. But his insistence on keeping equal distance from the UPA and the NDA had paved the way for Presidents rule in the state. Though he is still chanting the same mantra, he is trying to wean the Janata Dal (United) away from the BJP to join his secular alliance.

 His efforts find resonance among many leaders in the Dal (U). Several feel the BJP, especially after the embarrassing stand-off between the RSS and L.K. Advani, has become a liability in Bihar.

 It is not a bad idea to part ways with a liability and join a secular front which has the SP and the CPI, said a senior Dal (U) leader.

 Laloo is losing his base. People are flocking to the Nyay Yatra that we have been taking out in several parts of Bihar. In such a scenario, it will not hurt us to join hands with Ram Vilas, said another senior leader.

 The only hitch, Dal (U) sources said, was the partys chief ministerial candidate Nitish Kumars belief that its alliance with the BJP is still beneficial.

 Nitish made a strong statement in Parliament today against the BJPs opposition to reservations for Dalit Christians and minorities. Despite this, he completely ruled out parting ways with the BJP. We have ideological differences with the BJP. But we are alliance partners and will continue to remain so regardless of what anyone says.

 Paswans partners ? the Congress and Laloo Prasad Yadav ? are becoming increasingly restive at his antics. 

 Though the Congress, which fought the last polls with Paswan, maintains a facade of trying to get all secular forces on one platform, in reality, it would not mind a political front led by Laloo Prasad come down a few notches. Such a prospect is likely if all the UPA constituents do not fight the elections together.

 Laloo Prasad has made his irritation with Paswan clear. Nitish Kumar is like my younger brother. We have fought several battles together. Paswan is an opportunist.

 Cop guard in net over scam

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 3: The personal security officer of former Orissa director-general of police N.C. Padhi today landed in the vigilance net for his involvement in the Orissa State Armed Police and India Reserve Battalion sepoy recruitment scam. 

 Vigilance sleuths have lodged a case against Chaitanya Kumar Jena, the PSO, on charges of collecting huge amounts of money and getting some candidates appointed as sepoys during recruitment. 

 Jena was found to be in possession of assets worth Rs 6.75 lakh ? found disproportionate to his known sources of income. 

 Incidentally, Jena?s boss N.C. Padhi had retired in August last year under a cloud of controversy over his role in a scam over recruitment of sepoys. 

 The recruitment scam came to light in 2003 following which the vigilance department registered five criminal cases against IPS officer Prafulla Mishra and others. 

 Mishra, as chairman of the Sepoy Recruitment Board for the India Reserve Battalion, was alleged to have shown undue favour to a few candidates.

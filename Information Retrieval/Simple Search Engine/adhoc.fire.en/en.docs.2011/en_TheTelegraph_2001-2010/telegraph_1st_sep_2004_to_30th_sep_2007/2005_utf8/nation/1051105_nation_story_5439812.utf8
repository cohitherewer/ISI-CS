 US tilt under fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: Foreign minister Natwar Singhs alleged involvement in the Iraq food-for-oil scandal has brought some of the so-called third front forces together. The Samajwadi Party has joined hands with the Left to attack the Centres pro-US foreign policy.

 While the CPI today came out in support of the foreign minister, the Samajwadi Party stopped short of that, questioning Singhs defence and asking for a probe to restore the dignity of the foreign office. It took the opportunity to lambast the Congress, saying the Paul Volcker report has created confusion about what the partys foreign policy is.

 The foreign affairs minister claims he is being targeted for being pro-Saddam. But before the Volcker report was made public, the UPA happily went and voted against Iran in (the) International Atomic Energy Agency at Americas behest, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh said.

 That reflects a clear foreign policy tilt towards the US. How can the Congress explain the two situations (being pro-Saddam and pro-US at the same time)? The Left and the Samajwadi Party have decided to expose the governments pro-US foreign policy.

 Singh said his party, along with the CPM, Janata Dal (Secular) and the RSP, will hold a maha rally in Lucknow on November 13 in protest against the Congress-led regimes anti-Iran and pro-US policy.

 The same evening, Singh added, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ? together with leaders of the Samajwadi Party, Janata Dal (Secular) and the RSP ? will issue a statement opposing the Centres foreign policy.

 Advice to Atal, suspense for the rest

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Uma: New innings?

 Bhopal, April 20: Inviting an ?out-of-work? Atal Bihari Vajpayee to join her in tapasya, Uma Bharti is keeping the BJP on tenterhooks.

 She has said her spiritual guru Swami Vishveshwar Tirtha would decide about her political career during a religious congregation at temple-town Amarkantak tomorrow. 

 Uma today took time off a yagna and prayers to issue a public appeal to the former Prime Minister, now at the centre of a storm in the parivar. 

 ?Atalji ke paas abhi koi kaam nahin hai. Mere paas bhi koi kaam nahin hai (Atalji does not have any work at present. I also have no work),? she said. ?Let Atalji come here and we both baap-beti will perform tapasya (meditation),? the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said.

 Sources claiming to be close to Uma said the mercurial sadhvi could announce ?retirement? from politics and embark upon a ?yatra? to cover a 1200-km-stretch around the Narmada river.

 Uma has been disillusioned with the central BJP leadership over its failure to reinstate her as Madhya Pradesh chief minister. Uma had quit office in August last year after a court in Karnataka ordered her arrest in an old case of communal violence. She has been acquitted since then. 

 Uma has been camping in Amarkantak for the last 12 days and avoided attending the BJP?s silver jubilee celebrations earlier this month. A prayer meet and a ?bhandara? (community meal) are scheduled for tomorrow. The event has been billed a big trial of strength between her supporters and those loyal to chief minister Babulal Gaur. 

 State BJP chief Kailash Joshi and organisation secretary Kaptan Singh Solanki have cautioned party MLAs against visiting Amarkantak. 

 Uma said Gaur is ?unnecessarily scared? of her presence. ?I have made it clear again and again that I am not after his chair. I do not understand why a religious ceremony is being perceived as a political event,? she said. 

 Uma added that there was nothing unusual to seek her guru Swami Vishveshwar Tirtha?s advice on whether to continue in politics. The swamiji, who hails from Udipi in Karnataka, has been having a decisive say in Uma?s personal and professional life for the last 13 years. 

 Endorsing RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan?s statement that there should be an age limit in politics, Uma said: ?I have been forced to retire at the age of 45. I wanted to go on a pilgrimage, but Advaniji asked me not to go. I have never asked for any post, but was hoping that I would be given some responsibility.

 ?But it did not happen. So I think maybe he wanted me to retire early,? she said.

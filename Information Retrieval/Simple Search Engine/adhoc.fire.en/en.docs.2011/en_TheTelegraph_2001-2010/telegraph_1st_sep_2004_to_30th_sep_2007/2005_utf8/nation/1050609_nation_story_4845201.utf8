 Death wire

 Hyderabad, June 8: Eleven passengers, including a 10-year-old boy, were electrocuted this morning in Kadapa, chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys native district, when the top of the bus they were travelling in came in contact with a high-tension wire.

 Police said flowers and vegetables heaped on top of the bus snapped the 11-kw power line in Ponnampally, about 416 km southwest of Hyderabad.

 A barefoot schoolboy was the first to die and he fell on two schoolteachers. Others who tried to save them were electrocuted too, district police superintendent V.C. Sajjannar said.

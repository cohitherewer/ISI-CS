 British party taps voters in temple

 AMIT ROY

 The Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, London

 London, Feb. 19: The large and influential Hindu community in Britain is upset by the Iraq war ? but perhaps not as much as the Muslims.

 This is the strong impression which emerged today after Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, visited the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, north London, and made a pitch for ethnic minority votes in the forthcoming British general elections.

 Since the Lib Dems, unlike Tony Blair?s Labour government or Michael Howard?s Tories, opposed the Iraq war from the very start, Kennedy may be justified in feeling that the votes of angry Muslims, who previously voted Labour, are in the bag. If he could get Hindus, too, to support the Lib Dems, his party could achieve the dream of displacing the Tories as the official Opposition. Or so he might reckon.

 Kennedy slightly offended orthodox Hindus by making an overtly political speech at a semi-religious function whose main purpose was to hand over ?more than half a million pounds? to the diplomatic representatives of the tsunami affected countries ? India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, the Maldives and Bangladesh.

 The money was distributed ?according to need?, explained a spokesperson, who said Hindu devotees stood in shopping centres with collection buckets and mobilised their network to raise the funds.

 Unlike senior members of the 1.5-million strong Muslim population in Britain, Hindus have been much more restrained when commenting on the Iraq war. For one thing, the more important of the one million Hindus tend to operate not as Hindus but as figures in the world of business, the arts, media and academia who just happen to be Hindu.

 In his speech, Kennedy, on his first visit to the temple ? Blair came once as Opposition leader and Howard when he was Tory home secretary ? hailed the benefits of multi-culturalism. He said: ?Labour can no longer lay exclusive claim to the votes of Britain?s ethnic minorities. Many people in Britain, of all races, cultures and religions, were angry about the way we were taken to war in Iraq. And they saw the principled stand the Liberal Democrats took at the time.? 

 Kennedy?s party has issued an election manifesto for ?black and minority ethnic communities?. He is seen as being more sympathetic than Howard who has made control of immigration and asylum seekers his priority. 

 When the manifesto was launched, Kennedy said: ?The reality of Britain today is that it is a multi-ethnic, multi-faith and therefore diverse society. It is a richer society as a result ? culturally, socially and economically. The Liberal Democrats embrace that Britain and we celebrate it. We would ensure that our laws reflect that diversity, protecting minorities from discrimination, from victimisation and harassment.?

 For the Liberal Democrats immigration offers us opportunities to enhance our economy and fill much needed skills gaps. Others talk about immigration as if it is an unregulated, unstoppable tide. When it comes to asylum, it?s true that we should find better ways of regulating the system.?

 The chances are more Hindus will vote Lib Dem this time but not enough to stop Blair returning as Prime Minister, almost certainly with a reduced majority. The Hindu business community, once comfortable with Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, realises that finance minister Gordon Brown has handled the economy reasonably well.

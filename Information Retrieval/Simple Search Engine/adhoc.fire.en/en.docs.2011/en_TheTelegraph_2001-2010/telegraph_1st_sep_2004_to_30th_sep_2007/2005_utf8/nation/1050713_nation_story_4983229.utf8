 Plea for Braille, sound road signs

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 12: Imagine roads where cars give the blind right of way, bus stops which have signposts in Braille or even conductors who behave decently and help them hop on.

 Thats what a blind man from Gurgaon has sounded the Supreme Court on and got a compassionate reply to.

 On Rajive Raturis petition that road construction norms should be amended to make them friendlier to the blind, the court has issued notices to the Centre, states and Union territories.

 Raturi contends that the blind have a tough time boarding buses or crossing roads because practically nothing on the roads is tailored to their needs.

 Bus stops do not have signs in Braille nor are there provisions for audio directions. Conductors not only disregard the handicap, they blatantly discriminate against them. This makes using public transport a virtual nightmare, though the blind are protected by the Persons with Disabilities (equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation) Act, 1995.

 The petition also comes down strongly on bad traffic management and indisciplined driving. Due to lack of effective traffic control and enforcement of laws to ensure discipline in and monitoring of private vehicles, blind persons are grappling with extremely unsafe and inaccessible roads, transport and public facilities, it says.

 Raturi has pleaded that corrective measures be taken on roads throughout the country and on a par with international standards.

 The notices were issued by a division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and G.P. Mathur. A reply has been sought from the ministry of social justice and empowerment and the ministry of surface transport.

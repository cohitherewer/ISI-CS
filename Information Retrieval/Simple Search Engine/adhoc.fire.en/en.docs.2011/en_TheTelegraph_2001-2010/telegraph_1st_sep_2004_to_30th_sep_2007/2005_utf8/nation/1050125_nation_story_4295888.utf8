 China talks take off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: The decade-old boundary dispute and other regional issues of importance came up for discussion at the first strategic dialogue between India and China.

 The visit of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to India, scheduled for March, was also one of the focus areas of discussion.

 Chinese vice-foreign minister Wu Dawei held detailed discussions with foreign secretary Shyam Saran and other senior South Block officials.

 The strategic dialogue ? the first of its kind between the two countries ? is a clear indication of how bilateral relations have been progressing over the past few years. But its importance also lies in reports coming out of Delhi in the past few weeks ? especially in the wake of national security adviser J.N. Dixit?s death, that Saran will in future be the main point man from India to deal with China.

 Indications are that Beijing was keen to find out about the Indian position from Saran on the border talks, which, according to sources, have now ?entered a critical phase?. 

 The Chinese side is keen to know what kind of a ?give-and-take? formula Delhi is willing to accept to ensure a speedy resolution of the border dispute.

 When asked whether the border issue came up for discussion, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna tried to play it down, saying, ?it is possible that as part of the general discussions, the issue may have come up.? But he pointed out that the boundary issue was being dealt with separately by special representatives of the two countries.

 Sarna said there was a ?broad convergence? of views on important regional and global issues between the two sides. ?Both sides also briefed each other on their respective foreign and security policies.?

 ?The two sides agreed to closely work together to ensure a substantive outcome of the visit, which is expected to mark a new phase in the relationship between the two countries.?

 The spokesperson said both sides were satisfied with the outcome of the discussions and felt that these have ?further increased their mutual trust and understanding.? Calling the strategic dialogue ?significant?, Sarna said this ?indicates the two sides? readiness to look at the bilateral relationship in a long-term and strategic perspective.? The next round of talks will be held in China, though the dates will be finalised by the two sides later.

 The Chinese delegation later met the foreign minister Natwar Singh. He told Wu and the other members that India was looking forward to the Chinese Premier?s visit as it would be a ?major event? in the bilateral relations between the two countries and lead to ?substantial results.?

 Cops in hunt for clues

 ASHISH SINHA

 Munger, Jan. 7: The picturesque and heavily-forested Bhimbandh region, where district superintendent of polive K.C. Surendra Babu was killed in a Naxalite-triggered landmine blast on Wednesday, saw fewer New Year revellers this time. 

 The reason was some pamphlets left behind by CPI (Maoist) rebels, who warned people against merrymaking.

 Police officials admitted that extremists have been active in the region for more than two years but their targeting Kajra railway station in adjoining Lakhisarai district came as a ?real surprise?.

 ?The fact that the SP had gone to the area for a combing operation shows that he anticipated rebel activity there. But we did not expect the attack to come in such a manner,? inspector-general of police R.R. Varma told The Telegraph.

 Police sources, however, said the real worry was that the expanse of the rebels? influence in the three districts ? Jamui, Munger and Lakhisarai, ? was not clearly known. ?We have reasons to believe that they (rebels) are adopting the Jharkhand pattern in this region also. Their stress is on coopting the villagers, even by force, and making them an active channel of their support system,? another police official said.

 The Naxalites are only beginning to spread their influence in the region and therefore, police sources said, the authorities have a long haul in the three districts. It is not only the area?s topography but also its population that has encouraged the rebels to enter it. ?Proximity to Jharkhand also helps,? said an IAS officer.

 ?We know the rebels are not static. But we will not wait and instead go the whole hog in their pursuit,? Munger commissioner Sanjeev Kumar Sinha said.

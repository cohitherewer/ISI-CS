 Maintenance

 New Delhi, March 13 (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that only the legally-wedded wife ? and not the woman who is treated like one ? is entitled to get maintenance from the husband.

 Even if a man treats a woman as wife, ?it is really inconsequential as it is the intention of the legislature (in framing the law) which is relevant and not the attitude of the party?, the court said in a recent judgment dismissing the claim of a second wife for maintenance.

 Savitaben Somabhai Bhatiya of Gujarat had filed a case for maintenance against her ?husband? who had deserted her for his first wife.

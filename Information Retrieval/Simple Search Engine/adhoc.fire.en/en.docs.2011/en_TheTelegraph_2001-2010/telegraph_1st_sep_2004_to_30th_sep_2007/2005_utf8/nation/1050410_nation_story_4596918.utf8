 Saffron virtues vs comrades? warts

 New Delhi, April 9: The BJP is the ?most youthful? of all parties, it has the ?best record? on promoting women leaders and in ?fighting caste, communal and regional prejudices at all levels?. The party has ?leadership, strength and spread? and is ?rich in idealism and ideology?.

 The CPM, in contrast, is bereft of ideology, is ideologically in a ?ghetto?, organisationally ?stagnant? and geographically ?trapped?.

 The RSS used the silver jubilee celebrations of the BJP and the CPM party congress to give its take on both the parties and no prizes for guessing who the winner is. The RSS may have had problems galore with its political sibling but its mouthpiece Organiser, in its latest issue, had nothing but unstinted praise for the BJP and unqualified criticism of the CPM.

 The lead story in the Organiser (April 17) claims that while the CPM?s agenda in the party congress was dominated by the BJP, the latter made a ?passing note of the comrades?. The editor, R. Balashankar, who wrote the piece, says: ?It is said rightly that red is a shade of saffron. On this count, the comrades must be really cheesed that the youngest party in the country, the saffron BJP, has almost changed the national political spectrum in its own colour. But there was relief in the CPM?s voice. The echo from E.K. Nayanar Nagar in Talkatora Stadium (the venue of the CPM congress) was that the Left rescue operation has succeeded in stonewalling the country?s ascent to total Hindu agenda under the BJP?s domination.?

 In its enthusiasm to counter the CPM?s criticism of the BJP, the RSS?s mouthpiece attributed virtues to it about which the party leaders, who spoke at the national council on April 6, were either apologetic or candid. The magazine described the BJP as the ?most youthful? of all national parties. 

 However, general secretary Pramod Mahajan in his address admitted that even the much-touted second-generation leaders were 50-plus and as such, it was incumbent on the BJP to go talent-spotting in the third and fourth rung of potentials.

 The RSS?s boast was the BJP had the ?best record in promoting women leadership?. This is what the deputy leader of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha, Sushma Swaraj ? its best known woman leader ? had to say to the president, L.K. Advani, when he complimented women workers for their stellar role in politics by being ?good mothers, wives and daughters? while the men indulged in serious politics.

 Bangalore, April 18: Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa and her counsel N.R. Jyothi were hauled up today for skipping their date with a special court conducting the trial of an undisclosed assets case, reports our special correspondent.

 Justice A.S. Pachhapure said he would not entertain any request for adjournment after neither Jayalalithaa, her aide Sasikala Natarajan, foster son V.N. Sudhakaran and his wife Illavarasi or their counsel attended court today.

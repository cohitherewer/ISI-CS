 BJP defends Sangh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 13: The BJP today disagreed with George Fernandess comment that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh should stop meddling in politics.

 Spokesperson Sushma Swaraj took the lead in voicing the disapproval when she called TV channels and news agencies to her residence this morning and told them: We are sad (about the National Democratic Alliance conveners statement). We disagree with it. (The) NDA is an alliance of political parties which have their own identity.

 In a statement yesterday, Fernandes had urged the RSS to confine itself to socio-cultural activities and said his comment was prompted primarily by his concerns for the NDA.

 Sushma said the BJP was inspired by the RSSs ideals and dedicated to it and noted that Fernandes had exceeded his jurisdiction and ought to respect the feelings and sentiments of the party.

 Although she is believed to be of the view that L.K. Advani should continue as BJP president for now, Sushma did not consult him before airing her defence of the RSS.

 Pyarelal Khandelwal, a Sangh pracharak, was the next to join the chorus. He should not have said all this about the relations between the BJP and the RSS, the Rajya Sabha MP said. Maybe, he has said it on his own or maybe, some of his friends have asked him to do so, he added.

 A section of the BJP suspects that Fernandes was working in tandem with Advanis former aide Sudheendra Kulkarni in the save-Advani, save-BJP-from-the-Sangh enterprise. Kulkarni was unavailable for comment.

 Uma Bharti added her bit by likening the BJP-RSS relationship to that of one between a mother and a child. (The) BJP owes its existence to the RSS and their relationship is everlasting. The moment this relationship is snapped, the BJP will be on the footpath, in fact nowhere, Uma said in Agra.

 Fernandes stuck to his stand and said if the present crisis the BJP is facing is not resolved, the situation could get serious for the NDA.

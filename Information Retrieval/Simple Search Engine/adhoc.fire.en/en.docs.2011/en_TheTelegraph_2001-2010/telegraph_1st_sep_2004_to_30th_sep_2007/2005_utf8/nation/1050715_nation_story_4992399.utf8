 Experts row stalls study bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 14: Differences among experts on some provisions of the draft bill seeking free and compulsory education for children between six and 14 could delay its introduction in Parliament, human resource development minister Arjun Singh indicated today.

 Our priority remains to finalise the bill and place it in Parliament as soon as possible. But because of the debate ? we may not be able to finalise the bill immediately, Singh told reporters at the end of the first days meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education.

 He said the government wants more inputs on the draft legislation but added that there is no intention to prolong it.

 Singh said there was very active debate on the bill by a committee headed by science and technology minister Kapil Sibal. The committee has made some changes in the draft bill.

 Professor Anil Sadgopal, a member of the Sibal-headed committee, said there were loopholes in the draft bill which make a mockery of the whole exercise. 

 War-disabled relief

 The government today decided to provide free medical treatment to war-disabled pensioners by exempting from payment to the ex-servicemens contributory health scheme. As many as 6,000 people will benefit from the decision.

 India, US build flying castles in the air

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Jan. 14: With fanfare that is typical of anything that India has to do with the US, the two governments announced yesterday that the sky is the limit in developing their bilateral air links.

 The problem is that neither country has the wherewithal to even take off the ground in attempting to reach any such objective, outlined here jointly by civil aviation minister Praful Patel and his US counterpart, transportation secretary Norman Mineta.

 Hopes that Indians in Vijayawada or Visakhapatnam or Americans in Maine or Missouri can now cheaply fly in either direction or have more choice of airlines as a result of their talks are illusory.

 ?We have before us the opportunity to give the people of India and the US a modern ?open skies? agreement that will deliver tremendous benefits for the aviation industry and for consumers in both countries, building ties between our people and creating new jobs and opportunities,? Mineta said at the start of the talks with Patel to replace an aviation agreement between the countries that was signed 49 years ago.

 Patel spoke enchantingly of the wave of liberalisation that is now sweeping Indian civil aviation, of the huge order for 250 planes that India will need in five years and of major modernisation plans for 30-odd regional airports in the next two years. 

 What he did not say was that India has signed bilateral air services agreements ? of the kind he is now negotiating with the US ? with as many as 97 countries. Of these, 51 agreements are dormant! Foreign airlines use 44 of the remaining pacts while Air-India and Indian Airlines use a mere 20. 

 What Mineta did not say was that almost all major US airlines are in various stages of bankruptcy: some have already filed for bankruptcy, others are threatening to do so and most are heading resolutely in that direction. 

 Without billions of dollars in handouts from the US Congress, America?s airline industry ? which has powerful lobbyists and backers on Capitol Hill ? would have collapsed long ago. 

 Significantly, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney, which monitors civil aviation in the region, said of the Washington talks for a new agreement that they ?will certainly deliver new market access for both sides, but the real significance will be in the beyond rights and codeshare arrangements which can be agreed or not?.

 The scope for such arrangements are, however, limited with Air-India flying only to airports in New York, Chicago and Newark. 

 The national flag carrier is in no position ? at least for now ? to expand its US operations, though it talks wistfully from time to time of going to San Francisco and Houston. Jet Airways has plans to fly to the US, possibly by next year.

 Airlines in North America do not have the stomach to go into India.

 Air Canada started a service to India from Toronto, stopped it and has stumbled into it again, half-heartedly, according to aviation sources here. 

 Only two US airlines ? Delta and NorthWest ? have token flights to India while two others ? United and American ? are on the coat-tails of other carriers by code-sharing some flights.

 It is estimated that even after Patel?s plans to augment the fleet of both Air-India and Indian Airlines, their capacity, combined with those of private airlines, will utilise only 60 per cent of facilities afforded by all of India?s 97 bilateral air service agreements.

 America?s interest in securing a new aviation pact with India would be in its spin-off effects for US airlines, especially in Sri Lanka and Nepal, which receive sizeable tourist traffic from America, and in Bangladesh.

 India will gain from any opening up of cargo traffic with a steady increase in its exports to America. 

 The civil aviation ministry?s recent experiments with ?open skies? have been successes with carriers from neighbouring states ? Qatar Airways, for instance ? nearly tripling its weekly flights to India. 

 But the current boom is expected to pass the US by, notwithstanding Mineta?s and Patel?s optimism.

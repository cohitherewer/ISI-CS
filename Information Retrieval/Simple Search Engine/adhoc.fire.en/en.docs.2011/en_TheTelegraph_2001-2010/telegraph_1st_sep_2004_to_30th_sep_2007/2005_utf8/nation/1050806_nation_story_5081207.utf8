 Pacts not on Dhaka menu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: Foreign minister K. Natwar Singhs visit to Bangladesh may help develop bonhomie between the neighbours but will not yield any agreements.

 Singh leaves for Dhaka tomorrow on a three-day trip, during which he will meet several senior Bangladeshi leaders, including Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.

 India was keen to see the agreement on combating narcotics traffic, which has been waiting for Dhakas approval for some time, initiated during the visit. 

 But Bangladesh said the pact can be signed only after its interior minister, Lutfuzzaman Babbar, returns from Washington.

 Delhi, on the other hand, has turned down Dhakas request to sign a fresh agreement reviving a cultural exchange pact that had lapsed a few years ago.

 South Block officials cite Dhakas refusal to sign the narcotics pact as yet another instance of how Bangladesh always finds a way of wriggling out of commitments. But Bangladeshi officials insist that the pact would have benefited Dhaka, and the only reason it is being put off is the ministers absence.

 Though Singh has visited many countries since becoming foreign minister in May last year, he has so far stayed away from Dhaka.

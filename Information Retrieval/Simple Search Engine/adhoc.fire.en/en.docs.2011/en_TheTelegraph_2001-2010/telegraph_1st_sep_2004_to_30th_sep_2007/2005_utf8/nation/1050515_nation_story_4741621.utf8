 Singh on Sariska missing tiger trail

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 14: After triggering a public debate on the tiger conservation crisis, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has decided to see things for himself with a visit to the heart of the controversy: Sariska in Rajasthan.

 He will camp in the Sariska National Park (also called the Sariska Tiger Reserve) ? all of whose tigers have apparently vanished ? on the night of May 23.

 Singh will be the second Prime Minister in recent memory to visit Sariska, which is 163 km from New Delhi. The first was Rajiv Gandhi.

 While Rajiv Gandhi went there on a holiday with his family and the Bachchans, Singh will be on an official mission. He will address forest officials and those engaged in Project Tiger on a subject that has become quite close to his heart: wildlife conservation.

 His visit will be watched with interest by two groups: the tiger brigade and the tribal rights lobby. The battle between these two stalled the tabling of the Scheduled Tribes (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill, 2005, by the Union cabinet in the budget session.

 The government was keen to introduce the bill but the sharp positions taken by the rival lobbies, which had articulate advocates in the political establishment, prompted it to keep the legislation on hold till a consensus emerged.

 Singh, the sources said, believes that while the rights of tribals over heritable (not alienable or transferable) forest land and minor forest produce in forest villages should be turned into law and made permanent, the objections of animal conservationists should also be taken into account. The government must see if the bill has loopholes that can be plugged with amendments.

 The save-the-tiger lobby, led by Rajya Sabha member Karan Singh and backed by ministers K. Natwar Singh and Renuka Chowdhury, argues that legalising the land rights of tribals can make them susceptible to contractors and businessmen who may exploit them and use the trees and other resources for commercial purposes. This group fears that once commercial interests enter their land, the tribals could even start poaching on wildlife.

 The pro-tribal group, which includes tribal affairs minister P.R. Kyndiah, has told the Prime Minister that tribals can be trusted with forests because they have a symbiotic relationship with their habitat. 

 The other argument cited in favour of the bill is a commitment in the UPAs common minimum programme (CMP). It says that lands classified as forests should be returned to the tribals and that states should be urged to pass laws conferring ownership rights on them.

 Singh, sources close to him said, was caught between the need to carry out the CMP promise and his own pro-active intervention in the tiger conservation project after reports of the dwindling tiger count in Sariska were brought to his notice last September. 

 He revived the nearly defunct National Board for Wildlife, ordered a CBI probe into the disappearance of Sariskas tigers and set up a task force to look into conservation practices.

 His government then announced it would constitute a special wildlife crime cell on the lines of the Narcotics Control Bureau to track down poaching and other wildlife-related crimes.

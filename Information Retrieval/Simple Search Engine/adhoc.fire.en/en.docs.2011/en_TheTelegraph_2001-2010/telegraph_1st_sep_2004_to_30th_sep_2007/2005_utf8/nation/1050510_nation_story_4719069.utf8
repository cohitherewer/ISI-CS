 Pak to build Thunder jets

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 9: Marching ahead on the road to self-reliance, the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) will begin serial production of JF-17 (Thunder) aircraft from March 2007.

 Pakistan and China are jointly producing the Thunder, which had its first test-flight in September 2003, almost 11 years after the two countries conceived the project to build an all-weather, lightweight, multi-role aircraft.

 ?The serial production will help replace ageing aircraft from the inventory of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF),? PAC chief Air Marshal Aurangzeb Khan told reporters who visited the giant aeronautical complex, located some 80 km north of the capital Islamabad.

 The JF-17 was again flown for further tests in April last year, bringing hope for the PAF, which has suffered a great deal in the last 13 years as a result of US economic and military sanctions.

 ?The first four aircraft, now being manufactured in China, will be delivered to the PAF in December next year followed by the arrival of another four jets in March 2007,? said the PAC, which is working to enhance the air forces strike power.

 Khan said after the arrival of the eight aircraft from China, the PAC would start serial production of the jets here, for which technology is being transferred to Pakistan. 

 The aircraft will be equipped for all-weather navigation, attack and jamming capability to track and destroy multiple targets.

 ?It is basically a light-weight, multi-role aircraft, which can fly at a speed of mach 1.6 with an operational ceiling of 55,000 feet,? Khan said.

 Khan did not disclose the price of the plane but said it will be much cheaper compared to many jets being flown by air forces of European countries.

 ?Most European jets are available with a price tag of more or less $50 million,? he said. ?One can buy at least three JF-17s in this price.?

 Khan said several countries have shown interest in buying the jet. However, a decision to which countries the Thunder should be sold will be taken jointly by Pakistan and China.

 The PAC chief said according to the production plan, Pakistan and China will manufacture 150 and 250 planes, respectively, over the next few years for their air forces. 

 The JF-17s Beyond Visual Range (BVR) capability, he added, would be superior to that of Indian Air Force jets.

 Pakistan, which has suffered because of the sanctions for pursuing its nuclear programme, has developed the capability to manufacture tanks, small submarines, and lightweight aircraft and rebuild the whole range of combat aircraft to offset the impact.

 Now that the sanctions have been lifted, in recognition of Pakistans ?role as the frontline state in the war against terror?, it has been pledged a $3-billion economic and military aid package by the US.

 The package includes F-16 fighter planes, latest guns and missile systems and eight P-3C Orion surveillance aircraft.

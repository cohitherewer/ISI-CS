 Dec. 3: Handsome, suave and a big hit on the cocktail circuit, Anil Mathrani built his career on his easy charm ? and by playing on an old mans dreams of greatness.

 The unglamorous yet ambitious Chacha Kesri, during his short term as Congress chief in 1997-98, had thought he finally had the chance to gain the recognition and fame he had craved for long. The Congress was out of power and the old man was in a hurry.

 The wily, old-style backroom politician was at home in domestic politics. But he wanted to show himself off as a man on a par with global leaders, capable of dealing with international issues, and here he felt out of his depth.

 Mathrani, who had been around in the Congress since the early 80s without being able to attract the limelight, saw his chance. He sold Kesri the idea that his dream of becoming Prime Minister depended on his acceptability among world powers. And that Mathrani, the man of the world, could arrange that with his connections.

 Thus began an odd partnership that set Mathrani on his way to success, leading him ? despite his lack of formal diplomatic training ? to the post of Indian ambassador to Croatia in January this year.

 Kesri handed Mathrani the coveted post of secretary, AICC foreign affairs department? a job that gave him easy access to the world of front-ranking diplomats and visiting dignitaries. In exchange, he ensured for Chacha the chance to rub shoulders with American, European, Arab and African leaders.

 In one instance, Kesri was delighted to receive a Palestinian delegation. The politician felt his meeting with the Arabs would send a strong signal to the minorities and bring them closer to the Congress in the post-Narasimha Rao era.

 On another occasion, Mathrani advised Kesri not to flaunt his proximity to an Israeli team, citing how bad it could be for his image.

 Kesri was not the only one Mathrani tried to charm. When he joined the Youth Congress, he tried to get close to Indira Gandhi and then Rajiv. He was kept at arms length.

 Post-Kesri, Mathrani joined middling politicians like Anand Sharma, who were extending a hand of friendship to African and East European nations. He managed berths in a few Congress delegations and gained entry into Delhis diplomatic circles.

 At that time, Mathrani was staying at New Delhis Curzon Road Apartments (flat A-101) with his mother and IAS brother Roy Mathrani. His neighbours recall how the handsome man would be dropped home in the small hours in fancy cars with CD number plates.

 The circles in which he moved made up for his lack of formal diplomatic training. The Congresss party-to-party contact with sympathetic groups ? ranging from Iraqs Baath and Pakistan Peoples Party to the Communist Party of Russia ? came in handy.

 To Sonia, he was a familiar face, someone who had always been around. He was not an insider at 10 Janpath nor a loyalist in the Congress lexicon, but he knew people who mattered. Mathrani was retained because men like Natwar Singh and Eduardo Faleiro were comfortable with him and never spoke ill of him. 

 At 10 Janpath, they must be wondering why Natwar is complaining about him now. After all, a few months ago, when Mathrani was informally liaising with foreign ministry mandarins, he was not checked.

 ?Political? judges in CJI glare

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: The Chief Justice of India will consult chief justices of all high courts on the elevation of ?politicised lawyers? as judges.

 The decision followed a private complaint by G. Rajendran, the president of the Madras High Court Practising Advocates? Association.

 He brought to the notice of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti the imminent elevation of eight lawyers belonging to the DMK, ADMK and the Congress as Madras High Court judges.

 The Chief Justice, Rajendran said, met him in his chamber in the Supreme Court and told him to also ?apprise? the high court chief justice.

 The advocates? association president said the Chief Justice of India ?agreed with me in the matter and expressed concern about elevation of such lawyers to the bench?.

 ?There are lawyers? associations of political parties named after courts like Madras High Court DMK Lawyers? Association, Madras High Court AIADMK Advocates? Forum. This has percolated down to the district and moffusil level, like the Coimbatore District and Sessions Court DMK Lawyers? Association,? Rajendran said.

 ?From these party-wing lawyers? associations, the members are elevated to the bench, generating doubt about judicial function and loss of credibility of the judiciary,? he said.

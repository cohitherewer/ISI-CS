 Porn stain off, Anara in reel role

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Anara: Showtime

 Shimla, June 23: Having put behind her the allegation of starring in a porn film, beauty queen Anara Gupta is finally ready to face the camera.

 The former Miss Jammu, cleared by a forensic report of the police allegation that she had acted in a sleazy CD, is featuring in a Punjabi pop album and has bagged a role in a Bollywood movie, too.

 Anara has been in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, since Tuesday, shooting for the album Tor Punjabian Di (Style of Punjabis).

 The shooting will last a week and Anara is being featured in two songs, said a spokesperson for Janu Telefilms, which is filming the album.

 The album is being shot in the backdrop of the Dhauladhar range and the location, Chamunda, is a well-known shaktipeetha (pilgrimage centre associated with Durga).

 Barred by a court in November from speaking to the media, Anara merely posed for news photographers.

 She wants to focus on her film career. She will sign up for a good film and will soon start her screen career, her mother Rajrani Gupta said.

 Anaras family has not forgotten the pain and shame brought on by the police accusations in October.

 Anara had maintained that she had not featured in any porn movie. A forensic laboratory in Andhra Pradesh later contradicted the police, saying the woman featured in a CD sent to it was not Anara.

 Well continue to fight against the corrupt officers who framed Anara, Rajrani said. The blemish on her has been wiped out by the forensic report. She does not want to return to Jammu and wants to forget the past.

 Rajrani said her daughter has received offers to act in several Bollywood films. 

 Four film producers and directors, including Mahesh Bhatt, have shown interest in featuring Anara in their upcoming films. She has already been signed up for the Bollywood film Hero Zindabad. Her co-stars are Govinda, Raveena Tandon and Kader Khan. 

 Anara and five others were booked for allegedly running a prostitution racket.

 Borderless science cry

 Chennai, Dec. 1: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today called for joint research with other countries in vital areas like earthquake forecasting and precision monsoon predictions to take the sting out of natural disasters, reports our special correspondent.

 As another depression loomed over Chennai and south Andhra Pradesh, Kalam told an international conference at IIT Madras that science without borders in certain key areas was vital for the future of mankind.

 When I travelled over the flood-hit areas in Tamil Nadu today, I saw what havoc floods can do to millions and millions of people, the President said after an aerial survey of some of the worst flood-hit parts of Tamil Nadu.

 Floods and earthquakes were becoming a global problem, he said while inaugurating the conference on computational and experimental engineering and sciences.

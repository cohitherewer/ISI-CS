 Dara agrees to tap SC

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, June 28: Dara Singh, alias Rabindra Kumar Pal, will move the Supreme Court against the verdict of Orissa High Court in the Graham Staines murder case.

 The high court, in its judgment last month, had commuted the death sentence of Dara to life imprisonment and acquitted 11 of 12 others.

 Australian missionary Staines and his sons were burnt alive in 1999. In September 2003, a designated CBI court had awarded Dara the death penalty and life terms to the 12 others in the murder.

 Daras counsel Bana Mohanty said he would move the Supreme Court for his acquittal through a special leave petition in the second week of July.

 Mohanty said he, along with Daras family members, including his elder brother and brother-in-law, went to Baripada jail to meet him. After a marathon discussion for over four hours, Dara yielded to our proposal.

 Dara reportedly told Mohanty that he expects a favourable verdict from the apex court.

 Debasish Panda, who was Daras lawyer in Orissa High Court, was confident that his case has sufficient merit to move the Supreme Court. 

 Reacting to the statement of Sajan George, the national convener of the Global Council for Indian Christians, who recently urged the CBI to move the apex court, Dara said the organisation is trying to influence the judiciary through the media.

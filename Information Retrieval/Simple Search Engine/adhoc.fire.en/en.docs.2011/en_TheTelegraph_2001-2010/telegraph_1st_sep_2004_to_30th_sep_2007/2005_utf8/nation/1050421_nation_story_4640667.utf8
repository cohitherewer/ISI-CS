 Medical students on strike path

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 20: Medical services at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack are set to suffer from tomorrow when junior doctors and house surgeons go on an indefinite strike to protest the killing of Arun Kumar, a senior student.

 The decision, which threatened to paralyse medical services in the largest hospital of the state, was taken after the doctors and surgeons submitted a memorandum to the revenue divisional commissioner (central), demanding a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the family of the deceased. The chief minister yesterday announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the family of Kumar, who hailed from Thiruvananthapuram.

 ?We have decided to strike work from tomorrow. It will continue till the government doles out the demanded compensation and ensures our protection,? said Debashis Marandi, a member of the junior doctors? association.

 The RDC and the medical superintendent reportedly pleaded with the doctors not to go ahead with the strike and give some time to the police to crack the case. 

 The junior doctors yesterday blocked NH 5 at OMP Square in Cuttack and demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident. 

 On Monday afternoon, five motorcycle-borne criminals, not six as the police had earlier said, gunned down contractors Subash Dash and Dhirendra Sethi at Delta Colony Square in the Unit-8 area of the capital. 

 Later in the evening, a stray bullet fired by an alleged criminal killed Arun Kumar, a junior doctor of SCB Medical College in Cuttack. The incident took place when Santosh Pashcimakabat, the gangster, opened fire while trying to escape from a police official.

 Preliminary investigation into the contractors? murder revealed that it was the work of hired killers and the primary motive was rivalry over the submission of tenders. The needle of suspicion pointed at the gang of Anil Chhotray, who had been evading the police for the past three years. 

 Bhubaneswar superintendent of police Amitabh Thakur said a combing operation was on to nab the assailants. ?Four special operation groups have conducted raids in and around the district in the past 48 hours,? another police official said.

 ?We want to leave no stone unturned in our probe. We will crack the case in the next few days,? Thakur said.

 He, however, admitted that the police are finding it hard to directly nail Chhotray in the case. 

 In an interesting turn, Cuttack police claimed that Paschimkabat was not involved in the murder of the two contractors. But Bhubaneswar police believe that the criminal, who was forwarded to court yesterday, could have had a hand in the capital killings.

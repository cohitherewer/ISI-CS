 Diplomat car snatch

 Colombo, July 23 (PTI): Unidentified gunmen today snatched the vehicle of Indias assistant high commissioner in Sri Lanka, K.R. Rajan Pillai, after forcing him and his family out of it, police said.

 The brand new four-wheel drive vehicle was wrested from the diplomat at Ambepussa, about 60 km east of the Lankan capital, by two gunmen. 

 Pillai, along with his family, had just left a restaurant on the main highway where they had stopped for breakfast, police said.

 The vehicle, a Toyota Landcruiser, did not have the number plates for diplomat cars.

 Pillai heads the high commission office in the hill capital of Kandy and was apparently on his way to Colombo when the incident occurred.

 Police said an investigation was on.

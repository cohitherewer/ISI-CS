 Nepal off China itinerary

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, March 14: Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has decided to skip Nepal during his tour of South Asia next month.

 China has been the only country to back the monarch after the royal coup in Kathmandu. But keeping in mind Indian sensitivity, Wen has decided to drop Nepal from his South Asian itinerary.

 The Chinese Prime Minister begins his tour of the region from April 5 with a visit to Pakistan. He will be there for two days after which he travels to Bangladesh.

 The next day, he leaves for Sri Lanka and comes to India on a four-day official visit from April 9. Since China does not have diplomatic relations with Bhutan, he will not go there.

 But Nepal, with which Beijing has strong relations, is being overlooked because the Chinese leadership is taking extra precaution not to send any wrong signal to Delhi on what is being seen as a crucial visit.

 But there are indications that the Chinese foreign minister may visit Nepal in April. Though the dates have not yet been finalised, reports from Kathmandu suggest that the visit might come through some time next month.

 China has perhaps been the only key international player which has so far not criticised King Gyanendra. Beijing has dismissed the developments in Kathmandu as ?internal affairs? of Nepal.

 But there are indications that the king has got an assurance from China that it will back him on any action to ?stabilise? the country.

 Reports from Nepal suggest that Gyanendra may undertake a visit to Beijing to send a signal to India and the rest of the world that if he fails to get their support, he will be forced to turn to China. 

 In the past, Nepalese monarchs have played ?the China card?. But unlike then when Beijing was also part of the brinkmanship, the Chinese leadership is now of the view that Kathmandu?s future lies in maintaining strong relations with India.

 China has also been embarrassed by the Maoist guerrillas? decision to use the name of Mao Zedong in the fight against the monarchy.

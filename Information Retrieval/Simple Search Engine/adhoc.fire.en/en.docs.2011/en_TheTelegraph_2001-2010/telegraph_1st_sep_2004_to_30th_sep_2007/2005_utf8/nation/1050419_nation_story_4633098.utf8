 3-star general

 Islamabad, April 18 (PTI): Pervez Musharraf today advocated a three-phased approach to resolve the ?complicated? Kashmir issue.

 Interacting with Pakistani journalists in Delhi before boarding a plane for Manila, the Pakistan President said the first step is to broadly ascertain the will of Kashmiris, which can never be ignored, to set a broad direction. Step two, he added, is to reach a consensus through debate and discussions before a final decision is taken by the top leadership in India and Pakistan.

 ?This is so complicated, even if three persons sit down, they can never agree. This is that complicated an issue. It is the top leadership which needs to sit down and think of broadly what kind of solution is possible between India, Pakistan and people of Kashmir,? Musharraf said.

 ?At this moment, the leadership which means frankly myself and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are sincere in our desire, flexible enough and may be bold enough to move forward. I am optimistic,? he said.

 ?It is my firm belief that the Kashmir issue should be discussed by the top leadership of the two countries. Resolution is not possible other than (by the) top leadership,? he added.

 Musharraf said top leaders of the two countries have agreed to continue the discussions. ?We have decided that we need to take the process on the resolution of the Kashmir issue forward in a purposeful manner for the final settlement of the issue.?

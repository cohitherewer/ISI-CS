 New Delhi, July 20: The Centre has rushed a team of bomb experts of the National Security Guards and forensic analysts to Jammu and Kashmir to investigate the car bomb explosion in Srinagar.

 Special secretary (internal security) Anil Chowdhary said the Centre is still trying to establish whether it was a suicide attack or militants used the car as an improvised explosive device and blew it up with a remote control. Kashmir police have said the strike has the hallmark of a suicide attack. 

 Chowdhary said the number of car bomb attacks ? todays was the sixth in a year ? has gone up because beleaguered militants are resorting to desperate measures to cause maximum damage.

 He said that last year till June, militants had made 49 attempts to infiltrate while by this June, such attempts were limited to 10. As many as 227 militants had crossed over to India in June last year but this year, only 77 could do so, Chowdhary added.

 The Centre has not yet accepted the claim of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen that it carried out the blast. As Hizb is not known for carrying out such attacks, intelligence agencies suspect that other outfits could be trying to throw the security forces off track.

 A source said central intelligence had warned Kashmir police of the possibility of escalation in such attacks and advised them to search vehicles more thoroughly in Srinagar.

 An official said a report sent to the Union home ministry by two central forces ? the CRPF and the BSF ? had accused the state police of slackness in searching vehicles.

 The special secretary said specific instructions have been given to the state police for inspecting vehicles moving in and out of VIP zones in Srinagar.

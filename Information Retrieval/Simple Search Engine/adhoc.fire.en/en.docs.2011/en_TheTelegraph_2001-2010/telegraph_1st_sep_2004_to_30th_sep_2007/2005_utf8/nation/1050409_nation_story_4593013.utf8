 Sangh signal to CMs

 New Delhi, April 8: The Hindu New Year according to the RSS?s calendar ? varsha pratipada ? is usually a low-key event at the Nagpur headquarters. This year, RSS sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan has brought the occasion into the media spotlight by inviting the chief ministers of BJP-ruled states, reports our special correspondent.

 So far, three chief ministers have agreed: Gujarat?s Narendra Modi, Madhya Pradesh?s Babulal Gaur and Chhattisgarh?s Raman Singh.

 RSS spokesperson Madhav downplayed the event, saying it was a ?mere coincidence? that the chief ministers would be in Nagpur. 

 However, BJP sources said the presence of Modi and Gaur was ?significant? as both are under the weather in their states with dissidents keen to see the last of them. 

 Modi, once the Sangh?s darling, fell foul of it after he reportedly antagonised its farmers? wing, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, for opposing his government?s power reforms.

 Stop-gap tag on Advani heir

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: L.K. Advanis successor will be an interim BJP president, serving from December 2005 to February 2007. 

 The new presidents tenure will, therefore, not be three years, which the partys constitution allows, but roughly 14 months. Advani is expected to quit by this year- end.

 Sources said that another president will be in place in February 2007, and he will be elected or chosen by consensus. The idea is to allow Advanis successor to complete the remaining part of a turbulent three-year period that began in February 2004, when M. Venkaiah Naidu was anointed in a national council in Delhi. Naidu voluntarily gave up the post seven months later, citing his spouses illness as the reason. Advani was brought in his place.

 But with a little over a year remaining after he gives up office in December, sources said it was politically expedient to have a stop-gap arrangement rather than allow a new chief to begin a fresh term.

 The BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh interpreted this possible arrangement in their own ways. Some in the BJP saw this as a way of allowing Advani to reinstate Naidu as his successor and controlling the party by proxy, because Naidu continues to be his staunchest loyalist.

 The other interpretation was that the Sangh, which thinks it calls the shots after the recent developments, would bring in a low-profile person who would focus exclusively on strengthening the party organisation instead of promoting himself.

 To the Sangh, which believes the National Democratic Alliance government had run roughshod over the party, the top priority is to bring the organisation back on the rails.

 The name of the party vice-president and Rajya Sabha MP, Bal Apte, was mentioned as a likely choice in this context. It is believed that Apte, who hails from Mumbai, was backed by the Maharashtrian lobby of the Sangh, which included the powerful second-in-command, Mohanrao Bhagwat. In the BJP, Pramod Mahajan was reportedly rooting for him to boost his own position that has been vastly undermined in the eyes of the Sangh.

 Till a month ago, Sushma Swaraj and Rajnath Singh had been topping the charts in the leadership sweepstakes. Rajnath, sources said, was not keen on an interim term and indicated he would rather wait till 2007, when Uttar Pradesh goes to the polls.

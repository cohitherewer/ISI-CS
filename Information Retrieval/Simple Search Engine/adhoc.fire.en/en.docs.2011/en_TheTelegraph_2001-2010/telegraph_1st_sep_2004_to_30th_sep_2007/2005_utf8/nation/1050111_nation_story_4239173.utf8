 Bihar allies in unity parade

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: It was billed as a ?dream? show of unity ? the kind of spectacle the BJP-Janata Dal (United) would have wanted to mount before the 2000 elections but could not and swallowed the ignominy of watching Rabri Devi come back to power. 

 Today, 20 netas ? big, bigger and biggest ? sat cheek by jowl against the backdrop of a poster which proclaimed ?15 saal, bura haal, sarkar badlo, Bihar badlega (15 years, terrible plight, change the government, Bihar?s face will automatically change)? and had the BJP?s lotus and the Dal (U)?s arrow symbols. 

 From Nitish Kumar, Sharad Yadav, Digvijay Singh, K.C. Tyagi, Prabhunath Singh and the Dal (U)?s latest acquisition, Jagannath Mishra, to Arun Jaitley, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Gopal Narain Singh and Sushil Modi ? the leadership embraced virtually Bihar?s caste gamut but excluded the minorities. Dal (U) president George Fernandes was away in Mumbai for a medical check-up while the BJP?s minority poster boy, Shahnawaz Hussain, was absent.

 Nitish announced that the Dal (U) will contest 138 seats in Bihar and the BJP 105. In Jharkhand, the BJP would play the senior partner and fight 63 seats and the Dal (U) 17. As if to underline the ?unity? theme, Jaitley said: ?If we have to decide who will be our chief minister, we will be able to decide without a problem.? Nitish, however, clarified he was not a contender.

 Despite the leaders? claim that their alliance would get a clear majority because the ?anti-RJD vote was stronger than the pro-RJD vote?, Nitish made it clear that the Lok Janshakti Party, headed by Ram Vilas Paswan, was still welcome to join the alliance. ?We cannot indefinitely wait for Paswan because the polls were notified today and the process of filing of nominations has begun. But if the LJP is really against the RJD, it should reconsider its strategy.?

 Asked how the seats would be redistributed if Paswan changed his mind and crossed over to the NDA, he said: ?Both of us (the Dal and the BJP) will give up some of our seats.? Nitish also said even if Paswan fought solo, the Dal (U)-BJP would not attack him in their campaign, indicating that the LJP was welcome as a post-poll ally. ?Our campaign is against only the RJD and Laloo Prasad Yadav and no other individual,? he stressed.

 Mumbai, Aug. 31: A video game parlour owner who is believed to have threatened actor Karisma Kapoors estranged husband Sanjay Kapur has been arrested.

 A special team of Delhi police raided Amit Cyber Cafe in Mulund in Mumbais eastern suburbs last night and caught Rajkumar Vajirchandani. The team informed the Mulund police station as a formality and escorted Vajirchandani to Delhi. 

 The game parlour owner is said to have sent a threatening e-mail demanding Rs 50 lakh from the Bollywood stars Delhi-based husband.

 Residents said Vajirchandani owned the Royalking Video Game Parlour in this Gujarati-dominated suburb of Mulund and regularly logged on to the Internet from the tiny Amit Cyber Cafe. 

 He also has an Internet connection at his parlour but the particular e-mail in which he threatened Kapur was traced to Amit Cyber Cafe. 

 The Delhi police took him to the capital directly. We do not know anything about the case, Mulund police officials said.

 Mumbai police sources said Vajirchandani had no links with Karisma and her family. 

 The man does not seem to have any connection with the Kapoor family. It is difficult to say why he sent that e-mail to Kapur. It is up to Delhi police to find out why he did it, a senior crime branch officer said.

 Last week, Kapur had lodged a complaint with the police in Delhi saying he had received threatening e-mails warning him of dire consequences if he did not pay Rs 50 lakh. 

 The threat came at a time when he had claimed before Delhi High Court that he had paid Karismas credit card and night club bills and also settled the dues of film producers. 

 The one-and-a-half-year-old marriage is on the rocks, with the couple now locked in a custody fight over their daughter Samaira, who was born in Mumbai in March.

 Cong in denial, rivals seize on Rahul words

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rahul Gandhi: Stuck?

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The Congress today denied that Rahul Gandhi had given a formal interview to Tehelka, but Bihar rival Janata Dal (United) twisted the knife, welcoming the Amethi MPs sudden awakening of conscience.

 The news magazine had quoted Rahul as saying there is no trace of governance in centrally-ruled Bihar ? just what the Dal (United) has been alleging ? and that he could have been Prime Minister a decade ago if he had so wished.

 Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi today claimed Tehelka had served up a casual conversation at an informal meeting as an interview. The write-up was riddled with misrepresentations, misquotes and discrepancies.

 Singhvi specifically denied Rahul had claimed he could have been Prime Minister at 25, but did not mention any of the other remarks, including the ones on Bihar.

 The Dal (United) spokesperson, however, gloated: Young Rahul Gandhi, in a rare lapse into truthfulness, has confirmed what we have been saying for ages. Now Rahul must prove his courage of conviction, the spokesperson said.

 He should demand the resignation of Sonia Gandhi from the UPA. He should ask Manmohan Singh to resign because the Centre these days is responsible for the absence of governance in Bihar. And he should get Laloo Prasad Yadav sacked for ruining Bihar.

 The Dal (United), whose main poll plank is misgovernance and lack of development in Bihar, is set to milk Rahuls statements for whatever they are worth.

 This morning, excited party leaders were waving copies of the latest issue of Tehelka, banned in Dal (United) offices ever since the media organisation, in its web portal avatar, unearthed a defence scam involving George Fernandes.

 In private, Congress leaders admit that Rahul might have expressed his personal views on Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. We all share our views at informal conversations. We do so in confidence. We dont expect them to be presented as authorised interviews, a party leader said.

 Asked if the party disagrees with Rahuls reported remark about lack of governance in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the spokesman said: As a party, our views are quite different. As a party, we think there is scope for improvement in governance.

 Probe after death of Beur inmates 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 4: Beur Central Jail is back in news with the death of three inmates, including a woman, last night.

 Rajdeo Singh (85) of Sasaram and Lala Yadav (74) of Gaya had been sentenced to life imprisonment for murder while undertrial Champa Devi (48) of Nepal was arrested here a few months ago for her alleged involvement in Maoist operations.

 The three inmates were taken to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) yesterday for ?better treatment? and declared dead later in the night.

 Calling the deaths natural, the jail administration said they were caused by illness. ?All three inmates were ill and undergoing treatment at the jail hospital. Prison officials got them admitted in the medical college because of the seriousness of the illness. The deaths are nothing but natural,? a source quoted jail superintendent Dilip Kumar Singh as saying.

 However, Vasudev Pandey, who registered the case at the hospital, said Singh and Yadav were brought dead to the hospital while the woman was having breathing problems. The jail document sent to PMCH said the three were being referred there for better treatment. 

 Jail minister Raghavendra Pratap Singh promptly ordered inspector-general (prisons) Deepak Kumar Singh to conduct a probe.

 ?The deaths may be due to lingering diseases. But if the jail administration is guilty of negligence either in providing sufficient medical care or any other way, it should be ascertained at once. We will take proper action soon,? the minister said.

 While Singh said there seemed to be nothing wrong with Champa Devi?s health when he met her sometime ago at the Phulwari Sharif jail, a source pointed out that she had complained to the minister of her deteriorating condition after her transfer to the model prison in Beur. ?I want to find out under what circumstances did the two men and the woman die,? Singh said. 

 The IG (prisons) will visit the jail tomorrow. ?Prima facie, the deaths appear to have been caused by illness as the jail document showed that the three were shifted to PMCH for better treatment,? he said.

 Station attack: A group of 30 Naxalites attacked security personnel at Kajara railway station in the Kiul-Jamalpur section of East Central Railway this afternoon and looted five SLR rifles and 500 cartridges from security personnel deployed there, reports our correspondent.

 Police later claimed to have recovered 150 cartridges from a nearby hilltop. One GRP assistant sub-inspector and three Bihar Military Police constables were injured in the attack and later admitted in a hospital at Surajgarh, said Luckisarai district magistrate Sharif Alam.

 New Kotla on show 

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, April 5: When 

 the curtain goes up here on the one-dayer between India 

 and Pakistan, it will be a curtain-raiser for the newly 

 revamped Ferozeshah Kotla.

 The stadium is on a major corporate-funded makeover that the Delhi District Cricket Association, presided over by Arun Jaitley, has initiated.

 The revamp will find Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf enjoying the match from the old pavilion that will be transformed into a high-security zone full of Special Protection Group cover, mobile jammers and metal detectors.

 The first match in the Kotla in three years will bring the stadium back into the reckoning with a bang in cricket-starved Delhi, promised Jaitley. ?The arrangements are better than at Lord?s.?

 ?It is the first stadium in the country to adopt a desired funding model where not a single paise has been spent by the government,? the former Union minister claimed.

 ?The stadium was (re)-built at Rs 50 crore, raised from the corporate sector that has bought boxes in the stadium for 10 years at the cost of Rs 1 lakh a seat,? he said.

 ITC and the Tatas are the biggest contributors, each of which will flank the row of corporate boxes with the other revamp players like ONGC, Hutch, JP Power company and TVS finding seats in between. ?Only one side remains to be taken and there are so many bidders already, that I am sure it will also be snapped up in another 15 days,? Jaitley said.

 ?On each floor of the pavilion is a lounge box sold to the corporates so that you can watch matches on a flatscreen TV in AC comfort.? 

 With the corporate biggies around and 270 seats reserved for the media, seats for public will number 12,000. But those with complimentary tickets won?t be among the audience as all seats will be available only for a price. 

 ?Delhi is a city of freedom fighters because everyone fights for freebies,? an association member quipped.

 Privileged seats, which will come with lunch, will cost Rs 11,000 each. The total number of seats is expected to be around 50,000 once the revamp is complete.

 ?We will stop the construction in another day or two and start preparing the stadium for the match. After that, hoardings will be put up,? said Narendra Batra, cricket association joint secretary and project manager.

 Curators, groundsmen and others are working overtime to prepare the Kotla to receive the teams and Musharraf on April 17. Pakistan last played there in 1999.

 ?We have had to dig up the entire ground to about 1 ft and even up to 2 ft in places. The old mud was removed and a new one was laid,? said Chetan Chauhan, the association vice-president.

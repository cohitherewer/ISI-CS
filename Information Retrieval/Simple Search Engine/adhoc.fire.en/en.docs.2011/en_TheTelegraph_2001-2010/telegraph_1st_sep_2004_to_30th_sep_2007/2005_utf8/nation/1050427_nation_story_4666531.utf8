 Facelift for second link road

 Jammu, April 26 (PTI): After the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, it is the turn of the Poonch-Rawalkot link road connecting both sides of the Line of Control to get a facelift.

 A high-level team of engineers, headed by Jammu and Kashmir roads and buildings minister Gulam Ahmed Mir, will survey repair and renovation works on the Indian side from tomorrow.

 The road, between Poonch in Jammu and Kashmir and Rawalkot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, is considered to be one of the shortest links, official sources said. Of the 30-km stretch, about 19 km fall in PoK, Mir said, adding the link falls on the Poonch-Krishna-Ghati-Mendhar road.

 Mir will submit a report to the Centre, the sources said.

 The announcement of the reopening of the link road was made on April 18 in New Delhi in a joint statement issued by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf.

 Also on the agenda is the repair of a bridge on the Poonch river separating both sides, Mir said. The bridge was damaged during the war with Pakistani raiders in 1947-48.

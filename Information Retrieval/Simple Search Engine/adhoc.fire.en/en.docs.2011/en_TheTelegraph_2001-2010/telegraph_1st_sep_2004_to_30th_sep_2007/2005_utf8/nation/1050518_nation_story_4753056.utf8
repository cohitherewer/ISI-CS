 Left wangles power sops

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, May 17: In a concession to Left parties, the government has agreed to consider several crucial amendments to the controversial electricity act passed by the previous regime.

 The agreement reached after a four-and-a-half-hour meeting between Left leaders and Union power minister P.M. Sayeed has come just ahead of tomorrows co-ordination committee meeting between the United Progressive Alliance and the Left at the Prime Ministers residence.

 We have agreed to defer the two-day strike we had planned at the month-end following the decisions reached at todays meeting, said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan, who was present at the meeting.

 At a separate meeting at the CPM headquarters this evening, the Left parties decided to stay away from Sundays celebrations to mark one year in office for the Congress-led government.

 At tomorrows co-ordination committee meeting, the Left parties have decided to voice their serious concerns. Their message remains clear: the government has not done enough for the poor.

 On the 2003 electricity act, however, the Left parties have managed a temporary reprieve. The government has agreed to keep in abeyance unbundling of state electricity boards for six months. Under the act, the process of unbundling would have come into operation from June 9.

 This was the crux of our opposition to the act, Bardhan said.

 The government has agreed to study the impact of unbundling on the people, the CPI leader added.

 Unbundling would mean separating the three branches of the electricity sector ?generation, transmission and distribution ? and handing them over to private companies.

 Advocates for unbundling argue the move would cut down costs and minimise losses. At present, electricity boards incur a 20-25 per cent loss in transmission and distribution.

 The proponents of unbundling say separation of responsibility will increase efficiency.

 The decision to keep unbundling on hold ? even if for six months ? is being seen as a move by the government to buy time and not jettison the provision altogether.

 The Left is also opposed to ending cross-subsidisation of electricity which helps state governments distribute free power to farmers.

 The government has agreed to amend this provision (in the act), Bardhan said.

 Todays meeting with Sayeed came after the Left parties wrote not one but several letters to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi urging them to review the electricity act.

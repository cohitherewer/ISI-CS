 Seer case shift plea 

 New Delhi, April 18: The Supreme Court today fixed May 6 for hearing a petition of Kanchi sankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati seeking to transfer his trial outside Tamil Nadu, reports our legal correspondent.

 The seer, accused in the Shankar Raman murder case, has petitioned that ?fair and free? trial would not be possible in the state.

 Jayendra Saraswati?s counsel, Fali Nariman, said the investigating officer, Prem Kumar, was setting false evidence against the seer?s advocates. 

 ?Prem Kumar prompts the witnesses during examination to level charges against the seer?s advocates, making it difficult to engage lawyers in his defence,? he told the court.

 He alleged that the officer had made approver Ravi Subramanian ?implicate? three advocates in the case.

 The apex bench of Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur told the counsel to file an affidavit and posted the matter to May 6. 

 Nariman appealed to the judges to make sure that ?till then?, nothing happens at the trial court. ?If charges are framed, then it would be difficult to argue and get the case transferred outside? Tamil Nadu, Nariman told the bench. The court is slated to commence trial from April 27.

 The petition, however, does not include the plea. Stay of trial proceedings is usually sought in the main prayer. If not, a criminal miscellaneous application is filed along with the transfer petition, seeking to stay trial till the apex court?s decision. It is not yet known whether a criminal miscellaneous petition would be filed before May 6 or even April 27.

 In his petition, the seer has alleged that several ?educational and health? programmes started by the Kanchi trust had invited the wrath of chief minister Jayalalithaa. The establishment of the Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi Medical College, getting deemed university status for an institution set up by the trust and collection of over Rs 30 crore by the trust for education and health were ?some of the reasons the petitioner could think of? for implicating him in the murder, the sankaracharya said.

 Jayendra Saraswati was arrested on November 11 last year and was granted bail by the Supreme Court on January 10 after two months in Vellore jail. The seer has said Jayalalithaa took personal interest in the case, supervised it step by step.

 NCC cadets get nod to fly solo

 Bhopal (PTI): The National Cadet Corps 

 (NCC) has for the first time allowed its cadets to fly solo.

 ?For the first time, I have granted permission to the NCC cadets to carry out solo-flying so that they can later join the Air force or pursue private flying,? said Lt General M.C. Bhandari, the NCC director general.

 The NCC will also induct Austria?s Super Dimona motorised gliders to its inventory, he said.

 ?We have planned to discard obsolete equipment and bring in modern ones like the recent induction of 5.56 INSAS rifles,? Bhandari said.

 Induction of other equipment like better quality rafting equipment and global positioning system for air squadrons has been outlined in the NCC?s Vision 2010 programme, he added.

 The corps will also establish ?NCC nagars? in a phased manner at the directorate level and at the group level in all states. ?Chief ministers of almost all states have agreed in principle to extend support,? he added.

 Apart from housing NCC personnel, the ?nagars? will have pre-selection training centres, a sports academy and training facilities like small arms ranges and obstacle courses, Bhandari said.

 The Madhya Pradesh government has agreed to allot land in Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur, Sagar and Gwalior to start such complexes, he said.

 Pope mourning plea quashed

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court on 

 Wednesday dismissed a petition against the Centre?s decision

 A division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice Sanjay Kisan Kaul dismissed the petition ? filed by Shashi Bhushan, a part-time lecturer at Khalsa College, and Deepak Phore ? saying it was an ?abuse of process? of law to gain publicity.

 The petitioners had sought the court?s directive asking the Centre to make specific rules for declaring a state mourning.

 ?It is for the executive to decide when to declare state mourning and we are not going to interfere in such matters,? the bench said.

 The petitioners were also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 for having ?wasted the court?s time and abused the process of law?. A bailable warrant will be issued against them if they fail to deposit the amount at the high court registry within a week.

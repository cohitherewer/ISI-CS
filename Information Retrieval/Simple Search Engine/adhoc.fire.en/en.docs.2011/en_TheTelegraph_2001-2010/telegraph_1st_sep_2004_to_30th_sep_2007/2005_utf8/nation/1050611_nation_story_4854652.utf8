The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Secular wordplay to bury ghost

 The following is the statement issued after the BJP parliamentary board meeting on L.K. Advanis visit to Pakistan.

 The Bharatiya Janata Party lauds the path-breaking visit to Pakistan by its president, Shri L.K. Advani. The week-long tour has brought the people of India and Pakistan closer, helped remove a mountain of misunderstandings between them and taken the momentum of better relations to a new level, in continuance of the policy of friendship initiated by successive governments led by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The warm and enthusiastic response Shri Advanis visit elicited from both the officials and ordinary people of Pakistan proves the correctness of the NDAs policy of pursuing good neighbourly ties.... 

 The party is happy to note that Shri Advani... impressed upon him (the Pakistan President) the need to immediately dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism and bring cross-border terrorism to an end. Shri Advani emphasised that lasting peace in South Asia would be possible only when such issues were... resolved between India and Pakistan. 

 The BJP appreciates the Pakistan governments invitation to Shri Advani to inaugurate the restored portion of the Katasraj temple, revered by all Hindus... as a resting place of the Pandavas. The overwhelming response to his Katasraj visit could well go down as a turning point in removing long-held misgivings between the people of the two countries. The BJP hopes that Pakistan will... ensure that the rights of Hindus and other religious minorities are fully protected and that official initiatives to restore and develop other mandirs and gurdwaras continue in the future. 

 Shri Advani welcomed the event in Katasraj as a good beginning and in that context without describing Mr Jinnah as secular reminded the people of Pakistan of its founders address to the countrys Constituent Assembly in which he had urged full freedom of faith for all its citizens and no discrimination between its citizens on grounds of religion.

 The BJP reiterates that whatever may have been Jinnahs vision of Pakistan, the state he founded is theocratic and non-secular, the very idea of Hindus and Muslims being two separate nations is repugnant to it. The BJP has always condemned the division of India on communal lines and continues to... reject the two-nation theory championed by Jinnah.... There can be no revisiting the reality that Jinnah led a communal agitation to achieve his goal of Pakistan, which devoured thousands of innocent people in its wake and dispossessed millions of their homes and livelihoods.

 Scent of Pawar meet brings axe on Rane

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

New Delhi, July 3: Former Maharashtra chief minister Narayan Rane, who was expelled from the Shiv Sena today, might have hastened his exit from the party.

 Rane is understood to have held a meeting with Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar here on June 24 with a proposal to join the Union agriculture ministers party. Rane is understood to have made the move as he was increasingly feeling suffocated by the domination of the party by Sena chief Bal Thackerays son Uddhav.

 Pawar suggested to Rane that he should not hurry as many other Sena leaders, unhappy with the partys state of affairs, were making overtures to the NCP. We wanted him to wait until the internal churning in the Sena gathers momentum, said a senior NCP leader.

 Several Sena legislators and three members of Parliament, including former Union minister Suresh Prabhu and Subodh Mohite, are also understood to have sent feelers to the NCP.

 However, according to an NCP leader, Uddhav got wind of Ranes meeting with Pawar and this prompted the Sena chief to wield the stick on Rane quickly.

 The NCP views Ranes expulsion as an attempt to contain dissent.

 Rane is welcome to the NCP, party spokesperson D.P. Tripathi said here this evening, adding that the admission of the former chief minister into the party would be discussed with the state leadership.

 A definite view would be taken after Pawars return to the country on July 8 from Brazil, said Tripathi, who is expected to visit Mumbai shortly for consultations.

 The Congress, which recently admitted former Sena Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Nirupam, is also keeping a close watch on the internal Sena tussle. The party leadership may also be keen on roping in some of Sena leaders, said a source.

 However, the Congress general secretary in charge of Maharashtra affairs, Margaret Alva, merely said wait and watch when asked whether the party leadership would approach Rane to join the Congress. She predicted a vertical split in the Sena in the wake of Ranes expulsion.

 The NCP and the Congress, partners in the ruling Democratic Front government in Maharashtra, are keen on strengthening their base in the Konkan region that has been the Senas bastion for over a decade. 

 At present, the NCP has hardly any base in the region. Having emerged as the single-largest party in the October Assembly polls, it is making a bid to expand its base.

 Telengana threats backfire on duo

 Hyderabad, Sept. 21: A city court has asked police to file cases against Union ministers K. Chandrasekhar Rao and A. Narendra for their threats of bloodshed and elimination of anti-Telenganites.

 A petition had drawn the attention of the third chief metropolitan magistrate, Gurappa, to the two Telengana Rashtra Samiti leaders provocative statements.

 The petition alleged the ministers had threatened bloodshed and said they would use weapons like AK-47s against those who opposed (their statehood movement for) Telengana.

 The petition has been referred to Banjara Hills police station, which has jurisdiction over the locality where the TRSs headquarters and Raos home are situated.

 The TRS and the state Congress, once allies, have been on the warpath ever since chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy openly opposed the demand for a Telengana state. 

 The Congress has also objected to the TRS forming a militant wing, Telengana Jagran Sena, calling it a cocktail of Maoists and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activists.

 The TRS walked out of the Congress-led state government in July to protest the delay in tabling a legislation in Parliament for a separate state. We would have walked out of the central government as well but for the request of Sharad Pawar and intervention of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rao had said.

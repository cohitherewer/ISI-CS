The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Market research, mohalla wise

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, May 7: All syndicated studies in the country so far have been providing data on the spending power of New Delhi, Mumbai or Calcutta. Or at least, Delhi and Mumbai. Has any one zoomed in on the spending power of Hauz Khas alone? 

 With an eye on the need for specific data pertaining to a locality for the launch or performance of a product for upcoming industry sectors like banking services, ATMs, supermarkets or customer contact cells, a new market research method has come up.

 Introducing I-Lap at the Indian Readership Survey (IRS) 2005 this week, the Media Research Users Council and Hansa Research, which carried out the survey, said the time is now ripe to provide data on the purchasing power of particular localities. 

 So a lot of India has been mapped, almost household by household, with the figures indicating the buying power of a Hauz Khas as well as a Shyamapukur in Calcutta. 

 In Hauz Khas alone, 250 households have been surveyed, and for the whole of New Delhi, the sample size is 9,700. ?This is a far bigger survey size for market research in India than any other,? said a Hansa Research spokesperson. 

 I-Lap ? the IRS Local Area Potential ? has broken 62 cities and towns into 466 smaller areas. Mumbai has been divided into 30 areas, New Delhi into 28, Calcutta into 31, Chennai into 16, and so on. 

 It is intended to provide clients, especially corporate sectors like banking services, restaurants, supermarkets, malls, department stores, customer contact cells or multiplexes, to identify localities for their business where they can strike a goldmine. 

 Measuring affluence (or in more cases, the lack of it) with the help of the household premium index (HPI), a new tool has been launched simultaneously to grade the buying and spending power of households more through the actual physical properties. 

 The index uses 50-odd parameters, like a detailed measure of household goods, use of banking, telephony, Internet, as also education, to measure spending power much more accurately than the current socio-economic classification (SEC) system ?universally? accepted in India. 

 For financial institutions, it provides information on current banking density in an area, by arriving at a ratio between households having a bank account and total number of households in an area and suggests better city locations. 

 For a washing machine brand, it can provide information on the number of households that have a television and refrigerator but not a washing machine. 

 The survey confirms the worst suspicions in detail. The differences between localities in Calcutta and Mumbai or Delhi or several non-metros stare blatantly. 

 Malviya Nagar, Vasant Vihar, Hauz Khas, R.K. Puram and Gulmohar areas in New Delhi score a household premium index of 88.5. While Belgachhia West, Cossipore and Shyamapukur areas in Calcutta score 18.8.

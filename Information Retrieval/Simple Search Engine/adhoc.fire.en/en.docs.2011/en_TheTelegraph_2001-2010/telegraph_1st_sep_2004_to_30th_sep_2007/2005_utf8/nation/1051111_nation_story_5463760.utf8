 Buddha celebration

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: At a time when Dalit rights activists are resorting to mass conversion to Buddhism as a way to escape caste identities, the government, too, has decided to rediscover Buddhism, reports our special correspondent.

 A national committee has been set up under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to celebrate the 2,550th anniversary of Mahaparinirvana of Lord Buddha. Mahaparinirvana usually refers to the state of everlasting peace and happiness entered by the Buddha at the moment of physical death.

 The committee, which was announced today, has culture minister Jaipal Reddy as vice-chairman and 38 other members, including former Prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Left leaders Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan. It has been mandated to chalk out programmes for celebration of the anniversary .

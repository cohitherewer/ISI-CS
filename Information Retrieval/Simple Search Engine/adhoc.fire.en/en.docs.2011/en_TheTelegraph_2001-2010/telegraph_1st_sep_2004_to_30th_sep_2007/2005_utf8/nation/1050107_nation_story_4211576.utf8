 Cloud on Gaya Red Cross

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Jan. 6: Umesh Agrawal, joint secretary of the Gaya unit of the Indian Red Cross Society, has resigned from his post to protest against alleged irregularities in the distribution of wheelchairs, tricycles and other tools meant for free distribution among beneficiaries living below poverty line. He has also given up his executive committee membership.

 In his resignation letter addressed to Gaya district magistrate Chaitanya Prasad, Agrawal alleged that the Gaya unit was not observing the rules and the irregularities have put a question mark on the organisation?s credibility.

 He also complained that the stock and distribution registers were manipulated and tampered with and the wheelchairs and other tools distributed in violation of the accepted norms. For the past few months, Agrawal has been trying to fix responsibility but in vain, he added.

 According to Agrawal, the wheelchairs, tricycles and other tools were the property of the National Institute for the Visually Handicapped and the Indian Red Cross Society was assigned the task of distributing these items among physically-challenged people in Gaya.

 Talking to The Telegraph, Agrawal said he was pained to see the deterioration in the functioning of the agency and alleged that some private medical practitioners of the town are using the Red Cross platform for personal gains and to get more patients. In the process, the outdoor clinic run by the Red Cross Society has lost its ?sanctity and relevance?.

 More trouble is brewing in the Gaya Red Cross unit, as some life members are not happy with the appointment of R. Kumar as secretary. Kumar has been to jail on charges of fraud. 

 DM Prasad, who is also the ex-officio chairman of the Gaya Red Cross, said the joint secretary and the secretary were not on the best of terms for quite some time and several attempts were made by the standing committee to iron out differences between the two. Asked about his opinion on the allegations of Agrawal, the DM said he did not have the details.

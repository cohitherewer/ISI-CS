The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left?s pet soundbite

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: The 

 CPM has raised the pitch of its protests against the government?s 

 policies of economic liberalisation on the eve of the Union 

 budget to be presented in the Lok Sabha at the end of this 

 month.

 Senior politburo member Sitaram Yechury today launched a biting attack on the United Progressive Alliance government, signalling the CPM will not allow the government to breathe freely ? even though political compulsions prevent it from pulling it down.

 ?We are watchdogs and not anybody?s pet dog. When they (watchdogs) bark, the government will have to listen. If it does not, the dog will bite which will be too harsh,? he said at a seminar which was part of the CPM?s four- day state conference in Kerala. This is not the first time that Yechury has used intemperate language against the government. 

 He triggered a controversy in the initial days of the UPA government when, in a television interview, Yechury warned the government that the Left knows ?not only to bark but also to bite?.

 The interviewer, Karan Thapar, had asked Yechury what the Left would do in case the government hiked the FDI cap in telecom and insurance. Yechury responded with a similar ?bark-and-bite? warning.

 The government, however, has gone ahead and increased the cap to 79 per cent in telecom. 

 Yechury thinks it is time to repeat the stinging warning. The government has proposed FDI for the banking and power sectors and for the print media notwithstanding the Left?s protests.

 Yechury?s remarks came just ahead of the Left?s breakfast meeting with the Prime Minister this Thursday. 

 It appears the CPM is making a calculated move in stepping up its anti-Congress rhetoric not only because of the Centre?s disregard for the Left?s suggestion on economic policies but also in view of the Bengal and Kerala Assembly elections in 2006.

 In Kerala, where Yechury let loose the attack, the Congress is the Left?s main adversary. ?The Left would not hesitate to withdraw its support to the government if the Congress fails to adhere to the CMP,? said Yechury.

 Bringing the Prime Minister within the ambit of his attack, the CPM leader said he would do well to ensure that his government?s economic policies shifted towards people?s welfare and not capitalist welfare.

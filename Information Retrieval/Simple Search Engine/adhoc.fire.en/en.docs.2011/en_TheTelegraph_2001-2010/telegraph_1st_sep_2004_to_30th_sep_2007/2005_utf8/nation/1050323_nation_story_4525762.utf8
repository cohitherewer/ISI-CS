 Wagah, March 22: Almost 600 people walked back into their country today in the largest cross-border transfer of Indian prisoners in decades, only weeks before the Pakistan President?s visit to India.

 ?I wanted to make it rich but ended up making the travel agent richer,? said Harish Kumar of Amritsar, who cried unashamedly as he hugged his father Mangu Ram.

 ?I never thought I would ever set foot in India again,? said Harish, one of many who vowed never to leave home again. He was one of the 564 prisoners ? 528 fishermen and 36 other civilians ? who crossed the Radcliffe Line here to freedom and into the waiting arms of weeping relatives.

 The fishermen, most of whom were from Gujarat, had been arrested after straying into Pakistan waters while fishing in the Arabian Sea.

 The others had been duped with promises of lucrative jobs in the west by unscrupulous travel agents. They were pushed into Pakistan by Turkey and Iran where they had found themselves dumped without travel papers.

 Of the 36, 23 are from Punjab and the rest from Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Daman amp; Diu and Gujarat. All of them completed their sentences ranging from one year to five years in jails in Karachi and Lahore.

 ?Never again will I dream big. It is better to get rejected while formally applying for a visa than selling land to pay a travel agent for a harrowing trip to nowhere,? wept Sohan Singh of Jalandhar.

 ?Another batch of 120 prisoners may be released during the next 10 days,? said Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, whose recent visit to Pakistan secured today?s release.

 He received the freed prisoners, most of whom would reach their home in two to three days by train and bus which the state government has arranged for free.

 Their families, including the elderly and children, had been camping near the border for the last two days.

 Among the crowd was 15-year-old Poonam, who had come looking for her father Sarabjeet Singh who had strayed across while drunk. ?I was a toddler when he disappeared,? she said, clutching his photograph. ?I wish they would release him soon.?

 A Pakistan court has sentenced Sarabjeet to death in a terrorism case. A Canadian NGO is trying to secure his release after revelations of a possible case of mistaken identity as Sarabjeet has been named as Manjeet Singh in the case.

 The prisoners, who walked to freedom after completing formalities running into nearly 1,000 pages for each, could not be released yesterday following Pakistan authorities? inability to arrange a train for them from Karachi to Lahore.

 Bus passenger list

 Preparations for the April 7 launch of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service took a major step on Tuesday with the exchange of lists of passengers on the inaugural trip.

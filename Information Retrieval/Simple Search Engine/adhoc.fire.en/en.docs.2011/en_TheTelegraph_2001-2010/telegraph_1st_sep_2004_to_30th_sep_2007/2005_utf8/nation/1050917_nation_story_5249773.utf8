 IIT kinks on ironing table

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: The Joint Advisory Board of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) will meet tomorrow to iron out the kinks in the new selection procedure the government wants to introduce next year.

 The standing committee of the IIT council finalised recommendations of the special task force at its meeting last month. But there are a few issues that need to be resolved and we will deliberate on them in tomorrows meeting, said S.K. Dube, director, IIT Kharagpur. 

 The council has decided to make the JEE less stressful by a switchover to objective-type questions. It will allow a candidate a maximum of two attempts and will make a first division in the plus-two board exams mandatory.

 The task force was formed in 2002 with the objective of overhauling the JEE system. Over 200,000 students take the test every year vying for the 4,000-odd IIT seats across India.

 After approving the task forces proposals, the council ? which includes representatives from the IITs, the ministry of human resource development and eminent scholars ? authorised the advisory board to work out the details.

 We will try and answer questions like what will happen to students who have already cleared their plus-two but dont have first-division marks or its equivalent. All the aspects of the new procedure and its impact will be analysed, said Dube.

 The advisory board, which conducts the test, has already collected details of the syllabuses of all the 38 boards in the country so that the JEE 2006 questions are in keeping with them. 

 Despite the countrywide protests, Dube stressed that the new system would benefit students, especially the needier ones, reducing their dependence on coaching institutes.

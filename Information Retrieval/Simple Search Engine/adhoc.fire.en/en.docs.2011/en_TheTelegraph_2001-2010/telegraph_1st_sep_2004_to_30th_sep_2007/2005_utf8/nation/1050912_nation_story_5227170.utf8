 Mumbai, Sept. 11 (PTI): Preeti Jain, arrested yesterday for allegedly plotting to get film-maker Madhur Bhandarkar killed, was remanded in police custody till September 16.

 The model-turned-aspiring actor was produced before the metropolitan magistrates court in Mazgaon in central Mumbai. She has been held under Sections 115 and 120 B of the IPC, police sources said. These indicate non-bailable offences. 

 In the remand application, the actors narco-analysis and brain-mapping tests were sought, the sources said.

 Preeti had allegedly given a supari (money in advance for contract killing) to Naresh Pardeshi of don Arun Gawlis political party to get Bhandarkar eliminated. 

 Her lawyer earlier said Preeti had gone to Gawlis residence to urge him to raise the issue of her earlier allegations of rape against Bhandarkar in the Maharashtra Assembly ? the don is the MLA from Chinchpokli.

 Pardeshi, also arrested yesterday for allegedly hatching a criminal conspiracy with the model, too, was produced in court today and remanded in police custody till September 16.

 The police said the matter came to their notice when advocate Bagawe, from Gawlis party Akhil Bharatiya Sena, lodged a complaint against Pardeshi at Agripada police station in central Mumbai last week, baring the plot.

 Bagawe alleged that Preeti had contacted Pardeshi, a shakha pramukh (unit chief) of the party, two months ago and wished that Bhandarkar be eliminated. 

 A payment of Rs 70,000 was also made to Pardeshi, Bagawe alleged in his complaint.

 Bhandarkar had told us that he received anonymous calls in the past few months suggesting him to settle all issues (with Preeti), a senior police official said. It is being probed as to who made those calls, he added.

 Preeti had hit the headlines last year when she lodged a complaint of sexual exploitation against Bhandarkar, alleging that he had raped her after promising her a role in films.

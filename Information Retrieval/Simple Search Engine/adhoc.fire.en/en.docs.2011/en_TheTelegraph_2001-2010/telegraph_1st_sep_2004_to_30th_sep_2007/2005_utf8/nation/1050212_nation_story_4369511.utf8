 Fear shoots down poll win

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Feb. 11: The fear of the gun is crowding out elected councillors? love for the chair.

 Shaken by the killing of three corporators after the recent civic polls, two People?s Democratic Party councillors today kicked up a ruckus at the Friday congregation in Anantnag by apologising to the people for having contested the elections.

 ?We seek your forgiveness in the name of Allah and we dissociate from the process. We have resigned our seats and from the party and have nothing to do with the civic bodies,? the duo declared before the crowd, cutting short the imam who was in the middle of a sermon.

 Mushtaq Ahmad Bhat and Ghulam Mohi-ud-din had won the polls from ward 3 and ward 4 of Anantnag town.

 The resignation trend was set by the PDP?s Ghulam Rasool Khan who was elected unopposed from Beerwa in central Budgam district. Two days ago, he announced he was stepping down through an advertisement in a local daily. Seven other Independents and PDP councillors from Beerwa followed him today, similarly announcing their resignations through advertisements.

 The spate of militant attacks and the lack of individual security appear to have created a fear psychosis among the councillors. The National Conference, which won most of the seats in the 68-member Srinagar Municipal Corporation, has threatened to quit en masse if its members are not provided individual security.

 NC chief Omar Abdullah said his party would wait and see if anything is done to provide the councillors security in the next few days. After that, an appropriate decision would be taken, he said.

 ?We are seeking security for all the elected councillors. The polls are only a few days old and see what is happening. Some of our elected councillors are in Jammu while others are putting up with local MLAs. We have put up some elected members in our party headquarters.?

 The panic resignations appear to have been triggered by Wednesday?s killing of NC councillor Mohammad Maqbool Shah, who was elected from Jawahar Nagar ward of Srinagar and was tipped to be mayor.

 Early this week, another PDP corporator was abducted from Beerwa and killed.

 Although the security issue is snowballing into a row, chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had recently said the sheer number of persons elected to local bodies made it impossible to provide each one individual security.

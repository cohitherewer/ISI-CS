 Exam ban on college official

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, May 22: The Bihar Intermediate Education Council (BIEC) has debarred Ghulam Samdani, principal of MG College, from all examination-related work for the remaining period of his service. Samdani is scheduled to retire in January 2012. 

 Confirming the decision to blacklist the principal, BIEC chairman Nageshwar Sharma told The Telegraph that the step was taken on the basis of an inquiry into allegations of malpractice committed during a home science practical examination in 2004.

 Samdani, who was the centre superintendent, was accused of manipulating records to favour candidates during the examination and getting the test conducted in the name of Sarwat Ara, former head of the home science department at GBM College, who had died eight years ago. A three-member team comprising senior academicians conducted the inquiry.

 Samdani will not be able to act as centre superintendent, examiner, paper-setter, inquiry officer or invigilator in the remaining seven years of his service.

 During the investigation, chairman of the inquiry committee S.M. Humair Ahmed found out that though Ara had died in 1996, Samdani showed her as having conducted the home science practical examination in April 2004, eight years after her death.

 On the basis of the inquiry report, the council had slapped a showcause notice on Samdani, asking why action should not be taken against him. In his reply to the notice, the principal had said some college employee misled him and obtained his signature on the paper showing Ara as the home science examiner.

 Rejecting Samdanis explanation, the council has debarred him from all examination-related work.

 Lotus row in MP

 Bhopal, Aug. 2: The lotus controversy stalled proceedings for the second consecutive day as Opposition lawmakers forced Speaker Ishwardas Rohani to adjourn the Madhya Pradesh Assembly today, while the ruling BJP hit back with a privilege motion against a Congress MLA, reports our special correspondent.

 The Opposition, which has accused the government of trying to pass off its election symbol as the national flower in a school textbook, raised the subject as soon as the House assembled. The pattern and colour combination of the national flower is different from the BJPs lotus, the Opposition said. 

 But the chair did not allow a discussion. In the turmoil that followed, question hour could not be held. After the adjournment, the Opposition, who yesterday boycotted House proceedings, staged a dharna in front of Rohanis chamber and threatened to move a no-confidence motion against the Speaker tomorrow. 

 As a counter-move, the BJP today moved a privilege motion against Congress MLA Sajjan Singh Verma, who yesterday tore off a paper that carried the lotus symbol. It claimed the other side of the paper carried a print of the national song Vande Mataram and Verma should be tried for insulting it.

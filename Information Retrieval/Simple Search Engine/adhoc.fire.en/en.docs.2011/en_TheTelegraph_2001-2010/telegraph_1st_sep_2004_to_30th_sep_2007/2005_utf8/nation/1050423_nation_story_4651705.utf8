 No sanyas from struggle, says Surjeet

 Surjeet: Staying right here

 New Delhi, April 22: Harkishen Singh Surjeet has said he is not taking ?sanyas? from political life.

 The statement comes at a time when politicians of all hues and age are ?threatening? to retire from active politics and then turning back on their word.

 Soon after the former general secretary of the CPM gave way to a younger generation of leadership, RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan virtually ?ordered? the BJP?s two most well-known faces ? Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani ? to retire and yield space to a younger leadership. 

 Next, Uma Bharti, the BJP?s taciturn leader from Madhya Pradesh, said she would retire from politics. Within 48 hours, she said she would not retire because her guru has asked her to continue in politics.

 Surjeet, however, is in no such dilemma. In an article in the People?s Democracy ? the CPM mouthpiece ? he has written: ?My offer to step down (from the post of general secretary) did not mean that I have visualised any sanyas from party and political life.?

 Earlier this month, the 87-year-old leader quit the post and 56-year-old Prakash Karat took charge at the end of the 18th party congress. 

 ?My only point was that somebody else should come forward to shoulder this responsibility,? said Surjeet. ?As for myself, I said in clear-cut terms that I would continue to contribute to the struggle in whatever way I can.?

 Surjeet has said communists do not retire from politics. In his article, he vowed to continue to contribute to the movement. ?I do give my pledge that I would continue to contribute my mite to the cause of the toiling people.?

 Before the party congress, Jyoti Basu had requested the CPM leadership to allow him to retire from the politburo. However, at the end of it, Karat said both Basu and Surjeet had been asked to continue in the politburo so that the party could gain from their rich political experience.

 Surjeet has echoed a similar sentiment in the article. ?I have been actively associated with the peasant movement and worked with the stalwarts of this movement like Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, N.G. Ranga and Indulal Yajnik,? wrote the veteran leader.

 ?I have first-hand experience of the misery that was and still is of the Indian peasantry. This is what made me accept the necessity of an agrarian revolution.?

 This is also what made him a ?life-long fighter?, Surjeet pointed out. ?And this is what makes me give the pledge that I would remain a fighter till I breathe my last.?

 Surjeet became a politburo member more than five decades ago in 1953. He headed the party as general secretary for four terms from 1992.

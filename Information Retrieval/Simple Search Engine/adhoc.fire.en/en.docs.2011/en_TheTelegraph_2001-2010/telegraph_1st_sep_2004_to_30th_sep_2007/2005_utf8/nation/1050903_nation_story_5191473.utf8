 Islamabad, Sept. 2: After buses, India and Pakistan have agreed to allow trucks to run between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad to strengthen trade ties between the two Kashmirs.

 The frequency of the bus service, which started in April, will also be raised and a new one started between Poonch and Rawalkot. Meetings between technical experts of the two countries will start in the coming days.

 The agreements came with the underlined Indian demand that Pakistan deliver on its commitment to completely stop cross-border terrorism from its soil and territories under its control.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran, who met President Pervez Musharraf this morning, welcomed his assurance not to allow terrorism and violence to hobble the peace process.

 Musharraf is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 14. The two are expected to not only review the peace process but also talk about additional steps to keep it on track.

 The joint statement at the end of the foreign secretaries meeting said the third round of the composite dialogue will start next January when Saran meets his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Mohammed Khan in Delhi.

 Officials engaged in the other six subjects (that is, apart from Kashmir) of the composite dialogue will meet between January and July next year. The two sides have agreed on a tight schedule to complete all technical-level talks by April 2006.

 They have agreed to soon restart the Joint Commission, with its preliminary session scheduled early next month.

 Saran said though there could be no territorial adjustments to settle the Kashmir dispute, India is committed to finding a final solution acceptable to both countries.

 We want to reach the final destination. But at the moment we dont know what that destination will be, he said.

 Till a solution is found, however, the neighbours must take steps to reduce the impact of the division of Kashmir among the people of the state. The bus service and the proposed truck service are being taken with that in mind.

 This is the manner in which you can create a virtuous circle and I think that process is taking place.

 India and Pakistan have agreed to hold further discussions on the meeting points across the Line of Control where divided families can reunite at regular intervals.

 The outcome of the foreign secretaries meeting and Sarans later interaction with Musharraf suggest that neither side is willing to walk away from the dialogue.

 The talks calendar implies that at least till the middle of next year, the two sides will remain engaged and keep the peace process on track.

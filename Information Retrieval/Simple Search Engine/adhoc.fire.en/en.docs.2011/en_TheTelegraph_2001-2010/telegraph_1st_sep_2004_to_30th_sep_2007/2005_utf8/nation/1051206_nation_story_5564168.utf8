 Mumbai, Dec. 5: B for Bihar and B for Belgaum. Its back to basics for the warring Thackeray cousins. 

 Anti-Bihari tirade could provide Raj Thackeray with the firepower to launch a proposed new organisation, while the Uddhav camp plans to exploit the touchy issue of the Marathi-speaking Karnataka town of Belgaums merger with Maharashtra. 

 The opportunity to exploit the anti-outsider sentiment presented itself before Raj yesterday when a group of medical students from JJ Hospitals Grant Medical College met him to complain about what was essentially a campus brawl between two groups of students. 

 The groups clashed over the use of toilet facilities at the college hostel. The issue quickly turned into a Marathi-speaking students versus non-Marathi students and the delegation of 70-odd students rushed to Raj to seek his intervention. 

 Raj, who led the Shiv Sena students union till his resignation last Sunday, issued a warning that attacks on Marathi-speaking students from outsiders would not be tolerated. 

 He also spoke to JJ Hospital dean Dr Pravind Shingare, who had already ordered an inquiry into the campus brawl and promised action. 

 Raj had planned to visit JJ Hospital today, but decided against it. The JJ Hospital dean has promised us that he would inquire and take action. We have decided to wait and see what the hospital does, said Pravin Darekar of the Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena and one of Rajs close associates. 

 Police later arrested 16 medical students for alleged rioting.

 The Sena had flaunted the anti-outsider plank in 2003 when Uddhav unveiled the Mee Mumbaikar campaign to garner support from non-Maharashtrian voters in the run-up to the 2004 Assembly polls.

 But when Rajs supporters beat up students from Bihar who came to Mumbai for a railway recruitment examination, it irked the increasing north Indian vote bank and resulted in derailing Uddhavs Mee Mumbaikar campaign.

 Rajs followers have shown the penchant for violence twice in the past week. 

 Although he deferred his plans to announce his future course of action by a few more days, Raj is rumoured to have planned an organisation, possibly non-political, to address issues concerning Maharashtrian cultural pride, the original ideology of the Shiv Sena before it made a truck with the BJP and turned saffron. 

 The Sena started as a non-political organisation to protect Maharashtrians against the influx of outsiders.

 Uddhav and his supporters have trained their guns on the old issue of Belgaum, which dominated Maharashtra politics five decades ago before the state of Maharashtra came into being in 1960.

 The immediate provocation came when Sena leader and Belgaums mayor Vijay More spearheaded a drive for Belgaums merger with Maharashtra, and passed a resolution to that effect. 

 To counter the move, the Dharam Singh government dissolved the Belgaum Municipal Corporation. Though all four political parties in Maharashtra support the demand for the merger of Belgaums Marathi-speaking areas with Maharashtra, Uddhav and the Sena led a delegation to meet governor S.M. Krishna, a former Karnataka chief minister, last week.

 In the coming weeks, the Sena will try to stoke the old fire among its cadre over this.

 ?Contradiction? puts top cop in spot

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, March 27: Gaya police are busy washing their dirty linen in public these days, unmindful of its effects on their morale and public image.

 With district police chief Sanjay Singh publicly blaming deputy superintendent of police (city) Mansoor Ahmed for the submission of contradictory reports in a case of dowry-related torture, the ongoing ?war of nerves? between the two senior cops is out in the open.

 The case, in which one Shamima Khatoon accused her in-laws of inflicting dowry-related torture on her as well as trying to strangulate her, has become a source of embarrassment for the police over the submission of contradictory reports by Singh and issues of propriety and professionalism.

 The SP, despite putting the blame on Ahmed, will not find the going easy. In one report, he found the complaint lodged by Khatoon with Kotwali police station (case no. 87/04) to be true. But, the same officer subsequently said the allegations were false. 

 The faux pas, besides showing the investigation in poor light, raises a few points as well. One among them is that if the police are to go by Singh?s contention (that the allegations are false), then the suspension of the investigating officer on charges of dereliction of duty and the subsequent arrest of two of the accused ? who spent several months in jail ? were acts of gross injustice. In that case, is there any mechanism to undo the damage, ask some sources.

 Now, it is for the top brass to make a final pronouncement based on facts and ensure that the ?in-house? problems of Gaya police are not taken to the streets, as such acts further erode the credibility of an already demoralised force, said a retired police officer.

 Moreover, it would be interesting to see if Khatoon?s case was the only one in which the same officer submitted contradictory reports and someone else paid the price for such indiscretion.

 If police sources are to be believed, a can of worms exists in the police department and it only requires someone to loosen the lid and expose the rot. Even Supreme Court reprimands have failed to make Gaya police mend their ways. A case in point was the Bara massacre case in which Justice M.B. Shah had found the investigation to be ?faulty, casual, delayed and unscientific?.

 Child bride waits for groom and divorce

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 13: The child bride sat before the village temple, surrounded by an assortment of wedding gifts, waiting in vain for the groom.

 It wasnt 16-year-old Susheelas marriage, however, that was to be formalised on Tuesday but her divorce.

 Married off against her will in October 2003 to maternal uncle Narasimhulu, the girl from Telengana had made history on June 12 this year, winning her right to get a divorce at a panchayat meeting.

 The husband was to meet her with his family at her village, Alur, yesterday to return the dowry, as dictated by the panchayat meeting. The couple would sign a document formally annulling the marriage and Susheela would hand back the wedding gifts she received from her in-laws.

 Susheelas family, panchayat members of Alur and a group of social activists waited for five hours at the Venkateswaraswamy temple, with her wedding ring, mangalsutram, silk saree and silver ornaments neatly packed. But there was no sign of the party from Prodattur village.

 According to a written pledge given to the panchayat, Narasimhulu is to return the dowry amount of Rs 35,000 as well as all other gifts from the brides family, including gold ornaments and utensils.

 My husband had insisted on the gold and cash, Susheela said. She had hardly had a chance to wear the ornaments, though, because Narasimhulu pawned them four months after the wedding.

 What ornaments did she have? The girl, who turned 16 five days ago, said: I had double-lotus earrings studded with stones and a gold pendant.

 We shall write to them or send a courier to bring back the gifts, said panchayat chief Pandaraiah. As for the divorce, we consider it a closed chapter. Susheela can marry again.

 Activists of MV Foundation, an NGO battling child marriage, said they had found out that Narasimhulu had failed to raise the money to redeem the pawned ornaments.

 Susheela, who has been living with her parents since she left her husband eight months ago, has enrolled herself in class VIII at a local school. 

 I will continue to study even if I have to work in the cotton fields to pay the fees, she said.

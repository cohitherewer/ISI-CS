 Second driver in focus

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Ayodhya, July 7: From Rehan Khan, the last-mile link, the focus has shifted to Rajkumar, the man 60 kilometres away.

 Rajkumar, whose vehicle the militants hired in Akbarpur for their Ayodhya mission, told police that the five did not look exhausted when they reserved his car early on July 5, the day of the attack.

 They, in fact, looked fresh, he added.

 The comment prompted the investigators to take Rajkumar, his driver Yunus, and Rehan to Akbarpur last night as it suggested that the militants may have stayed there the night before.

 The sleuths took note of the place where the militants hired Rajkumars car and then questioned local residents. The police suspect the militants had contacts in Akbarpur.

 They said the militants hired Rajkumars vehicle in Akbarpur and abandoned it in Faizabad, from where they took an auto-rickshaw to Ayodhya. In Ayodhya, they hired Rehans jeep, which was blown up.

 Rajkumar, whose description of the militants matched Rehans, said it was only yesterday that he came to know that the militants had used his car, which he has not got back yet. According to the police, the car is in their custody.

 The investigators believe the Akbarpur link is a major clue and are trying to find out if some contacts of the militants in Akbarpur were in touch with their counterparts in Ayodhya. The militants have not yet been identified but we are working on a couple of leads, senior superintendent of police, Faizabad, Avinash Chandra said. 

 Chandra said the police have learnt that Rehan had gone to Dubai five years ago and bought two vehicles after he returned. The sleuths are trying to find out where Rehan worked and how he made his money.

 But the police refused to confirm whether Rehan was carrying in his bag 20 AK-47 cartridges which a CRPF jawan claimed to have seized from him. Rehan had reportedly said the cartridges were pushed into his bag by the militants.

 Left springs Maoist surprise

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Feb. 5: India?s apprehensions over the growing influence of Nepal?s Maoists notwithstanding, the Left today made it clear that it is willing to express solidarity even with the armed rebels if they fight for restoration of democracy in their country.

 ?If Maoists want to restore democracy in Nepal, we are willing to show solidarity even with them,? CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said this afternoon after a meeting with other Left and socialist parties on the Nepal coup.

 South Block has always stressed that Nepal?s stability and progress hinge on the twin pillars of constitutional monarchy and democracy and any imbalance can lead to expansion of Maoist influence.

 The fact that Maoists have already started taking advantage of the turmoil to lead the fight against the king has begun to worry the Indian establishment. Fears that a large number of Nepalese people, including Maoists, might now cross over to India has prompted Delhi to step up vigilance along its borders.

 The meeting called upon the Centre to make it clear to Kathmandu that ?this palace coup is unacceptable?, the Left said in a statement. 

 It has also decided to hold a national convention on February 24 in the capital.

 The Congress was left out of today?s meeting, which was attended by the CPI, Forward Bloc, RSP, Nationalist Congress Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (Secular), Samajwadi Party and the CPI (ML).

 Yechury pointed out that only those parties that have jointly fought in the past for restoration of democracy in Nepal were invited today.

 Although the meeting strongly condemned King Gyanendra?s action, Yechury said ?we leave to the government to decide what steps it should take to ensure the early return of democracy in Nepal?.

 The Nepal crisis also came up for discussion at a meeting of the National Security Advisory Board, chaired by the new national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan. Members of the board threw up several opinions, with some saying a tough stand should be taken against Gyanendra to keep India?s credentials with Nepal?s political parties intact.

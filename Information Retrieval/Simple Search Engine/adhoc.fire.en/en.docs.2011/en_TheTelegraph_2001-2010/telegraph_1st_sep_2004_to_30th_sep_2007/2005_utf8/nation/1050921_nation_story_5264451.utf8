 Preeti case arrests

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 20: Police today arrested two more persons on the charge of accepting a contract to kill director Madhur Bhandarkar even as a top official of the force hinted at a larger probe into extortion rackets run by don-turned-MLA Arun Gawli.

 Shivam Arjun Das, 24, and Satish Mohite, 30, were picked up from their hideouts in the city a little after four in the morning. They were later produced in court and remanded in police custody till September 30.

 The police seized a country-made revolver from Mohite. Das has a kidnapping case against him.

 These are the people who were hired to fire upon Bhandarkar, joint commissioner (law and order) Arup Patnaik said. 

 Since a country-made revolver is an unreliable weapon, they even fired a bullet to test whether it works fine. We recovered the empty case from Naresh Pardeshis house. They were hired by Pardeshi, who accepted Rs 75,000 from (Preeti) Jain for the contract killing.

 Pardeshi and model-turned-aspiring-actor Preeti were arrested earlier this month.

 Bangalore, Feb. 8: The presence of a dozen flying machines and as many aerospace companies of the US at Aero India 2005 signals their intention to pitch for a pie of the Indian aviation market. 

 Some of these big-ticket players are exploring options of outsourcing components sub-systems and components to India during the five-day show beginning tomorrow. 

 Unlike a symbolic presence in the past ? in 1999 US firms skipped the show following the Pokhran II sanctions ? several leading companies have flown in defence and civilian hardware this year. These include F 15E Strike Eagle jet fighter, P-3C Orion anti-submarine warfare patrol aircraft and C-130 Hercules transport aircraft (all Lockheed Martin), KC 135 Stratotanker (air-to-air refuelling) of Boeing and Bell Helicopter. 

 Northrop Grumman plans to market the E2C Hawkeye surveillance aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF) during the event. Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, Raytheon Company, Gulfstream and Moog Aircraft Group are the other key companies at the air show. 

 A spokesperson for the US Department of Defense said Lockheed Martin would shortly address the IAF?s request for information on the F-16 fighter jets. ?We are ready for co-production, should the IAF decide to acquire the F-16. We have done that in some cases for other customers,? the spokesperson said. 

 The IAF has short-listed four fighters ? F-16 (US), MiG 29 (Russia), Mirage-2000-5 (France) and Jas Grippen-39 (Sweden) ? for its planned acquisition of 126 aircraft. 

 At a news conference here, US ambassador David Mulford said: ?We are interested in becoming a major player in the sub-continent. The Department of Defense supports the sale of US systems overseas that promote our national security interests.? 

 Mulford said the decision not to display F-16 fighters did not tantamount to lack of interest in the IAF?s expansion plans. 

 ?There is a significant US presence at the show. US firms are looking at collaborations with Indian companies and to sourcing major systems from here,? said Shekar Dutt, secretary of defence production, on the eve of the show. 

 About 352 aerospace and aviation firms, including 126 from India, are participating. Thirty-one countries including China, Israel, the US and UK are sending their delegation for the exposition.

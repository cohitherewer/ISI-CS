 Planes to cool anti-US anger

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, March 26: Pakistan feels that the decision to clear the sale of F-16s will not only open up a new chapter in defence cooperation with the US but also help cool ?anti-American sentiments?.

 ?The US government has conveyed its decision to Islamabad and we will soon submit the bill before Parliament,? Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said, terming it a ?red-letter day? for the Pakistan Air Force.

 The proposed sale ends nearly two decades of stalemate after former US President George Bush suspended Pakistan?s economic and military aid, including the delivery of F-16s, over its nuclear programme and slapped sanctions under the Pressler law.

 Former US senator Larry Pressler, after whom the legislation was named, dubbed as ?unwise? Washington?s decision to resume delivery of the warplanes to Pakistan and said the move could fuel tensions in South Asia.

 Pakistan information minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad said the US will deliver the most advanced C and D versions of F-16s, being flown by Nato countries.

 The decision is also the first significant vindication of Pakistan?s status as a major non-NATO ally, granted by the Bush administration last year for the country?s role in the ongoing war on terror. 

 Defence analysts in Pakistan have termed the decision a ?positive development? in Pakistan-US defence ties.

 ?This will help upgrade Pakistan Air Force and will contribute to improving Pak-US relations,? Professor Hassan Askari Rizvi said. He believes the decision will also considerably defuse the anti-US sentiments that have increased in recent years, especially after military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

 ?There was an anti-American campaign by some of the political parties who complain that the US was not helping Pakistan?s security in return for its contribution to US security,? he said.

 However, defence analysts felt that the balance of power, especially in conventional weapons, would remain tilted towards India, though the F-16s may marginally ?reduce the Indian superiority?. 

 Many Pakistanis greeted the news with surprise as well as excitement. ?This is really great. I had prayed to God Almighty that our country may get more F-16s while watching aerobatics by this magnificent jet during the Pakistan Day parade on March 23,? said Tazeem Zafar, a student in Islamabad.

 Foreign ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani tried to address Indian concerns, saying it will be appropriate for Delhi to enter into comprehensive discussions on security and stability.

 Prime Minister Aziz said: ?Pakistan does not foster any aggressive designs against any country.?

New Delhi, June 21: Sonal Mansingh, who was removed as chairperson of the Sangeet Natak Akademi earlier this month, is trying to distance herself from the previous BJP-led regime that appointed her in December 2003.

 The danseuse, who was accused by former CPM general secretary H.S. Surjeet of being an appointee of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, today denied links with the parivar.

 In April, 60 artistes had approached President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and submitted a memorandum demanding Mansinghs immediate removal for her autocratic behaviour.

 The memorandum accused her of saffron links as she had campaigned for Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee through signed advertisements during the NDAs India Shining campaign.

 Mansingh denied the allegation, saying: If I am saffron, I have the moral strength to say that I am. Jaipal Reddy asked me if I campaigned for the BJP. I was not asked before my name was used in that campaign and when someone asked me about it, I had objected to its use.

 Asked why she did not complain to the Election Commission, Mansingh said: I am always on tour and I have so many other things to do, I did not think of it.

 Quizzed on her perceived saffron leanings, she replied: There is nothing wrong in being rooted to the culture of ones existence. If knowing and speaking Sanskrit is saffron, I am saffron. At the same time, I would not like to belittle the soldiers and others who salute the saffron part of our flag. Are we going to chop it?

 Asked if she would take legal action against the Left leader, Mansingh said: Let me think. I will wait and watch.

 Referring to Alexander Solzhenitsyns book Gulag Archipelago to make her point, Mansingh said: I wonder what the real agenda is. It is an attack on the cultural traditions of India. Is it a way to denigrate those who uphold the cultural values of India, who revel in it? I hope the Indian comrades do not want to create a cultural gulag ? a cultural desert in India.

 Surjeets article, she added, had sown the seeds of the movement to oust me.

 Sacrifice charge 

 Bhubaneswar, May 11: Orissa finance minister Prafulla Ghadei was today caught in a storm after a person accused him of sacrificing his 14-year-old son, reports our correspondent.

 Haladhar Mahanta, of Nator village in Jajpur district, has alleged that his teenaged son Bholeswar was sacrificed in the ministers house, where he was sent to work as a domestic help.

 Mahanta said in the affidavits that Bholeswar was missing since February 6, the day his sister-in-law Sanjulata and another woman came to his house. 

 They took my son while assuring my wife that he will be employed as a babysitter for the ministers grandson in Bhubaneswar. When I went to the ministers residence after 19 days, I was told that my son was in the house of one Samrat Gupta in Kaliapani, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Nation at a Glance

 Sunny film pulled off screens

 Chandigarh: Within hours of the Shiromani 

 Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) demanding a ban on 

 Jo Bole So Nihal, distributors withdrew the film 

 from theatres across Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, reports 

 our correspondent. 

 The SGPC also demanded that TV serials depicting Sikhs or their way of life be submitted to the organisation for approval before telecast.

 The movie is giving the Sikh religion a bad name. It is also damaging the Sikh psyche, SGPC president Jagir Kaur said after a meeting of Sikh organisations on Thursday.

 Producer Ponty Chadha said any suggestions from 

 the SGPC was welcome. His brother I.P.S. Chadha said: We 

 have sent a telegram message to the theatres running this 

 film to stop its screening immediately. 

 The Sunny Deol-starrer has been greeted with threats and stones in Punjab and some other parts of the country since its release on May 13. 

 This is not a religious film. The phrase jo bole so nihal is sacred to the Sikhs. We would not have objected had the film been a religious one, Kaur said.

 In Mumbai, director Rahul Rawail insisted that his film does not belittle the community. There was no intention to hurt the Sikhs. The hero of the film is a Sikh and it would be stupid to even attempt to belittle Sikhs, he said, adding that he himself is a Sikh.

 Cops quiz Mumbai bookie

 Mumbai: Police on Thursday detained bookie Ashok Kamdar alias Ashok Royal from the Malad area here in connection with ongoing investigations into betting rackets and cricket match-fixing, reports our correspondent.

 Crime branch officials brought him to the Crawford Market headquarters. They did not disclose any details of his detention.

 One of the 12 big bookies operating from the city, Kamdar is the fifth person to be picked up for interrogation. Nemichand Jain and Shobhan Mehta were arrested earlier in connection with the busting of an illegal telephone booth, which police suspect was being used to place bets.

 Teacher held for cheating 

 Sirsa (PTI): A primary school teacher 

 in Haryana has been held for duping a youth in the pretext

When Singh demanded his money back, he was given only Rs 3.75 lakh. Rajbala said the rest of the money was spent on visits to Chandigarh and Delhi to procure his visa. 

 Namaaz cap nod

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has 

 said there is no restriction on a lawyer wearing headgear

 complained to the court authorities that he was restrained 

 by a high court division bench from arguing his case as 

 he was wearing a namaaz cap.

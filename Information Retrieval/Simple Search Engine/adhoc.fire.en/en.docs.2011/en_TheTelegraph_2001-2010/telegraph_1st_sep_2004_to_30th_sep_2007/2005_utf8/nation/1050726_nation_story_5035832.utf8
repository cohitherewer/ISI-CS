 Kiss and patch-up reports snipped

 - Imran 

 hairdresser says no chance of reunion with Jemima 

 AMIT ROY

 Where are they headed? 

 Imran and Jemima in happier times 

 London, July 25: Todays Daily Mail quotes Dar, a Pakistani hairdresser and friend of cricketer Imran Khan, as saying that there is no chance that Jemima and Imran will ever get back together.

 This reverses a story published yesterday in the Daily Mails sister paper, the Mail on Sunday, that Imran had not ruled out a possible reconciliation with his ex-wife.

 But, then, 24 hours is a long time in British tabloid journalism. The rule is simple: Never let facts get in the way of a good story.

 And the story so far is as follows: Following her divorce from Imran, Jemima took up with the actor Hugh Grant. He had previously gone out for 13 years with actress Liz Hurley who then took up with Indian Arun Nayar.

 In fact, Jemima may have started her relationship with Grant even before her divorce. She also saw to it that her increasing physical intimacy with Grant was recorded in great detail by paparazzi photographers. This may have been to signal to Liz that Grant was now hers. But at a recent party, Liz sucked Grants thumbs.

 At this, Jemima felt humiliated, had a row with Grant, told him to f... off, words she did not use when she was a good Muslim wife, and strode off into the sunset.

 Now read on...

 Imran, according to the Mail on Sunday, has now told friends, who conveniently happened to be passing, that he still cares deeply for his ex-wife and has not ruled out a reconciliation. He would also consider living between London and Lahore to try to become a normal family again, it was said.

 Imran, 51, who is over 20 years older than his ex-wife, allegedly told a friend who also happened to be passing: I still love Jemima. Its basically up to her what she wants to do with her life. We have remained close for the sake of the family unit because we always wanted to create the best situation for our children.

 Imran and Jemima apparently still speak on the phone and have had numerous conversations since her high-profile affair with Grant hit a rough patch.

 Yesterdays report also claimed that Jemima, 31, has been in regular touch with Imran and they are planning to holiday together at the Goldsmiths Spanish retreat this month with their sons, Sulaiman, eight, and Qasim, four.

 Some suggest that yesterdays report may have been planted by people close to Jemima to indicate she, too, could flirt with her ex. 

 However, todays Daily Mail has knocked this happy story on the head.

 It says that Imran has invited Lady Annabel, widow of the late maverick businessman Sir James Goldsmith, for a holiday at his palatial home in Lahore, with her sons, Zac and Ben, plus Sulaiman and Qasim. However, Jemima will be missing.

 Dar, the hairdresser, says: It is great for their (Imrans and Jemimas) sons that the two families can mix even when their mother is not there.

 The Daily Mail also says that Jemima has refused Grants offer of marriage. 

 There is only one personality missing from this story - Arun Nayar. He dumped his Italian wife for Liz but so far they have not married. But according to the tabloids, they might next year or possibly the one after that. Or possibly not at all.

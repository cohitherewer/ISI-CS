 Tsunami, in an equation

 - Experts try to solve the riddle 

 of the killer waves

 RICK WEISS

 Washington, Jan. 10: Along 

 the shores of Sri Lanka, the tsunami that has killed more 

 than 150,000 people first appeared as a rapidly rising tide, 

 a phenomenon more akin to a quickly filling bathtub than 

 a bona fide wave.

 To the east, on the Thai islands 

 of Phuket and Phi Phi, the same tsunami made landfall as 

 a train of intense, cresting waves that washed ashore with 

 brutal impact.

 And on the little islands of Diego 

 Garcia and Mauritius, east of Madagascar, that very same 

 wave ? barrelling across the Indian Ocean at about 400 mph 

 ? wreaked virtually no damage as it washed by, according 

 to officials. Like the mercurially morphing villain in Terminator 

 2, a tsunami can have many faces.

 Why the apparent capriciousness? 

 The answer, scientists said, lies in a few rules of physics 

 that govern the behaviour of waves as they travel through 

 water. 

 Last month?s disparities started 

 when a plate of the earth?s crust slipped abruptly beneath 

 an adjoining slab of rock under the seas just west of Sumatra.

 Unlike an asteroid impact, which 

 would send out concentric circles of energy in all directions 

 equally, this geologic event was primarily a sideways motion. 

 That meant that from the start, the waves it sent east and 

 west carried much more energy than those headed north or 

 south, said Steven Ward, a geophysicist at the University 

 of California at Santa Cruz, who has generated a detailed 

 computer model of the tsunami?s progression (visible at 

 www.es.ucsc.edu /~ward/indo.mov).

 That reality ? along with the 

 fact that shorelines happened to be closer to the east and 

 west of the epicentre than to the north or south ? helps 

 explain why vulnerable countries to the far north and south, 

 such as Bangladesh and Mauritius, suffered relatively little, 

 compared with Sri Lanka to the west and Thailand to the 

 east.

 Yet Sri Lanka and Thailand experienced 

 the tsunami very differently, though they both lay along 

 that dangerous east-west axis. Those differences, scientists 

 said, point to the most important determinant of a tsunami?s 

 personality as it comes ashore.

 ?Basically, it?s the shape of 

 the bottom,? said Jeffrey Weissel, a senior research scholar 

 at Columbia University?s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory 

 in New York. In a nutshell, Weissel and others said, land 

 masses that poke abruptly from the deep ocean experience 

 tsunamis as diffusely rising tides, while those bounded 

 by shallower seas get hit by higher, steeper and often more 

 destructive waves.

 At the core of this truth ? as 

 with most truths in physics ? is an equation: v= square 

 root (g times h), where v is the wave?s velocity, g is the 

 force of gravity and h is the depth of the water. In plain 

 English, as the water gets shallower, waves slow down. That 

 is a commonsense observation, but one with an unexpected 

 consequence: These slower waves end up packing extra punch.

 There are two keys to understanding 

 why. One is that a tsunami is not just one wave but a train 

 of waves, typically half a dozen or more, each a little 

 weaker than the one ahead of it but all packing tremendous 

 energy. The waves are generally a few feet high in deep 

 ocean, and their wavelengths ? the distance between the 

 swells ? can be a mile or more.

 When a tsunami?s leading wave 

 slows down as it enters shallower water, others behind it 

 ? still in deep water ? do not. They pile on from behind, 

 shortening the distance between waves and adding to the 

 height of the leading waves, said Andrew Ingersoll, a professor 

 of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology 

 in Pasadena.

 The second key, Ingersoll said, 

 is that the slowing of waves in shallow waters is simply 

 a reflection of how waves behave in limited space. It is 

 not because of friction on the ocean bottom. That is important 

 because it means that, although the wave is slowing, it 

 is not giving up energy. All that energy is being rearranged 

 within a slower but newly steepened wave, not to be released 

 until it hits buildings, trees, people and anything else 

 in its way.

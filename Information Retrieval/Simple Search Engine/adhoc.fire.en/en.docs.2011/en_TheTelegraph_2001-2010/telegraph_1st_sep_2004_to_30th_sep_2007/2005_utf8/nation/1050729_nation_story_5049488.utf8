 HC nod to death for teacher killers

 High Court has upheld the death sentences awarded to five 

 CPM activists convicted of killing a schoolteacher inside 

 his classroom in 1999, reports our correspondent.

 K.T. Jayakrishnan, the then state 

 unit vice-president of the BJPs youth wing, was murdered 

 while taking class under police protection. Eight persons, 

 from both sides, fell to revenge killings that followed.

 While confirming the sentence by the trial court, the a high court said they deserve the punishment as it was a cold-blooded murder of a teacher in front of his students.

 This is the first award of the death sentence in the revenge killings between BJP and CPM cadres in north Kerala.

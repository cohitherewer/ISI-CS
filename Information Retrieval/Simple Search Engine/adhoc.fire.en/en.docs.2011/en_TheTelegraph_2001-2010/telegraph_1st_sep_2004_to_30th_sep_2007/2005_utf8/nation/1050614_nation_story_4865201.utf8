 Tibet on trade track

 - Govt keen to interact more with India, promote tourism

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Lhasa, June 13: Tibet is keen to follow the rest of China in opening up to the world. That could mean a new turn in Chinas relations with India, since all of the 3,500-km border between the two countries runs along the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR).

 The vice-chairman of TAR, Lhasong Gyaltsen, told a group of visiting Indian journalists here today that his government would like trade, tourism and other interactions with India and other South Asian countries to improve.

 Of the South Asian countries, Tibets largest border trade is with Nepal. TAR has 28 ports for border trade and most are on its border with Nepal.

 Lhasongs remarks are significant in the backdrop of the agreement between India and China to begin border trade across Nathu-la in Sikkim.

 The TAR governments keenness to look up new areas for border trade could offer new possibilities for Ladakh. Lhasongs statement comes within days of the Chinese vice-minister for foreign affairs, Wu Dawei, saying in Beijing that China could consider opening up more border points with India if the latter agreed.

 He also indicated that the TAR government was interested in opening up western Tibet to tourists from India. At present, only about 500 Indian tourists visit the pilgrimage route in the Kailash-Mansarovar area.

 I have to admit that the tourism infrastructure in those western regions is poor compared to that in Lhasa. Well like to improve the infrastructure in those areas. We welcome Indian tourists in Tibet and would work to create facilities for them, he said.

 Tibets proposals to open up more to Chinas South Asian neighbours could be an extension of the massive efforts being taken in TAR to improve and expand its road and railway network.

 The 1,100-km railway project connecting Lhasa to Qinghai, across high mountains and turbulent rivers, Lhasong said, would be completed in July next year.

 Work on four major highway projects will also be completed in the next two or three years, thereby expanding the road coverage in Tibet to 42,000 km in 33 counties.

 In reply to a question on the TAR governments position on the Dalai Lama issue, he reiterated the Chinese central governments argument that all aspects could be discussed if the Dalai Lama accepted that Tibet is an inalienable part of China and Taiwan a province of the country.

 He recalled that the Dalai Lamas representatives had visited TAR and had received a warm welcome. They had seen the economic construction, social progress and the unity of different ethnic groups in Tibet. But the future of the talks, he indicated, would depend on the Dalai Lama giving up his activities aimed at splitting the country.

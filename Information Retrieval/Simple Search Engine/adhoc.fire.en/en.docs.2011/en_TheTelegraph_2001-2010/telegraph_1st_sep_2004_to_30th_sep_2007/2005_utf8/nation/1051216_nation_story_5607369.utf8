 Boy not able to pay Rs 70 out of school

 RABI BANERJEE

 Humayun Sheikh: Victim of the system

 Krishnagar, Dec. 15: A boy from a below-poverty-line family was refused admission to Class VI of a government-aided school in Nadia because his parents could not pay Rs 70 as annual fees.

 While denying admission to Humayun Sheikh, the authorities of Nagadi High School also pointed out to his mother that he owed them a further Rs 70 as he had not paid the fees for Class V. 

 Since May, the 12-year-old had been pleading with the authorities for admission to Class VI, but headmaster Resoul Karim would not listen.

 Yesterday, Humayun approached Karim with his 50-year-old mother Maseema Bibi. She went to his office armed with the BPL card. But the reply was the same. 

 There are many children from below-poverty-line families and Humayun cannot be an exception, she was told.

 The mother and son then went to the Nakashipara block development officer, Mrinmoy Biswas. 

 I want to study, please help me, Humayun told him.

 Biswas began a probe and ordered the headmaster to allow the boy to sit in Class VI. 

 Krishnagar sub-divisional officer Ajay Sannamat today summoned the headmaster to his office and sought an explanation from him.

 The headmaster told me the school has about 250 below-poverty-line students. For them, teachers had raised funds from their own pockets. They dont want to give any more money now, Sannamat said.

 I told the headmaster that we would not tolerate it if a poor student drops out of school for only Rs 70, he added.

 Maseema, a resident of Soli village, about 130 km from Calcutta, has six sons, aged between 35 and 10. My eldest son Abdul Gani helps his father Asanulla in the fields. My second son has split with the family and works as a mason in Delhi. The next two study in classes X and VIII of Nagadi High School and also work in a tailoring shop part-time. Alamin is in Class V, she said.

 Asanulla, an agricultural labourer, had managed to pay his youngest sons fees. He earns Rs 25-30 a day, but even that is not regular. What the sons earn is a pittance.

 When we told Humayun that we cant provide Rs 70 for his admission, he was in tears, Maseema said, herself breaking down. 

 Humayuns brothers, who are also in his school, were too scared to raise the issue with teachers. The elder brothers provided the money from their own meagre earnings. 

 Sajjad Hussain Mallick, the teacher-in-charge, said there is no rule that allows admission without paying the annual fees. If the government frames a rule favouring poor students, we will not charge them a paisa.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has repeatedly expressed concern over school dropout rates in rural areas. He may not have taken into account how the system adds to that figure.

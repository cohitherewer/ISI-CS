 Taste of royalty, silver-plated

 Hyderabad, June 28: Next time you go to Hyderabad, dont be content with visiting one of the Nizams palaces for a peek at the royal way of living. Get a taste of that lifestyle for yourself at Shisha.

 The retro eatery at Amrutha Mall in downtown Somajiguda is the latest addition to the citys biryani-and-hookah joints.

 After you have passed through its 60 kg silver doors, the food will be served to you on silver plates from silver bowls. The spoons, forks, even the finger bowls are made of silver.

 The feel and touch of good cutlery enhances the flavour and taste of the food, says the owner, G. Sridhar. Only, we serve water in glasses to avoid smell.

 Spread over 5,000 square feet, the restaurant can serve 100 guests at a time with its 400 kg of silverware. It took us four months to design and make the 110 sets of cutlery, said a spokesman for Dhanlakshmi Jewellers of Delhi, who supplied the stuff.

 The touch of class has been enhanced by rich silk drapery bought from a Calcutta firm. The effort is to make everyone relax and feel like royalty, Sridhar says.

 The only thing we lack compared with a banquet at the Nizams palace are the punkha and the dancing girls, which we cannot provide now.

 The customers, though, can have an after-meal smoke free from a 15 kg silver hookah.

 The restaurant owners have taken some precautions. Special pillars with spy cameras embedded in them have been put up at critical points in the lounge to prevent theft.

 They are not meant for the customers at all, Sridhar hastens to clarify. Its the staff we are worried about.

 The bill for a group of four diners would be around Rs 2,500 for an average meal. Sridhar says customers dont mind paying for the ambience and the royal treatment. The tariff is on a par with that at some of the star hotels. Royalty doesnt come cheap, he says.

 Sridhar has plans to set up other outlets, too, which will mainly host festival-specific events. If someone wants to organise a vasantotsav, we shall provide the ambience. Same for Christmas parties, Udagi and Onam, he says. But that will come in phases.

 Only pigs amp; dogs left

 Port Blair, Jan. 6 (Reuters): It was once home to a venerated tribal people who were renowned carpenters, but today the island of Chawra is deserted, left only to howling pigs and dogs in the wake of last week?s tsunami.

 Most of the island?s 1,300 people survived but have been evacuated by a naval ship and are not sure if they will ever return to their ancestral homeland in the Andamans.

 ?We were terrified, everyone said the island was sinking,? said Reginald, who was helping his niece in the rescue ship?s sick bay after it anchored in Port Blair. ?I don?t know if I can go back ever.?

 Forty people were killed when giant waves lashed Chawra, 2.5 miles by 1.5 miles, on December 26. All survivors had to be evacuated to an emergency shelter on a larger island to prevent an outbreak of disease, said the captain of the ship involved in the rescue effort.

 Video images of the devastated Chawra island shot by the ship?s officers showed animal carcasses on a dirty beach, uprooted coconut trees and coffins from a flooded cemetery floating in the water.

 Bodies of victims were piled up in one corner of the island. The survivors, many half-clad, were huddled together in the middle on clumps of crushed trees, seeking shelter from rain and a roaring sea.

 The people of Chawra were traditionally looked up to by other Nicobarese and thought to have magical powers. They were known as excellent carpenters and artisans, famous for making good canoes and earthen pots.

 ?They were living next to corpses, they would have all fallen sick,? said Deepak Dhar, captain of INS Magar.

 Some of the survivors were so weak that sailors put them in gunny bags and lifted them over the gangway to the ship, he said.

 ?We had to leave the dogs and pigs behind, they were howling when we left,? Dhar said. ?Our first priority was human beings. The animals would have gotten sea sick and half of them would have died anyway.?

 One man, who had a parrot on his shoulder, was allowed on board with his companion.

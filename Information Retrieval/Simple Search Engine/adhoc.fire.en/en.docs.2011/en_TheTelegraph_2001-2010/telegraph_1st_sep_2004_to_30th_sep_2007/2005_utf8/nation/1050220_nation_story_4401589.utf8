 Cong in eleventh-hour campaign rethink

 K. SUBRAHMANYA 

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: The Congress? poll strategies in Bihar and Jharkhand have floundered. Egged on by its leaders in the two states, the party?s central leadership had reckoned it is not necessary to take its United Progressive Alliance partners along to wrest power in Jharkhand and improve its presence in the Bihar Assembly. 

 With just two days left before campaigning concludes for the final phase of polling, central leaders confess that the Congress and its UPA allies needed each other to stymie the BJP-Janata Dal (United) challenge. 

 ?Perhaps, we had entertained an exaggerated view of the party?s organisational strength in Bihar and underestimated the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s presence in Jharkhand. In both states, there is utter confusion now,? an AICC functionary said here. 

 Congress strategists had thought a UPA government in Bihar was certain after the elections due to a perceived despondency in the National Democratic Alliance camp. The party wanted to take advantage of the situation and carve out political space for itself, independent of Laloo Prasad Yadav. 

 The strategy has not only hurt the Congress? interests, but also seems to have hit its primary post-poll objective of installing a UPA ministry. 

 ?The best case projection of seats is 20 for our party in the 243-member Assembly. Probably we could have had a better chance of winning more than 20 seats even if we had contested just about 40 seats in alliance with the RJD,? a party leader in Bihar on poll duty said. 

 There is anxiety now about whether the UPA allies ? the RJD, Congress and Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party ? can come within sniffing distance of the majority mark and sew up a post-poll alliance. Party leaders say Laloo Prasad had told Sonia Gandhi a week ago: ?Our fight against each other is harming all of us.? 

 The realisation has prompted desperate measures. The Congress seems to have virtually abandoned the campaign of nearly two-thirds of its 33 candidates in the fray on February 23 to help Laloo Prasad improve the standing of his candidates in the battle against the NDA. 

 A campaign trip by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the state was cancelled today as a result.

 In Jharkhand, the Congress banked on the perceived anti-incumbency tilt against the NDA while assuming a comfortable win in Jharkhand. The RJD was dismissed as a fringe factor and not considered for the Congress-Jharkhand Mukti Morcha alliance. 

 Its calculations have gone haywire now, but the leadership believes the combine could just about touch the majority mark. Party leaders blame the poll managers for ?mishandling? the campaign. 

 ?In a state where Thakurs account for just 1.7 per cent of the population, how can be give 9 of the 37 nominations to candidates from that community?? one leader asked. Other sections supporting the party have felt alienated, they said. 

 The RJD, too, is not a marginal factor, they have found. Laloo Prasad has made things difficult for the JMM by backing rebel leader Stephen Marandi in half-a-dozen seats. As an eleventh-hour tactical move, the Congress might covertly do the same to weaken JMM chief Shibu Soren?s claim for chief ministership.

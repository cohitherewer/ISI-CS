 Punjab alert on pitches

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Mohali, Feb. 11: The Punjab Cricket Association has alerted the Board of Control for Cricket in India on possible attempts to damage wickets in other stadiums ? especially those hosting the forthcoming series with Pakistan ? after the raid on the Mohali stadium yesterday.

 ?After this attack and the police interrogation of the six Shiv Sena activists arrested yesterday, we have alerted the BCCI on similar attacks in stadiums in different parts of the country,? PCA chief I.S. Bindra said.

 Journalists were today taken to see the Mohali pitch and could spot no damage.

 BCCI president Ranbir Mahendra was yet to get in touch with the PCA over the incident. ?We sent a report on the matter to the BCCI president and secretary yesterday,? Bindra said.

 DIG (Ludhiana Range) Parag Jain, investigating the attack, warned those behind the conspiracy that they would be dealt with sternly. 

 Police would seek arrest warrants for the Shiv Sena?s northern India president Jai Bhagwan Goel, he said. 

 ?Those arrested have revealed that the conspiracy to damage the Mohali pitch was hatched by Goel at a meeting on February 1 in New Delhi.?

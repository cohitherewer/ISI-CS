 NHRC query on boy thrashing 

 New Delhi (PTI): The National Human Rights 

 Commission has sought a report from the Punjab government 

 on the alleged thrashing of a schoolboy by his teacher.

 Sahil Bansal, a Class-VI student of the Goniana government school in Bhatinda district, damaged his backbone after his Hindi teacher allegedly thrashed him for not sitting properly in class, a newspaper had reported on March 12.

 Sahil, thereafter, found it difficult to walk or sit, the report said.

 The commission directed that a copy of the report be sent to the principal secretary, education department, and asked the senior superintendent of police, Bhatinda, to look into the matter and submit their reports within two weeks.

 The newspaper, quoting the school principal, said no complaint had been lodged with him and the boy had only been chided and not beaten up.

 The teacher had denied the allegation, the report added.

 Examinee alleges negligence

 Ghaziabad (PTI): A Class-X student who 

 appeared for the Uttar Pradesh board examinations has complained

 his answer sheets.

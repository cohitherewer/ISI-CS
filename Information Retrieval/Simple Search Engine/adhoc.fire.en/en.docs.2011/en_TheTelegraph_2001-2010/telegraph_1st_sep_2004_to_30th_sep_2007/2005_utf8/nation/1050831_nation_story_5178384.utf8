 Reformer Sheila short-circuited

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Caving in to public pressure that was exploited by Congress dissidents, the Sheila Dikshit government in Delhi tonight resigned itself to an imminent rollback of a power tariff hike.

 The humiliating retreat under the nose of a central government that advocates power reforms will put Delhi in a populist club of states like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh which pay from its coffers to provide electricity at lower tariff.

 The Delhi government will have to pay the two power distribution companies ? one owned by Reliance and the other by the Tatas ? Rs 182 crore a year as subsidy to offset the concession to consumers. 

 This is the first rollback after Delhi opted to privatise power distribution in 2002.

 Dikshit, counted among performing chief ministers of the country, had staked her reform credentials on the power tariff hike, which she had defended.

 However, with public outrage mounting ? the campaign was led by non-political figures like actor Roshan Seth and management expert Shiv Khera ? the Congress high command took a back seat.

 The silence from 10 Janpath ? Dikshit is known for her good rapport with Sonia Gandhi ? spurred the chief ministers detractors in the party to hijack the issue. Led by state Congress president Ram Babu Sharma, party MLAs openly campaigned against the hike, saying the Opposition BJP would seize the issue otherwise.

 The Congress Legislature Party drove in the last nail tonight by passing a resolution that called for a complete rollback of the power tariff increase of 10 per cent for domestic consumers and 19.8 per cent for agriculture users. It was silent on the 5 per cent increase for industrial consumers.

 After the nearly three-hour legislature party meeting, embattled chief minister Dikshit said the resolution would be approved by the Delhi cabinet tomorrow.

 Citizens of Delhi were inconvenienced by the power tariff hike. A unanimous decision was taken at the CLP to roll back the hike in power charges for domestic and agricultural consumers, Dikshit, flanked by Sharma, said after the meeting.

 The resolution was clear. Complete rollback, she said. It will be moved before the cabinet tomorrow.

 The tariff hike had ignited a virtual civil disobedience movement in the capital with residents welfare associations hitting the streets and many refusing to pay the extra amount.

 During the day, the power companies had agreed to halve the hike but the Congress MLAs insisted on a full rollback.

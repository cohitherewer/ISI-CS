 SC puts green ruling on hold

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 11: The Supreme Court today stayed a March 2 order of the Union environment ministry closing down 218 industrial and mining units for violating green laws and operating without the no-objection certification (NOC) mandatory under the Environment Protection Act.

 The ministry?s order was issued following a February 21 directive of the apex court that such industries and mining units should be closed down as ?development could not be at the expense of environment?.

 The bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal, S.B. Sinha and P.P. Naolekar stayed the closure order after a large number of the units approached the court, blaming the environment ministry for sitting on their applications for NOC. They said closing down the units when the applications were pending would hurt them.

 In view of this submission, the bench stayed the March 2 order and asked the environment ministry to reply to the applications filed by the industrial units and posted the matter for further hearing after five weeks.

 The closure order had come on a petition by Goa Foundation, a social organisation, contending that hundreds of industrial and mining units were operating in the country without clearance from the environment and pollution control boards.

 Goa tops the list with 31 polluting units, followed by Rajasthan with 23 units. Bengal has only one unit ? Sonepur Bazari ?A? Opencast Project of M/s ECL ? according to the Centre?s affidavit filed in the court.

 The petitioner?s counsel, Raj Panjwani, said these units were continuing to defy various orders of the court on environment protection and pollution and did not bother to get the mandatory pollution clearance certificate under the Environment Protection Act. 

 Out of the 218 units, 70 are in the industry sector and 148 in the mining sector, the affidavit said.

 It named the major polluting states as: Goa (31), Rajasthan (23), Haryana (20), Maharashtra (20), Chhattisgarh (18), Madhya Pradesh (15), Orissa (7), Gujarat and Tamil Nadu (5 each), Andhra Pradesh (2) and Jharkhand and Bengal (1 each). 

 The industrial units were mainly engaged in the production of asbestos, bulk drugs, finished leather, pesticides, chemical dyes, electroplating, cement and alcohol.

 Advani admits riots blot

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: For the first time, BJP president L.K. Advani today admitted that the post-Godhra riots were a ?black spot? in the NDA?s copybook when it ruled at the Centre. 

 The former deputy Prime Minister, however, added that they did not have an impact on the NDA in the last parliamentary elections. 

 Addressing reporters after delivering the keynote address at a conclave organised by a weekly newsmagazine, the BJP president said: ?The events in Gujarat were a black spot for us in the sense that during the six-year rule of the Vajpayee government, the communal situation had been good.?

 However, he defended Narendra Modi, saying there is a mismatch between the ?reality? of his government and the ?image that has been created in the last few years?. Advani added that the Gujarat chief minister and the BJP would ensure that the state emerges in a ?different light?.

 He stressed that the government has acquitted itself politically and economically. ?The government is honest and corruption-free, which even the rivals agree upon,? he said, adding that the state is a popular destination for investors. 

 Muslims, too, are better off in Gujarat than in other states, the BJP leader said, as the per capita income of the community is higher there. 

 After Modi was cleared by Advani, Jawaharlal Nehru came in for unexpected praise. While the BJP has had a good word for most leaders involved in the Independence struggle, the party had reservations about Nehru and the ?dynastic rule? he allegedly perpetuated. However, today Advani praised the first Prime Minister as a ?true believer in democracy? who has ?erected strong edifices of democratic institutions that continue to serve us even today?. 

 Manmohan Singh, too, got a pat on his back. Speaking about the economic resurgence of India in the 1990s, Advani said: ?For effecting this radical, reform-oriented change in the direction and content of economic policy, I have no hesitation in giving credit to our present Prime Minister who was the finance minister then.? 

 Singing paeans to economic reforms, Advani said: ?When we look at the strengths of India?s economy today, it is self-evident that these could be acquired only because we took a fundamentally different path in the beginning of the 1990s. It was a path that turned away from the one that the Avadhi resolution (of 1955) had dictated for the previous four decades.? 

 He stressed that the NDA?s defeat in the last Lok Sabha elections was not a reflection on the economic policies pursued by the Vajpayee government. 

 ?Just because our performance in the economic field did not yield a renewed electoral mandate, it is tempting to conclude that reform-oriented economics is bad politics. That would not only be incorrect but highly injurious to India?s development in the future. If winning elections by hook or by crook were to become the sole criterion of good politics, those who have ruled Bihar for the past 15 years would qualify as its best practitioners,? Advani said.

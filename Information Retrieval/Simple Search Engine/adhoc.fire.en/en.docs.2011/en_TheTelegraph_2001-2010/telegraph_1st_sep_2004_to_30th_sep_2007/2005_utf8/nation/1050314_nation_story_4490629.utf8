 Neta blueprint for Bihar revival

 ASHISH SINHA

 Mishra: Advice time

 Patna, March 13: Leaders of various political parties have begun accepting that in the absence of any credible option, pressure should be built on Governor Buta Singh to bring about a positive change in Bihar when it is undergoing a spell of central rule.

 After Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan, who has described President?s rule as an opportunity to cleanse the state of the ?mess? it has been caught in, Janata Dal (United) leader Jagannath Mishra today spelt out the dos and don?ts for the governor.

 The former chief minister said while he did not favour central rule, the present situation should be utilised for setting the standards for whichever government comes to office after this spell.

 The governor, on his part, has also dropped enough hints that he means business and will make use of the opportunity. Singh has been conducting a series of meeting with officials, chalking out the course they should adopt to improve matters in the state.

 However, the delay in appointing advisers, besides effecting the much-expected administrative shuffle, has not gone down well with the political class. Mishra said no time should be lost and efficient, unbiased persons be appointed as the governor?s advisers.

 Government sources said the administrative shake-up might have to wait because the financial year was coming to a close. ?Every department has to wrap up its accounts and it will be convenient if a fresh beginning is made in the new financial year. Before that we have to get the state?s budget approved by Parliament,? an IAS officer said.

 ?The proposed budget outlay is being carefully worked out. The governor has already indicated that central funds should not be allowed to lapse. This would require a major change in the manners of the bureaucracy, which has so far remained subservient to a demanding political leadership,? he added.

 Mishra, once Singh?s colleague in the Union cabinet, said emphasis should be on the education system and administrative reforms. The governor?s stress is, however, on improving the law and order situation. The police headquarters has assured the governor on the recruitment of more than 10,000 personnel to fill up vacancies by mid-April.

 Sources said in appointing the governor?s advisers, the Union government has to make sure that neither Paswan nor Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav are rubbed the wrong way. ?Both of them are crucial for the continuance of the UPA government. The RJD has a good number of MPs while the LJP cannot be given a rough deal so that its proximity to the NDA grows,? the sources added.

 Paswan, however, continues to provoke the JD(U), which has 55 MLAs, to dump the BJP. He would then ?provide? the 67 legislators required to form an alternative government. 

 JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar said his 55 MLAs are ready and now Paswan should provide the proof of having the crucial 67 members with him, ?Take 55 and give 67. But where are these 67 going to come from?? he argued.

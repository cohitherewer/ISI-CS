 Bihar date mismatch

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The Centre may have dissolved the Bihar Assembly even before President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had approved the move, the Supreme Court was told today.

 Former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, appearing for a group of petitioners who have challenged the dissolution, told the five-judge constitution bench the case involved interesting questions of dates and times.

 For instance, governor Buta Singhs letter of May 21 to the President, buttressing his claim of large-scale horse-trading in the Bihar House, was attached with newspaper clippings dated May 22, Sorabjee said.

 He suggested the Centre notified dissolution of the House in anticipation that Kalam, then in Moscow, would sign on the dotted line. The Presidents signature was obtained later, Sorabjee claimed.

 The court has directed the Centre to file by tomorrow the exact times when (a) the governors report was received; (b) the President signed the notification and faxed it to New Delhi from Moscow; and (c) the House was dissolved.

 Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanian, appearing for the Centre, agreed to submit the details.

 The constitution bench must decide whether the dissolution was unconstitutional, if the governor should be summoned to answer questions on his personal and legal malafides, and whether the Bihar elections due next month should be stopped and the dissolved Assembly revived.

 The bench is hearing three petitions challenging the dissolution ? a public interest litigation by apex court advocate Viplav Sharma, a petition by four National Democratic Alliance MLAs of the dissolved House (represented by Sorabjee) and one by independent MLA Purnima Yadav.

 The arguments will continue tomorrow. After Sorabjee, Sharma will start his arguments, to be followed by counsel for Purnima Yadav. After this, the additional solicitor-general and the attorney-general will present the Centres case.

 Sorabjee has already argued that Buta Singh had recommended dissolution solely with the motive of preventing the National Democratic Alliance from forming a government, so that the Rashtriya Janata Dal stayed happy and kept backing the Congress-led government at the Centre.

 The five-judge bench said the verdict would be pronounced before the polls kick off on October 18. If the dissolution is declared invalid, the elections will be automatically annulled.

 VIP hub car fire

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: A car burst into flames in front of Ram Vilas Paswans home, a stones throw from Sonia Gandhis 10 Janpath, before the Prime Ministers cavalcade was to pass through the area this morning.

 Delhi police, which watch over 

 the Prime Ministers route, were thrown into a tizzy 

 when the white Ford Escort erupted into flames under a red 

 light near Paswans 12 Janpath house.

 The car was moving when it caught fire, scorching the paint and emitting flames that could be seen at a distance. It was later towed away. Deployed on the route to clear any obstruction to the Prime Ministers convoy, the police alerted the fire force. Two water tankers were rushed to the spot.

 The car was moving when it started burning and we could see the flames from here. But nothing really happened, said a constable. Delhi police officers, however, denied such an incident occurred on the Prime Ministers route.

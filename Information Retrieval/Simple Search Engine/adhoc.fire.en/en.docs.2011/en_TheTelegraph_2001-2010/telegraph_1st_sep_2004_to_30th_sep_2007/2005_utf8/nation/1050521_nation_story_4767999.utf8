 Sonia polishes Mufti crown

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 New Delhi, May 20: Sonia Gandhi is set to extend Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds term as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir by three years for the sake of national interest.

 Mufti is supposed to abdicate office on November 2 as part of a seat-sharing formula worked out in 2002 between the Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly that has a six-year term. 

 However, the Congress president is against a change of chief minister as this could affect the ongoing peace initiatives and the larger game plan that has been put in place to resolve the various dimensions of the Kashmir imbroglio, sources close to her said. 

 As the matter has both national and international ramifications, Sonia is treading cautiously. She is looking beyond party lines and is prepared to sacrifice the Congresss chance to lead the coalition, said a source.

 Sonia, who is also the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance, is satisfied with Muftis handling of Kashmirs affairs. 

 The Congress president has, in recent months, established contact with some top separatist leaders who are now veering round to joining the political process. 

 She feels that Muftis continuation could be crucial to the success of the move to persuade the separatist leaders to join the political process. 

 A retired IAS officer has been shuttling between Srinagar and New Delhi to keep Sonia informed on the developments.

 Opinion in the Congress is divided over whether or not to stake a claim in Jammu and Kashmir.

 Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was state Congress chief during the elections in the state, is lukewarm to the idea of returning to Srinagar. Azad holds the two ministerial posts of urban development and parliamentary affairs.

 The Congress leader has seldom worked in Kashmir except for a year as state party chief before the 2002 Assembly polls. His wife, Shamim, and other relatives are wary of him returning to the Valley.

 However, a section of powerful party leaders, such as general secretary Ambika Soni and M.L. Fotedar, are said to be favourably inclined to Azads return to state politics. 

 Azads departure from Delhi would create two berths in the Manmohan Singh government and also have an impact in intra-party affairs as he enjoys considerable influence in the partys organisational matters.

 Sonias move to grant another lease to Mufti will not go down well with party members in Jammu and Kashmir and allies like Bhim Singhs Panthers Party. 

 But the Congress president is not overly worried as these sections had tried to block Muftis crowning in 2002.

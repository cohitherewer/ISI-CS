 Rail official suspension revoked

 Allahabad, May 14 (PTI): The suspension of senior railway official A.K. Singh, which had prompted a flash strike by the staff at Allahabad junction, was revoked today.

 The suspension of the additional divisional railway manager was revoked this afternoon, the North Central Railway spokesman, R.K. Srivastava, said.

 Singh had been punished for ordering ticketless passengers travelling with a group of Bihar MPs off the Rajdhani Express on April 29. The passengers had beaten up railway staff who went to the AC first class compartment to check their tickets, prompting Singh to enter the coach and order them out.

 He was suspended yesterday on the charge of carrying out the inspection at a late hour.

 Supporters of Union minister Shakeel Ahmed of the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dals Raghunath Jha, Devendra Yadav and Magnilal Mandal were travelling with the MPs without tickets. Jha and Yadav allegedly threatened to have the official suspended.

 Soft drinks ban

 Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav has said that sale of soft drinks would be banned in trains and at stations and would be substituted by indigenous products like butter-milk. He, however, did not specify when the proposed ban would come into effect.

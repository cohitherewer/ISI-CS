 Attack on widow

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 1: A widow who managed to survive a decade-long boycott by the pro-CPM labour union in Kozhikode district is in hospital following an alleged attempt on her life.

 Vineeta Kottayi, who owns a five-acre plot, is scared to leave the hospital as she fears reprisals. The alleged assailant has been arrested but, so far, no word of condemnation has come from the Kerala State Karshaka Thozhilaly Union, which could not confirm whether the man was still its member.

 District secretary K.C. Nair said only the village committee had the membership details and the union would take its own time to verify if the assailant was a member.

 Vineeta said three persons broke into her house late on May 20 with a kerosene can. I ran out through the backdoor but the assailants closed in, splashed kerosene and lit a match stick. I remember collapsing at a neighbours, the former college lecturer added.

 The neighbours took her to the Medical College Hospital in Kozhikode.

 Vineetas troubles started in 1992 when she had to return to her ancestral house in the northern district after the death of her husband. Her father, a member of the undivided Communist Party, had expelled a woman worker, who was also a neighbour, for encroaching on his plot.

 Soon, the union intervened, treating it as a labour dispute and directing all labourers to keep off the farm until the woman was taken back. The embargo remained in force for nearly 11 years, driving the family to penury.

 The CPM, which virtually controls the area, turned a blind eye to Vineetas plight even as her crops perished and the farm remained fallow year after year. Vineetas son, who was beaten up publicly by party activists, developed mental problems.

 In June last year, the Janapaksham, a Kochi-based human rights organisation, took up the matter and came to Vineetas house with some workers to help her. However, the CPM leaders intervened and said the union would end the blockade on its own. 

 But that promise was not kept until an ultimatum was issued by the district administration.

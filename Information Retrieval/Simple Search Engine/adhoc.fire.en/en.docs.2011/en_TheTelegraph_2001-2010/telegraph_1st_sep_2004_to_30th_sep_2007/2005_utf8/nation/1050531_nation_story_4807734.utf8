 No deadline on Kashmir: PM

 New Delhi, May 30 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said it would be unrealistic to set a deadline for resolving the Kashmir issue but offered to work together with the Pakistan President to find a meaningful solution to difficult problems.

 In an hour-long interaction with foreign journalists based in Delhi, Singh said he looked forward to his visit to Pakistan. 

 I remain firm in my conviction that we must move towards finding constructive solutions to all outstanding issues, he said when asked if Pervez Musharrafs recent statements on greater autonomy, self-governance and international supervision for Jammu and Kashmir were realistic.

 The problem, he said, has defied a solution for the last 57 years and it will be unrealistic to fix any time frame for resolving it. I do not minimise the difficulties that lie ahead, he added, admitting that roadblocks could confront the two sides.

 Responding to questions on Indias relations with the US, China and neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, he said: I do believe that we have moved forward. We have today an atmosphere where we can start discussing basic problems.

 Singh asked Pakistan to honour its commitment to dismantle terrorist camps operating from its soil. If we have a major attack like the one on Parliament or the RSS headquarters or other places, that could upset the whole process, he said.

 The Prime Minister stressed that the first and foremost precondition he had conveyed to Musharraf was that terrorist elements must be fully under control.

 Although he said he was willing to discuss all issues, including what President Musharraf calls the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir, Singh firmly ruled out further division of the country or redrawing of boundaries.

 I will never accept anything that leads to further division of India on religious lines. I have no mandate to negotiate on redrawing our boundaries. Within these limitations, the two of us must work together to create an environment to take the peace process forward, he said.

 Centre gets rap on fast courts

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, March 30: The judiciary and the legislature appear to be on a collision course again, this time over fast-track courts that were set to wind up tomorrow after the Centre failed to grant funds for their continuation.

 The Supreme Court today took a grim view of non-allocation of funds to the 1,734 courts by the 12th Finance Commission while the Centre contended that there was no money.

 A division bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia today ordered that the courts should function beyond March 31 and ?at least? till April 30. 

 The bench indicated that it would be compelled to direct the continuation of the courts if the government did not allocate money even after April 30.

 When solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati argued that the matter be left to the government, the judges shot back. ?This court has been monitoring the functioning (of the fast-track courts) and the government has repeatedly assured that not only would the existing fast-track courts be continued for another five years, but efforts would be made to establish additional courts.

 ?Look at the chaos that would result from the winding up of these courts.? Cases (pending before them) have to be reheard... judges have to be readjusted and a long delay in the adjudication of the cases,? the court pointed out.

 Vahanvati said Union law minister H.R. Bharadwaj was personally in favour of continuance of the courts.

 The apex court today also issued notices to the Centre on a related petition by the Chennai-based All India Media Journalists Association seeking the extension of the fast-track courts beyond 2010. 

 The courts were established in 2001 to speed up criminal case trials. Over 2.5 crore cases were pending in criminal courts then. The fast-track courts were supposed to try cases on a day-to-day basis to reduce the burden on the regular courts. 

 However, no money was sanctioned after the initial release of Rs 509 crore by the 11th Finance Commission, with which the 1,734 courts were established.

 The courts are a ?dream come true? for those undertrials who suffer jail terms for years for petty offences. The case of Bengal?s Ajay Ghosh was an eye opener in this respect. He was the longest imprisoned undertrial in the history of independent India, having spent 37 years behind bar, from 1962 to 1999.

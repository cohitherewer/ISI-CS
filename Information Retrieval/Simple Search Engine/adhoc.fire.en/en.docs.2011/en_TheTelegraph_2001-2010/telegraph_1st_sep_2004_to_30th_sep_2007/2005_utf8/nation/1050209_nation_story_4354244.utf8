 Laloo tops minority poll plea charts

 - Backwards protest open ?appeal?

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Feb. 8: Muslim religious organisations have been openly appealing to voters to side with one party or the other with the common refrain of backing ?secular? forces in the state.

 So far, the appeals have been made in favour of the Rashtriya Janata Dal led by Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party. One little-known group has even sided with the Congress.

 The most overt appeal has come from the Imarat-e-Ahle Hadis, a grouping of the Wahabis, which has urged Muslims to back Laloo Prasad through prominent newspaper advertisements. The Emarat-e-Sharia, which represents the Deobandis, has also appealed on behalf of the RJD.

 The Adara-e-Sharia, headquartered at Sultanganj near Patna and a grouping of the Barelvis, has expressed itself in favour of Paswan. So has the Khankahi, which represents the Sufi line. Incidentally, the national body of Adara-e-Sharia has favoured Laloo Prasad.

 Even a group of Chistis from Ajmer has appealed to Muslims to vote for the RJD while Waris Ali Farooqui of the Deshbhushan Maulana Mazharul Haque Foundation has recounted the ?ills? of Laloo Prasad.

 Ali Anwar of the All-India Pasmanda Muslim Mahaj, an outfit of the depressed groups among the community, has vehemently protested the passing of ?fatwas? by religious bodies.

 ?It seems only an appeal from Mecca and Medina is now awaited. The religious bodies? sole duty is to ensure that the community?s affairs are carried out in accordance with the Shariat. They do not have a political role,? Anwar said. He has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission requesting it to bar open appeals by religious organisations.

 ?Such practices will only help promote communal divide. Can you justify Hindu religious organisations asking electors to back any particular party or candidate? The same standards should apply to all,? he added.

 The general assessment of Muslim voters undergoing a ?rethink?, a contention that has been played up by the media, seems to have led to such an open appeal, which is happening for the first time on such a scale. ?Laloo Prasad was not known to be resorting to such tactics. It looks like he is scared. But the RJD chief is playing a dangerous game for the limited objective of winning an election. The same is true of Paswan,? said a senior sociologist on condition of anonymity.

 ?It also seems that the customary emotive appeal has become weak among the backwards and depressed in the community. They now realise that the RJD rule has not benefited them economically and they have a good option in Paswan. This is the main reason why religious bodies have made an appeal on behalf of Laloo Prasad,? he added.

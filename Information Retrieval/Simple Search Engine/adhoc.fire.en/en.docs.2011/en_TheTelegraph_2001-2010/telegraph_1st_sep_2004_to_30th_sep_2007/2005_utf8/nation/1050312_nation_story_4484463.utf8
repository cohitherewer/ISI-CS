 Buta hope in crime fight

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, March 11: The ransom cloud looms over doctors yet again, but there is a silver lining as well.

 Orthopaedic surgeon R.C. Ram and his son Anil Kumar allegedly received three ransom calls for Rs 50 lakh on the evening of March 8. The caller, Sonu, claimed to be the nephew of jailed criminal Bindu Singh.

 But, unlike the pre-poll scenario, when criminals held society to ransom, there is hope this time. The reason: Governor Buta Singh?s tough talk on law and order.

 Extortion and abduction are nothing new for Ram, the first doctor to be abducted in the capital in 1992. The incident was arguably the first major crime in Laloo Prasad Yadav?s regime. Now, after the ouster of the Rabri Devi government, the same doctor is in the limelight once again.

 In the past few years, about half-a-dozen doctors have been killed and more than 35 abducted, not to mention the scores who have received extortion threats for ransom running into lakhs. The murder of surgeon N.K. Agrawal in November last year is still fresh in the minds of the people of the city and elsewhere in the state.

 The list is just a drop in the ocean of crime in the 15 years of Rashtriya Janata Dal rule. Over 19 lakh cases have been registered, with around 40,000 abductions, a report released by former chief minister Jagannath Mishra on January 28 revealed.

 Ram, the seniormost orthopaedic surgeon in the capital, has got special police security after last Tuesday?s phone calls. Police have lodged a case and are on the lookout for the culprits.

 The state unit of the Indian Medical Association has taken up the issue and written to the authorities, including the governor. The association had almost paralysed the medical system in the first half of January when Madhepura-based doctor, U.K. Raja, was abducted on New Year?s Day. The doctor was released after police mounted pressure on the kidnappers.

 Manoj Singh, a supplier of surgical instruments and resident of Nandpuri under Shastri Nagar police station, got a taste of crime on Wednesday night. About six armed criminals allegedly looted cash, gold ornaments and other valuables worth Rs 2 lakh from Singh?s house, the police said.

 In another case of suspected abduction, 12-year-old Satyam, a student of DAV Public School, is missing from Wednesday evening. Satyam?s father Ramanuj Kumar has lodged a case with Kankarbag police.

 Free money transfer for UK Indians

 AMIT ROY

 London, April 16: Britain?s 1.2 million people of Indian origin are to be offered free money transfers between the UK and India as well as rupee mortgages under a new partnership agreement between Lloyds TSB and ICICI Bank.

 Sonjoy Chatterjee, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank in London, said: ?The India Banking Service is a real landmark for the Indian community in Britain and for financial services in general.?

 Lloyds TSB, which is one of Britain?s biggest banks, was so impressed with the number of new accounts opened during a pilot project carried out in Wembley, an area of London with a large Gujarati population, that it is extending the scheme to 40 of its branches throughout the UK.

 ?We intend to extend it to all our branches and we have 2,000 of them throughout the country,? Emile Abu-Shakra, spokesman for Lloyds TSB, told The Telegraph.

 There will be no minimum sum required by an Indian customer to open a Lloyds TSB account, he said. Once the customer had done that, Lloyds TSB would do the paperwork necessary to open a corresponding account with ICICI Bank in India, where India?s fastest growing private bank has 560 branches at the moment.

 Transferring money from the UK to India would then be free and take three working days.

 As to what is an Indian, the definition is to be interpreted fairly liberally.

 ?This is meant for NRIs, anyone who can prove they are Indian within six generations,? said Abu-Shakra.

 In past years, relatives of Indians settled in the UK have been given the round around by bank employees in India who have taken up to six weeks to pay up. This situation is now improved though banks in the UK still charge a high premium on transfers. This bites into small sums which are sent as gifts for birthdays, weddings and medical expenses.

 Lloyds TSB, which has clearly been studying the Asian market in Britain, has already introduced free Islamic banking and mortgages for Muslims in the UK. 

 The 1.2 million people of Indian origin in the UK offer a tempting target because they include the affluent and dynamic Gujarati and Punjabi business communities. But there are also many Bengali and South Indian professionals in medicine, science and in the universities. The UK has hundreds of Indian millionaires.

 Lloyds TSB says ?the service is the first of its kind to be offered by a high street branch and aims to provide a one-stop shop to help the country?s Indian population manage their finances and property purchases. Many Indians living in the UK still have property and financial commitments in India.?

 Gordon Rankin, director of Lloyds TSB Community Financial Services, said: ?More than one million Indians now live and work in the UK and this number is now on the rise. But the community?s links with India remain strong and many British Indians have businesses, properties and families back home which they continue to finance. 

 ?The India Banking Service is designed with the needs of this community in mind and should help a large and vital part of the population get the most out of their money.?

 Describing how mortgages would work, Chatterjee said: ?Supposing you wanted to buy a flat in Calcutta in Ballygunge, we would provide the rupee mortgage in India. For Rs 30 lakh you could get something decent in Calcutta. It would be more in Mumbai. Supposing you have no idea where you want, we have a property division which would come up with a shortlist for you.?

 The mortgage would be paid back in the UK in pounds. The interest rate would be Indian, ?currently between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent?.

 If the marriage between Lloyds TSB and ICICI works, it is likely other banks will also introduce similar schemes.

 ?There is nothing like this at the moment,? Chatterjee pointed out. ?We are the biggest private bank in India and Lloyds TSB is a ?600-billion bank.?

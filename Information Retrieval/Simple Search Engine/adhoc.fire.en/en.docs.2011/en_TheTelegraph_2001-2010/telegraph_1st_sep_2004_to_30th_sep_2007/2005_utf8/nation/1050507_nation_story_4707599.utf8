 Nepal arms block stays

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, May 6: India is not likely to resume arms supply to Nepal in a hurry. 

 It has, instead, decided to keep up diplomatic pressure on King Gyanendra to ensure that he takes concrete steps and not ?cosmetic ones? to restore democracy in his country.

 South Block appears to have taken this stand after the Indian leadership had a series of meetings with its ambassador to Nepal Shiv Shankar Mukherjee over the past few days. 

 Mukherjee arrived here on Tuesday ?for consultations? on developments in Nepal in the wake of Gyanendras decision to end the three-month emergency.

 The envoy met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, home minister Shivraj Patil and foreign secretary Shyam Saran.

 The determination of Nepals democratic forces to launch a movement against Gyanendra has encouraged the Indian leadership to keep up the heat on the king.

 Kathmandus political parties have prepared a tentative roadmap, the draft of which is now being passed around, to agree on a programme that will force the king to restore democracy.

 There are indications that once the draft is agreed on, leaders of parties, including the Nepal Congress, the United Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and the Sadbhawana Party, will jointly meet the king. They will demand the immediate reinstatement of Parliament and setting up of a national government that will take urgent steps to deal with Maoist rebels.

 In the past few weeks, conflicting signals have been emanating from Delhi on its policy towards Nepal. It began with Gyanendras public statement that India has promised to resume arms supply to his government after he held back-to-back meetings with the Prime Minister and the foreign minister in Jakarta.

 Delhi tried to do some damage control with the Prime Minister clarifying that a decision would be taken keeping the ?entire perspective? in mind. 

 Some Indian leaders informally said the first consignment of arms would be on its way ?within the next 10 days?.

 The Left, on the other hand, was firm that Delhi should not do anything to bail out the king till he makes a serious attempt to restore democracy 

 After discussions with the ambassador, it has now been decided that arms will not go to Kathmandu unless Gyanendra moves towards the road to democracy ? he should release all politicians and their supporters, ensure free access to human rights activists and do away with the ban on the media. 

 Apart from lifting emergency, Gyanendra has not done much else. Though he released some leaders, he arrested a few more immediately afterwards. This is being seen in South Block as a clear signal from the monarch that if democracy is to be brought back, it would have to be on his terms.

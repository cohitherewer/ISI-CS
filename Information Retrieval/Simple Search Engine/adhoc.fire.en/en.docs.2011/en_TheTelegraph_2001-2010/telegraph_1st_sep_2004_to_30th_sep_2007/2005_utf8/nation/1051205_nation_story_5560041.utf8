 US frees Indian from Iraq custody

 JOHN MARY

 New Delhi, Dec. 4: An Indian youth who was in the custody of US-led forces in Iraq for four months was released today, official sources said.

 Sijo Jose, hailing from Kottayam in Kerala and working in a Kuwaiti catering firm that supplied food to US soldiers, was arrested on charges of entering a prohibited area and taking photographs without permission.

 Today, his family in Kerala heaved a sigh of relief on hearing his voice again on the phone.

 An official at the Indian embassy in Iraq, John Abraham, rang up Sijos home around 7 pm to convey the news. Sijo then spoke to his family.

 My son was sobbing, trying to console us and telling us not to cry or else hed lose control, mother Marykutty said. 

 Sijo told her that the embassy had assured him about his return within two to three days. The ticket was being booked for Nedumbassery airport.

 The US army had picked up Sijo in the northern town of Mosul in Iraq on August 1 for carrying a digital memory stick in his pocket, allegedly containing snaps of prohibited areas.

 Marykutty said her son called twice between 7 and 8 pm today but did not want to discuss his time in captivity in the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. Ill tell you everything after I reach home, he told Marykutty.

 Sijos father K.P. Jose broke down on hearing his sons voice. Elder brother Sojan, a rickshaw driver, said he did not want to embarrass his brother by asking questions about his detention.

 The family had learnt about Sijos detention on August 22 from his mates ? Manoj and Santhosh ? in Iraq. 

 Weve been praying and pleading with politicians to get our son back home ever since we got news of the detention. I got a call from E. Ahmed (minister of state for external affairs) last Friday, assuring me that release was at hand, said Marykutty.

 The family was initially in the dark about the governments efforts to release Sijo, but it was the tragic killing of Indian Border Roads Organisation driver R. Maniappan in Afghanistan that shocked the Centre into action on getting the Keralite youth released.

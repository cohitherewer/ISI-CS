 Second thoughts on chopper deal

 Ranchi, Nov. 27: The Jharkhand government is having second thoughts on procuring two Dhruv helicopters from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) following the crash-landing of a Jharkhand-bound chopper in Andhra Pradesh on Friday. 

 Sources said the civil aviation department is thinking of cancelling the contract with HAL since the showpiece helicopters are crash-landing regularly because of a technical defect. Also, the Bangalore-based public sector company has defaulted in delivering the flying machines on time. 

 The state government wants to use the helicopters in its anti-extremist operations and has laid down specifications similar to those found in military-configured aircraft.

 HAL was to deliver the two helicopters, each costing Rs 33 crore, by March 2005, and Fridays mishap was the second time in two weeks that the Dhruv crash-landed while being flown to Ranchi. On November 11, the same chopper had developed a technical snag during a flight to the Jharkhand capital.

 There are serious doubts about the tail rotor ? which helps in direction control ? of the comparatively new Dhruv as one helicopter had crash-landed due to the same problem near Delhi sometime ago. Another had to force land from a height of about 40 feet while flying to Nepal, sources said.

 The civil aviation department, which has placed a proposal for cancellation of the contract before chief secretary P.P. Sharma, has begun collecting relative prices of helicopters from across the world. The heavy 5.5-tonne class Dhruv has no resale value and the government, which has paid an advance of Rs 14 crore, can back out at this stage while charging penalty from HAL for the delay. 

 Sources said HAL has not worked on the police version of the helicopter as it had claimed earlier. What Jharkhand is being given is the civil version and equipment like forward-looking infra-red cameras etc, will take at least a year, said an official.

 Civil aviation secretary Sajal Chakravarti said his department was not interested in a stop-gap arrangement. 

 We wanted the company to deliver the brand new Dhruv because we did not want to endanger the lives of our people. But the company insisted on sending an old helicopter until the new one was ready. We have been monitoring the old Dhruv and know it has some major problem in the tail rotor, he said.

 HAL executive president K.K. Gupta said he had no idea about Jharkhand having second thoughts on the Dhruv purchase. It is the Jharkhand governments decision to continue with the contract with us or cancel it, he said.

 Worried as the walls close in

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Nov. 11: Abu Salems face had none of that hunted look of his old pictures when he was produced in court today.

 But his body language on the flight and after we landed was that of a worried man trying to pose as a stoic, a Mumbai police officer said.

 Monica was a complete contrast. She looked fresh and radiant and didnt even glance at him once while they were being put into separate vehicles. He, however, kept looking wistfully at her.

 A hard-boiled criminal feeling abandoned as he sees the walls close in on him? The Azamgarh boy-turned-Bollywood terrors story almost comes with a moral at the end.

 Salem was born Abdul Qayoom Ansari in Sarai Mir the year Mario Puzo published The Godfather. But life in a small town in eastern Uttar Pradesh was not for him.

 Delhi ? the nearest metro ? was the obvious first destination where he worked as a driver. But Mumbai, the city of dreams, beckoned.

 A cousin in Andheri coached him in small-time extortions in Andheri. But love got him into trouble with police. Salem had married a college student against her familys wishes and they filed a case of abduction against him. To avoid questioning, Salem moved to Santa Cruz and set up a PCO.

 Here, he got to know J.K. Ibrahim, a Dawood henchman, who introduced him to the dons brother, Anees. It was the big chance he had been waiting for. Owner of a voice that invoked fear, Salem was handpicked by Dawood to terrorise Bollywood, to make those notorious phone threats. The flashy life, the cash, the feeling of power ? life was suddenly a dream for the 54 Azamgarh boy.

 As extortion became the D-companys cash cow, Salems career zoomed. Bollywood whetted his appetite for pretty women, and dalliances with starlets followed.

 After the Bombay blasts, Salem followed his boss to Dubai and opened a front business of organising stage shows with Bollywood artistes. The threats from The Voice got the stars scampering to Dubai.

 At one such show, Salem met Monica, then a starlet. Who used whom is unclear, but she became Salems pointperson in Bollywood, ensuring a career rise for herself while helping him continue his reign of terror.

 It was the sensational murder of Gulshan Kumar in 1997 that made Salem famous through the underworld. It also set up his downfall.

 Dawood, apparently unaware of the operation, was offended. Soon, Salem had a showdown with the bosss right-hand man, Chhota Shakeel. Fearing he would be bumped off, Salem fled Dubai.

 After two years on the run, he entered Portugal with fake papers. He and Monica were arrested in September 2002. During the lengthy diplomatic negotiations for their extradition, Monica began detaching herself from him.

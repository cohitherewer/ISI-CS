 Land for poor in hands of rich

Hyderabad, Aug. 26: The Andhra Pradesh governments much-touted land-for-landless programme may soon have to bite the dust.

 Certified as a BPL (below poverty line) woman, a tribal who collected land documents from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday is now found to be rolling in riches.

 Komili Bai, who lives in Bytol, a hamlet in Medak district, got five acres from Singh after getting a BPL stamp from revenue officials. 

 But Komili is, perhaps, one of the richest tribals in the area. Her husband Wyachu owns a tractor and an eight-room bungalow in the hamlet, around 30 km from the district town of Medak. 

 Following an expose in local dailies, the district collector ordered an inquiry, which took the lid off the revenue officials lapse. The probe also revealed that five acres of land and a concrete house were registered in Komilis name.

 Piqued by the media reports, the offices of the chief minister and the Prime Minister have directed district officials to probe the matter and send them a report within a week.

 Revenue official P. Ramakrishna Reddy, however, washed his hands of the row. We included Komili Bais name as per the recommendation of the local Congress legislator, Shashidhar Reddy, he said.

 The storm was further stoked by the Telengana Rashtra Samiti. Komili Bais husband owns about 50 acres of land, said TRS leader Indrakaran Reddy. 

 Of the 23,584 acres of land distributed in the district, nearly 5,000 acres were given to undeserving and non-BPL candidates, he alleged. 

 Revenue officials, however, blame it on the government policy of registering the land in the name of women. The Telugu Desam Party echoed them. Landlords take advantage of the condition and acquire plots in the names of their wives and daughters, said S. Venugopalachari, a former Desam minister from Adilabad.

 Defending the government policy, state revenue minister D. Prasad Rao said: We only aimed to empower women with the right to own land.... 

 Controversy began courting the project right from the first phase, when 1.56 lakh acres were distributed by the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government on January 26. 

 What the Congress claimed as distributed were the lands already in possession of farmers belonging to the Left parties, said CPI legislator Chada Venkat Reddy.

 The Desam, too, has come down heavily on the programme, saying it is an exercise to benefit only Congress workers. Over 40 per cent of the beneficiaries are from well-to-do families, whose women did not have land, said its spokesperson T. Devender Gowd.

 The Congress faced more flak in Krishna district. Ministers J.C. Diwakar Reddy and P. Venkateswar Rao were ghearoed by Desam workers ? when they went to Gudivada town to distribute land ? who alleged that plots were being snatched from poor farmers and given to the landless.

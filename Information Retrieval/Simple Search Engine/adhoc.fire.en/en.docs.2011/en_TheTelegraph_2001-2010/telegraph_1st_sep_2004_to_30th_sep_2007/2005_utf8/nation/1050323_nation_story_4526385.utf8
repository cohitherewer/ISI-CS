 Met model set for makeover 

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, March 22: India?s ambiguous weather management system will soon make way for a well thought-out model aimed at minimising damage to the monsoon-dependent economy and loss of life over the long term.

 The new model, which looks to making accurate forecasts and prediction of natural disasters, is being drafted by the Prime Minister?s Science Advisory Council. It will address long-term concerns on truant monsoons and recurring floods and drought.

 ?Our plan is getting ready but it will not be a voluminous document. It will be a succinct, long-term approach on Met science. We will have an overall view and will not merely deal with the disaster aspect, though we have lots of problems that are set off by one or two calamities every year,? said Prof C.N.R. Rao, the chairman of the advisory council.

 A member of the advisory council said the plan envisages a multi-pronged strategy on weather management. 

 To start with, a network of experts in atmospheric sciences and meteorology and the secretaries of the departments of space, science and technology, ocean development and agriculture would pool in data on weather conditions and pass them on to the state governments.

 At regular intervals, these experts would despatch Met updates to the district administration in regions prone to floods and those along the coasts. 

 In addition, the Centre would support research in earth sciences in well-known research and development institutes and universities to upgrade the limited manpower and data in these fields.

 At present, weather management is done separately by various departments without any real co-ordination between them. The Met department does its own job as does the ocean and the agriculture departments but they do not co-ordinate or exchange data.

 The gross lack of co-ordination was exposed during the tsunami false alarm ? soon after the big one on December 26 ? set off by a fax sent by the Met department to the ocean ministry without any corresponding intimation to state governments or coastal areas.

 The initiative would facilitate collaboration with global research groups working on weather models of the Indian Ocean and seas around India, the council member said.

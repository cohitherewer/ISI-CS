 Widow wins poll battle

 BOBBY MOHANTY

 Rourkela, April 24: The Biju Janata Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party combine today retained the Sundargarh constituency after BJP candidate Sushma Patel defeated her Congress rival Kishore Chandra Patel by a margin of about 8,900 votes in the byelection.

 A turnout of 68.2 per cent was recorded on April 21, the polling day.

 The BJP candidate polled 53,641 votes against 44,596 of Patel. Orissa Gana Parishad candidate Gopal Chandra Pradhan, who was backed by the CPI and CPM, came third, polling only 3,885 votes.

 Bypoll to the Assembly constituency was necessitated following the death of BJP legislator and the government?s deputy chief whip, Shankarsan Nayak, in a road accident in January this year. 

 Counting started at 8 this morning and the Congress candidate, a former minister, was leading after the first two rounds. But Sushma soon overcame the deficit and won the seat comfortably at the end.

 Expressing satisfaction, Sushma said, ?This (the victory) confirms that the Opposition?s move to tarnish the image of the ruling combine has fallen flat. The people of Sundargarh have been able to see through its efforts.?

 Sushma was expected to gain from a sympathy wave, as she is the widow of Nayak.

 Gohar slur

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Aug. 6: Former Pakistan foreign minister Gohar Ayub Khan today churned the 1965 war cauldron again, reiterating that an Indian Army brigadier had sold secret war plans to his father for Rs 20,000.

 Waving away Pranab Mukherjees dismissal of his claim, he said in a statement: The Indian government has failed to trace out the officer who held a very senior position in the army before retirement.

 The Indian defence minister had last week told Parliament that the Centre had probed Khans allegation and found them baseless.

 Khan, whose autobiography is scheduled to hit the bookstands in December, had in end-May dropped the bombshell that Pakistan military ruler Ayub Khan bought the secret plans from an Indian brigadier.

 Defence minister Mukherjee had to whitewash the issue? by stating on the floor of the Rajya Sabha that my claim was an attempt to sensationalise events to promote the sale of my book due to be released in December, Khan said.

 Although analysts feel Khan made the statement to pitchfork his book into the bestseller category, he insisted the Indian Army was clueless about the brigadier who served the military operations directorate in 1965.

 Khan, however, declined to reveal the brigadiers identity saying the time was not ripe yet.

 Some retired Pakistan Army generals, including former army chief General Mirza Aslam Beg, and former ISI chief Lt Gen. Hameed Gul have ridiculed Khans claim.

 No such plan exists even in our military archives, Beg said, adding that it was inconceivable such an important document would be sold for a paltry Rs 20,000.

 Had Pakistan indeed secured any Indian secret plan, the 1965 war scenario would have been altogether different, he said. 

 General Gul said Khans claim exposed his lack of knowledge of military matters.

 Khan was an aide-de-camp in the army but sought retirement when he was just captain.

 Focus on ?tainted? MPs

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 30: Hans 

 Raj Bhardwaj today said he would submit a comprehensive 

 note on honesty in public life to Manmohan Singh.

 ?The Prime Minister has asked me to prepare a comprehensive note on probity in public life. I am studying various materials on the subject and I will submit it to him soon,? the Union law minister told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.

 The move assumes significance in the wake of the Opposition?s demand for the dismissal of railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, against whom a chargesheet has been filed in a fodder scam case.

 The law minister, however, hastened to add that the ?(Atal Bihari) Vajpayee government, too, had tainted ministers?. There should not be any ?double standards on the issue?, he asserted.

 ?We give great importance to probity in public life. We cannot accept double standards. This problem is not only in India but also in many developed countries like, say, for example, Britain?. There should be a debate on the issue,? Bhardwaj said.

 Asked if the government favoured a law on the subject, the minister said if a ?consensus? was reached after the debate, ?we will change the law?.

 The law minister rejected the demand for Laloo Prasad?s dismissal.

 Low-key Indian presence at funeral

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The Centre has sent P.M. Sayeed, a lightweight among its cabinet ministers, to represent India at King Fahds funeral in Riyadh today, despite its strong ties with Saudi Arabia.

 Sources said President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat were reluctant to lead the Indian delegation.

 The decision to send Sayeed could raise a few eyebrows as many countries have been represented by their most important leaders ? in some cases the heads of government.

 The foreign ministry, in a statement this evening, said: In the passing away of His Majesty King Fahd, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia has lost a leader and the world an elder statesman.

 India has declared today as a day of mourning and flew its flag half-mast. President Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have already sent their condolences to King Abdullah, the departed leaders successor.

 Shekhawat, who headed the Indian delegation to the Popes funeral, was reluctant to go on such occasions, according to sources. It is not known why Kalam did not go.

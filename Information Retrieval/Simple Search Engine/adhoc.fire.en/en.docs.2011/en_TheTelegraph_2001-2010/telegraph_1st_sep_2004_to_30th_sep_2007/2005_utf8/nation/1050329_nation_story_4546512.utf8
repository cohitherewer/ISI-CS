 Natwar nuclear high ground 

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, March 28: Making a renewed bid to be recognised as a responsible nuclear-weapon state, India today said its ?conduct has been consistent? with key provisions of the non-proliferation treaty as ?they apply to nuclear-weapon states? although the country is not a signatory to it. 

 Showing clear signs of flexibility, external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh said if the key world powers were willing to help India in nuclear civilian energy, it was willing to open every such cooperation project to ?international safeguards? scrutiny.

 The non-proliferation treaty makes it clear that barring the five declared nuclear-weapon states ? the US, the UK, France, Russia and China ? others will have to open all their nuclear facilities to international inspection if they want outside help for nuclear civilian programmes.

 India refuses to accept this. Delhi maintains that while Indian nuclear military facilities ? developed indigenously ? will not be open to inspection, it was willing to accept scrutiny by the International Atomic Energy Agency of its civilian nuclear projects that have been developed with outside help. 

 Singh?s remark is being seen as an attempt to outline Delhi?s stand with an eye on the review conference of the NPT in Geneva in May. His comments are also significant against the backdrop of the recent signals from the US on access to India to nuclear technology.

 ?The non-proliferation order is coming under increasing stress, both on account of failure to make any significant progress towards nuclear disarmament as well as the failure to prevent clandestine proliferation by members of the NPT as well as some who are outside it,? Singh told a conference on emerging nuclear proliferation challenges.

 ?Article I of the NPT obliges a nuclear-weapon state not to transfer nuclear weapons to any other country or to assist any other country to acquire them. India?s record in this regard is impeccable?.,? he said.

 Although he did not mention Pakistan, Singh did not miss the opportunity to draw a distinction between the nuclear twins. India?s impeccable credentials were ?in contrast to the poor record of some of the nuclear-weapon states? that have been either active collaborators to illegal proliferation, including sale of nuclear components and technology.

 The father of the Pakistan nuclear bomb, Abdul Qadir Khan, had recently been linked to nuclear sales to Iran.

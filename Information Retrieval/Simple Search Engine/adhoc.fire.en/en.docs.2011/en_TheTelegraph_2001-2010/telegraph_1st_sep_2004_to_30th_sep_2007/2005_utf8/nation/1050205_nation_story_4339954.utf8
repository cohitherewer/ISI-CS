 Anthem ruling

 Indore, Feb. 4 (PTI): A court here has ruled that not standing at attention while the national anthem is played is not prima facie a crime.

 ?It is the moral duty of a person to stand in the attention position when the national anthem is played but if they do not do so, then, prima facie it is not a crime under the 1971 act (Prevention of Insult to National Honour Act), and, under the 2002 National Flag Code, no mention of any crime is stated if a person is not standing at attention,? judicial magistrate Narendra Jain said.

 The ruling came on a petition filed against railway minister Laloo Prasad and Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi for remaining seated while the national anthem was being played at a function.

 ?The court has not found prima facie any evidence to act against the couple under these two acts, and therefore, it is dismissing the complaint,? the magistrate said.

 The petition was filed on the basis of a photograph, published by a newspaper here

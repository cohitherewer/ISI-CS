 Boss fails to mend Sena crack

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 15: Shiv Sena rebel Raj Thackeray today relented and met uncle Bal Thackeray but failed to sort out matters, deepening the crisis in the 39-year-old party.

 Raj drove to the Sena chiefs bungalow, Matoshree, in Uddhavs absence this afternoon, briefly raising hopes of a settlement of the power struggle between the warring cousins. He was accompanied by senior leader Manohar Joshi, chief negotiator between the party and the dissident.

 As he came out of the house after 20 minutes of talks, Raj refused to speak to the waiting media teams.

 An indication that the talks had failed came at Krishna Kunj, Rajs house at Shivaji Park where Bal Thackeray was ferried in a boat when Matoshree was flooded during the July 26 deluge. 

 There is no change in my stance, Raj told reporters.

 Party sources, however, did not rule out more attempts at negotiations with the rebel leader, who shares with the senior Thackeray his love of Right-wing political rhetoric and the art of cartooning.

 On November 27, exactly a week after the Sena suffered a crushing defeat under Uddhavs leadership in the Malvan Assembly bypoll, Raj had resigned as a Sena leader and also as chief of its student wing.

 Rajs rebellion was prompted by the feeling of being consistently sidelined by Uddhav, anointed Sena executive president by Thackeray senior in 2003, in the partys daily functioning and electoral strategies.

 Minutes after his resignation, which led to Raj supporters attacking Uddhav loyalists, the nephew publicly declared that the Sena was being run by a coterie of clerks who do not understand politics.

 The Sena leadership made several attempts to persuade Raj to return to the party fold. Uddhav claimed his father had sent across at least four invitations for talks at Matoshree, but the nephew had not yielded.

 Raj had instead driven to Pune and remained steadfastly silent on his plans.

 His followers announced he would float a non-political organisation that would revert to the partys original sons-of-the-soil ideology of protecting Maharashtrians interests and pandering to their cultural pride. It would then slowly shape up into a political party.

 Raj, however, remained silent, letting the Sena reopen negotiations under Manohar Joshis leadership and eventually persuade him to visit Matoshree.

 The cousins differences began showing after the Sena supremo chose his son to lead the party instead of his more popular nephew during the outfits first-ever internal election in 2003.

 In July this year, shortly after Narayan Rane was expelled, Bal Thackeray had mediated between Raj and Uddhav and promised that the nephew would get equal prominence in party affairs.

 But during the crucial Malvan bypolls, Uddhav decided the campaign while Raj was allowed to address just a lone public meeting.

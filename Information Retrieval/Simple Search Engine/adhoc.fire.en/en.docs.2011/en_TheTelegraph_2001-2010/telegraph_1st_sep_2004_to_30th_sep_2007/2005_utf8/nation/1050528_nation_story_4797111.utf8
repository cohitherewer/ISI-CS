Bhubaneswar, May 27: Buckling under pressure from academics and party colleagues, Orissa higher education minister Sameer Dey today rolled back his decision to scrap Oriya from the curriculum of 140 colleges across the state.

 Apart from Oriya, Deys department had removed political science, mathematics, economics, philosophy, psychology, home science, statistics, social science, anthropology, Bengali, Hindi and Urdu from degree courses in both government and private colleges early this week, saying there are few takers for these subjects.

 The decision to abolish Oriya invited howls of protest from several quarters, including law minister Biswabhusan Harichandan, prompting chief minister Naveen Patnaik to call on Dey in his office this afternoon. He advised the minister to withdraw the decision.

 However, the decision on scrapping the other subjects will remain unchanged.

 Yesterday, Harichandan had drawn Patnaiks attention to the move. Its too important a subject to be decided alone by a department. The cabinet alone can take a decision on the issue, he said.

 Dey had called a news conference this morning to explain his stand. However, the move boomeranged with the meet turning violent after members of the Kalinga Sena started shouting slogans against the minister. The conference had to be called off.

 But Dey insisted that his department had never wanted to hurt the sentiments of the people. Its an unseemly controversy. We wanted to give quality education, but have limited resources. But we had to withdraw the decision as it hurt the sentiments of the people. 

 He said his department would launch a drive to encourage students to take up Oriya as a subject. After all, we have a duty towards our language.

 It was a mad decision. Thank God, the government realised its folly, said Bijoy Mohapatra, the president of the Orissa Gana Parishad. 

 Yesterday, Mohapatra had accused the chief minister of hatching a well-planned conspiracy to weed out Oriya, the states culture and self-respect as he is not well-versed with the language.

 The Orissa Sahitya Akademi also voiced its protest, calling the move retrograde and impractical.

 Higher education officials said the decision was taken on the basis of students enrolment in the last three academic years. Under the existing rules, there should be one teacher for 64 students. But in several colleges, a lecturer was teaching just a few pupils, they said.

 The Oriya literati described the decision as shameful. 

 Writer and poet Brajanath Rath said: Nowhere in India has such a thing happened. The government should see why students are not taking interest in taking up Oriya.

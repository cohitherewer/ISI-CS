The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Service for Sonia, paid by PMO

 RASHEED KIDWAI 

 Dec. 7: They work almost round the clock at 10 Janpath, fixing appointments, vetting the reports from AICC general secretaries, controlling access to the Congress president and even booking film tickets for Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra. But they get their salaries from Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs office.

 To the outside world, S.V. Pillay and P.P. Madhavan may not be familiar names; but to influential Congress members, they are Pillay Saheb and Madhavanji, the honorifics reflecting their power to decide who gets through to Sonia Gandhi and who doesnt.

 Considered the Congress chiefs eyes and ears, the two officials links with the Nehru-Gandhi family date back to the late 1980s when they became Rajiv Gandhis aides while working as Class II officials in the home ministry. They have not been to their parental office since then.

 When Rajiv became leader of the Opposition, they were accommodated as his personal staff, thus continuing to draw their salaries from the government.

 From 1992 to 1998, Pillay and Madhavan were reduced to serving a private person in Sonia, but P.V. Narasimha Rao ? who was Prime Minister till 1996 ? and his human resource development minister Madhavrao Scindia came to their aid.

 They allowed the duo to draw their salaries from the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA), a government-funded body headed then by Sonia. The arrangement continued under the United Front governments led by H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral.

 Sonias status as leader of the Opposition during 1999-2004 meant their salaries continued to come from the government without a hitch.

 Sonia declined the office of the Prime Minister after the May 2004 election victory, but her status as chairperson of the National Advisory Council (NAC) assured that Pillay and Madhavan continued in central government service.

 Their wages are now paid by the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) under which the NAC falls. Pillay and Madhavan, of course, are rarely seen at the NAC. 

 A senior PMO official said: There is nothing wrong in the PMO footing the bill. They are assisting the NAC chief and that is what matters.

 Sometime ago, the BJPs Vijay Kumar Malhotra had asked Sonia a question in the Lok Sabha relating to the NAC, prompting leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee to come to her rescue. 

 Pranab said parliamentary norms didnt allow a member to pose a direct query to another member.

 The government then decided that all questions relating to the NAC would be answered by the PMO.

 Contacted by The Telegraph, Madhavan said he had been serving Sonia for many years.

 At 10 Janpath, old faithful Vincent George has been rehabilitated, but in the matter of acting as an interface between Sonia and party leaders, his place near the throne has been taken over by Pillay and Madhavan.

 Pillay is perceived to be close to Priyanka and Madhavan to Rahul. The grapevine has it that Congress leaders who fail to gain entry to 10 Janpath make a beeline for Pillays or Madhavans home.

 In November 2001, Pillay had captained a 10 Janpath cricket team, which featured both Rahul and brother-in-law Robert Vadra, in a match against journalists covering the Congress beat. Pillays team had cruised to the required target of 141 with six overs to spare and eight wickets in hand.

 Apart from Madhavan, Rahuls team includes Kanishka Singh -- a former World Bank employee and son of former foreign secretary and present Arunachal Pradesh governor S.K. Singh -- and Namik, a Youth Congress activist from the Northeast.

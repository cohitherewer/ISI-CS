 Night bid to save Naga talks

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, June 8: National security adviser M.K. Narayanan today stepped in to save the Naga peace talks by holding a late-night closed-door meeting with Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah).

 The peace talks are gridlocked with both sides having apprised the other of their respective points of view over more than eight rounds of discussions and showing no signs of budging from them. 

 The Nagas are believed to have put forward their position in a logical and clear manner. They are unwilling to go beyond what they have offered in their last memorandum ? a re-negotiated federal relationship with India that cannot be changed by either side unilaterally.

 However, the Centre is unable to concede re-negotiation of the federal relationship between itself and Nagaland for fear of opening a Pandoras box. It also finds it difficult to agree to the integration of the Naga-inhabited areas of Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh with Nagaland though the NSCN (I-M) is ready for a two stage process ? recognising the legitimacy of the Naga demand for integration in the first stage and then finding an instrumentality for integration in the second. 

 The government is, however, encouraging the NSCN (I-M) leaders to hold discussions with political leaders from these states. To that end, Muivah recently held a meeting with the Naga legislators from some of these states in New Delhi.

 Meanwhile, some in the government are questioning the wisdom of inviting the top leadership of the NSCN (I-M) to India if no concessions are to be made to the militant organisation whose desire for peace has been apparent for quite some time. 

 Since the formal talks are not moving forward, a realisation seems to be dawning that if there is to be any breakthrough then it would possibly come through informal talks ? the meeting with Narayanan being the first such step. 

 Informal meetings are also to be held between Muivah and Oscar Fernandes, minister of state for programme implementation, who is leading a three-member team of ministers in the peace talks.

 Fernandes is likely to hold informal talks with Muivah after he completes the process of the Congresss internal elections, as he is chairman of the partys central election authority. The process of election or nomination is likely to be over in the next few days.

 CPM out to woo tribals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: The CPM is trying to use the forest rights bill to gain popularity among tribals who have remained outside their pale of influence in all states, except Bengal, Kerala and Tripura.

 The Congress, which had complete control over the tribals till the late 1990s, has lost much of its domain to RSS-sponsored outfits and Naxalites.

 Now, the CPM is moving into campaign mode on an issue it hopes would improve the partys image among tribals. 

 At a news conference in Delhi today, Bengals Left Front chairperson Biman Bose and party politburo member Brinda Karat said the CPM would launch a nationwide campaign to put pressure on the Centre to table the bill in the winter session of Parliament. 

 The movement will culminate in an all-India demands day on November 18 just before the beginning of the winter session on the 23rd of the month, Karat said.

 She said the CPM cannot accept the bill and has made a couple of recommendations, including removal of the 1980 cut-off date in the proposed legislation. If implemented, this will lead to mass evictions, Karat said.

 The CPM is also opposed to the ceiling of 2.5 hectares on tribal holdings.

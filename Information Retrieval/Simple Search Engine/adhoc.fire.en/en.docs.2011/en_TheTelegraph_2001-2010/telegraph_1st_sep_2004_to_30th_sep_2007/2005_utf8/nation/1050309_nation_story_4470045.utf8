 Kochi, March 8: This one is a Women?s Day gift for all those poor souls terrified of trawling Kerala?s backwaters alone: a spanking new all-women houseboat.

 A tourism group today launched an exclusive houseboat for women by women to cater to the needs of holidaymakers from within the country and abroad.

 ?I?ve met several women who feel unsafe to travel alone. The new service is dedicated to those women who would like to have a day out on Kerala?s scenic backwaters,? said Tomy Pulickattil, the proprietor of the group that launched the service.

 ?We wouldn?t have ventured into this but for the heck of it, plus the compulsions of finding a job for ourselves. We are also thrilled at being the first to run a special woman service, especially on a day marked for the weaker sex,? said Jomol Joy, 23, who controls the rudder.

 The 65 ft by 12 ft boat, made of local wood, is done up in traditional style and has an air-conditioned cabin towards the rear. It will not go on night cruises for the time being.

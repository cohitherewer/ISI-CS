 SC notice on Black Friday

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 21: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the 1993 Bombay serial blast case accused on the release of the controversial film Black Friday.

 Some of the accused had obtained a stay from Bombay High Court on the ground that the film based on the blasts, if released, would prejudice the trial against them.

 The high court had stayed the film?s release till the Tada court hearing the serial blast cases gave a judgment, although the film was cleared by the censor board. It had also admitted a petition filed by a group of the bomb blast accused against the release of the film.

 The producers of the film, Mid Day Multimedia Pvt Ltd, had filed an appeal in the apex court challenging the high court order.

 Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti issued the notices to Mustaq Musa Tarani and other accused. Senior counsel for the petitioner Harish Salve contended that the film was based on the book, Black Friday ? The Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts, which was available in the market and not banned by the authorities concerned.

 ?If the book was available in the public domain, then why could anybody not produce a film on that basis and how the film alone, and not the book, could create a bias in public mind against the accused?? Salve submitted before the apex court.

 Earlier, the high court had observed that the release of the film would amount to contempt of court and defamation of the accused as the judgement was still awaited.

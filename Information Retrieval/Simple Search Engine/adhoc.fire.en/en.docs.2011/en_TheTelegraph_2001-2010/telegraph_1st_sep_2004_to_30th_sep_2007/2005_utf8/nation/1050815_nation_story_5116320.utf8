 Pandits demand

 Jammu, Aug. 14: Kashmiri Pandits are demanding they be given better accommodation and a bigger monthly dole before they are restored their homes in the Valley, reports our correspondent.

 Community leader M.L. Raina said at a news conference the existing one-room tenements were too small for us to live and the government should immediately start construction of two-room ones.

 The monthly relief of Rs 3,000 per month should be doubled given rising prices, he added.

 The demands are being made at a time over 200 residential quarters have already been built in the Valley on applications from nearly 1,500 families.

 About Rs 560 million has been spent on the rehabilitation plan.

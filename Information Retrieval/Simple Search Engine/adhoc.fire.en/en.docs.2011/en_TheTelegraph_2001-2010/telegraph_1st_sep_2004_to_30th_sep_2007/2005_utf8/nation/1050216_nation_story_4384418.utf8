 Snow no bar for Kabul trip

 BHARAT BHUSHAN 

 Kabul, Feb. 15: At one point it seemed that external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh would not be able to begin his visit to Afghanistan on an auspicious note. At 8 in the morning, Kabul airport was snowed under and closed. The Indian Air Force and the foreign ministry went helter-skelter to reschedule the flight to Islamabad instead. 

 Departure was announced for Islamabad. As the special air force aircraft ferrying the minister and his entourage readied for take-off, the weather in Kabul cleared suddenly and the flight was re-directed to Afghanistan.

 Was it worth going to Kabul in near-freezing temperatures for less than five hours? Every minute of it. 

 So what if the delegation could not visit Baghe-Babur or the Habibia School being repaired and rehabilitated with Indian help? Singh was able to gift a consignment of 50 new 4.5-ton Tata trucks to the fledgling Afghan National Army. 

 Singh also handed over the key of the new surgical block of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Kabul built by the Indian central public works department to the Afghan authorities. This 250-bed hospital was being built by India in 1972 when work was suspended due to the situation in Afghanistan. Delhi returned to complete the unfinished task. 

 Indians are the flavour of the season in Afghanistan because they have stood by the people in their worst days. So when President Hamid Karzai told Singh that Afghans could only give India ?affection? in return for what it has done, he was not being insincere. 

 India has committed $400 million to Afghanistan supplying not only Airbuses, but also building schools, supplying public transport buses, setting up hospitals, warehouses, cold storages, telecom networks, digging wells, putting up electricity distribution networks, building a dam, opening a bank, sending doctors, teachers, computer experts as well as building an arterial road from Zaranj to Dilaram linking Afghanistan with the Iranian port of Chabahar. 

 All this has been done in a very low-key manner. And Singh has promised to do more. Karzai told Singh when he met him this afternoon that the prevailing sentiment in Afghanistan towards India was one of deep affection. Recounting the historical and cultural ties between the two countries, Karzai declared: ?India and Afghanistan have found each other again.?

 Karzai told Singh that in the last three years, many countries had come forward to assist in the rebuilding of Afghanistan but ?the best assistance came from India?. So not only could India expect affection from the Afghans but also economic opportunities in their country as well as trade routes to Central Asia.

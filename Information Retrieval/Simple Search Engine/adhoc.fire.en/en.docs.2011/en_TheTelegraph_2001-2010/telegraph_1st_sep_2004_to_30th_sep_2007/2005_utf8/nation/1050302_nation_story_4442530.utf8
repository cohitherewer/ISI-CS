 Court clears Noise 

 Mumbai, March 1 (PTI): Bombay High Court allowed the premiere of Vinta Nanda?s English film White Noise in Delhi today and refused to ban its release until financial dispute between the makers of the movie was settled.

 The court, however, ordered the filmmakers to deposit with the registrar Rs 25 lakh by Friday when the film is slated to be released in theatres all over India and also submit a bank guarantee of Rs 15 lakh by March 18. 

 Police were also directed not to seize the prints of the film on the basis of a complaint made by one of the partners citing a financial dispute.

 The court delivered the order on a petition filed by Uday Vasta, one of the partners of M/S Trioka Pictures that made the film. The film was made by Vasta, Nanda and Mohanjit Singh but a dispute arose after its completion.

 The counsel for Vasta argued that the film should not be allowed to be released because of the financial dispute. 

 Nanda?s counsel assured the court that the respondents were ready to submit before it accounts of the film but urged the judges not to ban the film?s release.

 Amethi cheers rahul speech, mix-up and all

 After the floor of the House, Rahul Gandhi took the ground of his constituency to make his maiden full-fledged public speech at the inauguration of the construction of the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Information Technology (PTI picture on right).

 The first-time Amethi MP was the last to take the microphone, a little nervously, after Union minister Arjun Singh, IT legend F.C. Kohli and local Congress leaders like Sanjay Singh.

 ?It is a great pleasure for me to inaugurate the construction of an IT campus in Amethi which was actually my father?s dream,? began Rahul, who last month delivered his first speech in Parliament on the plight of sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh.

 ?Till the construction of the complex, the classes would begin in Allahabad and finally be shifted here,? Rahul said.

 As he went on, the pages, written in Hindi, got mixed up. But that did not fluster the budding leader. He regretted the mix-up and continued extempore.

 ?I believe whatever is happening in the IT sector in India is due to the initiative my father had taken. He was a visionary and remained committed to his goal despite a section of political leaders ridiculing him,? Rahul said in his six-minute speech.

 The crowd at a sprawling ground at Tikarmafi, comprising mostly students and teachers, roared its support and shouted ?Rahul Gandhi zindabad?.

 Local Congress workers were enthused by the maiden speech. ?It was a little over one minute in Parliament and Soniaji?s average period of public speech is 10-16 minutes. Rahul is not bad at six minutes. He faltered but he will learn,? a local youth Congress leader said.

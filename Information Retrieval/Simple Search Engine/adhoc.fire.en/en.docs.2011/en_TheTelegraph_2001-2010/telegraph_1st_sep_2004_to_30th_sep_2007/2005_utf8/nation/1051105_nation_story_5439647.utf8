 Intelligence green light for security network

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: The decks have been cleared for an elaborate internal security system that will zero in on anyone hatching terrorist plots and try to catch them before they can carry out strikes.

 The system, which has received the intelligence agencies approval, is based broadly on Americas homeland security. It will link all kinds of computer systems in every corner of the country into a mind-boggling network for processing and analysing information.

 The data will be collated from various sources ? records of fingerprints, mobile calls, travel, and credit card and bank transactions. The nerve centre will have access to all databases in the country and will have identification details of every citizen.

 The analysis will be done by experts from the universities, science and strategic institutes, intelligence agencies, security forces and defence establishments.

 The idea is to get data, information, intelligence and analysis from all possible sources and process it at one place with the help of the best experts. The system will even be able to predict likely future movements of terrorist organisations and possible strikes, an official said.

 The Intelligence Bureau and RAW were initially uncomfortable with the idea but gave their consent after being assured the new system would not interfere with their work. The two agencies have suggested certain modifications to the original draft, prepared by IIT Kanpur, which was put before them following home ministry clearance.

 Key officials say the new system will take at least two years to start functioning. Besides IIT Kanpur, which will act as a nodal point, many other universities and institutes will be involved.

 Once the nerve centre is set up, it will dramatically increase co-ordination between the Centre, states, district and local authorities and the private sector partners. It will operate 24x7, 365 days a year. The cost hasnt been worked out.

 But he indicated the CBI may consider this later, which could mean it will try to get another confessional statement from Salem. 

 Mumbai polices anti-terrorist squad, probing the Pradeep Jain murder, said it would make Salem undergo scientific (probably lie-detector) tests because there wasnt enough time for conventional questioning to yield results. The police have contacted forensic laboratories in Ahmedabad and Bangalore.

 A Bhopal court today issued a fresh production warrant against Monica Bedi seeking her appearance on December 5. She has not been brought from Hyderabad so far as enough train seats were not available.

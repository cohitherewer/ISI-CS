 Denel trouble 

 Durban, Oct. 19 (PTI): South Africas state arms manufacturer Denel, which lost a multi-billion dollar deal with India because of allegations of corruption, has said the company is not viable.

 The firms recently-appointed CEO Shaun Liebenberg, who earlier informed a parliamentary select committee here yesterday that the company could face losses of up to 1.6 billion Rand (Rs 1,120 crore) this year, said in an interview on radio that Denel was no longer viable, and about seven thousand jobs could be on the line at the company.

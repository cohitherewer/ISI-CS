 Tehelka cases filed

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The CBI has registered two corruption cases in the Tehelka sting operation against two retired army officers and a former Samata Party treasurer, reports our special correspondent.

 In December, the bureau had registered five cases against former BJP president Bangaru Laxman, former Samata president Jaya Jaitley and their aides, as well as defence ministry officials and a retired army officer, after the government formally ordered the bureau to launch a thorough probe into offences revealed in the Tehelka tapes.

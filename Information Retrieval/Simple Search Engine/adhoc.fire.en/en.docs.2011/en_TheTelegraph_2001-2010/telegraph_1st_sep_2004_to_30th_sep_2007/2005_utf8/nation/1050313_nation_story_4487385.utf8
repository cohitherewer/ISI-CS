 Something foul in fair masseurs

 Mumbai, March 12: A boxed ad in the classified section in a Sunday paper claims: ?Indian British Russian Spanish. Ayurved masseurs available. Contact Jennifer.? 

 Another just below it runs: ?Indian, Polish, Russian. Credit cards accepted here. Contact Pamela.? In the same page there are ads ? boxed again ? of ?Thai, Bangkok-type body massage by Russian, Indian, European?. A fourth one again promises Indian, Russian and European Ayurved masseurs 24x7. 

 All of them provide addresses in western suburbs, around Juhu and the international airport, and contact numbers, though ?Captain?, a contact person in one such ad, who picks up the phone, says that he only has Indian girls, despite advertising ?Russians? and ?Europeans?.

 But Mumbai police say that this form of multiculturalism is a problem they are finding quite difficult to tackle.

 While the back offices of the entertainment world are also filling up with white-skinned women ? hot firang bodies are crowding remix videos, interminable telemarketing ads for the instant fat-reducer, or even sleazy bars trying to pass themselves off as Irish or Scottish or British pubs, with or without beer ? the fair, young and lovely women are also filtering into Mumbai?s high-end sex trade in steady numbers.

 ?It is difficult to estimate how many of them are here at one given point,? says Sanjay Apranti, deputy commissioner of police, enforcement branch. ?But they are very visible in the city and we are trying to track down on the network through which they operate,? he adds.

 Most of them are from countries in east Europe and former USSR, though generically billed as ?Russians? or, at the most, ?Polish?, in the ads that crowd the classifieds during the weekends. One glimpses the originals, especially in the suburban five-star hotels near the international airport during weekends, getting down from a private car, waiting in the lounge, making a call and then disappearing into the elevator. 

 Like any other high-society operator, the ?Natashas?, as they are often referred to, may also operate from flats in affluent suburban areas.

 It is abject poverty in their countries and the Indian men?s obsession with white-skinned women that make the women land here.

 ?Most of them come from the poorest European countries without valid papers,? says Apranti. ?We ?rescued? three foreign women here last month,? he says. ?One was from Uzbekistan and two were from Morocco,? he said.

 The Uzbek woman has a child back home to support.

 ?They will be under probation for some time, after which they will be sent back home,? says the official.

 ?Through them, we are also trying to gather more information about the network. We believe that the foreigners land in New Delhi first, from where they are sent to different metros, their number depending on the spending power of the city.? 

 The women usually belong to the sex trade back in their homes, too, and are brought to India through the network in their countries.

 ?It works out for them,? says Apranti. ?Because they charge around Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per client. They stay for a few months and go back home with a lot of money,? he says.

 ?But it is difficult to trap them. We have spent Rs 30,000 in our operations already to trap foreign women,? Apranti adds.

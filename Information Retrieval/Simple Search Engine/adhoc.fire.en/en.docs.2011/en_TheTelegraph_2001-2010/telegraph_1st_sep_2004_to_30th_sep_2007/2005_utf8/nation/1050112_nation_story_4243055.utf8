 Farooq drops poll boycott

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Jan. 11: The National Conference has announced its participation in the forthcoming civic elections, reversing its decision to boycott polls under the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government.

 NC president Omar Abdullah told a news conference today that his party would contest the municipal corporation/council and town area committee polls being held in the state after more than 25 years. ?We will participate in the interest of democracy.? 

 In October last year, after it lost the Assembly byelection from its strongest bastion Srinagar, the party had declared it would not participate in any poll held under the current government. The NC charged the Mufti regime with rigging and manipulating results.

 Abdullah said the decision has been guided by an overwhelming view in the party leadership in favour of participating in the elections. The leaders, who met here yesterday and today, said that having laid the foundations of democracy in the state, the NC could not shy away from elections.

 The change of stand has come as a huge relief for the state government. The absence of the main Opposition party would have been an embarrassment for the ruling coalition, riding high on the crest of holding civic elections.

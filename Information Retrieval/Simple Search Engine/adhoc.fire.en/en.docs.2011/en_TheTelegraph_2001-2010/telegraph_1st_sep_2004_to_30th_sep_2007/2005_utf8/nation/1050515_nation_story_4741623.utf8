 Shoaib catches Bhatts nazar

 - Will he or wont he?

 RrawalPindi Express: Shoaib at a practice session 

 The derailed Rawalpindi Express could soon start chugging again ? on a different set of tracks. And the engine driver could be Mahesh Bhatt.

 The filmmaker is leaving for Pakistan tomorrow, with wife Soni Razdan in tow, to woo dropped Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar to play a gangster in his newest film by the same name.

 The 29-year-old cricketer, heartbroken after being overlooked for Pakistans tour of West Indies, has yet to agree to the proposal and appeared reluctant to try his hand at acting. 

 I am too busy playing cricket, Shoaib said when contacted by The Telegraph today. I really dont know if they (Bhatt and Co.) are coming.

 Bhatt said he was drawn to the face that most Indian cricket fans love to hate because it combined vulnerability with a raw animal instinct.

 We were looking out for a person who had the combination of a young vulnerable face with the rawness of an animal instinct.

 Earlier, we had thought of Sunjay Dutt but there were date problems. So, when Meera, the actress of my film Nazar, suggested Shoaib, I jumped at the idea, he said.

 Bhatt, who will be promoting Nazar during his stay in Pakistan, said Meera had taken the initiative to put him through to Shoaib. After things with Sunjay and John Abraham did not work out, she got hold of Shoaibs phone number and got things rolling, he said.

 Shoaib was initially amused by the idea but when he realised the role was real and was offered to Sunjay Dutt, he took it seriously and has agreed to meet me when I fly to Pakistan, he said. But Shoaib did not confirm that he had spoken to Bhatt.

 The filmmaker, too, cautioned that nothing had been finalised yet. It is only after I meet the cricketer that the picture would be clear, he said.

 We will try and convince him about the need to use cricket and cinema to boost ties and bring a change in the relationship between the countries.

 As soon as Shoaib agrees to the proposal, shooting will commence, Bhatt said. Most of the film, to be directed by Anurag Basu, will be shot abroad.

 We wanted someone who could look harsh and hard and yet would have a vulnerable loverboy side to him, Basu said.

 Bhatt is also scheduled to call on Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. He said he would discuss using cinema as a confidence-building measure between the countries.

 Fronts add to poll haze

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: As the Janata Dal (United) continues to woo Lok Janshakti Party chief Ramvilas Paswan for an alliance, three fronts have been formed in poll-bound Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana, compounding confusion.

 Despite Paswan insisting that he would consider a tie-up with the Dal (U) only if it quits the NDA, the party is keeping its hopes alive. The Dal (U) rank and file appears confused whether or not to stick with the NDA. Parliamentary board members, including Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav, met at George Fernandes? residence this evening to discuss electoral strategy.

 With time running out and no serious dialogue on seat-sharing held yet, BJP president L.K. Advani yesterday summoned Fernandes and Yadav. The BJP, sources said, fears that Nitish Kumar is delaying talks as he is waiting for a response from the Congress before junking the NDA.

 Jharkhand Vikas Dal president and former MP Suraj Mandal, a one-time associate of Shibu Soren, the Jharkhand Vananchal Congress and the Marxist Coordination Committee have formed a front along with the LJP. They are also talking to the CPI-ML (Liberation).

 In Bihar, a front comprising eight parties ? the Samata Party, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal, CPI (ML), Samajwadi Janata Party, Soshit Samaj Dal, Bhartiya Momin Front and the Krantikari Communist Party ? has been formed to take on the RJD front and the BJP-led alliance.

 Haryana, too, has a new front that includes the Rashtriya Lok Dal, Samajwadi Party, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Mazdoor Party and the Samata Party.

 Student rescued, along with ransom

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 28: Policemen trailing the father of a kidnapped student rescued him from Ghaziabad last night and got hold of Rs 3 crore that had just been handed over as ransom.

 A hunt has since been launched for a government contractor, Rahul Tyagi, who allegedly masterminded the abduction of Baibhab Agarwal, 16, the son of a securities firm owner and share broker.

 Tyagis wife is a medical practitioner in the army, Uttar Pradesh director-general of police Yashpal Singh said today. We may interrogate the army wife of the contractor, he added.

 Singh described Tyagi as a first-time offender.

 A special task force of Uttar Pradesh police has arrested his garage manager, to whom the ransom money was handed over in a park close to the flat where the boy had been kept.

 The police said Baibhab was picked up on June 10 on his way to a coaching centre in Kota, where he attended classes to prepare for engineering entrance tests.

 The kidnappers sought Rs 10 crore from his father, Ramnath, who is based in Mumbai. The final deal was struck at Rs 3 crore. 

 Baibhabs father and an uncle were unaware that the police were following them last night. 

 After they handed over the money to the manager around 11 pm, plainclothesmen surrounded them. The manager led them to the flat owned by the Ghaziabad Development Authority.

 Uttar Pradesh police had teamed up with their Delhi and Rajasthan counterparts in their bid to locate Baibhab. 

 Rs 3 crore could be the highest ransom paid by a victims family in Uttar Pradesh, said the police chief.

 Yasin spills secret, Rashid denies

 Islamabad/Delhi, June 14: Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chief Yasin Maliks revelation that about 3,500 militants of his outfit were trained in a camp set up by Pakistan information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad in the late eighties has raised eyebrows in Delhi.

 However, after sparking the controversy, Malik, now in Pakistan as a member of a separatist delegation, backtracked today. He said he had merely referred to the hospitality extended by Rashid to fellow Kashmiris, not to any arms training for militants.

 Yesterday, at a gathering in Islamabad, where the minister was also present, the JKLF chief said: Sheikh Rashid has played a great role for Kashmirs liberation. He used to support the frontline jihadis but very few people know about his contribution. 

 Rashid refused to comment on the statement yesterday. Today, he denied Maliks claim. I have never taken part in any activities in which terrorism and training camps were involved, he told a TV channel in Pakistan. He said it was for Malik to explain his comments.

 But noted Pakistani journalist and TV anchor Hamid Mir seconded the separatist leaders comments. The camp was run between 1988 and 1990 at his (Rashids) Fateh Jung farmhouse which was also called Freedom House, he said, adding that the camp was well-known to the media.

 The journalist said Malik might have revealed the details without realising the negative impact it would have on the ministers proposed visit to Kashmir on June 30 by the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus. 

 Delhi has taken serious note of the comment, which, it says, is contrary to assurances given by Pakistan against terrorism. Foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said: It is particularly serious that people directly involved in such activities continue to occupy high positions in Pakistan. 

 Indications are Rashid would not be allowed to travel to Srinagar now.

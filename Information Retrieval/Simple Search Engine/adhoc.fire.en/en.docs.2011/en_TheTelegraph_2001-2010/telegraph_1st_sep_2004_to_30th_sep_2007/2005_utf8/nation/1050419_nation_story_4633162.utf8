 Three killed in twin cities

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 18: Gunshots shattered the calm in Bhubaneswar and neighbouring Cuttack today as two contractors and a postgraduate student of SCB Medical College fell to the bullets of criminals. 

 In an incident that has sent shockwaves through the capital, two civil contractors were gunned down in broad daylight in the busy Unit-8 area this afternoon. 

 It was around 1 pm and Subash Dash, a 30-year-old civil contractor with a criminal record, was on his way to the office of the executive engineer (drainage division) at Delta Colony Square along with his friend Dhirendra Sethi when six motorcycle-borne youths attacked them.

 ?A group of six unidentified persons came from nowhere and ambushed them,? said Amitabh Thakur, Bhubaneswar superintendent of police. 

 Dash hailed from Jhanjirimangala in Cuttack while Sethi stayed in the Baramunda area of Bhubaneswar. 

 Dash, who received injuries on his head and chest, died on the spot while Sethi died at SCB Medical College and Hospital.

 Minutes after the attack, a police team led by Thakur gave chase but the assailants had by then disappeared down a narrow lane. The police have detained four youths for interrogation.

 ?The shop-owners of the area were tight-lipped and failed to provide any description of the killers? said a police officer.

 While the police suspect that the incident was a fallout of a long-standing feud between two criminals gangs, Thakur did not rule out the possibility of rivalry over tenders. 

 The fallout of the Bhubaneswar murder was felt in Cuttack in the evening when a postgraduate medical student from Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala was killed after a bullet from a criminal escaping the police pierced his chest. Arun Kumar, a sixth-year student, was travelling inside the college campus when he was hit by the bullet. 

 Santosh Kumar Paschimakabat, the assailant, was making a call from a phone booth near the anatomy department of the hospital where the body of Sethi was kept for post mortem. 

 An hour ago, Bhubaneswar police had informed their counterparts in Cuttack of the murder of the two contractors and asked them to stay alert. Police said Paschimakabat, one of the six youths involved in the Bhubaneswar murder, had followed the critically-injured Sethi to Cuttack.

 Bhoi, a sub-inspector of Mangalabag police station, spotted Paschimakabat, a known criminal, in the booth and nabbed him after a short chase. The criminal, while being taken to the police station, jumped out of the jeep and shot at the sub-inspector but missed his target. Instead, the bullet hit Kumar and killed him. Paschimakabat was later arrested. Both Bhubaneswar and Cuttack police have lodged FIRs in connection with the deaths.

 Tension prevailed on the campus as students raised slogans against the police. Two platoons of police have been deployed and the district authorities were huddled in a meeting with the SPs of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar.

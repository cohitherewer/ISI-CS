 Pollution panel sniffs fuel foul play

 OCTANE STINK? 

 New Delhi, April 2: The Central Pollution Control Board has alerted environment watchdogs that oil companies could mix ?octane enhancers? in petrol to meet the strict Euro III norms.

 As petrol has to maintain octane ratings, refineries often use enhancers, which are manganese-based fuel additives that ensure vehicles do not knock or stall and maintain burn efficiency.

 The norms were introduced yesterday in 11 cities ? Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore, Pune, Ahmedabad, Agra, Kanpur, Surat and Hyderabad ? as recommended by the Mashelkar Committee on auto-fuel policy.

 After the pollution control board observed that oil refineries in Delhi-Mathura, Panipat and the Northeast were stocking up on manganese, the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment demanded a ban on toxic octane enhancers like methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT).

 MMT is used in China, Indonesia and Africa. Like lead, it has a small effect on cutting octane levels but emits fine particles laden with manganese oxides, which are neurotoxins that can cause brain damage when inhaled.

 The Delhi Pollution Control Committee has sent letters to some oil refineries asking them not to use the octane enhancers. Although some have assured it no such thing will be done, environmentalists fear it might be used in fuel meant for other states.

 Oil majors in the US and Europe have stopped using MMT. But it has begun to make inroads in Asia and Africa that have recently banned leaded petrol and do not have adequate safeguards against toxic additives.

 ?There are fears MMT is being dumped in Asia,? said Anumita Roychoudhury of the Centre for Science and Environment.

 ?The refineries have written that the oil will not be used in Delhi but what about the rest of the country? They are quiet about that,? she added.

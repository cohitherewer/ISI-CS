 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: The air force is developing its base in Kalaikunda near Kharagpur in Bengal for joint training with foreign air forces. The first exercise from Kalaikunda with fighter aircraft from the US Air Force is scheduled to be held by the end of the year.

 Aircraft operating out of Kalaikunda for training and exercises usually fly in airspace over the Bay of Bengal. Kalaikunda, originally a Second World War base built by Britain?s Royal Air Force, is home to the IAF?s MiG 27 fighter squadrons.

 The assistant chief of air staff (operations), Air Vice-Marshal S.C. Mukul, said here today that Kalaikunda will be the second IAF base to be upgraded to host teams from foreign air forces. The first is the hub for Mirage squadrons at Gwalior.

 A US Air Force and the Indian Air Force deployed fighter aircraft for joint exercises in Gwalior last year for the first time in three decades after the frostiness in military to military relations wore out. 

 The Kalaikunda base would have better billeting facilities for foreign teams. The US sent F-15e Tomcats and the IAF Sukhoi 30K and Mirages for the ?Cope Thunder? exercise. The US is considering sending F-16 fighter aircraft ? that the IAF is looking at with interest as a possible acquisition ? for this year?s drill.

 ?We are developing international facilities at the base so that it can host joint manoeuvres,? he said and expected the facilities to be ready for the second India-US fighter exercises likely in November-December this year.

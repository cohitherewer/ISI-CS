 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The Supreme Court today ordered a fresh probe to ascertain the truth behind Zahira Sheikh?s ?retraction of her statements? and her alleged ?intimidation? by Teesta Setalvad in the Best Bakery case.

 Zahira has retracted her statements thrice in the case. The last time, Zahira alleged that she was held ?captive? by Teesta who pressured her to issue statements. Zahira said Teesta sought to ?sell the story? abroad, especially to a few select sheikhs, and mint money.

 However, Teesta contended before the Supreme Court today that VHP and BJP leaders in Vadodara had ?lured? Zahira into changing her statement by promising enormous amounts of money.

 Charges and counter-charges flew in court this afternoon between Anil Devan, the advocate for Teesta, Zahira?s lawyer P.N. Lekhi and K.T.S. Tulsi, the counsel for the accused who are in jail. Tulsi contended that his clients were ?caught in the crossfire? and were ?unnecessarily incarcerated?.

 The bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and H.K. Sema described the situation as ?very delicate? and directed the registrar-general of the court to take the help of a Delhi police official of inspector-general rank and probe the basis of Zahira?s statements and Teesta?s affidavits.

 Outside the court, lawyers discussed how Zahira and Teesta had of late developed differences and were now trading charges against each other.

 The court had earlier ordered transfer of the trial in the Best Bakery case from Gujarat to Maharashtra and quashed the acquittal of all 21 accused in the case. But Zahira alleged that no affidavit signed by her was presented before the Supreme Court in the entire period when it dealt with the case.

 However, the apex court today refused to modify its order transferring the trial to Maharashtra. ?We are of the considered view that a detailed inquiry is necessary to ascertain if Zahira was telling the truth and which version of her is the truthful account of what she has allegedly seen or not seen,? the court said.

 ?Various documents have been placed to show that she made departures from her statements made in the past. Allegations have been made that she had been threatened and bullied by Teesta. On the other hand, allegations were made that Zahira was threatened and lured to change her statement,? the judges said.

 In Mumbai, Zahira, who has turned hostile in the case, continued to evade questions today at the special court, leading judge Abhay Thipse to express his dissatisfaction on several occasions. 

 Zahira first indicated that she does not understand what an affidavit means but later accepted that it is a document on which the applicant must sign.

 An affidavit in her name was filed in the apex court asking for a retrial, saying she had turned hostile during the first trial in Vadodara under pressure. On January 4, she filed another affidavit at the apex court denying she had filed the earlier affidavit. 

 She told the special court today that she did not know if her mother and her sister Sahira, both of whom turned hostile during the retrial, had received any compensation from the government.

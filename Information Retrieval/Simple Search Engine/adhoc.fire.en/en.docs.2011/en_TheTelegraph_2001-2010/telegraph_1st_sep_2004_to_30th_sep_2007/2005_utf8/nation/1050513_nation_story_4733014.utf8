 Patna, May 12: Friday the thirteenth it will be.

 Tomorrow, Sadhu and Subhash Yadav, both MPs and brothers of former chief minister Rabri Devi, will finally vacate the official bungalows they have been occupying for years. So will Union ministers Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav and Akhilesh Singh.

 That was the assurance a team of magistrates, with some two dozen policemen in tow, got from Laloo Prasad Yadavs brothers-in-law when they went there to get the prime properties vacated.

 But not before high drama on both premises, as the police guards at the gates would not let the eviction team enter because their sahibs were away in Delhi attending Parliament.

 The bungalows ? 10 Janpath of Sadhu and 3 Desh Ratna Marg of Subhash ? are on roads flanking 1 Anne Marg, where Rabri Devi continues to stay in her capacity as a former chief minister. Her husband stays in an inter-connected bungalow.

 The straight hand of the law wilted by considerable degrees as the officers were reluctant to act tough in evicting the illegal occupants who, till recently, were among the most powerful people in Bihar.

 The wait at Sadhus place was worth a clean three hours. Why doesnt he (magistrate) give us orders to enter? We can get it vacated within minutes, said a policeman. After prolonged persuasion, the magistrates were allowed in, followed soon by a tractor-trailer.

 The media teams followed but the magistrates pleaded with them to wait outside. He (Sadhu) is still in official possession of this house. It is unfair for you to come in, magistrate S.N. Pandey said.

 A sofa and a few chairs were loaded on to the tractor and it left for an unknown destination. This house will be in the governments possession by tomorrow. That is the assurance we have got. We have orders to get these bungalows vacated at the earliest, he said. 

 Sadhus usual horde of supporters was missing from the scene. But most vehicles heading to the airport slowed down to capture the moment ? among the rarest of the rare here.

 Governor Buta Singh had recently issued orders that all bungalows in the unauthorised possession of politicians should be vacated whether or not the occupant, if he/she happens to be an MP, has been allocated a house in Delhi. Patna High Court also reacted strongly. 

 By 2.45 pm, the scene shifted to Subhashs bungalow. At least three district officials approached the closed gate. The guards refused to open it. Nobody is home. Come tomorrow, said one of them. A magistrate shot back: Gate to kholna hi hoga. We have orders to get this house vacated.

 After 15 minutes, a youth in khadi let them in. A magistrate said he was made to speak to Subhash over the phone. Subhashji has promised to hand over the keys tomorrow. We have got similar assurances from Akhilesh Singh and Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav.

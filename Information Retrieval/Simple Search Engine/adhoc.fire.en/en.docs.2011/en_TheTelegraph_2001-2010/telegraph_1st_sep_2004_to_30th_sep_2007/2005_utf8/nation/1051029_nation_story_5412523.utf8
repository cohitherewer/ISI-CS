 VHP sends truce signal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad today signalled that it was ready to call a truce with the BJP, describing the party as the single largest Hindu force in the country. 

 Addressing a news conference, VHP chief Ashok Singhal said the Sangh parivar was united despite some differences at the top.

 Hindu politics is the need of the hour, Singhal said, adding that he had never spoken of floating a separate Hindu political party but only of clinching alliances with like-minded forces.

 In the BJP, Singhals assertions were construed as the final confirmation that with L.K. Advanis imminent exit as party president, it was unity time. 

 Singhal has been one of the strongest critics of Advani and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 

 Vajpayee came under attack for betraying the Ram temple cause when the NDA was in power. 

 Singhal was, however, harsher on the BJP chief. According to the VHP, Advanis political career was built on the Ayodhya movement and the VHP had helped him become deputy Prime Minister, but having secured what he wanted, he junked the Sangh and started to pursue secular politics.

 I know about the people there (the BJP). May be some outsiders, who joined the party as it grew, are secular in their actions and ideology. But over 85 per cent of the party is united with the parivar except at the top, Singhal said, alluding to Vajpayee and Advani. 

 Asked about the change in stance, the VHP leader said: We have never criticised the party but only its policies. We are not their followers nor will we ever be.

 According to RSS sources, Singhals statements reflect the outcome of the recent meet in Chitrakoot, which drew up a set of dos and donts for the parivar. Chief among them was to urge the VHP to give up its demand for a separate Hindu party now that Advani was soon going to be out of the way and the BJP had agreed to toe the Hindutva line until it reconsolidated itself in the Hindi heartland.

 Double punch softens up Sangh

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 (Top) Vajpayee, Singh: 

 Hitting hard

 New Delhi, Sept. 27: After Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Jaswant Singh publicly backed L.K. Advanis views on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-BJP relationship, the Sangh has toned down its anti-Advani stance and acknowledged him as a senior leader of the BJP.

 The nuanced shift was evident during Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhavs interaction with the media. He stressed that Advani would be part of any BJP-Sangh engagement in the near future to discuss the suggestions in his concluding address at the Chennai national executive and other matters. 

 Advani had attacked the Sangh mainly for trying to deny the BJP the space and autonomy it needed to function as a mainstream political party.

 Madhav would not specify a date for the meeting which, Sangh sources said, would be a chintan baithak and could take place before the Sanghs national executive in Chitrakoot from October 22. 

 Madhav described the Sangh-BJP relations as normal, adding: We have got several suggestions from seniors like Advani and we shall discuss them when we sit together.

 He refused to be drawn on Vajpayees insinuation that the Sangh was trying to limit the thought process, but claimed the Sangh is not inflexible. The Sangh does not have fixed ideas. We always think and rethink our programmes and ideology ? it is a continuous process, he said.

 Yesterday, Jaswant Singh had echoed Vajpayee and said: If you put a lock on new ideas, a party or organisation loses its dynamism and becomes stagnant.

 BJP sources said Madhavs views do not necessarily reflect those of Sangh boss K.S. Sudarshan, who is still determined to see Advani out before December ? the BJP chiefs own deadline for quitting the post. 

 The Sangh, the sources added, was beginning to realise that it was time the battle ceased to be seen as an ego clash between Sudarshan and Advani. 

 If the BJP was harmed by the events of the past three months or so, the Sangh has not escaped unscathed either. This is the first time in its history that the supremo went public with his criticism of a parivar member, a source said.

 In a Sangh conclave in Surat in July, Sudarshan had expressed regret for a TV interview in which he had hinted that Advani and Vajpayee should retire from politics. Sudarshan had also spoken uncharitably about Vajpayees foster family and his former national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra.

 There is a feeling that Sudarshans reported perception of Advani controlling the BJP through a coterie of self-seekers may apply equally to the Sangh, as Sudarshan is himself believed to be in the clutches of his hand-picked advisers.

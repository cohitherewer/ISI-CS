 Delhi to host tourism summit 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: The largest annual international gathering of private and public players in tourism will take place in Delhi as India gains importance as a destination.

 The fifth edition of the global travel and tourism summit, organised by the World Travel and Tourism Council, will be held from April 8 to 10.

 Among those arriving in the capital for the event include the ministers of tourism from Egypt, Greece and Turkey, and presidents, chairmen, CEOs and managing directors aplenty ? from international hotel chains to airlines. Jean-Claude Baumgarten, the council?s president, will also be present.

 ?We had wanted to host the event in India for a while. This time, it was a choice between Washington, Shanghai and Delhi. We won because India is an upcoming market and, for the past two years or so, people have been recognising that,? said Lalit Suri, the chairman of the council?s India initiative and chairman, Bharat Hotels Ltd.

 ?In fact, there will be an India focus, with a special presentation on the prospects of tourism in this country, and how the infrastructure here has improved in the past few years,? he said.

 The council, a global business leaders? forum, represents the private sector in the industry worldwide.

 The summit, to be inaugurated by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has as the theme Realising the Potential and will feature a series of debates, panel discussions and interactive sessions on various aspects of the travel and tourism sector.

 ?On April 6, we will have an executive committee meeting in Agra. Next day, we have a meeting in Delhi and, then from April 8, the summit begins. 

 ?There will be a lot of cultural events, with the dinner every night being hosted by different players. The first night?s event is being jointly organised by the tourism ministry of India and ITC at Red Fort,? added Suri.

 The talks will focus on issues like where it will be right for the public and private sectors to collaborate and where it will not, the launch of a new economic tool to help forecast the economic impact of a disaster and estimate the speed of recovery, and a debate on the best way for the industry to communicate in the face of catastrophes.

 A discussion involving tourism ministers from four countries, including India?s Renuka Chowdhury, will explore the strategies necessary to make a destination successful and the role of the government.

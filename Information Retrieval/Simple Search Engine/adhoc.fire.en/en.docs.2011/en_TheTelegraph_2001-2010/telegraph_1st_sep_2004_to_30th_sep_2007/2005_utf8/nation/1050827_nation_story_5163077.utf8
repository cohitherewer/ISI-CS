 Damages blow to Hutch over bill

 New Delhi (PTI): A consumer forum has 

 directed Hutchison-Essar to cough up Rs 12,000 for disconnecting 

 services to a consumer for non-payment of bill before the 

 due date of payment and without any intimation.

 Hanuman Prasad Ganeriwala, a businessman, who found his phone was disconnected on September 24, 2004, two days before the last date of payment, lodged a complaint with the consumer redressal forum.

 One can imagine the plight of a person, who is paying his bills regularly and suddenly without any intimation his cellphone is disconnected. Socially, it is considered dishonour and disgrace of a person for which Hutchison-Essar Telecom Ltd is responsible, the forum said.

 Hutch argued the move was in accordance with the conditions printed on the back of its application forms. 

 The court, however, said they are so minutely written that they cannot be read even with a microscope.

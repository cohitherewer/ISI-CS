 Not just Taliban, now hand 

 of Pak too 

 - Delhi topgun gives driver death a twist

 Palakkad, Nov. 27: National security adviser M.K. Narayanan has alleged that Pakistan had a hand in the killing of Border Roads Organisation driver Maniappan Raman Kutty by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

 Islamabad does not like the growing friendship and cooperation between India and Afghanistan. But the killing would not deter the country from taking up peace-time construction work in Afghanistan and cementing its friendship with that country, Narayanan told reporters in his hometown Ottapalam, near here, yesterday.

 It was unfortunate that Islamic countries had not condemned the killing by the Taliban, a big menace to the civilised world.

 Narayanans allegation comes in the background of Left Front MPs from Kerala complaining to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that the federal government was slow to act on the hostage release, for the simple reason that the hostage was a mere driver from Kerala.

 Singh had assured the MPs he would make a statement in Parliament on steps taken for Maniappans release.

 Replying to a question on the alleged failure by the government to get the hostage released, Narayanan said the Taliban had not given a chance to negotiate. The rebels made only a phone call saying the hostage would be killed in 48 hours.

 India immediately established contact with the Afghanistan President but the Taliban did not give any further leads to establish contact with it, said Narayanan.

 India is constructing the Zaranj-Delaram highway linking India and Afghanistan, which will bring an annual trade of $100 million for India. The highway, which will also reduce the distance to Iran by over 1,000 km, will provide an alternative and secure route to Iranian ports.

 India is also engaged in construction of the parliament building, the Salma dam, a power distribution network, medical missions, schools and the public transport system in Afghanistan. Some 290 Indians are engaged in the highway project alone.

 The Taliban had kidnapped two Indians in December 2003 but they were released after negotiations.

 The finance manager (technical adviser) of the United Nations Mine Action Centre for Afghanistan, Joseph Paul, who hails from Kerala, had told a Kerala-based TV channel that our government and the mediators failed to convince Maniappans captors that he was only a low-paid employee and not an engineer engaged in the strategic road project. An engineer was a big catch for them.

 Narayanan said there was no change in Indias policy on Iran. We continue our traditional friendship with that country.

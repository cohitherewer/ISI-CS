 Left advises Opp. to fight poll battle, not wrestling bout

 OUR BUREAU

 May 22: Minutes after the ballot battle for control of 79 municipalities across West Bengal drew to a close this afternoon, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas asked the Opposition parties to fight the CPM politically, not wrestle with it. 

 Election is not a wrestling ring. This is a political battle and should be fought politically, he said, holding Congress workers responsible for violence in some parts. 

 Though the polling was largely peaceful, Tarun Kotal, a CPM activist, was killed in Budge Budge, South 24-Parganas and untoward incidents were reported from several other places. 

 Biswass sermon to the Opposition was in response to allegations of unleashing terror made by Pankaj Banerjee, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly and a key Trinamul Congress functionary. 

 Banerjee accused the CPM of rigging the polls either by booth jamming or intimidating voters. We have reports that the cadre, with assistance from policemen on duty, terrorised innocent voters. Let the CPM withdraw policemen from election duty and keep confine them to the barracks, we will show how to tackle them (the cadre), he said today. 

 Re-polling has been ordered in eight booths in North 24-Parganas and one in South, state election commissioner Ajoy Sinha said. 

 Alleged CPM supporters turned out reporters from a polling station in North 24-Pargans Khardah. 

 In ward 14 of Katwa, bombs were hurled outside three booths around the same time during a clash between CPM and Congress supporters, which left seven injured. Seven people were arrested. 

 In Nadia, two boys were arrested from Birnagar for alleged booth-jamming. Around 2.30 pm, six people tried to force their way into a booth at Brahmapur School in Noapara. Police fired three rounds in the air and the intruders were arrested. At Chinsurah in Hooghly, some unused ballot papers were stolen after the voting was completed.

 In north Bengal, the polls were by and large peaceful. However, there was commotion in a booth in Jalpaiguri municipalitys ward 25, where an old man dropped his ballot paper into a post box on the premises. The authorities had to contact the post-office and retrieve the ballot.

 Sinha said around 75 per cent votes were polled across the state. The highest counts were possibly at Joynagar in South 24-Parganas and Mirik in Darjeeling where over 90 per cent votes were polled.

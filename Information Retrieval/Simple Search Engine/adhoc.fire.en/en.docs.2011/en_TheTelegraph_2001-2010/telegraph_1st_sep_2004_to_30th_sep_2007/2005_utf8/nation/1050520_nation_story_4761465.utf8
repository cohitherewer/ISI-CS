 Friend France jogs memory

 New Delhi, May 19: After bus diplomacy, its time for Airbus diplomacy.

 Amid its disappointment at Air-Indias preference for the American Boeing over the European Airbus, France has subtly reminded India that it was one of the first to back Delhis demand for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

 The French move comes at a time when the US is undecided on whether to support the Indian bid.

 France and the US are vying for contracts for the 126 fighter aircraft India would soon be buying. The Americans are lobbying hard for India to buy their F-16 and F-18 fighters while the French are looking to sell Mirage 2000s. 

 France was the first permanent member country of the Security Council to have publicly supported Indias candidature for permanent membership of an enlarged UNSC, said a French government statement issued two days ago.

 It isnt clear whether this was officially communicated to South Block, but the French embassy in Delhi circulated copies of the statement among the media.

 The support spans over more than 10 years, reiterated by President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin and successive ministers for foreign affairs, Dominique de Villepin and Michel Barnier, in several international fora as well as during their visits to India, the statement said.

 The US has made it clear that so far it has decided to support only Japan among the Group of Four nations for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and not the other three ? India, Germany and Brazil.

 France has not said anything on whether, unlike the other permanent members of the Security Council, it wants the additional members to have veto powers.

 India and most of the other hopefuls are reconciled to getting into the Security Council without veto power. Officially, however, Delhi still maintains that it will continue to lobby for veto power. The French governments statement at this juncture, therefore, has special significance.

 Earlier this month, the first strains in Indo-French ties surfaced when Air-India awarded a contract for 50 aircraft to Boeing instead of Airbus. A disappointed French ambassador in Delhi reacted by saying that some factor other than commercial had played a role in the deal.

 Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran frowned on the remarks, telling Dominique Girard they were not in keeping with diplomatic propriety.

 Left takes up cudgels for legislature

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 11: The CPM today took the lead in pressing for a presidential reference on Jharkhand as the Congress seemed keen to avoid a direct confrontation with the judiciary.

 CPM members in the Lok Sabha joined issue with the NDA, which raised the matter during zero hour. Left members argued it was a state controversy and should not be discussed in a national forum like Parliament.

 Outside the House, party MP Nilotpal Basu said: ?There should be a public debate on the separation of powers of different state organs. This is the right time to go for a presidential reference on the issue.?

 But the Congress did not seem keen to take on the judiciary either as a party or government. Union law minister H.R. Bharadwaj informally told the media the legislature cannot ?disobey? the judiciary.

 But Basu insisted there should be a clear demarcation of powers of state institutions. ?Who is to convene Parliament or the Assembly? Will it be the custodian of the House or the Supreme Court??

 ?Who will decide the timings of the session?? asked Roopchand Pal, a CPM MP, at a news conference. The court was transgressing the powers of the legislature, he said.

 The Left has always been sceptical of judicial activism. In the past, they have criticised the Supreme Court order vacating all polluting industries from Delhi?s residential areas. But they welcomed the court?s strictures against the Narendra Modi government for not conducting a fair trial of the Godhra riots cases. 

 CPM leaders, however, said: ?We do not agree with the Jharkhand governor?s actions. But we are now referring to larger constitutional issues.?

 The leader of the Lok Sabha, Pranab Mukherjee, countered the NDA?s charge that the Prime Minister and senior Congress leaders were instigating Jharkhand developments. ?The UPA government has nothing to do with Jharkhand developments. Neither the Prime Minister, the home minister nor the Congress chief has anything to do with it.?

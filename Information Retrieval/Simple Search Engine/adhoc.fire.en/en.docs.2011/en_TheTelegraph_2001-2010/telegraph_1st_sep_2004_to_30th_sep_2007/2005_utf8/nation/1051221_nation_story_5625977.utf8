 Lalu nephew arrested

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 20: Lalu Prasads nephew Nagendra Rai, who is facing charges of assault and extortion, has been arrested.

 Patna senior superintendent of police Kundan Krishnan said Rai was arrested late last night and taken to the Secretariat police station. He was remanded in judicial custody till January 3 and sent to Beur central jail today. 

 Rai, who had become a law unto himself, faces at least three cases relating to extortion, intimidation, assault and firing.

 The local strongman, however, feigned ignorance about the cases in which he was being booked. 

 One of my friends called me to inform last night that the local inspector was looking for me. I went home and I was arrested. I have not eaten anything, he said with defiance.

 Known for his high-handed ways, Rai had emerged as the biggest donation collector from shopkeepers and traders in the entire stretch west of the citys zoo on Bailey Road.

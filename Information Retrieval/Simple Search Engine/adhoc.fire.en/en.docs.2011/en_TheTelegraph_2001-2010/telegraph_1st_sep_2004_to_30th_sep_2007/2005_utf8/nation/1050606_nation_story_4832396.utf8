 Mulayam foray in south

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, June 5: The Samajwadi Party opened its account in the south with the partys Karnataka president, Sarekoppa Bangarappa, today winning the Lok Sabha bypoll from Shimoga while the Janata Dal (Secular) wrested the Chamarajpet Assembly constituency in Bangalore city.

 The victories over the Congress will change political equations and increase the friction within the Congress-Janata Dal (S) coalition government of chief minister Dharam Singh.

 The 73-year-old Bangarappa proved he was invincible in Shimoga, defeating Ayanur Manjunath of the Congress by 16,637 votes. The former chief minister pulled off a hat-trick, winning as a Congress candidate in 1999, as a BJP candidate in 2004 and on a Samajwadi ticket in this bypoll caused by his resignation from the BJP and the Lok Sabha earlier this year.

 We have made a good beginning in the south. People here acknowledge my contribution to the state as chief minister and to Shimoga as a member of Parliament. They are aware of my years of service to the constituency, be it a railway line, hospitals, schools, jobs or community development, Bangarappa said soon after being elected.

 We (Samajawadi Party) will revive the third front with support from the Left. We will try to wrest power from the Congress-Janata Dal coalition.

 In Bangalore, Zameer Ahmed Khan of the Janata Dal (S) wrested the Chamarajpet Assembly seat by defeating former Congress legislator R.V. Devaraj by 3,678 votes. The seat was vacated by former chief minister S.M. Krishna after being appointed Maharashtra governor. Last year, the Janata Dal (S) had lost all eight Assembly seats in Bangalore.

 The BJP finished a poor third in both seats. 

 Dharam Singh of the Congress said the party accepts the verdict of the electorate but the results will not have any impact on the ruling coalition. It is up to the high command to decide whether or not to change the state Congress committee leader (Janardhan Poojary).

 However, some of his senior cabinet colleagues rue the growth of Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (S) in Karnataka. Our partys base will wither and Deve Gowda will take complete control of the government, one of them said.

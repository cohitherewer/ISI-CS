 Ahead: 42-flight week

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: Indian and Chinese airlines can fly up to 42 flights a week to either country by next year.

 In a landmark aviation pact signed here today, the two Asian neighbours agreed to allow up to 14 additional flights a week from this summer from each side, which would go up to 28 flights a week this winter and stabilise at 42 flights a week in summer 2006.

 The pact says both countries can designate one or more state-run or privately-owned airlines to operate on specified routes.

 The airlines designated by India shall be entitled to operate scheduled air services in both directions from any point in India to any three intermediate points and on to any six points in China at its discretion. These flights may go on to any three points beyond, with the restriction that only two of those airports would be in one country. Chinese airlines will enjoy similar rights.

 Cargo services of designated airlines of both countries will be entitled to fly in from any other nation to either of the two nations and then fly on to any place of their choice with unlimited capacity entitlements.

 Officials said charter operations between the two countries would be governed by the charter regulations of the respective countries.

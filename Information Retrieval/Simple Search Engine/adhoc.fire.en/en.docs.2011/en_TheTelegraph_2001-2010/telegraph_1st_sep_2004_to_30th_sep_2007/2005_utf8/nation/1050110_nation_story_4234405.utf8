 Port Blair, Jan. 9: In its 25 years, the INS Rajput has never seen any real action. Unless you count saving over 1,100 lives in the past 10 days. 

 On this destroyer, two Brahmos missiles have had to sit patiently beside crates of rice and dal, helicopters have been happily pushed aside to give just a few more a smooth place to rest their weary heads on, after being evacuated by the crew from tsunami-ravaged islands. 

 ?At the risk of sounding immodest, I?ll say we did okay,? said Captain A.S. Aiyappa, aboard his ship docked at the Naval Wharf in Port Blair. The mammoth vessel, with anti-aircraft, anti-surface and anti-submarine capability, left its dock at Visakhapatnam for safer open waters when after the earthquake on December 26. The captain then was given orders to head towards Port Blair, before being diverted to Hut Bay instead. 

 Aiyappa and his 280 men got to work on December 28, rescuing 310 people using the three small boats on board. ?It took some time, as each boat can carry only seven to eight people,? he explained. With no jetty and no breakwater, the ship was anchored a fair distance away from the shore. Soft land to beach the boats was found, from where they ferried passengers to the Kashin-class destroyer. 

 ?Our primary concern was the safety of the people we were evacuating and then the safety of the boats.? 

 The Rajput then headed towards Car Nicobar, where there was another rescue ship in distress carrying evacuated islanders, which it towed to the safety of Port Blair. 

 On arrival, the mariners loaded up fresh relief material as well as two teams of doctors from Calcutta and Bangalore . The next destination was the Nancowrie group of islands on December 30, where an aerial recce was carried out before relief supplies and satellite phones were dropped off. Large stores were also deposited in Camorta, from where inter-island ferries ply. 

 The next day, the sailors headed south towards the Nicobar group. Anchored just off Campbell Bay over four days, the team evacuated another 810 people. The Chetak helicopter was used to move 170 people to safety, which saw Lt Com. Amitabh Bisht flying five hours straight and landing over 25 times. After providing security cover for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s visit on Saturday, they headed for the capital once more. 

 This evening, furious restocking was going on as the men await orders for where to sail next. 

 After a quarter century of waiting in Indian waters, the INS Rajput has found its purpose.

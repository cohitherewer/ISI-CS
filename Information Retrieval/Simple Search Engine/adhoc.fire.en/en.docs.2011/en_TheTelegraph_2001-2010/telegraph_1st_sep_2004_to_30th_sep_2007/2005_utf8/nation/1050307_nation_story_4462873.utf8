 Patro?s power pangs 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 6: Orissa energy minister Suryo Narayan Patro has come in for flak over the government?s ?failure? to properly implement the rural electrification programme.

 Patro recently faced the wrath of both the Opposition and treasury bench members in the Assembly and none of the minister?s party colleagues came to his rescue. 

 Speaker Maheswar Mohanty too said Patro was not giving appropriate replies to the members? queries.

 Intervening in the discussion, Leader of Opposition J.B. Patnaik demanded that a white paper containing details of funding, expenditure and exact position of the rural electrification projects be laid on the table of the House. 

 Responding to his demand, Mohanty directed the minister to present the white paper in the House prior to discussions on the budgetary demand of grants relating to the energy department.

 A cornered Patro, while replying to a query by member Duryodhan Majhi, said only 2,571 villages have been electrified in the past five years. Of these, 1,073 have been covered under the rural electrification programme, 438 under the Pradhan Mantri Gramodyog Yojana and another 1,060 under the minimum-needs programme. 

 The minister assured the House that all villages in the state would receive electricity by 2009.

 He said the government had decided to electrify 4,646 villages during 2002-03 and 2003-04. Of the targeted 1,253 villages, the Central Electricity Supply Company had completed the electrification of only 182 villages. On the other hand, the Northern Electricity Supply Company covered 305 of the targeted 916 villages.

 In western Orissa, 199 of the targeted 965 villages were covered while 374 of the 1,512 villages were electrified in the south.

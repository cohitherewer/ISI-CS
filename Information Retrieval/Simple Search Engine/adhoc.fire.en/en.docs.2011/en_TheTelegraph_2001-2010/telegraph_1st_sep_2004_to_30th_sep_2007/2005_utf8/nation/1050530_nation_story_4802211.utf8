 HC bars gender bias in pay 

 New Delhi, May 29 (PTI): Delhi High Court has held that the gender of an employee cannot be a factor in determining the pay scale if both male and female workers are performing similar tasks under different designations. 

 Designation would be immaterial and irrelevant if it is proved that both (male and female) the categories are doing the same or similar work, said the bench of Justices M.K. Sharma and Rekha Sharma, who dismissed an appeal filed by Super Bazar Cooperative Stores Ltd. 

 The bench said it found justification in the findings of the court that there may be some discrimination on certain well-defined principles, but in the matter of pay scales, there cannot be any inequality or discrimination only on the ground of sex. 

 The court had quashed the order of the appellate authority justifying higher salary for male staff saying it had placed emphasis only on one factor ? the designation.

 Female workers appointed on a regular basis as packers along with their male counterparts at the Super Bazar in 1984, had pointed to a discrimination in pay, though they were doing similar work. 

 The court said though the female workers were regularised with the designation of packing cleaners and their male counterpart as packers, it has been established that they were performing almost the same or similar kind of work.

 The single judge, on consideration of the evidence on record and also on appreciation of the findings recorded by the appellate authority, found that nature of the work performed by the female workers was similar to that of their male counterparts, the bench said. The judge held that designation cannot be the determining factor for fixing the pay scales if the nature of the work is the same, which is more important than the designation, the court said. 

 Ashok Aggarwal, the counsel for the female workers, had contended that the pay discrimination was in violation of the provisions of the Equal Remuneration Act. Pointing to Section 4 of the act, which places a duty upon the employer to pay equal remuneration to men and women for same work or work of a similar nature, the court also referred to an international convention.

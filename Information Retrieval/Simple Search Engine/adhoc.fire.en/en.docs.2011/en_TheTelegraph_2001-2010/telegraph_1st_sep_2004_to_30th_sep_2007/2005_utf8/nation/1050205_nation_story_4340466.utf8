 Cautious Delhi waits amp; watches

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: The Indian military establishment is expecting a renewed offensive by the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) against Leftist rebels because the emergency imposed by King Gyanendra will release troops from guard duty of static installations.

 A total clampdown on communications has made it difficult for the Opposition and the rebels to organise and mobilise protests, making Kathmandu easier to police. With the police moving in and doing tasks in which troops have been bogged down, the RNA is expected to become more mobile, military sources here assess.

 In its nine-year fight against the Maoist rebels, the RNA has been consistently supported by the Indian Army with training and weapons, often sold at a fraction of the cost. But now Gyanendra?s palace putsch earlier this week has strained relations between Kathmandu and New Delhi to such an extent that the Indian Army chief?s ceremonial takeover as the honorary chief of the RNA has been put on hold.

 But the Indian military establishment is advising against driving too hard against the king because of the China fear factor. Since the renewal of official diplomatic communication with Kathmandu last evening, New Delhi can be expected to be more wary of being overtly critical of the king.

 A source in the military establishment pointed out that the chief of the RNA, General Pyar Jung Thapa, had visited Beijing in June last year. Though there was no publicity given to the nature of the talks he had held, the RNA chief had said that he had met the Chinese defence minister General Cao Gangchuan and the chief of China?s Peoples? Liberation Army, General Liang Guangli.

 The RNA chief said China was committed to increase security cooperation with Nepal and give it military support in the fight against the rebels.

 The Chinese news agency, Xinhua, today quoted the spokesperson of the foreign ministry in Beijing as having objected to the term ?Maoist? to describe Nepal?s Leftist rebels. China has also said the resolution of its political crisis was an internal affair of Nepal. 

 Neither Kathmandu nor Beijing publicises the nature of military contacts they have established.

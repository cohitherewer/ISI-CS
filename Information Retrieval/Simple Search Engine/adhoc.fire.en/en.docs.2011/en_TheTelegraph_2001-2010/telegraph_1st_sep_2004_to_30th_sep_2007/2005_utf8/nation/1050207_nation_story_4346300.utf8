 Tied to a baby and a traumatic past

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Arpit?s mother believes Savitri Minz was good to the baby but his father wants punishment for the maid who has pleaded emotional attachment.

 Savitri, who was flown here from Orissa this morning by police, regretted her action but said she was helpless. ?I wanted to go home. There was no one I could leave Arpit with. So I took him with me.?

 Savitri, around 20, had disappeared with Rs 200 and the 18-month-old son of Arvind and Bharti Dewan of south Delhi?s Srinivaspuri less than a week after they had hired her at Vineet Placement Agency.

 Arvind, employed with a multinational firm, and Bharti, working for an NGO based in Chittaranjan Park, were away from home when the incident happened on January 31. They had not checked up on Savitri with her previous employer.

 Delhi police said Savitri came from ?a disturbed? background that made her incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong. They added that she might have taken the child with her as she had developed an ?emotional attachment to him?.

 Arvind had told the police that the maid had become very attached to the child in the short time she worked in his house.

 ?However, we are not ruling out the possibility that others may be involved in the abduction,? said Praveer Ranjan, deputy commissioner of police (south district).

 Savitri has been charged with kidnapping. Her interrogation will continue, Ranjan said.

 Delhi police ? which had set up 40 teams in search of the child ? took custody of the maid in Orissa after the state police found her last morning acting suspiciously at the Rajganjpur bus stand in her native Sundergarh district.

 Police inquiries have found that she was also attached to her previous employer?s child. They further told the police that Savitri was unhappy after a recent break-up with a boyfriend, who was a security guard, and had quit her job suddenly.

 The police have figured out from her unposted letters ? some of them written in Oriya to a family member who is like a brother ? that she was forced to leave ?home? over a love affair and wanted to commit suicide.

 Arvind and Bharti had hired Savitri to fill in for their regular domestic help who had gone on leave. The maid, the police said, may have decided to vanish with the toddler as she was afraid of losing touch with him once her short stint got over.

 Arvind, unrelenting after the harrowing experience of losing his child for a week, said: ?She has put us through a lot. She should be punished.?

 Bharti, happy at being reunited with her son on a day which is also her birthday, said: ?Savitri has taken good care of him. Though he does look thinner than before.?

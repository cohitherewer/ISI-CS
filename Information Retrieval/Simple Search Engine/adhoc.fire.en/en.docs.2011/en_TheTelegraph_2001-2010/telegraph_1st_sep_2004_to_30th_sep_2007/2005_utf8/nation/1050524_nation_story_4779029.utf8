 Antony picked for RS seat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 23: Former Kerala chief minister A.K. Antony bounced back in the reckoning as Sonia Gandhi tonight nominated him as party candidate for a vacant Rajya Sabha seat from Kerala.

 The Congress president had rejected all six names recommended by state chief minister Oomen Chandy and the state Congress leadership. The state leadership had recommended, among others, the names of former Union minister K.P. Unnikrishnan, former Lok Sabha member P.C. Chacko, Shivkumar and T. Basheer.

 Tomorrow is the last day for filing nominations for the June 3 elections.

 The vacancy arose in the wake of veteran state leader K. Karunanidhis resignation from the Rajya Sabha after he floated the breakaway Congress party earlier this month.

 Antony was removed as chief minister last September after the partys disastrous performance in the last Lok Sabha elections.

 Antonys nomination has triggered speculation in the party that he might be included in the central ministry when it is expanded sometime before the monsoon session of Parliament in mid July.

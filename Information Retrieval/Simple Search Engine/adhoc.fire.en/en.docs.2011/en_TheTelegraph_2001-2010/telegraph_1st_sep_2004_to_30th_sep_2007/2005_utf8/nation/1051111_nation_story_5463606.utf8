 Six months, right to call Natwar for inquiry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Natwar 

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The Union cabinet today cleared the constitution of an inquiry authority under Justice R.S. Pathak to probe the Volcker committee allegations against Natwar Singh, the Congress and several other Indian entities.

 The Justice R.S. Pathak inquiry authority, though officially not a commission of inquiry, will have all the powers of one. It has been set up under the Commission of Inquiry Act, will have the power to summon witnesses and its report ? to be submitted in six months ? will be tabled in Parliament.

 The learned judge agreed that we give him time of six months. We are going on the advice of the law ministry and the learned judge, finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters after the days first cabinet meeting, which approved the formation of the probe panel. 

 (The) authority will be clothed with all statutory powers as desired by the authority itself.

 As the cabinet meeting had to be curtailed because ministers had to attend the cremation of former President K.R. Narayanan, a second cabinet meeting was held later in the night. It decided that the Pathak probe panel will have all special statutory powers under section 2 of the Commission of Inquiry Act. It will probe all entities and individuals named in the Volcker report looking into kickbacks paid under Iraqs oil-for-food programme.

 The full terms of reference of the inquiry are likely to be spelt out in a day or two.

 Asked why an authority was set up instead of a commission, Chidambaram had earlier said: There is no difference in terms of the objectives to be achieved; there is no difference in the effectiveness of the inquiry and there is no difference in the powers required to inquire into the matter. He said the Commission of Inquiry Act provides for such an authority.

 Asked whether Natwar ? now a minister without portfolio ? was present at the cabinet meeting, Chidambaram said he was but left when the matter of setting up the authority was taken up for discussion.

 Chidambaram denied any delay by the Centre in setting up the probe panel, saying Justice Pathak had sent his concurrence on November 7, following which the Prime Minister had issued orders. The cabinet met today. There was no delay.

 An official note was released stating the authority would seek to establish the truth (or otherwise) of the unverified allegations in the report against certain Indian entities and individuals and will be a single-judge body.

 The finance minister indicated that the possibility of tax violations by the 125 Indian companies that figure in the Volcker report could be investigated.

 Asked if the central board of direct taxes would look into their tax records, he said: Not to my knowledge. It (the scrutiny of tax returns by these companies) has not happened till now. But I am not saying it will not happen.

 Such a probe is expected to be independent of the judicial inquiry Justice Pathak will carry out.

 Among the companies said to be mentioned in the report are the State Trading Corporation, Kirloskar Engines, Ajanta Pharma and Mohan Exports. These are among 2,400 firms worldwide that allegedly made illegal payments worth $1.8 billion to the Saddam regime.

 Natwar has denied the charge of being a non-contractual beneficiary of the oil programme.

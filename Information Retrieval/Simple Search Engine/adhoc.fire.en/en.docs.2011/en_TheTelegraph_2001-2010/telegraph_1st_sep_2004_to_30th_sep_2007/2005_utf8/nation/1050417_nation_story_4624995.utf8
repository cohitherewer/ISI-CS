 Hyderabad, April 16: Sherwanis for the President, bangles for the begum.

 Peace lovers from Hyderabad have readied two sherwanis for Pervez Musharraf which will be gifted to the Pakistan President in Delhi tomorrow.

 The architect of the initiative is Maulana Peerzade Syed Shabbir Nakshabandi, who heads a minority organisation in the national capital.

 A Hyderabadi, the maulana has raised funds from the city?s leaders to stitch the two sherwanis in cream and black. They were made by the well-known Mukhdoom brothers, tailors of the nizam and other nobles of the former kingdom.

 Faiz Mohiuddin Mukhdoom, the master tailor, said the fabric they used was Japanese polyester cotton. ?We have used jardosi borders and Swarovski crystals,? said the man who was official tailor for former President S.D. Sharma.

 The peace lovers have also readied four pairs of bangles made of lac. ?They are our gifts for Begum (Sehba) Musharraf . We were told that during her last visit to India, she had made enquiries about the bangles made at Lad Bazar near Charminar,? said the maulana. Sameera Rahman, Faiz?s sister, chose the bangles.

 Musharraf?s visit dominated sermons at most congregations. Special prayers were held at the Mecca mosque and sixty other places today.

 The last time Musharraf came to India, the maulana said, he did not visit Ajmer before the talks with the leadership. This time he began with a prayer at the dargah of Moinuddin Chishti. Hopefully, the talks will succeed, he added.

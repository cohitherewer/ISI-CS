 Holes picked in harmony bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: Civil rights activists and NGOs have criticised the communal violence (prevention and rehabilitation of victims) bill as flawed.

 The government did not consult civil society groups or attempt to forge a national consensus on a bill of such magnitude, an activist said.

 They are planning to move amendments to the bill pending before a parliamentary standing committee.

 The need for a communal harmony bill was accentuated after the 2002 Gujarat riots. The ruling UPAs common minimum programme has promised to pass it. 

 Critics said one of the main drawbacks is that the bill fails to strengthen the rights of citizens. Instead of strengthening the hand of citizens, the bill further strengthens the hand of the state governments, one said.

 The problem with Gujarat in 2002, Delhi in 1984, Bhagalpur in 1989 or Mumbai in 1993 was not that the state lacked the powers to act but that it lacked the will to act or worse, that it willed the communal violence to continue, an activist said.

 The activists claimed the bill did not have enough checks and balances for the state. Although the Centre could intervene if a state failed to control communal violence, it could not summon armed forces without the states consent.

 This itself is contradictory. How can the Centre then enforce law and order? asked Kamal Mitra Chenoy, a JNU professor.

 The bill provides for punishment to government officials who fail to do their duty during communal violence. But again, prosecution would require the states consent. There was also a lack of clarity on gender violence.

 The activists, however, conceded that the bill was better than the first draft.

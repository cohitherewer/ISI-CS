 Peace pipeline meet

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Feb. 21: Indian and Pakistani ministers are set to meet on March 15 and 16 to discuss the transnational gas pipeline project from Iran.

 The meeting is expected to take place on the margins of a conference of Saarc energy ministers.

 Pakistan?s petroleum minister Amanullah Jadoon told The Telegraph that an invitation has been extended to his Indian counterpart Mani Shankar Aiyar. ?The talks with Aiyar will be held in mid-March and there is a standing invitation to him to these discussions,? Jadoon said.

 A day before his departure to Iran with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, Jadoon said Tehran and Islamabad have decided to go ahead with the project. ?India is welcome if it joins us,? the minister said. 

 Last week, when foreign minister K. Natwar Singh was in Pakistan, India had agreed to consider joining the project, labelled the peace pipeline. 

 Experts have been expressing apprehension about possible US opposition to the pipeline because of the row over Tehran?s nuclear programme. But Jadoon said he did not foresee any such opposition.

 Iran push in Delhi

 The pipeline figured in talks between Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi and the Indian leadership, reports our special correspondent in New Delhi.

 ?The Indian government has created an encouraging atmosphere for pushing ahead with this highly important project which, no doubt, would have a positive impact on regional convergence,? the visiting foreign minister told a meeting in the capital.

 ?We expect the project to take off soon,? Kharrazi, who met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as well as Natwar Singh, said.

 Targeted by the US, Iran wants New Delhi to use its influence among the develop- ing countries to allow Tehran to pursue its atomic programme for ?peaceful? purposes.

 Kharrazi feels that at the review of the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty, scheduled for later this year, Iran and North Korea are likely to come under attack by the US-led bloc for their alleged violation of the treaty. 

 Iran would like to get India?s support ? though Delhi is neither a signatory to the NPT nor an observer at the review meeting ? to convince the developing world to rally behind Tehran.

 Atal replies with Ram

 Pune, April 14 (Agencies): Ram on his lips, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has regained the voice that had silenced many an adversary when he was in power.

 ?I do not fear death, but I fear getting a bad name,? Vajpayee said this evening, quoting a couplet from the Ramayana at a golden jubilee celebration where the recent outburst against him by RSS leader K.S. Sudarshan hung heavy.

 Without referring to either Sudarshan or to his attack, a vintage Vajpayee used the celebration of 50 years of Geet Ramayan, a poetic composition of the epic, to express his unhappiness at the unbridled criticism.

 ?We are living in such times that it is difficult to avoid being maligned. If Lord Ram had taken birth in these times, he, too, would not have escaped being maligned.?

 Before Vajpayee left Delhi for Pune, BJP president L.K. Advani met the former Prime Minister at his residence and is understood to have discussed the RSS chief?s attack.

 At the meeting, the former Prime Minister quoted liberally from the Ramayana, saying the epic has enough episodes from which one can learn about ?patience and determination?.

 Vajpayee recalled that when an exasperated Sita asked Lord Ram when the vanvas would end, he said: ?divas jaat nahin der lagti (time flies without our knowledge).

 One should learn to be patient and never get overwhelmed by a sense of disappointment, Vajpayee explained.

 Suggesting that a bloated ego leads one nowhere, he said: ?We are all made of mud and in one rain would be washed away.?

 The former Prime Minister said though he was known to react late (a possible reference to pot shots that he used to pause and ponder too long at the fag end of his tenure), when Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar called him to today?s programme, he did not waste time in accepting the invitation. 

 But one familiar feature, which also came to the fore in the run-up to the Lok Sabha election, did not change. Vajpayee today repeatedly referred to Sharad Pawar as Sharad Chandra Rao.

 Sensing something amiss, he asked the audience if had he committed any ?gadbad? (faux pas).

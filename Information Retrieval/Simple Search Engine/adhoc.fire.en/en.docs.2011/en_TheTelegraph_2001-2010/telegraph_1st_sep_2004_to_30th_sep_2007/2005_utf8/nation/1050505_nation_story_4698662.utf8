 IAF fight over Anjali food

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Anjali Gupta

 Bangalore, May 4: The sexual harassment trial in the Indian Air Force has turned into a bitter brawl with sparks flying over as basic a matter as what the accuser should be fed in custody.

 The absence of Flying Officer Anjali Gupta, who has accused three senior officers of harassing her, at the general court martial prompted adjournment of the proceedings today but not before the prosecution accused her of feigning illness.

 The court martial is being held on charges of indiscipline and financial irregularities.

 Citing indisposition, the flying officer also abstained from a court of inquiry set up to probe her charges of sexual harassment against the three officers.

 The court of inquiry, headed by Air Vice-Marshal V.R. Iyer, sought her presence to record evidence against the three officers named in her complaint to the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi. 

 The general court martial issued instructions for Gupta?s medical examination at Air Force Command Hospital here.

 On the question of her fitness, the prosecution, represented by Wing Commander R.D. Dubey, claimed that Gupta was feigning illness to evade the court martial proceedings. She was insisting on mango juice instead of her regular food, he said.

 The court martial rejected Gupta?s plea, submitted through her defending officer Wing Commander Vijay Bhupesh, for food of her choice.

 In her written application, she requested to be served porridge, khichdi, curd and idlis instead of oily dishes (puri and sabzi) on the ASTE campus. But the presiding officer, Group Captain V. Ganesh, rejected the application, saying she cannot move such a plea in absentia.

 Outside the court hall, Uma Gupta, the flying officer?s mother, alleged that Gupta was refused warm water and lime juice.

 ?When she cannot stand up, why are they putting pressure on her? They are not giving her calorific food. I have left my ailing husband at home (in Delhi) and am here to give my child moral support. They are not letting me meet her for more than two hours,? she told reporters.

 Scorpene seal at Paris meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Indian Navy will import two Scorpene submarines from France and co-produce four after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh puts his seal of approval on the deal during his visit to Paris on September 11.

 Details on the schedule of deliveries and the final price were not being disclosed by officials ostensibly on an issue of protocol since the Prime Ministers office was expected to make the announcement from Paris. Speculation on the size of the deal ranges from $1.8 billion to 2.4 billion euros.

 This would be the first big-ticket defence procurement by the UPA government since it came to power last year.

 The navy was looking at two versions of the Scorpene ? one with AIP and the other without. The AIP is a chamber of locked air, which would allow the submarine to stay underwater for longer hours. The navy is understood to have finally favoured the version without AIP.

 Negotiations for the SSK class 1,500-tonne submarines, continuing for the last decade, were deadlocked on the issue of price escalation till the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) is understood to have okayed it this week.

 The CCSs decision to go ahead with the deal despite intense lobbying by the German makers of the HDW submarines was taken as the navy insisted. Successive navy chiefs have pointed out to the government that the submarine fleet was steadily depleting.

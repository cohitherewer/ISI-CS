 Oscar burden on Terrorist

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 27: The verdict will be out by the time you read this, but on Oscar eve, all Indian hopes are pinned on Ashvin Kumar?s Little Terrorist. 

 The 12-minute film, on a little boy who strays into Indian territory unknowingly chasing while playing cricket, has lapped a nomination in the best Short Film (Live Action) category. It is the story of the boy?s short stay in the ?enemy land?, and how he returns to his homeland helped by a father and daughter. 

 In the background of the two countries? not so friendly politics, despite what is being said on paper, especially when it comes to ordinary people who cross the border without keeping in mind the national boundaries, the slickly-made film becomes a sharp comment on the absurdity of lines of control, actual or otherwise, when it comes to the daily lives of people across the border. 

 Though criticised in some quarters, if gently, as having been made with an eye on the Oscars and the festival circuit, the film has received rave reviews for the splendid acting and the utter believability of the characters. 

 Its director Ashvin is in Los Angeles now, gearing up for the ceremony, neck-deep in rehearsals, Q amp;A sessions and meeting the press. He says he feels numb under the pressure, but will find some time to pick up his mother, designer Ritu Kumar. He says he will be wearing a bandhgala and will be seated beside his fiancee at the ceremony.

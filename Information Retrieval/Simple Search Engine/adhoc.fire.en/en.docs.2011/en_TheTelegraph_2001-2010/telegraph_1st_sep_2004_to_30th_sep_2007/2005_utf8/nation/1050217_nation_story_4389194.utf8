 Clerics switch loyalties

 FARHANA KALAM

 Patna/Gaya, Feb. 16: Clerics in Bihar have mastered the art of doing political ?somersaults?.

 After observing Muslim clerics shuttle between the Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan camps, political activist A.M. Karimi feels that politicians are not the only ones who indulge in ?hopping? during elections.

 While several clerics switched sides during the campaign period, the most glaring example was that of Maulana Syed Ahmed Raza, president of the All-Bihar Ulema Council.

 A few days ago, he targeted the Rabri Devi government through a front-page advertisement in Qaumi Tanzeem, the leading Urdu daily published from Patna. The advertisement carried a 11-point chargesheet against the government and accused the Rashtriya Janata Dal of causing immense damage to Muslims in the past 15 years.

 The charges levelled by the ulema council chief included the conversion of a five-acre plot of prime land, which belonged to Madrasa Shamsul Hoda, into a khatal and the government?s failure to remove the encroachment despite the high court?s directives to that effect. Most of the charges pertained to the alleged misappropriation and wrongful possession of real estate belonging to Muslim trusts. 

 The maulana had appealed to Muslim voters to support the Lok Janshakti Party as the RJD had taken them for a ride.

 However, Maulana Ahmed Raza did a somersault in less than three days and issued an appeal through the same newspaper to support Laloo Prasad Yadav, as, the threat of ?communal and fascist forces was very real? and the RJD chief had been at the forefront of the fight against communalism.

 Justifying the sudden change of opinion, the maulana said he had nothing personal against anybody and the charges levelled against the RJD were ?explanatory? in nature. Laloo Prasad has promised to address the issues raised by the council after the elections, he reasoned.

 Maulana Raza emphasised that ?the interests of the community were supreme? and as such he changed his mind in favour of Laloo Prasad.

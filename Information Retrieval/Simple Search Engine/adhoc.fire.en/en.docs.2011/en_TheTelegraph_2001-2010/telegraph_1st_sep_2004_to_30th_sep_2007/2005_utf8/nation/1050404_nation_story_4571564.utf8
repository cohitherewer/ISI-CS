 Paswan stalls Nitish

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 3: Ram Vilas Paswan today poured cold water on Nitish Kumar?s initiative to form a government in Bihar, saying he is going with the popular mood that seems to support continuation of President?s rule for some months.

 ?I have not even seen the letter sent by Nitish Kumar and I feel there is no need to do so. All that I wanted to know is whether the Janata Dal (United) has snapped its ties with the BJP and it has not. There is no change or flexibility in my stand. I will have nothing to do with the BJP and I want a Muslim to become chief minister,? the Lok Janshakti Party president said today.

 Nitish had yesterday sent the letter to six political parties and 17 Independents, inviting them to join the effort to form a government on the basis of a ?common minimum programme? for the development of Bihar.

 ?Our manifesto is better than their common minimum programme,? Paswan said today.

 Rumours were in the air after Nitish met Paswan yesterday at the residence of state Samajwadi Party president Dadan Pehalwan, who said there was a positive movement for installing a government in the state.

 The Dal(U) had dropped hints that it was not ready to snap ties with the BJP and, in fact, contemplating seeking outside support from its alliance partner in case the other parties were willing. Nitish had met BJP chief L.K. Advani last night.

 Nitish had written to the CPI, CPI-ML, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Nationalist Congress Party, LJP and the 17 Independents.

 The CPI-ML and the BSP have since clarified that they are not part of any such endeavour. With Paswan clarifying his position today, the latest effort at government-formation has died a premature death.

 Dal(U) leaders said they had expected such a response from Paswan. ?We made an effort yesterday to convey that we were not sitting idle. We will wait for another opportune moment to renew our efforts,? a party leader said.

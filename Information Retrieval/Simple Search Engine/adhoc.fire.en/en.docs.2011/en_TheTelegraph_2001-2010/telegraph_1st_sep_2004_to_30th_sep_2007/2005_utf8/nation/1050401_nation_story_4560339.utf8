 Army promises security

 New Delhi, March 31: The army is deploying troops to ?sanitise? the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road for the bus service, scheduled to begin from April 7, following threats by militants, reports our special correspondent. 

 The army chief, General J.J. Singh, today said ?whatever is possible? was being done to ensure passengers? safety. 

 The service would be popular among the people of Kashmir who would not cooperate with the rebels, Singh hoped. The threat to disrupt it ?is a desperate and anti-people act. The terrorists issued threats during elections also?, he said.

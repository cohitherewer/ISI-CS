 Surat steals Antwerp 

dazzle

 Sparling baubles 

London, April 4 (PTI): The centre of diamond processing has shifted from the Belgian city of Antwerp to Surat in Gujarat, according to a media report.

 The Flemish weekly Knack said Surat employs about 750,000 to one million cutters and polishers, who process rough diamonds ?in sometimes shocking conditions for an average wage of 100 euros per month?.

 Antwerp once employed tens of thousands of diamond processors. This number has been reduced to 1,500, distributed across small companies.

 About 400 Indian merchants, mainly from Gujarat, are engaged in the diamond trade in Antwerp.

 Last year, India exported processed diamonds worth 7 billion euros, which represents 90 per cent of the global production. The export to India from Belgium in 2004 increased 20 per cent.

 ?This is a very significant development,? Peter Meeus, managing director of the Hoge Raad Voor Diamant (diamond council) told the weekly.

 ?It underlines the position of India as both a diamond market and an industrial centre. India is developing into one of the largest jewel and diamond markets in the world,? he said.

 For now, Antwerp remains the undisputed Mecca of the diamond trade. But that position is under threat.

 Dubai has ambitions to become the leading diamond trading centre. The government is building an imposing skyscraper specifically for this purpose, with offices for diamond traders, who will not have to pay tax for a period of 50 years.

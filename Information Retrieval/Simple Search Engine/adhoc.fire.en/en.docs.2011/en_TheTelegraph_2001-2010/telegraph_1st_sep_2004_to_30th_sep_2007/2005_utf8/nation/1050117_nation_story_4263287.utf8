The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Friendly fight ?claims? Cong 4

 OUR BUREAU

 Patna/Gaya, Jan. 16: Treading with caution over having a ?friendly contest? with the Rashtriya Janata Dal, at least four senior Congress leaders are understood to have bowed out of the race to avoid possible defeat and have been replaced by the party?s ?second choice?.

 On the same day, the party received a jolt when its candidate from Gaya Town, Awadhesh Kumar Singh, resigned and announced that he would contest the Gaya Mufassil seat as an Independent. 

 Talking to The Telegraph this afternoon, Singh said he was under ?immense pressure? from his supporters, including a large number of minority community voters, to contest the election as an Independent candidate since they did not want him to ?desert? the people of Gaya Mufassil. 

 Singh had won the 1980, 1985 and 1990 elections as a Congress candidate from Gaya Mufassil but narrowly lost from the same constituency in 2000.

 A Congress functionary said among the four who declined to contest the elections were former chief minister Chandrashekhar Singh?s wife Manorama Singh from Banka, Dhanraj Singh from Jamui, Ajay Kumar from Dinara in Rohtas and Satyendra Kumar from Arrah in Bhojpur. 

 The development has come as Congress veteran Ramashray Prasad Singh, denied a ticket from Warsaliganj in Nawada, today joined the Lok Janshakti Party led by Ram Vilas Paswan and was reportedly promised a seat in the second or the third phase.

 State Congress president Ram Jatan Sinha, who was believed to be the party?s nominee from Makhdumpur in Jehanabad, will contest the Warsaliganj seat from where the LJP has fielded its sitting MLA Aruna Devi.

 ?The initial euphoria in the party over contesting 80 seats is fast disappearing. The reality of having friendly contests with the RJD ? and even with the LJP in some constituencies ? has become our biggest worry now. The party is also not sure of the upper caste votes, now that it is clear we are in a pseudo alliance with the RJD,? Congress sources said.

 The RJD?s stand that it will not concede ground to the Congress except where it has a sitting MLA has also disturbed the party leaders. ?We were banking on the Muslim and Dalit votes in a big way. But with the RJD and the LJP already in the field, we are not sure how many of these voters will prefer the Congress,? the sources added.

 Although the situation will become clear only after January 19, the last date for the withdrawal of nominations, RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav?s charge that Paswan has a ?pact? with the NDA has failed to move the LJP.

 ?Laloo Prasad says we have fielded our candidates in some seats that the Congress is contesting. He believes this is an indication of our so-called pact with the NDA. But the fact is that we too have to judge our strongholds and accordingly field candidates. But the picture is not yet final,? LJP sources said.

 The RJD president has taken exception to the LJP fielding a good number of Yadav and Muslim candidates. This, according to him, is an attempt to disturb the traditional vote base of the RJD.

 An LJP leader, however, said: ?Laloo Prasad should have no doubt that we are in the race tso defeat the RJD and that is our first priority. It is our prerogative to decide our candidates.?

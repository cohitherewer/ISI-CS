 Amarmani back on CBI radar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 17: The CBI is planning to file an affidavit in the Supreme Court this week seeking cancellation of bail to Bahujan Samaj Party leader Amarmani Tripathi and his wife Madhumani in the Madhumita Shukla murder case.

 The Tripathis and four others, including a police officer, are facing trial over the murder of the poetess by two assailants in her house in Lucknow on May 9, 2003.

 Madhumitas sister had deposed that the victim had an intimate relationship with Tripathi and the former Uttar Pradesh minister was arrested by the CBI. Investigations and a DNA test revealed that Madhumita was seven months pregnant with the BSP leaders child.

 The CBI alleged that the poet was murdered after she refused to abort the child. 

 Three of the accused are in jail, while the Tripathis and the police official are out on bail.

 Sleuths, CBI sources said, have collected a lot of evidence against Tripathi and his wife, including threats and inducements to witnesses to change statements in favour of the accused.

 A large part of the evidence is fresh ? from January to June this year ? and would help substantiate that, despite a notice from the Supreme Court in February, the Tripathis did not stop threatening witnesses and trying to sabotage the case.

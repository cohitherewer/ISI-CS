 Bhagirathi row

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Centre today told the Supreme Court that the apprehension about the future disappearance of the Bhagirathi in the absence of water release from the Tehri dam was based on hypothesis, reports our legal correspondent.

 It may be incorrect to assume that the sub-surface flows have started and that the river is flowing in its aquifer around and below Tehri dam, the Centre said in a counter-affidavit, replying to a PIL that said the Bhagirathi may go underground like the mythical Saraswati.

 The PIL had said the dam on Bhagirathi was not performing as expected, with most of its water finding its way into a deep aquifer due to low release of storage water for surface flow.

 In its reply, the Centre said the dam and its surrounding areas have been extensively studied by the Geological Survey of India using modern scientific methods, including satellite data and digital image processing, and no such thing as a deep aquifer near Tehri dam is reported to exist.

 As such, there is no deep-seated major fault existing in the close vicinity of the dam site as given in the hypothetical model presented by the petitioner, the Centre said.

 Key lies with baby mice

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Millions of baby mice born and bred in super-clean laboratories would need to be killed each year to protect children in India at the risk of developing the potentially deadly Japanese encephalitis (JE).

 Therein lies the logistical hurdle that has stymied attempts by health authorities to combat repeated outbreaks of JE in recent years across 15 southern and eastern states, including Bengal. At least 300 children have died over the past three weeks in the latest outbreak in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh. 

 Although a vaccine against JE is produced at the Central Research Institute (CRI) in Kasauli, medical experts say not enough doses are available to protect all children in JE risk areas, typically marked by the triad of paddy, pigs and Culex mosquitoes.

 The virus lives harmlessly in pigs and Culex mosquitoes are abundant around paddy fields. When mosquitoes feed on pigs, they pick up the JE virus and transmit it to humans when they bite people. 

 The virus attacks the brain and can kill as many as three in 10 infected children. The vaccine is made by coaxing the JE virus to grow inside the brains of young mice from where it is extracted after sacrificing the animals. 

 The CRI has the infrastructure to produce about 500,000 doses of JE vaccine. But experts estimate that, given the persistence of JE outbreaks in recent years, India would require more than five million doses to protect children in the risk areas.

 A single dose needs one mouse and the mice need to be disease-free and maintained in absolutely clean laboratory environment. Building an animal facility that can breed and house millions of mice poses an enormous and expensive logistical challenge, said Sudanshu Vrati, a scientist at the National Institute of Immunology (NII) in New Delhi, trying to find alternative routes for a JE vaccine.

 In his laboratory, Vrati has developed a technique to get the JE virus to grow inside monkey kidney cells, a process that allows the virus to multiply in large numbers for vaccine production without relying on mice brains.

 Through animal tests, NII scientists have shown that the JE virus from the monkey kidney cells, when killed, can serve as a JE vaccine. The NII has licensed this alternative vaccine production technology to Panacea Biotech, an Indian drugs company.

 Panacea is tailoring the technology for industrial scale and preparing for toxicological tests. We expect this JE vaccine to be ready for the market in three years, said Rajesh Jain of Panacea.

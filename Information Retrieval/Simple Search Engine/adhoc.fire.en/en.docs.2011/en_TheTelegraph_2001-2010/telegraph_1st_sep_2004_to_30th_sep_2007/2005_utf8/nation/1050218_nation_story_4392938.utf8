 Drug slur on actor in Dubai

 Dubai, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Actor Vijay Raaz was detained in the United Arab Emirates this week for allegedly possessing drugs, an Indian diplomat said today.

 He said Raaz, renowned for his role in the internationally acclaimed film Monsoon Wedding, was arrested at Abu Dhabi airport and referred to the public prosecutor yesterday. ?The UAE authorities told us that he had drugs in his possession,? the diplomat said. ?We have yet to see him and do not have many details at this time.?

 Abu Dhabi police officials were not immediately available to comment on the case.

 Raaz was due to start filming a new movie in the UAE. His wife Krishna, speaking to local newspapers from Mumbai, said her husband had never taken drugs in his life.

 Diplomats say the UAE, and especially Dubai, is a busy route for drug trafficking between Asia and Europe.

 The Gulf state has a zero-tolerance policy towards any one found possessing drugs and smugglers face possible death sentences. But in practice, traffickers are rarely executed.

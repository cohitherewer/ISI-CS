 New road for Oxford entry

 This has sometimes led to whimsical choices but today the underlying problem is that there simply arent enough places to go around. Of the 12,500 pupils who apply to Oxford currently, 80 per cent have three or more A grades in their school-leaving Advanced Level exams. But there are only 3,000 undergraduate places. 

 The government now wants the university to discriminate positively in favour of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. It argues, for example, that a working-class Bangladeshi Muslim girl from an inner-city comprehensive school who gets, say, grades A, B and C in her A levels shows greater potential than the son of an Indian tycoon who is coached to get four As from a top-flight public school like Eton or Harrow.

 It is true that in the Wodehousian past a candidate, who said, I want to come to this college because my Dad was here, would be looked upon with a kindly eye. Today, the same candidate would be out on his ear if he expressed the same sentiments.

 There have long been apocryphal stories about how a candidate got in if he caught the rugby ball the admissions tutor tossed on entering the room. The candidate who drop-kicked the ball into the tutors wastepaper basket was in with an open scholarship, it was alleged.

 Anyone who passed the college test for admission was eligible. 

 Much has changed. The open scholarships have gone, as have nearly all the single-sex colleges. Mens colleges have been admitting women for many years now. 

 What the colleges zealously guarded was their right to decide whom they wanted. Under the proposed changes, that right is about to be taken away and given to a central department-based admissions group. Successful candidates would be allocated colleges, perhaps taking into account the candidates preferences. 

 Given that over the centuries Oxford and Cambridge have encouraged loyalty to college rather than to the university, the change being proposed is quite radical.

 According to Oxfords statement, the discussion paper proposes that there should be a single model for handling undergraduate applications covering all subjects. Building on best practice as it currently exists in several subjects, it outlines two possible options. 

 Both options envisage a single university-wide model for handling undergraduate applications in all subjects, but with differing approaches to the involvement of individual colleges in the process. 

 Under the first model, all those shortlisted would have, at least, two interviews. Successful candidates would, if they so wished, indicate a first and second college preference. Colleges would then select from amongst them. All successful candidates would be found a college place.

 Under the second model, candidates would continue, if they wished, to state a college preference at the time of application. They would be ranked at shortlisting and final offer stage by subject tutors collectively. Those shortlisted would be interviewed by tutors in two colleges. Colleges would be guided but not absolutely bound by the rankings. 

 The chairman of the working party, Sir Tim Lankester, president of Corpus Christi College, said: At Oxford we keep our admissions procedures under constant review, and in autumn 2004 we set up a working party as part of that ongoing process. 

 Lankester emphasises: We are committed to upholding the colleges traditional commitment to excellence in the teaching of undergraduates, and the proposals do not affect the autonomous status of colleges or the way teaching is organised.

 The discussion paper will be considered by various committees representing the colleges, divisions, departments and faculties, and by college governing bodies. In the light of their views, recommendations will be put to the universitys Educational Standards and Policy Committee and to the Conference of Colleges. A decision will not be taken before summer 2006.

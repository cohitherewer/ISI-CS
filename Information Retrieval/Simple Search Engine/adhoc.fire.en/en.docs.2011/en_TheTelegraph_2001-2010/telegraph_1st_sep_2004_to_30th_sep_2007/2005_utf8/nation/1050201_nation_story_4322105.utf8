The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No bets, but cash pot boils

 Chautala: Cloud thickens

 Hisar (Haryana), Jan. 31: A popular satta bazaar in Hansi, a small town located along the Delhi-Fazilka national highway close to this central Haryana town, wears a forlorn look even though just three days are left for the Assembly polls.

 Betting on the Assembly elections has not really taken off. Those who frequent the bazaar hardly seem to think that there is big money for the taking by betting on the outcome of the February 3 polls.

 This, local satta market watchers said, is in sharp contrast with the feverish pitch of betting eight months ago when some made a killing by putting their money on a defeat of the BJP-led NDA in the Lok Sabha elections. ?Unless you are so stupid, you will not put your money on a win for Om Prakash Chautala?s Indian National Lok Dal or the BJP,? said a keen Haryana political watcher, explaining the lull in the satta bazaar.

 Not even hardcore Chautala loyalists in the party strongholds of central Haryana districts like Bhiwani, Hisar, Jind, Sirsa and Rohtak seem willing to put their money on the INLD. All that they are certain is that their leader would win in Rori, one of the two constituencies that Chautala is contesting to retain his place in the Assembly, the other seat being Narwana where he is facing an uphill task.

 A cloud of despondency hangs heavy in the INLD camp. ?This government (Chautala) is not going to come back. Somehow, people don?t want the INLD to return to power,? Ajit Singh, an aged Jat leader of the party in Rohtak town, said. Though Chautala has denied party tickets to as many as 22 sitting MLAs to make way for new faces to fight the perceived anti-incumbency sentiment among voters, Singh believes ?the leader is preparing candidates for the next elections?.

 It is not just that there is not much money to be made from the satta bazaar. A large number of candidates put up by the main political parties ? the INLD and the Congress ? appear to be reluctant to loosen their purse strings for their campaign even though they might have spent a fortune to get party tickets.

 ?Many INLD candidates think they will lose the elections and, therefore, they are not liberally funding their campaign. On the other hand, Congress candidates in most of the constituencies think they will win with ease with a perceived anti-INLD wave sweeping the state. So they, too, are a bit tight-fisted,? said Ajay Malhotra, a political analyst and poll watcher based here.

 Local village and town leaders, particularly in the Congress camp, are making the best of the situation. With the wind blowing heavily in favour of the Congress, the local leaders are investing in their would-be MLAs and ministers.

 The so-called chai parties have become an integral part of the candidates? campaign in rural areas. Every time the candidate enters a village, politically ambitious villagers host tea parties for him ? sometimes the number going up to a dozen in a single village. With chai also come ?voluntary money contributions?. The amount so collected by a candidate, if he is seen as the frontrunner, can even be in the range of Rs 3 to 10 lakh a day.

 Those contributing the money aspire for the post of the would-be MLA?s local agent or contractor in the village. After each chai party, the candidate gets a list of persons who have made contributions along with the amount donated by them.

 ?Kuchh paane ke liye kuchh khona bhi hein. Hum abhi denge aur baad mein lenge (You have to lose something to gain some. We will give now and take back later),? said Rajesh Kumar, who contributed Rs 11,001 to the Congress candidate in a village in Bhiwani district.

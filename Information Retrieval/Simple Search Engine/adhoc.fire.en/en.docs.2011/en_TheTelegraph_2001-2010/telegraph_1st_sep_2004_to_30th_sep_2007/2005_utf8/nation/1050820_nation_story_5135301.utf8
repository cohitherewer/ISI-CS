 Sanctions cry rises in Delhi

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: Delhi should urge major donors to impose economic sanctions on Bangladesh and force Begum Khaleda Zia to clamp down on Islamic fundamentalist outfits such as the one that exploded bombs across the country this week, Indian security agencies have recommended to the government.

 A detailed study of the security situation in Bangladesh by the agencies and an analysis of the blasts that rocked the country on Wednesday have pointed the needle of suspicion at groups that are banned and are known to fan anti-India sentiment.

 An immediate report on the blasts says there were 370 explosions in 63 of Bangladeshs 64 districts. The kind of explosives used and the impact of each blast were similar to the one on August 13 at a Muslim shrine in Akhaura in which one person was killed and 30 injured.

 The report notes that this is the first time government institutions have been targeted and also describes the blasts as the biggest strike by fundamentalists in Bangladeshs history. It says the attack was co-ordinated and that the level of co-ordination pointed to the involvement of more than one fundamentalist outfit.

 The outfits were emboldened because of the lack of tangible action by the Khaleda government. The blasts are intended to be a message to Dhaka and discourage the government from succumbing to international pressure to clamp down on the outfits, the report says.

 It notes that leaflets in the name of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen were found. The outfit, banned in August 2003, is known to be active in four districts of Bangladesh ? Rajshahi, Joypurhat, Rangpur and Dinajpur North West ? and is funded by a Saudi Arabia-based NGO, Al-Fallah Azam Development Organisation.

 The report also says there are insinuations that an earlier blast in August 2004 was suspected to have been inspired by Indias Research and Analysis Wing. It says it is possible that efforts will be on to malign India again by pointing fingers at Delhi.

 The latest report and analysis of the multiple blasts come in the backdrop of serious efforts mounted by Delhi to get the Khaleda government to act against fundamentalist organisations. The subject also figured in the discussions minister for external affairs K. Natwar Singh had with his counterpart Morshed Khan in Dhaka on August 6.

 A separate detailed study circulated in the top echelons of the Indian security establishment says Delhi should actively consider economic measures against Bangladesh. It says such measures are more effective than military might in curbing fundamentalist militancy because Bangladeshs economy is already teetering on the brink.

 It points out that Bangladesh depends to a large extent on US and Japanese aid.

 Phone bridge for families

 Srinagar, Oct. 19 (Agencies): Dozens of anxious Kashmiris queued up today to speak to relatives on the Pakistani side after India opened phone lines for the first time in nearly 16 years to link families hit by this months quake.

 The phone link came a day after Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf appealed to India to allow Kashmiris to cross the Line of Control to help each other.

 Authorities installed the free telephones in Srinagar and the border towns of Uri and Tangdhar.

 The first call at 1.15 pm was made by Abdul Gani, who came all the way from Basbpora in Baramulla, 60 km from here, to the temporary telecom centre set up at the police control room. He called his uncle in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and was relieved to know all his relatives had survived.

 Abdul Rehaman, a Srinagar resident, said: I called my aunt in Muzaffarabad. Thank god she and her family survived but their house is completely damaged.

 Fayaz Ahmad Bhat, who had come from Tangmarg in Baramulla, could not speak to his mother Fatima who had gone to Muzaffarabad on September 8 to see her father. She had been shifted to a camp. But my relatives told me she is all right, Bhat said happily.

 When you meet her, tell her Chhoti (his younger sister) is not eating as she is worried about her. Dont hold her back anymore. Send her home at the earliest, Bhat, accompanied by his maternal uncle, told his relative over phone.

 Farooq Ahmad, from Srinagar, however, was unable to reach his sister in PoK.

 The phone link ? cut since the onset of militancy in 1989 ? is seen as the first sign that the rivals are trying to bridge political differences to help quake victims.

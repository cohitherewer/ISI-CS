 Laloo stamp on Cong crown

 Sadanand: On right track

 New Delhi, June 30: Sonia Gandhi has appointed the pro-Laloo Prasad Yadav leader, Sadanand Singh, as Bihar Congress president.

 The move comes 10 days after former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh, another Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) favourite, was handed charge of Congress affairs in the state.

 With this, the Congress has sent a clear signal that it has jettisoned the doubts that had clouded its approach towards the RJD during the previous Bihar Assembly polls. The party now favours a comprehensive pre-poll alliance with Laloo Prasads party in the repeat Assembly polls later this year.

 Digvijay, who barely hides his preference for the RJD, met Laloo Prasad at the railway ministry headquarters just as the Congress announced Sadanands appointment as the chief of its Bihar unit.

 For Sadanand, who replaces Ram Jatan Sinha, a bitter critic of the railway minister, it is his second stint in the post. His proximity to Laloo Prasad had helped him become Speaker of the Assembly when Rabri Devi formed a coalition government after the 2000 Assembly polls.

 Sadanand, who is from the backward Kurmi community to which Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar also belongs, was in New Delhi for talks with the partys central leaders ahead of his formal appointment.

 The Digvijay-Sadanand duo will aim to bring all United Progressive Alliance partners together to take on the BJP-JD(U) combine.

 Digvijay will prod Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan to make up with Laloo Prasad. The former chief minister also believes that the Congress should do some plain-speaking to Paswan if he persists with his rigid anti-Laloo Prasad stand and scuttles efforts towards a comprehensive pre-poll secular alliance.

 On his part, after his meeting with Digvijay, Laloo Prasad made reconciliatory gestures towards Paswan. 

 For us, no secular party is untouchable, let people say whatever they want, the RJD chief said. We have to fight jointly. Be it Assembly polls or any other elections, our aim is to defeat the communal forces.

 Laloo Prasad confirmed that his talks with Digvijay had focused on the need to form a total secular alliance.

 Many have read political significance in the railway ministers presence at the wedding reception of Paswans daughter at the latters official residence in Delhi.

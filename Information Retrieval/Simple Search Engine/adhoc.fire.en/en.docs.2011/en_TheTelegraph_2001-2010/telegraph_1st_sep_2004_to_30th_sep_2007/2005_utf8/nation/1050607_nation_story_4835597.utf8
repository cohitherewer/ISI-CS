 Natwar heads for stormy island

 New Delhi, June 6: Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh will leave for Sri Lanka later this week for bilateral talks amid threats from the ruling coalitions Marxist partner, the Janatha Vimukhti Perumana, to withdraw support to the Chandrika Kumaratunga government.

 The JVP and some sections have been voicing their protest against Kumaratungas decision to involve the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the distribution of the three-billion-dollar tsunami aid package the island nation has received from the international community.

 The JVP and the others feel the government is unnecessarily giving legitimacy to the Tamil Tigers who have done nothing yet to show their commitment to peace.

 In the ancient hill capital of Kandy, hundreds of monks in saffron robes protested against the proposed aid-sharing deal, as a top member of Sri Lankas all-Buddhist monk party ? which is opposed to the rebels ? began a fast.

 The partys general secretary, venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thero, started a fast unto death today, said Venerable Athuraliye Rathana Thero, parliamentary group leader of the hardline Jathika Hela Urumaya.

 We will do anything, even put our lives on the line, to stop the President from agreeing to a joint aid-sharing deal with the Tigers, he added.

 Singh is scheduled to visit the island from June 8 to 10, ostensibly to take part in the meeting of the Joint Economic Commission set up by the two countries. But sources said the minister would meet a number of important leaders and, perhaps, also those of the JVP ? a party with which Delhi has been improving ties over the past few years.

 Kumaratunga, who was in Delhi recently, had sought support for her move to involve the LTTE in the relief operations, especially in the rebel strongholds. But South Block has officially maintained that it does not want to get involved in Sri Lankas internal politics.

 Officials said even if Singh meets the JVP leaders or others in Colombo, he would not advise them what they should do, though his presence is sure to fuel speculation whether India will play a role in resolving the controversy.

 We want to maintain good relations with every political party in Sri Lanka without getting involved in their internal affairs, a senior foreign ministry official said, adding that India has always been in favour of a consensus among the islands political parties on handling the peace process. But ultimately, the decision as to how they want to go about it rests with the Sri Lankan government and the political parties.

 In private, however, Indian officials said Kumaratunga decided to keep the JVP and the others out of the consultation process because she knew that none of them would support her move to involve the Tamil Tigers in the rehabilitation operations.

 Perhaps, Kumaratunga knows that ultimately the JVP and others will stop short of pulling down her government, a senior official in South Block said.

 Withdrawal of support by the JVP, the official explained, would mean a situation that would bring its sworn enemy, the United National Party ? now in the Opposition ? to form the government. Or, maybe, the official added, she (Kumaratunga) is banking on the Tamil National Alliance to bail her out if the JVP withdraws support.

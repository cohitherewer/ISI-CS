 Patna, May 13: Patna police today busted a gang dealing in stolen cellphones.

 A police team raided a hotel here and seized 124 handsets, believed to be stolen in the past six months, and arrested three persons, including hotel-owner Pappu Gupta.

 Although Gupta has claimed to be innocent, another accused, Utam Mahto, has acknowledged they have been in the business for the past six months, city superintendent of police Shalin said. He added that the owners of the stolen mobile phones could retrieve the handsets from their respective police stations after declaring their numbers. 

 The city police claimed that the arrested trio was part of an international racket. We are interrogating the three for the details of the racket as well as leads on the rest of the members, an official said.

 The criminals hit the engineers son, Rakesh, with a rifle when he resisted them. He recovered soon and caught one of them, who was beaten to death by the mob. K.P. Yadav of Jakkanpur police station said raids were on to arrest the second criminal.

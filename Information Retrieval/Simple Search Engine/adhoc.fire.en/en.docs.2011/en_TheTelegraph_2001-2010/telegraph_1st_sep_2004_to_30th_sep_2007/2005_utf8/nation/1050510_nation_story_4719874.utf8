 Junior docs call off strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, May 9: Junior doctors at the Patna Medical College Hospital suspended their strike today, the fourth day of the agitation. 

 ?The chief secretary has agreed to all our demands and assured to notify them by May 13,? Junior Doctors Association president Gauhar Alam said. The doctors are demanding a raise in their stipend from Rs 7,000-8,500 to Rs 14,000-16,000 and ?proper? housing facilities.

 About 500 postgraduate students of PMCH went on an indefinite strike on Friday night. They next day, those of Darbhanga Medical College Hospital joined them. 

 The government had announced a minimal increase in their stipend last July after a prolonged strike. The Junior Doctors Association of PMCH allege their stipend is still far below than that in Jharkhand and other states.

 Jharkhand is understood to be paying a monthly stipend of Rs 14,000. ?It is a big difference; we are being treated unjustly. This should end,? Alam said.

 The district civil surgeon had reportedly deployed about 20 doctors for emergency services at PMCH.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 12: A former Andhra Pradesh Ranji player and chairman of the state juniors? selection committee was kidnapped this morning and released after two hours.

 V. Chamundeswar Nath was pushed into a Mercedes Benz while on a morning walk in Brahmananda Reddy Park at 5.30 and released 10 km away after two hours of grilling, said K.V. Venkat Reddy, the additional deputy commissioner of police, city task force.

 Sandeep, a relative of Nath, Faizal, Saleem and Muneer were arrested. 

 The police said Sandeep had a hand in Nath?s abduction a few months ago when Rs 6 lakh was extracted from him. Sandeep denied this.

 The four suspects told the media in police presence that they took away Nath ? whose name has figured in relation to the cricket match-fixing scam ? because of his intervention in Sandeep?s love affair with a girl who is Nath?s cousin.

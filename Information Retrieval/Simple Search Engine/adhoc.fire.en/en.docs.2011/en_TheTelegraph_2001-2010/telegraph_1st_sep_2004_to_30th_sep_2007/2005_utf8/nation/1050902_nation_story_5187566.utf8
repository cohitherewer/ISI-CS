 Treasure trackers turn to Birla coins

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: After the discovery of the treasure trove, it is time for documentation. 

 A four-member team of special officers, appointed by Calcutta High Court to draw up an inventory of the personal belongings of Priyamvada Birla, today started preparing a list of gold coins ? some of them apparently dating back to the Gupta, Maurya and Mughal empires ? they chanced upon on Tuesday evening. 

 The valuable items were found stashed inside seven to eight wooden boxes in an almirah in a strong room hidden behind a wooden panel at Priyamvadas bungalow in Birla Park. They also discovered three pistols and gold artefacts inside the Godrej almirah. 

 Special officers Ahin Chowdhury, Ashoke Banerjee, I.P. Mukherjee and Pradeep Ghosh, who completed listing other items yesterday, took up the boxes containing the coins today following instructions from the high court to conduct the exercise as fast as possible. 

 Along with a number of guineas, the team also found gold coins ? apparently of antique value ? as they opened one of the wooden boxes. The team could complete listing the contents of only one box and put the valuables in a safe, guarded by eight armed security guards round-the-clock. 

 Two representatives each from the Birla and the Lodha sides accompanied the special officers. Both sides have divergent views on the volume and value of the assets of MP and Priyamvada Birla.

 Sources in the Birla family are claiming that the assets will be worth more than Rs 500 crore, a valuation the Lodha camp has termed disinformation. 

 Earlier disclosures in the court by both sides did not make any mention of the treasure in the strongroom.

 An affidavit accompanying Lodhas petition to authenticate Priyamvadas 1999 will had pegged the value of jewellery, ornaments, silver utensils and other assets at Rs 16.22 lakh. 

 Birla familys valuation was not far away as the affidavit filed along with the petition to authenticate the couples twin wills of 1982 valued the assets at Rs 50 lakh.

 TRS piles policy heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: The Telengana Rashtra Samiti has threatened to pull out of the Congress-led government at the Centre unless Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy reviews his policy on Naxalites.

 The partys main demands are that the Reddy government should lift the ban on the rebel groups and stop using police to harass and intimidate residents of the Telengana region. For the moment, the TRS has put its cry for a separate Telengana state to the background.

 Party chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tonight, but refused to divulge any details. He also held meetings with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Union home minister Shivraj Patil. Rao submitted a memorandum to Sonia, accusing the Reddy government of breach of trust.

 The TRS will meet Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar, Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and other UPA leaders (barring those from the Congress) on September 8 and decide whether it will continue to be part of the ruling coalition in Delhi.

 The party, whose lone representative in the Union cabinet is labour and employment minister Rao, has withdrawn its ministers from the Andhra cabinet and snapped ties with the Congress for the forthcoming elections to local bodies.

 TRS general secretary V. Prakash said the immediate provocation for the party was an interview Reddy gave to a regional daily, in which he reportedly said the creation of small states would weaken national integration and that the Telengana issue was losing momentum by the day. 

 The TRS was also upset by the chief ministers request for additional security forces and helicopters from the Centre for deployment in the Telengana region. 

 There are hundreds of policemen who are troubling the poor farmers. After 10 years, we have had good rainfall this time in Telengana. People are able to cultivate their crops but when they go out in their fields, they are picked up by the cops. Several farmers have fled their villages in fright, Prakash said.

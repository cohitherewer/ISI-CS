 Pakistani woman?s stay plea dismissed

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, April 22: A 

 73-year-old Indian-born Pakistani woman, who wanted to spend 

 the twilight of her life here with her brothers? family, 

 will have to leave the country tomorrow on expiry of her 

 visa.

 Delhi High Court today dismissed her plea for grant of a residence permit or to even extend the visa in spite of her precarious living conditions without dependants and property in Pakistan.

 Justice Gita Mittal turned down Mariam-un-Nisha?s plea on the ground that there was no proof of her birth in India and that she had not made any proper application for a residence permit.

 The counsel for the Union home ministry, Sanjeev Kumar Dubey, pointed out the lapses in her plea because of which the government could not grant her any relief.

 The court also rejected her plea to visit Delhi in view of the fact that her visa was due to expire tomorrow.

 However, the court issued a notice to the Centre on the maintainability of her petition, asking it to file a reply within three weeks.

 Earlier, the Centre had rejected Mariam-un-Nisha?s plea for grant of Indian citizenship and advised her to apply for it only after residing in the country for seven years as required under the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955.

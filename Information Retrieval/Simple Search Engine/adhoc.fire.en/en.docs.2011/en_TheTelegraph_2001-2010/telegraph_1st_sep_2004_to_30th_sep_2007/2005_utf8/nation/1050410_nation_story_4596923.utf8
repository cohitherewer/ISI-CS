 Man hacks daughters

 Lucknow, April 9: Bareilly police have arrested a man for hacking his two daughters to death.

 When 51-year-old Sagir Ahmed found out that one of his daughters ? both had eloped with their boyfriends ? was pregnant, he was gripped by an unbearable sense of shame. 

 The girls returned home at Jadonpur village in Bareilly district in western Uttar Pradesh three days ago. On Thursday, Sagir drew out his sword and chopped his sleeping daughters to pieces. 

 He fled to Uttaranchal?s Rudrapur area, from where he was picked up by the police.

 Bareilly superintendent of police Neera Rawat said Sagir has admitted his crime. ?He was fearing social ostracism ? and hence planned to kill his two daughters,? he said.

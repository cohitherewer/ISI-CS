 Britain amp; Ballia rise in revolt

 - Empire savaged just for the sake of it, cry historians

 CHRIS HASTINGS AND BETH JONES

 London, Aug. 14: The government-backed UK Film Council has been attacked for investing ?150,000 of lottery funds in a Bollywood film that savages British rule in India.

 Historians say The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey (the English version of Mangal Pandey ? The Rising) is littered with historical inaccuracies.

 The movie, which features Bollywood star Aamir Khan and British actor Toby Stephens, is damning about the rule of the British East India Company in the years leading up to the Indian Mutiny of 1857.

 The ?6.5-million production, which is largely in English and which opened across Britain on Friday, accuses the company of murdering civilians to further its interests and of flouting the Empire-wide ban on slavery.

 Saul David, the author of The Indian Mutiny: 1857, attacked the depictions as fabrication. I am no apologist for the British East India Company but I have never come across any evidence which supports either of these assertions, he said. It is nonsense. Of course a certain amount of criticism is justified but this sounds like vilification of the British just for the sake of it.

 David is scathing about the films central claim that the bloody events of 1857 were sparked by the companys insistence that Muslim and Hindu sepoys used bullet casings covered in beef and pork fat.

 In reality, he insists, the company withdrew the cartridges in the light of the concerns and did not issue them to a single sepoy.

 Hugo Swire, the Conservative arts spokesman, questioned the wisdom of supporting such a film. I would be interested to know by what criteria the Film Council judged this film to be worthy of financial backing, he said. It is not particularly helpful in the current climate.

 I personally think the council should concentrate on supporting British films. I do not see why they see the need to support a movie financially that has been produced by the Indian film industry, he said.

 Bobby Bedi, the films producer, accepted that some of the scenes were conjecture but insisted the film was against the East India Company, not anti-Britain.

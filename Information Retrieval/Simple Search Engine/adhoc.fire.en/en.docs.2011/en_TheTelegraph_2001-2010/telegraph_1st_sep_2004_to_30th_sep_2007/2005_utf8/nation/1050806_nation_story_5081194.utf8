 Hotline with Pakistan

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: An announcement on a hotline between the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan is likely to be made tomorrow, reports our special correspondent.

 The two sides are also close to narrowing down differences on an agreement on prior notification of test-firing ballistic missiles. If all goes well, this pact may be made public which will signal a crucial confidence-building measure (CBM) between the nuclear neighbours.

 Experts from the two countries met today to discuss steps on nuclear CBMs. The two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, is aimed at reducing accidental use of nuclear weapons against each other. 

 The discussion will help calm jitters the world over about a possible nuclear war in South Asia and will add to the overall strengthening of the peace process.

 Till a decade ago, a hotline existed between the foreign secretaries. Ever since the neighbours decided to normalise ties, the question of reviving it had cropped up several times.

 Test for prince in king?s land

 K.C. PHILIP

 Bettiah, Feb. 22: The king has fielded the prince in the land of dacoits

 Meet Bhagar Yadav, the terror of West Champaran. Held in awe by thousands, the strongman has given his son Amar Yadav the opportunity to prove his mettle as a Rashtriya Janata Dal candidate from the Nauthan constituency.

 In 2000, Amar lost to Vaidyanath Kushwaha of the Janata Dal (United). Kushwaha, who developed his base by forming armed village protection forces, had challenged Bhagar?s ?supremacy? in the constituency. Two years later, Amar tasted victory in the district council polls and became the zilla parishad chairman.

 Amar and Kushwaha are pitted against each other once again and all eyes are on this battle of musclepower. ?People here are scared and vote under pressure. If threats don?t work, guns are used. Bhagar is doing the rounds of villages in broad daylight,? says a villager in Bettiah, shedding light on Bhagar?s ?reign? in Dhanaha, Bettiah and Nauthan.

 While records show that 107 cases have been lodged against Bhagar, police have failed to arrest him even once in the 25 years of his association with crime. ?Police claim that they are in ?hot pursuit? of Bhagar, but we know that their vehicles are actually escorting him,? says a villager in Nauthan.

 ?Bhagar is invincible. He is after all Laloo Prasad Yadav?s man. Laloo?s police not only protect him but also seek his help to arrest small-time criminals and solve cases,? says another villager. 

 A police source confided that they sought Bhagar?s help in rescuing the abducted NHPC engineers last year.

 If many past superintendents of police are known to have dined with Bhagar, one or two are remembered for taking him on in his own territory but were later forced to retreat following Laloo Prasad?s intervention.

 Yadav lives in style in his ?fortress? on a small island in the middle of the Gandak in Bairia block. Armed men guard the ghats and none can get in without an appointment. His son Amar too leads a lavish life in a British bungalow in the heart of the district headquarters at Bettiah.

 Before the elections, Bhagar usually stayed indoors during the day and came out only after sundown. For the police, this has been a convenient excuse for years for failing to arresting him.

 ?These days, he roams around openly, holding durbars. People can go to Bhagar but the police can?t reach him,? says a villager.

 Bhagar?s brother Sattan Yadav contested the 1995 Assembly polls from Nauthan and won on the promise-cum-threat of ?vote for me and sleep fearlessly with open doors?. He was later arrested on criminal charges and sent to jail for three years.

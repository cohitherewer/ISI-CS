 Pak returns soldier who strayed

 Srinagar, Oct. 9 (PTI): Pakistani troops returned an Indian soldier who had inadvertently crossed the Line of Control after the earthquake.

 One of our soldiers, who had gone across the Line of Control, was returned by the Pakistanis in Tangdhar sector, Jammu and Kashmir governor Lt Gen. (Retd) S.K. Sinha said after visiting Tangdhar, among the worst-affected areas.

 During his visit to the affected border pockets today, Sinha was told the army had lost 54 personnel. Some forward defences and pickets have also suffered heavy damage.

 At the Eagle picket in the sector, 12 soldiers went down 3,000 feet with a landslide. The bodies have not yet been found. Flag meetings have been held on the Line of Control with the Pakistani commanders and help offered.

 Army patrols had contacted remote villages to assess damage and recover casualties, Sinha said, adding that all should be reached by tomorrow.

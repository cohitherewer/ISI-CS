 Rebels expose ?helpless? cops

 GAUTAM SARKAR

 Jamui, April 7: An ill-equipped and short-staffed Jamalpur Government Railway Police (GRP) seems to be fighting a losing battle with Maoists.

 Senior GRP officers, who conducted a spot inquiry at Jamui, admitted that the ?utter helplessness? of the force was exposed on Tuesday when armed Maoists attacked an escort team on the Jhajha-Patna Passenger, killing a jawan and looting three rifles. The personnel were also critical of their subordinates for ignoring intelligence reports on possible Maoist attacks.

 Inspector-general of rail police Neelmani, his deputy R.K. Singh, IG (operations) R.K. Verma and deputy inspector-general of police (Munger division) M.A. Kazmi were part of the team which conducted raids on several Naxalite-affected pockets in Jamui.

 The body of the slain GRP jawan, Naval Kishore Mishra, has been sent to his village in Chhapra district. 

 IG Neelmani said the absence of proper facilities and inadequate staff strength have made the task of fighting Maoists difficult for the GRP. He said the attackers were trained in guerrilla warfare, as they conducted the operation in a swift and calculated manner.

 ?It is enough now? the government should take notice of it (the attack). We will demand modernisation of the GRP units in the state, particularly Jamalpur zone, and filling up of all vacancies in the police stations,? a senior official said. 

 The attack took place around 6 pm when the train stopped at Katuna Halt in the Kiul-Asansol section of Eastern Railway. Armed with firearms, the Maoists first snatched a walkie-talkie set from Chandrika Shah, the driver of the train, and then attacked the GRP team, which was in the compartment behind the engine.

 Krishna Kumar, who was critically injured, was rushed to Patna last night for treatment. The third jawan, S.K. Tiwary, escaped unhurt, as he jumped from the compartment and reached Jhajha railway station, about 15 km from the site of the incident. 

 ?The armed men were abusing the GRP jawans for torturing poor vendors,? said an eyewitness in Jhajha. 

 ?The jawans regularly misbehave with passengers, especially vendors, on this route. A tribal carrying fruits was thrown out of a running train near Jamui station about three months ago. The man had his ticket but the jawans demanded money for the fruits,? a commuter said at Jhajha. 

 The senior officials, too, have come across reports of police high-handedness. ?We have received a few complaints from the local people,? they said. 

 An official said, ?We had earlier alerted the police stations on the basis of intelligence reports. We will now find out why they failed to take suitable action.?

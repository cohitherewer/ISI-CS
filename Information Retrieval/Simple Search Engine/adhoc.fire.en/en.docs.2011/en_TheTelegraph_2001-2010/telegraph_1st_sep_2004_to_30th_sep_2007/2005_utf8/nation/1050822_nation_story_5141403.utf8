 Cong plans job bill show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: The Congress is planning a nationwide campaign to reap the political dividend for bringing the rural job bill after Sonia Gandhi claimed for the party the credit for the legislation.

 The Congress chiefs outgoing team of AICC office-bearers is understood to have recommended that a two-day meeting of the 15 party chief ministers be convened in Dehra Dun on September 5 and 6. On top of the agenda is to showcase the rural job law as the Congresss accomplishment as the leading partner of the UPA government at the Centre.

 The bill is expected to be passed by Parliament before the monsoon session ends on August 25.

 Highlighting the bill, Sonia, as the UPAs leading speaker in the Lok Sabha, had traced its genesis to the Congress chief ministers conclaves held in Guwahati, Mount Abu and Srinagar when the party was in Opposition.

 It is, therefore, befitting if party chief ministers meet to hail the accomplishment, which will not only bring about positive changes in (the) rural economic situation but also in the social sphere of village life, said a former party general secretary closely associated with some of the conclaves.

 The Congress also plans to ask its state, district and block committees to highlight the law and ensure participation in implementing the job scheme in the 200 districts where it will be initially launched.

 Poll team on Bihar recce

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: The Election Commission is sending a two-member team to Bihar tomorrow to monitor the implementation of its anti-crime order, reports our special correspondent.

 Last week, the commission ordered returning officers to delete from the voters list the names of persons wanted by the law for more than six months.

 Poll panel sources today said adviser K.J. Rao has already been sent to Patna and deputy election commissioner Ananth Kumar would be joining him.

 The team will also take stock of arrangements for the Assembly polls, which are likely to be held in October. 

 The Bihar administration has been directed to furnish a list of absconders by August 19.

 The panel team has been asked to report on the issuance of photo-identity cards and assess law and order. 

 The commission has directed the state and the electoral office to complete issuing photo-identity cards by September 15.

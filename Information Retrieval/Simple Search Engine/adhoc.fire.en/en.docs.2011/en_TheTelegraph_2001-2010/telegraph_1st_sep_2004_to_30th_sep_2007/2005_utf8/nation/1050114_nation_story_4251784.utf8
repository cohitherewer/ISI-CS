 Delhi mulls norms for new airlines

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: The government has decided to introduce a set of new criteria, including financial muscle and track record, for allowing an airline to be established.

 The decision has come in the wake of fears that mere fleet strength may not be enough to stall a repeat of the situation in the mid-1990s that saw three airlines ? East West, ModiLuft and Damania ? going bust in quick succession.

 Top officials stressed on the need to stop non-serious players from entering the field as fleet size could be built up through leases without sufficient financial strength to stay afloat.

 The new norms, being worked out in consultation with aviation and financial experts, are expected to set a minimum threshold level of equity. They would also take into account the experience of promoting companies or individuals.

 Last month, the government gave licences to three new airlines ? Go Air, promoted by the Wadias, Royal Airways, a resurrection of ModiLuft by an NRI group, and Kingfisher Airlines, promoted by the Vijay Mallya-owned United Breweries ? to operate in Indian skies.

 All three groups are considered financially strong, but officials said this was ?a coincidence, which we want to turn into a set criteria?.

 Officials said the government, which is trying to liberalise air travel to a number of key nations like the US, has also decided that such deals will be struck after consulting the two state-run carriers as well as private airlines.

 The airlines will be consulted on their plans for fleet acquisition and desire to operate on routes that are being thrown open. The civil aviation ministry has already written to all airlines asking them for their inputs. Talks with the US start late tonight on the basis of projections drawn up by the ministry.

 The negotiations on a new deal on air travel are expected to involve a lot of hard bargaining. The agreement is expected to further liberalise air travel between the two countries.

 The current deal that permits reciprocal service is nearly 50 years old and restricts frequency, destinations and ticket-pricing. 

 The ?open skies? negotiations are scheduled to be held over two days in Washington and represent the first formal attempt to relax restrictions on a fast-growing market that handles 1.5 million travellers a year.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel is expected to demand at least four new ports of call which will include San Francisco and Dallas. India already has rights to fly to Los Angeles, Chicago, Newark and JFK airports in New York.

 Patel is also planning to demand that the US lift ceilings on flights operated from London to Chicago by airlines from India. This move is expected to not only help Air-India, which is planning a India-London-Chicago route, but also Jet Airways, which has similar plans.

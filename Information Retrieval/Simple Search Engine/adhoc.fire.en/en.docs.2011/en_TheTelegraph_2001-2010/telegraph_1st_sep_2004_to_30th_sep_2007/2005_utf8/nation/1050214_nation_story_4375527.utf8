The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Lost: sight and reward

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Feb. 13: He lost his eyesight defending the nation?s frontiers. Today, the 75-year-old man is running from pillar to post pleading for the land the government had promised for his act of bravery 40 years ago.

 Kaka Singh was a sapper with the 51 Engineer Regiment of Bengal Engineers Group in the Khemkaran Sector in 1965. Trying to stop Pakistani soldiers from advancing into the area, Kaka lost his vision when an enemy shell landed near the soldiers who were planting mines.

 ?The enemy could see us laying the mines but that did not deter us from doing our job. I knew the danger I was facing but continued to plant mine after mine. Then everything went black. Everything is black even now. I have heard about the Kargil heroism. Perhaps the government feels that those who guarded the nation?s frontiers without fearing for their lives before Kargil happened are not entitled to any compensation,? Kaka said, his voice choking.

 Kaka?s troubles began after he was released from service in 1970. He was neither offered the Rs 1 lakh as compensation nor the 30 acres the government had promised. 

 Although records in the Ropar Zila Sainik Board claim that he was given a six-acre plot in 1970 and 10 acres in 1972, Kaka said no allotment has been made till now..

 The director of the government-run Sainik Welfare Board, retired Brigadier Joginder Singh Jaswal, himself a recipient of a similar compensation, said the state had floated a scheme few years ago to compensate jawans who suffered irreparable injuries in wars.

 ?Kaka Singh does not seem to have sent his claim. There were 22 recipients. Some had opted for money due to litigation over the land allotted to them. The dates of the applications were also extended a number of times. But I am looking into the matter,? Jaswal said.

 Kaka rues that he was blinded and not killed in the shelling. ?Who is there to listen to a blind man? My struggle began in 1966. From the Ropar deputy commissioner to Indira Gandhi, Zail Singh and the governors, I have wept in front of all of them. I wish I had died,? he said. 

 While those less unfortunate than Kaka have managed to extract large compensations from the government, Kaka received only Rs 2,000 for his wounds.

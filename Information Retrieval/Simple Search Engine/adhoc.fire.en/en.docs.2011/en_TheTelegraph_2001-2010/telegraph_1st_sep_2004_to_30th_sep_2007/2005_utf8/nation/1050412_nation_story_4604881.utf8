 Mokama priest stabbed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, April 11: A senior priest of the Patna archdiocese was stabbed by a criminal in Mokama this evening, apparently for speaking out against extortion.

 Mathew Uzhuthal, parish priest of the church in Mokama, 80 km from here, was at his home when the gangster, Gyan Kumar, allegedly walked in and attacked him with a knife. 

 Uzhuthal, 65, was stabbed in the chest and throat. He was taken to the mission hospital adjacent to the church, where an emergency operation had to be carried out. ?His condition is stable, though he is on oxygen and is being given blood,? said Doctor-Sister Anselm, who is attending on him. 

 Senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan has confirmed the attack. ?The culprit has been identified and police have registered an FIR. A hunt is on for the accused,? he said. 

 Police sources said Kumar had made extortion threats to the priest and other Christians in the area. He was also said to be sore with Uzhuthal for not helping him when he was in jail in connection with a murder. Kumar came out from prison a few days ago and has been threatening the priest ever since, the sources said. 

 Church leaders from Patna, led by Archbishop Benedict Osta, have rushed to Mokama. ?We are shocked at what has happened. We are not in a position to say what is happening,? a church official said.

 Paswan turns table on Nitish

 Patna, April 12: Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan today tried to get even with Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar and suggested that the NDA partner would do well to formally merge with the BJP.

 Kumar had yesterday suggested that the LJP should merge with the JD(U) so that a government could be easily formed in the state. Kumar?s remark had come a few days after Paswan firmly stubbed his efforts to form a non-Rashtriya Janata Dal government in Bihar.

 The LJP leader?s attack came even on a personal level as he questioned the ?standing? of Kumar in the JD(U) of which George Fernandes is the president. ?Everyone knows that Fernandes has a huge soft corner for the BJP. He even attends meetings of the BJP. It will be, therefore, apt if the two parties merge. Nitish Kumar is a nobody in the JD(U),? Paswan said.

 ?The JD(U) should stop paying lip service to secularism. You do not become secular just by attending a few iftaar parties. They (JD-U) should stop riding on two boats. On the one hand you continue in the NDA and on the other you talk about secularism. I have admitted that joining the NDA for a short while was my mistake and I am not going to repeat it,? he added.

 The LJP leader, who later left for Muzaffarpur to address a public meeting, said the people of Bihar were happy with the current spell of President?s rule. ?This is not permanent. A government will definitely be formed in six months. But for now, central rule is very good,? he said but did not give details.

 The LJP has 29 members in the hung Assembly, now being kept in suspended animation. Their support is crucial for the formation of any government in Bihar. Paswan has steadfastly refused to support the RJD or the NDA in the formation of a government. His best offer has been to ask the JD(U) to quit the NDA for the formation of a non-RJD, non-BJP government in the state, provided a Muslim is made chief minister.

 The LJP leader seems to have taken Kumar?s suggestion on merging his party with the JD(U) with a pinch of salt. ?Attempts have been made by the JD(U) to poach our MLAs. But they stand solid like steel. You should remember that I am the Union steel minister and all my MLAs have the determination of steel,? he added.

 Paswan, who had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi yesterday, refused to divulge the details of meeting and said it was a ?courtesy visit?.

 Signals from the RJD, meanwhile, indicate that the party is growing serious about snap elections being the only way to defuse the ?crisis? in Bihar. At a railway function near Hajipur yesterday, party president Laloo Prasad Yadav indicated as much and challenged his opponents to face the RJD in an election again.

 Paswan, who represents Hajipur in the Lok Sabha, did not attend the function despite being invited. The ceremony was held to rename a railway station, which falls in former chief minister Rabri Devi?s constituency, after freedom fighter Akshayvat Rai. He is perhaps the only politician to favour the ?good work? being done during President?s rule.

 Poll panel raps Bihar on code violation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: The Election Commission today rapped the Bihar administration and said it was annoyed with appointments made by the governor to constitutional bodies after the states poll schedule was announced and the model code of conduct had come into effect.

 In a letter to the Bihar chief secretary, the panel wrote: It was the duty of the officers concerned of the state government to have apprised the governor of the model code of conduct having come into force before signing and issuing the notifications in pursuance of his orders on the relevant files.

 The commission said the governor had made the appointments despite the files pending for long and had chosen the eve of the announcement of the poll schedule to put his signature on the papers. The state administrations officers have thus failed in the proper discharge of their duties and functions to observe the model code in letter and spirit.

 The commission told the chief secretary that action should be taken against the concerned officials. It also wanted the orders of appointment to be reversed.

 The poll panels reprimand comes after a two-member team studied a complaint made by a delegation of the NDA on September 6. The delegation met the commissioners and complained that governor Buta Singhs appointments to the Bihar Public Service Commission, Bihar Backward Class Commission, Bihar State Minority Commission, the 15-point programme implementation committee and the Bihar State Nagrik Parishad should be cancelled.

 The NDA memorandum cited a provision in the model code of conduct that forbids public appointments after elections are announced even in states under Presidents rule, as is the case in Bihar. It pointed out that politicians wielding influence had been appointed to public bodies. 

 Laxmi Devi and Sudama Rai, who were appointed to the public service commission, were from the RJD and the Congress. Ram Karan Pal, who was appointed to the backward class commission, is a state vice-president of the RJD. Gulam Tahir, who has made it to the minority commission, has been personal secretary to former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi.

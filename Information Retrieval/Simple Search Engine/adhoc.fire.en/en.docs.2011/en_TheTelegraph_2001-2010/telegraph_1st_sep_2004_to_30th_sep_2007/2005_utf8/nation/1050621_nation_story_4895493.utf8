 Blast rips apart Gogoi claims

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, June 20: The security establishments morale and the Assam governments belief in the peace process with Ulfa took a beating today as militants of the outlawed outfit triggered an explosion perilously close to Janata Bhawan, the seat of power.

 The explosion only shattered window-panes of a nearby building and created a crater but was enough to rattle the Tarun Gogoi ministry, which had been confidently claiming an improvement in law and order.

 The chief minister ordered an inquiry by principal secretary (power) S.K. Srivastava after surveying the blast site, while key functionaries of the unified command for counter-insurgency operations went into a huddle in the evening to review the situation.

 A source said heads were likely to roll in the police department because of repeated security lapses in the capital complex. A team led by an officer of the rank of additional superintendent and the Special Branch of Assam police are responsible for security within the complex.

 Inspector-general (Special Branch) Khagen Sarma said a programmable timer device was used to trigger the blast, which occurred at 2.40 am. The explosives were concealed in a soak pit adjacent to the Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Bhawan within the capital complex.

 Everest climber turns homeward

 Chandigarh: Sukhwinder Kaur, the 34-year-old mountaineer who had to abandon her climb to Mount Everest, is returning home to Muktsar on Wednesday. She has reached Kathmandu, reports our correspondent.

 Her insistence to carry on despite requests from her team leader had reportedly set alarm bells ringing in the mountaineering fraternity in Nepal. The Project Himalaya expedition website said despite the problems she faced after climbing above 7,400m, Sukhwinder was refusing to come down for fear of insult from her family.

 We have established contact with her twice since yesterday and she is coming back, a family member said over phone. 

 Sukhwinder had spoken to Paramjit, her friend and partner on various expeditions, twice since yesterday. 

 She is fine and there is no problem with her. She is also not feeling unwell as we were informed earlier. She also spoke today, a relative said. Her associates in Muktsar, however, said Sukhwinder has suffered frostbite.

 The climber will address the media on her return to Muktsar. There is a strong smell of foul play which only Sukhwinder can reveal. She has hinted that she could have carried on but for some inexplicable reasons was asked to return, the relative added.

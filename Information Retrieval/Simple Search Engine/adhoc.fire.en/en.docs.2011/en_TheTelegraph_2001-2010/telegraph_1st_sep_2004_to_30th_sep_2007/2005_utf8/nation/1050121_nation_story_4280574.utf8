 PC turns to party for budget

 K. SUBRAHMANYA 

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: P. Chidambaram, who presented what was described as a dream budget eight years ago as finance minister of the United Front government, will turn to his party for advise and support in a bid to repeat the feat. 

 On instructions from Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Chidambaram, who is in the midst of extensive pre-budget consultations with various sections of society, is scheduled to visit the party headquarters on Saturday for discussions with Congress leaders. 

 Sources said it would be the first time a Union finance minister would hold formal pre-budget consultations with Congress leaders. Chidambaram would be conferring with general secretaries, secretaries and office-bearers of the Congress parliamentary party, according to the sources. 

 The move to involve the party in a bigger way is in line with Sonia?s instruction to the Congress ministers soon after the formation of the United Progressive Alliance government last year to maintain close co-ordination with the party. In similar exercises in the past months, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil had held separate meetings with AICC office bearers. 

 The sources said the party functionaries would suggest to the finance minister how best to implement the promises made in the Congress poll manifesto, some of which might not have found mention in the UPA?s common minimum programme. 

 More important, said the sources, the finance minister could avail of the opportunity to win the party?s support for a definite push to the economic reforms programme. Sections in the party have often not been enthusiastic about the reforms and were vocal about it when the party was out of power at the Centre.

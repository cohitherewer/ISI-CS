 Hyderabad, May 6: Organic may soon be the flavour of the season, if Seelam Rajasekhar Reddy has his way.

 The IIM Ahmedabad graduate has set up the countrys first organic superstore, which promises to provide organic chicken, eggs and milk in a few months.

 Reddy gave up a cushy job in EID Parrys pesticide division to turn entrepreneur with Sresta Natural Bio-Products two years ago.

 The organic one-stop shop, named 24 Lettered Mantra, get its supplies from Sresta. It houses over 50 organic items, including natural sugar, cold-pressed edible oil, spices, rice, dal, flour, coffee, tea, jam, pickle and jaggery.

 ?Each of our products conforms to European and American organic production norms and has been certified by international agencies like Skal, IMO and ECOCERT,? said the middle-aged Reddy. All three are accredited organisations for inspection of organic products. While Skal and IMO are in Europe, ECOCERT is based in South Africa.

 Spread over 3,000 sq ft on the posh Road No. 12 in Banjara Hills, the air-conditioned superstore also has an organic caf? that serves organically prepared snacks and fruit juices.

 ?We are around 30 per cent costlier than the products in the market,? Reddy admitted, but argued that the prices seem reasonable if one considers the pesticides present in regular foodstuff.

 ?We have our own contract farming projects in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. We also work with organisations like ETC, a Dutch NGO, Morarka Foundation in Jaipur and the Uttaranchal Organic Commodity Board,? he said. ?Our supply chain is secure now. We have tied up with farmers and organisations to keep the flow of products for at least two years.? 

 He added that getting customers is not a problem. ?Word of mouth campaign keeps my shop crowded since morning.?

 An investment of Rs 2 crore has been made in the project. ?Our vision is to provide a life filled with sunshine, happiness, care, trust and humour,? said Reddy, who ventured into the organic business after his father died of cancer. Reddy said he also wanted to keep his children Harsha and Vivek away from the jelly and jam available in the market.

 Organic products are good for farmers, too, as they provide a natural balance for the soil and the eco-system, he said.

 He plans to open three or more small outlets here and superstores ?in Chennai, Bangalore and Pune to begin with, but we also have designs to go overseas?. All stores will have nutrition experts for counselling and clarifications.

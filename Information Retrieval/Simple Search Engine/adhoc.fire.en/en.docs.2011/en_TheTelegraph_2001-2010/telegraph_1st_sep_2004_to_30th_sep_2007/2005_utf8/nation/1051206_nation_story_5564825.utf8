 A Sea Harrier: To be upgraded 

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: A Sea Harrier fighter aircraft of the Indian Navy crashed during take-off in Goa today, killing its 30-year-old pilot, Lieutenant Commander H.P.S. Pannu. 

 Navy headquarters in Delhi has ordered an inquiry into the crash.

 The aircraft had completed a mission before Pannu was taking off on another. It left the runway in the middle of its run, crashed into a wall and took a tumble before landing in a field at Dabolim. 

 INS Hansa, the naval air station at Dabolim, is home to two squadrons of the Sea Harriers that also operate from the flight deck of the INS Viraat aircraft carrier. Dabolim airport was closed to traffic for about three hours after the crash.

 The British Aerospace-manufactured Sea Harriers were inducted into the navy between 1983 and 2003. The aircraft are due for a major upgrade.

 The navy has lost at least 10 Sea Harriers to crashes.

 The Sea Harrier that crashed today was a single-seater, indicating that the pilot was fully operational. INS Hansa is also a training base for Sea Harriers. 

 The aircraft in the training squadron are two-seaters. 

 The Sea Harriers are the only fighter planes with the Indian Navy.

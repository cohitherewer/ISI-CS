The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bid to carve secular front out of NDA

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Naidu: Taking the lead

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Telugu Desam Party has taken the initiative to bring together existing and former constituents of the National Democratic Alliance to form a secular front.

 The BJP and the Shiv Sena have been excluded from the effort which, the Desam hopes, would lead to the emergence of a third front.

 The Desams first step was to bring the Akali Dal, National Conference, Asom Gana Parishad and the Indian National Lok Dal together to evolve a floor coordination strategy for the ongoing session of Parliament. The leaders of these parties are expected to meet in the capital or Hyderabad after the session is over and plan their future moves.

 Akali leader Parkash Singh Badal, who was on a private visit to Hyderabad last week, dined with Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu after which he told reporters these regional parties will coordinate their parliamentary strategy.

 The Desam-inspired meeting agreed that these parties would support each other on region-centric issues. For example, they banded in support of the AGP on the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, the INLD on the Gurgaon violence and the Desam against the alleged victimisation of its workers by the Congress in Andhra.

 When the Akali Dal insisted that the government must table the Nanavati Commission report on the 1984 anti-Sikh violence but got no clear commitment, the Desam walked out along with the Akali members. The point to be noted is when the BJP took up the same matter earlier and walked out, we did not join them, a Desam source said.

 The common thread binding the formation, Desam and Akali sources said, was anti-Congressism.

 Barring the Akali Dal, which sources said was still undecided on whether to continue its alliance with the BJP or not, the rest have either sundered their links with the party or are on the point of doing so.

 The Desam, which has stopped attending floor coordination meetings convened by the NDA, will fight the Andhra local body polls on its own. We want to send a clear message that we will maintain equidistance from the Congress and the BJP, a source said.

 Sources said the loose, unnamed formation would try and work on other parties within the NDA and the Congress-led UPA to be part of it. The Biju Janata Dal will be shortly contacted but not the Janata Dal (United). The Dal is heavily dependent on the BJP for the Bihar polls in which its stakes are enormous, the sources explained.

 As for the Trinamul Congress, the sources said Mamata Banerjees stand was ambiguous and, therefore, she was not being approached just yet. She said in Bengal, I will contest on my own but, in Delhi, I will be with the BJP. So we dont know what to make of it, a source added.

 The Samajwadi Party, which supports the UPA from outside, is seen as a prospective ally in the near future.

 The Desam also counts the RJD and the Left as other future allies but does not expect their participation for some time. It was stressed that in the debate on Bihar in Parliament this week, the Desam made it a point not to attack the RJD, Ram Vilas Paswan and the Left but only the Congress.

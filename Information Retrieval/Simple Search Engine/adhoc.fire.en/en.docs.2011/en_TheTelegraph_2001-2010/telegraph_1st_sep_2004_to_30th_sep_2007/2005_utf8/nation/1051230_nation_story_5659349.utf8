 Missing girl calls home for money

 Kiron: Mystery deepens

 Krishnagar, Dec. 29: Four days after Kiron Adhikari disappeared, leaving home to go to an interview in Salt Lake, the IT graduate called up her father from Delhi last night asking for money.

 Mrinal Adhikari said Kiron sounded desperate. I am in deep trouble. I wont be able to tell you the details. But I have not been bodily harmed. Please send at least Rs 10,000 immediately to the bank account number I am giving you, she told her father.

 Mrinal refused, telling her that he would not send money to an unknown bank account. I told my daughter to return home and take the money from me.

 Fifty-two-year-old Mrinal, a technical officer at Eastern Railways workshop at Kanchrapara, said Kiron called up four times last night, the last around 9 pm. She told me she had sold her gold ring and her mobile phone to raise money to reach Delhi on December 25, Mrinal said, adding that Kiron did not give any further details.

 Mrinal told his daughter that her mother had suffered a cerebral attack after her disappearance last Saturday. Strangely, Kiron heard me out but did not respond as she should have. But I could perceive that she was trying to stifle a sob.

 He informed police and the CID about the development. The investigators checked the numbers and found that my daughter had called from Delhis Paharganj area. She changed PCOs four times, Mrinal said.

 District superintendent of police R. Rajshekharan said Delhi police were being contacted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Online buying for Diwali doubles

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: The Diwali cheer is spreading to the virtual marketplace as well. This festive season, Indians spent around Rs 115 crore buying sweets, gifts, consumer electronics and more? all with a few clicks of the mouse.

 According to a report by The Internet amp; Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), the online sales figure for the three weeks leading up to Diwali bettered that of last year by 117 per cent.

 Diwali sales also constituted around 10 per cent of the total online sales so far this year.

 This shows the increase in consumer confidence in shopping on the Internet, said Preeti Desai, president of IAMAI. A broad product selection and an ever-expanding range of unique and unusual gift ideas also helped the growth.

 Gift items topped the list of goods in demand. Besides gift packs of sweets and dry fruits, we sold a lot of ethnic wear and portable music players like the iPod, said Kaushik Bose of Koolbuyz.com, a Calcutta-based online seller which started operations just prior to Durga Puja. 

 The site received around a lakh hits during the Diwali season and sold goods worth Rs 4.5 lakh.

 Jewellery, apparel and consumer electronics items like DVD players, microwave ovens and cameras sold well on our site, said Gautam Thakar, a director of eBay India, the largest online marketplace in the country. Ebays Indian portal saw a surge of 15 to 20 per cent in the number of visitors during the period.

 Then there were some who mixed and matched gifts ? gifting sweets, coins and flowers or crackers with flowers ? for a more personal feel. Gift certificates and educational toys also proved popular.

 But if the mindset of the Indian shopper changed from brick-and-mortar to virtual, the last-minute scramble for the right gift carried on from the real world to the World Wide Web.

 Each festival season, Indians leave their shopping for the last minute and this year was no exception, Desai said. Gifts sold in the two weeks prior to Diwali comprised 61 per cent of total online sales compared to last years 54 per cent.

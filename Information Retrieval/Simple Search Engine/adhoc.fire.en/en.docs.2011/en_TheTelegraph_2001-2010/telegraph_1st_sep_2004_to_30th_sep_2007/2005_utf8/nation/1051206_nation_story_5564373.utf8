 SP drops ally over legislator murder

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulayam, Ansari 

 Lucknow, Dec. 5: With the BJP stepping up the heat over the killing of its MLA Krishnanand Rai, the ruling Samajwadi Party today distanced itself from Independent legislator Mukhtar Ansari, accused of plotting the murder.

 A day before BJP chief L.K. Advani is scheduled to visit Varanasi to join a protest march against the killing, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh said his party has no links with former don Ansari.

 The Samajwadi Party never gave a ticket to Mukhtar, he said. During behenjis (Mayavatis) rule, too, Mukhtar used to run a parallel government.

 Ansaris brother and Samajwadi Party MP Afzal Ansari, however, is a fellow accused in the murder, allegedly carried out by gangster Munna Bajrangi. Ansari, the Samajwadi Partys friend in need, is in jail custody after being accused of inciting the recent riots in Mau, his constituency.

 Singh told reporters that Ansari had been named in connection with the abduction and murder of Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Roongta in Varanasi, too, and the Samajwadi Party had been quick to issue a press statement against him.

 Both the Congress and BJP are taking Mukhtar Ansaris and Mulayam Singh Yadavs names together (and) blaming them for the murder of the BJP MLA so as to (make it) seem as if Mukhtar Ansari is as close to the chief minister as Shivpal Singh Yadav (Mulayams brother) is, Singh said sarcastically.

 Don-turned-Mahmudabad MLA Rai was murdered with six associates on November 29 on the Ghazipur-Ballia border, setting off a wave of protests across eastern Uttar Pradesh. Former BJP chief minister Rajnath Singh, who has been demonstrating against the murder since November 30 in Varanasi, has demanded a CBI probe.

 Hundreds of BJP supporters have thronged Varanasi to rally round Advani, who will join the freedom from fear agitation tomorrow. The date, December 6, is the 13th anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.

 The state government, under fire also from the Congress over its alleged links with Ansari, had initially toyed with the idea of conceding the demand for a CBI probe.

 The BJP wants a CBI probe and Mukhtar, who claims he is innocent, also asked for one, a Samajwadi Party think tank said. 

 The state government initially decided to kill two birds with one stone, but was later advised that it could put the government on the defensive.

 The Samajwadi Party now wants to bail the government out by getting Afzal Ansari to surrender in court in a day or two.

 Whenever any political murder occurs, the Samajwadi Party government promptly gets cases registered against the guilty and ensures that they go to jail, Amar Singh said. He cited the instance of Samajwadi MP Atiq Mohammad, who was jailed in connection with the murder of BSP MLA Raju Pal.

 Singh countered the criticism over the spate of political murders in the state by mentioning 13 political killings committed during the rule of the previous Congress, BJP and BSP governments.

 Political murders, by no stretch of imagination, are a Samajwadi Party legacy, the general secretary declared.

 At the Assembly today, the BJP again demanded a CBI probe into Rais murder.

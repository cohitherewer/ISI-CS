 I am not Vibhishan, says Uma

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 21: Uma Bharti has left her squabbles behind at home for a bigger battle in Bihar, but not before promising to return as chief minister. 

 The sadhvi said it was her intervention and persuasive skills that saved the Babulal Gaur government. If I had not stopped the BJP MLAs, they would have met the governor and brought down the government. But I did not want this, as this government is my child, she said. I am its mother. I will not allow its downfall.

 To stress her point further, Uma declared that she was no Vibhishan and would not set the BJP house afire. I live in Ayodhya and not Lanka. I will not set my own house on fire. I will never do anything to hurt my party, ideologically or otherwise, she declared, alluding to Ravans brother Vibhishan who had joined forces with Ram to defeat the king of Lanka.

 Uma, who till recently had refused to campaign for the Bihar elections, waxed eloquent on how her one-point agenda was to ensure the BJPs victory in the state. She will address a public function in Begusarai tomorrow.

 The sadhvi said that until November 18 ? when the polls come to an end ? she would not say or do anything regarding Madhya Pradesh.

 Then she posed for pictures with the BJPs Bihar prabhari (in-charge) Arun Jaitley to prove things were hunky-dory. 

 Uma, who is the saha prabhari (co-incharge), described Jaitley as her elder brother. My relationship with Arun is unique?. Since I am campaigning in Bihar, I have come here to seek his blessings.

 However, a bouncer came soon after. Uma said Jaitley had been witness to how she had refused the offer of returning as chief minister after she was cleared of the charge of instigating communal violence in Hubli. Why dont you confirm this for them (the journalists)? she prodded Jaitley.

 As the BJP general secretary turned crimson in embarrassment, his little sister giggled: See, how red his ears have become!

 In Bhopal, BJP circles are tense. Last night, at a dinner hosted by former Union minister Vikram Verma, Gaur, state BJP chief Shivraj Singh Chauhan and organisational secretary Kaptan Singh Solanki avoided bumping into Uma.

 Gaur and ministers loyal to him went into a huddle. Some of the firefighting measures adopted were a weekly interaction with party MLAs and a directive to bureaucrats to accord priority to the legislators recommendations. The chief minister said a month was a long time in politics and his experience would come in handy in tiding over the crisis.

 Military nurses fight to keep officer tag

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: Army headquarters is proposing to strip military nurses of their ranks as officers and take away the stars that distinguish their status. 

 The proposal has been made in a report by a committee appointed by the army chief and has been described by a spokesperson of the head of the Military Nursing Service (MNS) as illegal, illogical and unconstitutional.

 The MNS, a 3,200-strong all-woman unit, is common to the army, navy and the air force. It is headed by an additional director general of the rank of major general, an office currently held by Usha Sikdar.

 A lawyer speaking for the MNS chief who is contesting the army in Delhi High Court, P.D.P. Deo, alleged today that army headquarters had taken a policy of consistent disparagement, dishonour and derecognition of officers of the Military Nursing Service by stripping them of rank and replacing their olive green uniform with safari suits.

 The army is proposing to substitute the officer ranks with designations like sister, senior sister, deputy chief matron and chief matron.

 The lawyer said he was speaking for the MNS as armed forces rules bar serving military personnel from going public with their grievances. 

 Deo alleged that army authorities had gone public with the report even before the court and the petitioner had studied it.

 The case was filed by the additional director general, MNS, after a naval officer, Surgeon Rear Admiral V.K. Singh, currently the director general of the armed forces medical services, did not allow her to display star plates and flag on her official vehicle during a visit to the naval hospital ship, Asvini.

 The MNS spokesperson said the committee appointed by army headquarters submitted its report without consulting an independent panel and despite the dissent of the head of the nursing service. 

 The MNS contends that it is recognised as a part of the army under provisions of the Army Act.

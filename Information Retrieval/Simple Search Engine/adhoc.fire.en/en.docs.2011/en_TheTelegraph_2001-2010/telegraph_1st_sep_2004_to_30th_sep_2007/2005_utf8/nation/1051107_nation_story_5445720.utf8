 NRI cut to size

 New Delhi, Nov. 6 (PTI): Delhi High Court has ruled that a person cannot claim superior status by merely going abroad and that he would have to obey the orders issued by Indian courts.

 Dismissing the writ petition of Rajiv Tayal, who is facing a non-bailable warrant in a dowry case here, the division bench of Justices Mukul Mudgal and H.R. Malhotra said there was no infringement of fundamental rights.

 US-based Tayal had challenged the foreign ministrys order to impound his passport after being declared a proclaimed offender. He said he was residing in the US and subjecting him to criminal proceedings here would be an unfair burden on him and that he wasnt served summons. 

 The bench rejected his plea that to enforce Tayals presence in court violated fundamental rights. The acceptance of such a plea would give a premium to the petitioner who happens to travel abroad and it will be open to such an accused to misuse the law? it said.

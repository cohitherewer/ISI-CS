 Owners of sleaze caf?s in net

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 4: Police yesterday arrested five cybercaf? owners for allegedly showing clips of obscene movies downloaded from websites as well as full-length blue films stored in computers.

 Acting on a tip-off, a team led by Bhubaneswar superintendent of police Amitav Thakur raided 26 caf?s under Capital, Kharavela, Shaheed Nagar and Nayapalli police stations and caught five caf? owners ?red-handed?, while customers, including a few teenaged girls, were allegedly viewing obscene movies. 

 The police also seized six computers in the raid. According to the police, authorities of some cybercaf?s not only allow customers to surf pornographic sites on the Net, but they also store blue films in their computers with the intention of making copies and selling them.

 The police registered cases under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 7 of the Indian Cinematography Act. Though some customers were allegedly ?caught in the act? of surfing pornographic sites, no one was arrested.

 ?They just shut their computers down when we raided the cybercaf?s. We were able to arrest only the owners,? Thakur said.

 With Internet browsing becoming cheaper, cybercaf?s have becomed the favourite hangout of teenagers and adults alike in Bhubaneswar. When the police team ? along with two software professionals ? conducted the raid yesterday, most of the cybercaf?s were crowded.

 ?Many caf? owners do advertise their pornographic movies, but in a furtive manner,? said Rakesh Mohanty of Kanak Cybercaf? in the Kharavela Nagar area. 

 Despite the police action, caf? owners say it is impossible to keep an eye on customers, quite a few of whom are interested only in pornographic sites and films.

 Students in the capital, Cuttack, Berhampur, Sambalpur, Balasore, Rourkela and Kalahandi are known to indulge in ?caf?-hopping? in their search for the right place to surf adult websites without any trouble.

 In a related incident, Agra police last month raided a series of cybercaf?s, where 21 couples were allegedly found ?in a comprising position?.

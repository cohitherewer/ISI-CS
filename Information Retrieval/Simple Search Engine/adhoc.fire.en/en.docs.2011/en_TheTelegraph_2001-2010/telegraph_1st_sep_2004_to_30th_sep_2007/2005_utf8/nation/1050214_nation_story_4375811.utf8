 VHP joins Sena in cricket chorus

 Varanasi (PTI): The Vishwa Hindu Parishad 

 on Sunday joined the Shiv Sena, opposing the Pakistan cricket 

 team?s tour of India later this month. 

 VHP international general secretary Praveen Togadia told reporters that sports ties between the neighbours would serve no purpose as long as Pakistan continued supporting cross-border terrorism.

 abelling the proposed series a natak (farce), Togadia said: ?If Pakistan decides not to send its cricket team to India, the Hindus would welcome such a decision.?

 Criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board?s reluctance to send its team to Ahmedabad for a match, Togadia said it would be deemed as the victory of the Hindus of the state if the visiting team did not play at the venue.

 In Kanpur, meanwhile, eight Shiv Sainiks were arrested for allegedly trying to enter the Green Park stadium forcibly, police said today.

 The arrests were made in the last 24 hours following a futile attempt by the Sena activists to enter the stadium on Saturday. A one-day match is scheduled in the Kanpur stadium during the Indo-Pak series. Security has been beefed up in and around the stadium, police said. 

 On Thursday, Shiv Sainiks had tried to dig up a cricket pitch in Mohali.

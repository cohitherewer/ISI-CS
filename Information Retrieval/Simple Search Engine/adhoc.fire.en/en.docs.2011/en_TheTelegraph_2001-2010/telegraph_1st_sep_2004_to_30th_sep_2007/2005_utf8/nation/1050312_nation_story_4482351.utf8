 Dhanbad girl tops IIM race 

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, March 11: A 22-year-old girl from Dhanbad, set to graduate from the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow, topped campus placements and bagged a job in a foreign bank.

 Udetanshu will work as finance consultant at HSBC-1 Bank, London, for an annual salary of $72,000 (Rs 31 lakh). 

 A few notches behind her was Calcutta boy Pankaj Patwari, who will join McKinsey and take home a pay packet of Rs 14 lakh.

 The institute?s campus placement committee today announced that all students of the Class of 2005 have got good jobs in prestigious companies both in the country and abroad. 

 ?There were 331 offers made to 219 students.... These included 13 international offers,? said R. Srinivasan, chairman of the committee. 

 ?Final placements this year saw a number of consulting firms like McKinsey, BCG, Accenture, Deloitte Consulting, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst amp; Young visiting the campus, and 40 students were recruited by these companies as compared to 12 last year,? he added.

 Udetanshu, who will be posted in London, was showered with praise at the institute. A teacher described her as ?among the most outstanding? students.

 The girl from Dhanbad graduated from St Stephen?s College in Delhi with honours in mathematics before joining IIM-L. Her specialisation at the institute was in marketing finance and operation.

 Twenty-four-year-old Patwari was a chartered accountant before enrolling here. ?IIM-L built in us a personality besides imparting knowledge. It became smooth after that to face interviewers from top-notch companies,? he said.

 Sources at the institute said this year?s batch has got, on an average, 10 per cent higher salaries than last year. ?IIM-L continues to attract the best organisations in the banking and financial sectors,? said a faculty dean. 

 Sex abuse probe

 The report of a two-member internal committee has held an IIM Indore professor guilty of ?workplace harassment? and said the ?possibility of sexual harassment cannot be ruled out entirely?.

 The report, which was released to the media yesterday, had been sent to the human resource development ministry and the National Commission for Women on January 25 for appropriate action.

 The committee in its report submitted to the institute on December 17 had said the accused had been making advances to an employee of the institute for some time.

 ?As far as the professor is concerned, direct evidence is not available. In fact, in such a situation, direct evidence is rarely available,? it said, adding that 10 employees had spoken about his indecent behaviour with women.

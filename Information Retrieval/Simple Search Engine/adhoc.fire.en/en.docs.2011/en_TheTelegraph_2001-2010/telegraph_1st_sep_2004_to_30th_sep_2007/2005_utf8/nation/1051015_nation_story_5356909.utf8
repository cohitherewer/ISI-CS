 Party ties Advani hands on Uma

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: L.K. Advanis plans to reinstate Uma Bharti as Madhya Pradesh chief minister or reinduct her in the BJP as a general secretary ? as the second option? have run aground after opposition from his former acolytes and loyalists.

 The inside story of the BJP presidents resurrect Uma blueprint has emerged in bits and pieces through a letter dated October 9 which the sadhvi wrote to RSS sarsanghachalak K.S. Sudarshan and information trickling in from BJP sources as well as those close to Uma.

 In her letter, Uma claimed Advani described himself as a non-functional party president when he informed her that she would be sent back to Madhya Pradesh as chief minister only after the Bihar elections. When she asked him why after the elections and not right away, he reportedly said: I am a non-functional party president. Whatever others say, I have to do. The RSS does not want me to do this.

 Uma referred to an undated meeting at A.B. Vajpayees residence with some MLAs from Madhya Pradesh to which she and state unit chief Shivraj Singh Chauhan were invited. The perception in the party for long was that chief minister Babulal Gaur would be replaced by either Uma or Chauhan, with the latter having an edge after the run-ins Uma had with BJP and RSS leaders at various points.

 Asked if she would be the chief ministerial candidate, Uma reportedly said she would not, but would choose a person. Vajpayee, Advani and Jaswant Singh together reportedly insisted it would be Uma or no one else. M. Venkaiah Naidu, with whom she has had a running battle for the past year, said a decision would be deferred till a meeting of senior functionaries which was held on October 8.

 According to one account of the meeting, Advani said he wished to reinduct Uma and induct Varun Gandhi as general secretary. Of the six posts, as only one was vacant, it was proposed that general secretary Om Mathur (RSS nominee) would be kicked upstairs as vice-president. 

 When Naidu and Pramod Mahajan pointed out that Uma had publicly humiliated Advani and them and was unrepentant, they were told she had apologised to Advani. But what about us? they asked.

 Naidu and Mahajan had the support of Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Sanjay Joshi. Sensing the gang-up, Advani, according to Umas letter and independent sources, threw up his hands. 

 However, when he reportedly used the RSS as a shield, Umas letter made it plain that it was not the entire organisation but Suresh Soni, the general secretary in charge of the BJP, who wanted to scuttle her return to Bhopal.

 Uma asked Sudarshan why, as the chief, he could not rein in Soni, accused of micro-managing the BJP in the state. With the letter in the public domain, the Uma camp suspected it was leaked by a section of the RSS to do her in.

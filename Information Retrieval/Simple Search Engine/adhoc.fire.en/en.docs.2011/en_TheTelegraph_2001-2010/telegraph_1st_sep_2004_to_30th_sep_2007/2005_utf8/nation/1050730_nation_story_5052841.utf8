The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bollywood works double

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 29: Fresh sets, new schedules and juggled dates ? Bollywood was raring to return today, having lost crores in the deluge that rocked Mumbai between Tuesday and Thursday.

 If Amitabh Bachchan gave two extra days for Kaun Banega Crorepati and promised to shoot dugna (double) to compensate for the days lost, film crew prepared for nightlong schedules to make up for the money wasted.

 Theres still a lot of water outside Mr Bachchans house in Juhu but he has confirmed to start shooting for KBC from Sunday, was the word from STAR TV. 

 He has also given us two additional days on Monday and Tuesday and will be shooting for extra hours to provide the required amount of software, with the show going on air on next Friday (August 5).

 Having waited all of Wednesday to hear from boyfriend John Abraham, who waded through the waters to return home, Bipasha Basu faced the camera this afternoon for Sonys talent hunt show Fame Gurukul, which featured her as a celebrity judge.

 The move-on mantra was spelt loud and clear as drowned sets were overhauled and arclights turned on. Films like Kalyug, starring Emraan Hashmi and Deepal Shaw, and the Kumar Sanu-produced Utthaan, starring Priyanshu Chatterjee and Neha Dhupia, were slated to be shot for long hours tonight.

 So much money has been lost due to the disruption in shooting that only non-stop shoots can salvage the situation to some extent, said Priyanshu. 

 Shootings of biggies like David Dhawans Shaadi No. 1 and Ravi Chopras Babul were also held up. Those who couldnt resume today promised to get rolling by tomorrow. 

 The television serials have not been that lucky, though, with the Sakinaka landslide happening very close to the sets of many a daily soap. 

 ...Now there can be a serious crisis in readying enough software, said a television analyst.

 While men behind and front of the camera waited anxiously for the lights, camera, action call, there were others like music directors Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy, who waited for their computers to dry up. 

 We were working at the Empire Studio in Andheri which was in the basement and was completely flooded because of the rains. While we didnt lose any data, our desktops and guitars went under water. We can only start working once the machines are dry, said Ehsaan Noorani.

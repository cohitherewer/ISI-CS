 Adams at risk in Meerut mall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Aug. 6: Eve-teasing has gotten routine. How about Adam-teasing?

 Twenty-somethings Anju, Reena and Sonia were caught last night reclining on their bikes and drawing the attention of male passers-by near a Meerut mall by mouthing the choicest of obscenities. The better-looking and more smartly-dressed ones even had a taste of being physically chased by them.

 A police patrol doing the rounds of the medical college police station area of Meerut, about 400 km from here, spotted the trio at their unusual calling, leaving men squirming and scampering to safety.

 Initially, the girls ? Anju and Reena are from Delhis Patelnagar and were visiting relatives while Sonia is from Meerut ? were content with chatting among themselves but gradually got on to juicier things. 

 They seemed too foul mouthed and we had to arrest them because they were creating a bad scene on the street at 11.10 in the night, said Alka Agarwal, a sub-inspector on the patrol team. The three were produced in court today and remanded in judicial custody.

 When told what their offence was, a stunned subdivisional magistrate asked: They were doing what?

 The public prosecutor replied: Teasing Adams, sir, on the street.

 Stung Murthy vacates airport drivers seat

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Oct. 20: N.R. Narayana Murthy has walked out of the Bangalore International Airport project after his contribution was questioned, in a move that industry sees as a blow to the citys reputation.

 In a letter to chief minister Dharam Singh today, the Infosys boss pointed to reports of your coalition partner, Mr Deve Gowda, speaking to the press about lack of my contribution to the Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL) during the last five years.

 I wish he had asked me personally before going to the press, or talked to you or ascertained it from members of the board. I am disappointed that a former Prime Minister did not accord me this basic courtesy, he added. 

 The letter was delivered to the chief ministers office in the afternoon and released by Infosys an hour later.

 At a news conference on October 16, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda had said: Narayana Murthy has been Bangalore International Airport Ltds chairman for five years. Why did it take him so long to get it moving? Murthy has travelled all over the world. He should be able to come up with a plan to decongest Bangalores traffic.

 Narayana Murthy was non-executive chairman of the Rs 1,500-crore project ? a public-private partnership of the state government, Airports Authority of India, Siemens, the Zurich Airport Authority and Larson amp; Toubro. The new airport coming up in Devanahalli, about 30 km from here, is to become operational in early 2008.

 The resignation letter did not spare Singh. I am pained, more so, that leaders in the government like you did not even clarify my role in the company and the work that has been done. 

 I have spent enormous amount of time and energy in interacting with the government in New Delhi and the government here to make this work. The records prove themselves. Therefore, I am resigning from the chairmanship of BIAL effective Thursday.

 The chief minister quickly launched a damage-control exercise. I have received the letter this afternoon. I will call him and persuade him to withdraw the resignation. I will talk to him and convince him, he said. Narayana Murthy is in the US now.

 Albert Brunner, CEO, BIAL, acknowledged Narayana Murthys efforts in prodding the project past various agencies and said he would try and convince him to stay on.

 Putting up a brave face, the chief minister said: The resignation will not prove a setback for future investments. Against all odds (because of the coalition arrangement), investors have come to Karnataka. The industry (information technology) has contributed 45 per cent of the exports.

 However, the industry thought otherwise. These are initial signs of wrecking. A news of this magnitude will have an impact on all public-private partnerships. This will hit Bangalores image as the IT hub and a good destination for investments, said Anant Koppar, the president of the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce and head of Mphasis Ltd.

 C.N. Kumar, the convener of the Bangalore Forum of Information Technology (BFIT), echoed him. Even the faintest hope is gone. Bangalores image will be hit hard.

 The infotech industry has of late been complaining about the lack of civic amenities in the city. Member firms of both the chamber and the forum had threatened to keep away from the states flagship event, BangaloreIT.in, scheduled later this month in protest against poor infrastructure. They called off the boycott after a meeting of company CEOs with Dharam Singh on September 22 in which he promised to spruce up the silicon hub.

 On October 15, Singh and Deve Gowda sat through a presentation by Narayana Murthy on urban planning. 

 The day after, the former Prime Minister released copies of his letter to the chief minister on the proposed allotment of 800-odd acres to Infosys on the outskirts of the city. 

 Deve Gowda charged the industry with launching a whisper campaign against the coalition government on poor civic amenities in Bangalore and said IT companies were grabbing land for subsequent real-estate deals.

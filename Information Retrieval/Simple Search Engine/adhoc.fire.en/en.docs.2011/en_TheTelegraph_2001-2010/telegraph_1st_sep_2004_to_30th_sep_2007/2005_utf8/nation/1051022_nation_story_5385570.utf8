 Drug trial records in public eye

 Hyderabad: An effort is on to set up 

 a registry of records of all clinical trials of medicines 

 underway in the country, reports our special correspondent. 

 The data of all ongoing clinical trials would be placed in public domain for better awareness and monitoring, Aswin Kumar, the drug controller-general of India, said. 

 In the post-patent law regime, nearly 200-300 studies and 100 phase-II and phase-III multi-centre clinical trials are on in India. 

 Kumar said regulations have been imposed to make licensing and permission essential to conduct clinical trials in India. 

 Kohli order on hold

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 restrained a lower court from passing the final order on 

 the British governments plea for extradition of Maninder 

 Pal Singh Kohli.

 The prime accused in the schoolgirl Hannah Fosters rape and murder case had challenged the lower courts rejection of his plea to summon 10 witnesses from the UK.

 Kohli had sought reversal of the order on the ground that the right to defend is provided to a person facing extradition proceedings.

 He allegedly murdered the British teenager in London in March 2003 and then fled to India. 

 Kohli was arrested in Kalimpong in Bengal.

 New Delhi (PTI): Air Sahara has announced 

 introduction of eight new flights, primarily connecting 

 Chennai, Bangalore and Calcutta to Delhi.

 Among the new flights are one between Delhi and Chennai and another between Delhi and Calcutta. The flights will be launched in October.

 Mock emergency

 New Delhi (PTI): A full emergency was 

 declared at the Indira Gandhi International Airport on Friday

 exercise. Sources said it was carried out to test the response 

 of the emergency services.

 hoping to emigrate to the US are likely to get another opportunity

 been snapped up in record time. The National Museum in New 

 Delhi has launched a 75-minute audio pack-age in five languages

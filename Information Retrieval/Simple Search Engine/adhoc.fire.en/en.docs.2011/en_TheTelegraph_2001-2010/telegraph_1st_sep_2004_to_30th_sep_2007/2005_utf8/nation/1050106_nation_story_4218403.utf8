 Poser on Bihar station strike 

 GAUTAM SARKAR

Lakhisarai, Jan. 5: Yesterday?s Naxalite attack 

on security personnel at Kajra railway station could have been avoided had the 

district administration acted on the advice of state intelligence agencies.

 In a similar incident last year, Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) activists had looted weapons after raiding police and railway stations at Simultala in neighbouring Jamui district. The intelligence agencies had sounded an alarm after the incident, warning police teams posted in the remote areas of the region to prepare themselves for more such attacks.

 Inspector-general of the Government Railway Police (GRP), Amrik Singh Nimbran, admitted that activists of the erstwhile MCC were responsible for yesterday?s attack, adding that the incident could have been avoided if the district authorities had heeded the intelligence department?s warning.

 The IG has initiated a probe into the attack and urged the superintendents of police of Munger, Jamui and Lakhisarai to help the GRP conduct raids. 

 According to him, a group of armed Naxalites, including more than a dozen women, attacked Kajra railway station around 2.15 pm yesterday and held the stationmaster captive before attacking the policemen. The rebels assured passengers and railway employees that they would not harm them. 

 The group snatched five SLRs, one revolver and more than 500 cartridges from the injured policemen. Dilkush Kumar, a havildar, sustained serious head injuries and was admitted in Jagadamba Seva Sadan at Surajgarh block in Lakhisarai. The other policemen who sustained injuries were Anil Kumar Rajak, Sarjug Ravidas and Harendar Kumar Roy. The police are yet to arrest anyone. 

 Superintendent of railway police (Jamalpur), K.K. Verma said the Naxalites boarded a train to Kiul after the incident. But eyewitnesses said they headed for the nearby hills after looting the weapons. The police had recovered some cartridges from a nearby hilltop.

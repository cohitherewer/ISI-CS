 PM steam for Laloo rail 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today approved the Rs 24,000-crore grand modernisation plan of railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, two days before the elections in Bihar.

 The amount is to be utilised over five years and spent on introducing high-speed passenger and freight trains.

 The approval will form part of the railway budget to be presented in Parliament later this month. The ministry will get Rs 4,800 crore (each year for five years) in addition to the annual plan of Rs 14,495 crore proposed for the financial year 2005-06.

 A Railway Board member said: ?A presentation was made to the Prime Minister today by a team led by the chairman, Railway Board, R.K. Singh, with details of the modernisation plan. The proposal already had the approval of the Planning Commission. The Prime Minister was very appreciative of the targets and promised support.?

 Laloo Prasad had unveiled the modernisation plan last December promising to change the face and the pace of Indian Railways. The blueprint is a mixture of a few new ideas and the strategies of his predecessors. It proposes two semi-high-speed trains that will run at 150 km per hour. Most trains now run at 70-100 kmph.

 The first train will be between Delhi and Howrah via Patna and is expected to be on track by 2007-08. The second will be between Delhi and Chennai and is expected to be ready by 2009-10. Both projects will be completed at an estimated cost of Rs 2,672 crore. 

 The railway plans to raise part of the money for the revamp on its own. Laloo Prasad is also hoping to persuade the government to come up with extra budgetary support of Rs 10,270 crore, which works out to around 42 per cent of the overall cost. This could be a tricky area as the finance ministry has been insisting each department should find its own resources to fund new plans. 

 Laloo Prasad also proposes more Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains, which run at 160 kmph. These will have facilities like web surfing and mobile telephony, environment-friendly hi-tech toilets, large windows and longer coaches that seat more passengers. 

 About 8,000 coaches with zero-discharge toilet system similar to that used in airlines will also be made during the next five years. 

 A separate scheme is planned to create a high-speed dedicated passenger track on which trains will run at speeds of 250 to 300 kmph. The railway has said the first high-speed train will be between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.

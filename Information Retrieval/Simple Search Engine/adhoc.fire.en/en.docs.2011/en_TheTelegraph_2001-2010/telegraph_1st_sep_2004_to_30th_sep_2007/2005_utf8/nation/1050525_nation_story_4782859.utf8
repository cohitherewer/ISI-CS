 Experts burst health bubble

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 24: Pointing to loopholes in the national rural health mission ? one of the governments most ambitious projects ? experts have described it as old wine in new bottle.

 They are sceptical that the mission, which aims to provide healthcare to millions of villagers, may meet the same fate as hundreds of other schemes pushed by the Centre. 

 We are happy that the government is giving some thought to rural health, that is certainly positive, said Meera Shiva, a public health expert. However, there are several flaws in the mission plan.

 Shiva and others like Anant Phadke of the Pune-based Centre for Enquiry for Health and Allied Themes, are worried about funding. They point out that although the increase in the health budget for the financial year 2005-2006 ? in the range of Rs 6,700 crore ? seems a considerable amount, there has been some financial jugglery to arrive at the figure. It includes funds forwarded by international agencies for Reproductive and Child Health (RCH), they say.

 What happens when the RCH programme is over and the funds from international donors stop? Phadke asked. He said he was doubtful the UPA government would be able to live up to its promise of increasing the outlay on health from 0.9 per cent of the GDP to 2-3 per cent.

 At the heart of the rural health mission is the role of the Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) ? a female health worker with a medical kit, offering basic drugs, advising women on childbirth and taking care of infants and treating common ailments like diarrhoea, dysentery and fever.

 But the status of women in large parts of the country could be a stumbling block. The recent case of Shakuntala Verma, an employee of the Madhya Pradeshs women and child welfare department whose hands were chopped off allegedly for campaigning against child marriage, proves how vulnerable women are in the countryside.

 An accredited activist will be selected by panchayats, which will pay her a token stipend. The rest of her earnings will be in the form of a small fee for helping villagers. The panchayats will decide how much she will be paid.

 The women will be trained for 23 days, spread over a year. 

 Although their role is well defined in the health mission plan, their performance will depend on several other factors. 

 How well do panchayats in this country run? Very often, in the villages, panchayats are totally controlled by the sarpanch.? In this situation, it is difficult to foresee Asha being able to function effectively, said Imrana Kadir, an expert on community health.

 Shiva said unless Asha is supported by doctors and other staff in the health department, she cannot achieve much. Asha will be in the lowest rung of the health hierarchy. In most cases, women in villages are treated with disdain. I wonder if the men in the health chain will give her the support she needs. 

 According to Phadke, health authorities want activists to have at least studied till the seventh standard. But, she added, it will be near impossible to get such women among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. So in most cases, Asha will be from the upper castes and may not agree to work with lower-caste women. The education qualifications will have to be adjusted according to the needs of the region, Phadke said. 

 However, experts are keeping their fingers crossed that the health mission will be fine-tuned in the future and made effective.

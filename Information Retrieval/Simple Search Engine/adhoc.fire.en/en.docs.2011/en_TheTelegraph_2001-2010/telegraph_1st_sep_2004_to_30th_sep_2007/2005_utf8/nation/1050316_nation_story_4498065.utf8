 New Delhi, March 15: Indian and British army troops have set up a temporary joint staff headquarters for a peace enforcement exercise near Hyderabad. 

 The exercise, which began on March 10, will continue till March 22.

 Integrated defence staff personnel from India and joint staff from the UK have made ?Emerald Mercury? the largest India-UK joint military exercise. From India, the exercise involves elements from the army, the navy and the air force.

 Defence sources in New Delhi said it was a ?planning exercise? based on a fictitious UN mandated peace support operation.

 The sources said the exercise flows from the joint declaration signed by the Indian and UK Prime Ministers in September last year and is ?evidence of commitment to reinforce the strategic partnership between the two countries.? 

 Before the exercise, the UKs joint warfare training centre conducted a joint operational planning

 Patna, May 22: Security was suddenly beefed up and all roads leading to the Raj Bhavan were sealed today as political uncertainty gripped the Bihar capital.

 An officer of the Rapid Action Force said at least four companies of his battalion deployed in Jamshedpur had been asked to move to Bihar while more than two dozen companies of the Central Reserve Police Force were also being deployed in the state, most of them in Patna.

 Chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanian confirmed the sudden security beef-up but did not say what necessitated the step.

 Bihar has been under Presidents rule and its Assembly in suspended animation as none of the parties have been able to come together to form a government after the elections earlier this year.

 In a fresh twist to events yesterday, the BJP-Janata Dal (United) combine conceded that it had facilitated the stay of 13 MLAs of Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party at a resort 13 km from Jamshedpur.

 A senior NDA politician said todays arrangements could be a precursor to a recommendation by governor Buta Singh to dissolve the Assembly. 

 Earlier, Lok Janshakti legislator Munna Shukla, a key player in effecting the split in his party, said a government under the Dal (U) could be comfortably formed. Shukla said at least 128 MLAs would support a government led by Nitish Kumar. The majority mark is 122. 

 Shukla was counting the Independents and those from smaller parties like the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party. He (Paswan) still has time to support a government led by Nitish Kumar.

 Earlier in the day, Lok Janshakti MP Suraj Bhan flew to Delhi with three MLAs. He said the total number of MLAs in Delhi has gone up to 10 and two legislators lodged in jail had also pledged support to Paswan. More people will come very soon. Our MLAs are being kept captive in Jharkhand.

 The unprecedented security has sparked speculation hinged on two theories. First, that the administration could be fearing a backlash if the governor recommends dissolution of the Assembly and second, the governor could invite non-NDA parties to form a government in Bihar.

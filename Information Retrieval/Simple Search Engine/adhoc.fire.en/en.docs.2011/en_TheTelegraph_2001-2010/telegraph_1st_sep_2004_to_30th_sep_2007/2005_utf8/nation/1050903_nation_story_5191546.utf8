 Cloud on Kurien for defying court

 Ahmedabad: K. Pratap Reddy, who was sacked 

 as director of the Institute of Rural Management, Anand, 

 has filed a petition against Verghese Kurien, alleging that 

 the founder chairman has not allowed him to function despite 

 Gujarat High Court reinstating him.

 On Thursday, the last day of Reddys tenure, Kurien had formed a three-member committee to carry out the duties of the director even as eight of the 11 members of the board of governors, including representatives of the government, signed a circular extending Reddys tenure by three months.

 However, when Reddy reached his office on Friday morning, armed with the court order reinstating him as director, he found it locked.

 The petition, to be heard on Monday, wondered how Kurien could appoint a committee and defy the court order that held the chairmans decision to sack the director null and void.

 Cracker bar to stay

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has refused 

 to relax the bar on bursting crackers after 10 pm for Ganesh 

 Chaturthi, the 10-day festival beginning next week.

 The bench dismissed a petition by the Maharashtra government requesting the court to extend the deadline to midnight.

 Let Ganesh Chaturthi be celebrated peacefully this year, the court said. In a July 18 judgment, the court had ruled that crackers could be burst during festivals and other occasions only between 6 am and 10 pm. It had also fixed sound levels for loudspeakers in public places and places of worship. 

 Oman route

 New Delhi (PTI): Marking the golden jubilee 

 of Indo-Oman ties, archaeologists and navy personnel from 

 the two countries will set sail from Sur in Oman to Bet 

 Dwarka in Gujarat, retracing a 4,000-year-old trade route.

 A replica of the bronze-age Majan boat will carry dates, dry fish and copper vessels, besides urea manufactured at a fertiliser plant set up jointly by India and Oman in Sur.

 Clinton for UP

 Lucknow: Bill Clinton will arrive 

 in Lucknow on September 7 for a meeting with the Uttar Pradesh 

 Development Council to explore the possibilities of investment 

 in the state, according to panel chairman Amar Singh.

 Film fest in Goa

 New Delhi (PTI): Goa will be the 

 permanent venue for the International Film Festival of India 

 (Iffi), according to an agreement signed between the directorate 

 of film festivals and the Goa government here on Friday. 

 The 10-day festival begins on November 24 with an array 

 of international and Indian films. 

 Two trespassers were shot dead by guards of the closed Bharat Gold Mines complex in the Mysore mines area on Friday. A crowd of 25 had thronged the complex for remnants of gold ore.

 Advani amp; turf on chopping board

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, July 31: The BJP is upset that it may lose two prestigious Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat on the delimitation commissions drawing table.

 But one of the seats being Gandhinagar ? L.K. Advanis turf since 1991 ? the state BJP also sees a silver lining: a chance to distance itself from the former deputy Prime Minister, who has become unpopular in the Sangh after praising Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

 The commission wants to split the Ahmedabad constituency into two, both reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates. Gandhinagar will lose most of its Assembly segments to adjoining constituencies and acquire new ones whose caste composition would go against the BJP.

 At least this will be a legitimate excuse to get Advani out of Gujarat, a source said. There is no way he can find another seat in the state because we ourselves are not keen on it and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Vishwa Hindu Parishad will ensure he loses.

 Party leaders recalled how, in 1998, the Sangh had ensured the defeat of Shankersinh Vaghela, who was still in the BJP, from Godhra to a Congressman because he had dared to take on Advani (then a favourite), Keshubhai Patel and Narendra Modi.

 So, if push came to shove and the party had to accept an altered Gandhinagar, it might do so somewhat willingly, sources said.

 The 14-member commission, which has five MPs and legislators from Gujarat, will meet on August 12 to take a decision.

 BJP leaders such as Kashiram Rana, Vallabbhai Katheria and Harin Pathak (all Lok Sabha MPs) say that if Ahmedabad is reserved for the Scheduled Castes and Gandhinagar loses its white collar voters to be taken over by the Patels and Kshatriyas, the BJP will have a tough time. 

 Barring Dalit voters, the rest will not be enthusiastic about voting in Ahmedabad, a leader explained. Thats the reality of Gujarat ? its so casteist.

 Gandhinagar, the state capital, has government employees as its core population. With no caste or religious group to be wooed so far, Advanis nationalist image, cultivated during the Ram temple agitation, used to go down well with its voters.

 The BJP argues that a mofussil seat could be reserved for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, represented by heavyweights in the past, will lose their pride of place on the countrys political map if they are reserved or transformed into casteist seats, it says.

 Police hunt for top dog

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 8: A four-year-old kidnapped from the heart of the city is bad enough for polices image. But when the captive is a member of a former bosss household, its time for some desperate sleuthing.

 The only comforting thought is that the VIP hostage is unlikely to have been harmed. Compared with your usual four-year-old, he is rather strongly built and can take care of a couple of adult humans on his own.

 Former city police commissioner M.V. Krishna Rao has lost his pet Alsatian. A team of six constables and a reserve assistant sub-inspector has, therefore, fanned out across Hyderabads narrow lanes, eyes peeled for suspicious characters with a dog on a leash.

 Rao, who now heads the State Road Transport Corporation, says Bheema II (named after his first Alsatian, Bheema, which died a year ago) has been missing since December 1.

 My dog went out to relieve himself as usual, his police complaint reads. My cook let him out but Bheema did not return as usual.

 The Sanjeev Reddy Nagar police station has started a case under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code against unknown persons for enticing a dog/cat with eatables with an intent to steal it.

 We have the dogs photograph and have set up a search team, said inspector A. Venkatratnam.

 Raos personal staff said he had gone off food completely after the dogs disappearance, but has resumed eating. 

 The former police boss, who has two other dogs, both Labradors, told reporters in a broken voice: Banda and Bubbly are my only solace now.

 Both Rao and SR Nagar police have announced rewards of Rs 2,500 for information on the dog or his delivery. News reports on the cash awards have appeared in local dailies.

 Officers couldnt recall ever having to investigate missing pets before. But government doctors had to face a Telugu Desam ministers fury over an injured pet in the 90s.

 The then education minister P. Ananda Gajapathirajus wife Uma Gajapathi Raju (now married to Romesh Sharma of New Delhi Times fame) had ranted at doctors of the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences for refusing to treat her pet deer cub.

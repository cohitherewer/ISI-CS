 Question mark on Bihar elections

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: The Bihar elections are hanging in balance.

 The Supreme Court today allowed two petitioners to file separate applications to make the Election Commission a party respondent in the Bihar Assembly dissolution case.

 The counsel for the poll panel, S. Muralidhar, has been served a copy of the applications and asked to respond earliest by Monday. 

 Depending on the ECs reply, the Supreme Court will decide whether to allow or stop the poll process in the state.

 Todays applications are significant in light of the challenge to the Bihar Assembly dissolution by Supreme Court lawyer Viplav Sharma and Independent MLA of the dissolved House Purnima Yadav.

 There are six petitioners in all. Of them, four belonging to the NDA have challenged governor Buta Singhs report and the dissolution.

 Today, Sharma and Yadav sought an interim stay on initiating electoral process as no court can interfere once the election dates are notified. The petitions challenging the dissolution would then become infructuous.

 The court asked the petitioners counsel, Harish Salve, if the applications had been filed. Salve said they had been and Muralidhar had been given a copy.

 Constitutionally, once the election process is ignited by the EC through a notification on poll dates, no court can interfere. Petitions challenging the dissolution will then become an academic exercise. But if the petitioners succeed, the way will be clear for revival of the dissolved Assembly.

 If elections are held before that, there will be a problem as a new Assembly would be in place. This situation should be avoided, Salve argued.

 The petitioners counsel also contended that he had an additional point of law on the constitutional aspect of a governor having to first invite a party or group, pre or post poll, to form the government and leave it to the legislators to prove the majority or the opposite and then recommend for dissolution and no recommendation to dissolve a nascent Assembly without even having it convened.

 Sharma then contended that Buta Singh should be made a party respondent. Salve said there was a constitutional bar on making a governor a respondent.

 The court had earlier issued notices to Buta Singh but recalled them as the aspect of constitutional bar was not considered at the time of issuing the notices. But the court today observed that the aspect of making a governor a party to the case of this nature could be examined. 

 If the court stays the EC from going ahead with the polls, it will be the first time such a pre-emptive order is issued. If the governor is included as a party, it would be a first in Indias constitutional history.

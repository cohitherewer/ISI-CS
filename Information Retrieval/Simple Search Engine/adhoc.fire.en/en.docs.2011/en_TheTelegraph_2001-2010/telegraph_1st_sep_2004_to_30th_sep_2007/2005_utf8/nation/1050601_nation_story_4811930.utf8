 Condom with milk to fight AIDS 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, May 31: Feeling shy to ask for a packet of condoms at the local chemists? Take a transfer to any Andhra town.

 You could get it with the morning newspaper. Or the milk pouch the neighbourhood milkman leaves at the doorstep every day. Even the man who sells vegetables could slip in a pack or two.

 Before you think it is some kind of an indecent proposal, here are the facts: nearly a million people in Andhra Pradesh are HIV positive while 10,000 have full-blown AIDS even after the state government and other agencies have spent nearly Rs 250 crore to contain the scourge.

 With 13 per cent migrant labourers, one of the most vulnerable groups, and a high promiscuity rate in society, the government is using every channel to spread awareness about the killer disease. One can reach almost 80 per cent of the population every morning through these traditional routes. It is only a question of social acceptance (of such measures). We think the time has come to give it a serious thought, says chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy.

 In Andhra, only 19 per cent people use condoms against the national average of 41.

 According to a report of the state AIDS control society, 27 per cent of men and 15 per cent women are known to have non-regular sexual partners. The national average is 16 per cent men and 4 per cent women. Maharashtra and Bengal top in promiscuity levels.

 The move to distribute condoms through newspaper, vegetable and milk vendors has come in the wake of a recent survey by the National AIDS Control Organisation which revealed that there is only a hairline difference between Andhra and Maharashtra, presently the crown prince of AIDS.

 At a high-level meeting yesterday, Reddy gave the go-ahead for an intensified action programme ? AASHA (Anti-AIDS Sustainable and Holistic Action) ? from July 1.

 The state government has also suggested introducing AIDS and HIV awareness lessons in the curriculum from Class IX. That is the right age, the chief minister said, to warn adolescents about unhealthy sexual practices.

 Another plan is to introduce compulsory AIDS-prevention programmes at workplaces like quarries, construction sites and call centres. The programme would also cover transport sector employees and tourist areas.

 Earlier measures like supplying free condoms with liquor did not work. Promiscuous sections of society do not come to liquor shops or bars, says the report. 

 Asked if the new initiatives of the state government would succeed, health secretary I.V. Subba Rao said: It is just another stone in the darkness. We will be happy if it hits. It will save lots of lives.

 The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Catholic Health Association of India have joined the state government in its efforts. Over 172 NGOs are also working to combat AIDS.

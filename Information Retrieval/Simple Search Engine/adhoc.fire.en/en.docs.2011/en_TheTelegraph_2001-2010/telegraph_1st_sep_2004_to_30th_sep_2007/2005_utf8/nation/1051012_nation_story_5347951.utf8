 Return buzz around Uma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: With Uma Bhartis acolytes projecting her as one of the BJPs star campaigners in Bihar, speculation has resumed on her future after the Assembly elections.

 The question being asked is: will she be inducted as a general secretary or reclaim her job of Madhya Pradesh chief minister?

 BJP president L.K. Advani, who is on a public relations trip after Chennai, is reportedly keen to bring Uma back into the party organisation as a general secretary. She was believed to be cut up with him for not restoring the chief ministers post to her after a Karnataka court had cleared her of the charge of instigating a communal riot.

 One of Advanis critics in the party already seems keen to make up with him. Delhi BJP veteran Madan Lal Khurana called on the party chief today, saying all his grievances had been addressed and he was ready to work with Advani again. 

 Khurana had waged a long-drawn battle against Advani and was seen as a catalyst in the developments that led to the BJP chiefs decision to quit office in December.

 The news of Khurana softening up and the possibility of Uma getting back into the BJP mainstream met with curiosity and scepticism in the party.

 It is totally baseless. No decision has been taken (on Uma), said general secretary Arun Jaitley. He questioned reports suggesting that a meeting of the general secretaries, chaired by Advani, had decided to send Uma back to Bhopal.

 Only one of the general secretaries, Sanjay Joshi, attended the meeting, which discussed the brewing revolt against Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje. Jaitley himself was in Patna.

 Sources close to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh questioned Advanis authority and locus standi to effect high-level changes in the party organisation when he had a little over two months left as BJP chief.

 This can mean only one thing: that despite the announcement in Chennai, he has no intention of leaving and wants to reassert his position before the party and the Sangh. Else, why should these reports appear? a source asked. 

 The functionaries said that if changes had to take place, they would happen after December. The Sangh is keen to change not only the man at the helm but his entire team, they said. Some high-profile members of Advanis team are under the Sanghs scanner.

 Although current Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur has run up his share of problems within the BJP and the government, the sources said that if he has to be replaced, state party chief Shivraj Singh Chauhan would be a more probable choice than Uma. He is young but mature and, like Uma, is from a backward caste, a source said.

 Sources close to Uma said her stakes are as high in the Bihar polls as those of some of the leaders more directly involved in it. Uma has been billed as the BJPs backward caste response to Laloo Prasad Yadavs enterprise of crafting a Muslim-Yadav axis.

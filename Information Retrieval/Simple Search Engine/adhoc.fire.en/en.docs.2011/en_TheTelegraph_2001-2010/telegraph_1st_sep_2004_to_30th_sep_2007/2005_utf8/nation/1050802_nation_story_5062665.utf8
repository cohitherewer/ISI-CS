 Warm-up for Bihar D-day 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: Amid clear indications from the Election Commission to sources in the BJP and Janata Dal (United) that the Bihar polls will be held between November 20 and 22, the NDA and the Rashtriya Janata Dal have begun warming up for D-day.

 If the NDA was fishing for issues, the RJDs endeavour was first to ensure the Congress stayed with it, and second, to try and soften up Ram Vilas Paswan and the CPI.

 Aware that the five-month central rule had deflected attention from Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi and dimmed memories of his 15-year misrule, BJP sources said they would evolve a strategy to bring the RJD chief back on Bihars political centrestage.

 Otherwise we will be groping in the dark, conceded a Bihar MP.

 So, rather than let the spotlight be on governor Buta Singh, the BJP began alleging the controversy over the transfer of police officers ? including the Siwan SP ? which led to chief secretary G.S. Kang proceeding on long leave, was Laloo Prasads handiwork.

 When the Assembly was kept in suspended animation, the governor was Paswans puppet. Once it was dissolved, he became Laloo Prasads puppet. Our charge is that the transfers were ordered by Laloo Prasad.

 For the last 15 days, (RJD MP) Shahabuddin has been travelling freely in Siwan and his bodyguards, who were withdrawn by the police, have been restored after the SPs transfer, alleged Bhagalpur MP Sushil Modi in a press briefing.

 Claiming that law and order was just as terrible as it was under RJD rule, Modi said the RJD, Congress and Left were equally culpable.

 His other charge was Laloo Prasad was already flouting the Election Commission norms ? although the model code of conduct is enforced only after election dates are announced ? by going on a publicity binge. He said Laloo Prasad recently inaugurated a milk-vend at Patna railway station and spent a lakh on the ad campaign, though the kiosk itself costs much less.

 An NDA delegation, led by BJP president L.K. Advani, called on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam this evening and demanded the governors recall.

 Advani told reporters: We told the President we do not recall any state where the chief secretary has lodged such a protest. Since the administration was being run in his (the Presidents) name, his intervention is essential.

 RJD sources dismissed the NDAs protest as a political nautanki (drama) and said its priority was to see that the alliance with the Congress and CPM stayed put.

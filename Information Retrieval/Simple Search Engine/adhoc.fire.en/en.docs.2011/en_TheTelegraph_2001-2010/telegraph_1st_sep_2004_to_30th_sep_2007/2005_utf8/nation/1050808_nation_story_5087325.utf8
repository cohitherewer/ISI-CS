 ATM ad row back in glare 

 New Delhi, Aug. 7 (PTI): The Supreme Court has questioned if illuminated signboards atop ATMs amounted to advertisements by banks, making them liable to pay licence fees to municipal authorities.

 It has asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to decide this question afresh in a case involving ICICI Bank.

 The apex court gave the order while setting aside a Bombay High Court order holding that illuminated signboards atop the ATM centres of ICICI Bank amounted to an advertisement for which payment would have to be made.

 Till 2000, ICICI Bank had set up ATM centres and extension counters at 64 locations in Mumbai and fixed illuminated signboards to indicate their location to customers.

 The BMC did not approve this and issued notices saying the bank should have taken permission before putting up the signboards and making the required payment.

 The bank approached the Supreme Court saying the signboards atop the ATM centres were a location guide to customers and not advertisements.

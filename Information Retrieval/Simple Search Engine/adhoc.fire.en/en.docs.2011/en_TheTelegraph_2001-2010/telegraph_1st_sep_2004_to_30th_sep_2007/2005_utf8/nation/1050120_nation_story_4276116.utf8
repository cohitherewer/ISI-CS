 Rejig, minus magic wand

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Jan. 19: Rahul Gandhi has promised a revamp of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh but warned party workers he does not have a magic wand.

 Before lighting the campfire last night at the end of the two-day training meet for youth leaders at Chitrakoot, 350 km from here, the Amethi MP said suggestions thrown up at the brainstorming session would be acted upon immediately.

 ?I can assure you, there will be major changes in the party set-up soon, especially the district Congress committees. I and Salman (Khursheed) heard your suggestions,? Rahul told the delegates. He left for Delhi later in the night.

 ?Youth Congress leaders will be given the chance to work their way up to the higher levels of the party and their interests will be looked after,? the first-time MP said. 

 But he warned: ?Don?t think everything will be easy just because I am working with you. I don?t have any magic wand.Youngsters should come up. Normally, young people snatch everything they don?t get easily. You have to put in your best here to snatch things that don?t come easily.?

 State unit chief Khursheed and general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh Satyavrat Chaturvedi are believed to have been instructed to be in constant touch with Rahul. 

 Chaturvedi said the district bodies would be revamped soon. The party will decide a yardstick for ticket distribution. Fifteen districts will be taken up, where party bodies will be changed in line with the suggestions at the camp. These groups will then line up workers down to the polling booth level.

 Delegates pointed out to Rahul the stagnation in the party set-up. ?A culture of appeasing the leader rather than the party has been a major stumbling block in the Youth Congress? Young Dalit leaders have found themselves alienated,? said Vijay Bahadur Singh, a Dalit leader, as Rahul listened and took notes.

 Hindu symbol on UK stamp

 AMIT ROY

 London, Nov. 1: The Royal Mail has delighted Hindus celebrating Diwali in Britain by issuing a Christmas stamp inspired by an Indianised version of the Holy Family.

 The 68-pence stamp, which will come in useful when sending seasonal greeting cards to India in December and January, is based on a picture, dated between 1620 and 1630 AD, which hangs in a Mumbai gallery, the Royal Mail said. 

 The image is an Indianised version of a European print of the Holy Family with St Anne and the two angels. It features a man with a tilak on his forehead, identifying him as a Vaishnav, while the woman has the traditional kumkum mark on her forehead to show she is a married Hindu woman. Both are worshipping the baby Christ.

 A Royal Mail spokesperson added: It was common for Hindu artists during that period to paint images that depicted western culture, including paintings about Christianity. The stamp simply features a Hindu artists interpretation of Christianitys Madonna and Child scene.

 The spokesperson said the Royal Mail, which received 6,000 requests every year for special stamp issues, was happy to look at all suggestions received.

 There has been one protest over the stamp but this seems an isolated case.

 A Gujarati newspaper editor said: We saw the stamp a month ago but thought there was nothing to worry about. Its not like putting Hindu images on toilet seats. We think most Hindus will be very pleased with the stamp.

 Hindu icons are now so popular with westerners that a tee shirt with the Om symbol is a must have for many university undergraduates. The Devnagri script has also been appropriated by manufacturers of fashionable fabric. And Krishna has a big following in Britain, even though people may not quite appreciate the deeper meaning of his message.

 Boost for Kurien 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, June 28: Gujarat High Court today upheld the sacking of K. Prathap Reddy as a director of the Institute of Rural Management at Anand ? made famous by the milk cooperative Amul ? by its chairman Verghese Kurien.

 The high court upheld Kuriens authority to sack the director, overturning the April 20 interim order passed by a single-judge bench, which had termed the chairmans order unlawful.

 When contacted, Kurien, known as the father of the milk revolution and pioneer of the co-operative movement in the country, said: Satyameva jayate (truth always prevails).

 The ruling came as a rude shock to Reddy, who said he would consider moving the Supreme Court.

 Faction rivalry in the IRMA had led to the sacking of Reddy, who was seen to be supporting Amrita Patel, chairperson of the National Dairy Development Board and a one-time prot?g?-turned-rival of Kurien.

 Patel has been locked in a conflict with Kurien for some time over Amuls marketing practices.

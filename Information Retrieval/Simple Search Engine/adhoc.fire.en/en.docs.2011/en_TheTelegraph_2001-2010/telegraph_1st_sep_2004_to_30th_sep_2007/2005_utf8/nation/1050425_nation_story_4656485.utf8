 Guwahati, April 24: Monpa country in Arunachal Pradesh, it is said, is God?s own land and nothing symbolises the exotic tribe better than the Tawang monastery, nestled in the lap of the Himalayas.

 Now, this incredibly beautiful terrain of snow-clad mountains, deep river valleys and enchanting plateaus will come alive in the first-ever feature film in the Monpa dialect of Arunachal Pradesh. To be shot in the exotic locales of Dirang, Sepa, Tawang and Top Hills, the film ? titled Sonam ? is based on folk tales narrating a yak-rearer?s life.

 The film?s director, S.N. Mazid, is already in Arunachal Pradesh for shooting the lifestyle of the Monpas.

 Nuruddin Ahmed, who has designed nine sets for the film, said, ?I have stayed and studied the life and customs of the community and have artificially recreated their lifestyle in my sets. We had also visited the National Research Centre on Yak to get more information on the endangered species.?

 ?The Monpas construct their houses with stone and wood, often with plank floors, carved doors and window frames. The roof is made with bamboo matting. Their living rooms have sitting platforms and hearths,? he added. ?The influence of Buddhism on Monpa textiles, ornaments and architecture is very strong. They are artistic and excel in floral designs.? Ahmed said.

 The Buddhist monastery at Tawang is at the heart of Monpa life and is a treasure-trove of more than 700 Buddhist scriptures.

 The music for the film will be composed by flautist Dipak Sarma. 

 Sarma had earlier composed music for a Mising film, Jonki Panei.

 ?I had played the tunes of a Tibetan monk?s mantra in a CD called Healing Hearts. Now I am listening to several Tibetan tunes so as to compose music for the film,? Sarma said.

 Referring to the tribal society of Arunachal Pradesh, Ahmed added, ?There are several tribes, each having its own social structure. These tribes were unable to maintain contact with each other thanks to lack of communication.?

 Frowns on seat deal

 K. SUBRAHMANYA 

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Backroom strategists of the Congress are pleased that a tie-up with Laloo Prasad Yadav has not materialised in Bihar, but believe their party has made avoidable concessions to Shibu Soren in Jharkhand. 

 In its pre-poll assessment of the ?ground realities? in the two states made on the basis of field visits, the party?s department of policy planning and coordination is understood to have presented convincing reasons against a formal Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal alliance. 

 The assessment, conveyed to president Sonia Gandhi late last month as separate reports on the two states, says the ruling RJD is unpopular among almost all sections of the people, particularly the Muslims. The community, which constitutes over 15 per cent of the electorate, holds the key in as many as 70 Assembly seats.

 ?The Muslims are looking for an alternative to the RJD. They are looking to the Congress to provide that alternative. There is an opportunity for the party to revive its base across Bihar,? said a source. 

 However, the strategists are not impressed with the unofficial decision to field nominees in about 80 of the 243 Assembly seats in Bihar or with the party?s reluctance to forge a formal tie-up with Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party. 

 ?Such an alliance would have surely had a chance of being viewed as an alternative to the unpopular RJD. Besides, we could have fielded candidates in a majority of the seats,? the source said. 

 The planners are not surprised with the findings of the pre-poll The Telegraph-STAR News-AC Nielsen survey published today. ?The finding that a formal alliance of the Congress-LJP would adversely affect the poll prospects of the RJD and the BJP-Janata Dal (United) combine confirms our recommendation to the leadership,? one of them said. 

 If Sonia campaigns extensively for such an alliance, the outcome could shock rivals as she has become the most popular leader since giving up prime ministership, they said. 

 If they are gloating about Bihar, the tacticians are displeased with the Jharkhand deal and are cribbing about too many concessions to Soren. They had suggested that the party ?must go in for an alliance with the JMM? but were clear about contesting 45 of the 81 seats. 

 They had cautioned that an ?unpredictable? Soren could be lured to the BJP with the bait of chief ministership if his party won around 25 seats. They are thus perplexed with the decision to leave the single largest share of seats to the JMM. 

 Sonia?s political secretary Ahmed Patel spoke to Soren today on seats, but only to request exchange of five constituencies between the allies. The request follows threats from leaders like former state party chief Thomas Hansda that they would quit if their respective seats were not given to them and allocated to the allies.

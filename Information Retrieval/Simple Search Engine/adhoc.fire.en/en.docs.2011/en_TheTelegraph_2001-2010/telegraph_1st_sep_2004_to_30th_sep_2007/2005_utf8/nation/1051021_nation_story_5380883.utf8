 Calcutta, Oct. 20: All eyes will be on Doordarshan again when the Sri Lankans and South Africans battle Team India in 12 one-day internationals from next week.

 Just as it had done before Indias last home series in March, against Pakistan, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) today decided to award telecast rights for October-Novembers back-to-back ODI series to Doordarshan.

 India plays seven ODIs against Sri Lanka, starting October 25, and five against South Africa, starting November 16.

 The marketing committee felt that in order to reach out to the largest possible Indian audience, the national broadcaster would be the best possible option for the Indian terrestrial and cable rights, BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra announced after the boards marketing committee met in Calcutta today.

 Prasar Bharati, which manages Doordarshan, had offered Rs 7 crore per match but raised it to Rs 7.5 crore after further negotiations for the exclusive rights.

 The production for the two series would be done by TransWorld International (TWI). The production cost quoted by TWI was $1.54 million (Rs 69.30 crore) for 12 matches while the quote of Nimbus Sport was $1.95 million (Rs 87.75 crore). Since there was a difference of Rs 18 crore-plus, the committee decided on TWI, Mahendra said.

 Nimbus, however, alleged the amount it had offered was not the final one. We had also requested BCCI for sealed bids, but they did not do anything, Harish Thawani, chairman, Nimbus Sport, said.

 For the overseas rights, the BCCI president and other marketing committee members have been authorised to negotiate with the prospective parties.

 Todays meeting was not attended by former president I.S. Bindra and N. Srinivasan, perceived to be in the opposing camp of the ruling body.

 Prasar Bharti, which will show the matches on the national network and its satellite channel DD Sports, plans to make Rs 10 crore per match from advertisement revenues.

 The board informed Delhi High Court ? which is hearing a petition filed by Zee Telefilms seeking quashing of BCCIs invitation to tender? of its decision.

 Zee counsel Harish Salve argued that the arrangement flouted an assurance given by the board to the court that it would not grant the TV rights pending the petition filed by Zee. The court asked the board to file by Saturday an affidavit giving details of the decision, and fixed the next hearing for Monday.

 The cricket body also told the court that it had opened the technical bids ? as allowed by the high court earlier ? and found Zee Telefilms to be ineligible to participate in the financial bidding for the telecast rights.

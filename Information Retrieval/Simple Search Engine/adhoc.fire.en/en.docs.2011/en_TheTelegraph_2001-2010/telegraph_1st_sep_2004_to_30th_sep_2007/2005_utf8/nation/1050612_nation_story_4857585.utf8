 Pataudi seeks time, cops keep up heat

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Chandigarh, June 11: Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and six others accused of killing a black buck today sought time till June 15 to appear before Haryana police, but the force continued its raids to arrest them.

 Despite police summons, the seven co-accused have not appeared before them for investigation after they were caught with the carcasses of a black buck and two rabbits in a Gypsy at Jhajjar, 65 km from Delhi, last week. There were eight people in the car only one of whom, Madan Singh, has been arrested.

 In a communication to Jhajjar police, the accused ?who have been charged under the Wildlife Protection Act ? have sought four more days, saying the police notice had been served at their residences in their absence.

 But Jhajjar superintendent of police Hanif Qureshi said: He (Pataudi) will be arrested soon. We have sent teams to places where we think Pataudi and the other accused are hiding.

 A Jhajjar court on Thursday turned down an anticipatory bail application moved by one of the accused, Shashi Singh, citing lack of jurisdiction. Singh was asked to approach the environment court at Faridabad.

 We think Pataudi may file for anticipatory bail in Punjab and Haryana High Court or at the special environment court in Faridabad, said Ashok Kumar, director, Wildlife Trust of India. Our lawyers have been alerted and we will be opposing the bail application if it comes up.

 However, as the judge hearing cases related to the environment is on leave till Monday, it is likely that the application will be moved next week.

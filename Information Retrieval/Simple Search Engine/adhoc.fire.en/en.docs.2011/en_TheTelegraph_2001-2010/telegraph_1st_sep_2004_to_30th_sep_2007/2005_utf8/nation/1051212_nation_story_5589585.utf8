 Industry woos Left brigade

 (Top) Karat, Agarwal: 

 In new mode 

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: Industry bodies in the country have opened their own channels of communication with the Left leadership, a clear indication of cosying up to them for discussing key economic issues.

 This week, the top brass of Assocham held a meeting with CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and confabulated on several contentious economic issues, including airport privatisation and foreign direct investment in retail.

 We had a candid and personal discussion with him. Importantly, he was not against FDI in manufacturing but disagreed with us on the issue of allowing FDI in retail as he felt it was not the most appropriate step, Assocham president Anil Agarwal said.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee attended meetings organised by the Ficci, another influential industry association, in quick succession in the last one month.

 On FDI in retail, Agarwal said, perhaps a little more reasoning was required from the part of the industry.

 After the United Progressive Alliance assumed office last year, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury and CPI leader D. Raja had addressed industry captains under the aegis of Assocham.

 The Assocham chief said the Left is important not only for us but for the whole country. We are now requesting (CPI leader) A.B. Bardhan for addressing us in January.

 Bhattacharjee, in a recent Ficci meeting, said the Left was in favour of private capital for economic advancement but opposed to unbridled globalisation that compromised on the countrys self-reliance.

 The Bengal chief minister had also sought to allay fears that the CPM-led state government was against infusion of private capital. We need private capital ? domestic or foreign. Without foreign direct investment, we just cannot advance, he said.

 Industry leaders said the talks with the Left have become necessary in the changing political climate, especially regarding issues like labour laws, FDI in retail and job privatisation.

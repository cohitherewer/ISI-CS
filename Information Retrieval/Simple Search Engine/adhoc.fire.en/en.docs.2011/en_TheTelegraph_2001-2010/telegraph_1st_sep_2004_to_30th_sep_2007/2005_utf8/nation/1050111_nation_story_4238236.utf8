 Arjun toys with private college leash

 Arjun Singh: Another scheme 

 Bangalore, Jan. 10: Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh today held out a promise on regulations for private professional colleges to protect the interest of students.

 Singh spoke of a mechanism to regulate admissions and the fee structure of these institutes to facilitate access for a wider section, while inaugurating a two-day conference of education ministers. Such a mechanism, he said, would also address issues such as regional imbalance in the spread of such institutions and mobilisation of resources for higher education.

 ?Many state governments have been demanding that a legislation be enacted on admissions and fee structure in private professional colleges. The Government of India will take steps on the basis of a national consensus before the next academic session starts so that we can translate the consensus into actual implementation schedules,? Singh said.

 The minister said the state would retain its hold on education as its withdrawal would benefit neither the country nor the private sector and invited suggestions for a regulatory mechanism for private and foreign universities and the norms for admissions and fee structure in these institutions.

 ?The questions of private and foreign universities, fees and admissions are to be considered and discussed in the backdrop of these larger issues. We must remember that in the field of education, it is not possible to work out only technical solutions. Education is part of the wider political economy and initiatives in education are possible within this political economy as a whole,? he said.

 Karnataka called for a set of parameters to ensure quality.

 ?Privatisation of education cannot be done without strengthening the government?s role as provider, regulator and facilitator. While entering into educational trade agreements, care should be taken to keep our cultural, economic and social needs in mind, and encourage the creation of a society which emphasises on social justice and values of cultural and religious diversity,? said chief minister Dharam Singh.

 The chief minister recalled the anxiety of students awaiting admission to professional colleges. 

 ?Our attempt should be to ensure that the maximum percentage of seats in all professional colleges are earmarked for meritorious candidates. We owe it to our young people to set up a system which enables smooth passage into the portals of higher education,? he said.

 Karnataka, according to official sources, would propose a draft legislation during the conference to overcome problems that might arise while discussing admission and fees with private professional colleges.

 The conference will also discuss a seat-sharing formula in private professional colleges, subsidies for SC/ST students and new guidelines while signing MoUs with foreign universities.

 Ministers of 20 states, as well as representatives of the University Grants Commission and the All India Council for Technical Education will provide inputs for a national consensus on a regulatory mechanism.

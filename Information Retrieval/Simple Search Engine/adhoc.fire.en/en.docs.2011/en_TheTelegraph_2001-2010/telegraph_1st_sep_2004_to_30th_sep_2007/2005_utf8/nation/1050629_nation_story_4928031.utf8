The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Capital catches Calcutta fever

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 28: Blooded in Calcutta, it is time to cut teeth in the capital.

 The Left today took its once-patented ? and now widely cloned ? brand of protest politics to Delhi. Between 700 and 1,000 protesters demanding a rollback of the oil price rise pushed aside barricades, squatted on the roads and jostled with police, causing traffic snarls, before water cannons were brought out. 

 The number was small ? the Lefts rally fodder is still largely confined to Bengal and Kerala despite its newfound clout at the Centre ? compared with protests held by other parties from time to time. But on Action Day, the capital got a taste of the nuisance the Left can cause.

 Activists shouting slogans and carrying placards that said Take back petrol, diesel price hikes and Government, come to your senses hit the streets as part of a nationwide campaign, some of them in trucks.

 The agitation started peacefully but the protesters, expected to march to the Prime Ministers Race Course Road residence, appeared restless even as the CPIs D. Raja, the CPMs Brinda Karat and the RSPs Asim Ganguly were addressing them.

 Soon enough, they broke through police barricades at the busy ITO intersection in central Delhi and spilled over to the other carriageway of the road on which morning rush hour traffic was moving. Several activists lay down or squatted on the road and had to be dragged away by the police.

 Struggling to control the crowds, the police called for water cannons which were used at least twice. This angered the protesters further and they jostled with the policemen. 

 The police later allowed the activists to march in a procession through the nearby Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg for some time before they dispersed.

 Addressing the protesters, Raja said: If sales tax, customs duty and excise duty are reduced in Delhi, a litre of petrol will cost only about Rs 17 and not at around Rs 40 (as) at present... If you think that oil is a revenue-generating product, you are wrong Manmohan Singhji, Chidambaramji.

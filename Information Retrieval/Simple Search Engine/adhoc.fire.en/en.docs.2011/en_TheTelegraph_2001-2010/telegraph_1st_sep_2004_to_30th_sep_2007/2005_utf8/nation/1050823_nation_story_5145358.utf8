The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cockney

 The BBC Voices project involves a weeklong series of programmes on national and local radio to celebrate the way people speak around the UK in the 21st century.

 Dr Laura Wright, senior lecturer of English Language at Cambridge, said the Cockney accent is not disappearing altogether but instead shif-ting to outlying towns and boroughs around the capital.

 Many inhabitants were transferred out of London to the newly-built New Towns, such as Basildon and Harlow, she explained. 

 Professor David Crystal, a BBC Voices consultant and one of the worlds leading language specialists, said the shift in accents was part of the increasing cultural diversification in the last 50 years. 

 Accents are a reflection of society and as society changes so accents change, he said. In Cardiff Ive heard a number of accent mixes that werent previously heard before such as Cardiff-Hindi. This pattern is repeating itself in many urban communities across the UK, especially where people are keen to develop a strong sense of local identity.

 MCA test

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: The human resource development ministry today dismantled yet another system introduced by former minister Murli Manohar Joshi: an all-India common entrance test for computer courses.

 ?The government has now decided to dispense with the All India MCA Common Entrance Test with immediate effect,? the ministry said.

 States will continue to hold their own common entrance tests for computer courses in the institutes. ?Private institutions may join the respective state-level tests or hold their own tests,? the ministry said.

 In its order scrapping the all-India entrance test for computer courses, the ministry said: ?All the central/deemed universities may conduct their own entrance examination and admit students in a fair and transparent manner.?

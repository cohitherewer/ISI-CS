 Kotla courts more trouble

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 14: The Ferozeshah Kotla is in trouble again, this time drawing a spot of criticism from the Delhi lieutenant governor.

 ?We are not fully satisfied...We have to still improve on a few areas,? B.L. Joshi said during an inspection of the stadium that will host the final one-dayer between India and Pakistan on Sunday.

 Also hosted will be Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf who will be accompanied by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, his predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

 Long queue for bus pass

 Srinagar, March 21 (PTI): People today waited for hours in long queues to get permit forms for the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service at the regional passport office here braving incessant rain and a mild lathi-charge.

 Men and women were seen waiting in separate queues since this morning to get the forms to travel on the historic bus service.

 Police had to resort to lathi-charge to control the crowds outside the passport office, officials said.

 The passport office had distributed 150 forms in the state on March 4 to shortlist 60 people for the first two trips across the border.

 Around 500 forms have been distributed today at various counters in the state, regional passport officer John Shilshi said. About the increase in the forms issued, he said the government has decided to issue 500 forms at various places covering all the districts of the state because of the eagerness shown by people to visit their kin across the border. 

 Duly filled forms would be taken back shortly and those approaching the passport offices in time would be given priority, Shilshi said.

 Asked whether the Pakistani authorities had handed back the list of 60 persons selected to travel in April, he replied in negative. The exercise to check credentials and other details of the intending visitors was time consuming, he said.

 ?We have issued the forms well in advance to give enough time to the investigation authorities on both sides to complete the formalities,? he said.

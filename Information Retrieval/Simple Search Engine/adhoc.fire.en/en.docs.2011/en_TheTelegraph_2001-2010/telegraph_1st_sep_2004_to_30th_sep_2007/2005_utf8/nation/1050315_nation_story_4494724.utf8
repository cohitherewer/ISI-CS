 Patna, March 14: Tension is running high at a remand home for children in Muzaffarpur following alleged police excesses on the inmates yesterday.

 The children were protesting against irregularities in the home when the police lathicharged them, injuring at least three inmates and a couple of journalists.

 Deputy superintendent of police Ramashish Ram today denied handcuffing or assaulting any inmate of the remand home. 

 The inmates, about 75 in number, today demonstrated in front of the police for almost an hour.

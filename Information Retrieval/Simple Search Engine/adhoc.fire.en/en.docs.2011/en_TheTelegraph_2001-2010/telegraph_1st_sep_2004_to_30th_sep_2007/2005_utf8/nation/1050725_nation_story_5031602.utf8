 Fuel or reactors: Experts split 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 24: After decades of self-reliance, Indias nuclear establishment appears to be at the crossroads, eyeing possible import of nuclear fuel and reactors to meet what some experts say are unrealistic nuclear power plans.

 Senior nuclear power experts have said any US action to help India import nuclear fuel and reactors would be crucial to meet the Department of Atomic Energy plan to produce 20,000 mw of nuclear power by 2020.

 The emerging Indo-US equations on nuclear matters have generated a debate on whether India should import nuclear fuel alone or reactors too.

 Import of reactors will make India dependent on unfamiliar technology and make us go begging for fuel throughout the lifetime of the reactors, said Adinarayana Gopalakrishnan, the former chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.

 However, one nuclear technology expert, who requested anonymity, said it is time that India re-examined its frozen position on reactors.

 Experts fear that without fuel or reactors, Indias nuclear power curve may begin to dip in 10 years. With 14 operating reactors and eight under construction, nuclear power capacity is expected to rise from about 2,700 mw now to about 8,000 mw by 2010.

 Indias installed wind power capacity of 3,500 mw now exceeds nuclear power production. 

 Except for two US-made reactors in Tarapur and one in Rajasthan, all operating reactors are based entirely on indigenous research efforts. The department of atomic energy has been unable to import nuclear fuel or technology for decades because of sanctions against India, prompted by its nuclear test in 1974. 

 Nuclear power experts estimate that Indias reserves of natural uranium will support 10,000 mw of nuclear power. While uranium deposits have been detected at sites in Andhra Pradesh and the Northeast, efforts to mine the mineral have failed to take off. 

 Analysts estimate that the shortage of natural uranium would affect even existing nuclear power reactors. 

 The 20,000-mw target assumes that India would build at least eight more home-grown pressurised heavy water reactors and import six light water reactors (LWR) that are technologically a bit different from the indigenously-developed heavy water reactors.

 Gopalakrishnan said Indian nuclear scientists and engineers are thoroughly familiar with heavy water reactors but not with light water reactors that will come with different designs, fuel handling systems and safety features. 

 They will need to retrain themselves to work with LWRs, he said. 

 The light water reactors use enriched uranium as fuel and India would have to import this throughout the lifetime of the reactors. Its like buying a foreign car for which we have to import the fuel all the time, Gopalakrishnan said. 

 However, one nuclear expert argued that the light water reactors are more popular than the heavy water ones. 

 Light water reactors are dominant across the US and Europe. Canada and India are among the few countries that use heavy water reactors. Its time for some rethinking, the expert said. 

 Some nuclear scientists said imported LWRs would allow India to expand nuclear power capacity for short-term energy needs over the next 15 years. Two 1,000-mw Russia-made reactors, now under construction in Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, are also LWRs. 

 But Gopalakrishnan said LWRs would not be able to feed plutonium into fast-breeder reactors that represent the second phase of Indias nuclear power programme envisioned decades ago by the late Homi Bhabha. 

 The plan aims at making India self-reliant on nuclear fuel by gradually moving towards a third phase that will exploit the countrys vast reserves of thorium in coastal Kerala. Imported LWRs would not move us closer to that goal in any way, Gopalakrishnan said. They would merely foster dependency.

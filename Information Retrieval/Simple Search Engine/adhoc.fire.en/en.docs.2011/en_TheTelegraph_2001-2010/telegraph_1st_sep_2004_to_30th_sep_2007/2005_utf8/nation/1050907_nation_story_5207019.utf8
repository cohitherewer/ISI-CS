 Nathu La trade to miss deadline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: India and China are likely to overshoot their October deadline to start border trade at Nathu La. Indications are trading might begin only by mid-next year.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao had set October as the deadline when the latter came calling in April this year.

 Chinese ambassador Sun Yuxi said the process had been delayed by insufficient infrastructure and non-existence of proper roads on the Chinese side.

 Once the border trade starts, it could reach anything between $500 million and $1 billion in no time, Sun claimed.

 The ambassador said experts from the two countries would soon meet to decide on customs and immigration and other related issues. 

 China is keen to restart trade not only at Nathu La but at other traditional posts also, he added.

 Restarting trading at Nathu La is not only about enhancing commerce between the two countries. 

 If and when it begins, it would also be an official recognition by China that Sikkim ? Nathu La happens to be part of that state ? is an integral part of India. 

 Till recently, China had refused to recognise this.

 During his April visit, Wen had brought a copy of the new official map of China that showed Sikkim as a part of India.

 The trading volume between the two sides is worth over $14 billion. 

 The ambassador said that given the way it was increasing, trade volume might touch $20 billion by the end of the year.

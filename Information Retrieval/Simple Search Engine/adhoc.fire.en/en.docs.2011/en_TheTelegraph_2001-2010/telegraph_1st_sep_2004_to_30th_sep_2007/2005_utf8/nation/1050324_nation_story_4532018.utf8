 Centre shelves fixed term for secretaries

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, March 23: A controversial proposal that sought to give the home and defence secretaries a fixed two-year tenure has been given a quick burial for now.

 An unclear legal opinion and an internal assessment that suggested some retired and serving bureaucrats could move court against the proposal prompted second thoughts in the Prime Minister?s Office, which decided to junk the plan.

 The proposal ? first mooted early last year ? was widely believed to have been timed to appoint the information and broadcasting secretary, Navin Chawla, as the Union home secretary. If the rule is not changed, Chawla would retire when he turns 60 this July.

 In anticipation of his appointment, the RSS?s mouthpiece, Organiser, has already run an article by V. Sundaram, a retired IAS officer, to criticise the decision and run down Chawla.

 Sources in the department of personnel and training said the proposal was thrust on the department?s establishment division last year, which sought legal opinion on it.

 A clarification from the law ministry that sought to inquire the justification for giving fixed tenures to the two secretaries had convinced the department to lie low. The proposal was revived again a few months ago and was sent to the appointments committee of the cabinet.

 It is not clear if the proposal was formally approved by the committee. Officials, however, said before a notification could be issued an informal assessment by the government observed that retired and serving bureaucrats would move court if the rules were changed.

 So far, only the CBI director and the cabinet secretary have a two-year tenure, the former in view of a Supreme Court order. Officials said though the government continues to believe in principle that secretaries should be given longer tenures to improve performance, according this privilege to only two secretaries would raise questions of equality.

 Some departments might be considered more important than others but technically, all central government secretaries need to be treated equally. It is being suggested that the government would have to upgrade the posts of these two departments if they are to be given special treatment.

 Officials, however, do not rule out the ?distinct possibility? that the government would dig out the fixed-tenure proposal a few months down the line after working harder on the legal aspects.

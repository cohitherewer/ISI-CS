 SC scanner on fodder judges

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: The Supreme Court today questioned the way judges have been picked to hear fodder scam cases against Laloo Prasad Yadav, or prevented from doing so.

 The apex courts move is a blow to the railway minister and his former chief minister wife Rabri Devi when they are in the middle of a crucial election to the Bihar Assembly.

 The three-judge bench ordered Patna High Court to explain how Munni Lal Paswan, a judge now hearing fodder cases in a Patna special court, was appointed when his name hadnt been on the list of those to be considered for the job.

 The apex court asked that the annual confidential report (ACR) of Paswan ? and those of the four judicial officers earlier transferred while hearing fodder cases ? be produced before it before the next hearing on December 6.

 The court also asked for the minutes of the committee that had recommended the promotion and transfer of 14 additional sessions judges in Bihar.

 Petitioners Rajiv Ranjan Lallan of the Janata Dal (United) and Sushil Modi of the BJP have argued that Laloo and Rabri, using their clout, had transferred four judges to derail fodder case trials.

 The apex court had earlier sought to know the circumstances and conditions of such transfers. Today, it said the registrar-general of Patna High Court should appear to answer its questions on December 6.

 In particular, the apex court wants it explained how persons named not even in the list of recommendation were chosen to hear the fodder cases.

 Justice S.N. Variava, who heads the bench, is set to retire in the first week of November. But he made it clear that the Supreme Court would continue to monitor the case after his retirement with another judge presiding over the bench. The other two judges on the bench are Justices A.R. Lakshmanan and S.H. Kapadia.

 Laloo and Rabri had also allegedly manipulated their income-tax cases by bringing in a special judge from Delhi who overnight gave them a clean chit. 

 On this, the Supreme Court had sought to know the total number of cases pending before the income-tax tribunal in Patna and the disposal rate of such cases to determine whether undue haste was shown in favour of the power couple.

 Laloo and Rabri had suffered another jolt from the Supreme Court before the polls when a constitution bench ruled that the dissolution of the previous Bihar Assembly ? a move widely seen as favouring the Rashtriya Janata Dal ? had been unconstitutional.

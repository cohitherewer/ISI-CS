 Rights brigade picks holes in nikaahnama

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 No relief

 Mumbai, May 9: Tearing into shreds the model nikaahnama released last week by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, several womens and human rights organisations slammed it for being blatantly anti-women and reactionary.

 At a news conference called by the Muslim Womens Rights Network, Majlis, India Centre for Human Rights and Law and Forum Against Oppression of Women, the speakers pointed out why the nikaahnama (marriage contract), touted as ?revolutionary? by the board, was not acceptable.

 ?We had hoped that the personal law board would protect womens rights with the nikaahnama,? said Noorjehan of the Muslim Womens Rights Network. ?However, this would not only be a retrograde step undermining the rights of Muslim women, but would also further ghettoise the community.?

 Citing examples from the nikaahnama, she said it was an act of misogyny ? something the law board has always been guilty of. The activists also rejected the law board and its authority, saying it did not represent Indian Muslims.

 The nikaahnama contains the following recommendations for women, they said.

 ?Jahan tak mumkin ho shauhar ki raahat ka lihaaz rakhna? (As far as possible, the wife should be considerate about the need of the husband for ?relief?)

 ?Jaaiz baaton mein iski farmabardari karna? (The wife should be obedient to the husband)

 ?Kahin aana jaana ho to shauhar ki ijazat se jaana? (The wife should take the permission of the husband before stepping out)

 ?Apni izzat aur aabru ka poori tarah hifazat karna? (She should be very cautious about her honour and respectability)

 ?Hazbe zaroorat walidaiyan aur moharrim rishtedaaron se mulaqat ka mauqa dena? (When the need arises, the wife should be allowed to meet her parents and relatives)

 ?Another negative feature of the nikaahnama is that the board encourages a couple to turn to Muslim authorities for arbitration on their marriage, as opposed to the secular, judicial system of the country,? Noorjehan said, as Musqaan, another activist, tore a copy of the nikaahnama into bits.

 But it was most under attack for avoiding the triple talaq and not giving women the right to seek divorce.

 Several members of the community, including women who have suffered because of Islamic marital laws in India, said the board does not even mention it clearly while its absolute withdrawal is the need of the hour.

 Hassan Kamal, a columnist and a more moderate voice, criticised the board strongly for being evasive on triple talaq. ?It is un-Quranic and 21 Islamic countries in the world have either banned it or have made court intervention compulsory in marriage arbitration,? he said.

 He added that individual members on the board saw the necessity of real reform, but could not push it through because of sectarian politics within.

 Shameem, a bead-worker from Santa Cruz, broke into sobs as she talked about her 12-year-old marriage to an unemployed man who could not maintain her or their two children but would not let her step out of the house. However, she could not seek divorce as Islamic law did not allow that.

 The organisations are pressing for talaq-e-tafwiz, which is the womans right to divorce, if her husband has granted her the power, but the board is not encouraging on that.

 Hasina Khan of Awaaz-e-Niswan and Noorjehan said the nikaahnama was also pointless because it was not made mandatory by the board, nor was the board the representative voice of Muslims in the country.

 ?There is a common misconception that the board is the law-making body for Muslims in the country and its word is the rule of law. The other misconception is that they are representative of the Muslim voice, a notion reinforced by political parties and the media,? Khan said.

 ?Hum nikaahnama aur board ko nahin mante,? Musqaan said.

 But Kamal said it was contradictory to reject the authority of the board while protesting against it. 

 ?The board should ban triple talaq as law. It has the power to make laws. It recently passed the law that ensures the share of a daughter in agricultural property,? he said.

 Traditionalists, however, continued to defend the model nikaahnama on ground that the step should be seen in the context of social conditions and prevailing socio-economic indicators of Muslims in the country. 

 Urdu writer and Muslim board member Uzma Naheed termed the nikaahnama a ?milestone? in the empowerment of the community. 

 Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Sadiq echoed the author, saying much of the criticism was due to ?gross ignorance?.

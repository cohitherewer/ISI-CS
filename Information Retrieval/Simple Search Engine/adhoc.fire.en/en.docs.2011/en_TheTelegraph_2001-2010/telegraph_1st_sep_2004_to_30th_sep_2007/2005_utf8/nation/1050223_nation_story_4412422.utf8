 After bus, Lahore-Delhi college bond 

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 St Stephen?s College

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: Knowledge knows no boundaries. St Stephen?s College in the capital has produced many students who have gone on to rise to the pinnacle of Pakistani society, including former military leader Zia-ul Haq and former education minister I.H. Qureshi.

 The relations between the premier institution of the capital and Pakistan, which were starting to fade according to St Stephen?s principal Anil Wilson, will get a fresh lease of life with the initiation of the Mohini Borker Student Fellowship Programme.

 ?These ties are going to fade with time because most of the St Stephen?s alumni are senior people and they have no eternal mortgage on immortality. There have been so many visa problems with Pakistan that, after Independence, we have not had any of the younger generation from Pakistan in our college,? said Wilson.

 The college is now instituting a cultural exchange programme with Kinnaird College for Women, Lahore, through the Mohini Borker Fellowship Committee for Indo-Pak Amity and Cultural Exchange.

 A bus service already exists between the two cities. 

 Under the programme, every year a girl student from St Stephen?s will go to the Lahore institution for three weeks while a student from there will study at the Delhi institute.

 Wilson will chair the committee to select the Indian student, while the principal of Kinnaird College, Ira Hasan, will head the Lahore panel.

 The programme has been set up in memory of Mohini Borker, who had links with the two colleges. Borker, who died in 2003, studied at Kinnaird College from 1941 to 1944, while her children are alumni of St Stephen?s. One granddaughter of the former general secretary of the Kinnaird College Alumni Association in India is now a student at the Delhi institution.

 One of the reasons for choosing Kinnaird College is that many distinguished people of India have studied there, including actor of yesteryears Kamini Kaushal, India?s ambassador to Ireland Usha Nath, and the former principal of the capital?s Lady Shri Ram College, Sundermohini Luthra.

 Lady Shri Ram College is also planning a student exchange programme with the Lahore institution. Under this, two students of journalism from each college will visit the other country for a month to write a dissertation.

 Wilson laments the lack of interaction with Pakistan. ?All our ties with Pakistan are pre-Independence. It is a pity that we don?t have an alumni association in that country, given the cultural and social history that we share,? he said.

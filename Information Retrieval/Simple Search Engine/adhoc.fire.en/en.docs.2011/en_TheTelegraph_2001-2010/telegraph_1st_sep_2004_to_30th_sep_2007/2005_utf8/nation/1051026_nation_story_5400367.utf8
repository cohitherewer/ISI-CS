 No thorns in Ulfa talks path

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: Making a conscious effort to be seen as accommodating rather than assertive, the Ulfa-constituted team of mediators today set the tone for the first round of negotiations with Delhi by promising to steer clear of contentious issues like the banned militant groups stand on sovereignty.

 We look forward to the meeting tomorrow. Our job is to ensure that all difficulties are removed and a congenial atmosphere is maintained for the process to go further, lawyer Arup Borbora, spokesman for the Peoples Consultative Group, said. 

 The Prime Minister, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi will participate in the talks, scheduled to begin at Manmohan Singhs Race Course Road residence at 3.30 pm. 

 The nine-member consultative group, which arrived in the capital from Guwahati yesterday, assembled at writer Mamoni Raisom Goswamis residence at Delhi University this morning to outline the agenda for the talks. 

 Emerging from the meeting, the delegation was greeted by a media contingent eager to know what they had planned for the negotiations.

 Borbora expressed confidence that the peace process was headed in the right direction, justifying his optimism by pointing to the involvement of members of civil society in such a task for the first time in the 27 years that Ulfa has been in existence. 

 He said the Ulfa leaders decision to form a team of mediators reflected their wisdom and desire to restore peace.

 The lawyer criticised army chief Gen. J.J. Singh for insisting that Ulfa should lay down arms before entering into a dialogue with Delhi.

 Borboras colleagues in the consultative group were careful not to contradict him on any issue. Each of them stressed the need for a political instead of a military solution to militancy.

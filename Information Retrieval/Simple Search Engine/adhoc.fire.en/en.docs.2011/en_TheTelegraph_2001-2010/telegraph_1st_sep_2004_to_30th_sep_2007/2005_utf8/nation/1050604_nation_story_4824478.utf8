 Mumbai, June 3: Sunil Dutts daughter Priya Dutt Roncon today said she had not taken a decision about contesting the elections as she is still recovering from the trauma of her fathers death.

 Priya was talking to reporters after a condolence meeting organised by the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee at its office near Azad Maidan in south Mumbai, where she turned up with brother-in-law and actor Kumar Gaurav. 

 State Congress leaders, including chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, former chief minister A.R. Antulay, the committees chief, Gurudas Kamat, and Union minister Suresh Pachauri were among those who paid homage to the late actor-turned-MP.

 Dressed in a simple churidar-kurta, Priya thanked Congress workers ? they had packed the courtyard outside the committee headquarters ? with folded hands for their support. You have made us feel that our family is very big. The whole country has supported us in our hour of grief, she said in Hindi.

 In the last 20 years, he only worked like a social worker. He sincerely believed that the party workers are the most important link in a party organisation. His work should not stop. We should continue his work, she added.

 Priya, a constant companion of her father during his campaigns, which included several padayatras, is familiar with the pressures of being a politician and is believed to be front-runner for a Congress ticket from the Mumbai North West constituency. 

 The other aspirants for the seat include MLA Kripa Shankar Singh and Sanjay Nirupam, who switched over from the Shiv Sena.

 Sunil Dutt and his supporters were upset when Nirupam, a former Rajya Sabha MP, was given entry to the Congress. He had filed a court case against Nirupam for making false statements to tarnish his public image during campaigning.

 Former chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde is also rumoured to have shown interest in staking claim for the Mumbai North West ticket.

 Priyas filmstar brother Sunjay Dutt had on June 1 hinted that she was likely to contest the polls. 

 Today, he said: The family would decide who is going to contest the elections. For that matter, it is Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the family together who are going to decide who would contest the polls.

 Asked if Nirupams joining the Congress had affected his father in any manner, Sunjay retorted: Nirupam is insignificant. My father was too large a person compared to him.

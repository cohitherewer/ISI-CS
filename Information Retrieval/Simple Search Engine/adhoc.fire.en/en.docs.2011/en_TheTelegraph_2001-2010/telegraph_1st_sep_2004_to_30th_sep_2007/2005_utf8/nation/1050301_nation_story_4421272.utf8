 IAS officer at helm of temple

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 28: The Orissa government has appointed senior IAS officer and chairman-cum-managing director of the Grid Corporation of Orissa, Suresh Mohapatra, as the chief administrator of Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri.

 The move is expected to improve matters at the 12th century temple, especially its financial position and security.

 Besides Mohapatra, another IAS officer would be posted as administrator (development) to generate resources and improve facilities in and around the temple. An OAS officer would be exclusively posted to look after the rituals of the temple.

 An IPS officer, not below the rank of additional superintendent of police, would be posted as administrator (security) of the temple. Besides, two more posts ? deputy administrator (finance) and deputy administrator (development) ? would be created and as many financial advisers posted in the temple.

 Sources said the changes have been made to revamp the administration and the security set-up of the temple, which is the biggest tourist attraction in the holy town of Puri, drawing millions of pilgrims every year. 

 Security has been a major concern ever since intelligence sleuths warned the government against a possible terrorist attack on the temple.

 Last year, Orissa Assembly Speaker Maheswar Mohanty urged all 146 legislators to donate generously from their MLALAD funds to help the temple tide over its financial crisis.

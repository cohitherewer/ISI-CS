 Coal officer in net for 1996 attack on senior

 PRAMOD KUMAR PATNAIK

 Sambalpur, April 3: A joint team of Jharkhand and Orissa police last evening arrested a senior officer of Mananadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) in connection with a case dating back to 1996.

 Mahendra Nath Pathak, an MCL project officer at the Lilari mines in Lakhanpur, was produced in the court of the subdivisional judicial magistrate of Jharsuguda and later sent to Hazaribagh on transit, said the officer-in-charge of Banaharpali police station, Hemant Kumar Panda.

 Sources in the police said Pathak, then an engineer at the coalmines near Patratu in Jharkhand, is accused of sending criminals to the residence of then general manager of the mines to exact revenge over some professional dispute in 1996. 

 The criminals not only looted valuables from the general manager?s house but also killed his son.

 Pathak?s involvement in the attack on the senior official came to light during the trial of the case in a Hazaribagh court. While the magistrate awarded life imprisonment to two of the accused, he issued a warrant of arrest against the enginner in 2002, the police said.

 Pathak managed to get transferred to MCL in Orissa, and Jharkhand police, too, did not pursue the case.

 After years of gathering dust, the case resurfaced during a recent review by the inspector-general of police and a team led by inspector Girish Pandey was despatched to Orissa. Yesterday, the joint police team arrested Pathak from his workplace, about 100 km from here.

 ?We will initiate departmental action against Pathak if the detention exceeds 24 hours,? said a senior MCL official.

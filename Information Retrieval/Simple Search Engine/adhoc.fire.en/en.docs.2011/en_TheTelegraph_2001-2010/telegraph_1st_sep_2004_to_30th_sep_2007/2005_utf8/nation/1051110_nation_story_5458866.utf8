 Beijing role, Kabul entry on table

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: A proposal is being mooted to include China as a dialogue partner in Saarc.

 Indications also suggest that Afghanistan may become the eighth member of the regional group at its summit in Dhaka this weekend.

 At present, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation has seven members ? India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who leaves for Dhaka on Friday, will hold talks with his counterparts from the neighbouring countries, including Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and King Gyanendra of Nepal, on the sidelines of the summit.

 He will also meet his host and Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia.

 While Delhi is keen on Kabuls inclusion, some others want China to become a dialogue partner. The Saarc charter requires the members to take all decisions by consensus.

 The summit would be deliberating upon the decision to admit Afghanistan as a new member of Saarc. India would be happy to support Afghanistans bid, a foreign ministry statement said this evening. The statement, however, did not mention China.

 Countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan, which may object to Afghanistans inclusion, have so far remained non-committal.

 But Indian officials said the Afghan leadership had already approached Pakistan and got a positive response from Islamabad. If other members agree to bring in Kabul, there is every chance that Dhaka, too, will go along. 

 Japan has informally indicated that if Beijing is accorded the status of a dialogue partner, Tokyo should also be accommodated in the group.

 Although both China and Japan are important players not only in Asia but also at the international level, many Saarc members are against expanding the groups activities beyond South Asia so fast. They want better co-ordination among the existing members before bringing in East Asian countries like China and Japan as dialogue partners.

 At the proposed meeting with Aziz, Singh is likely to discuss recent steps taken to open points across the Line of Control to help earthquake-affected people of the two Kashmirs and the progress of the composite dialogue.

 But Singh will also take the opportunity to draw Azizs attention to Islamabads commitment to stop cross-border terrorism.

 During his meeting with Gyanendra, Singh is likely to deliver a tough message to the king that unless he takes urgent and visible steps to bring back democracy in Nepal, India may not hesitate to look at a scenario in the neighbouring country where the monarchy is no longer relevant.

 Their last meeting in Indonesia few months ago had led to the resumption of non-lethal defence equipment supply from India to Nepal.

 The decision had evoked strong protests in Nepal and India.

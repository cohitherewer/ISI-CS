 HC refuses to stay canal work

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, June 30: A desperate attempt by south Tamil Nadus coastal fishing communities to stop the Sethusamudram ship canal project on environmental grounds failed today as Madras High Court declined to stay any activity connected with the projects implementation.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will inaugurate the Rs 2,427-crore project at Madurai on July 2 in the presence of United Progressive Alliance chief Sonia Gandhi. 

 Under the project, a navigable canal will be dredged through the Palk Strait to connect the Gulf of Mannar and the Bay of Bengal to create a short cut for ships sailing from the west coast to the east.

 The fishermens groups, who fear they will be hit most by the project, and represented by the Coastal Action Network (CAN), had in a petition sought quashing of the environmental impact assessment cleared for the project by the Union environment ministry on March 31.

 CAN, headed by social activist Ossie Fernandez in Tuticorin, said dredging in the Gulf of Mannar would turn out to be a futile exercise, as fast water currents would quickly level the dredged portions of the seabed.

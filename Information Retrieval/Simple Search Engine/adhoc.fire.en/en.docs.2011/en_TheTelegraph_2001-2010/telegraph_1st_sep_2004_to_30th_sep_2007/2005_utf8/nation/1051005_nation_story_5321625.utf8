The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Nation at a Glance

 Wretched label on Mumbai

 Singapore (PTI): The Asia-Pacific 

 region boasts not only of some of the world?s most liveable 

 cities but also a number of the most wretched ones on earth, 

 including Mumbai, according to a survey.

 Vancouver in Canada topped the global list of liveable cities compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).

 Melbourne came second and three other Australian cities ? Perth, Adelaide and Sydney ? were in the top 10, with Brisbane at 11th.

 Also among the 10 best cities were Vienna, Geneva, Zurich, Toronto and Calgary ? making Canada and Australia the most liveable countries.

 Port Moresby, Papua New Guineas notorious capital, tied with Algiers for the dubious title of the worst city.

 Other Asia-Pacific cities at the very bottom of the list were Dhaka, Karachi, Phnom Penh and Mumbai. 

 Call to change monkey plan

 Jaipur (PTI): An Indo-US joint research 

 group has asked the government not to treat monkeys as stray 

 dogs or cattle as projected in the proposed action plan 

 for controlling the menace.

 In a letter to the Prime Minister, the Jodhpur-based Primate Research Centre also recommended setting up of a special committee for survival, translocation and sterilisation of monkeys.

 Institute chairman S.M. Mohnot said the sterilisation drive by civic bodies, including that of Delhis, should be stopped as it would affect the creatures breeding prospects. 

 Instead of male monkeys, the sterilisation of female monkeys living in urban density be preferred and their translocation to forests be ensured to save the declining species of primates in protected forests, he said.

 Bar girl plea

 Mumbai (PTI): A special 

 court has rejected the bail plea of bar girl Tarannum Khan 

 and that of two alleged bookies.

 The court said their release on 

 bail would hamper the probe. The three were arrested for 

 their alleged involvement in a cricket-betting racket.

 Lanka flight

 Chennai (PTI): A Muscat-bound 

 Sri Lankan Airlines aircraft from Colombo with 103 passengers 

 on board made an emergency landing at the airport here on 

 Monday evening because of a technical fault. The flight 

 left for Muscat on Tuesday morning. 

 Man robs aunt

 Mumbai (PTI): A woman was 

 robbed of American dollars worth Rs 2.2 lakh by her nephew 

 at Naralwadi Kabrastan here on Monday. Sayyad Nasir Ajgar 

 Ali Meeraj had allegedly robbed Parveen Hasanali Sheriff, 

 who recently returned from abroad, when she refused to give 

 him money. 

 Manipal Institute of Technology students have created an 8.65-km straw structure that they claimed to have eclipsed the earlier Guinness record. They used 40,000 pieces of straw for it.

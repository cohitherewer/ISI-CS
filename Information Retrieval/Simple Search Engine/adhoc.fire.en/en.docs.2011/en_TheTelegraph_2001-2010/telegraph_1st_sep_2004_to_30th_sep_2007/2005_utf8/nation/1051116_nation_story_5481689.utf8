 Money cant stop job hunt 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: A stable job that pays pots and pots of money is no longer enough to keep an employee in an organisation for long, an online survey has found.

 According to a poll conducted in September-October by Monster India www.monsterindia.com, more and more people with high salaries are now on the lookout for better options.

 Asked to click one of four options that best described them, 51 per cent of 20,133 respondents went for employed but actively looking for a new job.

 About 27 per cent clicked looking for my first career option, 14 per cent unemployed and 8 per cent looking for advice about development in my current role.

 The survey was part of Monster Meter, an ongoing series of polls to gauge peoples opinions on their careers and the workplace. It was open to users logging in from India only.

 According to the survey, the primary reason people explored newer openings was the sheer variety of options in the job market and a booming economy.

 Hema Ravichandran, former HR head of Infosys, said: The Indian professional is on a learning curve. Further, the boom in the market has opened up opportunities and led to higher aspirations.

 Salary and stable job alone is not a comfort factor. HR heads will have to devise more learning, bring in emotional levers for engagement factor. I cannot comment on the survey, but these are emerging trends today.

 Dhruv Shenoy, vice president, marketing, Monster Asia, said the poll vindicated the view that people were going with more than two-three appointment letters in hand.

 That also throws up another factor: the human resource manager will have to not only work hard but continuously analyse the working conditions to retain the best talents.

 He said it was not as if 51 per cent people would always be seriously looking for a change. But then, if they come across an exciting option that is better than their existing one, there is a chance of their moving on.

 The survey said it was a clear case of supply and demand in the job market. Members of the workforce today commanded more bargaining power than ever before and market dynamics supported them, too.

 Vijay Iyer, CEO Mentor Consultancy, said the finding that professionals would not stay in an organisation just for the sake of stability was true.

 They are constantly looking for more challenges, if they get it, they opt for it. The trend is to keep evolving as a professional and moving to a new job is no longer a negative aspect.

 House order

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 9: Patna High Court today tightened the screws on politicians and bureaucrats who have illegally occupied government quarters in the capital.

 A division bench headed by Chief Justice Nagendra Rai directed state house construction secretary K.K. Pandey to remove all unauthorised occupants and report to the court on March 21.

 It also ordered the government to charge all such occupants rent at the market rate from the time of their stay in the government quarters.

 The court was hearing a petition by the Patna Citizens? Forum, which had challenged the encroachment of public property in the capital.

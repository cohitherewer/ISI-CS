 YSR son out of murder dock

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 

 Hyderabad, Jan. 31: Andhra Pradesh police today absolved Jaganmohan, son of chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, from involvement in the murder of Telugu Desam Party legislator P. Ravindra.

 Four persons have been arrested even as a CBI team is slated to arrive here tomorrow to take over the case. 

 J. Srinivas Reddy, allegedly the prime shooter, was picked up last night from a tenement in the city?s Chikkadapally area by the Anantpur district police.

 The arrests were made on the basis of information given by one of the alleged assassins, Rekhamayya, who had surrendered three days ago at Mahboobnagar.

 Ravindra, the Penugonda legislator, was gunned down by a group of men as he came out of the Desam headquarters in Anantpur town last week. Desam supporters took to the streets in protest, unleashing violence across the state. Around 85 buses were burnt and over 550 damaged.

 The Anantpur district police claim that G. Suryanarayan Reddy, a bitter opponent of Ravindra, is the mastermind. Reddy, whose wife had lost the Penugonda seat to Ravindra and who is in jail in connection with a bomb blast case, had funded the operation from behind bars, they alleged.

 Over Rs 1.20 crore was promised to the assassins and half the sum has been paid, the police added. ?Two associates of Ravindra had also been roped in to provide logistics and information on the MLA?s movements,? superintendent of police R.S. Praveen Kumar said.

 ?We will present the case to the CBI with all the evidence recovered. We have seized the escape vehicle and also one of the pistols used,? he added.

 The police, however, are yet to give a clean chit to state panchayat raj minister J.C. Diwakar Reddy and IPS officer R.P. Meena, who have been named in the FIR filed in the murder case. 

 Meena, the Rayalaseema inspector-general of police, has been relinquished of his charge of investigation.

 Diwakar, who hails from Anantpur district, sprang a surprise when he accused Desam president N. Chandrababu Naidu of being behind the murder. ?Naidu and Ravindra were at loggerheads as Ravindra had ambitions of becoming chief minister,? Diwakar told a news conference. He added that two of his private buses were set ablaze by the Desam protesters. 

 More than 35 Desam activists, including several legislators, were arrested for their involvement in the mob violence following the killing and later released on bail. The police have lodged nearly 400 cases of arson and mob violence.

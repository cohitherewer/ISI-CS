 Snubbed Mufti skips meet

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 (Top) Mufti, Patil

 Srinagar, July 10: Denied a lunch invitation, the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister today refused to meet the Union home minister for a security review.

 The list of delegates invited to stay back for lunch after the meeting at Raj Bhavan was long. But the governor, Lt Gen (retd) S.K. Sinha, whose relations with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed have nosedived recently, omitted the chief ministers name from it.

 It was left to deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma to represent the state government at the meeting, which discussed the overall security situation with special focus on the Amarnath yatra.

 Sources close to the chief minister said Raj Bhavans move was a breach of protocol and Sayeed had stayed away in protest.

 Relations between the governor and the chief minister had worsened over their disagreement over the duration of the annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath shrine.

 The governor, who heads the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board, insisted on a two-month yatra period while the state government argued that extending the pilgrimage beyond one month would overburden the security apparatus. The protection of the thousands of pilgrims who visit the cave shrine set at 13,000 feet requires a massive mobilisation of men and material.

 Patil arrived here this morning on a days visit and visited the Amarnath shrine. He was received there by the chief executive officer of the shrine board, Arun Kumar.

 The home minister offered puja and flew to Baltal to review the security arrangements for the yatra. He was informed by the board officials that extra care was being taken to preserve the environment along the yatra route.

 Patil appreciated the arrangements made for this years pilgrimage and said the annual yatra portrays Kashmirs unique pluralistic ethos with all communities contributing to its success.

 The home minister called on the governor, who told him that over a lakh pilgrims had visited the shrine till last evening while two lakh advance bookings had been made all over the country. This is in addition to the bookings made at Pahalgam, Baltal and Srinagar.

 Last year, too, there was a controversy over the duration of the yatra after the governor had announced that the pilgrimage would last two months instead of the traditional one month. Sayeed had opposed this.

 This led four junior ministers from the Congress, Sayeeds coalition partner, to resign. The chief minister bowed to pressure and extended the pilgrimage period from 30 to 40 days.

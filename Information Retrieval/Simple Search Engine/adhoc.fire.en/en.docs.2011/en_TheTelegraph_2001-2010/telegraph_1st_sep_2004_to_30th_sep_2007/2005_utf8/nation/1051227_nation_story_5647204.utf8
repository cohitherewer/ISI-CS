 Big Two blanked out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 26: The BJP today began its silver jubilee celebrations but its towering two were blanked out.

 Pictures of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani were nowhere to be found on the main banner on the dais as the partys national executive began its first session.

 Instead, pictures of M.S. Golwalkar and K.B. Hedgewar stared out of the foreground with Shyama Prasad Mookerjee and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya looking on from behind.

 The message, more a note of caution struck by the RSS, was very clear: forget individual ambitions and stick to ideology.

 Senior RSS functionary Madan Das Devi kicked off the mahadhiveshan proceedings with a reminder to delegates of the BJPs ideological links with the RSS.

 It is not a party that belongs to a family or some individuals. Strict adherence to ideological principles is the key to future growth, he said.

 To watch the BJP grow with the pious principles that make its solid foundation is the only interest an RSS worker has. We have a firm belief that the BJP has the capacity to resolve past problems and surge ahead. In this, you have the unstinted support of the RSS.

 Party general secretary Pramod Mahajan said the RSS message had been taken. The BJP has been a victim of reality and its own public image. Who can understand it better than me? he said.

 But he would not totally toe the line. He conceded the BJP was not a party of individuals, but at the same time insisted Vajpayee and Advani occupied a special status in the party. Atalji and Advaniji are our tallest leaders, he said.

 Mahajan has also made sure that the tallest two are projected during the celebrations in a grand, almost theatrical, style.

 The main venue of the council has been designed by Nitin Desai, famous for the sets of Devdas and Lagaan. A huge cardboard set that is an exact replica of the Red Fort has been put up.

 On December 29, towards the end of the celebrations, Vajpayee and Advani will emerge out of a huge lotus, designed specially for the grand finale.

 Advani today preferred to sing along with the RSS. The BJP was founded on the question of its relationship with the RSS.

 In 1951, Shyama Prasad Mookerjee approached the RSS and a few swayamsevaks were loaned to the BJP. I was one of them. We have a deep commitment to the ideology and the Sangh, he said.

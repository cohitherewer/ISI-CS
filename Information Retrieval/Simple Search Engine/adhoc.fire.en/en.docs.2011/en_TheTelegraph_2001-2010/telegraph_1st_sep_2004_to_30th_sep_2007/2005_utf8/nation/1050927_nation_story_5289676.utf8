 Navy drill 

 Moscow, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Russian warships, paratroopers and a nuclear submarine will take part in joint naval exercises with India next month, hard on the heels of war games with China, Russias defence minister said today. 

 China and India are both big buyers of Russian military technology, and the manoeuvres offer an ideal opportunity for Moscow to showcase its wares, analysts say. The drills will take place in the Indian Ocean, Russian agencies quoted defence minister Sergei Ivanov as saying.

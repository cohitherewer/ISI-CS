 Voter test in election free-for-all

 Pappu (top) , Taslimuddin: 

 Gunning for election glory 

 Purnea, Feb. 13: The self-oriented, even narcissistic, worlds of Pappu Yadav and Mohammad Taslimuddin, the two big names of the region, hugely surpass their association with any political party and both are fighting a battle this time to test their sway over the electorate.

 The difference is that while Taslimuddin?s tantrums were positively answered by Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav, Pappu?s ?wishes? were ignored, making him speak out against the party. They had been demanding tickets for nominees of their choice.

 The districts of Purnea, Katihar, Araria and Kishanganj together account for 23 seats, of which the RJD could grab only six the last time. The statewide ?confusion? during the continuing festival of democracy has made the matter much more complicated, giving Laloo Prasad enough reason to be anxious.

 Almost all parties have fielded candidates in every constituency of the region, making the situation so blurred that voters have to struggle to learn which big name is backing whom. The BJP?s position is marginally clear but Balasaheb Thackeray?s Shiv Sena has joined the drama, adding to the confusion.

 ?Only one person will win from one seat but unlike earlier elections, it is hard even to gauge who is going strong where. The presence of so many Independents, besides candidates from the Lok Janshakti Party, Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, has complicated matters. What is certain that the margin of victory everywhere will be very thin this time,? said a senior journalist of the city.

 ?If the Muslim-Yadav combination is on test in the state, it has witnessed the maximum chinks in this region. Pappu is a Yadav leader but he has vowed to teach Laloo Prasad a lesson. His wife is canvassing for different candidates in different constituencies. Muslims are seen to rally behind Taslimuddin but more than two candidates from that community are present in every constituency,? he added.

 The most interesting twist has happened in Purnea itself, which claims to live with the legacy of CPM leader Ajit Sarkar, in whose murder Pappu is an accused. Sarkar?s wife Madhavi is contesting on a CPI-ML ticket while his brother Pradeep is the CPM?s nominee. The RJD, which claims to have an ?alliance? with the CPM, has fielded Neeraj Singh from a seat where the BJP is believed to be in a direct contest with the Samajwadi Party.

 ?Where does the voter stand in this free-for-all? How can he make up his mind? These elections have become a mad race, which has far too many contestants. Expect big surprises in all 23 seats because the issue of development, or the total lack of it, has also to be accommodated within the acutely fractured caste and communal matrix,? said Krishna Mandal, a businessman of Purnea.

 In at least two seats ? Rupauli and Dhamdaha ? the efficacy of the crime-politics nexus is on an open test. 

 The ?chief? of the North Liberation Army, Shankar Singh, who faces nearly 100 criminal cases and is presently lodged in Purnea jail, is fighting on an LJP ticket against the RJD?s Bima Bharati, whose husband Awadhesh Mandal is lodged in Madhepura jail. 

 Mandal is alleged to have close links with the dreaded Faizan gang while the liberation army works on the pattern of Ranvir Sena.

 In Dhamdaha, the Janata Dal (United)?s Lacy Singh, widow of the dreaded Butan Singh, is trying to retain the seat, being locked in a fight with Samajwadi Party?s Neelam Singh, wife of another notorious figure, Buchan Yadav. Neelam is understood to have the backing of Pappu.

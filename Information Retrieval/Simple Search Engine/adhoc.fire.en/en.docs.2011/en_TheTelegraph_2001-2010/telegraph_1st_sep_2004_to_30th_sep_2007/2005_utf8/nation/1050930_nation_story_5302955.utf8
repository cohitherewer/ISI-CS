 New Delhi, Sept. 29: Sheikh Hasinas trip to India was meant to make rival Bangladesh National Party nervous. Instead, she is a little unsettled with the courtesies she received on arrival from senior Bangladesh high commission officials.

 As leader of the Awami League, Hasina is accustomed to being treated warmly by India. But being in the opposition in her country, she is not used to courtesies from high commission staffers. Nor has the ruling BNP spared efforts to hound her politically and even attack her physically in Bangladesh.

 Much to Hasinas surprise, the deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh, political councillor and protocol officer were all waiting to receive her at Indira Gandhi International Airport when she landed yesterday afternoon. Some Indian foreign ministry officials were also there.

 On a similar visit a little over a year ago, hardly anyone was there to receive her. This time, she was even asked if she needed an escort for her trip to the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer.

 Tomorrow she is scheduled to hold meetings with key leaders, including the Prime Minister, Sonia Gandhi, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani. Foreign minister Natwar Singh will host a dinner in her honour. 

 She is scheduled to leave for Dhaka on Saturday.

 Sheikh Hasina

Hasinas visit last year did not go down well with the Dhaka leadership. That it came days before a proposed meeting between Manmohan Singh and Bangladesh counterpart Begum Khaleda Zia in Thailand made things worse. 

 The BNP saw the meetings Hasina held in Delhi as a signal that India was trying to woo her party to undermine the ruling coalition in Dhaka.

 A Bangladesh diplomat attributed the absence of people to welcome Hasina last year to the mission not having a deputy high commissioner then. She is after all the leader of Opposition in Bangladesh, an official said.

 Experts see two reasons for the sudden change in attitude to Hasina. One, the Bangladeshi bureaucracy wants to show it is neutral and get out of the line of fire before the general elections next year. Two, by being with Hasina and her delegation, it have will have a better idea of the nature of her meetings with the Indian leadership.

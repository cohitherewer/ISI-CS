 Custody death rocks Assembly

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 3: A man detained by Bhubaneswar police on charges of snatching a gold chain was found dead in a lock-up at Sahid Nagar police station here this morning.

 Dilip Kumar Sahu, 32, was picked up by Sahid Nagar police last evening for his alleged involvement in a robbery case. 

 Bhubaneswar superintendent of police Amitav Thakur said Sahu, who hailed from Kendrapara district, was kept in the lock-up after an FIR was lodged. Today, the policemen found Sahu?s body hanging from the lock-up grill.

 ?There was no interrogation of the deceased,? Thakur said. But sources said the accused had been beaten up severely at the police station.

 The death rocked the Assembly as the members demanded action against the inspector-in-charge of the police station. 

 Following this, the police authorities suspended the inspector-in-charge in question, Rajendra Prasad Behera, a sub-inspector and two constables. The police have conducted the post-mortem of Sahu. This was the second custodial death within a week. On February 26, a 67-year-old undertrial died in the Bhubaneswar special jail.

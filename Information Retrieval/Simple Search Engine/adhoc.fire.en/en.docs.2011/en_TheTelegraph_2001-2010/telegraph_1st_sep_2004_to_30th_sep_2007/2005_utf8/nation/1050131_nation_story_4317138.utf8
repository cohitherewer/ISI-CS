 Eye on grassroots poll

 ALOKE TIKKU

 Srinagar, Jan. 30: Panchayat elections are next on Mufti Mohammad Sayeed?s plate following north Kashmir?s encouraging response to municipal elections. 

 The Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, ecstatic at the turnout that was ?beyond my expectations?, today declared that panchayat polls would be held shortly. 

 Yesterday, 49 per cent of north Kashmir had braved terror threats and chilly winds to turn up early at polling stations to elect representatives to their local towns? municipal committees in the first phase of the polls. 

 In a state where elections have been frequently marred by rather successful boycott calls, the latest round has made a point both to the Hurriyat Conference in Kashmir and the electorate in many parts of the country. 

 Three years ago, just about 42 per cent of Delhi had taken the trouble of voting in its last round of municipal polls on a March morning. Delhi had thus fallen short of its previous 43 per cent turnout. 

 Vinod Kaul, director in Jammu and Kashmir?s department of local bodies, termed the poll performance in Baramulla and Kupwara an excellent response and hoped it would be repeated in other towns and cities in the remaining phases. 

 Polling for individual municipal committees fluctuated between 25 per cent for Sopore town and a record 88 per cent for Handwara.

 ?We did not expect such a good response?it is really beyond our expectations,? Kaul said. ?I think it is better than the polling percentage in many municipalities in cities and metros across the country, including Delhi.?

 The exceptions are Bengal that recorded 79 per cent voting in the 2003 panchayat polls and Delhi?s neighbour, Haryana, which notched up 70 per cent in 2000. 

 Jammu and Kashmir officials, however, conceded that the towns showing a high turnout were largely in the rural belts where voters were traditionally known to come out in larger numbers than in cities. 

 ?We will need to watch out for elections to the Srinagar municipal corporation on February 1 that has for some time been displaying a disdain for elections,? an official said.

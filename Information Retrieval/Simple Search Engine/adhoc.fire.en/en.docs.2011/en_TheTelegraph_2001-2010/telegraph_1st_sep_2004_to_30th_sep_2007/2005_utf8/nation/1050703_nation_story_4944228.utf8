 School quota

 New Delhi, July 2: a high-level committee has advised radical changes in education infrastructure in a report submitted to human resource development minister Arjun Singh today. 

 The Central Advisory Board of Education committee, headed by minister of science and technology Kapil Sibal, recommended keeping aside 25 per cent seats in private schools for poor children in primary education. 

 The committee also asked for minimum basic infrastructure and a 1:40 teacher-student ratio. It said 6 per cent of the GDP should be spent on education, half of which should be for elementary education.

 This is the last report to be submitted by the seven panels constituted under the board.

 Laloo SOS to Sonia

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: Laloo Prasad Yadav has pressed the panic button.

 Under pressure from his alliance partners in what has become a free-for-all poll field in Bihar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief rushed his confidant, Union minister Prem Gupta, to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi last night.

 Gupta?s brief, it is understood, was to impress upon Sonia that ?our fight against each other is harming both of us?.

 Laloo Prasad?s move came two days before Sonia?s scheduled visit to Bihar on a campaign for Congress candidates that would take her to Katihar and Madhubani which have sizeable Muslim presence. On the first leg, Sonia had addressed a meeting in Muslim-dominated Bhagalpur.

 Whether Laloo Prasad was suggesting to Sonia to go slow on wooing the Muslims and thus help him keep his Muslim-Yadav support base intact was not clear. But Congress sources said Sonia would go ahead with her scheduled meetings. 

 Sources said Laloo Prasad?s ?unity plea? may have come rather late. ?At this stage what can we do?? asked a Congress poll manager, adding that the party was determined to make the best of the 80-odd seats it was contesting to ?at least? register an ?improvement in our vote share?.

 Congress leaders also reckon the RJD chief wants Sonia to rein in Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan. ?Otherwise, why should he knock on Sonia?s doors? We have refrained from basing our campaign on an anti-Laloo plank, though the same cannot be said about Paswan?s approach,? said a leader.

 After Gupta met her, Sonia is learnt to have held talks with Arjun Singh, who is credited with shaping the party?s Bihar and Jharkhand strategies.

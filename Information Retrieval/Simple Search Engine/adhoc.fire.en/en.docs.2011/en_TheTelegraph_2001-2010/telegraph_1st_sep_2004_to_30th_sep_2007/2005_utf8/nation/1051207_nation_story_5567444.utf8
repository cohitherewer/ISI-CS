 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 6: The man who spearheaded the march to Ayodhya today urged his party workers to launch another movement ? not for a temple but to rid politics of crime.

 BJP chief L.K. Advani staged a sit-in, addressed a rally and visited the house of slain party MLA Krishnanand Rai before calling for a sustained movement on the same scale as that in Ayodhya to end criminalisation of politics in Uttar Pradesh.

 The cry for an agitation, exactly 13 years after the Babri mosque had been razed, came in Ghazipurs Mahmudabad, Rais Assembly constituency. Party workers, Advani said, should take a vow to carry on the movement. If they succeed in battling the menace of criminalisation of politics, it will surely have some impact on the entire country as Uttar Pradesh sets political trends for the nation.

 In Ayodhya, an uneasy calm reigned amid muted prayers for peace. Only about 200 Vishwa Hindu Parishad workers offered prayers at Karsevakpuram and pledged to ensure construction of a Ram temple.

 Most BJP workers had left for Varanasi, the venue of the morning sit-in in front of the Circuit House to protest against last months murder of Rai and six associates.

 Advani said the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in the state was protecting gang lords. Uttar Pradesh should take lessons from Bihar. Till recently, a Bihar leader used to give a free run to criminals. People have taught him a lesson by throwing his party out of power, he said, alluding to the defeat of Lalu Prasads party in the recent elections. Who knows whether it is not the turn of Uttar Pradesh next.

 While Advani railed against the nexus between crime and politics, a police source pointed out that Rai was a don who had taken to politics.

 Advani reached Varanasi with young party leader Varun Gandhi. He later left for Mahmudabad for the afternoon rally. Along with senior leaders like Kalyan Singh, Lalji Tandon, Rajnath Singh, they visited Rais house.

 I am sure the agitation would revitalise the state party organisation but the party workers must take the agitation to its logical end, he said.

 Advani said if the ruling party wanted to help the family of the slain leader, the chief minister must announce a CBI probe into the murder.

 What is the problem in announcing this? What is there to hide? It is the duty of every good chief minister to live up to the expectations of the victims family, he said, making it clear that till such an announcement is made, the BJPs agitation would continue.

 Varun, who drew large numbers of young party workers, urged the people of the state to play the role of Lord Shiva whose tandava dance had driven evil out of the world.

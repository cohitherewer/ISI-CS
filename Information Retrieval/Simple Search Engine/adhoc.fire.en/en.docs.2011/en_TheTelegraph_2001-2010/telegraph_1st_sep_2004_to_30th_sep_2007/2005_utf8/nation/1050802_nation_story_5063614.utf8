 New Delhi, Aug. 1: The Supreme Court today revived the debate on tainted ministers, asking a petitioner to delete vague allegations and file a fresh PIL on how persons with criminal records found a berth in the council of ministers.

 Brushing aside the Centres objections not to take up the issue, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti asked it to explain what is clean governance and who should decide it.

 The court also asked the Centre to reply whether it (the court) could entertain a petition challenging the presence of tainted members in the Union council of ministers in the spirit of the Constitution.

 Strongly objecting to Manoj Narulas PIL, attorney- general Milon Banerjee and solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati contended it was the sole prerogative of the Prime Minister to choose the council of ministers and the prerogative cannot be amenable to judicial scrutiny.

 Probing the matter further will not be beneficial to conventions and parliamentary democracy, Banerjee said.

 Vahanvati contended that qualification and disqualification of a person to become a minister are the same as those applicable for a person to become the member of a House. So once a person becomes the member of the House, he or she can be chosen by the Prime Minister to be included in the council of ministers.

 The line taken by the counsels seemed to suggest the UPA had asked them to take exception to the court trying the matter. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee had recently convened an all India Speakers conference on the judiciary interfering in matters that were of concern to the government.

 My duty is to prevent even the germs of discordance between the judiciary and Parliament, both of which are supreme in their own spheres, Banerjee said.

 To this, the court replied: What is to be debated in Parliament is completely on Parliaments discretion and the court could do nothing about it if it chose not to discuss the issue of tainted ministers.

 On two earlier occasions, the apex court had disposed of similar petitions saying Parliament would debate the matter.

 Fuel toll on fliers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, April 9: Politics has come to the 

rescue of those who stay close to the ground but not those who fly high.

 The state-run Indian Airlines has announced a 12 per cent fare hike across the board from mid-April ? a direct fallout of the rise in aviation fuel prices.

 The privately-owned Jet Airways said it, too, would follow suit ?as fuel prices have become too uncomfortable to bear?. However, Sahara Airlines said it was ?still studying the situation?.

 The Indian Airlines announcement came a day after the Centre decided to leave untouched the prices of other fuels like petrol and diesel despite an international spurt.

 Fear of an adverse political fallout is being seen as the reason for the government?s decision to buy time and hope that the international price situation will ease.

 An Indian Airlines official said as the aviation turbine fuel price had risen from Rs 27,250 to Rs 32,250 a kilolitre from April 1, ?the airline would consequently be increasing its domestic rupee fares by 12 per cent from April 15?. Aviation fuel accounts for about half of an airline?s running expenses.

 He said the tariff increase would apply not only to normal tickets but also to discounted tickets like Apex, promotional fares, positioning flight fares and point-to-point fares. However, the prices of holiday packages sold by Indian Airlines and corporate schemes like Super Saver would remain unchanged.

 ?Confirmed tickets issued prior to April 15 will be accepted for travel at the pre-revised fares for the ticketed itinerary within the entire validity of the ticket,? he said.

 All the three carriers ? Jet, Sahara and IA ? had announced a 10 per cent fare hike in early November after fuel prices had hit a high of Rs 31,000 a kilolitre.

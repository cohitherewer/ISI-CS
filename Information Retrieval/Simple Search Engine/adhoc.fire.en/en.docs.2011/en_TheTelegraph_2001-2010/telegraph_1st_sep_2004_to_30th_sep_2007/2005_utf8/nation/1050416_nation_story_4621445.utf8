 Cops turn to dacoits to catch dacoit

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, April 15: The Madhya Pradesh government has sought the help of reformed dacoits to take on the Veerappan of Chambal, Rambabu Gadaria.

 At a gathering of surrendered dacoits in Shivpuri district, 320 km from here, government representatives, NGOs and Gandhians promised them several privileges in exchange of taking on the Gadaria and Nirbhay Gujjar gangs.

 The reformed dacoits of the seventies, including Roop Singh, Malkhan Singh and Lukka, said they needed arms and ammunition to take up the job. Roop Singh said grievances against the government, political patronage, social injustice and discrimination were providing the ?ideal breeding ground? for dacoits in the Chambal.

 Gadaria is feared in Madhya Pradesh, parts of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh since October?s Bhanwarpura massacre of 13 Gujjars. There is a reward of Rs 50 lakh on his head.

 On Wednesday, Gadaria issued a threat that every night he would rob the Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express passing through Chambal. When the Rajdhani from Bangalore reached Jhansi that night, the elite anti-dacoity wing of the state police took position in virtually every compartment. But the train crossed Gwalior safely.

 The railway and the state police are continuing to keep vigil at night between the Jhansi-Gwalior and the Dabra-Shivpuri stretches, which are vulnerable.

 The Gadaria gang has been code-named T-1 (Target number one). Police sources said the railway had forwarded a letter in which Gadaria had expressed his intentions. According to Ashok Bhadoria, station house officer, Dabra, that falls under Gwalior district, about 80 security personnel began patrolling the rail tracks after railway police were tipped off about Gadaria?s plans. 

 The state has turned to surrendered dacoits for help after eight months of futile efforts to nab Gadaria. Chief minister Babulal Gaur had promised to ?finish off? Gadaria within three months of taking over.

 Two more suspects in Preeti case

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 15: Aspiring actor Preeti Jain might have paid hired killers over Rs 2.5 lakh to eliminate director Madhur Bhandarkar, police investigations have revealed.

 Mumbai police have also launched a search for two more persons in the case. One is an associate of don-turned-MLA Arun Gawli who had allegedly mediated the contract ? supari in underworld lingo ? between Jain and co-accused Naresh Pardeshi. 

 Police sources said Anil Tawade, an office-bearer of Gawlis political outfit Akhil Bharatiya Sena, had gone missing after investigations began into the alleged plot to kill Bhandarkar. Tawade had taken Jain to meet Pardeshi, also an ABS activist, and his arrest could throw light on the conspiracy, police officials said. 

 A search is on for a youth from Bihar, identified as Sameer, who is suspected to have been hired to execute the killing. Jain and Pardeshi were arrested last week on charges of hatching a conspiracy to kill Bhandarkar.

 Capital of rape in dark

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: Delhis ignominious record as a city unsafe for women has plumbed new depths as it emerged today that car-borne rapists who abducted a girl virtually criss-crossed the capital for two-and-a-half hours in the dead of the night without being spotted by its famed patrolling system.

 The Delhi University student from the Northeast was abducted by four men in a Santro from Dhaula Kuan in south Delhi and gangraped in the wee hours of Sunday morning. 

 The men had stalked the victim and her friend after spotting them walking towards a paratha stall located near a flyover at 2 am. The victim, who is from Shillong, and her flatmate were pursing their undergraduation by correspondence while working at a call centre. 

 They were staying in a rented flat at Satya Niketan, a colony that neighbours five South Campus colleges of Delhi University and is popular with students looking for flats on rent.

 Delhi police said the assailants tried to abduct the girls once but failed. Then they took a U-turn, came back and tried to pull the girls into the car. 

 In the tussle, one of the girls was able to free herself and get away. 

 The other girl, who is frailer, was not able to fight off the men. Her friend then called the police.

 None of the patrol jeeps could locate the car. The assailants switched the car midway and drove all over the city, covering the southwest, a part of central Delhi and the trans-Yamuna area.

 The men were between 30 and 50 and shabbily dressed and were conversing in Hindi. 

 Delhi police claimed today that they had identified the suspects based on the description given by the girl. 

 ?We have more or less identified the culprits. We have sent teams both inside and out of Delhi to arrest them,? southwest deputy commissioner Dipender Pathak said.

 The police did not say whether the girl, who was held captive for two-and-a-half hours, was raped in the car or was taken to another place.

 The girl was kidnapped by the men in a Santro, but she was dropped off a Maruti Zen near the Nanakpura Gurdwara, located on Ring Road.

 The girl crossed the road and entered the gurdwara where some priests spotted her. Jagdish Singh, one of the priests, said they informed the police as soon as she entered the shrine.

 Besides the description of the men, the girls were able to give the partial registration number of the Santro - HR 26.

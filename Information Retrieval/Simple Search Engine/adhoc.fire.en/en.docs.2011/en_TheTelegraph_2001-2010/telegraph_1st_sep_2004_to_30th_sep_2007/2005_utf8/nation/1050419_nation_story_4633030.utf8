New Delhi, April 18: If the government took the BJP on board while embarking on its latest Pakistan peace initiative, the main Opposition party has ensured neither it nor the Sangh parivar struck discordant notes while Pervez Musharraf was in India.

 Barring one critical statement from Sharad Yadav of the Janata Dal (United) that the Centre should have spiked Musharraf?s meeting with the Hurriyat, the NDA kept mum.

 BJP sources said the NDA parliamentary party, which is meeting tonight to formulate its floor strategy for the second half of the budget session, may not issue a response to the Indo-Pak joint statement. ?When the big two in our party have spoken whatever needs to, is there anything more to be said?? they asked.

 The BJP, however, stressed two points: one, this round of talks and the joint statement that emanated were a fallout of the initiative taken by Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he was Prime Minister. Two, the party was in favour of ?continuity? in Indo-Pak relations and foreign policy.

 Sources said Vajpayee and BJP chief L.K. Advani emphasised the second point in their meetings with Musharraf and assured him there was a ?consensus? in the political establishment on Indo-Pak matters. 

 The Pakistan President wound up his visit by calling on Vajpayee at home this afternoon. After a 30-minute meeting, Vajpayee told reporters the ?fresh chapter? in Indo-Pak ties that began with his January 2004 visit to Islamabad should be carried forward.

 Musharraf reportedly told him he respected him a lot and was optimistic he would give his ?full support? on every issue taken up by the countries.

 There were lighter moments too, as when Vajpayee enquired about Indian fishermen and their boats stranded in Pakistan. Musharraf quipped: ?What will I do with the boats??

 Advani, believed to be among those who ?scuttled? the Agra summit, today said the Vajpayee regime had taken the first step towards normalisation of relations and Manmohan Singh had ?furthered the peace process?.

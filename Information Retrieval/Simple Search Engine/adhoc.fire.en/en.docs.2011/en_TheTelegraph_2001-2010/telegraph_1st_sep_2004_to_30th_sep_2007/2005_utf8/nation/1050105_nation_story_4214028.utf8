 Polls trigger Naxalite shift

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Jan. 4: Camps of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) are being shifted to Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bengal to evade a pre-poll crackdown on Naxalites in Bihar and Jharkhand, a central intelligence report has said.

 The rebels are concentrating more on Uttar Pradesh, where they killed 17 policemen and paramilitary jawans on November 20, the report adds.

 The January 2 report urges the three states to step up their information network and launch a crackdown.

 ?It is worthwhile to keep watch now on unsuspecting places of eastern Uttar Pradesh, the forests of Dandakaranya in Chhattisgarh and its corridor with Andhra Pradesh, and the tribal heartland of Purulia district in Bengal so that these fugitives could be apprehended,? the message says.

 The Bengal government has been advised to keep a close watch on Bankura and Midnapore districts.

 The report has outlined the routes the rebels are likely to take to reach the states. For example, Garwa in Jharkhand links directly with Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh while its Chandauli district, where the November blast occurred, is only a few kilometres from Bihar?s Aurangabad and Buxar districts.

 ?The surveillance on the difficult terrains of Jharkhand?s Daltonganj and Sonbhadra in UP need to be stepped up,? the report cautions.

 Uttar Pradesh?s assessment of Naxalite infiltration shows Sonbhadra, Chandauli and Mirzapur districts as completely affected and Ghazipur, Ballia and Deoria districts as partially infested.

 ?All I can say about the possible pre-poll infiltration of Naxalites is that we are on the job. Intelligence network has been stepped up and security arrangement in the districts intensified,? said Aloke Sinha, principle secretary, home, Uttar Pradesh. 

 The rebels have killed three villagers and forest officials each and 17 security personnel in Uttar Pradesh in November. The police have arrested 16 rebels and killed two.

Force for states

 The Centre has announced that Naxalite-infested areas would be given paramilitary forces free of charge for three years. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security. So far, the Centre used to charge Rs 13 crore annually for such deployment.

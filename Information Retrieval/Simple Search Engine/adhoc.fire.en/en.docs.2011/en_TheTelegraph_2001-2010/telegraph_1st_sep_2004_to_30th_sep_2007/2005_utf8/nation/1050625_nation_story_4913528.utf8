 BJP tells off Yashwant

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 24: The BJP has warned Yashwant Sinha against taking party problems to the press before discussing them at internal fora and said it would back Arjun Munda in the battle between the two leaders.

 In the second controversy he stoked this month, Sinha accused the Munda regime of corruption and profligacy in a TV interview and claimed the Jharkhand chief minister had not bothered to acknowledge his letters though he was a Rajya Sabha MP from the state.

 Earlier, he had attacked L.K. Advani for his remarks on Jinnah. After Advani quit as BJP chief, Sinha suggested he should step down as the leader of Opposition as well.

 BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley today told the media that he and colleague Rajnath Singh, who is in charge of Jharkhand, had spoken to Sinha.

 He informed us the intention behind the statement was to highlight some subjects to improve the performance of the state government, Jaitley said, adding that Sinha would be spoken to again. Meanwhile, he was advised that if he had to raise any of these subjects, he should do it in party fora and not the media.

 As the BJP headquarters buzzed with speculation that Sinha was on the verge of quitting the party in search of greener pastures, the former minister reportedly said he was deeply pained at the suggestion which does not arise.

 The partys formal response was conveyed to Sinha before it was told to the press. Sources said Sinha conceded there was virtue and sense in what the BJP said.

 Jaitley defended Munda against Sinhas charge that not one of his six letters were replied to. If there was no reply, the proper mechanism would have been to discuss the problem with the central party.

 Jaitley said it was unfair to savage a two-month-old government. It is literally only a few weeks ago that this government was mandated to rule. Those criticising the government should realise it has ruled for only two months.

 The Congress stoked the flames with spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan terming the allegations a serious matter. Sinha is a senior member of the BJP and his allegations relate to very important public issues. As such, we would not have reacted because it is an internal matter of the party.

 But since the issues he has raised concern the people directly, the CM should come out with an exhaustive reply to the charges, she said.

 Natarajan also demanded a considered response from BJP central leaders.

 BJP sources said his statements were out of sync with his circumspect ways and hinted he could be looking at other options, including the Congress and the Samajwadi Party. The only stumbling block was he had five years left in the Rajya Sabha and would lose his berth if he quit the BJP.

 Another theory was that along with Babulal Marandi, another disgruntled BJP MP from Jharkhand, Sinha could be instigating the desertion of five or six NDA legislators to bring the Munda government down.

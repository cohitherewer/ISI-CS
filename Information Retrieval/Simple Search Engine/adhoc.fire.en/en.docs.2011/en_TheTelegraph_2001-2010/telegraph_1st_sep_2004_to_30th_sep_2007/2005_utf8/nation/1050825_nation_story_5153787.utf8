The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Zee fight

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: Delhi High Court today asked the Centre and private sports broadcaster ESPN-STAR Sports to file their replies to a Zee Telefilms petition seeking quashing of the invitation to tender issued by the Board of Control for Cricket in India for telecast and broadcast rights.

 Zee counsel Pratibha M. Singh pleaded the court to restrain BCCI from scrutinising the bids till final disposal of the matter, but the division bench refused to pass an interim order and adjourned the hearing to August 31.

 Senior counsel Soli Sorabjee said the petitioners case was based on apprehension that the BCCI would reject its bid. This was not the stage to agitate the issue as bidding was yet to take place, Sorabjee said.

 Threat twist to Madhumita case

 Lucknow (PTI): The sister of slain poet 

 Madhumita Shukla has charged former Uttar Pradesh minister 

 Amarmani Tripathi, the main accused in the murder case, 

 with making attempts to eliminate her and her 

 family and threatening them not to depose. 

 In a letter to the chief justice of Allahabad High Court on Wednesday, Nidhi alleged that Tripathi had sent goons to her house in Lakhimpur Kheri in June 2003, but no FIR was lodged despite giving a written application.

 Nidhi said she and her family have been living in hiding since February this year. 

 Tripathi, his wife and four others are facing trial over the murder of the poet at her Lucknow home on May 9, 2003. Three of the accused are in jail. The Tripathis and a police officer, also an accused, are out on bail. 

 Nidhi pleaded that the three ? P.C. Pandey, Rohit Chaturvedi and Santosh Rai ? should not be released and sought a directive to police to register her FIR. 

 The CBI picked up Tripathi after a DNA test revealed that Madhumita, who allegedly had an intimate relationship with the former minister, was seven months pregnant with his child.

 No respite for blasts accused

 Mumbai (PTI): A special court has refused 

 to discharge two persons for their alleged involvement in 

 the 2003 twin blasts in Mumbai, saying there was sufficient 

 evidence against them. An anti-terror law review committee 

 had recommended they should be discharged.

 The court agreed with the prosecution that there was enough evidence against Mohammed Ansari alias Usman Ladduwala and Mohammed Ansar Shaikh alias Hasan Batterywala.

 The prosecutor said police had found RDX and detonators from their houses and some witnesses had seen them in a joyous mood after the twin blasts at the Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazaar on August 25, 2003. 

 Hello CM

 Jaipur (PTI): Thousands of government 

 employees in Rajasthan will individually call up chief minister 

 Vasundhara Raje on September 14, seeking an increase in 

 dearness allowance. 

 The move, called Hello chief minister, seeks parity with central government employees on payment of DA. The state has been paying 5.5 per cent less DA, the employees claimed. 

 Border arrests

 Jammu (PTI): Eleven Bangladeshis have 

 been arrested in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir while 

 trying cross the border to enter Pakistan. Security forces 

 said nothing incriminating was found with them. 

 Actor held

 New Delhi (PTI): An actor who played minor parts in films such as Devdas and Pinjar was arrested here for prostitution. Shabnam (name changed), a resident of Mumbai, was arrested on Wednesday after a decoy struck a deal with her pimp, police said.

 The December 26 tsunami has increased the risk of malaria in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands by creating new mosquito breeding grounds, according to scientists.

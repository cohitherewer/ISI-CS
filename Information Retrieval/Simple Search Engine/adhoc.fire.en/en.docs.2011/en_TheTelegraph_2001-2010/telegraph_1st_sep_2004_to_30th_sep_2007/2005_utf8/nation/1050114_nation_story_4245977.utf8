 British Asians in identity crisis, post 9/11

 AMIT ROY 

 London, Jan. 13: A growing number of young people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin have been so traumatised by the aftermath of 9/11 that they now prefer to identify themselves as ?British Muslims? rather than as ?British Asian?, a provocative BBC radio documentary claimed on Tuesday night. 

 The programme on BBC Radio 4, Don?t Call Me Asian, was presented by journalist Sarfraz Manzoor, who began by admitting: ?A few years ago I, too, would have described myself as a British Asian. But these days I am just as likely to say that I am a British Muslim.? He explained: ?I remember that the reason I used Asian was because it offered less ammunition to racists than saying or admitting I was Pakistani.? 

 In his quest to prove that others have also rejected the term ?British Asian? and now want to be defined exclusively by their religion, Manzoor interviewed a number of young people. 

 One man of Pakistani origin insisted: ?I think the word Asian is dead. Recent events globally and for me personally have made me re-examine what my identity is and hence I call myself British Muslim. Previously I would call myself Asian or Pakistani.? 

 When Manzoor interviewed young Hindus who apparently no longer want to be called British Asian, an Indian girl commented: ?Initially, if I had to fill out a form I would say British Asian. Events like September 11 have shaken us all up and we don?t wish to be under that banner of Asian any more.? 

 A young Bangladeshi woman at university revealed that she self-consciously tried out a hijab at home and then started wearing it outside. ?I became more conscious of who I was and what I did and how that affected every area of my life,? she said. 

 Aftab Hussain, who works for a theatre company, found himself quizzed by his non-Muslim friends, ?Why does Islam say this or that?? He eventually found himself ?having to go away and learn about my religion. It has made young people more proactive about being Muslim?. 

 Mohammed Mamdani, the founder of Muslim Youth Helpline, told Manzoor: ?Many young Muslims are in a very fearful state where they don?t know how they fit into a society which constantly refers to their religion in terms of terrorism or radicalisation. This is also propagating the marginalisation and alienation of young Muslims?. 

 According to Tariq Madood, professor of sociology at Bristol University, media portrayal of young Muslims hasn?t helped. ?If there are disturbances at Bradford and the BBC is describing them as ?Asian youths?, Hindus and Sikhs will get up and say, ?Well, actually, what is the point of calling them Asian youths when they are Pakistani Muslims?? ? 

 Madood went on: ?People want to be more assertive of the identities that they themselves choose to prioritise and this is partly because they want to promote their own good image and partly to disassociate themselves from what they see as the bad images with which they are being confused.? 

 Manzoor interviewed young people attending the annual conference of the National Hindu Federation in London, where a young woman told him that she was travelling on the underground when ?I was asked by a young white male whether I was Muslim and whether my people were responsible for September 11. And I said, I am not Muslim and my people weren?t responsible for September 11. So going on from there I do want my own identity now?. 

 But a more representative sample of young Asians, taken, say, at a music concert, would probably find only one out of 100 keen to be defined purely in religious terms. 

 At Oldham College in a city rocked by riots over three years ago, a youth of Pakistani origin argued: ?We are Asian and that?s what we are. I call myself British Asian.? 

 Manzoor interviewed the academic Lord Bhikhu Parekh, who disapproved of the tendency for people to define themselves only as Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs. 

 ?The tendency of a community to define itself entirely in religious terms and to collapse its complete complex identity ? political, cultural and others ? into a single, one-dimensional religious identity is a very worrying phenomenon,? he said. 

 ?No individual is simply a Muslim. He is also a Pakistani or an Indian, he is also a male, he is also a professor, and then for him to say, ?All those things don?t matter at all, the only thing that matters about me is that I am a Muslim,? is in itself worrying. That leads to a great impoverishment of an individual?s capacity to understand himself or herself.? 

 ?If somebody were to say to me he defines himself as a Muslim and therefore he sees me as a Hindu, I would feel he was not only impoverishing himself but he was doing a lot of harm by abridging my identity. It then becomes difficult to operate in a relatively secular society,? Parekh added.

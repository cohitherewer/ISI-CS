 Shadow of past falls again

 OUR DIPLOMATIC EDITOR

 New York, Sept. 15: General Pervez Musharraf had come for his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after floating a trial balloon in interviews and in his meeting with President George W. Bush seeking reduction or withdrawal of Indian security forces from Kashmir.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran, who briefed the media eight hours after the fruitless talks between the two leaders, categorically ruled out even consideration of such an action by Delhi in view of continuing terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. He said India had a duty to protect the lives and property of its citizens.

 The Prime Minister plainly told Musharraf during the delegation-level talks he was disappointed that the President had brought up the Kashmir issue in his address to the UN General Assembly yesterday.

 Musharraf had said in his speech that the composite dialogue with India should be result-oriented, leading to a solution of the Kashmir issue acceptable to all sides with stress on implementation of Security Council resolutions.

 India and Pakistan should not remain trapped by hate and history, Musharraf had said. Any solution must be acceptable to Islamabad, Delhi and above all to the people of Kashmir. 

 The speech was a throwback to a period when India and Pakistan attacked each other over the dispute at the UN, a period, the Prime Minister thought, that was now behind both of them.

 Musharraf had no clear explanation as to why he had gone back on an earlier understanding with India to avoid bringing the Kashmir dispute back to the UN, but he mumbled something about domestic concerns.

 If Musharrafs strategy was to counter Indias decision the previous day to go public with the Prime Ministers comments to President George W. Bush about Islamabad controlling the flow of terror into Jammu and Kashmir, it failed miserably.

 The Prime Minister confronted Musharraf head on about Pakistans complicity in terrorism across the border. He made it clear that there can be no real progress in dealing with Pakistan until terrorism stopped altogether.

 Before the meeting, there were expectations that the two sides would at least show off token progress on their disputes over Siachen Glacier and Sir Creek. The two leaders had committed themselves in Delhi in April to achieve speedy progress on these two disputes.

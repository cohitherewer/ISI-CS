 Indian youth shot dead in US park

 Houston (PTI): A 28-year-old Indian-American was shot dead in a park in Houston by suspected robbers. 

 Akhil Chopra, a computer professional and Hindu Students Council volunteer, was found dead on a bench in a park near his office on Thursday. Chopra had a gunshot wound in his left temple and a bullet appeared to have grazed his forehead.

 His wallet was missing and no gun was found at the scene. Police suspect that Chopra, a devout Hindu who was popular in his community, was meditating in the park when he was killed, apparently for money.

 I think after lunch he went there for a moment of quietness, said Ramesh Bhutada, president of Star Pipe Products, the company Chopra had been attached with since 2002.

 Chopra, who arrived here in 2001 for a masters degree, had been very active in the Indian community. He did a Hindi news programme for Sanatan radio every Sunday.

 Staines convict moves SC 

 New Delhi: Dara Singh, who has been sentenced to life term in the Graham Staines murder case, has moved the Supreme Court, challenging the Orissa High Court verdict, reports our legal correspondent. 

 He was convicted for burning alive the Australian missionary and his two minor sons in 1999 in Orissa. 

 The conviction is solely on the basis of mere presumption, which is contrary to the principles of criminal justice and devoid of law, Dara said in his petition.

 The high court had set aside his death penalty, awarded by a trial court, and sentenced him to life term. 

 Flag arrest

 Balasore (PTI): A 70-year-old mans act of drawing the Tricolour on paper has landed him in police remand in an Orissa village. 

 Nilratan Bawali, pestered by his grandsons for a flag, drew the Tricolour on paper, which the kids took out on Independence Day. But neighbours lodged a complaint that the labourer was dishonouring the flag by drawing it wrongly.

 Girl rescued

 Sonepat (PTI): A girl from Haryanas Gohana town who was allegedly kidnapped, kept captive and raped by a youth, has been rescued from Uttaranchal. The youth has also been arrested, police said.

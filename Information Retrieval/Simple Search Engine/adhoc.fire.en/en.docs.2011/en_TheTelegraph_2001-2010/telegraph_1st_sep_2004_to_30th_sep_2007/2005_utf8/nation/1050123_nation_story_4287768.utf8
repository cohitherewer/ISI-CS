 Godhra

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: The Election Commission is not in favour of banning a public debate or discussion on the interim report of the U.C. Banerjee committee on the Godhra train burning. It has, however, warned that ?any attempt to communalise the electorate? will invite action.

 Although chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy had expressed his displeasure over the RJD making an issue of the report before the Assembly polls, this is the first time he has said the poll panel cannot actually contemplate barring parties and candidates from raising the issue. 

 Apart from Laloo Prasad Yadav, who had made it clear that he will use the report against the BJP, the Left also has questioned why the poll panel should object to campaigning with a public document.

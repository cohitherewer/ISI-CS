 Rahul, the new Shivaji

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Chitrakoot (Uttar Pradesh), Jan. 17: In this land of exile, one theme kept coming back ? of return.

 And the man they pinned their hopes on for a new ?Ram rajya? was a young leader they hailed as an ?unputdownable Shivaji?. The words revealed Rahul Gandhi?s importance to the Congress as the first-time MP stepped out of family turf Amethi to fire up the party?s youth brigade.

 In times of crisis, there have always been people like Shivaji for ?this country to fall back on?, said AICC general secretary Satyavrat Chaturvedi as he kicked off the youth leadership training camp at the Ramayan Mela ground here. It was here that Tulsidas had spent years scripting the Ramcharitmanas.

 ?Today, the new unputdownable Shivaji is Rahul Gandhi,? Chaturvedi, who is in charge of the party?s affairs in Uttar Pradesh, added.

 Even the way to the ground is steeped in myth. Portraits of Ram, Lakshman and Sita adorn a small enclosure on the road from Dwarkapuri. A signpost where the road turns towards the Chitrakoot forest says ?Banwas Dwar?, or the way to Ram?s 14-year exile.

 In the hall at the ground, Rahul sat quietly, listening to the 250 delegates. Once he stepped out, young party workers surrounded him. ?This is our first chance to meet you directly, sir, and this session is quite inspiring,? said one. 

 ?I am lucky to have you here,? Rahul replied.

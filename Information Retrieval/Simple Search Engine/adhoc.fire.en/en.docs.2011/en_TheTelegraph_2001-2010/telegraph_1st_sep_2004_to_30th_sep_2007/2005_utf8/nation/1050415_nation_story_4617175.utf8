 Sutlej swell revives lake burst threat

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Shimla, April 14: The rising level of the Sutlej has triggered fears of a breach in the artificial lake formed upstream in Tibet last year.

 ?The water level of this river has started rising gradually,? said H.K. Sharma, the director of the Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd.

 ?The data collected by us shows that the level has risen from 74 cusecs to 90 in Khab (in Kinnaur district, 300 km from Shimla), the confluence of the Sutlej and Pare Chu rivers, during last week,? he said.

 Sources in the Himachal Pradesh secretariat said the Pare Chu, a tributary of the Sutlej, is ?bursting at the seams, which could trigger flash floods? in the state.

 ?It is learnt that the Chinese officials, during Wen Jiabao?s India visit, revealed that the wall supporting the Pare Chu lake had broken and the water was overflowing,? a source said.

 A month ago, chief minister Virbhadra Singh had said ?the danger still looms large? as the frozen lake was expected to melt with the rise in temperature in summer. 

 Last August, a landslide had created the lake, triggering panic and evacuation.

 Manipur distress signal to Delhi

 OUR BUREAU

 July 11: Rebuffed by the Naga student organisation behind the indefinite highway blockade, beleaguered Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh has turned to Delhi for help.

 As the blockade on the two national highways entered the 22nd day, Ibobi said his government was still trying to bring the All Naga Students Association of Manipur to the negotiation table. 

 We are trying to hold talks with the agitating students and I have also requested the Centre to help us reach an amicable solution, he told the media at the Assembly.

 The Naga student leadership had agreed to hold talks with Ibobi, but hardened its stand after security personnel escorted stranded goods-laden trucks to Imphal and a protester was injured in firing by India Reserve Battalion personnel at Senapati on Friday. Naga activists set over 20 government offices ablaze after that incident.

 The student association began the blockade after the government declared the anniversary of the 2001 June uprising as state integrity day. 

 The Nagas of Manipur perceive the governments move to officially commemorate the uprising ? it was against Delhis abortive attempt to extend its ceasefire with the NSCN (I-M) beyond Nagaland ? as a challenge to their goal of integrating all Naga-inhabited areas of the region.

 The Ibobi government yesterday wrote to the Union home ministry, seeking its help in ending the crisis. Though the situation in the hill districts of Senapati, Ukhrul, Chandel and Tamenglong improved, concern remained over the shortage of commodities and disruption of public transport services. 

 Last night, security personnel escorted over 30 stranded buses to the state capital. Blockade activists had stoned the buses at Tadubi in Senapati district.

 A three-day bandh called by the Sadar Hills District Demand Committee compounded the crisis. The national highway passes through the Sadar Hills and the bandh will end only on Wednesday.

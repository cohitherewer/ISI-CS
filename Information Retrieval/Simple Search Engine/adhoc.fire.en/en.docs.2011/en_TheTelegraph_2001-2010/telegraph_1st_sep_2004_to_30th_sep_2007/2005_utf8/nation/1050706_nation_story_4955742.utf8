 Neighbour keeps up peace hope

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, July 5: Pakistan 

 has reacted cautiously to the militant attack on the Ayodhya 

 complex, declaring it an act of blatant terrorism 

 and saying it will not derail the peace process.

 Foreign office spokesperson Jalil Abbas Jilani emphasised that Pakistan abhors terrorism in any form. We have strongly condemned the incident. Such incidents, especially when religious sites are involved, are condemnable, Jilani said.

 It will not have any impact on Pakistan-India relations as it is a local issue. Pakistan is committed to the peace process.

 Analysts believe that the caution with which Islamabad has reacted shows that it wants to avoid being sucked into a controversy. But many of them fear that New Delhi would implicate Islamabad in the attack.

 I believe it was a wise approach (on the part of Pakistan) to issue a brief and carefully worded reaction, said Hassan Askari Rizvi, a political analyst. Pakistans government needs to remain watchful to counter any Indian accusation holding Kashmiri militants responsible for masterminding the incident.

 Rizvi, however, was confident that such militant attacks will not disrupt the peace process.

 A senior leader of the Opposition group, the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy, too, feared that India may try to implicate Pakistan in the incident.

 Pakistan is already under severe American pressure on the issues of democracy, reforms and the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline project, Syed Zafar Ali Shah said. He added that India will definitely use the Ayodhya attack to mount further pressure on Islamabad.

 Shah, a former minister, claimed that the pattern of the incident proves the involvement of the Indian intelligence apparatus in the attack.

 Liaqat Baloch, a central leader of the six-party Islamic Opposition alliance, Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal, saw the attack as directed against a minority place of worship. He said terrorism against minorities and their places of worship in India has exposed the real face of the country, which claims to be a secular state.

 Baloch predicted a strong reaction in India to the attack. The incident reflects the complete failure of the Indian government in ensuring safety and protection to the minorities, he alleged.

 The chairman of the Pakistan-India Peoples Forum for Peace and Democracy, rights activist Afrasiyab Khattak, said: The Pakistani and Indian governments must remain vigilant of any efforts made by the elements who want to subvert the peace process.

 He believes that only a determined support by the people of Pakistan and India can save the peace process, which remains a source of major disappointment to the hawks in both countries.

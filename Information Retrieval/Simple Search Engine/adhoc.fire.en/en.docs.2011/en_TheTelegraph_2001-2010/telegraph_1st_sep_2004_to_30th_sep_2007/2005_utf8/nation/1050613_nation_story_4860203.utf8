 Pataudi

 Chandigarh, June 12: Haryana 

 police today widened their hunt for Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi 

 and six others accused of killing a black buck after raids 

 in Delhi, Bhopal, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh drew a blank.

 We have begun searching places where we believe Pataudi and the other six accused could be hiding, a Jhajjar police officer said. Since they have not been found at most of the addresses they had provided us, we are making our own inquiries elsewhere.

 Jhajjar police sources said raids may be conducted on the homes of some of Pataudis close friends if he does not surrender by tomorrow.

 The accused, travelling in two cars, had been caught with the carcasses of a black buck and two rabbits in Jhajjar, home to the Bhindawas bird sanctuary, during a routine highway check on June 3. Questioned by police, they had given their addresses.

 The district police had asked the seven to surrender by June 10 and raided Pataudis residences in Delhi and elsewhere after the 5 pm deadline passed. Yesterday, the accused reportedly asked Haryana police to extend the deadline till June 15.

 The police, however, denied that Pataudi had sought extra time to surrender. We have no such information. Nobody has approached us. The more they keep away from the law, the more serious their offence becomes, an officer said.

 The accused are likely to move the special environment court in Faridabad tomorrow for anticipatory bail. We have information that they are building a strong case for seeking anticipatory bail. We will oppose their move in court, the Jhajjar police officer said.

 Wildlife protection organisations, too, have said they would oppose the anticipatory bail plea in the Faridabad court.

 Of the eight accused, Madan Singh of Aurangpur village, Jhajjar, was arrested and remanded in judicial custody till tomorrow. He has reportedly said Pataudi killed the black buck.

 Another accused, Shashi Singh, has been denied anticipatory bail by a Jhajjar court, which asked him to go to the Faridabad court.

 All the accused have been booked under the Wildlife Protection Act and, if found guilty, could be jailed for seven years and fined Rs 25,000 each.

 Yesterday, Jhajjar superintendent of police Hanif Qureshi had said a watch was being maintained on addresses other than those provided by Pataudi and the others. He declined to reveal the addresses, some in Delhi, saying they were secret.

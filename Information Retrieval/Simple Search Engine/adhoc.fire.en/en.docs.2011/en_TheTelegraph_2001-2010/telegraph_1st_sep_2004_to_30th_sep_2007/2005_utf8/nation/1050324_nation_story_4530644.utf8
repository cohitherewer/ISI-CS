 Anaemia alert rings loud for women

 New Delhi, March 23 (PTI): An alarming 51.8 per cent of married Indian women, between 15 and 49 years of age, have anaemia, and nutritional anaemia contributes to 19 per cent of maternal deaths, the Lok Sabha was told today.

 The problem is more acute among pregnant women and 54 per cent of anaemic women live in rural areas, health and family welfare minister Anbumani Ramadoss said during question hour.

 The minister quoted the national family health survey as saying 35 per cent of these women have mild anaemia, 14.8 per cent suffer from moderate anaemia and 1.9 per cent are severely affected. 

 A survey by the national nutrition monitoring bureau of the Indian Council for Medical Research in 2002 had pointed out that 4 per cent of pregnant women suffer from severe anaemia.

 Quoting estimates of the registrar-general of India, Ramadoss said 19 per cent of maternal deaths are caused by nutritional anaemia, a major cause of which is iron deficiency.

 Assam tops the list of states with over 50 per cent women afflicted with anaemia followed by Arunachal Pradesh and Bengal.

 In reply to a question, he said fertility rate has declined from 6 in 1951 to 3.2 in 1999.

 The infant mortality rate has gone down from 146 in 1951 to 64 per thousand population in 2002 and the maternal mortality rate from 437 in 1992 to 407 per lakh live births in 1998, the minister added.

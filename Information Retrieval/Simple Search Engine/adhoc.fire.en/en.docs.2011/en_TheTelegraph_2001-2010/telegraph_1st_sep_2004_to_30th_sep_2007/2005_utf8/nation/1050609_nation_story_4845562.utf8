 CBI probes ITDC whisky deal

 New Delhi (PTI): The CBI has registered 

 a preliminary inquiry into the alleged corruption in the 

 purchase of premium Scotch whisky by the state-owned Indian 

 Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC).

 The move followed a written complaint by the Union tourism secretary alleging rampant under-hand dealings in the purchase of 20,000 cases of Johny Walker Black Label liquor, sources in the bureau said.

 Although no name has been mentioned, the tourism secretary has requested a probe against two officers, including a general manager.

 According to a source, the complaint from the tourism ministry said the liquor cases, after their import, were put on sale at duty-free shops without observing the correct procedure.

 The ITDC, the source said, has submitted records in connection with the probe and added that the CBI would register an FIR if the inquiry reveals any irregularity. 

 Award to add cheer to walk

 Mumbai (PTI): Regular morning walkers 

 would now vie for prizes at a novel function on Sunday at 

 the popular Priyadarshini park in south Mumbai.

 The Morning Walkers Award, instituted by the Priyadarshini Laughter Club International and the PDP Walkers Group, is aimed at encouraging morning walks and infusing cheer into the exercise.

 Another objective of the award is to create a sense of fellowship among local walkers. When one walks alone, one perceives it as an effort. But if you are able to connect with other walkers, it makes it a stress-free effortless exercise, says Kishore Kuvala, the chairman of the club.

 Walkers have been divided into six categories, including oldest walker (both male and female), couples and those walkers with the best style and grace.

 Johnny Joseph, the municipal commissioner of Mumbai and a morning walker himself, would be the chief guest at the function.

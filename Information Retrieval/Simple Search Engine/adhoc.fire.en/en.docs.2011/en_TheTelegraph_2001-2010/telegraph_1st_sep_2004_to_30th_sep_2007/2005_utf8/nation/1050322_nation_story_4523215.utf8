 Information bill hidden screen removed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 21: A parliamentary panel has undone attempts by the bureaucracy to restrict the scope of a fresh law on right to information to the Centre and asked information regulators to be given a free hand on the lines of the Election Commission.

 The parliamentary standing committee cleared the right to information bill moved by the United Progressive Alliance government but has undone restrictive clauses introduced by the bureaucracy to leave the possibility of officials misinterpreting the law to seek exceptions. 

 The bill also has a provision for a maximum jail term of five years for bureaucrats convicted for withholding information.

 The panel has also restrained the government from charging a disproportionately high fee for providing information and recommended that the fee levied should not exceed the actual cost of providing the information. In case of people living below the poverty line, the information would be provided free.

 The bill, introduced by the UPA government at the instance of the National Advisory Council, has proposed a repeal of the Freedom to Information Act that was passed by Parliament two years ago but never enforced.

 The committee, chaired by Rajya Sabha member E.M. Sudarshana Natchiappan, has ensured that delays by bureaucrats in North Block do not prevent implementation of the fresh law and incorporated changes in the bill that will make it mandatory for the government to enforce the law within four months of Parliament passing the bill.

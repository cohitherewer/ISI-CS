The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Kalyan clueless about missing Nehru note

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Singh: Dismissive

 Lucknow, June 5: Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh today denied suggestions that he had a role in the disappearance of five crucial documents relating to the Ayodhya controversy during his tenure in 1992.

 The documents included a note from Jawaharlal Nehru that directed the Uttar Pradesh government to shift the idols of Ram Lalla out of the Babri Masjid premises in 1949. 

 Documents? What documents? I have no knowledge of any telegram from Nehru that had directed the removal of Ram Lalla idols from Faizabad, Singh told The Telegraph from Bulandshahr.

 The allegation that during my tenure as chief minister, those documents were lost is baseless and smacks of a political motive, said the BJP member of Parliament.

 How can you be so sure that these had existed till 1991 and gone missing after that? Is there any proof?

 How can you search for documents that never existed? Singh asked when his attention was drawn to the state government affidavit that the documents could not be found.

 The Babri title suit pending in the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court took a new turn on May 25 when the home department of the Uttar Pradesh government filed an affidavit of more than 100 pages stating that five of the seven documents asked for by the court are not traceable.

 The advocate for the Sunni Central Board of Waqf, Zafar A. Jilani, had contended that the documents had existed till 1991. The board had told the court that Mata Prasad, the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary in 1949, had admitted the existence of the note.

 The Nehru note finds mention in some contemporary books and a write-up in a mainstream paper. 

 It is believed that the message spurred the state to take action against the installation of the idols by attaching the shrine under Section 145 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 

 K.K. Nayar, who was the Faizabad deputy commissioner in 1949, is said to have got the stick as he was unwilling to do so. The state governments affidavit mentions the designation district magistrate, which is the term used these days.

 The Uttar Pradesh home department has asked the Sunni board to help in tracing Nehrus note. 

 We would rather ask the Sunni board to provide us some more concrete clues so that we could trace the letter, said an official of the home department.

 However, Mohammad Hashim, a member of the board, criticised the request. This is an excuse to take more time, he said.

 Documents available with the court ? other than the seven petitioned by the Sunni board ? include two letters written in 1949 by the deputy commissioner to the chief secretary indicating that the idols had been installed near the mosque entrance on the night of December 22 that year.

 On December 29, 1949, the additional city magistrate of Faizabad attached the shrine and a receiver was appointed to look after it.

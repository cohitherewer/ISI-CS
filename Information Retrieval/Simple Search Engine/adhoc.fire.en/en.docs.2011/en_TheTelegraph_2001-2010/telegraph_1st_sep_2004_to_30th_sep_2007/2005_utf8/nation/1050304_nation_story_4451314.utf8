 Last chance for settlers 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, March 3: The Orissa government today ordered a fresh magisterial inquiry into the antecedents of 1,548 Bangladeshi migrants of Kendrapara district who have been under the deportation scanner.

 The inquiry will start from April 11, sources in the government said. Earlier, the government had issued the ?Quit India? notice to the settlers under Section 3(C) of the Foreigners? Act.

 On February 9, the government had postponed the deportation of the migrants from Mahakalpada following a directive from the Centre. The deportation list, which included several dead people, hundreds of children and a large number of senior citizens, had come in for strong from various quarters, including the BJP, the ally of the Biju Janata Dal in Orissa.

 The state home department had directed the Kendrapara district administration to prepare a fresh list of settlers, separating those who have come from West Bengal from the enumerated 1,548 illegal Bangladeshi migrants staying in Mahakalpada block.

 Official sources said a fresh notice asking these immigrants to prove their citizenship would be served from Saturday. The notice would also ask them to remain at home on the days the inquiry would be conducted. 

 The verification process, to be conducted under the stewardship of executive magistrates, will continue till May 15, if required. 

 Local revenue inspectors, a block extension officer and a police official not below the rank of assistant sub-inspector will also be part of the magisterial inquiry.

 The migrants in question would be asked to fill up the questionnaire issued by the Union home ministry. Sources in the state home department said this would be the final opportunity for them to prove that they are not illegal Bangladeshi migrants.

 The authorities concerned will examine the documents between April 16 and 20 and forward the findings to the home department, which would then send the report to its counterpart in the Union government.

 While almost half the number of settlers have claimed that they have come from West Bengal, most do not have the documents to prove their contention.

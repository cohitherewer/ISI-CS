 Taj tug-of-war gathers steam

 R. VENKATARAMAN AND TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 New Delhi/Lucknow, July 19: The battle over the countrys most famous grave reached the Supreme Court today with the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Wakf Board filing a caveat to make sure it gets a chance to defend its claim to Taj Mahal.

 The move is a logical step after the boards declaration last week that the Taj is Wakf property because caveat literally means dont decide without hearing me.

 Asked to decide the ownership of the Taj by Allahabad High Court, the board had on July 13 ruled that the monument was Sunni Wakf property on the ground that it is the grave of a woman whose emperor husband was a Sunni.

 In his verdict, Wakf board chairman Hafiz Usman, a member of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, had said all the connected mosques and tombs, which were surrounded by a wall were also Wakf properties.

 Insiders said the caveat was necessary as the Archaeological Survey of India had said the boards verdict was not in the interest of the Taj and would challenge it in an appropriate legal forum.

 The Taj will now be like a house owned by two warring brothers, no one keen on its proper maintenance, S.K. Sharma, assistant director of ASI, Agra, had said after the verdict. The order is not against the ASI, it is against Taj Mahal.

 Several heads of minority trusts as well as Muslim intellectuals had also threatened to move the apex court against the Wakf boards order.

 The caveat is aimed at preventing the ASI or anyone from getting an ex parte order without the other party being heard. If any petition, application, is filed, let nothing be done without notices to the board, the caveat filed by Anis Suhrawardy, the counsel for the Wakf board, said.

 The caveat will not be listed for hearing unless the ASI comes on appeal before the Supreme Court.

 In Uttar Pradesh, the boards standing counsel, Mohammad Abid Ali, said it would defend its stand at all levels of the higher judiciary. 

 It has already filed a caveat in the Supreme Court. A similar petition would be filed in Allahabad High Court, too, so that whenever an appeal petition against the order is filed in that court, the board will get a copy of the petition and get a chance to defend its stand.

 Suhrawardy said Shah Jahan had written a will in Persian making it clear that the Taj was Wakf property. The emperor, as the creator of the Taj, himself was the muktawali (caretaker) and his will should stand the test of time.

 Suhrawardy, who annexed the will with the petition as also the decisions of the high court directing the Wakf board to decide the matter and the boards subsequent order, said nobody objects to the ASI being the custodian maintaining the monument but the ownership is with the Wakf.

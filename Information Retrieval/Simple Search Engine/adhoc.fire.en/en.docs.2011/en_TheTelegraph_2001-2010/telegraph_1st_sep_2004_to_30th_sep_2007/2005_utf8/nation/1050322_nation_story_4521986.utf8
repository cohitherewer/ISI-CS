 Srinagar, March 21: GeneratioNext has virtually asked GenerationEx to shut up.

 National Conference president Omar Abdullah has publicly distanced himself from his father Farooq Abdullah?s criticism of the proposed bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad.

 ?As per the constitution of the National Conference, it is only the president, general secretary and the party spokesman who are authorised to deliver statements on policy matters,? Omar told a press briefing here. ?Dr Abdullah was voicing his personal opinion in Parliament.? Former chief minister Farooq is the party?s patron.

 Following growing unrest in the party over the remarks by Farooq questioning the Centre in the Upper House of Parliament over the relaxation of passport and visa restrictions for the bus service, Omar today said the senior Abdullah had no authority to speak on policy matters.

 While members of the same family are known to be on two sides of the political divide ? the Scindias have been with the Congress and the BJP ? rarely have members belonging to the same family and party opposed each other?s statements in public.

 In a recent debate in Parliament, Farooq had questioned the bona fides of the Indian government in relaxing passport and visa requirements for the bus service scheduled to start on April 7. The decision had compromised his status as an Indian citizen, he had said.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had, however, assured the House that the visa relaxation had not in any way compromised India?s position on Kashmir.

 As all the credit for reopening the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road after 57 years is being claimed by the ruling Peoples? Democratic Party, the rank and file in the National Conference was of the view that Farooq?s statement would further weaken the party?s image among the people, for whom the reopening of the road is a highly emotive issue. Senior leaders of the National Conference had also expressed their strong resentment against Farooq?s statement.

 Omar said the reopening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road was a long-pending demand of the party and it had always welcomed the idea. ?My grandfather and party founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah was the greatest advocate of the reopening of the road,? he said. ?There are no differences between me and my father,? he, however, added.

 The public statement by Omar, counted among the brightest stars of the new-age politicians, also suggest that he has his ears closer to the ground than the old guard.

 The National Conference president wanted the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road to be opened not only for passenger traffic but also for trade and commerce. ?There should be a regular, larger daily bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad and all Kashmiris should be allowed to travel across,? he said.

 Omar questioned the effectiveness of running the proposed 17-seater bus on a fortnightly basis. ?We must not waste the goodwill the bus has generated. It would harm us in the long run. The bus should be run on a daily basis.?

 He also said: ?It (Kashmir) is an artificially divided state and we won?t accept re-unification on passports.?

 Omar said he believed that the proposed bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad was the direct outcome of international pressure on India and Pakistan to take major confidence-building measures in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the US.

 He wanted the opening ceremony of the bus to be a national occasion and not restricted to a media event for the ruling alliance in the state. ?I will join the opening ceremony on April 7 only if it is a national event.?

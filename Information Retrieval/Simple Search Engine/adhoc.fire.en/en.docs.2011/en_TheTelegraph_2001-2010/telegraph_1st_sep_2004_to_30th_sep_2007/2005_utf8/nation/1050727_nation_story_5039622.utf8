 Srinagar, July 26: The Valleys corps commander today visited the families of three boys killed in an ambush after they were mistaken for militants and said he was pained by the incident.

 It is an unfortunate incident. We will refine our operations to prevent innocent civilian killings. The three village boys were moving without a lantern around midnight when the incident occurred, Lt. Gen. S.S. Dhillon, the general officer commanding of the armys 15 Corps, said here after visiting the tragedy-stricken homes.

 Wasim Sultan Wani, 12, Bilal Khaliq Shah, 11, and Shabir Ahmad Shah, 16, were killed by jawans of the Rashtriya Rifles when they allegedly walked into an ambush laid for militants at Bangargund village, about 120 km from here, on Saturday.

 I visited the bereaved families and offered a cash compensation of Rs 3 lakh each to the families of the three youths and Rs 2 lakh to the family of the injured student, Dhillon said.

 Manzoor Ahmad Shah, the younger brother of Mohammad Jamal Shah who was to get married the following day, had to be hospitalised with bullet wounds.

 The boys movement at night had been mistaken by the troops of the Rashtriya Rifles as the area was infested with militants who move about during the night, said the commander. A night curfew is in force in the entire area (Kupwara district) for the past several years.

 But the villagers said the army had been alerted and permission sought for night movement during the wedding. 

 I cannot justify the action of my men. It was an error of judgement and accountability will be upheld, Dhillon said. We have ordered a court of inquiry into the incident and action will be taken against those found guilty. 

 The state government had earlier ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident and a police probe is on. 

 Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who chaired a unified headquarters meeting here, highlighted the need to put forth a human face while dealing with militancy. He asked the security agencies to exercise utmost care? to avoid civilian casualties.

 The action, Mufti asserted at the meeting, should be directed against those who indulge in subversive activities. 

 Dhillon said: The army is on standing instructions to be hard on militants and soft on innocent civilians.

 According to a PTI report, the boys families refused to accept the money. Dhillon said forest minister Ghulam Mohiuddin Sofi, who accompanied him, told him they had desired the compensation to be deposited in their bank accounts.

 Hardline leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani today challenged Mufti to prove his pro-people credentials by stepping down from the post and joining the separatist camp.

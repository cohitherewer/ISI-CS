 Cricket rights

 New Delhi, March 1 (PTI): Trans World International (TWI) today bagged the production rights for the India-Pakistan cricket series.

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India, however, failed to take a decision on awarding satellite overseas rights for the series.

 TWI was awarded the rights to produce live feed for the telecast on Doordarshan in an emergency meeting of the working committee of the BCCI here. The Madras High Court?s interim order last week paved the way for the telecast of the matches.

 ?TWI?s offer is $1.5 million, which we are negotiating,? BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra said.

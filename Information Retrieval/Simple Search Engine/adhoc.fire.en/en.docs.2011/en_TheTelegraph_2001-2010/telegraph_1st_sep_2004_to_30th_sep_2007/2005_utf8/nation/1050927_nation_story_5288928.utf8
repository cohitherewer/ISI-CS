 Priya claims river rapport

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has claimed to have allayed Dhakas concerns over common river waters to such an extent that he and his Bangladeshi counterpart, Hafizuddin Ahmad, would even go on joint inspections to settle old disputes.

 The minister, who has just returned from Dhaka where the Joint Rivers Commission met from September 19 to 21, attributed the huge success of the meeting to the personal rapport with Ahmad.

 Das Munshi, however, rubbished suggestions that the bonhomie in Dhaka was because he speaks Bengali. It had nothing to do with the fact that we spoke a common language. How does my speaking Bangla make any difference to the dialogue on river waters? I went there as an Indian government representative.

 The major milestones at the river panel meet include an offer from India to let Bangladesh seek a review of the water sharing arrangements provided in the Ganga water sharing treaty of 1996. Bangladesh has complained that it receives less water than promised in the treaty.

 Ministers from both sides would visit project sites on the Feni and Muhuri rivers.

 Concerns have been raised about repair of embankments, riverbank protection, minor lift irrigation and drinking water supply projects on these two rivers. The drainage problem on the Icchamati river would also be sorted out in a similar manner.

 India has accepted the Bangladesh demand for advancing flood forecasting. The forecast and warning time for the Brahmaputra river from Guwahati has been extended from 42 hours to 66 hours. Warning time of floods from Farakka along the Ganga has been advanced from 41 hours to 67 hours.

 Apprehensions about the Tipaimukh dam project were also addressed. Delhi said the project has no component for irrigation and was meant for power generation and flood moderation only and there would not be any barrage at Fulertal.

 Bangladeshs misgivings about interlinking of rivers have been sorted out, Das Munshi said. People are ill-informed. The media in Bangladesh was writing that we would direct the Brahmaputra to Uttar Pradesh. There was a lot of concern. But I made a detailed presentation and told them that there was nothing to worry, he said.

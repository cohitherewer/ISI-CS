 Taslimuddin 

 New Delhi, March 2: The Bihar government today defended before the Supreme Court the withdrawal of criminal cases against Union minister and RJD leader Mohammad Taslimuddin.

 It said in an affidavit the withdrawal was on the grounds of ?public policy, maintenance of public peace and harmony, social, economic and changed political and social situations, avoidance of destabilisation of a stable government and the likes?. It said the court should only look into ?whether the public prosecutor has applied his mind independently without being subject to outside influence?.

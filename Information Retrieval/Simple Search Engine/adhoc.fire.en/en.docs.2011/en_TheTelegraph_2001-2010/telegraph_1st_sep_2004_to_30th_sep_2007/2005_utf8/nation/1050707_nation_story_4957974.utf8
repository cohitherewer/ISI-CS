 Tarmac and jet taste backlash

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Indore/Bhopal, July 6: Sangh parivar activists invaded a plane and forced passengers out, disrupted trains and ransacked shops at will on a day the outfit called a nationwide bandh protesting the Ayodhya militant attack. 

 Hundreds of angry Bajrang Dal activists barged into the Indore airport and stopped a Jet Airways flight to Delhi from taking off. The plane, scheduled to leave at 8.25 am, was delayed by nearly an hour.

 The protesters breached the high security ring and blocked the runway as the guards watched in silence. The situation was brought under control after the Rapid Action Force was deployed to drive the activists away. 

 Eyewitnesses said the Bajrang Dal protesters forced their way in by scaling a boundary wall and reached the tarmac through the VIP lounge. They squatted before the plane. Some were seen freely roaming about on the tarmac while others climbed inside the jet and asked passengers to get off. 

 However, no major damage was caused, except for some broken flowerpots and advertising boards. 

 Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur sounded dismissive about the airport security breach. A report has been sought. Necessary action will be taken, he said, adding that the security in-charge, who holds the rank of a thana inspector, has been suspended. 

 VHP workers in Indore took out a motorcade rally, chanting slogans against the Congress-led Union government and Pakistan. In retaliation to the terror attack, two dargahs were damaged yesterday in the city after which prohibitory orders were slapped in the Chhatripura police station area.

 According to Indore collector Vivek Agrawal, Section 144 is in force in the city as a precaution. He said the police are yet to identify the miscreants who damaged the dargah of Syed Peer Ali Baba.

 Unidentified persons allegedly threw an earthen lamp at the residence of Indore city qazi Ishrat Ali. Though he sought to downplay the incident, Ishrat Ali admitted that the chief minister had telephoned to check on him. 

 In the temple town of Ujjain, three bandh supporters were injured, one of them critically, when the police resorted to lathicharge a mob that forcibly halted the Indore-Bilaspur Narmada Express. Protesters also stopped the Indore-Bhopal Intercity Express at Indore station.

 At Laxmibainagar railway station, Sangh activists halted two trains.

 Some people climbed on the engine of the Bhopal Express at the citys Habibgunj railway station.

 Mobs ransacked shops in Jhabua and Vidisha districts, both with a history of communal disturbances. In Bhopal, roads wore a deserted look.

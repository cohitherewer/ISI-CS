 RJD faces test of survival

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 22: The biggest challenge before the Rashtriya Janata Dal after todays debacle is to ensure the party, built around a family, does not disintegrate. 

 With chief minister-to-be Nitish Kumar under pressure to take action against RJD loyalists, the partys fate will also depend on how the new government goes about dealing with the earlier regimes perceived omissions and commissions. If a witch-hunt is launched, it will further demoralise the ranks.

 Used to enjoying the fruits of power for 15 years, it remains to be seen how Lalu Prasad keeps his starving associates happy with his reduced strength of distributing favours.

 The RJD, which has lost 21 seats since February, also has to fight the perception that its appeal has become restricted to Yadavs and Muslims.

 We understand that negativism ? attacking everyone, from our opponents to the Election Commission ? had become the hallmark of the RJD in the recent past. We were taken by surprise by the trashing of our anti-communalism stand by the electorate. We perhaps failed to address the real issues and by the time we tried to control the damage, it was already too late, a senior RJD politician said.

 That the BJP, projected as a threat to secularism by Lalu Prasad, won a seat more than the RJD only adds to its troubles. During the election campaign, the BJP had steered clear of Hindutva and the results appear to bear out its contention that development was the issue.

 But the RJD continued with its negativism and Lalu Prasad alleged that poor voters were chased away from polling booths by central forces. Taking the cue, MP Ram Kripal Yadav said the partys Muslim-Yadav base was being victimised by vested interests.

 The party now appears to be taking comfort in the slender margin of defeat of many of its candidates. We went down fighting. That goes to show that we can storm back to power when the time comes, Yadav said. 

 But the blame game might have begun. A leader recalled how Mohd. Shahabuddin, till recently Bihars most wanted absconder, was projected as the RJDs tallest minorities leader against the wishes of a large section of the party.

 The meteoric rise of Lalu Prasads brothers-in-law Sadhu and Subhash Yadav is another sore point.

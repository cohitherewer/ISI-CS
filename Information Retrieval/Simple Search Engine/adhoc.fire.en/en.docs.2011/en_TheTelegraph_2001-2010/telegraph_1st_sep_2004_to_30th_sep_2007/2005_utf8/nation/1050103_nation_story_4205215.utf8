 Tough sell for secular tag

 FARHANA KALAM 

 Gaya, Jan. 2: Lok Janshakti Party national general secretary and former Gaya MP Rajesh Kumar and minority cell leader Sayeed Khan found it tough to sell ?secular Paswan? among minorities of Bihar and adjoining areas of Jharkhand like Hazaribagh, Chatra and Palamau.

 Minority support for Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav has been his success mantra and the LJP leaders know that without weaning minorities away from the RJD, they have little hope in the state.

 A few days ago, both Kumar and Khan invited mediapersons in Gaya as part of their ongoing campaign. 

 Like elsewhere in the Magadh division, the LJP duo found themselves on a sticky wicket in respect to Paswan?s secular credentials and his perceived frog-jumping from coalition to coalition.

 Asked where Paswan was during the worst phase of Gujarat riots, both the LJP leaders looked the other way saying that they do not exactly recall the period of Gujarat riots and the date of Paswan?s resignation from the Vajpayee government. 

 Another uncomfortable question haunting the promoters of Paswan?s secular brand politics, is the LJP leader?s failure to give ticket to a single Muslim candidate in the parliamentary election held a few months ago.

 Though the LJP was allotted eight seats by the RJD-led alliance in the state, the party did not field a single Muslim candidate, while RJD fielded four Muslims, all of whom made it to the Lok Sabha. 

 A somewhat embarrassed Rajesh Kumar said the LJP did not have formidable Muslim candidates and in any case, ?we are going to make up the loss by fielding six Muslims in the Magadh division alone?. The Magadh division has altogether 26 Assembly constituencies. 

 The LJP general secretary also identified the Assembly seats from where the LJP was considering the candidature of Muslims. The constituencies included Gurua, Jehanabad, Nawada and Belaganj. 

 At present, law, energy, minority welfare and public relations minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan represents Gurua. 

 RJD strongman and former minister Surindra Prasad Yadav represent Belaganj. 

 During their mass contact programmes in south Bihar, the LJP leaders also found it difficult to attack RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav on the two issues of promoting dynasty and patronising criminals. 

 The LJP leaders are reminded by people like Arvind Kumar of Sherghati that like Laloo, Ram Bilas, too, believed in promoting only his family members. 

 Paswan?s brothers Ram Chandra and Paras and some of his other close relatives? cases were cited. 

 The LJP leaders said Paswan?s brothers cannot be compared with people like Sadhu Yadav and Subhash Yadav, the controversial brothers-in-law of the RJD chief, as, they (Paswan?s brothers) have been politically groomed unlike Sadhu and Subhash.

 LJP leaders, in private discussions, said the presence of too many criminals and underworld dons in their party and political compulsions as ?gentlemen politicians? prevented them from taking on Laloo.

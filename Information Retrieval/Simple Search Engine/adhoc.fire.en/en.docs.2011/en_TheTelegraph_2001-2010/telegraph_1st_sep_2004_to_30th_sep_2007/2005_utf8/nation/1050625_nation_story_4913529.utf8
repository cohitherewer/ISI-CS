 New Delhi, June 24: After the 75th anniversary of the Dandi March, the Congress spotlight is on the 150th year of the Sepoy Mutiny.

 As Aamir Khan arms on screen to immortalise Mangal Pandeys revolt sometime soon with The Rising, the culture ministry has announced plans to commemorate 150 years of the first war of Independence, which falls in 2007.

 To make the event high-profile, Union culture minister S. Jaipal Reddy and cabinet colleagues Shivraj Patil and Arjun Singh have invited Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to chair the celebrations committee, which will comprise chief ministers and representatives of major political parties.

 We have asked the Prime Minister to chair the committee and a corpus of Rs 100 crore has been set aside, Reddy said.

 There are plans to rope in Pakistan and Bangladesh also for the celebrations, he said. The people there also had a role to play and we are trying to see if these countries can also be involved in some way, he said.

 The minister said there was a proposal to honour Lord Buddha, too, on his 2,550th birth anniversary next year. 

 Another high-profile committee, again with the Prime Minister at the head, would be set up, he said.

 The celebrations were likely to be bigger than an Indian affair as several countries had shown interest in them, Reddy said.

 The minister is also expected to make a trip to the home of Hindi litterateur Munshi Premchand in Lamahi near Varanasi next week. There is a proposal to convert his house, now dilapidated, into a national museum to mark the authors 125th birth anniversary, celebrations for which will begin from July 31.

 Premchands works on the plight of people in a caste-dominated society had virtually vanished from NCERT textbooks during the NDA regime, sparking protests from Left parties, artistes and writers. His anniversary celebrations had also been derailed till the UPA decided they would begin this July.

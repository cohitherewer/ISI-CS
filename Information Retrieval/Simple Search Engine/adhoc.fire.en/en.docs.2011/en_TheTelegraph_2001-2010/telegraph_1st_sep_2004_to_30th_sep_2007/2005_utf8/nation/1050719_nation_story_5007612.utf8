The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Twin thrusts with America

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Washington, July 18: India and the US today launched two major initiatives to expand the scope of their economic and scientific ties: a CEOs forum and an umbrella agreement on science and technology.

 The former is expected to enhance economic partnership between the two countries beyond trade.

 The Science and Technology agreement will help what Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called a knowledge-driven partnership between India and the US.

 The CEOs Forum is the direct result of the reinvigorated US-India economic dialogue and expected to focus attention on trade, finance, investment and the environment. 

 Prime Minister Singh and President George W. Bush met the business leaders from both the countries this afternoon in the inaugural meeting of the forum.

 Bush said: The expertise of these private sector leaders will help our two governments build trade and increase investment for the good of our peoples.

 The umbrella agreement on science and technology will for the first time establish intellectual property rights protocols to enable and enhance collaborative research between Indian and US scientists, government agencies, academia and the private sector.

 With this, for the first time after the 1960s, the US and India will now embark on major collaborative scientific research in the areas of basic sciences, space, energy, nanotechnology, health and information technology.

 In the early 1960s, the two countries had first begun cooperation in agriculture (resulting in the Green Revolution) and later extending it to other areas involving US technical agencies.

 Then for a variety of reasons the scientific collaboration between the two countries fell into disarray.

 Now once again, it is expected that the new science and technology agreement would strengthen the science and technology capabilities of the two countries by forging wide-ranging ties between their scientific and technological communities.

 Bush visit

 Bush has agreed to visit India at the earliest, Singh said.

 Addressing a joint press conference with Bush, Singh said: The US President has accepted my invitation to visit India at the earliest.

 Describing the two countries as vigorous and vibrant democracies, he said the results of the understanding reached during his current visit would be fully evident by then. 

 Singh said India has a compelling case for permanent membership of the UN Security Council.

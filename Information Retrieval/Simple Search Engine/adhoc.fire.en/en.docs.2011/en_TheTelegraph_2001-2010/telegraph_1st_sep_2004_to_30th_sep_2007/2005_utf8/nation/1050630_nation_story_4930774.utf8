 Entrance test back in court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 29: The Tamil Nadu government today drove thousands of students to despair by moving the Supreme Court to try and salvage its order scrapping the common entrance test (CET).

 Madras High Court had quashed the order on June 27, ruling that the test is mandatory for admission to professional courses ? a judgment widely welcomed by the students.

 The government had on June 9 ordered the abolition of the entrance test ? after it had been conducted for this academic year ? and said students would be admitted only on the basis of their plus two examination marks. Over 400 students petitioned the high court against the order.

 The high court had ruled that in a state where students study under various boards, some sort of a common entrance test may be the only way to provide a level-playing field.

 The governments appeal in the apex court, which has prolonged the uncertainty over these students future, is bound to delay this years admissions. After the high court judgment, many universities had set a June 30 deadline for submission of forms.

 The state governments appeal in the Supreme Court focuses on how the test is disadvantageous to rural students and favours city students from well-off families. The state is also believed to have argued that the apex court should not interfere with a policy decision taken by the government.

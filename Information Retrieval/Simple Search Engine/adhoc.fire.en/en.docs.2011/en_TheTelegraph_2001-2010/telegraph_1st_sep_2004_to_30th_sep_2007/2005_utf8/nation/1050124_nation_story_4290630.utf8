 Europe trek ends in Pak

 Quetta, Jan. 23 (AP): Pakistan security forces arrested 29 Indians for allegedly entering the country illegally through Iran, an official said today.

 The Indians told investigators that Iranian border guards detained them about 10 days ago while they were trying to cross into Turkey on their way to Europe, said Barkat Ali, a police official in Pakistan?s Taftan town. 

 Iranian security forces allegedly ?pushed? them over the border into Pakistan yesterday, Ali said. The men were arrested near Taftan, about 700 km southwest of Quetta near the Iranian border, the official added.

 The Indians, aged between 28 and 35, have been moved to Quetta, Akbar Baluch, director of the federal investigation agency, said. They could face fines or several months in jail for entering Pakistan without visas.

 Iran and Turkey lie along a route used by Indians and Pakistanis trying to go to Europe in search of better jobs. Many are caught at borders along the way.

 It was not known whether the Indians arrested yesterday had travelled through Pakistan before they were caught in Iran.

 New Delhi, June 22: Bored of beating about cyberspace and scouting for something more stimulating? How about taking a shot at outer space?

 A never-before chance to go on a sub-orbital (not completing a full orbit of the earth) flight to space awaits you, provided you have more than a smattering of computers and web technology.

 Oracle today announced a space sweepstakes for software developers designed to increase and test their knowledge of Internet technologies and Oracle development tools.

 The testing will be done through online quizzes on specific topics like Java and Service Orientated Architecture development technologies. Each of three lucky winners will be taken on a flight to space and will be able to peek at the earth from 100 km above its surface.

 A winner each will be picked from the Asia-Pacific, North America and Europe regions for the flight. 

 Within the Asia-Pacific region, software developers from India, Korea, Australia (excluding residents of south Australia) and Singapore are being targeted.

 Oracle will spend about $4,14,000 to ferry the winners to space. It has joined hands with Space Adventures Ltd., the worlds leading space experiences company, for this venture.

 Eric Anderson, president and CEO of Space Adventures, said: We are extremely excited to partner with Oracle this exciting, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be among the first private citizens in space.

 In recent years, weve seen a growing interest in commercial space travel from the Asia Pacific region and now, through the Oracle Space Sweepstakes, a lucky contestant will fly to the edge of space.

 Krishan Dhawan, managing director, Oracle India Pvt. Ltd, said: We are the only vendor that allows newer Java developers to quickly become productive while minimising tedious low-level coding for more experienced developers.

 This Sweepstakes highlights these features and challenges developers to win an opportunity that is literally out of this world.

 Apart from the sub-orbital flight, Oracle is giving away two Mac PowerBooks, five Apple iPods and 10 Star Wars trilogy DVD sets in the final draw.

 Participants can register through the Oracle Space Sweepstakes homepage at http://oracle.com/space and take online quizzes. One person is allowed only one entry.

 New topics will be rolled out every month, starting June and ending August. The Oracle Space Sweepstakes ends on 31 August. In September, a random draw from all eligible entries will be conducted for the Sweepstakes prizes.

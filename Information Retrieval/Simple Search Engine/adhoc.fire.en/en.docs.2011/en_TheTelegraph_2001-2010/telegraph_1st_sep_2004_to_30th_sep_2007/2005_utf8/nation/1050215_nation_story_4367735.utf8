 Purnea, Feb. 14: In a land where guns speak louder than poll rhetoric, it does not matter if the candidate is a gangster or his wife. 

 Welcome to Rupauli and Dhamdaha, where wives of dreaded criminals are gunning for poll glory along with a host of ?tainted? candidates.

 In Dhamdaha, the Janata Dal (United)?s Lacy Singh, widow of the dreaded Butan Singh, is locked in a fierce battle with the Samajwadi Party?s Neelam Singh, wife of another notorious figure, Buchan Yadav, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s Dilip Prasad Yadav. The RJD candidate and former MLA is accused in several murder cases, including that of Butan Singh.

 ?Neelam Singh openly threatened the people with dire consequences if they do not vote for her. Her husband was recently released from jail,? says Bijoy Mandal, a local JD(U) leader. 

 Bibhuti Choudhury, a resident of Dhamdaha, says: ?Here, jail, crime and guns are nothing new for ticket aspirants. Gone are the days of public representatives like Dinesh Singh or Surya Narayan Yadav.? 

 Alleging that the local gangs have unleashed a ?reign of terror?, he adds that landowners like him have no choice but to give in to their demand for extortion money.

 On the other hand, RJD block president Ginny Yadav accused the BJP and its allies for the criminalisation of politics in the region. ?Everything is all right in Lalooraj. People like Choudhury always make allegations without doing anything for the poor,? he says. 

 Aware of the consequences of opening their mouths, most people choose to remain silent on the crime-politics nexus. ?If you give our names in your articles, it will invite the wrath of the parties. You will leave this place tomorrow?we are the ones who will face the music,? says a voter.

 In Rupauli, an interesting battle is on the cards with at least three candidates having ?criminal? links. The self-styled ?chief? of the North Bihar Liberation Army, Shankar Singh, who faces nearly 100 criminal cases and is lodged in Purnea jail, is fighting on a Lok Janshakti Party ticket against the RJD?s Bima Bharati, whose husband Awadhesh Mandal is lodged in Madhepura jail.

 But it is the nomination of former Purnea MP Jai Krishna Mandal as an Independent candidate, which has sparked fear among voters. ?The name of Mandal continues to spread panic. He is the baap of all criminals,? says a voter. 

 Seema Devi, a close associate of Bharati, says: ?Guns will certainly not remain silent this time?we have to settle old scores.?

 Mandal and Bharati have started ?flexing? their muscles, as if to prove Seema right. In different parts of the constituency, supporters of the two candidates could be seen going around with weapons. ?More than 50 armed youths came on motorcycles and ordered us to vote for Bima Bharati. The following day, associates of Mandal displayed their weapons, including AK-47s, and asked us to elect their leader,? villagers allege.

 The Purnea superintendent of police, who recently held a meeting with his subordinates in Rupauli and Dhamdaha, expressed concern over the spiralling crime graph and said intelligence reports have hinted at widespread violence during the polls.

 ?Though the authorities are aware of the situation, they have not registered a single case of violation of the model code,? alleges Dinesh Yadav, a BJP worker.

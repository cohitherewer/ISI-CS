 Cong waits amp; watches the fun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: As the BJPs Madhya Pradesh soap unfolded with Uma Bharti leading the star cast, the Congress maintained that it would wait and watch.

 The Congress, the main Opposition in the state, said rather than go into the issue of victimisation of a woman from a backward caste, it would prefer to focus on the principals involved in it, such as how democratic norms were flouted when Shivraj Singh Chauhan was anointed chief minister.

 Initially we thought our response should centre around Uma Bharti, but later we felt rather than personalise the episode, we should stick to the politics of it, said a source.

 Sources said the Congresss attack will focus on the fact that Chauhan is the third chief minister in two years and that a party, which won a thundering mandate in 2003 on the bijli, sadak, paani (power, road and water) plank, was embroiled in in-house quarrels.

 In a statement issued in state capital Bhopal yesterday, former Congress chief minister Digvijay Singh said: The only question arising in peoples minds on the BJPs character is will the party be eternally preoccupied with who its chief minister will be? 

 The fight among its leaders has taken primacy over everything else and nobody is attending to governance and the people. They have no time for development and peoples welfare.

 But the party does not plan to go on the offensive yet. We have asked our workers to hold local-level meetings to purvey the message of non-governance, said a source.

 The source pointed out that if the Congress appeared too aggressive, it could reunite the state BJP leadership. Our attitude is let them slug it out and melt away slowly. We are in no hurry to change the course of events.

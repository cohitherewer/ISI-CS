 Patna, April 7: Siwan district magistrate C.K. Anil today issued an order of preventive arrest against senior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and MLA Shivanand Tiwari who plans to enter the district on Saturday despite being barred from doing so for two months .

 The order was issued under Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which empowers a police officer to arrest a person to prevent the ?commission of a cognisable offence?.

 Section 151(1) provides: ?A police officer knowing of a design to commit any cognisable offence may arrest, without orders from a magistrate and without a warrant, the person so designing, if it appears to such officer that the commission of the offence cannot be otherwise prevented.?

 However, according to Section 151(2), ?No person arrested under sub-section (1) shall be detained in custody for a period exceeding 24 hours from the time of his arrest unless his further detention is required or authorised under any other provisions of this Code or of any other law for the time being in force.?

 In a letter to the district magistrate, Tiwari had yesterday said, ?I think it to be my duty to disobey the dictates of an officer like you. I have, therefore, decided to leave for Siwan from my Patna residence at 10 am on April 9.?

 Anil is understood to have sent a communication to chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam as well as the district magistrates of Patna, Vaishali and Saran (Chhapra), informing them of Tiwari?s arrest orders. A person travelling to Siwan has to usually cross these districts, unless he decides to take a longer route.

 It is now certain that if not detained on the way, the RJD leader will definitely be arrested if he tries to enter Siwan. Interestingly, the district magistrate?s wife Shobha Ohatker, a no-nonsense IPS officer, is posted as the superintendent of police of Saran, adjoining Siwan. 

 Tiwari, meanwhile, remained defiant. ?There is no change in my stand and I will definitely go to Siwan on April 9. I think it to be my duty to disobey the dictatorial order of the district magistrate. I am ready to face any consequence for this,? he told The Telegraph.

 Anil had issued the order barring the former minister from entering Siwan after he gave an allegedly ?inciting? speech in the town on March 30 during a railway function presided over by RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.

 Tiwari today attended another railway function at Bihia near Arrah, where Laloo Prasad inaugurated a ticket counter. The former minister talked about his ?resolve? to enter Siwan at the function, which coincided with the death anniversary of his father and socialist leader Ramanand Tiwari.

 Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan had appreciated the decision taken by Anil. At the Bihia function, Laloo Prasad came down heavily on the LJP, calling it a party of criminals.

 In his three-page letter to Anil, the MLA had tried to rake up the ?controversies?, which have surrounded Anil?s tenure in Bihar.

 In his speech at Siwan, Tiwari had allegedly said Anil was ?trying to be smart? and that he would ?teach him a lesson?. The senior RJD leader has so far not denied making such statements.

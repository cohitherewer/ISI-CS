 Tomato key to sturdy crops

 G.S. MUDUR 

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: Plant biologist Akhilesh Tyagi, who contributed to the international rice genome sequencing effort, has turned his attention to tomato, sugarcane and a bacterium whose identity he wants to keep secret for the moment.

 India has joined the international tomato genome sequencing project. Tyagi, at the University of Delhis South Campus, and his colleagues have the task of deciphering all genetic alphabets that make up chromosome number five of tomato plants.

 Our long-term goals are tomatoes with a longer shelf life and tomatoes with better nutritional features, said Tyagi, the biologist who was part of the Indian research team that had sequenced half of a single chromosome ? number 11 ? of rice.

 More than 250 researchers from 10 countries had participated in the international rice genome sequencing project that has generated a high quality sequence for rice, a plant that is the staple for more than half the worlds population.

 We want to use the facilities that we created for rice to sequence the genomes of other organisms, said S. Natesh, adviser in the department of biotechnology that has spent Rs 48 crore on genome sequencing infrastructure over the past five years.

 Under the tomato sequencing effort, Delhi University South Campus and two other institutions will sequence chromosome 11 completely. The tomato belongs to a unique family of plants called solaneceae whose other members include coffee, eggplant, lettuce and pepper among dozens of others. Some genomes extracted from tomato would also apply to some of these other plants.

 Tyagi said that in addition to sequencing, the research effort will also focus on finding genes that would allow tomato plants to stay fresh longer and genes that increase the level of lycopene, an important constituent of tomatoes that is believed to combat cancer.

 Indian researchers have also initiated efforts to sequence the full genome of a bacterium but have declined to name the organism. We dont want others to leap ahead and beat us to it, a senior biotechnology official said. All that researchers involved in the project are willing to say now is that it is a bacterium that has potential applications in medicine.

 Natesh said the complete genome sequence of the bacterium would be announced within a year.

 In their pursuit of crop genomics, Indian scientists also plan to sequence sugarcane and have begun discussions for a collaborative project with Brazil for sequencing coffee. 

 Through sequencing and gene-hunting research, scientists hope to discover special genes that allow plants to grow in conditions of stress such as low water or to combat diseases.

 The genes identified through the completed rice genome sequence might help scientists extend their studies to related cereals such as wheat and maize.

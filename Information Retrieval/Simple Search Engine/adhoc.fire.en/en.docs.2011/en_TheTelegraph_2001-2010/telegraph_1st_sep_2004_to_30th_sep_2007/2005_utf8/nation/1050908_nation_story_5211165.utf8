 Jaya faces trespass heat

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Jaya: Encroacher?

 Bhopal, Sept. 7: The cost of crossing swords with the Gandhis may have been brought home to Jaya Bachchan, literally.

 Some structures the actor had built on open space in front of her ground-floor flat are set to be demolished by the citys Congress-ruled corporation.

 A court here dismissed a plea by Jaya and 10 others seeking an injunction against the corporation tearing down the boundary wall and sheds.

 The structures had been built by ground-floor residents of the three-storey block of flats facing Bhopal Lake. 

 Civil judge Renuka Kanchan ruled that prima facie, they had been erected illegally and the civic authorities could pull them down if they so wished. She held that residents of flats on the other floors, too, had a right to the open grounds.

 The ruling earned Jaya scornful comments from the state Congress spokesperson. Manak Aggarwal scoffed at the high and mighty Samajwadi Party MPs efforts to encroach on government land.

 Its extremely unfortunate that those pretending to champion social causes and rights are unashamedly violating rules and regulations, Aggarwal said. The BMC (Bhopal Municipal Corporation) must act swiftly, demolish (the) unauthorised constructions and impose penalty, too, if required.

 Aggarwals attack on Jaya ? who does not live in Bhopal ? is being seen in state political circles as an attempt to settle scores with the MP for her recent remarks slighting Sonia Gandhi.

 Jaya had reportedly mocked Sonia for her alleged habit of waving her hand like a car wiper and on another occasion, she had accused the Congress president of having betrayed the Bachchans. The second remark had prompted a rejoinder by Rahul Gandhi, who had virtually accused the actor of lying.

 The Congress props up the Samajwadi Party-led government in Uttar Pradesh and in return receives outside support for its United Progressive Alliance ministry at the Centre, but relations between the two parties has long been tense with barbs exchanged at the slightest opportunity.

 The Bhopal apartment is owned by Jaya and is occupied by her mother and sister. The actors father, the late Taroon Coomar Bhaduri, was a Calcutta newspapers special representative in Bhopal in the late 50s and 60s.

 Bhaduri was also an accomplished writer and a stage artiste. His Bengali novel, Abhishapta Chambal (Accursed Chambal), has been translated into several languages. Jaya had spent her student days in Bhopal, though not in this flat, before joining the Pune films institute.

 Two years ago, writer and social activist Arundhati Roy was involved in a similar row when a bungalow owned by her husband in the hill resort of Panchmarhi was found to be set in notified forest land. 

 Pradeep Kishan had bought the 4,346-sqft plot in 1994 but the Madhya Pradesh government won a lawsuit arguing that the Forest Act of 1972 banned the sale of land in notified forest areas.

 Arundhati, a vocal campaigner for the rights of Sardar Sarovar Dam oustees, a large number of them from Madhya Pradesh, had then faced sarcasm from those opposed to her politics.

 A state BJP leader had said that by encroaching on forest land, and by holding on to the property despite the knowledge, Roy had trampled on the rights of hundreds and thousands of animal species who did not have an Arundhati Roy to speak for them.

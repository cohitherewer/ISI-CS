 Calcutta, Aug. 3: The Board of Control for Cricket in India is padding up for a fresh innings on the telecast rights issue, leaving behind a year of controversies and legal wrangles.

 The marketing committee of the highest cricket governing body in the country is scheduled to meet in Delhi tomorrow to lay down the ground rules for floating a new tender for telecast rights on cricket played in India.

 The committee comprises board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra, five vice-presidents, the secretary, joint secretary, treasurer, previous president Jagmohan Dalmiya and Punjab Cricket Association president I.S. Bindra.

 The marketing committee will discuss aspects of a draft tender that has been framed, Dalmiya said today. 

 According to sources, the new tender document is likely to include all international cricket played in the country for the next five years (2006 to 2010), besides a series against Sri Lanka in November 2005. 

 The earlier tender, subsequently cancelled by the BCCI, was for cricket events between 2004 and 2008.

 The new tender is also likely to contain clearer clauses on the eligibility of the bidders, since lack of clarity in the earlier tender had led to lengthy legal battles involving the BCCI and private broadcasters like Zee Telefilms and ESPN-STAR Sports.

 The idea this time is to make things clear from the start so that there is no chance of litigation later, said a senior BCCI official. We will certainly give the rights to the highest bidder but it must be clearly ascertained who is best qualified to bid.

 Last time, sections within the cricket governing body had questioned how Zee, which did not have cricket production or telecast experience, could be awarded the rights after it emerged the highest bidder with $308 million.

 Sources also suggested that the new tender is certain to have clauses to shut out Zee. 

 Litigation on the last tender had dragged on till May 2005, when the Supreme Court finally dismissed Zees petition challenging a Madras High Court order that upheld BCCIs cancellation of the tender process.

 The reach of the broadcaster will be an important factor, too. 

 It doesnt make sense to consider a broadcaster with a reach of only 25 per cent. The Television Ratings Points (TRP) can come in handy in this case, the BCCI official added.

 According to Zee, which launched its sports channel recently, it is waiting for the tender to be made public before deciding on its future course of action.

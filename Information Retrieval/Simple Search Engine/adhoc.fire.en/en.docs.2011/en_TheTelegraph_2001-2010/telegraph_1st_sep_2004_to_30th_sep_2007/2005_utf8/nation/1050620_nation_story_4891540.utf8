 I adore RSS, says Mahajan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 19: BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan clarified today that he had not uttered a single word against RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan in any interview. 

 Mahajan said he could not imagine saying the words attributed to him. He said he had not given any formal interview on the subject to anyone. Mahajan added that he had met a group of journalists a few days ago and discussed the political situation in general terms. 

 There was no formal interview of any kind and, therefore, no quotes could be ascribed to him.

 Let me make it crystal clear that I have not given any interview to your newspaper or for that matter any other newspaper in the recent past, Mahajan claimed. 

 He expressed shock and surprise to see quotes in the form of questions and answers. Mahajan said the discussion had been completely misunderstood and the quotes attributed to me are totally false.

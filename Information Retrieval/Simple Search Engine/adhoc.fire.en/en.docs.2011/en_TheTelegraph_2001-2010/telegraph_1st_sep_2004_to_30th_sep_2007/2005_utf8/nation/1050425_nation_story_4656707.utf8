 Guns go missing, cops look clueless

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, April 24: Police, tasked to protect society, are having a tough time protecting their service weapons from vanishing in Punjab. 

 Information gleaned from the Punjab police headquarters revealed that cops cutting across all grades in the force have reported losing their weapons. Worse still, the policemen reporting the losses are going virtually unpunished. 

 In the last four years, Punjab policemen have lost as many as 14 weapons. There have been no recoveries so far. The cops have now been told to protect their arms, not lose them.

 Last year, DIG Parampal Singh lost his .32 bore revolver, costing over Rs 20 lakh, from his private car. He had stopped for refreshments at Kurali, 30 km from here, and had left the revolver in the car. Investigations into the disappearance have yielded nothing.

 According to regulations, cops losing their service weapons are liable to face punishment ranging from censure to sacking. Fines, ranging from Rs 200 to Rs 50,000 or more, are imposed. A three-member committee, looking into such cases, has to decide if its cost should be borne by an individual or the government.

 But in most cases the guilty officers have been let off with little or no punishment. One DSP Balbir Singh, who lost his .38 bore revolver, was fined just Rs 2,176. He had explained that the revolver disappeared from his room in the Batala police complex. But a sub-inspector was fined over Rs 20,000 for a similar offence.

 Constable Jagdish had lodged an FIR saying he had lost his revolver when he had gone to the Chandigarh home of another cop. He was excused. 

 Senior police officers are worried. ?The weapons can fall into the hands of terrorists. Disappearance of sophisticated weapons, like AK-47s, can cause major problems,? an officer said.

 In December 2002, an AK-47 did disappear. A Punjab police commandant reported that a member of his staff had lost the weapon in Gandhinagar. Luckily, the weapon was found in Surat from two acquaintances of the cop. The acquaintances had gone on a drive after the policeman entered a hotel, without realising that the weapon was in the vehicle.

 On finding the rifle, the acquaintances took the vehicle towards Surat, with the intention of leaving the AK-47 in a safe place. Oddly, the officer responsible for the loss lodged a complaint three days after the rifle disappeared. 

 DGP S.S. Virk is understood to have taken a serious view of the problem. Sources said the police chief is contemplating maximum penalty against the cops. 

 ?It is only the threat of dismissal that can put an end to the disappearances.... If we can?t protect our weapons how can we protect society?? an officer asked.

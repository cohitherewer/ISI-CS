The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cry for mercy silenced at Pak gates

 - India gains access to Sarabjit

 OUR BUREAU

 Aug. 26: Pakistan today responded to the swelling clamour for Sarabjit Singhs release, allowing Indian diplomats to meet the prisoner on death row for allegedly spying and setting off blasts.

 Foreign minister Natwar Singh had yesterday urged Pakistan envoy Aziz Ahmed Khan to consider if he could be granted clemency on humanitarian grounds as public sentiment was growing and to verify his familys claims that he was innocent.

 Pakistan has granted consular access to Sarabjit Singh and it is now up to the Indian diplomats as to when they want to see him, foreign ministry spokesman Naeem Khan said in Islamabad.

 The Indian high commission, which had sought access to him last week, had been informed they could meet Sarabjit who is housed in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore, he said.

 The announcement came hours before Pakistan Senates standing committee on foreign affairs was to meet to discuss Sarabjits case. 

 Indian diplomats, however, expressed disappointment that no dates had been mentioned. It is normal procedure that dates will be mentioned in response to consular access. Failure to mention dates means more delay, an official said.

 Although Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran confirmed in Delhi consular access had been granted, he said India was not prepared to go in for an exchange of prisoners if Sarabjit was pardoned.

 In Calcutta, veteran CPM leader Jyoti Basu said the Centre should step up efforts to secure his release.

 The government should step up the matter with Pakistan for his release. Sarabjit Singh should not be hanged, he said.

 Either he should be sent back to India or be given a life term.

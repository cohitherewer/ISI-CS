 Baby Noor: Showing the way

 New Delhi, March 8: After cricket, it is the turn of medical diplomacy.

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss today said Indian and Pakistani doctors can help improve ties across the border. ?The medical fraternity of India and Pakistan can play a pivotal role in improving relations and infusing trust between people of the two countries,? he said while inaugurating an international conference, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and attended by over a hundred US-based Pakistani doctors.

 The Association of Pakistani Physicians of North America and the CII are the moving spirits behind the effort to use medical diplomacy to foster friendship between the neighbours. The theme of the conference ? ?Building bridges: people to people through medicine? ? said it all.

 A year-and-a-half ago, Baby Noor had shown the way. The little Pakistani girl who came to India for a heart operation got get-well cards from people across the nation. Since then, several Pakistani children have come to India for treatment.

 Realising that such moves can generate spontaneous goodwill on both sides, he spoke of furthering these contacts through real time cooperation between doctors in the subcontinent.

 ?As we are planning to launch a rural health mission in a big way, there is lot to learn from Pakistan for they have a considerably good system in place,? Ramadoss said.

 ?The country is progressing towards becoming a developed nation.... We should identify more areas of cooperation in the health sector between the two countries and achieve the distinction collectively,? the minister added.

 Ramadoss outlined the vision of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. ?My ministry firmly believes that while we provide healthcare which is comparable to the very best in the world there is a vast majority who lives in our towns and villages who cannot even afford basic healthcare,? he said.

 The Pakistani physicians? association is keen to ensure better cooperation between private sector doctors. The aim is to foster peace through medicine. The visitors will be in Mumbai on March 14 and 15 to meet physicians and to share the latest developments in oncology.

 Ramadoss, a firm believer in private-public participation in healthcare, promised industry leaders that the government would provide a stable environment so that India could become an integrated healthcare destination.

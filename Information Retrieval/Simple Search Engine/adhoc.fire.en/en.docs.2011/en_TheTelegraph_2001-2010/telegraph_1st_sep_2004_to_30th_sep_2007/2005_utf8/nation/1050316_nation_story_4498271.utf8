 Twin tusker trails converge in Kerala

 Thiruvananthapuram, March 15: This could be sheer coincidence ? one team filming the single largest herd of trained elephants and another trying to track an elusive species of pygmy elephants, both in Kerala.

 A National Geographic-sponsored team spent three days at Guruvayur in Thrissur filming 63 trained elephants that are in the service of the famed Sri Krishna temple.

 The elephant trail had taken the team to the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh and then to Bihar, before it landed here to film the tuskers at the anakotta (elephant house) in Thrissur. The National Geographic channel is expected to beam the tusker story later this year.

 ??This (Thrissur) is the only place in the world where so many trained domestic elephants can be seen together. Since the theme of our production is based on the complexity of an elephant?s mind and its relationship with humans, we chose this place as the ideal location for our documentary,? said the Granada Productions? documentary producer-director Steve Gooder and associate producer-director Allison Bean.

 The shots of the trained elephants in Thrissur will be juxtaposed with those of the wild ways of their counterparts in Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh. The shots include the behaviour of an elephant in musth, how it takes offence at the sight of another tusker but gently submits to commands of its mahout. 

 But it is uncertain whether the ecologists? team from Bangalore?s Indian Institute of Science and the officials of the state?s forest department, who are on the pygmy tusker trail, would be successful in establishing the presence of the new species. To date, there is no material evidence to prove the existence of dwarf elephants. They only exist in tribal lore. 

 Recently, amateur wildlife photographer Salim Palode and Mannan Kani, a tribal, have claimed that they saw a group of six elephants, around five feet in height, at a clearing close to the Peppara sanctuary here. They claimed it was a new species close to the dwarf elephants, which are known as kallaana in the local language.

 The ecologists from IISc, with forest officials are now scouring the Western Ghats for the dwarf tuskers. They plan to do a DNA mapping that will either confirm or rule out the presence of the species in Indian forests. Scientists said a DNA study from dung samples, which the IISc has developed, is the first of its kind to be used for solving a mystery of this sort. It will help in deciphering the general structure of the Indian tuskers.

 But experts are divided on the presence of the species. 

 Raman Sukumar, an associate professor at the IISc, ruled out that the newly-sighted ?little? jumbos could be described as new species or even a sub-species. 

 He said the elephants, though smaller than the average size, could be a mere variation within a species. 

 ?I?m not rubbishing the claims of those who have seen the herd,? said Sukumar, who is also the chairman of the Asian Elephant Special Group. 

 Some scientists believe that the pygmy elephants could be calves, but this possibility was ruled out as the animals were not accompanied by herd elders.

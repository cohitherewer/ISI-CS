 Bardhan keeps front on hold

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 22: CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan today said the Left parties are not in favour of toppling the Congress-led UPA government to make way for the BJP.

 However, Bardhan, who was addressing the Samajwadi Party?s national convention as a guest, provided some music for Mulayam Singh Yadav?s ears. He said the Left has not signed a ?permanent agreement? for supporting the UPA from outside and that a third front ?will be ultimately formed?.

 ?The UPA government has done good work on the agricultural front,? the CPI leader said, but added that its finance minister (P. Chidambaram) is in the habit of chanting ?FDI, FII?.

 Bardhan reiterated that the UPA government must work according to the letter and spirit of the common minimum programme. 

 He said a few supermarkets and shopping malls are no indication of development and the real focus should be on protecting the interests of the poor.

 Bardhan said it is important to identify one?s friends and foes. ?We can be opponents at some places but we need not be enemies,? he said in an indirect reference to the Congress.

 The CPI veteran heaped praises on the Samajwadi Party. ?It was the first to offer support to an anti-BJP government at the Centre, that too without any invitation? But for the Samajwadi Party, it was impossible to decimate the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. Obviously, a third front will be ultimately formed because we have to guard against communalism and anti-people economic policies.?

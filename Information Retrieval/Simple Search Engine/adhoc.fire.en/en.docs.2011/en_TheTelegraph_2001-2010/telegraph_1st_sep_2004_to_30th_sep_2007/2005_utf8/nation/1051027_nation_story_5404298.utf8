 Nuke deal test begins

 Singh, Bush: Countdown 

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: The US Congress will begin a crucial hearing tomorrow on the civilian nuclear deal Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed with President George W. Bush in July this year.

 Washington needs Congress approval to bring about changes in US domestic law that will allow India access to American civilian nuclear and other sophisticated technologies.

 Congresss foreign relations committee had last met on September 8. Thursdays hearing will be the first after US under-secretary Nicholas Burnss visit to India.

 At the hearing, secretary of state Condoleezza Rice will testify before members of Congress and explain why the US should modify its laws to provide India access to the sophisticated technologies.

 Indications are that the Congress members will include Henry Hyde and many others opposed to the Bush administrations move.

 This section in the US Congress argues that the proposed changes to the long-standing US policy threaten to undermine the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and global non-proliferation efforts. 

 The foreign relations committee of the US senate is to start its hearing on the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal next week.

 There are more than 500 members of our Congress and there are some members and some staff members who have doubts about it (the Indo-US nuclear deal). There are some who are opposed, Burns had said last week.

 We are a democratic country, as is India. So you will recognise this is a national debate on an important issue.

 Burnss attempt to play down the opposition in the US Congress notwithstanding, there is increasing concern in America about Indias growing ties with Iran. 

 At the last hearing of the US Congress in September, several members had questioned foreign minister K. Natwar Singhs visit to Tehran at a time when most world leaders were avoiding an official visit to the West Asian nation.

 Both Delhi and Washington have argued that the civilian nuclear deal between them should not be linked to Indias vote at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Irans nuclear programme.

 But going by the concerns raised at the last hearing of the US Congress, it is clear that many US lawmakers are not convinced. This means the stand Delhi is likely to take at the IAEA meeting on Iran next month will be crucial to secure their nod on the nuclear deal.

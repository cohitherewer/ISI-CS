 New Delhi, Nov. 18: The Indian and US navies are drawing up a plan for complex joint drills that will include testing multi-mission capability and exercises among their special forces. 

 The Indian Navys Marine Commandos (Marcos) and US Navy Seals will revive contacts and carry out mock interception drills in the high seas sometime next year.

 The apex body that oversees relations between the two navies met this week. The naval executive steering group meeting was co-chaired by the Vice-Admiral J.S. Bedi, Indias deputy chief of naval staff, and Vice-Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, the commander-in-chief of the US Navys Seventh Fleet based in Yokosuka, Japan.

 Indian Navy sources said the exercises would focus on search and seizure operations. Naval headquarters is loath to divulge much information on the Marcos. Some of the officers and men of its first batch were indeed trained in US military establishments. A detachment of 32 Marine Commandos is posted at the Wullar Lake in Kashmir for counter-terrorism operations. It has also undertaken overseas assignments, the latest of which was to clear choked channel of the Galle harbour in Sri Lanka after last Decembers tsunami.

 These Marcos-Seals drills may be combined with a more complex exercise than Malabar 2005, which saw the two navies deploying aircraft carriers for the first time. Cross-deck landings and enhanced drills in anti-submarine warfare using the US Navys E2C Hawkeye were possible.

 A navy spokesman said one of the issues discussed in the meeting was a Common Operational Plot. This will lead to equipping elements of the two navies with abilities for joint action, measures for speedy communication and transfer of operational information.

 Parivar truce hunt begins 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, April 13: With the war in the Sangh parivar out in the open, efforts are on to broker some kind of a ?truce? between BJP president L.K. Advani and RSS sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan.

 RSS sources said Sudarshan and Advani could meet when the former is in Delhi for four days from April 20 as part of a ?pre-scheduled? tour.

 ?There is no formality in this. They are senior members of the same family and if one wishes to call on the other, what is the problem?? asked sources. 

 Sources close to Advani refused to confirm or deny that such a rapprochement was in the offing: ?Something could take place. Nothing is final yet. When it happens, the media will be duly informed,? said a source.

 It is learnt that the ?side? players in the RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the BJP were advised to remain reticent and not add ?fuel to fire? but allow the ?flames to be doused?. 

 RSS general secretary Mohanrao Bhagwat and spokesman Ram Madhav who issued clarifications on the Sangh?s ?behalf? after Sudarshan said Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee should make way for younger leaders, were reportedly asked for an explanation from the supremo as to why the ?clarifications? ended up sounding like ?contradictions?. 

 Sources said Bhagwat?s reported explanation was that he was told by certain BJP functionaries, interceding on Advani?s behalf, this was the ?only damage-control move available on hand? and that the issue of the ?big two? retiring from public life would be ?taken up in the near future?.

 Another meeting of the RSS-BJP coordination committee is slated to take place on April 22. 

 Sources said Sudarshan will not be present but Bhagwat and the newly-appointed political pointperson, Sureshrao Soni (who replaced Madan Das Devi), will. 

 The BJP will be represented by Advani, his general secretaries and his factotum, M. Venkaiah Naidu. Sources, however, added the meeting would happen only if the ?ice-breaker? one between Advani and Sudarshan preceded it.

 The RSS is believed to be ?upset? over reports of how Sudarshan was ?isolated? within his own organisation and suspected they were ?planted? by sections of the BJP ?wanting to settle old scores with the sarsanghchalak?.

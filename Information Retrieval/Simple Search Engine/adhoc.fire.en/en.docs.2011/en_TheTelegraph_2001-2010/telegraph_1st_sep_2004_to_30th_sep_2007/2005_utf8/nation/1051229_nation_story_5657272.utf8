 New Delhi, Dec. 28: The record attached to the name of the MV Eugenia, the ship from which explosives meant to build roads in Afghanistan went missing, is dubious.

 In July, a ship by the same name carrying about 300 tonnes of arms and ammunition was escorted by the Coast Guard to Mormugao, where it had earlier docked, because of reports that it was sinking. The authorities found the cargo to be legitimate and let the ship go.

 In early September, the Calcutta Port Trust also detained the ship at the Kidderpore docks. It was carrying arms and ammunition from Yugoslavia for Bangladesh and Indonesia and iron pipes for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. The pipes were unloaded in Calcutta. 

 A rupture in the hull of the ship was being repaired in the docks. The authorities again checked with the Indonesian government and the ship was escorted out of Indian territorial waters by the Coast Guard.

 This time, the ship has been towed back to Mumbai after it was found that the explosives had disappeared.

 Investigators are working on the agent that booked the cargo for the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), an arm of the Indian military for which the explosives were being despatched to Afghanistan, on the Eugenia. 

 A BRO official said till the consignment was delivered, the organisation could not take responsibility for it. He said the order for 100 tonnes of the explosive was placed with the Secunderabad-headquartered Premier Explosive Limited with requisite clearances of the chief controller of explosives. 

 The consignment was to be unloaded at the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas and transported by road to the project site in Afghanistan. At the BRO headquarters in Delhi, the feeling that Afghanistan is a costly project is inescapable.

 Its director-general, Lt General K.S. Rao, has just returned from Zaranj-Delaram, where it is building a road, following the killing of its worker Maniappan Raman Kutty by suspected Taliban.

 Islamabad, May 10: Bollywood classic Mughal-e-Azam is set to be screened in Pakistani theatres soon but a date for its release is yet to be announced.

 ?We havent finally decided when the film should be released,? information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad told The Telegraph in Islamabad today.

 President Pervez Musharraf has written to Akbar Asif, director of the reproduced Mughal-e-Azam, confirming that a decision in principle has been taken to allow the release of the movie in Pakistan, a representative of Asif recently said.

 Originally released in 1960, the movie had put its director, Akbar Asifs father K. Asif, among the all-time greats of Hindi cinema.

 Akbar Asif had met President Musharraf in London last year and presented him with a coloured celluloid copy of the original 1960 movie, which was made on a black-and-white tape.

 ?It (the decision to screen the film in Pakistani theatres) will further strengthen relations and understanding between people on either side of the border and help cement relations between the two countries,? Asif said recently in London.

 The information minister, however, said the government is not considering any proposal to allow screening of Indian movies in Pakistan in general to meet the increasing demands from film distributors in the country.

 Sheikh Rashid was commenting on reports about the recent meetings between government officials in Islamabad and two delegations from Lahore ? one from the Cinema Owners Association and the other from the Film Producers Association ? who sought permission to screen five Indian films in exchange for five Pakistani films being shown in India.

 They said that if the government banned Indian movies on cable television and allowed five Indian films to be screened in cinemas, they would be willing to pay a 150 per cent entertainment tax, enabling the government to earn Rs 30 crore to Rs 50 crore every year from Punjab alone.

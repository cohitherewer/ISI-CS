 Geelani turns down Islamabads bus invite

Srinagar, May 29: Hardline Hurriyat leader 

Syed Ali Shah Geelani today turned down Islamabads invitation to the separatists 

to visit Pakistan on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus on June 2.

 Geelanis camp had decided not to go to Pakistan as the visit would be futile and not result-oriented, the Hurriyat leader said after an extended session of the hardline faction of the organisation.

 The visit had been discussed for two days, Geelani said. A consensus emerged that undertaking the travel on June 2 would not help find a lasting and permanent solution to the Kashmir problem. The problem lies in Kashmir and not in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. So, we have decided that we will not go there on June 2, the Hurriyat leader said.

 Geelani welcomed the spirit of President Pervez Musharrafs invitation but wanted the country to stop giving too many concessions on Kashmir. Pakistan should stop conceding ground to India, he said.

 Islamabad had earlier faxed invitations to all the senior separatist leaders to visit the country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on June 2 so that some dialogue could be initiated to resolve the Kashmir issue.

 The moderate faction of the Hurriyat, headed by Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, has accepted the invitation and already announced a five-member visiting team. 

 The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front has also given its nod and its chairman, Mohammad Yasin Malik, will lead a 17-member delegation on June 2.

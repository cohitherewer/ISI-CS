 Kidnap fury spills on to streets

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Feb. 16: Away on election campaign in Ajnala, chief minister Amarinder Singh came under attack as public fury mounted in Hoshiarpur, 150 km away, a day after kidnapped schoolboy Abhi Verma?s body was found in a canal.

 A tense Hoshiarpur shut down today following a bandh called by the BJP and the local bar association to protest the murder. Demonstrators pelted cars and shops in some areas, forcing the district administration to deploy riot squads. Special prayer meetings were held at some places.

 ?The law and order machinery has completely collapsed in Punjab. Instead of coming here to pacify angry residents and take the police to task for their failure to trace the kidnappers immediately, Amarinder is addressing rallies in Ajnala, warning people not to indulge in violence during polling day,? Hoshiarpur BJP MP Avinash Rai Khanna said. BJP workers also surrounded the local police station.

 Amarinder is campaigning for the February 23 bypoll to the Ajnala parliamentary constituency in Amritsar.

 The Shiromani Akali Dal has sought Amarinder?s resignation. 

 ?The chief minister spares no time in letting loose his police against Opposition leaders and workers. Abhi?s abductors should have been arrested immediately. But it seems the police were waiting for Amarinder?s nod whether to go after the kidnappers or give them time to flee the district. Punjab has never had a history of kidnappings,? Shiromani Akali Dal leader and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal said.

 Enquiries revealed that the police were informed within five minutes of the kidnap by witnesses, but acted more than three hours later. 

 Moreover, despite a ?red-alert? in Punjab, Haryana and even Himachal Pradesh, the police failed to stop the abductors, Vikramjit and Jasvir, who were in a Chevrolet, from crossing the special checkpoints on the road to Alwalpur, a village in adjoining Jalandhar district, where Abhi?s body was dumped.

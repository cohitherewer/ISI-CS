 ASI scripts court strategy on Taj

 Taj Mahal: Who owns it?

 Lucknow, July 14: A 350-year-old Mughal manuscript, written in Persian and lying in a London library, is the focus of interest as the Taj Mahal ownership controversy heads for Allahabad High Court.

 The state Sunni Central Wakf Board had referred to the Badshahnamah ? an account of emperor Shah Jahans rule by his paid chronicler Abdul Hamid Lahori ? to justify its declaration of Taj Mahal as Wakf property yesterday.

 The board had accepted petitioner Mohammed Irfan Bedaris contention that, according to the manuscript, Shah Jahan had bequeathed the Taj as Wakf property.

 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), set to appeal against the verdict in the high court, will seek a directive to the Wakf board to produce proof ? perhaps in the form of photocopies of the relevant pages of the Badshahnamah, attested by the library where it lies.

 Board chief Hafiz Usman admitted he did not have access to the manuscript, but he had checked and cross-checked the matter and gone through copies of pages. Usman didnt clarify if the copies were photocopies and whether the pages were of the Mughal manuscript itself or of later book versions of it.

 ASI sources said senior officials have collected several such books which vary in their text.

 When we dont know what exactly is written in the original Badshahnamah, how can the Wakf board rely so much on the petitioners version of the book? asked ASI official S.K. Sharma.

 The Badshahnamah has gained the status of a Mughal classic and many Indian scholars, backed by the Centre, have been lobbying in Britain for years to have it back in India.

 The ASI has another argument for the high court: once a monument is registered as Wakf property, its maintenance is hobbled by board members interference.

 The dargah of Sheikh Salim at Fatehpur Sikri, about 37 km from Agra, had been encroached on by dozens of shops in connivance with Wakf board members, ASI sources said. It took a Supreme Court directive to the Agra administration, on a petition filed by a local citizen, to free the red-stone wonder of squatters.

 Hordes of encroachers have invaded the Imambarah in Agra after its registration with the Wakf board. They have virtually choked the entrance passage and blocked the view of the gate.

 The board yesterday decided the Taj was originally a graveyard, accommodating the graves of Shah Jahan, Mumtaz, another of the emperors wives and those of two of Mumtazs friends.

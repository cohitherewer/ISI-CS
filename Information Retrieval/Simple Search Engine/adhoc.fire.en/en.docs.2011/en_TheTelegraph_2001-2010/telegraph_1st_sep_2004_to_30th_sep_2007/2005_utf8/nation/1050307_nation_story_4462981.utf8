 Cross-country drive against polluters 

 JAYANTA BASU

 Stop the smoke 

 Calcutta, March 6: The Centre has ordered all states and Union territories to immediately close down industrial units operating in violation of environment laws.

 The order was communicated on Friday to different state boards by Central Pollution Control Board chairman V. Rajagopalan.

 It says: ?In exercise of its powers conferred under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, all state governments and Union territories have been asked to immediately close down units operating in violation of environment laws.?

 Besides ordering closure of industrial units already identified, ?the central government further directs that it shall be the responsibility of every state government and Union territory administration to also immediately identify all other defaulting units and ensure their closure forthwith?, the order adds.

 The directive is in accordance with a Supreme Court order in February directing the government ?to issue requisite order within 10 days directing closure of defaulting units? in connection with a writ petition filed by a non-government organisation, Goa Foundation.

 The apex court also directed the state governments ?to comply (with) the statutory directions issued by the Government of India? and asked the latter ?to file a compliance report within six weeks?.

 The petition filed by the non-government organisation condemned the way the government had continued to allow polluting industries to operate violating its own order, which dates back to mid-nineties.

 ?Way back in 1994, the central government ordered, save aside the production, even certain industrial activities and mining cannot be allowed if proper environment impact assessment (EIA) reports are not prepared. The government sat on it for four years and then issued another circular in 1998 asking the defaulters to apply with retrospective effect within March 1999. All state boards were also asked to serve notices to such units. Nothing happened,? said the petitioner?s advocate, Raj Panjwani.

 The Centre then issued two similar notices and fixed fresh deadlines in 2001 and 2003, but no significant progress was made. 

 ?Many industries did not apply and the majority of those who applied, did not send completed forms. Naturally, the EIA committees could not process those applications. The government chose to look the other way and the defaulter units continued to operate unabated,? the petitioner?s counsel said. 

 According to the affidavit submitted by the Centre, the ?soon to be closed list? has about 70 industrial units and 168 mines, Panjwani said. 

 ?If the Supreme Court and the central government choose to follow the issue seriously, as happened in case of the famous Ganga pollution case filed by M.C. Mehta, this case may prove to be a watershed in the country where industrial priorities far outweigh the environmental concerns,? said an official of the environment department in Bengal.

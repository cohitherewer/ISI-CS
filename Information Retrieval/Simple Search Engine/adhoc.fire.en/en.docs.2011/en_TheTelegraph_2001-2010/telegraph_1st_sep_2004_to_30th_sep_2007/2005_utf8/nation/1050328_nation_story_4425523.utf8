 Jha: On a mission

 Bettiah, March 27: A man known for his skills behind the megaphone has his hands full with the resurrection of a once-famous hospital in West Champaran.

 Last year, director Prakash Jha of Gangaajal fame had to eat humble pie in the parliamentary elections. Some say Jha felt humiliated when his ?own? rejected him and questioned his credentials for contesting the polls from Bettiah. 

 ?Perhaps, some voters didn?t recognise him while he was campaigning and raised questions over his contributions. Then, Jha made up his mind to show the people that he belonged to them and cared for them,? said a resident of Barharwa, Jha?s ancestral village.

 The director then decided to reach out to the people ? for reasons best known to him ? and what better way to do it than reviving an ailing hospital.

 King Edward and Lady Dufferin Hospital, set up by the British in Bettiah town towards the end of the 19th century, was razed to the ground by an earthquake in 1934. It was rebuilt in a few years? time. Later, it was renamed Maharani Janaki Kuer Hospital but the local people, who had seen its ?decline?, mockingly called it the ?mazaaku? hospital.

 The ailments are many ? dearth of doctors and other staff, lack of funds, poor stock of medicines and ill-management.

 The hospital has only nine doctors of the sanctioned strength of 24 and 45 Grade-IV employees out of over a hundred posts. There are no plans of immediate appointments.

 After Jha began his crusade four months ago, his NGO Prakash Seva Kendra has spent a few lakhs on the renovation of the hospital. Cleanliness and electricity, two of the biggest casualties, have reappeared and a generator runs for most of the day.

 Patients are no longer required to buy candles along with medicines to be taken to the operation theatre. Earlier, doctors used to perform operations with a torch or kerosene lamp. Jha organised a ?kar seva? a few months ago and employed some people as part of a drive to keep the hospital clean.

 The filmmaker, when contacted in Mumbai, said: ?Money is not a problem. It is a humanitarian cause and not social service. I want to do more than only make films.?

 Jha rubbished the allegation that he had a political motive behind his efforts. ?Face-to-face interaction with the people during the election campaign opened my eyes to the realities there. If making a wrong right is a motivated act, then let it be so. After all, I am not robbing anyone. Of course, if things go well, I?ll contest the elections next time also. What?s the problem?? he reasons. 

 Corruption and malpractice are nothing new inside the hospital. The dirt, the staff members alleged, is right at the top with a section of them accusing hospital superintendent Banwari Lal of engaging in ?blatant corruption?. 

 Lal, on the other hand, takes credit for ?improving? matters in the hospital in collaboration with Jha. ?I am fully committed to the cause. But the people have to cooperate with us. And of course, the government has to do its job. We are badly understaffed and there is serious a dearth of facilities,? he said.

 Sources in the health department feels the hospital, like many others, is a victim of the Laloo-Rabri regime. ?It simply reflects the rot that existed in the 15-year misrule. Under President?s rule, the situation can improve,? an official said.

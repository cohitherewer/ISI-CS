 Arjun Munda put on leash

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: A temporary truce is what the BJP sought today when it announced the formation of two coordination committees in Jharkhand.

 One will serve as a link between NDA allies and the state government while the other will act as a bridge between the party (read dissidents) and the government. 

 Chief minister Arjun Munda, however, did not appear to be out of the woods yet.

 Whether the steps are sufficient to buy peace is unclear, what with two JD(U) ministers and some of the independent ministers still clamouring for a change of guard late today evening. 

 A section of the dissidents within the BJP also appeared unhappy at the solution. Each one of them met Sanjay Joshi and Rajnath Singh separately this morning before calling on party president L.K. Advani in the afternoon. 

 While mines minister Madhu Koda is likely to head one of the committees, the other is likely to be headed by former chief minister Babulal Marandi. 

 Koda was denied a BJP ticket in the last election and won as an independent and has been a bitter critic of the chief minister.

 With the two committees breathing down his neck, Mundas position is likely to become weaker and it appears to be a matter of time before the next crisis arrives.

 The BJP central leadership is clearly not in favour of any change and the party president is learnt to have expressed his annoyance at public criticism of the state government by party leaders.

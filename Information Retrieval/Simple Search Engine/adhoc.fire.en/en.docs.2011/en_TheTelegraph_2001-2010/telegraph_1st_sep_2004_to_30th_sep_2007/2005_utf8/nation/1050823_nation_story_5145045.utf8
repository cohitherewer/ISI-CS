 Andhra rethink on writer body ban

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Varavara Rao: Prisoner

 Hyderabad, Aug. 22: The Andhra Pradesh government is thinking of withdrawing the ban on the Revolutionary Writers Association in the wake of protests over last weeks arrest of the organisations president G. Kalyan Rao and fellow rebel spokesman P. Varavara Rao.

 Home minister K. Jana Reddy hinted as much today during his tour of Nalgonda district. The government will review the situation after a few months on the demand for rescinding the ban on the Virasam, he said.

 The Virasam ? as the writers association is known in Andhra ? is one of the organisations that were outlawed when the state government re-clamped its ban on the Communist Party of India (Maoist) last week. The arrests of Varavara Rao, its founder president, and Kalyan Rao followed two days later.

 If the home minister talked about revoking the ban, police were probing whether revolutionary folk singer Gaddar, one of the peace emissaries along with Varavara Rao and Kalyan Rao for the aborted Maoist-government talks, had links with any of the banned outfits. ?If we have proof of his involvement in any of the banned organisations, then we will take him into custody, said state police chief Swaranjit Sen.

 Prominent civil rights activist K.G. Kannabiran said it is, perhaps, the Prime Ministers reference to Gaddar in his speech at Hyderabad yesterday that has halted the balladeers arrest so long. Manmohan Singh had praised Gaddar for condemning the killing of innocent people by Maoist rebels.

 The ban on the Virasam, the intellectual wing of the Maoists, triggered a wave of protests from rights activists, poets, writers and the media. It is a ban on freedom of speech, said Olga (P. Lalitha Kumari), a prominent poet and writer.

 Gaddar has sent a memorandum to chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy urging him to reconsider the arrests. Whenever they want, the police and the government collude to build up cases against us. And whenever they dont want, they just drop all charges. Is this law and order? he said.

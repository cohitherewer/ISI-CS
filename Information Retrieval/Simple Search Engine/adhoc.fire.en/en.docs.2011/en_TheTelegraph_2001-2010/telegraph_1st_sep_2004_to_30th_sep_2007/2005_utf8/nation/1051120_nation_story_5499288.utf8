 Bihar relief for poll panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: The Election Commission had a reason to smile today as the Bihar Assembly elections ended without any major incident of violence.

 The voter turnout in the four-phase polls was put around 47 per cent, a fraction less than in February.

 Deputy election commissioner Arun Kumar said it was a very challenging election. However, he refused to compare it with the polls in Jammu and Kashmir. Every state is different.

 The final phase of the polls witnessed the maximum turnout ? 48 per cent. The voting pattern in the first three phases had been 44.84, 47.57 and 46.82 per cent. 

 The poll panel had made elaborate arrangements to check malpractice at polling stations. The entire exercise was filmed with digital cameras. In the fourth phase alone ? held in Patna, Siwan, Gopalganj and Nalanda districts ? nearly 4,000 cameras were used.

 Kumar said 322 people have been detained as a precautionary measure. They included an Independent candidate in the Chhapra area, a Samajwadi Party leader from Siwan and a Lok Janshakti Party candidate from Patna. 

 Around 20 people were taken into custody in the Bihar capital yesterday for carrying a country-made rifle and two pistols.

 Apart from the threat of bloodshed, a logistical challenge lay before the Election Commission ? to keep the electronic voting machines running. Kumar said there was no incident of any damage to the machines. 

 The mammoth poll process lasted more than two months, starting on September 9 when the elections were announced.

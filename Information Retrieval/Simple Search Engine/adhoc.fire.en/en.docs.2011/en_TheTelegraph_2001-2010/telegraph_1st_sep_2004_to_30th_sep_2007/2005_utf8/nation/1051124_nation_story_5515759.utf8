 Jail protection ring for don

 Mumbai, Nov. 23: Abu Salem was today sent to a jail infamous for gangland vendetta amid growing fears for his safety behind bars.

 Aware of the high risk inside Arthur Road Jail, which houses several members of Dawood Ibrahims gang with which Salem has apparently fallen out, the court said no inmate should come within 15 metres of the deported gangster. 

 The court has remanded Salem in judicial custody till December 7. The don looked furtively from the judge to the lawyers to the audience, avoiding eye contact and then looking away suddenly. 

 He appeared restless, moving back and forth continuously on his toes, embodying the fear that the CBI, his lawyers and the court deliberated on during the entire morning session. 

 After 12 days in CBI custody, he is said to have lost some weight. But in a black T-shirt and jeans, Salem could pass for a slightly ageing star from Bollywood with his sleek looks, had he not looked so troubled.

 Tada (anti-terror court) judge P.D. Kode said the remand report filed by the CBI suggested there was enough danger to Salems life.

 While the CBI objected strongly to the implication of the defences application that the agency itself was a threat to Salems life, it spoke of rival gangs.

 We have to take into account rival gangs, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, though he added that it was not possible to say anything specific.

 Arthur Road Jail, Mumbais oldest and largest prison, where Salem will be housed from today, is notorious for its inmates belonging to rival gangs. Several of its 2,200-odd inmates allegedly belong to Dawood Ibrahims gang. 

 Salem allegedly defected from Dawoods gang and Dawood is said to have his eyes on Salem. Three months ago, there was a bloody scuffle between members of the Dawood gang and the Chhota Rajan gang in Arthur Road Jail.

 The court looked at the report submitted by the CBI on the progress made in the 1993 Bombay blasts case and on the threats to Salems life, reportedly based on findings of central intelligence agencies.

 Given the serious nature of the revelations, the court directed that the report and the case diary be sealed, so that they are not accessible to anyone.

 The court had asked the CBI if it was ready to keep Salem in its custody in view of the security concern. The agency said it was not necessary. We have not completed the investigation, but police custody is not required now, said public prosecutor Nikam. But we reserve the right to seek further police custody. 

 The judge devoted some time to the place where Salem could be housed safely. Thane Jail came up, but since it is some distance from the Tada court, which is on the same premises as Arthur Road Jail, it was rejected. After a short discussion with Salem, defence lawyer Ashok Sarogi said the don was willing to be housed in Arthur Road Jail.

 However, the court said that the jail does not have any facility to lodge Salem independently. It then summoned jail authorities to discuss the issue.

 In Arthur Road Jail, he will be housed in a single cell. Shabana Shah, one of the lawyers, said Salem has been allowed home food and to meet his advocates daily. His brother, who is in the city, has also been allowed to see him daily. He is likely to carry the food.

 But Salem seems to be as afraid of the police as of rival gangs. He is frightened about moving into police custody.

 The gangster, against whom police will apply for a production warrant in the murder of film producer Pradeep Jain tomorrow, said he was scared of being handed over to the police. I am afraid of torture by the Crime Branch, he told the court.

 Salem gave the CBI men the clean chit. I have no complaint against any CBI officer.

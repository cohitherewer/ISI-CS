 Bid to keep Srinagar as capital

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: The Jammu and Kashmir government is likely to remain stationed in Srinagar this winter and not move southwards to a much cosier Jammu, breaking an annual ritual that has been in place since 1947. 

 According to a senior official, the state government is planning to take this step in the wake of the relief and rehabilitation operation that needs continuous monitoring for at least two to three months. 

 The government is also hoping to send a positive signal to Kashmiris, especially those who suffered losses in the October 8 earthquake, by keeping the winter capital in Srinagar.

 As the ongoing relief work needs to be constantly monitored by the state government, shifting the capital to Jammu can hamper the operation, an official said.

 The transfer ? a massive exercise ? usually takes place in November and the pace of work gets affected for about 10 to 15 days.

 Srinagar, close to the disaster zones of Baramulla, Uri and Tangdhar, is also a better place to coordinate the whole administrative exercise, the official added.

 A home ministry official said the proposal has been discussed but a final decision has yet to be taken.

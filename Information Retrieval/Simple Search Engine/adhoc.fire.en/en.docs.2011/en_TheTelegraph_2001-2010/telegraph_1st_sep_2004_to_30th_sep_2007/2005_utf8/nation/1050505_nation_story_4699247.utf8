 Call to dig out ?dead? soldier

 R.VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, May 4: The Supreme Court has in an unusual order asked the Centre to find out the whereabouts of a soldier declared killed in the 1971 war.

 ?Constable Surjit Singh of the Border Security Force has been declared to have died in the Indo-Pak war in 1971 (but) the petitioner (his wife Angrej Kaur), on the basis of certain materials, believes that he is alive and is languishing in Kot Lakhpat Rai jail in Pakistan,? a division bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and S.H. Kapadia said, directing the Indian authorities to take up the issue with Pakistan. 

 The judges said they could not issue a writ of habeas corpus (produce body) to a foreign authority, but could ask Indian officials to find out about Singh.

 Ordering the submission of an inquiry report within three months, the Supreme Court said: ?The authorities shall continue the efforts to find out the actual position and expeditiously intimate the petitioner the results of the efforts/inquiries made by them.?

 The petition ?presents some unusual features?, the judges said. 

 ?In mythology, Sati Savitri?s prayer ensured that her husband Satyaban escaped jaws of death?. In this case, they said, the petitioner-wife?s projection of the ?scenario runs in somewhat similar lines and at first flush may appear fictional?. 

 A writ of habeas corpus ?may appear to be unacceptable as the concerned person is stated to be in custody in a Pakistan jail, yet the petitioner?s human emotions refuse to accept this legal land line?, the judges said. 

 Hence, the apex court ordered the Indian authorities to find out the facts from Pakistan.

 ?It is not to be understood that we are issuing a writ of habeas corpus to any authority outside India. Our directions essentially relate to Indian officials. But it cannot be lost sight of that law cannot ever be a combination of meaningless and purposeless combination of words,? pointed out Justice Passayat, writing the judgment for the bench.

 ?If a soldier, while fighting for the country?s security, is captured and taken to other country?s prison contrary to the official belief that he was dead, it would be in the interest of not only the petitioner and her family members but also for the armed forces in the country to see that he is brought back to our country,? the ruling said. 

 ?The judicial system reaches its pinnacle when it serves the ultimate object of all laws; i.e. delivering justice to the recipient who deserves it, not shackled by the pitfalls and landmines of technicalities,? the court added.

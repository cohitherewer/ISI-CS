 Loot amp; surrender vow

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 17: Waylaying night buses is a way of life for Kokkala Raju. Hes done it 50 times earlier, and yesterday, and day before. But now, hes fed up and wants to call it quits.

 Karimnagars self-proclaimed Robin Hood last night pulled off yet another of his busjacking and looting dramas, ranted against police before his hostages, and then declared he was ready to surrender with honour.

 What to do, they wont let me live in peace. I have not harmed the poor but only the rich who have robbed the poorest of the poor, the 30-year-old boomed as he paced up and down the bus aisle, 36 frightened passengers watching on.

 I want all cases against me and my associates withdrawn. All of them should be absorbed in the police. I will surrender before a sitting judge of the high court, he continued.

 The Hyderabad-bound bus had set out at night from Karimnagar, 175 km away, and the first 45 minutes had been uneventful. But as the bus rolled through Vantimamidi, Raju and two accomplices struck.

 Wielding pistols and knives, they diverted the bus into the jungles nearby. Then they snatched passengers mobiles and flung them out, warning them not to alert the cops.

 They cannot catch me now. I will surrender only after three more robberies I am planning, he bragged as his mates stripped people of their ornaments and cash.

 But he took care to calm the women and children, telling them he would not harm a single hair on their heads. Then he asked his accomplices to return the womens mangalsutras. He also handed the men Rs 100 by way of incidental expenses. This is for your auto fare when you get down at Hyderabad.

 Nearly three hours later, the trio locked up the bus with the passengers inside and took off. They told the driver the keys would be kept at a spot 3 km away, which he could collect three hours from then.

 An agonising hour later, a passenger jumped out of the window, fished out his mobile from the pile on the ground and dialled the cops.

 Karimnagar SP D.S. Chauhan said four armed constables would be posted in night buses to avert such incidents.

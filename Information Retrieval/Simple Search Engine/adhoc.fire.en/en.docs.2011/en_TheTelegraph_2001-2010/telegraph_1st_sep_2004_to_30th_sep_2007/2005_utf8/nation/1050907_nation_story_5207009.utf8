The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No takers for optional Class X test

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Respite too far 

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The proposal to do away with Class X board examinations did not meet with much enthusiasm at the meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education which began here today to approve the framework for a new national curriculum.

 Most board members felt if the suggestion is implemented, it would lower the standard of education and of schools. They also voiced fears that examinations conducted by schools may not be treated on a par with board examinations.

 At present, students have to appear for board examinations after Class X and Class XII. Entry to colleges is on the basis of the Class XII results.

 The meeting also resonated with political differences. It saw a confrontation between the Centre and the BJP-ruled states, which refused to accept the new national curriculum framework, expected to come into effect from the next academic year in March.

 The National Council of Educational Research and Training, under Krishna Kumar, and 21 teams of experts have carried out an extensive exercise for putting together the new framework that experts say is more detailed and student-friendly than ever before.

 The two-day meeting of the central advisory board, an apex body on education, is expected to endorse the new framework that will replace the one drawn up in 2000 when the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was in power.

 The BJP today refused to accept the new framework, saying it is too modern and dismissive of Indias past. Education ministers from BJP-ruled states walked out of the meeting. The BJP had also boycotted the last meeting of the advisory board.

 A section of Left academics has also criticised the framework. At a seminar last month, historian Irfan Habib had said it was no different from the 2000 framework prepared under the guidance of then human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi and his close associate, former NCERT director J.S. Rajput.

 But the BJP did not find any similarity between the 2000 and 2005 documents. At todays meeting, its ministers trotted out a long list of complaints. The framework, they said, did not give Sanskrit the position of eminence it deserved. There was more emphasis on the present than the past. 

 The framework, they added, had no stress on morality. The students will not know anything about our glorious heritage. They will end up being selfish, said a BJP education minister.

 HRD minister Arjun Singh asked the BJP members not to take a confrontationist stand. But the ministers persisted with their complaints and walked out of the afternoon session.

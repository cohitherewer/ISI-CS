 Sonia amp; Singh pull off double act

 Chandigarh, Oct. 8: Twos company at the top: that was the message from the first joint news conference of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh.

 In the backdrop of the earthquake whose ripples were felt in Chandigarh, where the Congress has been reviewing the performance of its 15 chief ministers over the past two days, the question popped up: What about the quakes in the party with many epicentres?

 Are you talking about the BJP? Sonia shot back, even before the journalist had finished, drawing a roar of laughter that drowned the question.

 If the Congress president was in control at the half-hour session, the Prime Minister was at ease by her side as they together fielded questions.

 Asked about the response of chief ministers when he advised them to keep off political gimmicks like free power, Singh dead-panned: Woh sun rahe the (They were listening), drawing more laughs from the packed hall.

 The division of labour practised in Delhi was in evidence at Haryana Nivas ? Sonia took all the questions on party, Singh on government. When queries relating to governance, such as the one on sharing of resources between Punjab and Haryana, were put to the party chief, she passed them on.

 Only once did she appear to step in, whispering into Singhs ear as he started to reply in English to a question posed in Hindi. He switched to Hindi.

 The joint appearance was a surprise. Till the last minute, the party managers were saying only Sonia would address the media although initially they had planned a double act. The speculation was that the Prime Minister would avoid being quizzed on Bihar where the situation is still unclear.

 Sonia and Singh ? who have been the subject of speculation that they were not at ease with each other ? however, thought differently. While the Prime Minister did most of the talking on Bihar, Sonia pitched in. 

 Asked if in the context of the Bihar developments she thought the governor, like the President, should be apolitical, she was curt: I dont think Raj Bhavan is involved in politics.

 In keeping with the mood, they did not forget to thank each other ? Sonia, because the Prime Minister had taken time out for the party conclave and Singh, because she had given him the opportunity to brief the chief ministers on the Centres welfare programmes, in which they would have a role to play.

 The chief ministers got an unexpected message of reassurance from Sonia ? they are safe in their chairs. None of the chief ministers here are sitting on shaky chairs, the party chief declared in response to a question. It must have been music to the ears of most of them, just out of long quizzing sessions with the top leadership when the performance of their respective governments was reviewed.

 Since the last Lok Sabha elections, doubts have been raised about the longevity of some like Uttaranchals N.D. Tiwari, Manipurs Ibobi Singh, Punjabs Amarinder Singh and, more recently, Delhis Sheila Dikshit and Karnatakas N. Dharam Singh.

 For Ghulam Nabi Azad, tipped to join the chief ministers ranks soon, there was no reassurance, however. Is Azad being sent as chief minister to Jammu and Kashmir? someone asked. We have not yet decided. I have to consult the Prime Minister and others before taking a decision, Sonia replied.

 The Union urban development and parliamentary affairs minister, believed to be reluctant to move to the state, sat on the dais grimly with other cabinet colleagues and the chief ministers.

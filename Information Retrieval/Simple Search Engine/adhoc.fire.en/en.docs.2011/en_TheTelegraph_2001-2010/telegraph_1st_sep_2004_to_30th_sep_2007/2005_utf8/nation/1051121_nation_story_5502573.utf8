 Taliban abduct Indian driver

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: An Indian driver with the Border Roads Organisation and three of his co-workers were kidnapped by suspected Taliban rebels last night from the Nimroz province in southern Afghanistan.

 The driver, M.R. Kutty, and his colleagues, who are Afghans, were involved in the construction of a road linking the southern city of Kandahar with Herat in the west.

 Kutty, who hails from central Kerala, was working on a road building programme called the Zaranj-Delaram project. Their vehicle was ambushed by unidentified gunmen.

 A purported spokesman for the Taliban, who called himself Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, told AFP on phone that his outfit had abducted the four men. 

 A report from Kandahar quoting Nimroz provincial governor Ghulam Dasthaqir confirmed that suspected Taliban rebels had kidnapped an Indian and three Afghans.

 Afghan interior ministry spokesman Yousuf Stanezai also confirmed the abduction but did not know who the captors were.

 Engineers and BRO staff engaged in road building have been targeted by Taliban in the past, too. In December 2003, two Indians were kidnapped while working on a US-funded road project. But they were released, unharmed and unconditionally, after 19 days in captivity following the intervention of top Afghan authorities. 

 The Zaranj-Delaram road project has been vested with some amount of strategic importance. It is part of the link from the Iranian port of Chabahar to the Garland highway that runs around Afghanistan linking the main cities of Mazar-e-Sharief, Herat and Kandahar.

 With the Pakistan government refusing to give transit rights, India is dependent on shipping equipment for a number of projects through the Iranian port.

 External affairs ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said Afghan agencies were investigating the matter. 

 We have seen reports that Taliban had abducted them. If the reports are true, we condemn the incident and urge that all persons should be released immediately, unharmed, he said. So far, the ministry has not got independent confirmation of the Talibans involvement.

 The Indian embassy in Kabul was in touch with the Afghan government and the agencies concerned, which were also exploring all leads to ensure the release of those kidnapped.

 The abduction coincides with a rise in violence, including a series of suicide attacks by Taliban guerrillas this week in Kabul and in the south, a stronghold of the Taliban before they were ousted from power by US-led forces in 2001.

 In September this year, a British engineer was kidnapped. His body was later found in the western province of Farah. The Taliban claimed they had killed him.

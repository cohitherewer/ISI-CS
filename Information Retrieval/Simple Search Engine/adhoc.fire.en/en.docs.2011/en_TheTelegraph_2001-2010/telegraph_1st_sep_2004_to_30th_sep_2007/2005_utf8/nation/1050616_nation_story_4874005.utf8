 Hush-up salvo at Gaur govt

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, June 15: Shakuntala Verma, the crusader against child marriage who had her arms hacked last month, today brought the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh under a cloud by alleging a political cover-up.

 Verma said the person with whom she had an argument while trying to stop child marriages in the village of Bhangarh, Dhar district, was a BJP worker.

 Speaking from her hospital bed in Indore, the women and child welfare department supervisor said the police had pressured her not to mention child marriages in connection with the attack.

 An unidentified assailant had nearly chopped off Vermas hands at her home in Rajgarh on May 10. She said she had been threatened on May 3 at Bhangarh while campaigning against child marriage.

 At first, the government, including chief minister Babulal Gaur, suggested various other motives behind the attack, such as personal enmity ? even a love affair. 

 However, following protests from the victim and her family, the government admitted that Verma was targeted because of her efforts to stop child marriages in Bhangarh.

 Today, Dhar collector D.P. Ahuja denied Vermas latest allegation against police. He suggested she has been making these accusations possibly because she was upset with the Gokuldas hospital authorities, who have reportedly been asking her to leave.

 Verma said she had not recovered fully yet. She cannot move her left hand at all and can move her right hand only slightly.

 State women and child welfare secretary S.R. Mohanty said hospital bills cannot be an issue. 

 The state government is very clear: we will settle the amount, he declared. The hospital should not tell Shakuntala about the amount as we represent her.

 Mohanty said he had no problems admitting that the attack could have been linked to child marriage.

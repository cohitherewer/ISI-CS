 Quake on Sonia plate on birthday

 Srinagar/Jammu, Dec. 9: There were no celebrating faces around her as Sonia Gandhi turned 60 today, but only those that told of grim survival and misery.

 The Congress president spent her birthday sympathising with quake victims in Jammu and Kashmir and listening to their complaints.

 We want our home back, sobbed Sakshi, a 12-year-old girl in Poonch. We shiver in this tent. There is no light. Please give us our home back.

 At Sultan Daki, 17 km from Uri town, 30-year-old Mohammad Kabir told her his family of 10 owned two houses. Both were destroyed and now the authorities are offering me money that wont build even one house.

 Sonia heard the same stories again and again as she threaded her way through the tents sheltering the homeless. Again and again, she promised to do everything for you.

 They should get all that they need, she told chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 Sonia waved away her security personnel when they came between her and the jostling queues. Let them come, she said.

 Only once did the ruling alliance chairperson seem annoyed. That was when she learnt that over 300 families in Uri were yet to be rehabilitated because the land had caved in and there was no place to rebuild their homes or even for makeshift tin-and-timber shelters.

 From Sultan Daki, Sonia went to the nearby Kamalkote village, where, too, every single building had collapsed.

 She would be spending the night at a guesthouse in Gingli village near Uri town. She will visit Tangdhar tomorrow and, later at Srinagar, flag off a bus carrying quake orphans to Pune, where an NGO has adopted them.

 This is Sonias second visit to the state since the quake, the first having come on October 9, the day after the tragedy.

 Other than Azad, she was accompanied by Congress general secretary Ambika Soni.

 SA protest over red-light street name

 - Mahatma Homage Row

 Durban, March 10 (PTI): The decision to rename Point Road of this city after Mahatma Gandhi has sparked a controversy with people of Indian origin complaining that the choice was not appropriate and the South African authorities should have chosen a main street.

 Local leaders and residents bombarded a radio station catering to the Indian community against Gandhi?s name being used to rename the road, which, they said, is infamous for prostitution and drugs. The renaming demonstrated no respect for Gandhi, they added.

 Ashwin Desai, an activist and academic, said: ?I have a problem when Gandhi?s name is used for the Point Road area. Gandhi practised as a lawyer in West Street and if anything, I think the main street should have been named after Gandhi.?

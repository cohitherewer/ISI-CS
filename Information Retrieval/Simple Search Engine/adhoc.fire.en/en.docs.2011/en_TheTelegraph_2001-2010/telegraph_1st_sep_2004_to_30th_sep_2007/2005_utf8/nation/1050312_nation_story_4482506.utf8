 Gutka baron sets April date with CBI

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 11: Gutka king Rasiklal Dhariwal, who is accused of having links with the underworld, today gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court that he would appear before the Central Bureau of Investigation on April 4.

 The CBI, in turn, assured the court that it would not arrest the owner of the Manikchand group.

 Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati, appearing for the CBI, told a division bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and Tarun Chatterjee that a non-bailable warrant pending against Dhariwal would not be executed as the gutka baron has agreed to appear for interrogation.

 Prakash Rasiklal Dhariwal gave the undertaking on his father?s behalf through senior counsel Harish Salve. Dhariwal could not return from abroad immediately to appear before the CBI as it would disturb his NRI status and have financial implications, Salve said.

 Prakash had challenged a Bombay High Court order refusing to stay the warrant issued against his father by Mumbai police, who were investigating the case before the CBI.

 The apex court enquired how Dhariwal, a witness in the case, was served with the warrant and shown as a witness ?till date? in the case. ?Under what provision of the CrPC the warrant was issued?? the bench asked. ?Police have no power to issue warrants against a witness.?

 The solicitor-general said the warrant was issued to bring him to court and claimed that there are several documents to show his involvement.

 Degree cut-off cry to sell drugs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: Pharmacists have asked the government to upgrade the minimum qualifications for registration of pharmacists and ensure that only adequately qualified people sell drugs.

 The Pharmacy Council of India and the Indian Pharmacy Graduates Association have called for an amendment to rules so that the minimum qualification for registration of pharmacists is raised from the existing D.Pharm certificate to a B.Pharm degree.

 The B.Pharm course is a four-year programme, equivalent to a B.Tech or engineering course, after Class XII. But D.Pharm is a two-year programme and, a pharmacist said, not intensive enough to match the increasing complexity of the drug sector.

 The number of drugs is increasing and well-qualified pharmacists can provide truly unbiased information about drugs to patients and physicians, said Dr Bhojraj Suresh, the president of the Pharmacy Council of India.

 The council estimates that about 13,000 students graduate each year with B.Pharm degrees from pharmacy colleges across India. The number of students with D.Pharm certificates is about 20,000 each year.

 The council has sought amendments with prospective effect. So any changes will not affect diploma holders already registered as pharmacists.

 Indian Pharmacy Graduates Association officials have also suggested the creation of a bridge course that would allow diploma-holders to acquire B.Pharm degrees. The idea is to do away with the diploma in a phased manner, said Prem Sharma, the associations president.

 A two-year programme, Sharma said, is too short a period to gain adequate knowledge required for a career in pharmacy. In addition to learning about drugs and formulations, the programme should also be oriented to patient health care, Sharma said.

 The Pharmacy Council of India has also asked state governments to appoint pharmacy inspectors to ensure that retail drugstores adhere to rules on sales of drugs. 

 A drug should only be sold under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist, said Suresh. However, in the absence of pharmacy inspectors, its hard to assess how effectively these are implemented.

 The council has said the proposed amendments would lead to better pharmacy services to consumers. 

 Practising doctors, Suresh said, often take decisions on the prescriptions to their patients on the basis of marketing information that they have received from drug company representatives. Pharmacists make up a source of unbiased information about drugs.

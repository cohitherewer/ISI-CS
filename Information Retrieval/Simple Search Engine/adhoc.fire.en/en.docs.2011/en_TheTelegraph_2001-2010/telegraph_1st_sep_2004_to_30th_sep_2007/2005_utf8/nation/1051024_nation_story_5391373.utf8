 Arrest looms on Ansari 

 Lucknow, Oct. 23 (PTI): The Uttar Pradesh government has launched a hunt for the arrest of Independent MLA Mukhtar Ansari.

 He is named in an FIR for inciting communal riots and murder in Mau town.

 Raids are being carried out in various parts of the state and three raids were conducted in Lucknow itself this morning to arrest Ansari, state principal secretary (home) Alok Sinha and director-general of police Yashpal Singh told a news conference.

 The Mau superintendent of police had asked the police chiefs of Ghazipur and Lucknow to help track down Ansari, they said.

 Singh ruled out the possibility of withdrawing the murder case in light of the person who filed the FIR giving Ansari a clean chit and accusing the local police of framing the MLA.

 The new claims in this regard will, however, be included in the ongoing inquiries, he said.

 The DGP also warned that if the security guards provided to the MLA did not report the whereabouts of Ansari, now a murder accused, action could be taken against them.

 Asked how Ansari, entitled to two security guards as an MLA, has been provided eight guards, Singh said he has already instructed the officials to examine the details and withdraw them in case they had been provided against prescribed norms.

 Rane plans tell-all book

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 4: Narayan Rane has threatened to write a book on why and how he was expelled from the Shiv Sena. 

 After his expulsion on June 24, Rane made a flurry of allegations against Sena patriarch Bal Thackerays son Uddhav and said key party posts were being sold. Uddhavs secretary Milind Narvekar played a role in these alleged deals, he said.

 I was shown the door because I dared to expose this corruption and spoke the truth, the former chief minister has been repeating at well-attended public meetings in areas known as Sena strongholds.

 Now, he promises to expose the inner workings at Matoshree, Thackerays Bandra bungalow, in the book.

 Thackeray on Friday broke his silence on Ranes campaign at a meeting of the partys Konkan division at Shanmukhananda Hall, where he abused the former chief minister in his trademark provocative language replete with obscenities.

 The Sena leader revealed details of Ranes multi-crore assets which, he said, include a chain of restaurants, petrol pumps, bungalows, and properties in Mumbai and Konkan. When he was a Mumbai corporator, he did not even have a house to live in. He owes his wealth to Shiv Sena. I made him the chief minister.

 Urging supporters to stamp out Ranes rebellion in Konkan, Thackeray said despite his failing health, he would lead the party campaign in Sindhudurg district and address rallies after the 10-day Ganesh festival beginning on Wednesday.

 Rane, who has become a revenue minister in the Vilasrao Deshmukh government after crossing over to the Congress, is running a campaign aimed at defeating the Sena in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections scheduled in 2007. 

 He has been canvassing aggressively in Shiv Sena bastions and wooing disgruntled partymen. He has also been trying to wrest powerful Sena trade unions, which control key industrial and business establishments. A fortnight ago, Sena union leader Jaywant Parab switched support to the Congress and brought Khambatta Aviation, a private aviation company, into the Rane fold.

 The Sena suffered another big blow last week when its prominent Thane chief, Satish Pradhan, resigned from the party. Pradhan, who had helped build the party in Thane, said he felt sidelined after Uddhav Thackeray took over the partys reins in 2002.

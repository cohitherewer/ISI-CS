 China point man

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 3: The Centre has decided to appoint national security adviser M.K. Narayanan as its ?special representative? for China.

 The Prime Minister and the foreign minister finalised his name yesterday, sources said. A formal announcement may be made by the weekend.

 It is interesting that Manmohan Singh decided on Narayanan when names of some retired diplomats, especially those who are known China-hands, were doing the rounds.

 The decision shows not only the Prime Minister?s confidence in Narayanan but also K. Natwar Singh?s comfort level with the national security adviser as his name could not have been finalised without the foreign minister?s backing.

 India and China appointed ?special representatives? during then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s Beijing tour in 2003. The aim was to nominate two senior persons who enjoyed their leaderships? confidence to sort out the boundary issue.

 Brajesh Mishra, Vajpayee?s national security adviser, was the first ?special representative?.

 Narayanan?s appointment is significant because Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is scheduled to visit India at the end of this month.

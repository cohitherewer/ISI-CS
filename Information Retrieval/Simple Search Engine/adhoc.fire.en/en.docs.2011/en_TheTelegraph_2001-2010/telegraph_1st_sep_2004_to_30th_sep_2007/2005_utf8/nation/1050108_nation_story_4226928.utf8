 PM to peon, in same boat

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: From the ?Prime Minister to the peon?, all will come under the Lok Pal?s gaze, Union law minister H.R. Bhardwaj announced today. 

 A group of ministers will be set up to suggest ?comprehensive changes in the existing Lok Pal Bill to bring all the three wings of governance ? the legislature, the executive and the judiciary ? within its ambit?, he said. ?The provisions of the bill will be tightened with the formation of the GoM.?

 The decision to bring the judiciary within the ambit of the Lok Pal?s inquiry powers for the first time heralds a radical change. ?The public demand is that all three wings of the state should be brought within the ambit of a watchdog to bring in transparency in their functioning,? the minister said. 

 To be headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, the group will give suggestions to amend the existing Lok Pal bill, Bhardwaj said. It ?will not consult the CJI (Chief Justice of India) and will directly give its suggestions to the government by working independently?.

 The group will consist of ?four to five ministers, including the law minister and science and technology minister Kapil Sibal?, Bhardwaj said.

 It will also recommend the formation of an authority that will grant sanction for prosecution of public servants, MPs and others. This power is now vested with the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

 The minister did not give any time frame for the formation of the group. The bill might not even be moved in the budget session. All he said was the public should ?get a feeling? that there is a body to which it can take its grievances against public servants. 

 The Lok Pal will be an authority similar to the Lokayuktas functioning in states and the group will look to fasten the ?accountability? clause on everyone. 

 Bhardwaj said the group would answer the Supreme Court poser in the JMM case judgment. The court had held that MPs and MLAs are public servants and the government should enact a law for according sanction to prosecute them in corruption cases.

 If put to practice, the new Lok Pal Bill might take away the ?immunity? provided to MPs under Article 105 of the Constitution for their commissions and omissions and manner of voting inside Parliament. ?It is no longer possible to take shelter under the privileges and immunities. There should be a model law to deal with corruption in all wings of democracy, including the judiciary,? Bhardwaj said.

 ?We will examine whether the existing impeachment mechanism is enough to deal with corruption in judiciary or any other mechanism like withdrawal of the docket from a judge under cloud of corruption would be needed to be put in place.?

 Navy war room leak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: An air force officer and three naval officers can face charges of breach of confidentiality after information was leaked from the navys war room and sold to a supplier of military equipment, a report submitted to the defence minister has said.

 A board of inquiry instituted by the navy and a subsequent check by naval headquarters has found that some individuals had parted with information of commercial value primarily pertaining to qualitative requirements of equipment being procured by the navy, an official statement issued by the ministry today said.

 The statement did not identify the officers. It is understood that a wing commander of the air force, cross-posted in the Directorate of Naval Operations (DNO), a captain and a commander of the navy, also with the DNO, and another commander with the department of ocean management in naval headquarters can face charges of breaching secrecy rules. 

 If the ministry and service headquarters find that there is enough evidence, the officers can be court-martialled. However, it is unlikely that a charge of treason will be considered because the board of inquiry has not found evidence that the officers were spying for a potential adversary.

 The official statement said naval headquarters forwarded the boards report to the ministry yesterday.

 Considering the seriousness of this breach, a detailed report, along with action recommended against those culpable, has been forwarded by naval headquarters to the competent authority to initiate necessary disciplinary action under the Navy Act 1957, it said.

 Naval headquarters has also started a drive to implement remedial measures both in terms of physical security and organisational checks and balances (which) are being expeditiously instituted to prevent recurrence.

 The board of inquiry was headed by Rear Admiral Ganesh Mahadevan, the assistant chief of naval operations (information technology).

 Delhi blips on Rice radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 3: US secretary of state Condoleeza Rice is likely to come to India on an official visit later this month ? her first trip to the subcontinent.

 Though dates are yet to be finalised, indications suggest Rice may be here on March 16. It is also likely that she will also go to Pakistan as in the past years this has been the usual travel programme of senior US leaders who have visited South Asia.

 US embassy officials maintained that they were not aware of a visit by Rice to India or in the neighbourhood. But highly placed sources in the government said Rice is seriously considering visiting India and the visit is likely to take place by the middle of this month.

 Her visit to Delhi ? if it takes place ? will be another indicator of the importance the US gives to its bilateral relations with India and Pakistan. In the recent past, a visit by the US secretary of state to the subcontinent has been mainly at the height of tensions between India and Pakistan.

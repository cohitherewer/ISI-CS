 More clashes with Maoists

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, June 26: One policeman was killed in a fierce encounter with suspected Maoists at Piprahi in Sitamarhi, even as security forces were engaged in an exchange of fire with rebels at Bargainia in the district on the Indo-Nepal border.

 Nearly half-a-dozen police personnel were injured in the operation near Jamua Mairwa village in Piprahi led by superintendent of police Kundan Krishnan. 

 One villager has also reportedly died, along with constable Bhupendra Singh, in the exchange of fire.

 A special task force source said the Naxalites involved in the encounters could be those who had recently struck at Madhuban in the adjoining East Champaran district and could also include Nepalese Maoists.

 The meticulous planning for the Madhuban attack has shown the influence that the extremists have established in the region. The coordination with the Nepalese Maoists has only given them additional teeth, the source said.

 The chain of events leading from Madhuban to Bargainia has provided sufficient clues of active involvement of the Nepalese Maoists in Bihar ? for the first time on such a large scale ? though they have suffered heavy reverses in the Himalayan kingdom, said the source. 

 Maps of possible targets and deployment of extremists have also been recovered from the spot in Madhuban.

 The startling fact is the presence of some Nepalese names among the list of those to be deployed. The porous land border has only complicated our task, the source said.

 The STF source said the fresh incidents were indications of action at the lowest level by the CPI(Maoist).

 The attacks in the bordering districts and the stepping up of extremist activities in central Bihar have again underlined the attempts by the Naxalites to create a Red corridor from Nepal to the south of Jharkhand and beyond, said the source.

 Soldiers injured in chopper 

 crash 

 Jammu (PTI): At least 12 

 army and two air force personnel were injured, five of them 

 seriously, when an MI-17 air force helicopter crashed in 

 Poonch district on Tuesday morning.

 The chopper, with 19 personnel on board, was on an operational maintenance sortie when it crashed while landing at Derawali Gali helipad. It lost balance after hitting a tree and caught fire, Colonel D.K. Badola of the 16 Corps said. 

 The pilots sounded warning bells telling the personnel to jump out. The defence personnel were injured while jumping but the pilots escaped unhurt. The chopper rolled 200 feet downhill. 

 An official release in Delhi, however, said eight personnel and one crew member were injured. No serious injuries had been reported. 

 Top air force sources have ruled out sabotage and said an inquiry has been ordered into the crash.

 19 killed in Himachal mishap

 Dharamshala (PTI): At least 19 

 people were killed when a private bus fell into a gorge

 The driver possibly had lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve, police said. Several bodies were crushed beyond recognition as the bus tumbled down the gorge. Four of the 20 people, who were injured, are in a critical condition.

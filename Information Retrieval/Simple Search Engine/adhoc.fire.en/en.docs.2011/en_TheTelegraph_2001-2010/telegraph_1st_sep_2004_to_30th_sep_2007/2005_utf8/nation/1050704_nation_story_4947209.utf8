 Pak rules on visas for Indians

 Islamabad, July 3 (PTI): Pakistan has announced that visa requests from India must reach its relevant authorities eight weeks in advance with photocopies of a valid passport.

 The guidelines were announced by Pakistans interior ministry, keeping in mind the trouble individuals or groups intent on visiting Pakistan face, an official release said. The demand for Pakistani visas has swelled after a recent thaw in bilateral ties with India.

 The visa request has to be made on a form that can be obtained from the section officer (India) in the interior division of the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi. The form can also be downloaded from the ministry of interiors website www.Interior.Gov.Pk.

 For cultural and sports functions, the ministry of culture, sports and youth affairs must be contacted. Such visa requests will be processed only after they are received through the concerned ministry.

 The guidelines have been set as the authorities failed to process the applications as visa-seekers often did not follow the procedure laid down, the release said.

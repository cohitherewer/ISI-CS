 Delhi not bothered by Pak-Israel bonhomie

 PRANAY SHARMA

 Islamabad, Sept. 3: India is not worried about the first high-level contact between Pakistan and Israel, though many feel it will lead to the establishment of full-fledged diplomatic relations between the two countries.

 Indian diplomats have indicated that the development reflects Islamabads acceptance of a ground reality that Delhi had acknowledged more than a decade ago.

 Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri met his Israel counterpart Silvan Shalom in Istanbul on Thursday, marking a departure from the policy that Islamabad has pursued for more than 57 years.

 Several Arab and Islamic countries have diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv, but Islamabad has so far avoided making any such conciliatory gesture. However, Pakistan has rung in a change by asking for a meeting with Israel on September 1.

 Some people have suggested that Pakistans decision stemmed from its desire to negate the growing ties between India and Israel and to ensure it was not adversely affected.

 It was felt that India would be concerned over the development. There were reports in some sections of the media that India has already registered its protest with Israel. However, Indian officials have denied the reports and said Delhi is confident of its relations with Tel Aviv.

 There is a feeling that Indias response is an attempt to put up a brave face. But Delhis confidence seems to stem from the way bilateral relations have strengthened since full-fledged diplomatic relations were established with Israel in 1992.

 The ties were strengthened mainly under the BJP-led NDA. This led to several high-level visits between the two countries, including one by Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to Delhi two years ago. It has also helped the two sides strengthen cooperation in several sectors.

 The two-way trade has crossed $4 billion and the graph shows an upward trend. For a country of Israels size, this is a significant volume.

 The two sides have also built close ties in defence and other security-related matters. Tel Aviv has supplied the sensors Delhi has put along the Line of Control to detect infiltrators and there are indications that the Israelis are willing to help India in several other areas.

 The relationship has not been restricted to the leaderships in Delhi and Tel Aviv. Several Indian chief ministers, including Jyoti Basu, have visited Israel.

 That India is perhaps the only country in the world that has never persecuted Jews is also something that the Israelis will not forget in a hurry. The popularity of India is such that it has now become one of the favourite tourist destinations for Israelis, especially the younger generation.

 Successive Israeli leaders have had no qualms in admitting that India is now one of its closest allies in Asia and perhaps the world.

 uch of what President Pervez Musharraf is doing may have been prompted by the US and his eagerness to develop a link with the strong Jewish-American lobby.

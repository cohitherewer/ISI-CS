 Muzaffarabad, Oct. 15 (Reuters): Zarina Bibi has lost all her three children to last weeks killer earthquake, her husband is badly injured, but she will not be moved from a lonely vigil in front of Muzaffarabads Womens Degree College.

 The body of her eldest daughter, Zainab Abdullah, lies in the ruins of the college hostel and Bibi is determined to give her a proper Islamic burial.

 Until then, Bibi intends staying in a tent in front of the hostel in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan Kashmir, where Zainabs body lies with those of at least seven other young women.

 Our life is ruined, but I want to give a burial to her, it will give some peace to my heart, Bibi sobbed, after recounting how she had already buried Zainabs two younger sisters at the family home at Haddian Bala, 40 km from Muzaffarabad.

 Leaving Zainab unburied would be a sin, she said.

 We were proud of her as she was the only girl who reached college in our family, Bibi said. But she does not have life to complete her education.

 At least 38,000 people died in Pakistan in the 7.6-magnitude earthquake, according to official estimates released a week after it struck.

 Northern Pakistan and Pakistan Kashmir bore the brunt and Muzaffarabad is devastated.

 About 1,500 people died in the Indian part of Kashmir.

 Bibi said an army helicopter took her and her husband from their home to a sprawling tented camp and clinic at Muzaffarabad university two days after the earthquake. 

 Her husband was treated for broken ribs and an injured left shoulder.

 Trying to cover her head from heavy rain with a thin woollen blanket, she described how she saw body after body being brought out of the rubble of the university hostel and rescuers said there was no hope that anyone could have survived.

 I will find her body one day. I have all the faith in God, Bibi said, pointing towards the mound of broken concrete and masonry cordoned off by a Turkish search and rescue team.

 Many of the quakes victims were students, as schools and colleges were full when the tremor struck just before 9 am.

 There were an estimated 62,000 injured and many other parents have become separated from children who have been evacuated to Islamabad and other cities for treatment.

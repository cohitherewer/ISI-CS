 Divorce rap

 New Delhi, June 21 (PTI): Delhi High Court has ruled that a husband cannot withdraw his assent to consensual divorce unless he shows that force, fraud or undue influence made him agree.

 Justice Mukul Mudgals ruling came after a woman appealed against a lower court order that had allowed her husbands application to withdraw his consent after a divorce settlement.

 As part of the agreement, the woman had withdrawn dowry harassment charges against her husband Neeraj Jain and claims for maintenance for her and her minor daughter. 

 Jain, who is now absconding, is reported to have remarried and has a child from the second marriage, which the high court has held bigamous.

 Setting aside the verdict of the additional district judge, Justice Mudgal said it is evident that the withdrawal of consent by the husband is mala fide, baseless and unjust. Thus, it is a fit case where a decree of divorce by way of mutual consent should have been granted.

 Mudgal said the court cannot be a hapless spectator to the duplicity of the husband who induced his wife to not only forgo maintenance claims but also duped her into agreeing to the withdrawal of the criminal complaints.

 MPs join eye-for-eye battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: After failing to save Maniappan Raman Kutty from the Taliban in Afghanistan, the countrys lawmakers do not want to take chances in Abdul Latif Naushads case.

 A court in Saudi Arabia has ordered that one of Naushads eyes be gouged out and handed to a Saudi he had blinded in a scuffle three years ago over a battery charger. 

 Reacting to the case today, MPs cutting across party lines demanded that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh speak to the Saudi king to reverse the judgment. The MPs want to use the good relations between the countries to ask the king to intervene in the case.

 Naushad has appealed in a higher court in Riyadh against the judgment.

 Minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed today informed the Upper House that the Indian mission in Saudi Arabia was in touch with the local authorities to save the Indian.

 Naushad, who hails from Kerala and worked at a petrol station in Dammam, had an altercation with the Saudi over the purchase of a battery charger. The Saudi wanted to return the charger that he said was defective and allegedly roughed up Naushad. His left eye was damaged when Naushad acted in self-defence. 

 Ahmed said a mercy petition has already been moved before the governors of Dammam and Riyadh and the Prime Ministers Office will be informed of the sentiment in the House. The government said only the Saudi king can reverse the order. 

 In Naushads home state of Kerala, chief minister Oommen Chandy today said he would personally take up the case with the Prime Minister. Addressing reporters after a cabinet meeting today, Chandy said he had already written to Singh in this regard and would talk to him as soon as he returns from Russia.

 We will request for humanitarian treatment of the prisoner, though the government has limitations in taking up such matters with another country, he said.

 Chandy added that the crime allegedly committed by Naushad was not intentional or planned. It was incidental and, so, special treatment was needed in the case.

 Naushads case is not the only one where an Indian has been imprisoned abroad. Recently, Sijo Jose, also hailing from Kerala, was captured by the US Army in Iraq. He was released after the Indian government intervened. 

 Chandy said Sijo would arrive in Kochi today.

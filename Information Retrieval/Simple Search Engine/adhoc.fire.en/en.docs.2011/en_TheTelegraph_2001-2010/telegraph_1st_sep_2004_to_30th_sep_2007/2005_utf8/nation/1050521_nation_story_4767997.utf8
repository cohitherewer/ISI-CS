 Pandya murder plays itself out again, almost

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, May 20: In a near rerun of the murderous assault on Haren Pandya two years ago, another rebel Gujarat BJP leader was shot at today from a motorcycle but emerged unhurt.

 Bhavin Seth, 37, Pandyas successor as MLA from Ahmedabads Ellisbridge, was on his morning walk in the resort town of Saputara near the Maharashtra border when he came under attack.

 Pandya, like Seth a staunch adversary of Narendra Modi, was gunned down on 26 March, 2003, by motorbike-borne assailants in Ahmedabad as he prepared to return home after his morning walk.

 Seth said he had just stepped out of the circuit house around 7 am when one of two men on a motorcycle fired at him. The MLA didnt have his bodyguard with him ? a circumstance into which the director-general of police, A.K. Bhargav, has ordered an inquiry.

 Dang superintendent of police Chandrashekhar, however, said the guard had gone to Shirdi, the pilgrim centre in Maharashtra, with Seths brother-in-law.

 Chandrashekhar even cast doubt on Seths claim of an attempt on his life, citing how the police had failed to find any empty cartridge at the site and how no one seemed to have heard the gunshot. He, however, conceded that the attackers might have fired from sophisticated weapons fitted with silencers.

 But in Gandhinagar, home secretary Shivanand Jha, who hurriedly called a news conference at the instance of the chief minister, said that immediately after the attack, a head constable who was on duty nearby had informed his bosses about it.

 Seth, who is in the construction business, told reporters in Surat he wasnt sure about the motive behind the attack. It could have been plotted as much by his business rivals as his political opponents.

 The MLA believes the gunmen did not intend to kill him. If they had wanted, they could have easily killed me, he said. Maybe my opponents wanted to just frighten me.

 But he confirmed receiving threat calls during the past one year.

 His younger brother, Parag Seth, said these calls came about six months ago, when dissident activity was at its peak in the state BJP and the rebels were calling for Modis head. The calls were traced to a local PCO. 

 Following this, an FIR was lodged and the MLA was given a security guard.

 The home secretary said an FIR was lodged after todays attack and a forensic science laboratory team sent to Saputara.

 Dhaka pat for Atal 

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: Dhaka has begun seeing virtues in the Vajpayee-led NDA government, saying the former Prime Minister would not have called off the Saarc summit on security considerations, reports our special correspondent.

 Bangladesh has been unhappy with the present Congress-led UPA regime since the summit was postponed earlier this month after Delhi said the security situation in Bangladesh was a cause for concern and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would not travel to Dhaka. 

 ?Because the Congress party was in power in 1971 and India played a part in the liberation of Bangladesh, the Congress believes we have to be eternally grateful for its help and bow our heads in obeisance and second-guess what New Delhi wants,? a diplomat, who did not wish to be named, said. 

 The diplomat said he believed that the NDA would have looked at the situation differently. Vajpayee went for the Islamabad summit despite an attack on President Pervez Musharraf?s convoy in Rawalpindi before the meet, he pointed out.

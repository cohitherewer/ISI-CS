 New Delhi, Dec. 5: The Opposition today accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of undermining the importance of Parliament by leaving on a foreign trip in the middle of the winter session.

 BJP leader Sushma Swaraj, speaking in the Rajya Sabha, also objected to the Prime Ministers reference to the Volcker report in Moscow.

 Both Houses of Parliament met briefly today as the Opposition stalled proceedings for the second day running on the Iraqi oil-for-food scam, demanding resignations of Natwar Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

 According to an understanding reached between the Opposition and the ruling party to end the deadlock in Parliament, Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat allowed Sushma to speak for three minutes. The BJP leader seized the opportunity to criticise the Prime Minister for not taking the House into confidence before leaving for Russia.

 The Rajya Sabha secretariat later said the Prime Minister had followed convention and there have been precedents when heads of government have travelled abroad while Parliament was in session.

 Important international events like summits and conferences, where the Prime Ministers attendance is mandatory, are not given a go-by during Parliament sessions, officials said. 

 In the absence of the Prime Minister, ministers are designated to perform various duties, including answering questions in Parliament. Since Singh is handling a number of portfolios, various ministers have been designated to stand in for him.

 However, the storm over the Volcker report is unlikely to subside till Singh returns from Russia. The governments plan to convene an all-party meeting to end the crisis has also hit a roadblock, with the Opposition demanding that it be held in the presence of the Prime Minister.

 The NDA leaders have also not given any assurance that they will let Parliament function tomorrow.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said today the government was ready to take any step to end the deadlock. He said another discussion could be held on the Volcker controversy and also agreed to discuss the impact of foreign funding on Indian politics ? an issue the BJP has raised in the House. 

 Das Munshi said the issue of foreign funding could be taken up instead of a discussion on the Mitrokhin archives, as demanded by the BJP.

 Naidu works NTR magic to win support

 Hyderabad, May 28: Down and out Chandrababu Naidu has invoked the magic of NTR to get up and going.

 Opening the annual Telugu Desam convention on N.T. Rama Raos birthday, Naidu today announced an NTR memorial school would be set up for children of killed workers.

 With huge pictures of NTR looking down from hoardings and buntings and songs and skits from his films playing, the Desam chief said the party would leave no stone unturned to support children of loyalists killed in political violence.

 We will try to make up for the loss of their parents at least by giving them good education and arming them to become good leaders in the future, he said in his opening address at the TDP Mahanadu, 2005.

 This is the first time since Naidu snatched the Desam reins from NTR in 1995 that the dates of the convention have been shifted from March 28, the day the party was founded in 1982.

 It is also the first time that an out-of-power Naidu ? he was toppled last May ? is unashamedly exploiting NTRs popularity to win some goodwill and support for himself.

 Naidu said the proposed school would be unique in that it would groom children ? from classes VI to X to begin with ? in party philosophy alongside regular lessons. It would start taking in students from this academic year.

 The admissions will be given to children of party workers on the basis of merit, he told the 400-odd delegates at the meet. Earlier, he condoled the deaths of about 125 partymen in mass sit-ins and Naxalite strikes.

 Since the Congresss landslide win in Andhra last year, Naidu has been through a rough patch. In announcing the model school, he has taken a leaf out of NTRs book, who had set up the National Institute of Political Consciousness to groom political leaders.

 Once the students graduated from the institute, they were appointed as political associates to MPs and ministers. But after Naidu came to power, he summarily sacked them saying they were NTRs agents.

 Naidu today did not miss the opportunity to train guns on the Congress at the Centre and in the state. Quoting the Jharkhand, Goa and Bihar fiascos, he urged workers to note how governors were being misused by the UPA.

 The different rules invoked in Goa, Jharkhand and Bihar show how the institution of governor was misused by the UPA. The Desam strongly opposes the appointment of defeated chief ministers and retired Congressmen as governors, he said.

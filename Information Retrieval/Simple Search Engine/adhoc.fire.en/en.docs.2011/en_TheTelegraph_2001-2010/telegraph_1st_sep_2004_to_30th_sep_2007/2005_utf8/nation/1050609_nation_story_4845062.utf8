 Seers second coming, same spot as 51 years ago

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Kancheepuram, June 8: The wheel turned full circle for acharya Jayendra Saraswati today as he marked his formal return to the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt from the exact spot where he had been initiated into sanyas 51 years ago.

 The pontiff, junior seer Vijayendra Saraswati in tow, arrived at the Sarvatheertham tank at the north-western end of the temple town early in the morning to a low-key but spirited welcome from scores of devotees.

 Later, both acharyas re-ascended the mutts ancient pontifical seat, believed to have been founded by Adi Sankara himself, the propounder of the Advaita-Vedanta system of philosophy.

 The seers arrived at Sarvatheertham at the stroke of six today, eight months after they had left Kancheepuram and seven months after Jayendra was arrested at Mehboobnagar in Andhra Pradesh as prime accused in the murder of temple official Shankar Raman.

 The senior pontiff had been staying at Kalavai, about 45 km from here, since his release on bail by the Supreme Court on January 10. Vijayendra, another accused in the case, had joined him recently after Madras High Court relaxed his bail conditions.

 On January 21, police filed a 1,873-page chargesheet in the case, which is being tried at the Chengalpattu sessions court. Jayendras plea in the apex court, seeking transfer of the case outside Tamil Nadu, is pending.

 Today being an auspicious day, the second day after amavasya (new moon) which fell on June 6, the acharyas chose to return to the mutt with its presiding deity, Sri Chandramouleeshwara, mutt sources said.

 The Sarvatheertham tank (which is believed to contain waters of all the sacred Indian rivers) was chosen for the reception for it was there that Jayendra was initiated into sanyas by the late Maha Swami, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, in 1954, the sources said.

 The acharyas got off their vehicle amid full-throated cries of jaya jaya Sankara, hara hara Sankara and were accorded the traditional Poornakumbha welcome by Devalla Janakiraman, a Teertha purohit.

 Then, under a small shamiana put up near the Sandhavalli Amman temple, Rama Koti Shastrigal of the mutt ? one of its seniormost priests ? tied the parivattam (a dark-red turban) around Jayendras head and welcomed him with a garland and a shawl. He did the same for Vijayendra.

 Although Jayendra had visited the mutt a couple of times after his release from the Vellore jail, it was the turban ceremony that symbolised the return of the acharyas as pontiffs. They received another Poornakumbha welcome at the entrance of the mutt.

 With a wan smile on his face, Jayendra kept his right hand raised in a gesture of blessing as he walked among the devotees but refused the extra garlands.

 In a sudden burst of energy, he walked into the Adi Sankara puja mandap, which had become dusty since his arrest. Both seers paid homage to the large stone statue of Adi Sankara and the first lamp was lit.

 As the acharyas prepared to settle into their daily routines, a truck offloaded a huge cargo of religious paraphernalia, including large vessels and utensils, indicating that the seers would stay in Kancheepuram for now.

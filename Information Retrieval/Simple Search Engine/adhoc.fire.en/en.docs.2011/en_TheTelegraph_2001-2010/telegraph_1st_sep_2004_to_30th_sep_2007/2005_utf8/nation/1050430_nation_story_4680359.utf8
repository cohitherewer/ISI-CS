 Veto-stung Delhi scoffs at Kofi

 - ?Only General Assembly can decide?

 PRANAY SHARMA

 Singh: Fuming

 New Delhi, April 29: Miffed at Kofi Annan?s announcement that additional members to the UN Security Council would not have veto powers, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh today said the matter would be decided by the General Assembly and not the secretary-general.

 A special session of the General Assembly in New York this September will discuss restructuring and reforms in the UN, including the expansion of the Security Council ? the highest decision-making body on international affairs.

 The foreign minister made it clear that India would continue to insist that the new members in the Security Council should also get veto powers like the five permanent members. 

 Popularly known as the P-5, these countries ? the US, the UK, France, Russia and China ? are also the only recognised nuclear powers.

 Singh said India would urge the five countries not to demand the creation of two systems for permanent members. He added that Indian envoys are being sent to 191 countries to convince them against accepting any proposal that is discriminatory.

 ?There is a view that veto should be abolished. Another view is that no one country should have veto and there should be at least three countries (with such privilege) and there is also a view that there should be no discrimination between the current and the new members,? Singh said.

 Annan had said yesterday that enlargement of the council without veto was the only pragmatic option as the P-5 were completely opposed to sharing the power with additional members. 

 But Singh dismissed the argument, saying the option was not acceptable to India. He said Delhi would negotiate with the permanent members not to block the veto-power provision for the new members of the Security Council.

 India has a good chance of making it to the UN high table as it has been trying for a long time and many countries feel it is a rightful contender for a seat.

 The foreign minister might have been voicing his own view or that of a section in the Indian establishment.

 The are some in South Block who are in favour of getting into the Security Council without the veto powers, at least for the time being. They believe that if India is too insistent, it might be overlooked in favour of other countries with a more flexible stand. 

 However, what Singh said today has been Delhi?s stated position, which was articulated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Parliament some time ago.

 Two more die in Mau

 Mau/Lucknow, Oct. 16 (PTI): Fresh violence erupted in trouble-torn Mau town today with two communities trading gunfire.

 Two persons were killed in the incident, taking the death toll in the communal violence that broke out on Thursday night to seven.

 A red alert has been sounded in eastern Uttar Pradesh to prevent any communal backlash in other parts of the state, officials said.

 Senior BJP leaders Kalyan Singh, Kesri Nath Tripathi and Lalji Tandon and party MP Yogi Adityananth were detained at Shahganj and Gorakhpur while they were heading towards Mau, principal secretary (home) Alok Sinha said in Lucknow.

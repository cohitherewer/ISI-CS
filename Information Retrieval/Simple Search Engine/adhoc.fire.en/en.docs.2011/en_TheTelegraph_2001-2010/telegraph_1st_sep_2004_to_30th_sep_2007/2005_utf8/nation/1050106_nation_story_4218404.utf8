 Buddha takes on DVC power

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Durgapur, Jan. 5: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is planning to draw up a power supply package for entrepreneurs willing to set up industries here and adjoining areas in Burdwan district where it faces stiff competition from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC). 

 Officials pointed out that in Durgapur, investors are attracted by the DVC?s tariff ? Rs 3 per unit ? as it is lower than the rate (Rs 5 per unit) offered by the state electricity board. Also, the SEB cannot fix its own tariff according to its requirement as only the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) can fix the same. 

 West Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee today said discussions are on with the commerce and industries department on how to tide over this ?uneven? competition. 

 ?Our officers have taken up the matter with their counterparts in the industries department. We need to offer an attractive incentive package to industrialists who are interested in setting up units in the Durgapur industrial belt. We have discussed the possibility of charging lower rates than what is fixed by SERC with the industries department paying us the difference,? he said.

 State commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said he plans to supply power to bulk consumers (industries) at a cheaper rate. ?We have also discussed whether we can pay to SEB the difference in tariff that has been fixed by the SERC. Unless we do something immediately, some of the interested entrepreneurs may go and apply for power connection from the DVC,? he said. The SEB has also submitted a petition to SERC requesting it to bring down the tariff for bulk consumers. 

 DVC officials said the state power board was facing this problem because the former?s tariff for bulk consumers has not changed since 2000. Being a central power utility with operations in both Bengal and Jharkhand, it is yet to be ascertained which electricity regulatory commission will control the DVC. 

 ?We don?t yet know which regulatory commission will control us and fix our tariff ? the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission or the SERCs of Bengal or Jharkhand. There have been a number of appeals in courts as well as the respective regulatory commissions in this regard. Once this matter is settled, the tariff for industries in Durgapur may not as cheap as it is now,? a DVC official said.

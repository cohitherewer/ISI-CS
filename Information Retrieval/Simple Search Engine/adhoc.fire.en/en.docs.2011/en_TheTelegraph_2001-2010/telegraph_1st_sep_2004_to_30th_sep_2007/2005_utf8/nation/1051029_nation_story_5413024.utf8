 Leak purge in navy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: The navy today sacked three officers on charges of selling classified information from its headquarters.

 Naval headquarters decided to summarily dismiss the officers from service and not press a court martial because of the sensitivity of the office ? Directorate of Naval Operations (DNO) that includes the navy war room ? in which they were posted and from where the information was leaked.

 One of the officers, Captain Kashyap Kumar, was the director of naval operations, the No. 2 in the office headed by the principal director. The other officers were commanders Vinod Kumar Jha and Vijendra Rana.

 Information of commercial value was sold to unauthorised persons, probably a company or its representatives, to influence a bid to sell fast patrol craft and diving suits to the navy.

 The officers have the right to appeal against the dismissal orders in a high court.

 Navy headquarters announced that the action was being taken because a board of inquiry had concluded that the officers had violated the Navy Act, the Official Secrets Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act.

 It is rare for an armed force to be as transparent as the navy has been in this case about action taken against officers. But the sensitivity of the office the officers were appointed in and the need for naval headquarters to clarify that the intelligence that was leaked was not on operational or war plans demanded clarification.

 An examination of the various acts of omission and commission by the above mentioned officers revealed that while discharging their assigned duties in naval headquarters, they have collectively as well as individually compromised the security of classified naval information and thereby jeopardised the interests of the state, said an official statement issued by naval headquarters this evening. They also accepted gratification other than legitimate remuneration, a euphemism for bribes, the statement said.

 The board of inquiry concluded that the three officers were guilty on three counts of copying, obtaining, retaining and disclosing classified information.

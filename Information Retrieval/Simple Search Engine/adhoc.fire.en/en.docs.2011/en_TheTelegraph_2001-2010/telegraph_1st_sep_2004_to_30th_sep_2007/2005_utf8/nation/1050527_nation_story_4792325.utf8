 Tsunami-hit wait for Clinton balm

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Whats in store?

 Nagapattinam, May 26: For a while tomorrow, some cheer may break through the gloom of 13,500 families here, huddled in temporary shelters since the tsunami struck on December 26.

 Bill Clinton will be here on Friday afternoon, interacting with tsunami victims at a relief camp, listening to their problems and working out ways to solve them.

 High expectations surround the four-hour visit of the former US President ? arriving as the UNs special envoy on tsunami relief and rehabilitation ? whose Clinton Foundation has joined several NGOs and UN agencies for rehabilitation work here.

 Despite a sudden turn in the weather ? strong, dusty winds lashed this town late this evening under an overcast sky ? the district authorities are hoping there will be no rain when Clinton touches down in a helicopter.

 The visitor will first be briefed at the district collectorate on the extent of the tragedy and the type and scale of work the various UN agencies have been doing in the district.

 After this, he will spend two hours at a relief camp in the ITI complex near the collectorate, talking to members of the 600 families sheltered there. Clinton, whose foundation has been working in nearby villages on water and sanitation projects, will take a look at how adequate the children-friendly toilets at that camp are.

 Clinton is expected to release a booklet carrying detailed tsunami-related data for Nagapattinam. It will have all the government orders on tsunami relief and rehabilitation, and can serve as a ready handbook for NGOs looking to work here.

 Other than the Clinton Foundation, several UN agencies and NGOs are involved in relief and rehabilitation here, district collector J. Radhakrishnan said.

 For instance, right from the day after the tsunami, Unicef has helped with the supply of drinking water to victims and the setting up of 67 new Anganwadis for the affected children. The World Health Organisation has been working with the state social welfare department in counselling the victims in temporary camps. 

 The United Nations Development Programme has been collaborating with the administration to set up an NGO Coordination Research Centre.

 Clinton will leave for Chennai in the evening by helicopter en route to Sri Lanka. A team of US embassy officials arrived here today to co-ordinate the security arrangements with the state police.

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 5: One-and-a-half-year old Arpit Diwan, who was kidnapped by his maid from Srinivaspuri in Delhi on Monday, was rescued this morning from Orissa?s Sundargarh district. 

 At 8.30 am, the maid, Savitri Minz, was spotted near the Rajgangpur bus stand carrying Arpit in her arms. A group of policemen noticed her behaving suspiciously. When they confronted her, Savitri, a tribal, gave them a false name and tried to hide the child under her shawl.

 ?She seemed restless while enquiring about the next bus,? Sundargarh superintendent of police Y.K. Jethwa told The Telegraph. ?When we saw the baby, we immediately knew that he didn?t look like a tribal child. So we matched the face with Arpit?s photographs. When we questioned her further, she confessed that she had run away from Srinivaspuri.? 

 ?The child is safe and we are in touch with Delhi police to carry out the formalities,? he said.

 Savitri, who was arrested and later taken to a local court, confessed to the crime. The 23-year-old maid said she had slipped out of the Diwan house with Arpit while his parents were away.

 Sundargarh police, acting on a tip-off that Savitri was in the district, had raided her village, Gyanapali, in the Rajgangpur area.

 As Delhi police launched a massive manhunt, the maid hid at the New Delhi railway station till Thursday. Then ?she boarded the Neelachal Express from Delhi and reached Bhubaneswar yesterday. From there, she took a bus to Balasore and then to Rourkela?, Jethwa said.

 Sundargarh police interrogated the weeping domestic help for over an hour. SP Jethwa said ?it appears she kidnapped the child in a fit of rage. She told us that she was frustrated with the Diwans and wanted to go home?. 

 During interrogation, her words were incoherent and she ?fumbled for explanations?. The police are also looking into the possibility of a gang?s involvement in the abduction. 

 Savitri was produced before a first class judicial magistrate in Rajgangpur, who remanded her in 24-hour transit custody of Delhi police. 

 A Delhi sub-inspector took her to Rourkela and from there to Calcutta by train. In the evening, she was flown to Delhi. 

 For mother Bharti, the recovery of her son came as an early birthday gift. ?I am so happy that my son has been rescued. Tomorrow is my birthday and I will be celebrating it with my child.?

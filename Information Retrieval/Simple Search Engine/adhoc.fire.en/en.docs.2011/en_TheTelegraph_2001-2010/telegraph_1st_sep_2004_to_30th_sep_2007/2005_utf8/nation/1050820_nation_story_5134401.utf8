 Dhaka clueless about motive

 FARID HOSSAIN

 Dhaka, Aug. 19: Three days after a wave of bomb blasts killed two people and injured hundreds across Bangladesh, intelligence agencies were still clueless about the motive of the terror attacks.

 However, leading English-language newspaper the Daily Star reported that investigators were almost certain that the blasts were the work of Islamic militants campaigning for the establishment of harsh Islamic rule in this Muslim-majority country.

 They report said suspicion fell on the Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh, a banned Islamic militant group and its powerful foreign ally. 

 The report did not specify foreign ally ? such a phrase usually refers to Pakistan and its intelligence agency, the ISI.

 Meanwhile, the police arrested more than 135 suspects and hunted for more people suspected to be involved in the bombings that has raised concerns about growing Islamic extremism in this impoverished and densely-populated nation of 140 million people, where many poor families send their children to madarsas.

 Little is known about the Jamaat-ul Mujahideen that has come to light in the last five years. Police officials said their suspicion on the banned group became stronger after two of the detainees reportedly admitted to be the members of the group. 

 The two suspects ? Nasir Uddin Dafadar and Moniruzzman ? were arrested yesterday in southwestern Satkhira district and they were brought to Dhaka today for further questioning. They reportedly confessed that they carried out the attacks in Satkhira.

 Superintendent of police at Satkhira Abdur Rahim told reporters that the Jamat-ul Mujahideen was behind the near-simultaneous bomb attacks to try to free their leader Galib, who was arrested early this year following a series of bomb attacks on development workers. 

 The two men were held within three hours of the blasts. 

 Thousands of Opposition activists rallied in Dhaka today to condemn the governments failure in preventing the blasts and netting the perpetrators. 

 The main Opposition party, the Awami League, and its 14 allies took out a huge procession in central Dhaka. 

 The Opposition parties have called for a nationwide dawn-to-dusk hartal or general strike tomorrow, accusing the government of failure to protect Bangladeshs citizens. 

 Prime Minister Khaleda Zia was to return home early tomorrow, cutting short her five-day visit to China. 

 The serial blasts occurred on Wednesday just after Khaleda left for China. She was scheduled to return home on August 21.

 Khaledas main rival, Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, has called for an international probe into the blasts. Our intelligence agencies and police have failed to perform their duties. We need an international probe into the blasts, she said.

 Foreign diplomats and nationals have curtailed their movements in Bangladesh. Canada has asked its nationals to leave the country. Foreign development workers posted outside Dhaka have left their positions and returned to Dhaka as the blasts sent a wave of panic across the country.

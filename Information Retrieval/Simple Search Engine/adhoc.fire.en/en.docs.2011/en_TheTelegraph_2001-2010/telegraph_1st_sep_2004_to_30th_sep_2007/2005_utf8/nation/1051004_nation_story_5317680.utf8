 Bribery slur on French firm

 New Delhi, Oct. 3 (PTI): A sacked executive of the French defence and aviation major, Thales, which manufactures submarines, has alleged that the company had a centralised slush fund to bribe and corrupt officials to win contracts in different countries.

 Michel Josserand, former head of Thales Engineering, told French daily Le Monde that Thales had organised a secret internal system to pay commissions up to 2 per cent of the companys annual sales last year. The company had posted sales of 10.5 billion euros last year.

 The company has a 50 per cent stake in Armaris, which manufactures the French Scorpene submarines, six of which India has contracted to buy at a price of $3 billion. 

 Josserand named Africa, Korea, Greece and Italy, where paying bribes was inevitable. 

 However, there was no mention of India in his remarks.

 Refuting the charges of bribery, Thales said in a statement that Josserand was sacked for his involvement in irregularities.

 The company also denied allegations that it had paid millions of dollars in bribes and sold chemical weapons to the now-deposed regime of Saddam Hussein.

 Car bomb shatters Srinagar lull

 Srinagar, May 11: Explosives planted by separatist rebels ripped through a car in the heart of the summer capital early today, killing at least one person and leaving a trail of destruction in the morning rush hour.

 Officials said 45 people were injured in the blast in Jawahar Nagar, a densely populated residential area. Among the wounded were eight paramilitary troopers, including an officer.

 The victim was identified as Javed Ahmad Shah, a local sales tax official.

 A police officer said the main target of the militants appears to have been a four-vehicle convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force which was passing through the busy street. Three police vehicles were damaged, said an officer.

 It was a ground-shaking explosion. I saw a huge cloud of dust and the injured were crying for help, eyewitness Dilfiza Shah said. Some of them were lying in pools of blood.

 Others said a column of black smoke rose over the area after the car bomb exploded around 11. The smoke could be seen even from distant localities.

 Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who issued instructions for adequate and urgent treatment of the injured, said no civilised society can accept this.

 The blast, the deadliest attack by militants in Srinagar since India and Pakistan launched a cross-border bus service across the region early last month, ripped holes in official claims of fast-returning normality in the summer capital.

 A spokesperson for Al Nasreen called a local newspaper office to claim responsibility for the attack, which also came on a day the neighbours agreed in principle to start a new bus service between Amritsar and Nankana Sahib in eastern Pakistan, a site holy for Sikhs.

 Al Nasreen, which along with three other militant groups had threatened to turn the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad peace bus into a rolling coffin, said the blast was its first gift to the reopening of offices in Srinagar on Monday. The reference was to the durbar move when government offices shift back to Srinagar after a six-month stay in winter capital Jammu.

 The blast damaged half a dozen vehicles and several houses and shops. Bloodstained parts of vehicles and shoes lay strewn across the road.

 It was like a massive earthquake, said an officer of the State Bank of Indias Jawahar Nagar branch, located barely 10 metres from the explosion site. Windowpanes were shattered and office furniture was damaged in the explosion. The sound was deafening.

 The owner of a nearby medical shop said he was thrown up into the air and remained floating for a few seconds. The explosion was so loud that his eardrums were still hurting, he added.

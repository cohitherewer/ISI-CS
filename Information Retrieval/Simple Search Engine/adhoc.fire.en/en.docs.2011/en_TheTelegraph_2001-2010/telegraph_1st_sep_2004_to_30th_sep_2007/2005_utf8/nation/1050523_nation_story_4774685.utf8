 Jamshedpur, May 22: With their hideout near Jamshedpur now revealed, the breakaway Lok Janshakti Party MLAs today shifted to another in Ghatshila, also in BJP-ruled Jharkhand.

 Their new lodgings, a farmhouse at the Commercial Plantation and Dairy Private Limited, should be more of a safehouse. Its set almost 3 km off National Highway 33, deep inside a jungle said to be a stronghold of Naxalites.

 The farmhouse belongs to city-based businessman Deepu Mallik, who also owns the Hill View resort where the rebel Lok Janshakti leaders first set foot on Thursday before being moved to the neighbouring resort of 10th Mile Stone.

 The dissident MLAs, who plan to join hands with Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United) to help him form a National Democratic Alliance government in Bihar, were joined by more party legislators led by MLA Munna Shukla at the farmhouse late tonight. To get around the anti-defection law, the group needs to have 20 members.

 Sources said the leaders might be shifted to Orissa.

 In their first public appearance after being put up at 10th Mile Stone, where they spent about 60 hours, the legislators denied having been kidnapped by the NDA, as alleged by the Lok Janshakti central leadership. 

 The Lok Janshakti legislator from Timariya, Janak Singh, and Anil Kumar from Gaya claimed the breakaway faction has the support of 22 MLAs. At present, 15 of us are here at the resort (10th Mile Stone) and seven more will join us later in the day, Singh said.

 We have the number of MLAs we require to form a majority government in Bihar under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, Singh said before climbing into the special luxury bus arranged by local Janata Dal (United) leaders.

 All these allegations of us being kidnapped are baseless, Kumar said. We have come here on our own to form a government. We are not being pressurised by anyone.

 But they were definitely being watched closely ? from several quarters.

 A senior BJP legislator, who is a close associate of chief minister Arjun Munda, said every movement of the LJP leaders was being monitored by BJP president L.K. Advani and Munda. Both Advani and Munda are being constantly briefed about the local developments, he said.

 The BJPs opponents werent sitting idle, either. 

 Local Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders, led by district president Radhe Yadav, visited the Ghatshila resort to see things for themselves. Yadav said they had been instructed by RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav to locate the hideout.

 We have been asked by our party chief to keep an eye on the movement of LJP legislators and keep him informed of every development here, Yadav said.

 The Lok Janshakti legislators maintained they are in no mood to support any move that could help the RJD form a government. There is no question of our extending support to (the) RJD, Janak Singh said.

 Yesterday, Bihar governor Buta Singh ? who is running the state now ? had alleged the Jharkhand governments involvement in keeping the Lok Janshakti leaders at the resort.

 The governor had also held a meeting with Union home minister Shivraj Patil in New Delhi last evening.

 Today, the MLAs hit back at him, accusing him of using undemocratic means to stall the formation of a government in the state.

 If the governor has any proof that the LJP legislators, or any party, have done anything unconstitutional to try and form a government, he should reveal it, a Lok Janshakti legislator said.

 The legislators shift to Ghatshila comes after a BJP leader yesterday said the original plan had gone awry because of the revelation of the 10th Mile Stone hideout.

 The MLAs had arrived in Jharkhand in groups of two or three over several days. But while travelling to the resort from Ranchi on Thursday after meeting Munda, they had stopped at a roadside dhaba, thus drawing attraction to themselves.

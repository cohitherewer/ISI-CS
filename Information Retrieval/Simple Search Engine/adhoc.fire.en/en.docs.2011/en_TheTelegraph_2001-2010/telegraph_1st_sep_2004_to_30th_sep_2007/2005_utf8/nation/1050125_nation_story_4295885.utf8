 Slice of history over lunch at Camp Hebron

 Jalukie Zandi (Nagaland), Jan. 24: On top of the hill that houses Camp Hebron, the designated camp of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), are two thatched bamboo-mat cottages. One is the office of Isak Chishi Swu named Yaruiwo Hall (Presidential Hall) and the other is the Ato Kilonser Hall (Prime Minister?s Hall) of Thuingaleng Muivah.

 Both cottages are decorated with Naga motifs. Muivah?s office has several bamboo wind chimes hanging outside. On a flagpole in front of it, the sky blue flag of the Government of People?s Republic of Nagalim (GPRN) ? with a rainbow across it and the Star of David in the left corner ? flutters gently.

 A woman soldier of the Naga army in battle fatigues soaks in the sun on the thoughtfully constructed bamboo machan outside Muivah?s office. Nagas like to construct such machans outside their homes to sit and talk to each other informally. Next to the Yaruiwo Hall, there are children playing badminton. The families of some of the ministers of GPRN occupy some of the huts in the complex.

 Muivah?s cavalcade drives up exactly at 12.30 pm. He waves me into his office. The Prime Minister?s Hall is divided into two, a waiting room separated by a bamboo mat from the office. Muivah sits behind a glass-topped desk. ?We will talk over lunch,? he announces.

 The woman soldier serves us bowls of chicken soup in rice, an NSCN concoction. ?Remember the first time you gave us this soup, uncle?? ?Brig.? Phungthing Shimrang asks Muivah, who is universally referred to by his cadre as uncle. ?We were in the jungle at that time. So we boiled the rice and chicken together. It was very tasty,? Muivah recalls with a smile and then adds, ?hunger after all is the best sauce.?

 Had his views changed after interacting with so many representatives of the Nagas? ?Our coming back home in many ways has been very significant. People have come out to meet us and learn about the peace process. Together we are trying to understand what is best for the Nagas,? he says.

 He says he is surprised at the realism the Nagas have shown in understanding the peace negotiations. ?When we told them that both the Nagas and the Government of India would have to understand each other?s difficulties in reaching a mutually acceptable solution, they surprised us by their understanding of what we were saying. When we talked of importance of interdependence on the substantive issues involved, we found them showing an understanding that can only be called enlightened. They know that this is the only way a solution can be found that is honourable for both sides,? Muivah says.

 ?What is most important for them is that the solution should be based on the uniqueness of the history and situation of the Nagas.? 

 In fact, the ?unique history and situation? of the Nagas is the key phrase which has lent impetus to the present peace process after the previous government in Delhi headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee conceded this point. Now every Naga repeats it like a mantra. What this means is that the Nagas believe they were never a part of India either by consent, conquest or accession. From this position, the Nagas want to forge a close relationship with India which they believe should also be unique.

 Muivah dismisses reports of some tribes, especially the Chakesang and the Angamis, being unhappy with the NSCN cadre killing some of their tribesmen. He talks of the ongoing process of reconciliation and argues that such issues should not be mixed up with the ?national issue?. 

 ?Leaders and intellectuals from the Chakesang and the Angamis have come to meet us in large numbers. We have been able to understand each other very well.?

 While holding forth on the wide spectrum of Naga views consulted by the NSCN leadership, Muivah seemed satisfied with the outcome. He thinks the Naga people are ready to resolve the issue with India permanently, but he is not too sure of Delhi?s attitude. ?Sometimes one is compelled to think that since the other side does not seem to care to know about the real nature of the issue or the seriousness it requires, pessimism sets in. This has happened in the past also.?

 ?How seriously the new government in Delhi takes the Naga issue can only be comprehended in the course of the talks. If the Indian representatives start talking without realising our strength of purpose and the seriousness with which we have engaged with them over the last seven years, then that would be very unfortunate.?

 ?Despite the scepticism of the Government of India, the Naga people have come forward to seek an honourable solution. If India does not take advantage of this situation, it would be a mistake.?

 We finish our conversation with custard with canned fruit and a cup of tea. ?We have the people with us now. So I don?t fear anything,? says Muivah as I bid him goodbye.

 Caution on peace bus

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 22: The Prime Minister of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Sardar Sikandar Hayat, today cautioned that the bus service between the two Kashmirs might come to a halt if Kashmiris on the Indian side did not see tangible changes in the ground situation.

 If (the) Indian government fails to take confidence-building measures, which they have already announced in Kashmir and the people of Kashmir realise the bus service is just meant to delay the solution process, they will not accept it and we will stop it in their support, Hayat said on phone from Muzzafarabad. 

 Hayat said the ruling Peoples Democratic Party led by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and minorities in India-controlled Kashmir were legitimate representatives of Kashmiris.

 At the moment, Pakistan is holding talks with just (the) APHC (All Parties Hurriyat Conference) but there is a sitting government ? whether we accept it or not, they are there ? and other minorities like Hindus and Sikhs. So all representative groups will have to be associated in the process, he said.

 The admission comes after President Pervez Musharraf told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in April that Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti are the future leaders of Kashmir.

 Sardar Abdul Qayyum and other Kashmiri leaders had recently taken a U-turn, saying an independent state could be an option to solve the dispute.

 Hayat said he was ready to meet Indian leaders as the Hurriyat had done during Musharrafs April visit to Delhi. But he dispelled the notion that separate talks by Indian and Pakistani officials with Kashmiri leaders on both sides of the LoC were part of a trilateral process.

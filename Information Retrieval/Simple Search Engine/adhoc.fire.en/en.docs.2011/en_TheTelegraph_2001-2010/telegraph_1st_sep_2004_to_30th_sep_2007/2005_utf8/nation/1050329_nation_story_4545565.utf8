 Gujarat dissent on Advani table

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, March 28: In an attempt to sort out in-house problems before the party meets for its national executive, BJP president L.K. Advani has summoned three key dissident leaders of Gujarat ?Keshubhai Patel, Kashiram Rana and Suresh Mehta ? for a meeting in the capital on Thursday. 

 The three are spearheading a campaign for the ouster of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and claim to have the support of nearly half the BJP legislators.

 Advani was putting off an interaction with the dissident leaders for some time on the plea that Modi must be allowed to continue in the interest of Gujarat?s ?stability and development?.

 In a one-to-one luncheon meeting with Patel two weeks ago, Advani advised him to call off the oust-Modi campaign and made it clear that the chief minister would continue ?undisturbed?.

 Gujarat BJP sources, however, maintained that the controversy over Modi?s proposed US and UK visits ? starting with the visa denial by the US ? far from unleashing a ?sympathy wave? for him left people ?cold?. 

 The indifference to the swabhimaan (self-respect) rally that he called apparently bolstered the morale of the anti-Modi group and they conveyed to the central leaders that either he should ?shape up? or be ?shipped out?. 

 The BJP chief was forced to take cognisance of their ?sentiments?. Modi, who will be in Delhi tomorrow to attend a meeting of the standing committee of the inter-state council of which he is a member, is unlikely to meet Advani, said BJP sources. 

 But after meeting Keshubhai and company, Advani was likely to summon Modi to the capital and try and sort out the ?differences? that have crept up in Gujarat. 

 With the perception that Modi was on the ?defensive? now, Gujarat BJP sources said this was the ?appropriate? time for the central leaders to ?arm twist? him to endorse a state BJP president of Keshubhai?s choice which the chief minister was resisting so far.

 Keshubhai was rooting for Rajkot MP Vallabhbhai Katheria to succeed Rajendrasinh Rana whose term ends shortly.

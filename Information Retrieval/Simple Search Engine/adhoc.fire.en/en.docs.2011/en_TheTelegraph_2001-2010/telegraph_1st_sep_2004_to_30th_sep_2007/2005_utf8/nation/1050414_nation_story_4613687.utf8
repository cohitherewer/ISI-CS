 AIDS death sparks clash over blood banks

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, April 13: Residents clashed with police in Muzaffarnagar in western Uttar Pradesh after an HIV-positive nine-year-old boy succumbed to the virus suspected to have come into his body from blood taken from a private bank.

 The protests, which soon spread across the region?s most important city, were over the police failure to arrest the owner of the blood bank and the doctor who had recommended it to the boy?s father.

 Tears streamed down the faces of Vishal?s relatives as his body was handed over this afternoon after a post-mortem. The end came yesterday when the little boy, who had contracted the infection four years ago, choked from inflammation of the lungs at a city nursing home.

 Vishal and his twin brother were born in 1996 but neither was in good health. In December, after a particularly severe bout of illness, Vishal?s father Ramgopal Sharma took him to Girish Kumar, a paediatrician, who advised blood transfusion. ?Dr Kumar had asked me to get blood from a pathological laboratory-cum-blood bank in Ghaziabad run by Dr Veena Agarwal,? Sharma said.

 There was some relief but Vishal has never been in good health, said his father. ?He has been suffering from some ailment or other since he was born.?

 On July 10, 2000, Vishal again fell ill and was diagnosed with pneumonia. He was taken to Kumar, who again advised blood transfusion. ?This time, too, he advised me to get blood from Dr Agarwal?s bank,? Sharma said. Vishal?s condition improved, though marginally.

 In July last year, Sharma said his son?s condition worsened after a spell of cough and cold. ?We became suspicious and took him to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh. There, Dr Surjit Chadda, who treated him, sought the help of two other specialists and, following an HIV test, found him positive. He was found to be in an advanced stage as he had contracted the infection in 2001,? said one of Vishal?s relatives.

 In January, Vishal?s family again took him to Chandigarh where doctors said the boy was beyond any medication. Back in Muzaffarnagar, Vishal was admitted to a nursing home where he died yesterday.

 On January 14, Sharma had lodged an FIR against Kumar and Agarwal. Kumar was accused of being in hand in glove with Agarwal?s business. But the police failed to arrest the two doctors who have been in hiding since. Yesterday, when the police reached their clinics they were told both doctors had secured anticipatory bail.

 Muzaffarnagar superintendent of police Daba Sherpa said he had advised Sharma to lodge an FIR. ?The anticipatory bail is a handicap. But we are investigating the case. After the post-mortem report comes in, we will take action,? Sherpa said.

 According to the police, lawyers for the two doctors claimed the boy could have contracted the infection at other hospitals where he was treated. They even asked for a medical test on his parents.

 While the police had a tough time coping with public anger in Muzaffarnagar, elsewhere in the state people made frantic calls to the health department over mushrooming of private blood banks. 

 According to an estimate of NGOs involved in the fight against AIDS, there are about 300 private blood banks that cater to the needs of around 1,200 nursing homes in Lucknow and Kanpur. ?Most of the blood banks purchase blood from professional donors and don?t have the gadgets to screen blood properly,? said a report submitted to the state government recently by a Kanpur-based NGO.

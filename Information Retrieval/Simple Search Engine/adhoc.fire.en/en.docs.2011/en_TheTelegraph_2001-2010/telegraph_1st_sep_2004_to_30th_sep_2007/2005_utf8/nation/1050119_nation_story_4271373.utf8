 Back to business, Left in tow 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Firm in the belief that the rehabilitation of tsunami victims is on track, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has decided that the government will pay attention to certain economic initiatives he wants to unveil before the budget, but after speaking to the Left. 

 Singh will meet Left leaders over breakfast tomorrow to inform and, if possible, ?convince? them of the need to push through the initiatives for higher growth and investment, sources in the Prime Minister?s Office said.

 On top of Singh?s agenda is a comprehensive law on special economic zones (SEZs), aimed at stepping up foreign investment and exports. 

 The bill on SEZs was referred to a group of ministers after several ministers pointed out that the proposed legislation treated these zones as virtual foreign territories. Some ministers felt that the legislation would place SEZs outside the purview of Indian criminal law and the Left feared violation of labour laws. 

 The SEZ bill, which is modelled on Chinese rules, allows relaxed employment conditions, a 20-year tax holiday, duty-free imports and easier foreign investment norms. Sources said Singh will argue that such SEZs exist in China and are a major contributor to growth. 

 While his government does not wish to replicate the Chinese model blindly, Singh is convinced that SEZs are one of the best mechanisms for infrastructure development. 

 The other subject he could bring up over breakfast with Harkishen Singh Surjeet and Sitaram Yechury (CPM), A.B. Bardhan and D. Raja (CPI) and Abani Roy (RSP) is his plan to make the National Highways Authority of India an independent entity, autonomous of the road transport and highways ministry. 

 Freed from administrative interference, the PMO will have absolute control, the sources said. The other advantage in autonomy is that a bond could be floated to raise funds.

 Recently, the committee on infrastructure, headed by the Prime Minister, asked the ministry to aim at spending Rs 170,000 crore on upgrading highways over the next seven years. The other subjects up for talks are changes in laws relating to banks and financial institutions. 

 Singh had wanted to unveil his economic initiatives in the last days of 2004 but the tsunami washed away his plan. Now, he is looking at cabinet clearance before the budget session begins on February 25. 

 Singh has asked a panel of experts to pool their ideas on his three pet subjects: agriculture, infrastructure and education. The sources said he is concerned about the stagnancy in agriculture over the last 10 years and the failure of economic liberalisation to benefit rural India.

 The knowledge mission is expected to be in place soon to take a ?holistic? look at education from the primary level to centres of excellence.

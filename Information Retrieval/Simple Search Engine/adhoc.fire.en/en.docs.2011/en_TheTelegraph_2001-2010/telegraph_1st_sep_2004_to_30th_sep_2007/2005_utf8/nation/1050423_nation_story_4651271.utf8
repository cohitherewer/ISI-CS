 Australian link to Agra drug racket

 New Delhi: Agra-based doctor Brijbhushan 

 Bansal was sent to jail on Friday for his involvement in 

 an international drug syndicate that operated in the US, 

 Australia, Costa Rica and several other countries in Europe 

 and Asia, reports our special correspondent.

 Officials believe that an Australian named Shakleton controlled the global racket of supplying drugs such as valium, codeine and several versions of Viagra to clients spread across the world, according to an agency report. 

 Shakleton, the officials said, managed the websites through which orders were booked and collected payments through credit cards. The Australian, who has fled to Europe, also arranged the supply of the drugs through couriers.

 The Narcotics Control Bureau and the Drug Enforcement Agency of the US have arrested more than 20 people till date in simultaneous raids spread over several countries. Those arrested include the doctor?s sons Anil and Akhil, as well as the Delhi contact, Parveen.

 Raids on the godowns of the doctor yielded a huge quantity of narcotic drugs. His brother?s house was also raided and a concealed godown in the building sealed. 

 Bansal would allegedly supply the drugs without a licence through an online medicine delivery service and has been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.

 However, Bansal claimed that he was supplying ayurvedic medicines. ?It is not true that those medicines supplied by me were narcotic drugs,? he said. 

 UK to hike student visa fee

 London (AP): The British government on 

 Friday said it plans to increase the cost of visas for foreigners 

 studying in the country by 135 per cent.

 Officials said the hike was necessary to cover the cost of processing student visa applications, which have increased by 30 per cent in the past two years. 

 However, the proposal will not be formally approved until after the May 5 general elections in UK.

 British universities have complained that the increase will deter overseas students from studying here.

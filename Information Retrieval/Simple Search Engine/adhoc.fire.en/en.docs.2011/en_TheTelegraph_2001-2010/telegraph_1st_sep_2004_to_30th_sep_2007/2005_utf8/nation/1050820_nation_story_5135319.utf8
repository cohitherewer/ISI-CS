 Buta asks for Laloo favour

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Patna, Aug. 19: Days after weathering the transfer storm, Bihar governor Buta Singh has been sucked into another controversy over a letter he wrote to Laloo Prasad Yadav recommending the transfer of an official. 

 In an official letter dated July 15, 2005, Singh sought the railway ministers help to transfer Vijay P. Meshram, who is serving as chief materials manager (South Eastern Railway), to Mumbai as controller of stores in Central Railway. Meshram has a vigilance case pending against him. 

 The letter asking for this favour from Laloo Prasad, whose writ still runs in poll-bound Bihar, has raised the NDAs hackles.

 The BJP described Singhs letter as highly improper and said it would raise the issue in Parliament on Monday. The BJP and its Bihar ally, the Janata Dal (United), are expected to train their guns on Laloo Prasad as well.

 BJP parliamentary party spokesman V.K. Malhotra said: It was highly improper for the governor to have written to the railway minister. Both are making postings and transfers of their choice to suit each other. The coming Assembly elections cannot be free and fair in such circumstances.

 Bihar BJP president Sushil Kumar Modi said his party will launch a campaign demanding Singhs recall. We will make it an issue in the coming elections, he said.

 The governor, who was in Delhi today, whipped out the Dalit card to defend himself. He said Meshram was a Dalit official and, therefore, he was duty-bound to help him. When he was a Lok Sabha MP, Singh claimed, he always took up the Dalit cause. All I did was forward his (Meshrams) petition (to the minister). I did not write to anyone that a favour should be done. If such a request is made to me again, I will forward it to the concerned quarters, he said.

 Laloo Prasad, who met Singh, said: It is natural (for the governor) to write to me. What is the big deal if he wrote a letter? The officer in question is still where he was before and has not been posted anywhere. The minister said he had told Singh that as long as the vigilance case against Meshram was on, he would not be shifted.

 Keen to distance the Congress from Singh, party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said: Since it involves a constitutional post-holder, namely the governor, there is nothing for the party to comment.

 Singh has been under fire from the NDA following the unilateral transfer of 17 police officers last month. The action put him on a collision course with chief secretary G.S. Kang, who went on protest leave after being bypassed. But the governor spoke to Kang and persuaded him to return. The transfers were not revoked.

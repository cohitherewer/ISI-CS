The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Probe panel nails tainted 10

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: After 

 eight sittings and seven days, the Pawan Bansal inquiry 

 committee has decided that the 10 MPs caught in the cash-for-questions 

 sting operation should be expelled from the Lok Sabha.

 According to the report, tabled in the House today, the continuance of the tainted 10 in the House is untenable.

 The amounts that the MPs pocketed for raising questions are:

 Narendra Kumar Kushwaha: 

 Rs 55,000

 Annasaheb M.K. Patil: Rs 

 45,000

 Y.G. Mahajan: Rs 35,000

 Manoj Kumar: Rs 110,000 

 Suresh Chandel: Rs 30,000 

 Rajaram Pal: Rs 350,00

 Lal Chandra Kol: Rs 35,000

 Pradeep Gandhi: Rs 55,000

 Chandra Pratap Singh: Rs 

 35,000

 Ram Sevak Singh: Rs 50,000

 The details of the payments, the report says, were gathered from cobrapost.com reporter Suhasini Raj. 

 The websites reporters also told the committee that their appointments had been fixed by middlemen and each MP knew clearly why they were meeting them. Soon after the expos?, the MPs had either denied the allegations outright or claimed innocence about the meetings.

 In view of the totality of the facts and circumstances, the committee is of the opinion that the allegations of accepting money by the 10 members have been established, the report said.

 It added that the MPs conduct, which was unbecoming of them and also unethical, calls for the harshest penalty.

 Stern action also needs to be taken against middlemen, touts and persons masquerading as private secretaries of members since there are primarily responsible for inducing members to indulge in such activities.

 Apart from expulsion, the Bansal panel has also suggested imprisonment of the accused MPs.

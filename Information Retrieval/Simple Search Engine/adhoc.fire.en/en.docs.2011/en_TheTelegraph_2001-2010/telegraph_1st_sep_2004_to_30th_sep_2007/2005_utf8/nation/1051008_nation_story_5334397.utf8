 Riot relief rise on Delhi table

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: The Centre is likely to pay compensation up to 25 times more than what was decided originally by various state governments for victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

 The money could range from Rs 12.5 lakh to Rs 87.5 lakh, depending on the number of casualties in a family and value of the property lost, said an official.

 A senior home ministry official said this was one of the main recommendations of the Centre-appointed committee that was formed to work out a compensation package, including employment, for victims after the Nanavati Commission submitted its report on the riots. The Prime Minister has vetted the draft recommendations.

 The committee has been asked to submit a full report within this month. As the final compensation amount is being projected to be in the vicinity of Rs 2,000 crore, the home ministry will consult the finance ministry before presenting the report and the package to the cabinet, said an official.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil and senior officials have also taken note of some other observations the Centre-appointed panel has made. 

 One of the suggestions is keeping options open for a similar package in case the commission probing the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat suggests additional relief measures.

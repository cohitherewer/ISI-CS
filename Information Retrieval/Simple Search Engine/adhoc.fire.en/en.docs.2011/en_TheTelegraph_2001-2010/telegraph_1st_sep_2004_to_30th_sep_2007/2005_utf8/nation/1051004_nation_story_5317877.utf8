 Dogs guard new-born

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: At 5.30 this morning, a suspicious-looking bundle of clothes was spotted near a puja pandal in Jadavpur. Three stray dogs were seen hovering around it.

 When residents of Babubagan lane moved up to the bundle, they found a new-born boy wrapped in white clothes moving its clenched fists. A feeding bottle full of milk was lying alongside the baby. 

 Shocked that a new-born had been abandoned and overwhelmed that dogs had taken to playing protector, locals informed Jadavpur police.

 Suman Chatterjee, one of the organisers of Babubagan Durga Puja, said the people had no words to express their feelings.

 The dogs were almost surrounding the baby, which was lying in front of the main gate of Binodini High School, only two minutes from our puja pandal. They were keeping close watch on the baby but never trying to touch him, he said. We took the baby from the road before the police came. For a few minutes, the dogs stood silently and then trotted away.

 S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said none of the locals had expressed interest in the baby.

 We have called a doctor and checked the babys health. He is in fine shape. We have sent him to a home in Park Circus, he said.

 In May 1996, residents of Jorabagan in north Calcutta had found dogs watching over a new-born girl lying on the pavement.

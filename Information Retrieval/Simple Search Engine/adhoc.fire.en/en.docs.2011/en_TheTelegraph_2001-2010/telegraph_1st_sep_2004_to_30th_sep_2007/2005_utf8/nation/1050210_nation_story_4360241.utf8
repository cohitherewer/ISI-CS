 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 9: Suspected Maoist guerrillas have abducted 15 labourers working at a road construction site in Sambalpur district. 

 The abduction came after the MCC rebels failed to extract money from a road contractor.

 Orissa home secretary Santosh Kumar said that on Tuesday night, a group of about 40 armed rebels stormed two camps at Phulkusuma and Podanala villages under Kisinda police station area of Sambalpur district and kidnapped 19 workers. 

 They also set fire to a machine worth about Rs 1 crore being used for road construction in Phulkusum village of Sambalpur district. 

 The labourers were working under the Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) scheme when they were kidnapped around 11 pm. The Maoists later released four.

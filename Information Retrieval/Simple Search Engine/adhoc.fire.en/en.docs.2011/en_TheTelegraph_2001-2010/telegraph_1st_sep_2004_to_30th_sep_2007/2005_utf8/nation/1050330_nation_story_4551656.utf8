 More teeth for law to check fake drugs 

 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, March 29: The Centre proposes to bring in tough new laws to crack down on spurious drug manufacturers but has stopped short of including the death sentence for major offences.

 Sushma Swaraj, the health minister in the former NDA government, had publicly proposed capital punishment for makers of spurious drugs, calling them murderers of unsuspecting victims.

 The Congress-led Centre has rejected the idea, saying tightening of current laws and ensuring their strict implementation are more important.

 The bill to amend the drugs and cosmetics act of 1940 is expected to be tabled in the House this session, according to sources in Parliament.

 The draft bill has increased the prison term for a certain category of offences from five to 10 years and the related fine from Rs 10,000 to Rs 5 lakh.

 Offences now punishable with one to three years? jail and a minimum fine of Rs 5,000 will after the amendment entail three to five years in prison and a fine of Rs 1 lakh. Minor offences that carry a one-year jail term and a fine of Rs 5,000 will change to three years and Rs 1 lakh.

 The current three-year prison term and Rs 5,000 fine for a certain category of offences will change to a minimum of seven years and Rs 2 lakh.

 The draft bill allows police inspectors, and not just drug inspectors, to file charges against spurious drug manufacturers. Also, those arrested will not be given bail.

 Death of a patient from fake drugs entails a penalty of life imprisonment under the current law but none has been sentenced since Independence.

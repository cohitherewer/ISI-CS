 More Akademi members quit

 New Delhi: The flood of resignations 

 from the Sangeet Natak Akademi continued on Tuesday with 

 four more members quitting in protest against chairperson 

 Sonal Mansingh?s running of the organisation, reports our 

 correspondent.

 Culture minister S. Jaipal Reddy, however, deferred a decision on accepting the resignations. ?We are studying the matter, and nothing concrete can be said now,? he said.

 Asked whether his ministry had accepted the 

 resignations, he said: ?No resignations have been accepted 

 as the matter is under consideration.? 

 Chandigarh Sangeet Natak Akademi chairman Kamal Tiwari, his predecessor G.S. Channy, Chennai-based theatre personality B. Jayasree and Parvesh Sethi quit on Tuesday, Akademi sources said. 

 Among the others who have resigned in protest against Mansigh?s attempt to ?politicise, personalise and trivialise? the organisation are Ajoy Chakrabarty, former vice-chancellor of Rabindra Bharati University, theatre personality Kavalam Narayana Panicker and Carnatic musician Balamuralikrishna.

 The demand for Mansingh?s resignation has also mounted. Eminent Kuchipudi dancer Raja Reddy has appealed to the Odissi dancer to step down.

 Inquiry into ?Doctor Death?

 Sydney (PTI): A commission has been set 

 up under a top barrister to probe allegations against an 

 India-born surgeon, dubbed ?Doctor Death?, who has been 

 accused of deaths of at least 20 patients. 

 The Queensland premier announced that a Brisbane lawyer has been appointed to head the commission. 

 Jayant Patel fled Australia in March after nurses raised concerns about his abilities as a doctor. 

 A nurse in charge of the intensive care unit at Bundaberg hospital in Queensland, where he was a surgeon for two years, had expressed concerns that patients may have died prematurely or unnecessarily because of his surgical blunders. Patel allegedly did not wash his hands before some procedures.

 The barrister will be assisted by a former state health minister and a senior nurse. The commission, which can compel witnesses to give evidence, will examine how Patel, from Jamnagar in Gujarat, was appointed, how he was allowed to practise for so long and what can be done to prevent a repeat of the situation. 

 Foreigners in overstay net

 Kolhapur (PTI): An Ethiopian woman 

 and two other foreigners have been arrested for staying 

 in the city after their visas had expired. 

 Alemtsehay Woldu Bongale from Ethiopia and Sami Ibrahim Mohammad Ali were arrested on Monday. The other person, Muhanad Yasin Abdelkim Shaukat, a Sudanese, had gone back to his country last year before returning to India in August to pursue studies. Cases under violation of the Foreign Citizen Act, 1946, have been registered against them. 

 Kirit Raval dead

 New Delhi (PTI): Former solicitor-general 

 Kirit N. Raval died at a hospital in Israel on Tuesday. 

 Raval, 56, was suffering from cancer and had gone to the 

 US for treatment from where he was referred to the Israel 

 hospital, family sources said. 

 Medical protest

 Pondicherry (PTI): A dawn-to-dusk 

 bandh has been called by the people?s action committee here 

 on April 28 to protest the Centre?s reported proposal to 

 convert the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical 

 Education and Research into an autonomous body. The committee 

 will seek the Prime Minister?s intervention.

 Eunuch notice

 Jaipur (PTI): Rajasthan High Court 

 on Tuesday sought an explanation from the Centre and the 

 state government on a PIL seeking extension of reservation 

 benefits to eunuchs. The PIL, which said there was no special 

 policy for eunuchs, requested that they be treated at par 

 with those belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled 

 tribes or other backward classes.

 Gastro toll

 Calcutta: The gastroenteritis 

 toll at Garulia in North 24Parganas has reached five, with 

 health officials confirming two more deaths on Tuesday, 

 says a staff reporter. Over 1,500 people, including 250 

 children, have been afflicted with the disease in six wards 

 of the Garulia municipality. 

 India?s presence at the just-concluded Floralies at Ghent in Belgium, the world?s largest flower show, was restricted to only one stand of a Uttaranchal exporter and one official.

 Entrance test breather 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 14: Students aspiring to make professional courses got a breather today with Madras High Court asking the government not to finalise admissions by June 23 as earlier scheduled.

 Last Monday, the state had scrapped the common entrance exam for professional courses, including engineering and medicine, and decided that admissions would be based on Plus Two board exam results from this academic year.

 Admitting a batch of petitions from students against the abolition, Justice P.D. Dinakaran said the state should file its reply by June 23 instead of finalising admissions under the new policy.

 The actual selection of candidates shall not be finalised by June 23, advocate-general N.R. Chandran replied, drawing a sigh of relief from students and parents packing the courtroom.

 He also agreed to the judges order to extend the time for filing applications under the new admission policy till June 30.

 Justice Dinakaran, however, made it clear he did not wish to usurp the states policy-decision power. He was only bothered the decision to scrap the exam was taken after this years entrance test was held.

 The judge then placed the batch of petitions before the chief justice for necessary further orders. He said students had petitioned the courts Madurai bench also and only a decision to consolidate the petitions would ensure no contradictory orders were given.

 Advocate K.M. Vijayan said that given the unbelievable limits of competition, it was only fair that states can have an additional merit standard (the common entrance test).

 We cannot withdraw the merit scheme (common entrance test) until we find a solution that accommodates all students who have secured over 90 per cent marks, he said. You cannot change the rules after the game is played.

 Advocate-general Chandran countered that the exam abolition was a policy decision that could not be challenged. We had to start at some place and the decision was taken after the results were declared.

 Claiming the decision was rightly taken, Chandran said the Plus Two were also a qualifying exam and results were bound to be according to merit. A fresh prospectus for admission to professional courses was being issued, he said.

 With arguments remaining inconclusive, Justice Dinakaran said: Let the government take a wise decision as anxious students and parents are there on both sides. Let us not politicise the issue on larger interests.

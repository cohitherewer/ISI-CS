The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Akalis cry eyewash

 Chandigarh, Aug. 10: The Shiromani Akali Dal has termed Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs assurance of taking all possible steps within the ambit of law against those named by the Nanavati Commission as yet another eyewash, reports our correspondent. 

 Manmohan Singh should either quit or have the courage of accepting that the Congress organised the carnage of innocent men, women and children, naming them in Parliament and apologising to the nation. He has done nothing, Shiromani Akali Dal secretary Daljeet Singh Cheema said today.

 There is nothing he (Manmohan Singh) said that we have not been hearing for the last 21 years. The Sikhs dont need a certificate for the sacrifices they have made for the nation. As a Congressman, he spoke the Congresss language? He even failed to mention the massacres in Bhilai and Kanpur, Cheema said.

 The Akalis feel that the Prime Minister has shifted the onus of booking the guilty on the law minister. 

 He did not say the cases will be reinvestigated. He only said the government will look into all possible means, Cheema said, reacting to Manmohan Singhs statement in the House today.

 ?Tainted? leader surrenders

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gaya, Feb. 4: Rashtriya Janata Dal leader and former minister Surendra Prasad Yadav today surrendered before the court of the judicial magistrate of Gaya, R.R. Mishra, in connection with a criminal case pending against him. 

 Mishra has forwarded Yadav to Gaya Central Jail. 

 Yadav?s lawyer S. Qaiser Sharfuddin prayed for the RJD leader?s transfer to a hospital on medical grounds but the court did not allow it. The judicial magistrate sought a report from the medical officer of the jail on Yadav?s health.

 The criminal case pertained to the alleged assault on former MLA Jai Kumar Palit. Prabhu Nath Singh, another accused in the case, in lodged in a jail at present. 

 Earlier, Mukesh Kumar, BJP candidate from the Belaganj Assembly constituency, petitioned Patna High Court alleging that Yadav was not arrested by the authorities concerned despite the pending non-bailable warrant. 

 The high court then directed Gaya police to issue a fresh arrest warrant against Yadav. It also gave the RJD leader a deadline, which expired today, to surrender.

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: The man who brought Buta Singh and the Centre to heel for unconstitutionally dissolving the Bihar Assembly set off a burst of applause at Rashtrapati Bhavan today with his first act as the nations topmost judge.

 Immediately after being sworn in Chief Justice of India by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the 63-year-old Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal walked up to his mother, touched her feet and asked for her blessings.

 A proud Jaswant Sabharwal, in her 80s, described the day as the biggest of her life as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Opposition leader L.K. Advani and an assortment of ministers, judges and officials beamed at her.

 Chief Justice Sabharwal, whose 14-month term will end on January 14, 2007, occupies the post at a time when the President has set off a debate on whether the country should abolish the death penalty. In this, the judge is one with the man who administered the oath of office to him today ? and at odds with the peer whom he replaces as Chief Justice, R.C. Lahoti.

 Justice Sabharwal has said that as a judge of the apex court he has to uphold the constitutional validity of the death penalty, but he personally wishes it were erased from the statute book.

 Justice Sabharwal has decided several celebrated cases, such as the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MPs bribery case and the ones relating to the medical scam and unauthorised constructions in the capital. He was on the bench that cancelled the discretionary allotments of petrol pumps, terming them illegal.

 Justice Sabharwal presided over the Constitution bench that last month declared the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly unconstitutional but refused to stop the elections. He heads a bench monitoring the Rs 5 lakh crore river-linking project.

 Justice Sabharwal had served as chairman of the apex court legal services committee, executive chairman of the national legal services authority and chairman of the Cofeposa (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Act) board.

 He assumes office right away but the actual work will start on November 7 when the apex court reopens after the Diwali recess.

 I am proud of my son. He has fulfilled the dream of his father who motivated him throughout. This is the biggest day of my life, his mother said.

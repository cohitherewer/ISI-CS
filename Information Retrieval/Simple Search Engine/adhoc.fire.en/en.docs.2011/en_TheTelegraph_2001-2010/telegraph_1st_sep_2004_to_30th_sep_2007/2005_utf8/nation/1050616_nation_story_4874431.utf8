 CPM cracks college whip

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, June 15: Industry or education, the CPM cant stomach private control.

 The Marxists today showed they are not far behind Murli Manohar Joshi when it comes to favouring tighter government leash over private institutions of higher education.

 The CPM wants state governments to regulate not only the fees these institutions charge, but also what they teach. The institutions say this will strip them of autonomy.

 We have asked the UPA government to bring in a bill that will enable the states to prescribe the fees, decide the curriculum content and recruitment of students, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury told a news conference.

 Yechury was releasing the latest addition the CPM has made to its political organisational report, adopted at the party congress in March.

 Privatisation and commercialisation of education and health sectors have been going on at an alarming rate. The state has abdicated its responsibility and thrown open these sectors to the whims and fancies of private capital, the new chapter says. 

 It declares the party will launch struggles for social control over private institutions of higher education ? to regulate fees and oversee content.

 Three years ago, when the human resource development minister of the day, M.M. Joshi, had tried to bulldoze IIM Ahmedabad into drastically slashing its fees, the Left had opposed the move saying it eroded the institutions autonomy.

 As soon as Arjun Singh assumed charge of the ministry, he scrapped Joshis order and restored to the IIMs the right to decide their own fee structure. The ruling alliances common minimum programme is committed to maintaining autonomy of institutions of higher education.

 Yechury, however, said the Centre has responded positively to the CPMs new suggestion. Ministry officials would only say the concept would have far-reaching implications and would be difficult to implement.

 Yechury declared his party favours social control in both education and health. The CPM wants private hospitals and nursing homes to set aside a certain proportion of beds for needy patients.

 Education is now on the concurrent list of the Constitution. The Centre cannot intervene in educational policy matters without the states consent. 

 After taking charge of the human resource development ministry, Arjun Singh had wanted a policy that would attract more and more foreign investment in primary and higher education. The Left parties had immediately shot the proposal down.

 Yechury said that in higher education, a state government can have its own experts panel to advise the professional colleges on the curriculum.

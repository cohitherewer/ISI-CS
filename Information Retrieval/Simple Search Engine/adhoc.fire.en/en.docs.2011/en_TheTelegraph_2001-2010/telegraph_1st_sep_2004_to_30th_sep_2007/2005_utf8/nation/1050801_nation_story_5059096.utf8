 Mumbai, July 31: Anger brewed in the central and western suburbs of Sakinaka, Kalina and Kurla, the worst hit in the Mumbai floods, because of lack of water and power supply since the city was flooded on Tuesday.

 As residents went berserk after six days without drinking water or power supply in these localities, especially in the slums, a Reliance Energy official said the company would try to restore electricity in these areas by tonight.

 But with waterlogging in these areas and no let-up in the rains, there were doubts about transformers working.

 There is panic in many other parts of the city since Tuesday because of lack of power and water.

 In Panvel, a distant suburb on the Harbour Line, there was alarm again today as the water-level rose with the incessant rains and no power and drinking water. 

 Hasina, a member of the Dawoodi Bohra community, said her only hope was the food and relief being distributed by the communitys disaster management cell. The affluent community was distributing packaged mineral water from a mosque.

 But Hasina said she was extremely afraid of what this spell of rain would bring. 

 Water scarcity has hit the whole of Navi Mumbai, the new settlements along the Harbour Line. In Vashi, people have spent fortunes on packaged water. Now that is also scarce.

 Since Tuesday, we have bought water worth Rs 1,600, said H. Khan, a resident of an apartment building in sector 12 in Vashi. Water supply has resumed from this morning, she said, but the municipality water is very unclean. Her family of four is still using packaged water for drinking and cooking.

 She said she suspected that because of the high demand, the packaged water being sold in many places was fake. The seals of the last carton of bottles that I bought were very easily broken. The water did not taste right either, she said.

 Another Vashi resident, Aveek Sengupta, said he could not get any packaged water. We have to manage with whatever water is being supplied by the municipality.

 In Dombivli, a central line suburb, there is no sight of drinking water. We are trying to ration whatever little stock of drinking water we have. There are reports that the supply may not resume for two more days, a resident said.

 He said packaged water has been sold out. For purposes other than drinking, people are collecting rain water.

 These are people who live in the apartment buildings. In many slums where there is supply of drinking water, it is getting mixed with sewage water from the open drains. In slums where there is no water supply, people are drinking the rainwater as it collects in buckets placed before their rooms.

 Showbiz case

 An NGO linked to Bollywood personalities such as Mahesh Bhatt has decided to moved a PIL in the high court against the governments failure to protect life and property during the rain.

 Hiccups for Pandit return

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, July 22: A combine of four militant groups today imposed a ban on the return of Pandits to Kashmir, barely two days after leaders of the moderate faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference hugged and garlanded migrant Pandit leaders here.

 Unless they (Pandits) apologise for being the tools for Indias murderous designs on Kashmiri Muslims and join the freedom struggle, they will not be allowed to return, said a statement issued by the Farzandan-e-Milat, Save Kashmir Movement, Al-Arifeen and Al-Nasreen.

 The four groups had made headlines early this year when they issued a ban on travelling on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus and also owned responsibility for the April 6 attack at the Tourist Reception Centre in Srinagars high-security zone. The state administration had lodged the passengers of the first service in the reception centres complex two days before the journey.

 Pandits had played wiliing tools in the hands of the then governor Jagmohan, who had carried out murderous campaigns against the Muslims in Kashmir, said a statement circulated to local media offices.

 The return of Pandits could not be allowed till they individually and collectively apologised for their betrayal and conspiracies against Muslims, said the militants.

 They must also declare their intentions to fight alongside local Muslims and also show preparedness to offer sacrifices in this struggle. 

 The militants said they reserved the right to attack the local Pandits and all those assisting their possible return to Kashmir till these conditions were fulfilled by the minority community.

 Only two days ago, the moderate faction of the Hurriyat and a delegation of Pandits had resolved to work jointly for the dignified return of migrant Pandits to the Valley.

 The return of Kashmiri migrants to the Valley with a deeper sense of security and dignity unmistakably requires a favourable environment for which the Hurriyat, along with other sensible elements, will endeavour to discharge their duty as effectively as possible and Pandit intellectuals will contribute towards the forward movement as handsomely as is needed, a joint statement issued after the day-long meeting said.

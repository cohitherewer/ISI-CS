 Trekkers stranded in Lahaul

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 9: As many as 105 foreign tourists are stranded in the Lahaul region because of bad weather, though the flood situation in Himachal Pradesh is now under control.

 The tourists on a trek had earlier been stranded in remote Sarchu following constant snowfall. Sarchu is about 147 km from Manali in Lahaul Spiti. They have now moved to Jespa, a village 98 km from Sarchu on the way to Manali.

 The tourists are safe and are in a comfortable place but the authorities have been unable to rescue them because of bad weather, said Ashim Khurana, joint secretary (disaster management) in the ministry of home affairs.

 We are keeping a constant watch and would be rescuing them as soon as the weather allows us to, he said.

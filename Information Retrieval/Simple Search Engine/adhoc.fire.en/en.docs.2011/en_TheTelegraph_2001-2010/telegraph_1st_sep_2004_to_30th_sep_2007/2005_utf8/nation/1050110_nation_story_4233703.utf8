 Traders in protest threat

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Jan. 9: After doctors and engineers, it is the turn of traders to give the government an ultimatum.

 Following the abduction of Ajit Krishna Rastogi ? owner of a plywood company ? last night from Sabalpur under Didarganj police station, traders here have given the administration 72 hours to rescue him, failing which they would launch an agitation.

 In the ongoing employees? strike saga, the third round of talks held yesterday between the striking associations and the government failed to break the deadlock, forcing the Election Commission to look for alternatives to conduct the elections next month.

 The poll panel is understood to have prepared a list of about 51,000 bank and school employees as well as retired government workers to conduct the first phase of the polls on February 3. If needed, the commission will use their services in the next two rounds as well, a source said.

 On the medical front, the one-day token strike by the Bihar unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) yesterday did not cause much damage as emergency services in the medical colleges and most private hospitals here were left untouched.

 The IMA working committee today decided to give another 72 hours to the government to rescue abducted doctor U.K. Raja, failing which it might consider going on an indefinite strike.

 However, the situation in Purnea and Kosi divisions is already grim, as doctors there have stayed away from work. ?We are scared to come out of home and phone calls make us shiver. Patients suffer the most if doctors are not able to report for work,? said S.N.Q. Nasser, IMA president, Purnea.

 Even as Madhepura and Purnea police hunt for the abductors of Raja, Patna-based doctor S.S. Jha has told the IMA that he has been asked to pay Rs 5 lakh by January 10. He received the extortion call two days ago.

 This prompted the IMA to state that at least 500 doctors have so far received ransom calls, most of which have gone unreported. ?What does the government want us to do for security ? leave the state?? state IMA president Vijay Shankar Singh asked. 

 State engineers too have threatened to go on an indefinite strike if the killers of PWD engineer Aditya Kumar Thakur and two others are not arrested. Unidentified criminals had killed Thakur, contractor Mannan Singh and civil engineer Aftab Alam Khan at Muzzafarpur on December 31.

 Court date for Jeshma killer

london (PTI): The prime suspect 

in the rape and murder of Indian teenager Jeshma Raithatha will appear in a Latvian 

court on Sunday, the first stage of extraditing him to the UK.

 Viktors Dembovskis was arrested in his home town of Livani.

 Jeshmas parents, Suresh and Manjula, are said to be elated at the news of the arrest. It is difficult for her parents to be happy in the circumstances. But they are elated that someone has been arrested so soon, an aunt said.

 Officers from Scotland Yard had been liaising with Interpol and the Latvian authorities in their hunt for Dembovskis. Two members of the forces murder investigation team have flown out there to oversee the operation. As Latvia joined the EU in May last year, extradition procedures are likely to be put on fast track.

 Dembovskis, a car wash attendant, disappeared from the home he shared with other immigrant workers, close to where Jeshma lived in Greenford, west London, shortly after the 17-year-old was reported missing on May 16. 

 His mother, Danilova, said police had called for him while she was watching TV. Viktors answered the door. They were in the kitchen discussing his trip to London. They said he must go with them. They took his clothes, t-shirts, underpants and a sweater. 

 Danilova said her son wanted to be a lorry driver as a schoolboy. But the death of his brother and father affected him so much that he took to drinking and got into bad company.

 Koirala at Delhi door

new delhi: Nepali Congress chief 

and former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala arrived here on Saturday for talks 

that analysts said could well prove to be the turning point in defining Indias 

future policy on its Himalayan neighbour, reports our special correspondent.

 Over the next few days, Koirala is likely to meet defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and leaders of the Left parties. 

 As he will be here for some days, Koirala could also hold talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance.

 Although there was speculation that the king might prevent Koirala from leaving the country, the Nepali Congress had deliberately made his proposed trip known to test how serious Gyanendra is about restoring democracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Salem was Sanjay to Monicas family

 OUR BUREAU

 Monica: Whats in a name?

 Dec. 1: Ramil Kamal Malik, Ansalan Ali? Sanjay.

 Abu Salem had many aliases, but one of them stands out from the rest. It was invented for him by Monica Bedi ? not to dodge police but to ensure that her parents in Norway didnt throw a fit if they ever guessed the nature of her relationship with her friend.

 Father Prem Bedi has told STAR News that her daughter had told him her friend ? the family felt that he could be more than that ? was a Hindu.

 She introduced him by another name? he was known to us as Sanjay. We didnt know that his name was Abu Salem, he said. She said that he was a friend. We felt that there was something, but she told us that he helped her films. She didnt tell us anything else.

 I found out (about Salems real name and his relationship with Monica) only when they were arrested in 2002.

 He went on to claim: Monica also didnt know that the man she was involved with was Abu Salem. Monica didnt know anything. She only found out the truth after moving to Dubai.

 The father at first said he had never met the man but later admitted: I met him in Portugal, after they were arrested.

 I met him for 5-6 minutes. He looked like an innocent, smallish man. He greeted me like a Hindu, said pranaam. I am amazed that he is believed to be responsible for such crimes.

 Even if you meet him ? you will not believe that he is an infamous gangster. He may have been acting, but I couldnt tell. When I asked him if his name was Abu Salem, he said no ? I am being framed. He used to call me papa. He said, Papa, I am innocent.

 How does he plan to help his daughter?

 I am going to India next week; I will do all that I can. She is my daughter. My brother has gone to help out. We will spend all that is needed. She is innocent. She was not involved with the passport forgery. Her only fault was that she travelled on the passport.

 The last time he spoke to her, Prem Bedi says: She was crying, and she was saying that I am trapped. We always wanted her well-being.

 The father is clear about what he will do once the courts free Monica, which he seems to believe they will.

 Well bring her back to Norway. We have filed a case in this regard here. People in India will hate her. She has no future left in films. 

 Would the parents ever agree to Monica marrying Salem, if they arent already? Its mother Shakuntalas turn to answer.

 Would I ever agree to her getting married (to Salem)? I am a Hindu and he is a Pakistani (sic). She didnt marry Salem. She was trapped. Norwegian children are very innocent.

 Salem probe team plea

 Mumbai police today moved a writ petition challenging the Tada court judges order allowing not more than two police officers to question Abu Salem in their custody. The high court will hear the plea tomorrow.

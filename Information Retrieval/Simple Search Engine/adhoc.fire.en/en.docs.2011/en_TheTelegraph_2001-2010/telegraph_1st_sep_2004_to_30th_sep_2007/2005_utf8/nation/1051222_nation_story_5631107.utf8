 Lost amp; found sandbar in magic union

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Port Blair, Dec. 21: Sightings of sparkling white specks in the sea has seen Port Blair break out in whoops of joy over the past few days.

 The raging sea that snuffed out lives and gobbled up land a year ago has, days before the tsunami anniversary, begun returning part of what it took away: a couple of sandbars and beaches.

 This is perhaps natures way of saying sorry for what happened, said Rana Mathews, public relations officer with the Andaman and Nicobar directorate of tourism.

 The beautiful Cinque Islands, lying 39 km south of Port Blair, were known the world over not only for their tropical rain forest and rare corals but also for a half-kilometre sandbar connecting the twin islands.

 The tsunami waves had engulfed the sandbar, separating the two islands. Now, with the return of the bar, thanks to steady changes in the seabed, the islands are reunited again.

 For the past few days, Port Blair had been abuzz with talk that the bar had been sighted again. The Telegraph team today had an enchanting view of the islands and the bar from just above 2,000 feet, aboard an MI-8 Air Force helicopter on the flight back to Port Blair from Hutbay.

 Known for its scuba diving and snorkelling facilities apart from the rich marine life around it, the sandbar is used by people to trek from one island to the other.

 Part of the beach and sandbar of Ross and Smith Island, too, has resurfaced.

 When we got the news, we were simply overjoyed, Mathews, the PRO, said.

 Ross Island, which used to be the capital of Port Blair under British rule, was devastated by the tsunami waves, but had always been popular for its historical importance.

 Spread over 0.6 square kilometres, the island is a 10-minute boat ride from Port Blair and was a favourite retreat for the British rulers. For their Indian subjects, it signified a dreaded penal settlement.

 More good news has arrived with geologists reporting that Jollybuoy, too, is getting back its lost beach.

 The sea had eaten into this beautiful island near Port Blair, but the beach is slowly coming back to normal. We are overjoyed; so seem the tourists, a tourism department official said.

 Officials expect that with the beaches reappearing and tourist flow increasing, the good days will be back again.

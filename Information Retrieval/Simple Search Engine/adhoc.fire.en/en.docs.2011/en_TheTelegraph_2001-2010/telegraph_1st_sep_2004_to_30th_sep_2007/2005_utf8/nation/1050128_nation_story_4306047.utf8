 Tsunami clouds R-Day 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Jan. 27: The sea was calm and almost beautiful in the background. But in their mind, everybody saw the giant killer waves and the flotilla of corpses and debris left behind exactly a month ago by the tsunami. 

 The gloom of the tragedy hung heavy on the curtailed Republic Day parade, held on the beachfront under the majestic sculpture of the Mahatma on the Marina sands. Also weighing on the minds of the organisers was the rumour of another tsunami striking the shores on January 26. 

 The whole function was over in less than 30 minutes, sans cultural programmes by schoolchildren and folk artistes and tableaux prepared by the various departments. The march-past was kept to a formal minimum followed by some floats of the army and air force. 

 After governor S.S. Barnala hoisted the Tricolour, in a sombre atmosphere, Shakul Hameed, a 56-year-old siddha (traditional medicine) doctor and social worker from Dindigul, cheerlessly received the government?s Kottai Ameer Communal Harmony Award. 

 He has been working tirelessly to promote inter-faith harmony in Dindigul and was also ?instrumental in securing? the man who had garlanded Ganesh idols with chappals at Palani town in December 2001. 

 As the grief borne by the tsunami hung in the air, similar was the predicament of other awardees, including Natarajan, a tehsildar from Tirunelveli. Bound to a wheelchair and tears streaming down, he received the Anna Medal for Gallantry for taking on the sand mafia that resulted in multiple injuries to his left arm, left thigh and right hip. 

 While Chennai was busy with the Republic Day programme, the district collectors of the worst-affected Nagapattinam, Kanyakumari and Cuddalore came out to the beaches of their areas to calm fisherfolk, who were panic-struck since the rumours of another tsunami began circulating. 

 Anger also found an expression as residents of Sathurangapattinam, a coastal fishing hamlet near Mamallapuram, blocked traffic and held up 10 government buses to protest against the delay in disbursement of relief. 

 ?We still don?t know what to do, torn away from our only source of livelihood, fishing,? said Ganesan, echoing many who have received cash relief from the government but are unsure about the future.

 Grief and fear still haunt most of the survivors. ?The fate of about 20 boys playing cricket on December 26 last near the mouth of the Adyar River when the tsunami struck is still not known,? said fishermen Selvam.

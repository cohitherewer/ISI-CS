 Blast hero fights on

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The blast has left him badly burnt and without vision or hearing; but Govindpuris hero will win this battle, too. The bus driver whose bravery and quick thinking saved dozens of lives at the site of the terrorists third strike in Delhi will live, doctors said today.

 The 10-member medical team treating Kuldeep Singh at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences said that despite suffering 42 per cent burns, the patient is out of danger. Kuldeeps right eye, which suffered extensive damage in the explosion, has responded well to treatment and he can now see up to a metre ahead of him.

 The right eye will make more progress and I am sure his left eye, too, will respond well. Kuldeeps deafness seems temporary and will be cured soon. He has also managed to come out of the trauma successfully, said Dr Rajpal, additional professor of ophthalmology.

 Kuldeep had acted quickly as soon as the conductor of his bus spotted the bag left behind by the bomber. The two of them not only evacuated the passengers from the crowded bus but also managed to hurl the bomb away.

 My prayers have been heard by the Almighty. Doctors say he will be able to see and hear again. There can be no better news for me, said Kuldeeps seven-month pregnant wife Nigam. As she came out of the intensive care unit, she even managed a smile.

 Today she received another piece of good news, too. Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who visited Kuldeep at hospital, announced a permanent government job for the driver and a Rs 3-lakh compensation besides free treatment.

 Kuldeep will take about two more weeks to recover fully from the physical injuries and mental trauma.

 His friends and relatives revealed that the man had always been popular in his village for his courage and helpful nature.

 I can remember so many instances when he has helped people he didnt even know. He would pick a fight to save some underdog?. Our whole mohalla at Naraina village has been praying for his recovery, said friend Sonu Arora.

 Pollutant ban, minus stand-in

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: India has decided to ratify an international convention to eliminate 12 toxic chemicals ? called the dirty dozen ? but lacks a coordinated plan of action for alternative technologies, a non-government agency has said.

 The cabinet decided last month to ratify the United Nations Environment Programme Stockholm Convention aimed at the phased reduction and elimination of 12 persistent organic pollutants ? eight organochlorine pesticides, two industrial chemicals and two industrial wastes. India has already banned eight of these.

 The big three persistent organic pollutants in India are DDT and the two industrial wastes ? dioxins and furans, said Ravi Agarwal, executive director of Toxics Link, a non-government agency. But we dont seem to have a well-thought-out process in place yet to evaluate and induct alternatives.

 The malaria control programme in India continues to use DDT spray to tackle mosquitoes. Dioxins and furans are generated as by-products in the paper and pulp manufacturing industries, and during metal smelting, medical waste incineration and open burning of metal wastes.

 The Stockholm Convention, which took shape in 2001, is aimed at eliminating what environmental scientists believe are the most toxic chemicals that can persist for years in the environment, slip into the food chain and affect human health.

 Agarwal said the Convention offers opportunities for India to access alternative technologies.

 But were not looking at the available options closely enough, he told a workshop here organised by Toxics Link to identify initiatives needed from the government to eliminate the pollutants.

 Agarwal said chlorine bleaching in the paper industry and metal smelting and waste-burning processes generate dioxins and furans. There exist alternative technologies, such as non-chlorine processes and safer waste recycling processes. We need an urgent examination of options, sector by sector, he added.

 Toxics Link has also said that India lacks the monitoring facilities for some pollutants. There are not enough data on stockpiles of such chemicals despite studies indicating unusually high levels of environmental and food contamination at some sites.

 While the Central Pollution Control Board is expected to track environmental pollutants in the country, it appears to lack the resources for intensive and sustained examination of the persistent pollutants, Agarwal said.

 Earlier this year, delegates reviewing the Stockholm Convention proposed the addition of five new chemicals to the list of the dirty dozen. One of the five is lindane, which is widely used and produced in India.

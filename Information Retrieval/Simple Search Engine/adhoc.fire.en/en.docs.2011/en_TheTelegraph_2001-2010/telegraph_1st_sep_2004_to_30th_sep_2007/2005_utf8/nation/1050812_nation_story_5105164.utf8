 After Tytler, BJP fears for Modi head

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: The boot is now well and truly on the other foot. With Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs apology for the violence against Sikhs, the resignations of Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar and the assurance of re-opening cases against those named by the Nanavati Commission, the BJP rued that the government had acted faster than it expected and pre-empted the issue from snowballing.

 The government has not only blunted the edge of our campaign, it has put a lid on it, a senior BJP MP said. 

 There was also nervousness in the BJP camp over what the Nanavati Commission ? inquiring into the Godhra train burning and the riots that followed ? has in store for Narendra Modi and the Gujarat government.

 A Rajya Sabha member said: We imagined Modi had nine lives. But we pitched our demands on the Nanavati report (on the 84 riots) so high that we will have no defence left if the Congress and the Left ask for Modis head after the other report is out.

 The BJPs fear was compounded by the fact that some NDA allies have asked for Modis resignation as Gujarat chief minister after Tytler and Kumar stepped down from the Union ministry and the Delhi rural development board, respectively. 

 Janata Dal (United) MP Lallan Singh said: From the start, we have been saying Modi should go. A precedent has been now been set.

 Singh, who is close to Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar, was seen by the BJP as reflecting the secular concerns of his party before the Bihar elections. 

 A BJP source said: The Dal thinks it got quite a few Muslim votes in the last elections. If Laloo Prasad Yadav uses Tytlers resignation to hammer home the message that unlike the Congress, the BJP is unprepared to touch its leaders who were involved in communal violence, it could impact Muslim voters. So Nitish Kumar wants us to do something about Modi. 

 Trinamul Congresss Rajya Sabha MP Dinesh Trivedi echoed the demand, but the views are believed to be Mamata Banerjees. BJP sources said she, too, wants to salvage her secular credentials before the Bengal elections next year. 

 The Biju Janata Dal, the third ally to seek Modis ouster, has had a souring of relations with the BJP in Orissa. The most recent bone of contention was the Posco divestment. 

 For the record, BJP parliamentary party spokesperson V.K. Malhotra ruled out Modis resignation. The day he is chargesheeted, he will go. So far, no court of law or commission has indicted him.

 Asked to comment on an observation of the Supreme Court, in one of the several strictures it passed against the Gujarat government, that modern-day Neros were looking elsewhere when innocents were burning, Malhotra said: Nero does not refer to ( Atal Bihari) Vajpayee, (L.K.) Advani or Modi. It refers to some police official.

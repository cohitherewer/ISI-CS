 PM guest role in Sonia show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may limit his role in the Bihar Assembly poll campaign to a token appearance as the main responsibility for mobilising votes will again be shouldered by Sonia Gandhi. 

 According to a tentative schedule drawn up by Congress poll managers, the Prime Minister is expected to hit the campaign trail during the latter part of the four-round polls ? perhaps just for a day. The third and the fourth phases of polling are scheduled on November 13 and 19. 

 At least for the next couple of weeks, partys Bihar poll managers expect Singh to be preoccupied with relief and rehabilitation efforts in the earthquake-affected Jammu and Kashmir. 

 As the UPAs star campaigner, Sonia is expected to address at least seven meetings spread over two rounds of visits to Bihar.

 Sonia will launch her campaign on Saturday, addressing at least three meetings that day ? two of them in Patna and the other in Bhagalpur. In the state capital, it will be a joint rally with Laloo Prasad Yadav and Sharad Pawar. 

 Sonias initial round of campaigning will cover constituencies which will go to polls in the first and the second phases on October 18 and 26.

 She might have considered a second round of campaigning for the first two phases of polls but for a plan to visit again the quake-hit areas of Jammu and Kashmir.

 Sources said the Congress chief is keen to ascertain for herself the progress on relief and rehabilitation.

 The Congress presidents second round of campaigning in Bihar will be for the last two phases. She will then address at least one rally with leaders of the alliance partners.

 Contrary to an announcement earlier, the CPM will not join the joint rallies.

 The CPM is part of the truncated UPAs seat-sharing arrangement, but it has not signed the common minimum programme of the RJD, the Congress and the NCP.

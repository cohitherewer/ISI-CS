 Sunny Deol film sparks protests

 Ludhiana (PTI): Protests at cinema halls marred the release of the Sunny Deol-starrer Jo Bole So Nihal on Friday. A group of people suspected to be activists of the Akali Dal raised slogans outside Shingar cinema hall in Ludhiana, pelted stones and tore posters of the film.

 In Hoshiarpur, over 35 activists of various Sikh organisations staged a dharna in the complex of Swarn Theatre. The activists shouted slogans against the films producer, I.P.S. Chadha, and the director for naming it after the sacred Sikh slogan Jo Bole So Nihal Sat Sri Akal. Police forced the activists to vacate the complex after some of them turned violent and broke a showcase window.

 Chadha had said on Thursday: (The) Akal 

 Takht formed a committee to assess the film?and cleared 

 it after removal of some objectionable scenes and the title 

 song.

 The committee had gone to Mumbai to watch the film and had asked Chadha to specify in the posters that it was not a religious film, he said.

 The committee had objected to a scene where the hero, a Sikh, was shown smoking a cigarette. But Chadha said he had clarified that there was also a scene that showed the heros mother slapping him for smoking.

 Chadha said the Censor Board of Film Certification had also given its final nod after Punjab and Haryana High Court had issued a directive for a review of the films title.

 Scottish scheme for students

 Jalandhar (PTI): The Scottish government will launch a scheme for non-European Union foreign students that will allow them to stay and work in Scotland for up to two years after they graduate.

 Students who have graduated with a higher national diploma from a Scottish further education college or a first degree, masters degree or PhD from a Scottish higher education institution will be eligible to apply, said Nilesh Tandon, the director of international affairs of British Counselling Education Services.

 Under the scheme, a work permit will not be required and there will be no restrictions on the nature of the job, he said.

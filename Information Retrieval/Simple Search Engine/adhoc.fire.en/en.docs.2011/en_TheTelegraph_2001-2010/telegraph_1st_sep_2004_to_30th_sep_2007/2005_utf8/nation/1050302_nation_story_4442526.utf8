 Chipko push for Greenpeace

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, March 1: Greenpeace International?s executive director Dr Gerd Leipold is in India to imbibe the experiences of Chipko leader Sunderlal Bahuguna on the eve of his organisation?s expansion in the Northeast with a centre in Calcutta.

 The chief of the environmental group said he was impressed by the non-violent protests of Bahuguna over the decades ? the most recent being the one in Karnataka against toxic effluents flowing into the river Kali in Uttara Kannada district. 

 ?It?s an honour and a learning experience. I am looking forward to this meeting (with Bahuguna in Dehradun). I want to know all about his experience and how he sees environmental issues and organising people to show their resistance to decay. I hope to get a lot out of this meeting,? he said.

 The inputs gathered from this discussion would help the organisation to campaign against the entry of genetically engineered rice and use of toxic chemicals by various industries, Leipold said. 

 ?We plan to recruit more people in India this year as part of an initiative to enhance our presence in developing countries. We feel that India is of special interest because it has a hoary past of non-violent methods of expression of resentment.? 

 The entry of genetically modified crops, he added, would pose a threat to India?s bio-diversity as most of these new varieties would be untested.

 In addition, Greenpeace would seek a ban on foreign fleets that cart away fish and deprive the poor of their staple diet. It would campaign for accountability of the Union government and corporate entities in environmental issues as well as for people?s participation in the decision-making process. 

 The group would take the support of regional non-government organisations on each of these issues, the executive director said.

 As part of its expansion, the organisation would set up a centre in Calcutta this month. It would venture into the east for the first time through this centre. 

 ?We are a small group when compared with the size of the population of India. We want to increase our presence in more number of cities and enhance our activities in the next couple of years. 

 ?We would like to take the support of local people with us (in each of these cities). We are going to start a direct dialogue with the people in Calcutta through 20 young and dynamic men. Our focus will be global but we would like to understand the issues and increase our involvement in environmental issues of the region,? said G. Ananthapadmanabhan, executive director of Greenpeace, India.

 Greenpeace India would campaign for a toxic-free, sustainable and peaceful future for all species on this planet, he added.

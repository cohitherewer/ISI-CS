 CBI eyes Monica 

custody

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: The CBI may get a chance to delve deeper into the underworld network if the Secunderabad special court permits it to take Abu Salems companion Monica Bedi in custody tomorrow.

 The agency will move an application seeking Monicas custody on grounds that both Salems and her fake passports were delivered to the same Mumbai address in 2001.

 Government sources said Monicas custody is being sought primarily to cross-check information Salem has provided CBI sleuths and central intelligence agency officials.

 Monicas long association with Salem, especially during the turbulent times of his life, is a sure indication that Monica would be knowing many intricate details of the underworld, Salems assets, associates, past deeds and plans, a senior official said.

 Any detail, including the minute ones, will be crucial to get the whole picture of the underworld, including the kingpin Dawood.

 Sources said the CBI has enough time to squeeze out all the information from Salem. It is moving very slowly and using psychological techniques.

 The CBI can keep Salem in its custody for 30 days in each case under Tada, which means a total of 90 days in three cases under which he has been extradited, a source said.

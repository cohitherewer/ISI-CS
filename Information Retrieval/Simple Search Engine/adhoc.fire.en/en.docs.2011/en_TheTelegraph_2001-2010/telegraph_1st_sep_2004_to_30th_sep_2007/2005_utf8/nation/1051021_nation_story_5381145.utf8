 Diwali drive to wash off stain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 20: Their image battered after the string of sexual offences involving policemen, Mumbai police have cancelled their Diwali Mela and promised to step up efforts to control the menace.

 Diwali Mela, a week-long programme organised by the police department, includes musical nites, plays and award ceremonies with Bollywood stars making regular appearances.

 The recent rape cases have seriously damaged the image of the police department, joint commissioner of police Subhash Awate said. 

 Senior police officials expressed their disappointment? at a weekly meeting and suggested that Diwali celebrations if conducted would be an embarrassment in these circumstances, the joint commissioner added.

 Awate said the cancellation of Diwali Mela would send a strong message to the force that the department would not tolerate indiscipline on duty.

 Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy, who had ordered the suspension of at least nine alcoholic police constables in the aftermath of the Marine Drive rape case in April, expressed shock and disappointment that his action had failed to make much impact. 

 Roy had also dismissed Sunil More, the constable who allegedly raped a 17-year-old inside a Marine Drive police chowki.

 Deputy chief minister and state home minister R.R. Patil had convened a meeting of senior police officials yesterday, where they discussed stringent remedial measures against errant personnel. 

 Conducting regular breath analyser tests at police stations and preparing addiction reports on policemen known for absenteeism were some of the suggestions that came up at the meeting.

 The issue was discussed in detail. We will evolve an effective mechanism of identifying errant officers who are irregular at work and prone to alcohol. We will ensure a way of constantly monitoring their conduct, additional chief secretary A.P. Sinha said.

 The home department has already prepared a list of 100 police officials who are likely to face disciplinary action within a fortnight, a senior police official said.

 Pressure mounted on the government today to take immediate steps after womens groups staged a demonstration outside the state police headquarters in south Mumbai.

 Activists shouted slogans and later submitted a memorandum to director-general of police P.S. Pasricha, demanding the immediate suspension of accused policemen and trials in fast-track courts. 

 Mariam Dhawle of the All India Democratic Womens Association said the DGP has issued a letter asking police commissioner and superintendents across the state not to tolerate dereliction of duty.

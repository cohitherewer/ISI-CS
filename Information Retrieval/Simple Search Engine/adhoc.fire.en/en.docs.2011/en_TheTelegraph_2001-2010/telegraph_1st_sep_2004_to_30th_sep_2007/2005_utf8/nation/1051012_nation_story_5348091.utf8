 Polite boot to brigadiers

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: The trespassing Indian soldier returned by Pakistan wasnt the only one from the Indian Army to venture across the Line of Control (LoC) during Saturdays earthquake. Two Indian brigadiers, too, had reportedly entered Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

 These two senior officers, who had been on LoC duty when the quake struck, had the best of intentions, sources said. They had realised that emergency humanitarian help was needed on the other side.

 It isnt clear whether the brigadiers had crossed over to help Pakistani soldiers or civilians. Troops patrolling the PoK side appreciated the two Indian officers gesture but requested them to return, saying the Pakistan army could handle the situation on its own.

 The shared tragedy brought on by the killer quake has seemingly softened both armies towards each other after decades of bitter hostility. The ordinary Indian soldier who had strayed into PoK, too, was returned without a hitch.

 The soldiers and civilians in PoK were hit much more severely than those in Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian soldiers were closest to the scene of the tragedy and had instantly offered help to the other side. They had not waited to seek their superiors permission.

 Seemingly, Islamabad is not comfortable with the idea of throwing PoK open to the Indian Army even if that helps emergency rescue and relief operations. This is probably why President Pervez Musharraf declared that his country did not need extra hands to cope with the disaster in PoK.

 While Pakistan has politely declined the Indian Armys offers of emergency help, civilians on the Indian side insist that only the army handle rescue, relief and rehabilitation.

 When Sonia Gandhi and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee visited the worst-affected forward areas on Sunday, grief-stricken residents reportedly told them to let the army be in charge of relief efforts.

 DMK chief under fire

 Tiruchirappalli (TN), July 17: M. Karunanidhis alleged attempt to stop the Tamil Na-du Congress from raising the Kamaraj rule revival plan met with stiff resistance at a rally last night with E.V.K.S. Elangovan blasting attempts by the DMK and the PMK to suppress his partys activities.

 It is ridiculous to suggest that while parties like the DMK, PMK and the MDMK reserved their right to criticise the Centre on certain policies, Congress members in Tamil Nadu should not even speak about Kamaraj or reviving Kamaraj rule or anything else, said Elangovan, the Union minister of state for commerce and industry.

 The former state Congress presidents salvo was fired at a mammoth rally held to celebrate the 103rd birth anniversary of late party leader Kamaraj Nadar and the centenary of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.

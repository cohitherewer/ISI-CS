 Barred in Bihar, allies cry for election 

 reforms 

 - ?Unfair? salvo at poll panel

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, March 1: Top leaders of the United Progressive Alliance and the Left expressed concern over the Election Commission?s ?unfair? handling of the Assembly elections in Bihar and decided to set up a committee to look into electoral reforms. 

 The leaders, who met over dinner at the Prime Minister?s residence tonight, said Nirvachan Sadan had transgressed by debarring several Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leaders and MPs like Akhilesh Yadav, Kanti Singh and Sadhu Yadav from entering their constituencies on the day of polling. 

 Raghuvansh Prasad, an RJD minister, raised the issue, which had several leaders from both sides, including defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, voicing concern. RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav was earlier embroiled in a spat with the Election Commission over publicising the Godhra carnage report during campaigning. 

 The UPA-Left coordination strategy in Parliament during the budget session was also discussed. The Left leaders agreed to Mukherjee?s request not to move any cut motions to the budget proposals as it would embarrass the ruling coalition. The Congress minister also asked the Left not to oppose the ordinance on patents. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh presented a ?report card? to his UPA colleagues and Left partners on his government?s implementation of the common minimum programme during the last nine months. 

 The government seemed to be sending a signal through the booklet to the Left, which wages battles on whether the government is straying from the commitments in the document, that it was acting within the framework of the common minimum programme. 

 ?The Prime Minister took the initiative to prepare a report on his government?s achievements,? said an official in the Prime Minister?s Office.

 ?There had been several inquiries about the CMP. And this is the first part of the report. The second part will come out at the end of 2005,? he said. 

 The booklet highlights the people-oriented measures taken by the government, on the suggestion of the Left as well as the National Advisory Council headed by alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi. 

 The priority areas listed in it include agriculture, infrastructure, employment, education, health, water and urban renewal. 

 The booklet begins with the National Employment Guarantee Bill. ?The draft bill draws on the recommendations of the NAC headed by Sonia Gandhi,? it says. The Left, however, finds it inadequate and wants it to be redrafted. 

 As the booklet focussed on the common minimum programme, the fruit of lengthy deliberations between Congress and Left leaders, it has left out the non-controversial aspects of the government?s proposals for economic reforms. 

 It is a consensus document and, therefore, does not contain prickly policy issues that have become a bone of contention between the partners. For instance, the common agenda does not talk about the cap on foreign investment in certain sectors, one of the most fractious issues now. 

 Left leaders, however, said the UPA government?s list of achievements as presented by Singh in the booklet does represent a shift in its approach.

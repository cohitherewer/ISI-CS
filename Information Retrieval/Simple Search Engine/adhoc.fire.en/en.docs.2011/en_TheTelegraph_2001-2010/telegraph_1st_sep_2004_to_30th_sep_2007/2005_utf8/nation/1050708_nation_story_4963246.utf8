 Night hole in Ayodhya shield

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, July 7: Had the terrorists struck at night, they might have succeeded: the Ayodhya complex security didnt have night surveillance equipment.

 And anyway, the closed-circuit television system had gone on the blink when the attack took place.

 The Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government have now launched a security drive for monuments and shrines across the state. At its focus are the Taj Mahal, the Gyanvapi Mosque and the Kashi Vishwanath temple, and the Shahi Mosque-Krishna Janmabhoomi campus in Mathura.

 The Taj was included after intelligence agencies said terrorist outfits might target it to attract global attention.

 The Centre is also considering a security overhaul at the Ayodhya complex. There are complaints that the Provincial Armed Constabulary and state police guards had been slack on Tuesday, and this had allowed the militants to breach of the yellow (outer) zone and get to 70 metres of the temple.

 Union home secretary V.K. Duggal will meet central police organisations, intelligence agencies and the Uttar Pradesh police chief next week, ministry sources said.

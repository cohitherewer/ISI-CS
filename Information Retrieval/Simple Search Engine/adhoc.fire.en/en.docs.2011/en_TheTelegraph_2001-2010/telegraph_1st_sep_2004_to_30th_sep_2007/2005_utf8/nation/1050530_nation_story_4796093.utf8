 Capital road repair in private care

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, May 29: The two Ring roads, Delhis main arterial paths, will be repaired and maintained by private players to give an international look to the capital, which is hosting the Commonwealth Games in 2010 and bidding for the Asian Games in 2014.

 For the first time, the city will have vacuum cleaners of six metric tonne-capacity sucking up the dust and mechanised sweepers mounted on trucks cleaning the 82-km stretch. Special patrols will monitor repairs on the roads.

 The project, to be implemented in three months, follows the new Mass Rapid Transit System, flyovers, privatisation of streetlights, power distribution and opening of private-owned liquor vends to help present an international Delhi.

 According to Public Works Department officials, this is the first time that citys roads will be taken up for such a venture ? national highways like Delhi-Jaipur that have turned toll roads are privately maintained.

 While the operation is on, although in a limited way, in some areas in Mumbai, for instance Napean Sea Road, it is expected to soon become visible in the coming months in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Hyderabad and Kerala.

 As the Ring roads are not being newly constructed, privatisation of their repair and upkeep will not turn them into toll roads. It will, however, ensure routine maintenance of all assets, facilities and services that are either existing or created. These would include carriageway, footpaths, sidewalks, subways, medians, drainage and signs.

 The private players will also provide incident management by way of road patrol and surveillance. An executive engineer will be put in charge of these roads while three assistant engineers will inspect them everyday, listing jobs to be done like removal of carcasses.

 Median fencing, road marking, road property management, horticulture maintenance and upgrade will also be undertaken.

 Besides building an image of being a world-class city like London, the project proposes to be economical. The PWD currently spends Rs 25 crore every year just on maintaining the Ring roads. Privatisation will reduce this cost to Rs 21 crore.

 PWD chief engineer K.K. Mutreja said the project would take Delhi to a totally different era.

 For the safai karamcharis, the rise of the machines is not going to be their end. 

 The safai karamcharis are needed to sweep where the machines cannot go like the narrow lanes and corners. This will be accompanied by manual work. The roads will be cleaned once in three days. It is not possible to clean it daily and at the moment, it is not even done once in 10 days, said Mutreja.

 Delhis new road maintenance and repair system will include a self-propelled thermoplastic paint application and removal equipment, pumps to clean waterlogging, a high-pressure water cleaning system to wash fences, bus stands and street surfaces, a mobile maintenance unit, four patrolling vehicles and four tow-away cranes.

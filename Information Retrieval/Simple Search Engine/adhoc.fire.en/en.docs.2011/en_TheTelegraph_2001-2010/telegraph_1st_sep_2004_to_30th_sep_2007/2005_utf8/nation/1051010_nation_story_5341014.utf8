The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Freddie stamps out Becks

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 9: There are a growing number of fans who say that the captain is past his best and should step down. There are others who add that the foreign coach should be sacked as well. As matters now stand, the nation can find few reasons to be optimistic about the teams chances at the next world cup.

 As the sun sets on David Beckham, it is rising on Englands favoured new son, Andrew Flintoff, who is to have a 2006 calendar all to himself, it was announced today.

 That is on top of the four new stamps commemorating Englands Ashes win which have just been issued by Royal Mail, including one depicting Flintoff. The Poms are expected to lick these stamps on in generous quantities in the Christmas mail posted to their cousins in Australia.

 Meanwhile, Beckham compounded one of the worst weeks of my life ? his son, Romeo, has been ill ? by being sent off during the World Cup qualifier against Austria at Old Trafford in Manchester last night. England scraped through by a solitary penalty, which the England captain did not take although this is supposed to be his speciality. It was ceded to his teammate, Frank Lampard.

 So, if Beckham does not play well and or take penalty kicks and even manages to get himself sent off, should he remain captain? For that matter, ask his critics, should he even be in the team?

 There are those who argue that he shows more invention at the hairdressers than he does on the football pitch, proof of his flightiness and lack of substance, Jim Munro, football editor of the Sunday Times, noted today.

 Beckham, the Sunday Times reminded readers, was previously sent off at a critical point during the game against Argentina during the 1998 World Cup. Effigies of Beckham swung outside inner-city pubs. His friends in the media suggested he would have to leave the country.

 Last night, Beckham was sent off after the referee judged ? perhaps a trifle harshly ? that he had fouled Austrias Andreas Ibertsberger twice in as many minutes, and that, too, just outside the penalty area.

 The madness and gross irresponsibility that led to David Beckhams sending-off at such a crucial stage of this crucial World Cup qualifier should mean that it was his last act as England captain, raged the Sunday Telegraph.

 At least, Sourav Gangulys critics in India havent had a go at his hairstyle ? not yet, anyway.

 The England coach, Sven Goran Eriksson apparently did not know that Beckham, who has missed the last three penalty kicks in high pressure internationals, would this time ask Lampard to do the honours.

 You can see why people are saying the Swede does not do much to earn his handsome (? 4.5 million) salary, commented the Observer.

 Meanwhile, fortune smiles on Englands Ashes hero. Over 100,000 orders have already been taken by retailers for the ? 7.99 Flintoff calendar which is expected easily to outsell Beckhams. Flintoffs ghosted autobiography, Being Freddie, is also in the bestsellers list.

 A spokesman for Danilo, the company which produced the Flintoff calendar, said: We expect Freddies calendar debut to out-sell some of the biggest names for 2006.

 In Australia, Flintoff joked in a statement: I did have an early night the night before the shoot to try and look decent, and thankfully Danilo said no major retouching was needed.

 Although Royal Mail does not generally focus on faces of sporting personalities, those of the England captain, Michael Vaughan, Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen, can be clearly identified in the Ashes stamps. 

 Julietta Edgar, spokeswoman for Royal Mail, which has reversed Great Britains earlier reputation for producing dull stamps, said: Englands victory in the Ashes series certainly counts as a momentous occasion, making it an ideal topic for a set of Royal Mail special stamps. Im sure the public will love using these stamps every day to continue the legacy of this sporting achievement.

 Asked what would his choice for Indian cricketing stamps in similar style, former spin bowler Dilip Doshi offered his personal selection to The Telegraph: Perhaps Sachins greatness, Sehwags 300 and Kumbles 10 wickets against Pakistan. But frankly, there is not a lot to celebrate.

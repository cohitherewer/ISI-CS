 Azamgarh (Uttar Pradesh), Nov. 12: Disowned yesterday, restless for a glimpse today.

 Abu Salems mother and two brothers headed for Mumbai this morning in the hope of meeting him after news reached their Sarai Mir home that the don had been brought back to India.

 Sources close to the Salem family said Ashrafi Begum, Chunchun Miyan and Abu Jaice Ejaz left in a car this morning for Shahganj station, about 70 km from here, to board a train for Delhi. From there, they are supposed to take a flight to Mumbai.

 She would like to meet her son, said a relative who did not want to be named. I believe it is not illegal for a mother to see her son and assist him to fight his case in court.

 Yesterday, when reporters descended on the Salem familys palatial house in Sarai Mir, both the brothers, who are in the construction business, said they were not in touch with the don since 1984, though he had come for a day in 1990 when their uncle died.

 The sources, however, said that soon after the family came to know that Salem had been brought back to India, his 67-year-old mother became restless and fell ill. She wanted to meet her son. The family then quickly organised an advocate in Mumbai to handle his cases.

 They are not here. They were here yesterday. My father would probably be going to Delhi, Chunchun Miyans elder son Mohammad Arief Ansari said.

 But dont ask me, the Class VIII student added.

 In Sarai Mirs Pathanmohalla, the Salem familys three-storeyed, 20-room house overlooks an open space. The house, which stands out in a semi-urban settlement, had been built when Salem was here. It has a special air-conditioned room as the family always hoped Salem would some day return to India.

 Will Abi Bhaiya, as Salem is fondly called in Azamgarh, be brought to Sarai Mir? Police and intelligence sources pleaded ignorance.

 Salems former friends who remember him vaguely as an 18-year-old car mechanic find it difficult to reconcile themselves to his image as a don. But one neighbour, Sayed Mir, said that from his early teenage, Salem had adult friends.

 He had an instinct for adventure, he added.

 In 1982, Salem got married to a minor from a neighbouring village. He divorced her within a year. In 1984, Salem left Azamgarh.

 Azamgarh first woke up to Abi Bhaiyas don image when he was arrested by Mumbai police in the early nineties from his travel agency in Santacruz after a case was filed by his in-laws for marrying a teenager against her parents consent. He was, however, released soon.

 Between 1993 and 2000, Salem is believed to have invited a large number of people from Azamgarh to Dubai with job offers. The economy of Azamgarh depends on hawala transactions through which the families left behind by the workers who have gone to Dubai receive money, said senior superintendent of police S.K. Bhagat.

 Most of these unskilled labourers work as washermen, he added.

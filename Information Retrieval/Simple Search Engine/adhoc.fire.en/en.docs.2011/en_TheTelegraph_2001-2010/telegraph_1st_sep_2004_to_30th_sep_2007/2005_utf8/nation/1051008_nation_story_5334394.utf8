 Go-ahead to polls puzzles lawyers

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: Lawyers are baffled that the Supreme Court, while striking down the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly as unconstitutional, did not take the next logical step of stopping the polls and reviving the House.

 They are waiting for the main judgment which, the five-judge bench has said in its interim order, will spell out the reasons behind the decision.

 Earlier, in the S.R. Bommai case, a nine-judge Constitution bench had ruled that in cases of unconstitutional dissolutions (of a legislature), the Supreme Court could stay fresh elections. Then, after arguments, if it was established that the dissolution was wrong, then status quo ante could be ordered (the House could be revived).

 The nine-judge bench had made it clear that this was a remedial action the apex court could take to prevent fraud on the Constitution.

 M.N. Krishnamani, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and designated senior counsel, said: Perhaps the judges (of the five-judge bench) found reasons not to use the remedial measure suggested in the S.R. Bommai judgment and hence decided to give detailed reasons later.

 He said the five-judge bench could not overrule or go beyond the decision of the nine-member bench. However, from now on, such hasty dissolutions cannot be carried out by the Centre, he added.

 Former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, counsel for National Democratic Alliance MLAs who challenged the dissolution, echoed this. No more midnight dissolution of Assemblies would be possible, he said.

 Both Sorabjee and Krishnamani believe that the electoral process could not have been stopped once the notification had been issued, but the court, in future cases, could stay issuance of the notification by the Election Commission.

 This, both said, has been facilitated by the Bommai judgment, under which the court can even stop elections if the unconstitutionality of a dissolution is established. Till the hearings are over and the court takes a decision on the dissolution, it can order the poll panel not to announce the election schedule.

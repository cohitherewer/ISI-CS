 Norway cuts aid 

 Kathmandu, July 20: Four days after King Gyanendras government presented an aid-dependent budget, Norway today slashed its development assistance to Nepal because of suppression of democratic and civil rights, reports our correspondent.

 In a statement, the Norwegian embassy said its government considered the February 1 takeover by Gyanendra a serious setback to multiparty democracy, constitutional monarchy and human rights.

 As a result, the Government of Norway has decided to reduce the planned bilateral financial assistance for 2006 by Rs 157.33 million, the statement said. It has also decided to terminate the bilateral agreement on financial support to the Melamchi Water Supply Project with immediate effect.

 The statement quoted Norwegian ambassador Tore Toreng as saying that the country would reconsider the assistance if concrete efforts are made to restore democracy, improve the human rights situation and engage in talks to bring peace to the violence-torn land. 

 Toreng also said it has been decided not to enter into any bilateral pact with Nepal.

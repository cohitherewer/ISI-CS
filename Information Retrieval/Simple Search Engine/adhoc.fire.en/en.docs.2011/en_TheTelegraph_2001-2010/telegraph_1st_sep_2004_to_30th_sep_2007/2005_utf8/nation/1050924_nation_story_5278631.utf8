 Jaya in varsity U-turn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Jaya: Volte-face

 Chennai, Sept. 23: The Jayalalithaa government, which yesterday steamrolled the Opposition to pass a bill retaining the name of University of Madras, today did an about-turn and withdrew it.

 According to the law, the name was to have changed automatically to University of Chennai when Madras was renamed in September 1996 by the DMK government. But it had continued to be known by its old name. Recently, the authorities realised that if the university was to keep its name legally, a bill would need to be passed amending the University of Madras Act. 

 The faculty and students wanted the name Madras to stay, as it was recognised internationally. Besides, the university had entered into agreements with foreign universities under the old name. 

 Accordingly, the bill was passed. But the Opposition cried foul, accusing the government of betraying the Tamil cause.

 State education minister C.V. Shanmugham took the House by surprise today when he moved a motion saying the bill stood withdrawn.

 The DMK deputy leader, Durai Murugan, responded with a sabaash (well done) and said this was a vindication of their stand. 

 But, to the embarrassment of the DMK, Jayalalithaa revealed that the partys regime had allowed the name of Chennai Medical College and Research Institute to be restored to Madras Medical College and Research Institute. 

 The name was first changed in 1996 when the city was renamed. But later, when the institute was applying for deemed university status, it asked to be allowed to take its old name. The DMK government went along with this request, the chief minister said. Where was your concern for Tamil sentiments then? she asked the Opposition party.

 The DMK accused us of changing a Tamil name, but in this instance, we never did anything like that, Jayalalithaa added. 

 The university had only asked to be allowed to keep its original name in English and had adopted another resolution saying the name Chennai Palkalaikazhagam could be used in Tamil, she said.

 But the chief minister tried to justify todays volte-face saying the government wanted to think over the matter. While the name of University of Bombay was changed when the city was renamed Mumbai, that of University of Calcutta had remained unchanged, she said, suggesting either precedent could be followed.

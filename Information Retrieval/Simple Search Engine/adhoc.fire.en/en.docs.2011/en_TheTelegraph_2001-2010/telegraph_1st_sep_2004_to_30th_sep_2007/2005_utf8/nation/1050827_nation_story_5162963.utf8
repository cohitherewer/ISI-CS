 Garden tour for Gursharan

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Kabul, Aug. 26: Gursharan Kaur, Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs wife, will be given a privileged tour of the Bagh-e-Zanana ? the garden for women ? over the weekend. 

 Rahul Gandhi, who is a member of the Prime Ministers delegation, is expected to accompany Singh on each official engagement for his grooming in diplomatic affairs. 

 Just ahead of the visit of the Prime Ministers wife, the Indian ambassador was given a tour of the Bagh-e-Zanana. The Indian ambassador here is Rakesh Sood, definitely male. Subsequently he had the opportunity to meet President Hamid Karzai who was stunned he had made it to the Bagh. Sood explained he was invited for the tour and escorted by the minister for womens welfare, Masooda Jalal. 

 Jalal will also escort Gursharan Kaur. There is a proposal from India to re-construct the garden, where men are not allowed unless there is explicit permission, on the model of the Dilli Haat, an open-air shopping plaza-cum-socialising space in Delhi. 

 Strangely, the official schedule of the Prime Minister and his wife does not include a visit to the gurdwara by either. Singh hails from a family that had trading ties with Afghanistan, which still has about 5,000 Sikhs, down from 22,000 in the 1980s. Of the eight gurdwaras in Kabul, only one is really used.

 Not so lucky as ambassador Sood, Singh will not get to enter the Bagh-e-Zanana but only see the Bagh-e-Babur where the founder of the Mughal dynasty is buried. Babur, who died in 1530, was buried here by his wife some seven years later.

 According to his wishes, the grave is unmarked, though in later years a tomb was built. The garden, that encapsulates layers of Mughal history because it was a place of pilgrimage for the Mughal emperors Akbar and Shah Jahan as well, is being conserved by the Aga Khan Foundation for Heritage and Culture. 

 Across the Bagh-e-Babur is the huge Habibia School, which used to be targeted by the Taliban and has been reconstructed by India. Singh will inaugurate its renovated version.

 Personnel of the Special Protection Group (SPG), who are already here securing each place Singh will visit, has made the school out of bounds for unauthorised people. King Zahir Shah and Karzai are among the schools alumni. It is also the school where tales of Taliban lessons were taught: If a boy has 10 Kalashnikovs and gives away two, how many will he be left with? 

 In Wazir Akbar Khan, Kabuls diplomatic enclave, where a stone wall has guarded a vacant plot for decades, the SPG moved in today. Graffiti on the wall reads: The property belongs to the Government of India.

 In 1963, Dr S. Radhakrishnan laid the foundation stone for a new Indian embassy building here. Singh will do it again this Sunday. The SPG also moved into a 100-acre plot where India will build Afghanistans parliament.

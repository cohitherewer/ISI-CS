 Sheila to tax slums for water

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 30: The Sheila Dikshit government today approved a tariff regime to tackle the water crisis in the capital.

 The regime, which would involve a massive increase in tariff, will come into effect on April 1.

 To be hit the hardest will be the Congress?s traditional voters in the capital?s slums, unauthorised colonies and urban villages who will now have to obtain a water connection and instal a meter by June. Failing this, a penalty of Rs 10,000 will be slapped on defaulters.

 The move is being viewed as part of the recommendations of a World Bank study to enable the Delhi Jal Board, a sick public sector undertaking of the Delhi government, to recover its losses. 

 Sources said the yearly collection, which now stands at Rs 350 crore, is likely to go up to Rs 3,000 crore.

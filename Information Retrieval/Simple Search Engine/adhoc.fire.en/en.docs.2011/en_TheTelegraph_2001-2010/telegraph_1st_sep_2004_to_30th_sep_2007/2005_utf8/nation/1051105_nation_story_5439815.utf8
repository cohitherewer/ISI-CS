 Patients in dark, gamma knives lie idle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: Three hospitals in India have equipped themselves with gamma knife facilities for brain tumour surgery, but they remain vastly underutilised, senior neurosurgeons have said.

 The gamma knife is a computer-aided device that uses multiple beams of radiation to destroy tumours in the head and can function as a bloodless alternative to relatively traumatic open brain surgery.

 Two hospitals in New Delhi and one in Mumbai have had gamma knife facilities for nearly eight years. But the number of patients who get treated with the gamma knife remains small because patients as well as doctors remain unaware of its benefits, according to neurosurgeons at the annual conference of the Indian societies of paediatric and stereotactic neurosurgery that opened here today.

 A gamma knife can be used only when the tumour size is less than 3 cm. But a large proportion of patients who seek treatment have much larger tumours, neurosurgeon Varindera Singh, the organising secretary of the conference said. A gamma knife facility could easily handle one patient a day, but we use it on at the most ten patients a month.

 Most tumours grow over a period of time and, in some cases, there will be a window of opportunity to avoid conventional neurosurgery, Singh said.

 The gamma knife uses 201 beams of radiation focused on the target site in the brain. Each individual beam by itself poses no harm to normal brain tissue, but the intensity of radiation at the focal point is high enough to destroy the tumour.

 The technique may be useful in the treatment of benign tumours such as meningiomas, pituitary gland tumours and acoustic nerve tumours and deep-seated abnormalities of blood vessels within the brain. The gamma knife equipment is expensive and only three hospitals have invested in it. 

 When the existing facilities are underutilised, others are hesitant to bring more such machines, Singh said.

 Treatment through a gamma knife involves local anaesthesia and the patient may be discharged within a day. In contrast, patients who have undergone the conventional neurosurgery would typically stay in hospital for about a week.

 Neurosurgeons at the conference also said India had a dearth of specialists in paediatric neurosurgery. Children account for about 25 per cent of patients who require neurosurgery but there are long waiting lists because of lack of supersuper-specialists, said Ashok Mahapatra, a neurosurgeon at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

 Early diagnosis requires greater awareness among the public. Persistent headaches with symptoms such as vomiting or visual problems that progressively get worse over months should lead to suspicion about neurological problems, Mahapatra said.

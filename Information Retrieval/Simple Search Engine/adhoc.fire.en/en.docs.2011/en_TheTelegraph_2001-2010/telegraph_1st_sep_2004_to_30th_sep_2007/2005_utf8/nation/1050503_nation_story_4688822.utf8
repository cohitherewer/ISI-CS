 Women call for IAF sex abuse cell

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 May 2: The National Commission for Women today demanded that the Indian Air Force set up a permanent cell to deal with sexual harassment as it welcomed the inclusion of two women in the court of inquiry that started probing charges levelled by Flying Officer Anjali Gupta.

 ?We had been demanding that women be included in the court of inquiry and today the air force informed us that two women have been included in the four-member committee,? the chairperson of the commission, Girija Vyas, said.

 ?They should now set up a permanent cell to take care of such grievances,? Vyas said.

 A court of inquiry headed by Air Vice-Marshal V.M. Iyer, a group captain and two women squadron leaders, examined documents ? related to the charges of sexual harassment levelled by Gupta against three superior officers ? at the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment campus, a stone?s throw from where the general court martial against her was going on.

 At the court martial against Gupta, the flying officer retched a couple of times and was advised medical examination by the presiding officer. The court martial was then adjourned for a day.

 Earlier, the prosecution ? represented by Wing Commander R.D. Dubey ? said the flying officer was at fault for drawing Rs 1,080 as road mileage allowance for a car though she had used a two-wheeler. 

 ?Why did she give the scooter number while projecting it as a car?? asked Dubey.

 The prosecution said the charges against Gupta were neither silly nor trivial. The charge of conduct unbecoming of an officer ? Gupta had thrown the breakfast of a group captain on the floor ? could lead to imprisonment of up to 14 years, he pointed out.

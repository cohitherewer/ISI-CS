 Italian climber killed in blizzard

 Dehra dun (PTI): An Italian climber was 

 killed in inclement weather while scaling the Nanda Devi 

 summit in Uttaranchal.

 Team leader Dalla Longa Marco, 45, who was reported missing in a snowstorm on Monday, died of asphyxiation, while 10 of his team were rescued by defence helicopters, a report from Pithorgarh district said.

 Heavy snowfall and blizzard in the region have forced the team to abandon its plan to scale the peak and its members are taking Marcos body to New Delhi, it said.

 A porter accompanying a group of German and Austrian climbers to Kalindi mountain near the Indo-Tibetan border, too, died because of harsh weather conditions and the team had to give up the attempt following heavy snowfall coupled with high-velocity winds.

 Altogether 30 mountaineers from various countries are now returning to Uttarkashi, police said.

 Authorities had earlier this week issued an alert to all expeditions in the region early after several mountaineers were caught in the heavy snowfall and blizzards. 

 Tihar jail officials suspended

 New Delhi: Fifteen officials of Tihar 

 jail, including three deputy superintendents, were dismissed 

 on Wednesday after being caught on camera accepting bribes 

 to supply banned items to prisoners, reports our correspondent.

 The home department of the Delhi government ordered that the officials be dismissed after an inquiry proved their guilt, a jail spokesman said.

 A private television channel had recently aired the footage showing Tihar jail officials, including an assistant superintendent, three head wardens and six wardens, purportedly accepting bribes.

 They had been immediately suspended. 

 Coke plant

 Chennai (PTI): Tamil Nadu chief minister 

 Jayalalithaa has told the Assembly that the government would 

 not allow Coca-Cola, which is setting up a bottling plant 

 in Ganganikondan village of Tirunelveli district, to exploit 

 groundwater. 

 She said the land was given to the company on the condition that it would only use water supplied by the Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board.

 Fraud banker 

 Bangalore (PTI): The vice-president of 

 Viniv Inc Foundation, a non-banking finance firm accused 

 of duping about 17,000 investors in a money-doubling scheme, 

 has been arrested and Rs 2 crore seized from him. A team 

 of Bangalore police nabbed Lokesh from Guwahati, where he 

 had been hiding.

 Tap theft

 New Delhi (PTI): Burglars walked off 

 with over a dozen taps on Tuesday night from the Jammu and 

 Kashmir House in Kotla lane, which used to be the residence 

 of chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed. Residents noticed 

 water gushing out of the compound on Wednesday morning. 

 As part of the wildlife week, the Wildlife Conservation Society will show the film Tigers ? Fighting Back and host a session with leading wildlife biologist Ulhas Karanth in Bangalore.

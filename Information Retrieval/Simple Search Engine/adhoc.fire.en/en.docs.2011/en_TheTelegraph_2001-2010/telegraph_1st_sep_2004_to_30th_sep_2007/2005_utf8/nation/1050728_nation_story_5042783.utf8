 Pranab clears air on US deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 27: India and the US can collaborate in multinational operations when it is in their common interest, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a statement in Parliament today.

 There was no proposal to deploy Indian troops, Mukherjee added.

 The new framework for the US-India Defence Relationship signed on June 28, 2005, includes provisions for co-production of defence equipment and collaboration in multinational operations when it is in their common interest, Mukherjee said in an answer to a written question from A. Vijayaraghavan.

 Asked if the agreement obliges India to deploy troops under US command, Mukherjee replied that no such participation is contemplated or implied in the arrangement.

 In answer to another question, Mukherjee said: Participation in any operation will be guided by the national interest and principles of our foreign policies, including our independent stand on international issues.

 The agreement was signed during the defence ministers visit to Washington last month. 

 It has come in for criticism from the Left.

 In his statement today, Mukherjee said: The framework provides for increased opportunities for two-way defence trade and transactions, including technology transfer, collaboration, co-production, research and development and the setting up (of) a defence procurement and production group under the US-India Defence Policy Group (DPG) to advance these objectives. Together with progress on the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP), the framework is expected to open the way for the supply of advanced technologies, including defence technologies, to India.

 But Mukherjee said that the framework will make the US one of the sources of defence equipment of supplies and increase Indias options and bargaining power in the acquisition of defence technology and equipment.

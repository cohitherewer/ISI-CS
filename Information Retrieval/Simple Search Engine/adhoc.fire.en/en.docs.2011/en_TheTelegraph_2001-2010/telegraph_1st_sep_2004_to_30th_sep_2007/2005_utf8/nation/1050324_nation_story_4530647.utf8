 Ash spices up Oakland

 Oakland, March 23 (AP): Aishwarya Rai was in downtown Oakland filming scenes for her new film, Mistress of Spices, about a shopowner trained in the art of healing with spices.

 ?It?s kind of like an ode to the Bay area,? Aishwarya (in picture) said of the film, which is based on a novel by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni.

 The filmmakers spent Sunday shooting joggers and murals around Lake Merritt for background scenes.

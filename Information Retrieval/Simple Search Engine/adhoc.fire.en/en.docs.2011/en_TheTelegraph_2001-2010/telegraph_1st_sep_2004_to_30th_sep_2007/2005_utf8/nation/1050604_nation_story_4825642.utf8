 Corporator shot in J amp;K 

 Srinagar, June 3: Militants today shot dead municipal corporator Mohammad Ashraf Bala as he was walking down a downtown Srinagar street, reports our correspondent.

 Appearing out of nowhere, they pumped a volley of automatic fire into the National Conference corporators chest before vanishing into the maze of streets.

 Bala represents the Chinkran Mohalla ward in downtown Srinagar. Only three days ago, the Jammu and Kashmir cabinet had decided on devolution of power to municipal councillors and corporators.

 He died instantly, a police officer said. Bala received several serious bullet wounds in his chest and before police could shift him to hospital, he succumbed.

 No group has claimed responsibility for the killing. Security forces and police launched a hunt for the suspects, but no one has been arrested.

 Over a dozen corporators have been killed after their election in the mid-February civic elections. They have been saying they should be provided more than a guard each.

 Due to the sheer number of councillors, it is not possible to provide them more security. Each councillor has been given one guard, another police officer said.

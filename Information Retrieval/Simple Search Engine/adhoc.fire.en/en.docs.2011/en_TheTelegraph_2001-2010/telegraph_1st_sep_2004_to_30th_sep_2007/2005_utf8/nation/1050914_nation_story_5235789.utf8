 Chicken tikkas in Swiss stores

 Kings Kurry in Zurich

 Brussels, Sept. 13 (INEP): Lovers of Indian cuisine in Switzerland can now buy their favourite dishes at their local supermarket, thanks to the entrepreneurial skills of a Zurich-based young businessman of Indian origin. 

 Ranjeet Guptara, 26, founder and chairman of Kings Kurry AG, a leading Indian cuisine specialist in Switzerland entered into partnership last week with Migros, the leading Swiss supermarket chain, to launch the first range of ready-to-warm-and-eat Indian food dishes. 

 Indian food is rapidly becoming popular across Switzerland because of the delicious variety of flavours, the fine use of spices and the positive benefits for health, Guptara said in a telephone interview from Zurich. 

 The range, called India, starts with favourite dishes such as chicken tikka masala and mild lamb korma, before going on to more adventurous dishes such as Mysore chicken and vegetable biryani, accompanied by specially created drinks such as mango lassi. 

 Officially launched last week, the new range is already available on the shelves of some 400 Migros outlets throughout the country. The dishes sell at reasonable and affordable prices between 5.50 Swiss francs (Rs 200) and 6.90 Swiss francs (Rs 250). 

 Migross food scientists impressed us with their dedication and concern to get every detail right. The Swiss bring the same precision to whatever they do: whether it is making clocks, making chocolate, or cooking curry, said Guptara. 

 Despite the fact that Switzerland is home to only a small Indian community of about 10,000, explained Guptara, Indian food is much in demand. 

 Ninety per cent of our clients are local people, and they are ready to pay 50 to 100 euros (Rs 2,700 to Rs 5,400) to enjoy authentic Indian cuisine. 

 Moreover, he said, there are very few good Indian restaurants in the country, about 40 against over 1,000 McDonalds. 

 Asked about plans for his business, the young entrepreneur said that one of his dreams is to build a chain of Indian restaurants across Europe. 

 The first objective, however, he pointed out, is to saturate the city of Zurich and surrounding areas with the chain and then consider further expansion in neighbouring countries ? France, Germany and Italy.

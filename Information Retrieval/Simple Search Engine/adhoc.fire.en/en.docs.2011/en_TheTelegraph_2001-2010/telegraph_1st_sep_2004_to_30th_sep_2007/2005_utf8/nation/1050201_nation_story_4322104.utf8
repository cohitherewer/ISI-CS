 Singh promises the moon, all in Sonia?s name

 Gandhi Maidan (Ambala), Jan. 31: Amid a rousing welcome of ?desh ka neta kaisa ho, Sonia-Manmohan jaisa ho?, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today urged the people of Haryana to free the state from the ?corrupt clutches? of the Om Prakash Chautala-led government.

 Although Singh refrained from making any personal reference to Chautala or his Indian National Lok Dal, he said the state government is inefficient and corrupt. Haryana goes to polls on Thursday.

 ?If you desire development and an end to widespread corruption that is being witnessed in Haryana now, then vote for the party which is ruling at the Centre. Only a party that has power in the state as well as the Centre can pull Haryana out of the abyss?. If you want Haryana to become the No. 1 state in the country again, then vote for the Congress. It is in your interest,? he said to loud cheers from a modest but vocal crowd of 10,000.

 Haryana is the first stop for Singh, who is scheduled to campaign in all the three states going to polls next month.

 He said the UPA is determined to give a better deal to farmers, the majority in the state. ?Haryana mein nayi kranti laane ki zaroorat hai. Aur woh kranti Soniaji samajhti hain. Congress ko vote do aur Soniaji ka haath majboot karo. Soniaji ka haath majboot hoga to mera haath bhi majboot hoga. (Haryana needs a new revolution that Sonia understands. Vote for the Congress and strengthen Sonia?s hands. By strengthening her hands, you will be strengthening mine).?

 The Prime Minister promised jobs for ?every? hand. ?Hamara laqshya hai berozgaari aur bekari se chhutkaraa dilana (Our aim is to free people from unemployment).? 

 Singh described the Congress as the only party that believes in the welfare of all communities. ?Congress prem, tapasya, tyag aur seva mein vishwaas rakhti hai (The Congress believes in love, meditation, sacrifice and service).? 

 He pointed out that the government has been working hard to redress the grievances of farmers, evolving schemes for their benefit. ?From proper seeds to easy availability of loans with low interests and affordable power tariffs and cheap power supply, we are trying to usher in an era of development unheard of in the community. But everything will take time. Strengthen our hands by bringing us to power in Haryana. I can assure you that by doing so your arms will, too, become strong.?

 Lambasting the Chautala government, the Prime Minster said it has made every section unhappy. ?The centres of excellence in Haryana have been handed over to vice-chancellors who know nothing about education. They are playing with the future of the youths. 

 ?The quality of education and health services has deteriorated to abysmal levels. Law and order has collapsed. The government needs to be changed,? he said as he expressed confidence that the Congress would ride back to power with a thumping majority.

 Bhajan Lal booed

 Infighting in the Haryana Congress came to the fore when state party chief Bhajan Lal was hooted down as he rose to speak before Singh at the rally.

 ?Koi baat nahin,? he said, but the shouting continued and Congress workers waved the party flag, signalling him to stop.

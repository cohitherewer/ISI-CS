 Push to pure science

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 15: The human resource development ministry has asked universities to fill up the large number of faculty positions in pure science disciplines lying vacant for a long time.

 The directive came after a task force set up by the ministry urged the universities to plug loopholes in the system which are hurting research in pure science. The committee of experts suggested a string of reforms to make the Indian system on a par with international standards.

 The quality and quantum of scientific research have been declining over the years due to inadequate infrastructure, insufficient funding of research and lack of committed workforce, said the task force. 

 It reminded the government that the problem has actually assumed serious proportions and requires radical measures at the highest policy level.

 The report said enrolment in basic sciences has declined. There is an acute shortage of quality teachers in basic sciences, engineering, technology and medicine. 

 The experts asked universities to make research in science a key activity. 

 Access to scientific research journals and related resources must be strengthened and its scope should be widened through information and communication technology.

 According to experts, universities need to create at least 1,000 posts at the level of lecturers, readers and professors for research scientists. 

 Their performance should be reviewed every five years by an expert committee, the task force said.

 The eligibility criterion for a lecturer, according to the task force, should be a PhD. However, in the departments of engineering and medicine, a lecturer may be appointed with MTech, MD or MS qualifications. They will have to finish their PhD within a seven-year period.

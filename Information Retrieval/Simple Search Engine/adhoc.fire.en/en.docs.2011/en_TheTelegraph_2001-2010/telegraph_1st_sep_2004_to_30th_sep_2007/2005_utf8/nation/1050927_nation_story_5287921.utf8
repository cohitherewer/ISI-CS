 Jewels spill out of Birla safes

 Priyamvada Birla

 Calcutta, Sept. 26: Diamonds, rubies and emeralds in 30 velvet boxes.

 After antique coins dating back to the Gupta, Maurya and Mughal periods, the court-appointed special officers have found jewellery and precious stones from two safes at Birla Park, the residential address of the countrys first business family on Gurusaday Dutt Road.

 The four-member team, instructed by Calcutta High Court to make an inventory of assets in the late Priyamvada Birlas estate, found diamonds, rubies, emeralds and other precious stones besides jewellery last Friday.

 The officers ? Pradip Ghosh, Ahin Chowdhury, I.P. Mukherjee and A.K. Banerjee ? opened the safes in the presence of representatives of chartered accountant Rajendra Singh Lodha and the Birla family. The two sides are engaged in a bitter legal battle over the assets of the MP Birla group which, according to Lodha, were bequeathed to him by Priyamvada Birla.

 The first safe was opened using combination locks. But as there were no keys to open the second safe, a gas cutter was brought in and it took more than two-and-a-half hours to break it open. 

 Some gold ornaments and a book was found in the chest. A list containing particulars of jewellery was found in the book, which also had details of how to open the second safe, said a source. 

 When they opened the second safe, the special officers found valuable stones, gems, pearls and ornaments stashed in 30 velvet boxes. 

 Some of the diamonds were really big, said a source, hinting that the value of the treasure hunt is swelling with every session of the inventory-making exercise.

 Apparently, the special officers have found another safe at the toilet attached to Priyamvada Birlas bedroom. It will be opened sometime next week, the source said.

 Late last month, the special officers had found more than 300 antique coins and gold artefacts, including tea sets and flower vases, from an almirah. Three pistols were also found in the almirah. Eight armed guards were later deployed at the house.

 The special officers are yet to make a full inventory of the belongings at Priyamvada Birlas properties in Mumbai and Delhi. The inventory is almost complete in Allahabad.

 CD cloud on Laloo attack

 ALOKE TIKKU

 Nawal Kishore Sharma

 New Delhi, April 26: The developments following the alleged attack on railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav in Vadodara could have been different if Gujarat governor Nawal Kishore Sharma had waited another day before sending his report to the Union home ministry.

 Shortly after he sent his report on Saturday, some Congress leaders gave the governor a set of CDs, which could have raised questions on the Gujarat government?s claim that the rear windshield of the railway minister?s car was not broken when he was leaving the Vadodara hospital. The precise contents of the CDs, though, are not known.

 Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi?s report said only a water pouch was thrown at Laloo Prasad?s car, as opposed to the RJD leader?s claim that his car was stoned.

 But since the governor had already submitted his report ? primarily based on information provided by the state government ? he decided against sending a fresh report but made it a point to clarify the issue with home minister Shivraj Patil at his meeting this afternoon.

 It is, however, too late for the home minister to do anything. In the absence of a strong report from the governor that indicts the state government, the UPA regime took a last-minute decision yesterday not to field Patil but Laloo Prasad in Parliament.

 By doing this, the Congress not only distanced itself from the attack, which many in the party believe was blown out of proportion by the RJD chief, but also ensured that the government did not restrict itself to the reports received from the state and the governor.

 Had Patil been told to speak in Parliament yesterday, he would have had to base his statement on the reports received from Gujarat. Laloo Prasad, on the other hand, had no such compulsion and spoke on the basis of his personal experience. 

 He, too, was a trifle defensive for he did not mention any stones being pelted at him. He said water bottles and pieces of ice were thrown when he visited the Vadodara hospital after the Sabarmati Express accident on April 21. Stones, the minister told Parliament, were directed at the railway officials accompanying him.

 Officials said the home ministry intended to close the attack chapter with a general advisory to states, reminding them that it was the responsibility of the governments there to provide adequate security to visiting central ministers.

 Regarding the state police?s contention that they were not given advance notice, officials said instructions will be issued to security agencies to keep the states posted on the movement of VVIPs.

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: Mulayam Singh Yadav?s friends and foes alike are warming up to take a shy at his crown.

 Rivals BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party, as well as outside supporter Congress, are honing strategies for the kill, with Allahabad High Court due to shortly hear a petition seeking disqualification of the 40 BSP MLAs who defected to the Mulayam Singh camp 16 months ago.

 All three parties have announced separate programmes to push for the ouster of the Mulayam Singh government which might be reduced to a minority if the MLAs are disqualified under the anti-defection law.

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will lead the BJP campaign, which will begin after the Bihar and Jharkhand polls. ?There is no question of standing with those who are throwing the state into a state of chaos and anarchy. Uttar Pradesh is a fit case for President?s rule,? he said in Farrukabad today.

 The Congress should decide once and for all which way it wants to go, BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.

 Rahul Gandhi, who has been camping in Amethi since Tuesday, said the Congress should avoid compromises if it wanted to regain power in the state. ?My personal view is any compromise should be avoided if the Congress has to regain its position in Uttar Pradesh even if it means staying away from power for some more time,? he said.

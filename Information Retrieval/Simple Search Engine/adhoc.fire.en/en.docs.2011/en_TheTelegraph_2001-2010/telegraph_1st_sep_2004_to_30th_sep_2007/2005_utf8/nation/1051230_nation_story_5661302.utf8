 Bihar hotshot in exam net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 29: The Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC), which regularly courted controversy during the Rashtriya Janata Dals rule in the state, was back in the news today when vigilance sleuths arrested its chairman, two members and six other employees for an alleged government examination fraud.

 The nine, now remanded in judicial custody, had reportedly used the states recruitment agency to promote ineligible candidates. 

 They had also applied wrong means in the process, initiated through a limited competitive test conducted in 2003, for upgrading government servants as deputy collectors of the Bihar Administrative Service.

 The arrested include BPSC chief Ram Singhasan Singh, members Shiv Balak Chaudhary and Syed Masoom Ali, a section officer, a routine clerk, an information officer, two programmers and an assistant secretary.

 The controversy surfaced after the results of the examination ? for the promotion of 184 candidates ? were announced in May this year. Some of the hopefuls moved Patna High Court challenging the results. They also alleged that answerscripts of the test had been bungled. The government ordered a vigilance probe.

 They candidates pleaded before the court that the test be cancelled and fresh examinations held since locks of the room where the answersheets were kept had been broken. The high court first sought a report from the BPSC.

 The vigilance bureau, meanwhile, reported to the court that the BPSC authorities were not cooperating. In its fresh order earlier this month, the bench of Justice S.K. Katariyar asked the vigilance department to conduct searches at the BPSC office.

 The court also directed the BPSC to show the answerscripts to the vigilance officers, but the agency sought a stay on this order. During the course of the hearing, the petitioners lawyer produced answerscripts before the court, giving strength to the charge of bungling.

 In raids conducted at the BPSC premises, the vigilance sleuths seized answerbooks along with other incriminating documents. 

 Bureau sources said a study of the papers seized prepared the ground for todays action against the BPSC chief and eight others.

 Ram Singhasan Singh had been handpicked to head the public service commission by RJD president Lalu Prasad. His predecessors, Laxmi Yadav and Ramashray Prasad Yadav, both believed to be close to Lalu Prasad, also had turbulent tenures.

 Neelmani, additional director-general of the vigilance bureau, said: We have sufficient evidence against those arrested today. Documents are still being scrutinised.

 The high court has directed the bureau to submit its report of progress on the matter in a sealed cover on January 3.

 The high-profile arrests came a day before President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams visit to the state. The timing is good. The President is to attend convocations of two universities ? Patna and Mithila ? in Bihar. The rot in the BPSC is indicative of the general academic mess that has plagued Bihar, said a retired professor of Patna University. 

 The promotiontests were held for the first time in 2003. Before that, promotions to gazetted posts were made on the basis of internal selection, but the government later decided to conduct competitive examinations for the purpose.

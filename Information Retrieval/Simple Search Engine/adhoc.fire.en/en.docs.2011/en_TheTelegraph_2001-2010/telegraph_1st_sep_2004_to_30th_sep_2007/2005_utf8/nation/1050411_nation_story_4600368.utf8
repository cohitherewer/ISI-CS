 Law ministry tars defence

 Calcutta, April 10: The Union law minister today said the defence ministry had changed the draft affidavit it submitted in the Supreme Court in the Kargil defence procurement case.

 The affidavit has been in the news after it was considered to be indirectly exonerating George Fernandes, who was the defence minister during the Kargil war. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today denied giving any clean chit to Fernandes.

 Law minister H.R. Bhardwaj told a television channel: ?We had drafted our affidavit and sent it to the defence ministry through the attorney-general. There, it was changed before it was filed in court.?

 ?The attorney-general was very displeased and has written to the defence secretary expressing his displeasure,? he added.

 Mukherjee clarified the reported clean chit at a news conference at the PCC office here. ?The inference which is sought to be drawn that a clean chit has been given to George Fernandes is unjustified and unwarranted.?

 Left leaders had earlier told the Prime Minister that the government had ?messed up? the Kargil coffin purchase case ? part of the defence procurement ? and should take corrective measures.

 On April 8, Mukherjee told the Left leaders that the government would file a supplementary affidavit in the Supreme Court in the Kargil coffin case. Bharadwaj said the same day that ?facts missing? from the earlier affidavit will be included in it.

 ?We are filing the supplementary affidavit before the court to clarify a number of points. However, as defence minister, I take full responsibility of the affidavit filed before the court,? Mukherjee said this afternoon.

 Bhardwaj said a plan had been formulated that if the defence ministry did not file it, the law ministry would.

 The government had earlier told the Supreme Court in response to a public interest litigation that the military purchases made during the 1999 Kargil war were above board, thereby indirectly exonerating Fernandes.

 Mukherjee, however, said: ?There is no question of giving a clean chit to any person, much less George Fernandes. The affidavit does not even refer to or mention any person.? 

 Fernandes, however, found words of encouragement from Justice S.. Phukan, who probed the Tehelka sting operation into defence deals. ?I only gave a report containing 600 pages regarding past defence transactions. So far as I remember, I did not find anything against George,? he told a television channel.

 Mukherjee said his ministry filed an affidavit in which it was clarified that the modified procedures were not in violation of the financial rules of the government or the defence procurement procedures of 1992.

 ?It was alleged that the procedures laid down for procurement were not followed while procuring arms, weapons and equipment.

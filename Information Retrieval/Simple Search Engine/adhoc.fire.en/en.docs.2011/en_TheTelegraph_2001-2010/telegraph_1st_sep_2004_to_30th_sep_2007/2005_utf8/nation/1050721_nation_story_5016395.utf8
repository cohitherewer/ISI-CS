 Pak keeps out Bollywood

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Meera: No comments

 Islamabad, July 20: The Musharrafs date with Rani Mukherjee has not inspired Pakistan to open its arms to Bollywood.

 The culture secretary, Jalil Abbas, said here today that Islamabad has no plans of lifting the ban on screening of Hindi films in the country. 

 Yes, we have better relations now but we have to look at various factors while taking the decision, Abbas said, without giving details. 

 The peace initiative by the neighbours had raised the hopes of Pakistani cinema owners and film distributors who are looking to the hugely popular Hindi films for survival. 

 The number of cinemas has declined from 2,000 in the late 1970s to 150 now after then military ruler Zia-ul Haq introduced some Islamic laws that affected film productions. 

 Despite many ups and downs in bilateral relations, including the Kargil conflict, Indian films have remained a big hit with Pakistanis who watch them on pirated videos at home. Cinema owners were hoping to tap this audience if the ban on import of Indian films were lifted.

 They would have been happy to see President Musharraf and wife Sehba meeting actor Rani Mukherjee at a dinner hosted by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during their visit to Delhi in April.

 But the bureaucracy and film producers are against lifting the ban and argue that it would hit the local film industry. 

 If we allow the import of Indian films, that means we kill the industry once and for all, a senior official said.

 The ban will stay, but the exchange between Bollywood and Lollywood, as Pakistans film industry is nicknamed, continues. 

 Not only are Pakistani stars like Zeba Bakhtiar and now Meera acting in Indian films, some local filmmakers like Shehzad Gul, scion of the Gul family that pioneered filmmaking in the country after its creation in 1947, have begun hiring Indian music directors and vocalists for their films.

 Meera case

 Meera, the star of Mahesh Bhatts Nazar, is in trouble for allegedly sending hitmen to beat up a media photographer, adds PTI. A case has been registered against Meera and her mother Shafqat Zohra in Lahore.

 Police officials, quoting the FIR, said S.A. Raza was on his way home on his motorcycle when a car hit him from behind. 

 As the photographer fell off his bike, five armed men came out of the car and started beating him up. They told him he was being punished for printing bad things about Meera. If you go to the authorities, it will be even worse for you, he was allegedly told. Raza is in hospital with head injury and a fractured arm.

 Meera said she had no idea what was going on and had nothing to say about it.

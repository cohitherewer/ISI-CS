 Killer woman let off by court

 Tiruchirapalli (PTI): A district sessions 

 court has acquitted a woman who stabbed to death a man in 

 self-defence and to protect her child.

 The court said the accused had offered a consistent defence ? that she was compelled to attack the deceased only to protect herself and her child. The woman had only tried to use the knife in her hand as an armour, but unfortunately it turned out to be a weapon.

 The judge said the place of occurrence itself was enough to prove that she had no choice but to attack. The injury inflicted by her also proved that it was in self-defence. The woman had also surrendered to police.

 Chandru, a broker, had demanded from her a commission from the sale of a beauty parlour though he had no role in the deal. She had refused, the defence said.

 He had intruded into her house in October 2004 with a knife and threatened to kill her child. 

 Hospital death damage order

 New Delhi (PTI): A consumer court has 

 ordered Delhis St Stephens Hospital to pay a 

 compensation of Rs 1 lakh to a Delhi Doordarshan staffer 

 whose mother died from an over-exposure to laser rays at 

 the hospital. 

 Complainant Masood Zafar had admitted his mother, Hazara Zafar Begum, to the hospital in January 2000 after she complained of severe headache and vomiting. 

 As she developed an acute abdominal pain, the hospital authorities, suspecting gall bladder stone, conducted a laser test. The pain turned severe within a few days and she developed a breathing problem. 

 The doctors at the hospital finally admitted that excess use of laser had injured her stomach ducts, causing formation of puss and severe pancreatitis. 

 Hazara Begum died in March 2000.

 bill on reservations for SCs and STs in private educational

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Stage set for shuffle 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 3: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to shuffle his cabinet next week.

 Singh, who is believed to have discussed his plans with Sonia Gandhi, might drop a few ministers, change the portfolio of several others and induct some new faces from the Congress.

 According to Congress sources, the first major shuffle since Singh constituted his UPA ministry on May 22, 2004 will probably take place on June 9, after President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam returns from his four-nation visit.

 Singh and Sonia, the UPA chairperson, have apparently focused on the need to improve the performance of infrastructure ministries. The Congress holds some of them like power, while others like telecom and road transport have allies at the helm. The party leadership is reportedly exploring whether it can get some of the infrastructure portfolios from its allies.

 Congress circles do not expect big changes at the crust ?finance, defence, home and external affairs ? as Sonia is believed to prefer a stable arrangement in the top rung. 

 However, there is speculation that defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister Shivraj Patil may swap offices. The shuffle buzz has made several middle- and junior-level Congress ministers anxious.

 Jagdish Tytler, Oscar Fernandes and Kapil Sibal hope to get better portfolios. 

 In contrast, Sis Ram Ola and P.M. Sayeed, who are believed to be on the hit list, are scared of losing their berths. Junior ministers such as Renuka Choudhury, Rao Inderjit Singh, Subodh Kant Sahay, E.V.K.S. Elangovan and Vilas Muttemwar are also said to be part of this list.

 Ministers with two portfolios like Mani Shankar Aiyar, Jaipal Reddy and Ghulam Nabi Azad are apprehensive as they do not know which ministry they would lose. Aiyar holds petroleum and panchayati raj, Reddy information and broadcasting as well as culture and Azad urban development and parliamentary affairs.

 The list of hopefuls also includes Congress general secretary Ambika Soni, whose name is being mentioned for Reddys information and broadcasting portfolio.

 Former Kerala chief minister A.K. Antony, who entered the Rajya Sabha only a few days ago, is expected to make it to the cabinet as his states representative. Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma expects to be Himachal Pradeshs face in the ministry. 

 GeNext MPs, too, can expect good news. 

 There are two vacancies from the Congress quota ? one because of Sunil Dutts death and the other due to the election of K. Rehman Khan as Rajya Sabha deputy chairman last year.

 Wife guides rebel to life

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jammu, Jan. 13: In the first case of its kind, 

a militant of the Harkat-ul Mujahideen, Mohammad Yaqoob, surrendered in Jammu 

at the behest of his wife.

 Fatima, who married Yaqoob a year ago, accompanied her husband when he laid down arms yesterday at Chakslalta before police and the 54 Rashtriya Rifles.

 Yaqoob, 22, had taken up arms at the age of 17, according to the deputy inspector-general of Doda-Udhampur range, Satvir Gupta.

 The rebel said his decision to surrender was prompted by Fatima repeatedly telling him about the ?curse of militancy? and its ?ill effects on their family and the yet-to-be-born child?. ?I was convinced because I had no answer to her queries about the life on the run that militancy brings,? he said.

 Yaqoob and his wife belong to farmers? families of Gandoh in Doda district and the two were married with the blessings of their relatives and without any coercion.

 However, Fatima said she had been uneasy with being the wife of a militant as the life of a rebel was filled with uncertainties and she wanted stability for them and their would-be children. ?Today, I am relieved,? she said after her husband surrendered.

 ?This is what we hope would turn into a trend,? said Gupta. The officer, who has served in various places, including Kashmir, in the past 15 years, said the surrender is ?the first case of its kind?.

 Of late, the authorities have been highlighting the insecurity in the life of a militant and urging their family members to prevail upon them to surrender. The contrasts between constantly being hunted and a settled life with financial support of Rs 1.5 lakh and a Rs 2,000 monthly stipend are also used to motivate rebels to lay down arms.

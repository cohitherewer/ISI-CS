 Lost as toddler, back as 12-year-old

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Jan. 5: A 12-year-old boy was ?reunited? today with his mother 10 years after he was kidnapped from his village.

 Gagandeep Singh was abducted in 1995 from Lohara village in Muktsar when he was two-and-a-half-years old.

 ?The boy has very faint memories of who kidnapped him. But he remembers his parents, his house,? Muktsar senior superintendent of police L.K. Yadav said over telephone.

 ?We will have a DNA test conducted for foolproof conclusion that Gagandeep?s mother is actually his as he claims,? he added.

 Gagandeep was rescued by a social organisation, Suraksha Helpline, when he refused to acknowledge as his father the person who brought him to the Bathinda civil hospital last month with a fractured arm.

 He had broken his arm at a dhaba where he was working. ?I told the doctors that (Dar Vijay) Pandey was not my father. Then some people came asking about me and brought others along who claimed to be my mother and father. I knew they were trying to take me away,? Gagandeep said.

 But his mother, Satinder, had seen his photograph published in a daily and recognised him by the marks on his face. His father, Pritam, had died a couple of years after the abduction following a brief illness.

 ?It was a strange feeling when I saw my mother who had come to see whether I was the same Gagandeep or not. I can?t explain what I felt when I saw her and recognised her immediately,? the boy said.

 Gagandeep, however, cannot remember all the way back to his abduction. ?I can only remember from 1998 onwards when I was in Rajasthan. I used to wash dishes in hotels, help make parathas at a roadside stall and roam the countryside as a shepherd.?

 On August 11, 2000, Gagandeep was found loitering around and handed over to Manniram of Bopalaram village, Rajasthan, by the Loon Karanser station house officer.

 Manniram did not have any children and taught Gagandeep to be a shepherd. The boy fled in fear of a thrashing from Manniram after a dog mauled a sheep to death.

 Gagandeep went to a dhaba in Loon Karanser where he met Jalaluddin, who produced him in court. In the court, Pandey of Uttar Pradesh claimed the boy to be his missing son and got his custody in August 2003.

 Pandey got him a job in a Bathinda dhaba. ?He used to beat me and harass me. The sons of my employer used to tell me I was not Pandey?s son,? Gagandeep said.

 Police official Yadav said: ?We worked hard on the boy. He was frightened in the beginning but began to talk when he was convinced we were going to help him find his parents.?

 The abduction file was closed in 1997, the officer said, but ?we are trying to trace his kidnappers?. ?We have one suspect whom Gagandeep?s father had named.?

 Muktsar police had sent teams to Rajasthan to verify Gagandeep?s claims. ?Apart from the DNA test, we have verified his movements. It was only after feeling convinced that his story was true that we handed Gagandeep to his mother,? Yadav said.

 Satinder is in a happy daze but feels her worst is not over as the DNA test is left. ?His father used to tell me that he will return,? she said.

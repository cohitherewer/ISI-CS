 Modi to stay

 New Delhi, March 31: The BJP high command has decided not to replace Narendra Modi as Gujarat chief minister for the time being despite the rebels, including two former chief ministers, demanding his scalp, reports our special correspondent.

 Among the key factors that tilted the balance in favour of Modi was the US?s denial of visa to him. Axing Modi, who a senior party leader dubbed ?a symbol of Hindu aspirations?, at this juncture would give credence to the American and Indian secularists? campaign against the Hindutva hardliner.

 The party brass, however, told Modi to behave and address the grievances of the dissidents.

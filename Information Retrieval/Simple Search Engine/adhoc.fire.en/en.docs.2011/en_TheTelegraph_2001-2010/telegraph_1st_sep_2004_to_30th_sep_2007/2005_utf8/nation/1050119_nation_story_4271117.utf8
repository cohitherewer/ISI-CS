 Pastor fest in glare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Jan. 18: The row over US pastor Benny Hinn?s discourses took a legal twist today with Karnataka High Court asking for reports from the state government and the organisers on intentions of the three-day Festival of Blessings starting on Friday.

 A division bench of Justices S.R. Nayak and Ajith Gunjan asked for the reports by Thursday following a public interest litigation by Jagdish Karanth of Hindu Jagaran Vedike. 

 The judges ordered that notices be issued to the state government, the Bangalore commissioner of police and the organisers of the prayer meeting, as the PIL charged that the event would cause communal tension in the city. The rally would be in violation of Article 25 of the Constitution (prohibition of conversions), the petition contended.

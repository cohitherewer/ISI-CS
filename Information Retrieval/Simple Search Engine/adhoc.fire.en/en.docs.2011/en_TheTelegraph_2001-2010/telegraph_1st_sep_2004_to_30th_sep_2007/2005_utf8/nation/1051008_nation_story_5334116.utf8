 Left sets Monday for return decision

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: To go back or to stay put ? the day of decision is near, with just the weekend in between.

 Come Monday, senior leaders of the four Left parties ? the CPM, CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc ? will meet to take a decision on Sonia Gandhis letter yesterday requesting them to return to the co-ordination committee they formed with the ruling UPA. 

 Most likely, the Left parties will rejoin the commission as their official position has been that the government should formally communicate its decision to put on hold the move to divest shares in Bhel, a public sector navratna.

 We were waiting for a formal response from the government. We have received a formal letter, a senior Left leader said. So why should we stay out of the committee?

 The Left parties have to thrash out a consensus on Monday before conveying their decision to the Congress high command. But two of the smaller parties ? the RSP and the Forward Bloc ? may be reluctant to return on the ground that the letter from Sonia gave an assurance only about Bhel.

 The Left wants the Centre to give an assurance that it would not touch public sector navratnas. But Sonias letter has not given any such assurance.

 The letter indicated that the government was not discarding its divestment policy. Moreover, the Bhel divestment has been kept on hold, not abandoned. 

 We will take a unanimous decision, said CPI secretary A.B. Bardhan.

 Some Left leaders believe they would send out a belligerent message to the Congress if they decide to stay away from the co-ordination committee. We can take such a decision only if we decide not to support the government. The situation does not arise now, said a Left leader.

 The UPA government has also opened another flank of confrontation with the Left ? on Iran. In a diplomatic surprise, Delhi joined the US last month in voting to refer Tehrans nuclear programme to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions.

 The same day the Left decides whether to rejoin the coordination committee, it would preside over a meeting with like-minded parties, such as the Samajwadi Party and the RJD. The agenda: a nation-wide campaign against the Centre for succumbing to US pressure in Vienna.

 Advani keeps hot seat suspense alive

 Chennai, Sept. 17: L.K. Advani today seemed to relish the suspense on whether he would continue as BJP president, telling newspersons during an informal chat that the confusion suits his party.

 On the second day of the BJPs national executive, members minds didnt seem to be on the message put out by Advanis presidential speech yesterday. The nub of the speech ? and the political resolution, which was ratified today ? was: its time the party found its feet and functioned as a robust, aggressive Opposition.

 The question uppermost on everyones minds was, would Advani bring the conclave to a dramatic end tomorrow by announcing his resignation ? or, at least, unveiling a timetable for his exit?

 The man himself, his close aides and the spokesperson seemed intent on keeping the party and the media on edge.

 The BJP chief is expected to briefly make his concluding remarks tomorrow after Atal Bihari Vajpayees address. What should have been a minor ritual gathered the gravity of a make-or-break drama as a source close to Advanis arch-rival, Murli Manohar Joshi, told some journalists that this was the first time a party president would deliver a concluding speech.

 Spokesperson Sushma Swaraj kept the suspense alive. Asked if Advani would go by December, she replied: I have no knowledge of whether he is resigning in December or tomorrow.

 The man himself was in high spirits at his chat with the media in the evening, playfully encouraging but cleverly dodging queries about his possible resignation. At the end he suddenly quipped, rather mysteriously, that this sort of confusion suits the party and left.

 Three broad strands of opinion emerged on the subject today. Some dismissed the exit rumour out of hand, blaming a TV channel with starting it all.

 The Bihar representatives felt Advanis departure a month before the Assembly polls would scupper their plans to dislodge the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Reason: It would send the message that Advani was quitting under Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pressure and that his successor will be putty in the Sanghs hands, a Bihar MP said.

 This will hasten the process of communal polarisation and help Laloo Prasad Yadav. It will also antagonise our secular ally, the Janata Dal (United).

 Advanis well-wishers from the Jan Sangh days feared the BJP would disintegrate if he were to go, because there is no clear successor while there are too many pretenders to his chair.

 Another view, expressed by a Rajya Sabha MP, was that Advani should forget about the Bihar polls and quit, because that is the only way he can still retain whatever moral authority he has left.

 Vajpayee doesnt hold a post, yet his authority is so overwhelming that he can decide who should be expelled and who should not be. Similarly, Advani does not need a formal title to wield power. But if he continues to cling to the post, he may lose whatever respect he commands.

 At a public meeting later in the day, Advani was extremely reverential of Vajpayee. Sources close to Advani said that he was disturbed by the charge of being power-hungry and would have given up the party chiefs post; but he doesnt want to be seen as bowing to Sangh pressure. 

 The Sanghs original script required Advani to quit before or immediately after the Chennai meeting.

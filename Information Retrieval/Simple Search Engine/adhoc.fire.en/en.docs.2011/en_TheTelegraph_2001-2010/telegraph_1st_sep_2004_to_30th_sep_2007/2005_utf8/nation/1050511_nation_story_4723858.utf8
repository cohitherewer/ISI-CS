 Patil backs life in jail for rape

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 10: Faced with rising incidents of rape and a dilemma over sentencing culprits to death, home minister Shivraj Patil today said he favours life sentence without commutation for rapists.

 Replying to a discussion on the report of a committee on judicial reforms, Patil said its recommendation of life in prison till death ? rather than death sentence as advocated by his predecessor L.K. Advani ? was ?very, very salutary?. In India, life imprisonment is commuted to 14 years and ?nothing more than that?, he added.

 Patils comments came on a day Delhi police claimed they had zeroed in on the rapists who, early on Sunday, dragged a 20-year-old into a car, which was then driven all over the city without being spotted.

 The police believe a gang of auto-lifters is behind the crime and have identified one person as the prime suspect from a list of eight. ?...The victim was shown dossiers in which she identified some of them as having resemblance,? deputy commissioner, south west, Dipender Pathak said today. 

 The girl, a Delhi University student from Mizoram, was walking with a friend to a paratha stall around 2 am when she was abducted by four men in a Santro.

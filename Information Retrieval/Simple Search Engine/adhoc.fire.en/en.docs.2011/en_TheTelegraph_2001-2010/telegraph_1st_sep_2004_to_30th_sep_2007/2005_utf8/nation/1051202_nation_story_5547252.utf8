 Fatal jump query at IIT

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 1: The question had come out of the blue.

 What if one jumps from the fourth floor? S. Chandrakant Dharskar had asked his classmate Aveek Das.

 Why are you asking this? the second-year mechanical engineering student of IIT Kanpur had shot back.

 He did not get an answer. It was 6.30 in the morning. An hour later, Das and some other students found Dharskars body on a lawn near the faculty building.

 Twenty feet away in the grass lay three broken teeth, the dead students slippers and a damaged wristwatch. The post-mortem report revealed a fractured left leg, ruptured intestine and some broken rib bones.

 A day after the tragedy, police think the 20-year-old may have committed suicide. Investigations have revealed Dharskar left his hostel room at 5 and came to the library in the faculty building. On his way back he met Das, hung around for some time and then called up his father, C. Dharskar, before going up to the terrace.

 Yes, I spoke to him. He was quiet, but I did not find anything abnormal in his voice, his father said today.

 The grieving parents reached here this morning and were present when their son was cremated.

 A section of teachers had at first thought Dharskar may have had a heart attack. But even the police admitted that heart attack and his going up to the terrace was too much of a coincidence.

 Kanpur superintendent of police P.C. Meena said Dharskar might have been under psychological pressure caused by peers, parents and social status. But the IITs deputy director, Kripa Shankar, said Dharskar was an above average student. There was no pressure on him from our side.

 Roommate Krishna Kumar Khandelwal said Dharskar did not show any sign of being disturbed. Khandelwal said the two had studied till 2.30 am as they were to sit for a chemistry test in a couple of days.

 When he got up in the morning, Khandelwal said, he came to know that his roommate had been found dead.

 Student counsellor Dr Amrita Dass said it was time parents and teachers contribute to reducing pressure by asking students to keep aside time to chill out with friends.

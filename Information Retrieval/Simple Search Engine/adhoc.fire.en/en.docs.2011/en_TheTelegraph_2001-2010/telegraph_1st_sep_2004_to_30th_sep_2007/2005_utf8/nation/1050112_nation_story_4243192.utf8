 Dal leader quits with George barb

 - Seat deal claims first victim

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Fernandes: Under fire

 Patna, Jan. 11: The Janata Dal (United)?s tie-up with the BJP for the coming polls today claimed its first casualty with party general secretary Tanveer Hasan resigning from his post.

 JD (U) leaders, however, said Hasan ?used? the tie-up excuse to quit the post and was on his way to leaving the party to join some ?convenient? outfit. Although not a heavyweight, Hasan, party leader in the legislative council, was often portrayed as the JD (U)?s pro-minority face. He also quit as party leader in the council.

 Hasan faxed his resignation to JD (U) president George Fernandes, claiming that most party workers were against joining hands with the BJP and this was reflected at its executive meeting at Ranchi in November last year. 

 ?Fernandes? love for the BJP has made the JD (U) directionless. His irresponsible statements, attending BJP?s rallies and even programmes of the RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad have made the situation ludicrous,? Hasan said in his letter.

 ?Under his leadership, there is a lack of coordination between the different levels of the party. Instead, a Rashtriya Swabhiman Manch has been set up. The JD (U) has become an appendage of the BJP,? he alleged.

 Sources in the party said Hasan?s resignation established that he was not in favour of defeating Laloo Prasad Yadav in Bihar. ?His resignation will not affect the party?s health in any manner,? a JD (U) spokesperson said.

 The development came soon after controversial RJD MP and Union minister Mohammad Taslimuddin tried to build pressure on Laloo Prasad by threatening to quit the party?s parliamentary board. 

 Sources close to Taslimuddin said he was ?deeply annoyed? with the RJD president for not consulting him in deciding the names of candidates, especially for the Kishanganj-Araria-Purnea region.

 But RJD sources said the threat was not serious and Taslimuddin ?has been known to resort to such tactics?. 

 ?When the NDA upped the ante against Taslimuddin, demanding his resignation from the Union ministry, Laloo Prasad did not say anything against him. The government went out of its way to get the case against him quashed. If he is really upset he should resign as a minister,? the sources added.

 Taslimuddin is known to claim that his stature is bigger than that of Laloo Prasad in his region. He has also tried to present himself as a leader of the minorities, a contention not liked by the RJD president.

 The RJD continued its sessions today to finalise its list of candidates but the details were not divulged.

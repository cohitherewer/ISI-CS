 Private hand for defence

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 5: A committee, set up by the defence ministry to involve the private sector in defence equipment production, has recommended a relaxation of rules governing exports of military hardware. 

 The committee, headed by economist Vijay Kelkar, has also suggested to the government that it should formulate policies to involve major private companies to take up manufacture of military equipment and become steady suppliers to the armed forces.

 The committee today submitted the first part of its report, titled Towards Strengthening Self-Reliance in Defence Preparedness, to defence minister Pranab Mukherjee. Kelkar said the panel had recommended that the government should consider taking on board private companies as co-producers of strategic weapons.

 The report said a pruning of the negative list for exports would enable companies to scour markets overseas and make their business viable because they would not be solely dependent on orders from the Indian armed forces.

 The committee has recommended a 15-year purchase plan under which small and medium companies could be involved in the acquisition of identified products. It said two outfits ? one to promote exports and another for acquisitions ? should be set up and private industries should collaborate in processes with the Defence Research and Development Organisation.

 The committee was set up in July last year and was asked to study the defence industry and advise on acquisition and production. The members of the committee included the three vice-chiefs of the armed forces, bureaucrats, scientists and industry representatives.

 Kelkar said private sector participation would bring down dependence on imports from one-fourth to three-fourths in five to 10 years. 

 Mukherjee said after accepting the report that the government was keen on encouraging defence exports to make the defence business viable for companies in the sector.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Britain pleads with ICC

 AMIT ROY

 London, Jan. 10: The British government is making a last-ditch attempt to persuade the International Cricket Council to remain in London and not shift its headquarters to a more tax-friendly location such as Dubai.

 This follows a report that the ICC has voted 11-1 to move to Dubai in April. Calcutta has not been in the reckoning at all as an alternative to Dubai.

 Although the ICC is giving the appearance of having made up its mind, the British sports minister, Richard Caborn, managed a 45-minute meeting today with Ehsan Mani, the ICC president, to persuade him to remain in London.

 The ICC, the game?s governing body, has been located at Lord?s for 95 years. It calculates it could save over ?1 million by obtaining tax concessions from the treasury, the equivalent of the finance ministry. Although its suit was pressed by UK Sport, a promotional body, and the department of culture, media and sport, the request for tax concessions was rejected by the treasury.

 After today?s meeting, Caborn told Mani that he would again make representations on behalf of the ICC to the treasury but he ?couldn?t promise anything?.

 The general feeling in cricket circles is that the Labour government does not care too much for cricket which it considers a game for the upper classes. But the government is also aware that Britain?s bid for the 2012 Olympics could be damaged if it is seen to be doing nothing to stop such an important organisation as the ICC from quitting London.

 The ICC spokesman refused to comment on whether its members had voted 11-1 to shift to Dubai. It was reported that the 10 Test playing nations, along with Kenya, an associate member, had supported the proposed move to Dubai, while Israel had abstained and Malaysia had wanted its own capital, Kuala Lumpur.

 The vote was held three weeks ago but the ICC had not made the announcement ?as final negotiations with Dubai are ongoing?. Singapore had also made an ?attractive offer?. On the record, the ICC spokesman would only say: ?The ICC is considering where to base its premises but no decision has been taken.? 

 Privately, the ICC hopes it will not have to move from London, although it points out that its premises at Lord?s are now inadequate.

 The negotiations with Dubai have been going on for six months, sources say. Since the treasury has set its face against allowing tax concessions to major sports bodies, the ICC is warning the government that it will have no option but to move. But it is not still clear when or if this will finally happen.

 Ahead of his meeting with Mani, Caborn told The Daily Telegraph of London: ?I have a brief in front of me and there are a number of issues I want to discuss. I understand the reasons for the move are not just tax but there are also questions of broadening the base of the ICC and repositioning it as a global game.?

 He said: ?Many of the Commonwealth sports are going through that process and badminton is considering relocating to Kuala Lumpur. We have to face realities. But London will always be an important centre, both because of its geographical position and the facilities in banking? and other things it offers.?

 After the meeting, a spokesman for the department said: ?We would love the ICC to stay.?

 The department would take up the case for tax concessions with the treasury on behalf of all major sports organisations, said the spokesman.

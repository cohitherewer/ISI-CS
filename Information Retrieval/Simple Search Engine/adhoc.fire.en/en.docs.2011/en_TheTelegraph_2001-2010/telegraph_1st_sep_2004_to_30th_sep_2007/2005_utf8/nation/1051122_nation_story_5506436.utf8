 Dubai, Nov. 21: The Indian aviation sector is showcasing itself in strength at the Dubai 2005 air show which started yesterday.

 India, which is taking part in the annual air show for the first time, is highlighting the civilian modules of its aerospace achievements at the event. 

 The focus is on the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) that experts credit for turning India into a recognised player in the global market for satellite launch services.

 Sixteen participants are representing India at the air show..

 Notably absent, however, is the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) that has won praise globally, most recently for its advanced light helicopter and the light combat aircraft Tejas.

 Air Commodore (retd) J. Varkey, honorary secretary of the Society of Indian Aerospace Technologies and Industry (Siati), the nodal agency for the Indian aerospace sector, said HAL has decided to wait and watch till the next show. 

 Although India is a recognised player in the global aerospace sector, Varkey said participation in Dubai 2005 would contribute to its presence in the regional market.

 Besides being the biggest such event in West Asia, he said, Dubai 2005 is a platform for civilian products and services of Indian aerospace players.

 Unlike other participants, Isro is displaying the wide-ranging services it offers.

 Models of a few communication and remote-sensing satellites designed, built and put into orbit by Isro by its own launch vehicles are also on display at the Indian pavilion.

 India is set to host the worlds biggest space event, International Astronautical Congress, in 2007.

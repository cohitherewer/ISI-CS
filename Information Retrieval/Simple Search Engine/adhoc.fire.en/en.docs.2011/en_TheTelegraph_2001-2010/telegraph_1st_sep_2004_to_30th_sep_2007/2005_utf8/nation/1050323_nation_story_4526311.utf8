 April date for aircraft carrier

 New Delhi, March 22: Naval engineers will cut the steel next month to build India?s first aircraft carrier, making the country the fourth in the world with such capability, reports our special correspondent.

 Construction of the 37,500-tonne air defence ship that has been on the drawing board for four years will begin at the Cochin shipyard on April 11, the navy announced here today.

 The navy has one aircraft carrier ? the INS Viraat ? that was given a refit last year to extend its life to 2008. The Admiral Gorshkov, which has been contracted with Russia, is expected that year. It will be rechristened the INS Vikramaditya. The indigenous carrier is expected to be commissioned into the service in 2012.

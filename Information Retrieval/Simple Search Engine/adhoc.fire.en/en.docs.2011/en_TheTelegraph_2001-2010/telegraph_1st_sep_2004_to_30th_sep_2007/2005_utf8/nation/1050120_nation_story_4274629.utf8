 BJP lets Modi loose on Bihar

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: With Laloo Prasad Yadav using the Godhra report to consolidate minority votes and the BJP releasing Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi into the battlefield, poll-bound Bihar appears set for a campaign on communal lines.

 Although all BJP chief ministers will be used in the campaign, Modi has been allotted the maximum time. He will be in Bihar for three days like Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 

 L.K. Advani will be around for five days, as will Murli Manohar Joshi and M. Venkaiah Naidu. Depending on the response Modi gets, he could be asked to stay on for another couple of days. 

 The Gujarat chief minister will also canvass in Jharkhand for four days, especially in tribal areas classified by the BJP as ?communally sensitive? because of the alleged proselytising activities of Christian missionaries. 

 So far, the BJP?s feedback has been that tribal votes could be polarised in favour of either the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha or the Congress while the non-tribal votes might drift away from it because of the ?anti-incumbency? sentiment. 

 The BJP, sources admitted, is left with no option but to try and mobilise votes on communal lines in the tribal belt.

 The presence of Uma Bharti in Bihar for 20 days was another sign that the thrust could be communal. 

 While the BJP?s initial idea in using Uma was to play the ?backward caste? card to counter Laloo Prasad, Bihar leaders did not support the reasoning. 

 They felt her backward caste ?appeal? would not necessarily translate into votes because she is a Lodhi Rajput, a sub-caste that barely exists in Bihar. 

 Varun Gandhi, the young ?savvy? face of the BJP, has been engaged for six days. 

 Sushma Swaraj, who was initially allotted more time in Bihar and Jharkhand, may be grounded in Haryana, where the BJP is going it alone. She will be in Haryana for 17 days, seven days in Bihar and five in Jharkhand.

 Advani will also experiment with the idea of having an assistant to state prabaris (in-charge). He will not be designated a prabari but will do the same job. 

 The official Bihar prabari, Arun Jaitley, will now have Pramod Mahajan for back-up, while Rajnath Singh will be assisted by Ananth Kumar in Jharkhand and Shivraj Singh Chauhan will have Madan Lal Khurana by his side in Haryana. 

 Mahajan, Kumar and Khurana will camp in their designated areas during the elections.

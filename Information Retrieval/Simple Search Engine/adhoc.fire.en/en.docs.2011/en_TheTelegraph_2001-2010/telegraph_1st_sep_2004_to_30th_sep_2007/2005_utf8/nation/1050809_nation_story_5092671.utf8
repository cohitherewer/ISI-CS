 Ball in court, govt calls it a day

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: A restive 

 Justice G.T. Nanavati today defended his observation that 

 credible evidence exists against Jagdish Tytler, saying 

 there was no reason to disbelieve the person who had deposed 

 before the commission against the Union minister.

 The retired judge said he chose to write very probably because further evidence against Tytler was not conclusive. That is why I recommended that the government should look into this aspect and take action as may be found necessary, he added. 

 The Centre, however, made it clear that no other commission would be constituted to probe the 1984 riots again.

 Nanavati refused to comment on the governments action taken report (ATR), pointing out that his job was only to look into the riots and carry out an independent and objective inquiry. 

 I cannot speak about the ATR. It is not for my satisfaction but for Parliament where it will be discussed. It is for Parliament to decide whether appropriate action has been taken on the recommendations. And ultimately, it will be put before public scrutiny, which is the most important thing in a democracy, Nanavati said at his home.

 He maintained that local Congress leaders were in some way involved in the riots and a further probe was needed.

 The Centre, however, said it has no such plans. How many commissions are needed to go again and again into the same thing? Somewhere it all must end, home ministry special secretary K.P. Singh said.

 The official said the Centre did not institute a fresh probe against Tytler as recommended by the commission because it cannot proceed on mere probability.

 Defending the ATR, Singh said that out of the 10 recommendations of the commission, the government had accepted nine. Only in the case of Tytler, the government concluded that it cannot proceed.

 The Supreme Court is very clear about the law on probabilities. We cannot go ahead and prosecute anyone only on the basis of probability. In Mr Tytlers case, the commission itself was not absolutely sure of his involvement. The commission says that very probably, he had a hand. The incident mentioned has been tried in court. Out of the 45 accused, 13 were convicted and the remaining were acquitted, said Singh.

 The commission, in fact, had given only observations and not any specific recommendations. The government had to cull out 10 specific recommendations after going exhaustively through the details of the incidents given in the report, he added.

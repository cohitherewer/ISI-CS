 Smooth sailing for Delhis G4 draft

 K.P. NAYAR

 New York, June 10: An impressive 160 of the UNs 191 member states attended a meeting to discuss an amended draft resolution by India and three other countries, which would pave the way for an expanded Security Council without veto power for new members.

 Not one of these 160 countries voiced any opposition to the new draft. Britain and France inscribed their names as co-sponsors at this meeting a day before the new draft was made public yesterday. 

 Only 128 votes, two-thirds of the UN General Assemblys membership, are needed to pass the resolution, paving the way for expanding the Security Council.

 Indias willingness to give up its insistence on the demand for veto power for new permanent members of the Security Council broke what was emerging as a unified stand by all five existing permanent members of the council (P5) in favour of status quo at the UNs high table.

 India was the last among the Group of Four (G4) countries ? India, Germany, Japan and Brazil ? to compromise on the demand for veto for new permanent members in a restructured Security Council.

 A unified stand by the P5 against the G4 draft resolution would have ended the quest by New Delhi and others for the Security Councils permanent membership, at least for the time being. Ratification of Security Council reform by the P5 is one of several mandatory steps for such reform to enter into force.

 Germanys permanent representative to the UN, Gunter Pleuger, said that by circulating a new draft, devoid of the veto demand, we have tried to seek a formula that takes care of differing interests, of the interests of the P5 not to be touched in their status, the interests of the new permanent members not to be discriminated against, and we also take care of the opinion of more than 100 delegations that the veto is undemocratic and outdated.

 The revised draft is now slated to be tabled in the UN General Assembly as early as next week, once Indias ambassador to the UN, Nirupam Sen, returns from Doha after attending the South summit.

 Sen left for Doha today to drum up support for Indias case for Security Council reform among 50 heads of state and representatives of more than 50 other Group of 77 (G-77) countries attending the summit.

 On Wednesday, 80 of these countries had attended a lunch organised here by Sen and other G4 ambassadors at which the new draft was discussed. None of the 80 states opposed the new draft. 

 Sen said before emplaning for the South summit that the revised draft is something that would safeguard our interest.

 Once the G4 agreed on dropping their insistence on veto and crafted a new draft resolution, there was a whirlwind of diplomatic activity here. The lunch for G77 countries was preceded by a meeting between the G4 and co-sponsors of their resolution to discuss the new draft. Then came the meeting of 160 General Assembly members in the UNs Economic and Social Council (Ecosoc) Hall.

 Around the same time, Russian diplomats at the UN met their counterparts from the African Union and conveyed Moscows opposition to granting veto power to members of the Security Council.

 China said we believe that member states should continue democratic consultations to find a solution that accommodates the interests of all parties...rather than having revisions or modifications on a highly divisive proposal.

 Vietnam, a supporter of Security Council expansion, also expressed itself against more of veto within the Council.

 Meanwhile, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice telephoned Japanese foreign minister Nobutaka Machimura in an effort to pressurise Tokyo to delay tabling the G4 resolution at the UN. The US, which is supporting only Japans case for entry into the council, decided to pressure Machimura once it concluded that a G4 resolution had a fair chance of being adopted with the required two-thirds majority this month. But the Japanese have so far resisted US pressure and are sticking to the timetable jointly agreed among the G4 countries.

 Sen said today that the new G-4 strategy will hasten the process of creating new permanent members in the Security Council.

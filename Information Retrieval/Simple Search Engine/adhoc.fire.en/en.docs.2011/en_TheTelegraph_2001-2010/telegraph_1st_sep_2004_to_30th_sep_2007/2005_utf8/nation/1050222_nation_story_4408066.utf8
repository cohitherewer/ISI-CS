 Drop-out rate worry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: The Prime Minister today expressed concern over the failure of state governments to stem the ?unacceptably high? drop-out rates in primary and elementary schools. 

 He was speaking at the first meeting of the governing council of the national literacy mission, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan. ?The drop-out rate in schools in unacceptably high. The reasons are lack of adequate facilities, largescale absenteeism of teachers and inadequate supervision by local authorities,? Manmohan Singh said. 

 For girls, the drop out rate is 33.72 per cent in primary education and it is 35.5 per cent for boys. In elementary education, the rate is 53.45 per cent and 52.28 per cent respectively. The responsibility of enrolment of students and their retention lies with the state governments. Over the years, enrolment has increased but the drop-out rate not arrested.

 The Sarva Siksha Abhiyan?s aim is to have all children in the 6-14 age group complete five years of primary education by 2007 and eight years of schooling by 2010.

 ?I want a sense of urgency to inform the programme. State governments must come forward with innovative policies,? he said. Singh reiterated the Centre?s promise to provide funds but said the ?state governments also must match it with an equal determination? to succeed in the mission.

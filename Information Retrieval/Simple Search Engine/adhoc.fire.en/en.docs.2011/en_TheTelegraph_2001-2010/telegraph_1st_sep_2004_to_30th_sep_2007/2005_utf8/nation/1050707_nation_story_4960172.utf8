 Plotter unclear, motive no doubt

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, July 6: Delhi does not know for sure yet who was behind the Ayodhya attack but it has some inkling about the motive.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil said today the attackers might have disliked the progress in the peace process between India and Pakistan. 

 Why did they come there? They wanted to disturb the existing harmony of the country. These attackers might have had a problem with the progress in the peace process between India and Pakistan, Patil said. 

 The minister said the attack on the complex was aimed at dividing people of the country? to drive a wedge between people of one faith and another and it is our duty to see that it does not succeed.

 He rejected the charge that the attack was the result of an intelligence failure, saying the information available to the Centre was passed on to the state government.

 How can you say that it is an intelligence failure? Whatever information we get is made available to the state government. But we cannot divulge it to everybody, Patil told reporters after a visit to the makeshift temple in Ayodhya.

 The minister, however, said that the militants had the advantage of time and the surprise element.

 The group behind the attack had not yet been identified and the matter was being investigated. You (the media) would come to know about it when we gather evidence to this effect, he said.

 Intelligence sources in Delhi said they are not ruling out any possibility at the moment. Preliminary investigations are still on and we cannot confirm anything till they are done, a senior home ministry official said.

 Patil was all praise for the security personnel at the Ayodhya complex. They should be congratulated. They helped avert a major crisis or else the consequence would have been grave, he said.

 The home minister went to Ayodhya along with Uttar Pradesh Congress president Salman Khursheed and a party general secretary. 

 Patil had invited CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, too, but he could not go as he was preoccupied with party affairs in the capital.

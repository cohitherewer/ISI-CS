 Parveen Babi left no will

Parveen Babi

 Mumbai, Jan. 24: Police today said they did not find any will left by actor Parveen Babi.

 ?We have sealed her flat. We are waiting for someone to come forward and make a claim to her property, but no one has so far,? said deputy commissioner of police Amitabh Gupta. 

 The police would wait for some time for a claimant and then hand over the matter to the administrator-general, the civil authority concerned. 

 Gupta said the police were involved in the property matters now as they found the actor?s body in her flat. The actress lived in a four-room 2,200-square foot terrace apartment in Juhu, which is valued at Rs 1.6 crore.

 A question mark remains over her property in Junagadh, Gujarat, from where she hailed. Coming from a landowner?s family, the actor had inherited property worth Rs 3 crore from her parents, both of whom are dead. She was their only child.

 Yesterday, some relatives from Junagadh performed her last rites. But it does not mean they will be considered for inheriting the property, the police said.

 Pappu shift on hold

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Supreme Court today reserved its judgment on the issue of shifting Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav from Beur Central Jail in Patna to some prison outside Bihar.

 The division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha said the court would take all possible steps to prevent jails from getting converted into ?headquarters of crime?.

 The court observed that the ?illegal activities? of the MP who ?failed to be a model by his conduct? should be curtailed.

 The apex bench asked the CBI to seize all documents relating to Pappu Yadav?s admission to Patna Medical College and Hospital while he was supposed to be in jail and the ?nexus? between the officers and the MP, who was given ?five-star? treatment. 

 Senior counsel for Pappu Yadav, R.K. Jain, pleaded that shifting the accused outside the state would curtail his fundamental right to meet family members and suggested that the MP be shifted to some other jail in Bihar or even Delhi where his wife and children live.

 At this, the judges observed that Pappu Yadav has not shown any respect to the repeated order of the court. 

 ?We are satisfied that Beur jail is not in a position to keep a check on this prisoner. Beur jail is supposed to be a model jail in Bihar. If the model jail itself is bad, then what do you do?? Justice Hegde asked the counsel.

 The court also asked the district sessions judge of Madhepura to collect the ordersheets of the additional sessions judge in connection with the case in which Pappu Yadav was summoned and submit them before the court within two weeks.

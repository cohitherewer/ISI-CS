 CD had songs, not riot: RJD

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 13: The Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar today officially denied having any link with the compact discs containing footage of Gujarat riots, in the party?s reply to the Election Commission?s showcause notice.

 ?The party has denied the allegation as it has nothing to do with the objectionable CDs in question,? Ram Kripal Yadav, the RJD?s Patna MP, said after meeting chief electoral officer K.C. Saha this afternoon.

 ?We know only of one (CD), which contains qawwali songs, that has been circulated with the poll panel?s proper permission,? he added.

 The RJD?s written reply was submitted to Saha by a party team on behalf of state chief Abdul Bari Siddiqui a day before the deadline.

 Assistant chief electoral officer S.H. Mantoo acknowledged receiving the reply and hinted that the commission would now probe the matter.

 The RJD delegation said it was ready to face an investigation.

 The poll panel had yesterday sought an explanation after the Opposition complained of the controversial CDs? screening, allegedly in Purnea, Kishanganj and Araria, which go to the polls in the second phase on February 15.

 The poll panel fixed February 14 as the deadline for the RJD?s reply but later revised it to 7 pm yesterday itself.

 Party leaders rushed to the commission, pleading inability to meet the early deadline as the RJD?s national and state presidents were out of town.

 Today, Purnea police cracked down on the controversial CDs? screening in violation of the model code of conduct and registered cases against two persons at Bhawani police station.

 The model code says electioneering must steer clear of ?communalising? the electorate.

 A source said that Bima Bharati, the RJD candidate from Rupauli, too, faces allegations in the case but has not been named in the FIR.

 The BJP demanded that the poll panel probe the CD affair and punish the guilty. ?It is surely the handiwork of the RJD. But Laloo (Prasad Yadav) has not enough guts to accept the truth. He always tries to show off as a big hero but backs out like a coward when cornered,? a BJP worker alleged.

 The RJD team that called on the chief electoral officer comprised Ram Kripal Yadav, general secretary Ram Vachan Rai, campaign chairman Bhola Prasad Singh and treasurer Rakesh Ranjan.

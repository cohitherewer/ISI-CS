 Thackeray breathes fire

 Mumbai, Nov. 29: After a days suspense, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray breathed fire at nephew Raj, who resigned from all party posts on Sunday.

 Sending the signal that Raj could leave the party if he wanted, Thackeray, in a charged editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna, said no one was bigger than the party.

 He said the Sena was not anyones personal property, but belonged to Shiv Sainiks who worked for the party and to ordinary Maharashtrians.

 Thackeray said if Rajs followers had wanted to show their might, they should have done so in Malwan, which the Sena lost after decades to Narayan Rane.

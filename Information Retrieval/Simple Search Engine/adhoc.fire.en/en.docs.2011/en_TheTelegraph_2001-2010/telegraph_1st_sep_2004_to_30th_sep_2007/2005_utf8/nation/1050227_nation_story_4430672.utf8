 The other voice of Pakistan

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Listen, the other Pakistan is speaking. 

 ?We can get attacked for speaking in favour of the peace process (with India), violence against women or interpreting Islam as a redundant and oppressive religion which we believe it is not or speaking in favour of the working classes,? said Omar Malik, a youth who works for a multinational company. 

 Liberals and peaceniks can get beaten up for being too vocal, agreed Imam Shamil, who, along with Omar, is part of a 25-member group of Pakistani youths in India for a Pakistan-India People?s Forum for Peace and Democracy convention. 

 They claimed they were bringing the voice of Pakistan?s silent majority to play in the peace initiatives that so far has been dominated by the ?voice of the establishment? piped out by students of elitist institutions that breed the top brass. 

 Imam, who works with an NGO fighting on issues like violence against women, wants the forum to give voice to a lesser-known Pakistan. 

 ?There are two Pakistans ? one is elitist, (including those) who come for the civil initiatives of peace, and the other, extremely poor and oblivious to what is happening around the world. Its only worry is roti, kapda and makan,? said Imam.

 ?A peace initiative will not be successful unless it addresses the downtrodden and the youth,? added Omar. 

 Ten years after the establishment of the forum, the likes of Imam, Omar and Nusrat from Islamabad and Lady Sri Ram College students Shraddha Bhandari and Divya Ratan are putting their heads together to organise its first youth chapter. 

 This is the forum?s first attempt at giving a voice to the post-Independence generations in both countries that do not carry the baggage of Partition. 

 Laying the foundation of the youth chapter will be the first youth assembly in New Delhi tomorrow. 

 Initiation of joint projects related to culture, education and globalisation for the youth are on the agenda of the assembly. 

 ?We are going to start with small projects just for a beginning,? said Nusrat, busy planning out the schedule for the assembly. 

 The relatively small group of 25 youths who managed to obtain visas to India would be complemented by Indian students from Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia and other institutions at the assembly. 

 Shraddha has chosen to set the tone at the convention with two movies ? the Oscar-nominated (in the short film category) Little Terrorist by young Indian filmmaker Ashvin Kumar and Pakistani pop band Junoon?s lead guitarist Salman Ahmad?s film, The Rock Star and the Mullah.

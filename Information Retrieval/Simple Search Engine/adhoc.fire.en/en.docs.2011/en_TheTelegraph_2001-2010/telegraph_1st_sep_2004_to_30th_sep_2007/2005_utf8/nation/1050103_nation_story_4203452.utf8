 Alarm on drop in sessions

 Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 2 (PTI): The number of sittings in Parliament have decreased steadily since 1988 to 80 days from an earlier average of 138 days, a report released today said.

 In 2003, the number of sittings stood at 74 with the Lok Sabha losing over 60 hours due to disruptions, said the report titled Citizens? Report on Governance and Development 2004. It, however, said the parliamentary committees performed positively in this duration.

 The report, which was prepared with the help of non-government organisations and released by Social Watch India, also said that at the end of each session, 30 to 40 bills were left pending in both Houses.

 However, the time lost in 2003 was less than the previous year. The report attributed this time loss to increased media attention on Parliament. It also noted that there was mounting displeasure over the way public money was being squandered. 

 The study estimated the cost of parliamentary transactions to be Rs 18,430 per minute. 

 CPI leader in the Lok Sabha P.K. Vasudevan Nair, while releasing the report, said there was need for a system which would guarantee that assurances made in Parliament would get implemented. Although there was an assurance committee, the commitments made in the House often went unimplemented, Nair, also the chairman of the committee on labour, said.

 The study also stated that the annual growth rate of employment had declined generally in the 1990s but the fall had been steeper in rural India. During the second half of the nineties, employment growth in agriculture almost dried up due to reduction in public development expenditure, a decline in input subsidies and rural credit.

 In the judiciary, the high pendency rate of cases, archaic laws and delays were causes of concern.

 The Supreme Court, however, has brought down the number of pending cases from over a lakh to about 20,000 through systematic judicial measures. The current rate of disposal and fresh filing of cases promised a zero-pendency future for the apex court, the report said.

 The study said southern states were doing a better job of promoting women?s leadership compared to the northern ones. 

 Although finance commissions had been set up in all states, only Kerala, Bengal, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan had largely accepted the recommendations of the commissions.

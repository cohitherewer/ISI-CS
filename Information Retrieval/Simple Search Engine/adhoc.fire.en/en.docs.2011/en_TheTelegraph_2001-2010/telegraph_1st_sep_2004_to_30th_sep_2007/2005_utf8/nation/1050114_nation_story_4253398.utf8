Tremors

 Karaikal, Pondicherry, Jan. 13 (PTI): Fishermen who were the most vocal in their protest against government restrictions on habitation within 500 metres of the sea shore are now ready to shift their homes as far away from the sea as possible. 

 The fishing and non-fishing communities living close to the sea in the 30 coastal villages and hamlets here were the worst hit by the tsunami. The Pondicherry government that has been pressing for stricter regulation zones now says that almost overnight, people from the coastal villages have agreed to shift their habitation a kilometre away.

 Porayar (PTI): A 10-year-old boy, playing on a mound of old clothes meant for tsunami victims, died after he got entangled in it. Sanitary workers retrieved Thasthagir Malik?s body on Wednesday evening in Nagore in Tamil Nadu?s Nagapattinam district when they were removing the piles of clothes. The boy?s father had lodged a complaint with police after the boy went missing on January 7.

 Batapola, Sri Lanka (AP): Police have arrested a 63-year-old man on charges of trying to sell his two granddaughters, aged 7 and 9, after their home was destroyed and their mother killed in the tsunami.

Somadasa was released on bail, police said. The two girls were placed in the custody of their father.

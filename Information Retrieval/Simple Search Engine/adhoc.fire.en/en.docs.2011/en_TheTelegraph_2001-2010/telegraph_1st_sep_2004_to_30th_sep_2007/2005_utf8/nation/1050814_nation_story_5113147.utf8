 Equality row over quota respite

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: The Supreme Court judgment freeing unaided educational institutions from state-imposed quotas has triggered debate on how this squares with the constitutional provisions of reservation and equality.

 A seven-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti, yesterday ruled that neither the policy of reservation can be enforced by the state nor any quota or percentage of admissions can be carved out to be appropriated by the state in a minority or non-minority unaided educational institution.

 This means private colleges that do not take government aid can even scrap the seat quotas for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students.

 B. Devasekhar, counsel for a batch of students in the case, felt the judgment goes against the Constitutions concept of reservation for the weaker section in educational institutions.

 This concept, he argued, is based on the principles that there cannot be equality amongst non-equals and that till such time (that) the non-equals become equals? they should be given reserved seats in educational institutions.

 Education is a matter of state policy, Devasekhar said. (The judgment) might directly hit the constitutional provision and there are bound to be more petitions by various states to explain this aspect.

 But another lawyer in the case, R. Anand Padmanabhan, differed. He said the constitutional obligation relates to reservation in government institutions and not in private institutions, and it is within the apex courts constitutional powers to pass such a judgment.

 Padmanabhan drew a parallel with job reservations. Look, you have to have reservation in government jobs but is there reservation in private firms?

 Now, if the government tries to impose job reservation on the private sector, and one of the corporates goes to the Supreme Court, wont it (the court) decide one way or the other? Suppose it decides that the government cannot impose job reservation (on private firms)? it is exactly like that in this case.

 The judgment, however, has left several matters unexplained. For instance, it reaffirms the ban on capitation fees and profiteering and says a committee must regulate this. But it has not specified who would form the committee.

 The judgment has confused many also by saying that unaided minority and non-minority institutions have unfettered fundamental right to choose the students. However, such admissions (should) be regulated by a centralised and single-window procedure. 

 Lawyers are asking who would do the regulation, the state or the institution. If the state does this, what happens to the institutions unfettered right to choose students? Finally, who would check whether a college has been charging capitation fees under some other head?

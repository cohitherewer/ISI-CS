The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Not my letter, says Uma 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jabalpur, Oct. 15: Who did it?

 Uma Bharti today sought to give a spin to the controversy surrounding her outburst against senior RSS and BJP leaders, claiming that the contents of her letter to the Sangh chief were different from the those of the one leaked to the media.

 You (the media) should find out who has leaked it, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said during a state BJP meet in Jabalpur on the banks of the Narmada.

 As far as Im concerned, I had sent three copies to Sudarshanji (RSS chief) Advaniji (BJP chief) and Mohan Bhagwatji (considered number two in the RSS hierarchy). I had even torn off my copy, she said shortly after a dip in the river that many consider holy.

 In Nagpur, the RSS contradicted her claim that her letter to K.S. Sudarshan was not the one being discussed in the media. Spokesman Ram Madhav told PTI over the phone that the excerpts that have found place in certain sections of the media were same as those sent to Sudarshan.

 In Jabalpur, Uma, keen to get back her job in Bhopal, denied using offensive language in her letter. I have not used any non-parliamentary language.... The language of the letter is very balanced and the points touched upon in the letter are very important.

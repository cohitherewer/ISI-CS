 Tytler, Sajjan set to face riot probe again

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: The Centre is likely to reopen the 1984 riot cases against three Congress leaders ? Jagdish Tytler, Sajjan Kumar and Dharam Das Shastri ? rapped by a probe commission for their alleged role in the anti-Sikh pogrom.

 The Union law ministry, after going through the Nanavati Commissions report, has given the home ministry the go-ahead to move against the three politicians, a source said.

 The decision follows a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister Shivraj Patil and law minister H.R. Bhardwaj early this month.

 In all probability, the affidavits filed earlier against the three politicians will be now reopened and looked at afresh by an agency, most likely CBI, a senior government official said. He added that fresh affidavits would not be filed.

 The commissions recommendations and the Centres action-taken report (ATR) were tabled in Parliament on August 8 this year. The panels report said there was credible evidence against Tytler ? then (at the time of tabling) a Union minister ? that he very probably had a hand in organising attacks on Sikhs. The report asked the government to act against him.

 Against Sajjan Kumar, an MP, the commission found credible material and said he was probably involved as alleged by witnesses. The report recommended investigation of cases in which Kumar was an accused.

 The commission also found credible evidence that Shastri, a Delhi Congress leader, had instigated his men Tek Chand Sharma and Rajinder Singh to organise attacks on Sikhs. It suggested further investigation.

 The Centre did virtually nothing, which the ATR justified by splitting hairs over expressions like very probably in the Nanavati report.

 This sparked outrage not only among Sikhs and the Opposition but also among the Congresss alliance partners and the Left. The Prime Minister apologised in Parliament over the inaction and promised to look into the matter of reopening the cases against those named by the commission. Tytler resigned from the ministry under pressure.

 The law ministry, however, has not said anything about reopening cases against two senior officials indicted by the report ? the then Delhi Lieutenant Governor P.G. Gavai and police commissioner S.C. Tandon.

 The commission had spoken of a colossal failure of maintenance of law and order in Delhi and questioned the explanations offered by Gavai and Tandon. Nanavati said Gavai had not given enough importance to the law-and-order situation and accused Tandon of failing to ask officers to be strict with the mobs.

 Justifying the lack of action against the Congress politicians, the ATR had argued that the expression very probably meant the probe panel itself was not sure about Tytlers involvement in the attacks. It may be pointed out that in criminal cases, a person cannot be prosecuted simply on the basis of probability, it said.

 As for Kumar, the ATR said that two of the seven cases against him did not relate to the 1984 riots and the rest lacked evidence. Therefore, there could be no reason to reopen any of the cases.

 Green bench nod for canal project

 Chennai (PTI): The Centre has received 

 environmental clearance for the Rs 2,000-crore Sethusamudram 

 ship canal project, Union shipping minister T.R. Baalu said 

 on Wednesday.

 ?We have received the environmental clearance for the Sethusamudram project,? Baalu told reporters here.

 The project, which involves setting up a navigable route linking Palk Bay and the Gulf of Mannar through Adam?s bridge, will now be placed before the Union cabinet for its approval, Baalu said.

 The minister said the project would also have to get clearances from the public investment board, the finance ministry and the Planning Commission.

 Baalu said all aspect of the impact of the project on the environment has been taken into consideration.

 The Tuticorin Port Trust, the nodal agency for implementing the project, had asked the Nagpur-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute to conduct a study on the environmental impact of the project.

 Currently, ships going from west to east and from Tuticorin port to the east have to sail around Sri Lanka, entailing an additional distance of more than 254 to 424 nautical miles and 21 to 36 hours of sailing time. The Sethusamudram project will address this problem, officials said.

 New Delhi (PTI): Union home minister 

 Shivraj Patil will on Thursday launch the second phase of

 The office of the registrar general had launched the first phase of the campaign last year. About 3.4 crore birth certificates had been issued against about 14.4 crore births registered in the last decade.

 The focus of the second phase would be to ensure that the particulars of date and place of birth of children getting admitted to schools are entered in school records based on the birth certificate, an official release said.

 There are about 10 crore children born during 1994-2003 whose births have not been registered. In addition, there are about 7 crore children whose births were registered but do not have birth certificates.

 ?The campaign would be targeted to benefit these children,? the release said.

 Old turf pangs for hockey cadets

 Rourkela, April 26: Sixteen-year-old Anil Kullu would not like to remember the experience of playing at the sub-junior national hockey tournament at Imphal in February.

 Though hockey is in his blood and soul, the lad from the state-run Panposh Sports Hostel in Rourkela found it difficult to adjust to the astroturf at Imphal. He fell down several times and seemed to be ill at ease with the turf. As expected, the sports hostel team did not progress beyond the quarter-finals.

 The Imphal meet wasn?t Kullu?s first brush with astroturf ? he had practised on one at the sports hostel. 

 But, a visit to the hostel will reveal the sorry state the ground is in at present. Five years have passed since its expiry but the players still have to slug it out on the unplayable turf. Little wonder then that the likes of Kullu, for want of proper practice, could not cope with the astroturf at Imphal.

 With the synthetic bristles wearing off, the turf is now an ordinary ground where playing hockey means aching kneecaps and calf muscles.

 Not too long ago, the hostel was a name to reckon with in Indian hockey. Started in 1985, it was successful in tapping the talent of tribal youths of Sundargarh. The centre which gave Indian hockey stars like Lazarus Barla, Probodh Tirkey, Ignace Tirkey and woman players like Jyoti Sunita Kullu, is a shadow of what it was owing primarily to the absence of a new astroturf, an essential part of modern hockey. Indian skipper Dilip Tirkey, though not a student of the hostel, often used to practise there.

 ?Hockey on astroturf is a different ball game. Our weaknesses were exposed as we did not get proper practice,? said Kullu, who had also taken part in the 2002 sub-junior nationals in Bangalore.

 ?The players have been practising on the grass field for the past two years. The astroturf has become unplayable. So, the players have no option but to play on grass, which is useless in modern hockey,? says K.C. Chaudhury, one of the coaches at the hostel. 

 Lack of practice led to defeats at the hands of less-fancied teams from West Bengal and Karnataka in the senior national tournament at Hyderabad in March. The team?s performance was so poor that it was eliminated even before the knockout stage. 

 First laid in 1992, the astroturf should have been taken off and a new one re-laid in 2000 as the life of the surface is about eight years.

 The government last year floated a tender, which was later cancelled for reasons unknown. It has floated another tender this year. ?We have limited resources but are trying to re-lay a new turf,? said sports minister Debasish Nayak.

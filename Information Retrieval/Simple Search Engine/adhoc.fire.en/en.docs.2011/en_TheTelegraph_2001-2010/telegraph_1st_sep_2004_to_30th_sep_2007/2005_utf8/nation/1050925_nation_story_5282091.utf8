 Spy protest

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: The BJP has decided to put its internal squabbles behind and don the mantle of a serious Opposition party, reports our special correspondent. 

 The issue it picked for the makeover was the alleged KGB funding of Congress and CPI leaders when Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister. 

 From tomorrow, the party will launch a weeklong countrywide agitation that will be led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani.

 Under the slogan of Congress-communist jawab do, the BJP will hold rallies, demonstrations and sit-ins and demand a probe into the allegations.

 While Vajpayee, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Arun Jaitley will address a meeting here, Advani could use his visit to Somnath to make the point on the KGB issue.

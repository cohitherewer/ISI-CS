 Long-reign Chawla in Tandon seat

 R. VENKATARAMAN AND PTI

 New Delhi, May 14: Information and broadcasting secretary Naveen Chawla was appointed election commissioner today to fill the vacancy created by the elevation of B.B. Tandon as chief election commissioner.

 Chawlas appointment was cleared by the Prime Minister and has been approved by the President, official sources said.

 Chawla is a 1969 batch IAS officer who was due to retire in June. Now, he would have a five-year tenure in the three-member commission.

 Tandon will be chief election commissioner for a year. He will be followed by Gopalaswamy, who is eligible for a two-year stint at the seat.

 Thereafter, Chawla will have a tenure of two years as poll panel chief, beginning from 2008. If the present Lok Sabha completes its five-year term, he will conduct the next general elections.

 Tandon and Chawla are set to take up their new jobs from Monday.

 Petition wave

 The chief election commissioner-designates alleged derogatory comments against Yadavs have prompted a spate of petitions against him. 

 A Yadav group is seeking directives to restrain the government from appointing Tandon the poll panel chief.

 The All India Yadav Maha Sabha has filed a petition in Delhi High Court which will come up for hearing on May 17, a day after Tandon takes charge.

 Sabha president D. Nagendhiran said: May 16 will be observed as Protest Day by the sabha.

 He said Yadavs of the world will unite to burn the effigies of Tandon and N. Gopalaswamy, the other election commissioner who has been accused by L.V. Saptharishi, the observer for the Chhapra Lok Sabha elections, of making casteist remarks against the Yadavs.

 Sabha secretary Ashok Yadav said petitions were moved in the high courts of Madras, Andhra Pradesh, Patna, Allahabad and Karnataka besides the one in Delhi.

 Counsel for the sabha Anand Yadav said the prayer was the same in all the petitions.

 The sabha wants a thorough inquiry into the episode by an independent agency and says that till its outcome, the government should be restrained from appointing Tandon the poll panel chief.

 Even if Tandon is made the poll panel boss, it would be a case of lespendis ? meaning even if Tandon is appointed it would depend on the outcome of the plea, Anand Yadav said. If the petition succeeds it would mean Tandon has to be removed and his appointment would be deemed not to have been effected at all, he said.

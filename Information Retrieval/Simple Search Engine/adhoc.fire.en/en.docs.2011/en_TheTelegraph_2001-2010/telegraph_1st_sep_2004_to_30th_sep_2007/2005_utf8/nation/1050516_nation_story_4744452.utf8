 Judicial penal changes in the works 

 New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): The government, after introducing a new method of evaluating the performance of IAS officers, has decided to enact a law to ensure accountability of judges and discipline erring judicial officers.

 The new legislation ? part of efforts to reform the administration ? will be framed by making amendments in the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, official sources said here today, adding that the process for its enactment will start soon.

 The act will make it easier to take action against a judge. At present, a complex and long-drawn process is required to remove judges.

 (However, the changes are expected to cover only those till the level of district judges. Higher judges, especially those of the Supreme Court, are likely to be out of the purview of the amendment, adds our legal correspondent.)

 A judge against whom prima facie evidence of an illegal act is found would be asked not to attend court, pending inquiry, the sources said. If a judge is found guilty, he will be asked to put in his papers and would be removed if he does not do so, they said.

 The law will also have a provision for a committee of judges to investigate complaints against a judicial officer, the sources said.

 The draft of the amendment will soon be circulated among members of the cabinet, Opposition leaders and the chief justice of India.

 The aim of enacting the law is to rein in erring judges and maintain the respectability of the judiciary, the sources said. The move is part of the Centres plans to reform all systems of administration and governance and comes in the wake of the judiciary being recently rocked by incidents of alleged corruption and indiscipline.

 The judiciary was shaken when a Delhi High Court judge was accused of taking money and other favours for passing judgements.

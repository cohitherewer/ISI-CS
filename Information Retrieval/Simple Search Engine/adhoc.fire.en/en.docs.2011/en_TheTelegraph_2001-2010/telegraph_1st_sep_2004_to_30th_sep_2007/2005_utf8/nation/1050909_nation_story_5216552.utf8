 Paswan goes his own way, CPI in tow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Unfazed by the Congresss ultimatum to him to quit the UPA if he fights the Bihar elections outside the alliance, Ram Vilas Paswan today announced the formation of a separate political front for the polls.

 His Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) will not join the Congress-RJD alliance in Bihar. The CPI, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) and the Forward Bloc will be its allies.

 After an hour-long meeting with CPI national secretary D. Raja this afternoon, Paswan said he is also talking to the Samajwadi Party and the CPI(ML). We believe that these parties will also join our secular front and help end 15 years of misrule in Bihar, the LJP chief said.

 Raja warned the Congress against using the language of ultimatums. They have a bigger responsibility. They should tread carefully. The Congress should do nothing to push Paswan out. Such language will only create fissures within the UPA, he said.

 The LJP leader dismissed suggestions that he may have to quit the UPA after forming a separate front. I had a detailed and cordial discussion with Soniaji yesterday. I will not talk about what she said to me. I can only tell you that my impression is not that the Congress wants me to leave the UPA. In fact, the word ultimatum was not uttered even once, Paswan said.

 He said the UPA is a national-level alliance and has no relation with state politics. 

 The situation in each state is different. Didnt the Congress join us last time against the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar? Where was the UPA then? In Bengal and Kerala, the Congress and the Left will fight each other. That does not mean that there is any threat to the UPA at the Centre, Paswan said.

 The CPI, said Raja, is in complete agreement with Paswan on this issue. The reported ultimatums have no meaning. The UPA was formed as a specific response to the political situation that emerged during and after the parliamentary polls. The equations are different in the states. We will contest (the) Bihar elections with the LJP, the RSP and the Forward Bloc. Discussions are also on with the CPI(ML) and SP (Samajwadi Party), Raja said.

 The two leaders said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan was engaged in detailed discussions on seat-sharing and related issues with LJP leaders in Patna. 

 He will make a formal announcement about our alliance in Patna simultaneously, Raja said.

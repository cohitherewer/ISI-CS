 Rebel-wary Centre shy on Telengana 

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, April 17: The United Progressive Alliance government is unlikely to concede to the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh to carve out a separate Telengana state as the move would boost Maoists? bid to tighten their grip over the new state.

 The worries surfaced even as a subcommittee tasked to look into all aspects of the Telengana demand, headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, met for the first time on Friday.

 The entire region, barring Hyderabad, is infested with Maoists.

 The Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief and Union labour minister, K. Chandrashekhar Rao, and the minister of state for rural development, A. Narendra, gave a presentation to the subcommittee to buttress their demand for a separate state, while a few groups argued against the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.

 The three-member subcommittee, which also includes rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, was set up in January following threats by the TRS to pull out of the governments in Delhi and Andhra.

 The labour minister had recently said that if the Centre did not announce something positive before April 27, the foundation day of the TRS, he may have to withdraw support to the Congress-led government at the Centre.

 Earlier this month, Rao was held talks with Congress president Sonia Gandhi?s political secretary Ahmed Patel and Mukherjee, who agreed to convene a meeting of the subcommittee on April 15.

 After the meeting, Mukherjee said he would prepare a report and submit it to the government within two to three weeks for consideration. The committee will also have to consult various political parties before submitting its report. The CPM, the Telugu Desam Party and the Congress are opposed to a separate state while the BJP is ambivalent.

 The TRS chief expressed confidence that a separate Telengana state would become a reality soon. The ?common minimum programme had made a commitment towards a Telengana state and we will get it?, he said after the meeting.

 However, sources in the ruling alliance said the government would only drag the issue. The Congress is also opposed to the idea as it would alienate its supporters in the remaining part of Andhra.

 Maoist intrusion

 Several Maoists have crossed into Uttaranchal from Nepal, sending alarm bells ringing in the hill state. 

 Uttaranchal chief minister N.D. Tiwari has said the declaration of emergency in Nepal has resulted in many rebels crossing into the state for shelter while ISI modules have surfaced quite frequently at places of pilgrimage. Special efforts have been made to contain inter-state crime, he said.

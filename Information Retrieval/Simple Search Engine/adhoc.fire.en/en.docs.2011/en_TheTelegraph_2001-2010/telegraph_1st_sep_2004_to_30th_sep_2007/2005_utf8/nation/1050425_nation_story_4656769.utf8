 Medical strike to spread wings

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 24: Four days after doctors of SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack struck work in protest against the killing of a colleague, their counterparts at Burla-based VSS Medical College and Hospital and Berhampur-based MKCG Medical College and Hospital seem to be following suit.

 Since Thursday, 240 junior doctors of the Cuttack hospital have been on a strike. They have demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the family of Arun Kumar, the student from Kerala who was killed by a stray bullet on April 18, as well as a judicial probe. 

 President of the junior doctors? association Debasish Marandi said medical students of the Berhampur and Burla colleges would join the strike from tomorrow. Yesterday, they wore black badges to express their solidarity with their counterparts in Cuttack.

 The agitating junior doctors yesterday met health and family welfare minister Bijayashree Routray to press their demands. The talks, however, did not yield any result.

 Director-general of police Bipin Bihari Mishra, who met the medical students at his office, told them that he has asked the Cuttack superintendent of police to submit a report within 72 hours. 

 Meanwhile, police claimed to have successfully cracked the murder of two contractors in Bhubaneswar. ?We have solved the case by arresting the two culprits who masterminded the murder,? Bhubaneswar superintendent of police Amitabh Thakur said. The police presented the two accused, Artatrana Pradhan and Guna Lenka, with their faces wrapped in towels. A payment dispute was believed to be the reason behind the murder.

 Civil contractors Subash Dash and Dhirendra Sethi were gunned down in the city by five men on April 18, hours before Kumar was killed in Cuttack.

 A team led by Thakur arrested Lenka and Pradhan from a dhaba near Uttara Square around 9 pm on Friday by a team led by Thakur, said deputy inspector-general (Bhubaneswar range) S.K. Upadhyay. The team also recovered a pistol and a country-made revolver from the accused.

 Burn waste oil containers: SC

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered destruction 

by incineration of 133 containers of hazardous waste oil lying at Jawaharlal Nehru 

port, Mumbai, reports our legal correspondent.

 A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and S.H. Kapadia issued the order on a petition by the Research Foundation for Science contending that huge amount of waste oil of hazardous nature was being dumped in India, in violation of anti-dumping rules.

 Justice Sabharwal, writing the judgment for the bench, applied the ?polluter pays? rule to levy the cost of incineration on the importers and directed that a monitoring committee set up by it, supervise the exercise. The apex court directed all the authorities concerned to extend ?full cooperation?.

 The bench also asked the committee to file a compliance report. 

 The court also directed the customs department to furnish within four weeks details of the importers of another set of 170 such containers lying at Navasheva port in Maharashtra, so that appropriate orders could be passed.

 Aitraaz in spot over scene

Jabalpur (PTI): A Madhya Pradesh High Court bench has issued 

notices to the Central Film Censor Board, producer Subhash Ghai and director Abbas 

Mastan over an ?objectionable scene? in the film Aitraaz.

 The bench of Chief Justice R.V. Raveendran and Justice S.S. Kemkar asked the respondents to file replies within two weeks after hearing a public interest litigation on Tuesday filed by advocates M.M. Jaiswal and R.K. Pandey.

 The advocates petitioned that in the movie, also starring Priyanka Chopra (picture right), actor Annu Kapoor is shown consuming alcohol in an advocate?s uniform, which was against the advocates? act and amounted to contempt of court.

 The court, in the last hearing of the petition on December 24, had directed the Madhya Pradesh Bar Association secretary, Sunil Chaubey, to see the picture and submit a report.

 Chaubey in his report said the scenes were objectionable and amounted to contempt of court.

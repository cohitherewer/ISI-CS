 Centre to bear video trial bill

 New Delhi, July 31 (PTI): Delhi High Court has said the government will foot the bill for videoconferencing to record the testimony of a foreign witness unwilling to come to India for deposition.

 Since it is a court proceeding and for all intents and purposes the venue (where) the witnesses would be examined through videoconferencing channels would be a court, it is the duty of the state to bear those expenses, Justice R.S. Sodhi said.

 The court, however, made it clear that it will be the responsibility of the accused person to pay for and bring the witnesses he chooses to examine at the venue.

 The order came on a revision petition filed by Turkish national Tuncay Alankus, ho had challenged a CBI special court order asking him to bear the expense of videoconference to examine certain defence foreign witnesses in the Rs 133-crore urea scam case.

 CBI counsel Sanjay Jain had said in godman Chandraswamis case, the Supreme Court had held that the defence should bear its own expenses.

 But Justice Sodhi said: It appears that the expenses borne by the defence in that case were a concession made by the accused. The judgment does not lay down (any) law.

 Allowing the petition, the high court also permitted Alankus to examine 21 defence witnesses in addition to the seven allowed by the special court. Alankuss counsel Harjinder Singh agreed not to seek any adjournments and make every effort to expeditiously examine witnesses following the trial courts schedule.

 The trial court had in December allowed Alankus and another Turkish accused, Cirhan Karanci to examine foreign witnesses through videoconferencing at their own expense.

 Lesson from bus: will shows the way

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Lahore, Feb. 17: When India and Pakistan want to do something they can come up with fairly creative solutions. The way found around passport-based travel to facilitate the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service is a prime example of their ingenuity.

 Travel within the Indian side of Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would be on the respective entry permits of the two countries. How would this come about? According to Indian officials accompanying external affairs minister Natwar Singh, the procedure would be as follows:

 Step 1: An Indian wishing to travel across the Line of Control (LoC) first makes an application to the ?designated authority? ? the regional passport office in Srinagar. 

 The application form will have all the details that are normally provided in a passport, including the photograph of the person wishing to travel.

 Step 2: The completed applications from the Indian side are then forwarded to the Pakistani immigration authorities across the LoC for ?pre-verification?. 

 They record the application details of those whom they wish to allow to visit their part of Kashmir and send the application forms back to Srinagar indicating those whose travel has been cleared. This process from application to approval for travel is expected to take two to three weeks.

 Step 3: Those cleared for travel buy tickets on an Indian bus travelling to the LoC crossing point. Once they cross the LoC, they present their approved application forms to the immigration authorities there. 

 An entry permit is then issued to them indicating the cities or towns they can visit. The entry permit entails police reporting in the specific cities and towns visited.

 Step 4: With entry permits in hand, the visitors board a Pakistani bus waiting across the LoC and go to Muzaffarabad.

 The same procedure would apply to those from Pakistan and the part of Kashmir under its occupation wishing to visit the other half of Kashmir in India.

 They would alight from a Pakistani bus coming from Muzaffarabad, cross the LoC, complete immigration procedure on the Indian side, get an entry permit and board an Indian bus going to Srinagar.

 Step 5: The Pakistani bus from Muzaffarabad and the Indian bus from Srinagar synchronise their departures to reach the border, crossing at the same time. This would mean a bus being available on both sides of the LoC for the passengers crossing over.

 In this manner, travel on either side of the LoC would be on the respective country?s documents ? an Indian entry permit on the Indian side and vice versa.

 The moral of this procedure ? bureaucrats when they are directed not to be obstructionists can be quite clever. That they end up generating additional paperwork is another matter.

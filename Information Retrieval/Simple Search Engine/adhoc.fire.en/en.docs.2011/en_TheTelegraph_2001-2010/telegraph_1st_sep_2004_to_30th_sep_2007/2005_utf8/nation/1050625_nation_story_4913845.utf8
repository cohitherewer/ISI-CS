 Congress plots Rahul entry

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, June 24: The AICC, which wants an early meeting to facilitate Rahul Gandhis election to the working committee but is clueless about Sonia Gandhis response, has left the final decision to the Congress chief.

 We have placed before the Congress president two options. She can wait until the mandatory Congress plenary session during which the working committee election is usually held or immediately convene an AICC session exclusively for the purpose of the election. We have left it to her to take a decision, said a party general secretary.

 The outgoing AICC general secretaries, party treasurer and working committee members holding charge of party affairs in states conveyed the options to Sonia today.

 The Congress chief can convene the AICC session any time after June 30 as the complete list of around 1,000 committee members would be ready by then. 

 Keen to bring Rahul into the working committee as an elected member, several AICC general secretaries have been running a campaign over the past few weeks for early polls by proposing an immediate AICC session. However, they are not sure if Sonia agrees with their plan.

 Kerala crown

 Sonia today picked Ramesh Chennithala to head the faction-ridden Kerala unit, ahead of the crucial Assembly polls early next year.

 Sonia nominated Chennithala after the Kerala unit authorised the Congress president to appoint a new person to the top post.

 Delhi quake map

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 23: A narrow strip of exposed rock that cuts through the capital making an inverted Y may be the safest place to be in when an earthquake rattles north India, scientists said today.

 Densely-populated chunks of east Delhi lying on soft soil and shallow groundwater are among the most vulnerable areas for damage, the scientists said, as they released maps marking the citys high-risk zones for earthquake impact.

 The department of science and technology released what scientists call a first-level seismic hazard microzonation map of Delhi ? identifying areas where earthquakes are likely to have high impacts because of local soil characteristics. 

 Such maps will help in identification of buildings that would need retrofitting to protect them from the hazards of earthquakes, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said.

 The project is part of a larger national effort to classify cities in earthquake-prone regions into microzones that represent different risk levels. 

 A map for Jabalpur is ready and other cities will be taken up over time, Sibal said.

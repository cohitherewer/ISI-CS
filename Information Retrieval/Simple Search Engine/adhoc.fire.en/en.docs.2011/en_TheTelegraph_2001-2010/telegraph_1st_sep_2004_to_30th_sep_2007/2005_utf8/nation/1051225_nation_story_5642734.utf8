 Port Blair, Dec. 24: Car Nicobar was flooded and Lieutenant Commander Anil Kumar Singhs brief was to find out what had happened.

 He did very soon, and the memory has stayed with him.

 It was a horrifying experience staring at death from close quarters, recalled the first pilot who flew to Campbell Bay the day the tsunami struck the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and brought the news of the devastation to the world.

 So many human beings pleading for help.... I remember dumping fuel into the sea and rescuing 27 persons, mostly children, and bringing them to safety.

 Today, two days before the anniversary, Singh believes he has emerged stronger, more confident and capable of taking on any challenge.

 The devastation he saw that morning was unlike anything Singh had ever come across.

 The radio crackled as the Dornier flew over Car Nicobar. We have lost about eight officers it seems? several are dead and water is coming in from all sides. It was around 11 and the voice at the other end was of station commander K.K. Bandyopadhyay from Carnic, as Car Nicobar is called locally.

 I was clueless, but soon realised the devastation, Singh recalled. He did not land in Carnic but went to Campbell Bay, more than 200 km away, where he helped the 27 on to his four-seater Dornier.

 Since that morning, Singh has been on several missions to the emerald isles and has seen how the topography of the land has changed.

 It is not a welcome anniversary. As the day approaches, I pray to God that such a disaster never hits mankind, said Brigadier J.M. Devadoss, the army component commander of the Andaman and Nicobar Command.

 Devadoss, who was on a Chennai-bound Indian Airlines flight on December 26 last year, rushed to nearby Tambaram to reach the emerald islands immediately after he heard the news.

 When I finally reached Carnic that day, I could see an ocean of human beings. It was like Ashoka looking at the end of the Kalinga war, he said.

 He and his men soon joined the rescue efforts. If we had an early warning system in place, many lives would have been saved. I have spent 30 years in service, but this experience has changed me completely, Devadoss said.

 Lieutenant Commander Anup Kumar had a different kind of experience when he flew his helicopter to an island. He took his Chetak to an island called Chowra but could not find anybody at first. There was nobody, not even a dog in sight, the Lieutenant Commander said.

 A year on, Kumar, who later rescued 35 people in a single day from that island, says he is eager to take up rescue missions. After such devastation, I itch to help people in distress, he said.

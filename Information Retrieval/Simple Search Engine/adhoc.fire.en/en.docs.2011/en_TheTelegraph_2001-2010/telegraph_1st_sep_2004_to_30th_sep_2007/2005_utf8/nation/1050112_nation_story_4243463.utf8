 Paswan ready for lone poll battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 11: A day after the Janata Dal (United) said the NDA?s doors were open for the Lok Janshakti Party, Ram Vilas Paswan said here today that there was no change in his anti-BJP stance.

 Paswan said the LJP would go it alone and field candidates in all 243 constituencies of Bihar.

 ?I have been saying it right from the beginning that my party will have nothing to do with the BJP. With the JD (U) announcing that it would contest with the BJP, things have become very clear. We will walk alone,? Paswan said.

 Apart from its supposed Dalit vote-base, the LJP has been largely focusing on the minority and upper caste electorate for next month?s polls. Paswan has been touring the state for several weeks now and his election meetings have received positive response.

 The Union minister, however, has been attacking the Rashtriya Janata Dal much more vehemently than the NDA. The LJP had contested the Lok Sabha elections in alliance with the RJD and the Congress.

 Three days ago, Paswan appealed to the Congress and the JD (U) to join hands with his party and even said he was not interested in becoming chief minister. But while the JD (U) continues to be an ally of the BJP, the Congress looks set to go with the RJD.

 The Congress is determined to bargain hard with the RJD so as to get a good number of seats this time. 

 Paswan?s determination to go it alone has dealt a blow to the JD (U)?s hopes of convincing the LJP to have an open or tacit understanding with the BJP. JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar has held several rounds of talks with Paswan but his stand on the BJP has spoiled all efforts for an alliance.

 ?We expect to do well and our campaign has received good support across Bihar,? an LJP functionary said.

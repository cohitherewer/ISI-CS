 Bihar ?hero? in relief muddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 27: The Bihar administration today nearly admitted that its records reveal a large sum of unaccounted money was paid from the Patna district magistrate?s office, giving fillip to allegations of a ?scandal? in the flood relief operations last year.

 Patna district magistrate Sudhir Kumar, who succeeded the controversial Gautam Goswami, said his records show the presence of bills for only Rs 7.70 crore while payments of over Rs 17 crore are unaccounted for.

 Goswami, who submitted his resignation from the IAS to the state government and proceeded to join the Sahara group as a vice-president just before the Assembly elections, has now been sucked into the scandal. Goswami was featured as a Young Asian Hero by Time magazine.

 The money was allegedly paid to a fake company with the same initials (BSSIC) as the Bihar State Small Industries Corporation through a local bank. The account today has little money.

 Goswami is still to be relieved from the IAS and the possibilities of action against him are open. He had resigned after being pulled up by the Election Commission in the run-up to the polls.

 Governor Buta Singh today said the matter would be investigated and he could refer it to the CBI if the vigilance department is not able to do a satisfactory job. Singh said if required, Goswami would be called for interrogation. 

 In a statement last night, Goswami had said Rs 5 crore was re-routed because adequate money was not released to his district for flood relief but maintained that everything was done with the knowledge of ?senior authorities?.

 All work carried for flood relief in July-August 2004 was ?teamwork? in which several officers, including the chief secretary, were associated, he said.

 On the allegation of pilferage of funds for procurement of relief material from the BSSIC, Goswami said tenders had been issued and all payments were made by account-payee cheques through the bank to the persons authorised by the corporation.

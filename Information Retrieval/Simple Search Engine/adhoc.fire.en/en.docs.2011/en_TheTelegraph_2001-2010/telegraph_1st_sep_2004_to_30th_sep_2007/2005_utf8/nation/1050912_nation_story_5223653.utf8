 CWC falls into Sonias lap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: State Congress units have started adopting resolutions authorising Sonia Gandhi to constitute a new working committee by nominating members, as it appears likely that the partys scheduled plenary session will be deferred.

 The Mumbai regional Congress committee was the first to pass a resolution and forward it to the Congress president. While authorising Sonia to nominate the working committee members, the resolution also urged her to include Rahul Gandhi as a member.

 Following the Mumbai Congresss resolution, the Maharashtra, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh units, too, adopted resolutions authorising Sonia to constitute the partys highest executive body. 

 Bengal Congress unit chief Pranab Mukherjee tonight said a large number of AICC members from the state had sent a memorandum to the partys election committee authorising Sonia to constitute the working committee.

 The resolution by the partys Andhra Pradesh committee has urged all other state units to adopt resolutions to enable Sonia to expeditiously constitute the working committee.

 The moves to adopt the resolutions assumed significance as the leadership has more or less concluded that it would have to postpone the party plenary session it had scheduled at Hyderabad between October 20 and 22 because of the Bihar Assembly polls.

 The sources, however, said a final decision on postponing the plenary is yet to be taken, as the party is still awaiting a communication from the Election Commission on its plea to reschedule the Bihar polls. 

 The postponement would mean not only a delay in constituting the working committee but also in setting up a new team of AICC office-bearers. The term of the present working committee and AICC team has ended with the re-election of Sonia as party chief in May.

 According to the partys constitution, on the last day of the plenary session, half of the working committees 23 members have to be elected by newly-elected AICC members. Thereafter, the remaining members are nominated by the party president, which paves the way for her to choose a new team of AICC office-bearers.

 Normally, the plenary session is held within six months of the party organisational elections. Because of the announcement of the Bihar Assembly poll schedule, we may not be able to hold the session until December-January. In such a situation, it would be better not to delay constituting the working committee and the new team of office-bearers, a party leader said.

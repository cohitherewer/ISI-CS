 Rabri holds CM home

 ASHISH SINHA

 Rabri Devis 

 nameplate at the secretariat is replaced with that of 

 Governor Buta Singh on Tuesday. On the first day of 

 Presidents rule, both Maoists and police carried 

 out raids in different parts of the state. The rebels 

 struck in Rohtas district, kidnapping 10 villagers who 

 had refused to pay extortion money. Six of them were 

 later released.

 Police raided Gaya divisional jail and seized Rs 10,000 

 from RJD legislator and former minister Surendra Prasad 

 Yadav, imprisoned in a criminal case. 

 Three wanted criminals were arrested in swoops at Gaya 

 and Bhojpur. Sources in the police headquarters said 

 patrolling has been intensified across the state.

Patna, March 8: Former 

 chief minister Rabri Devi does not seem keen to quit 1 Anne 

 Marg, her family home of 15 years, and the law is on her 

 side.

 Nor does her husband Laloo Prasad Yadav look eager to vacate 5 Desh Ratna Marg, allotted to him in his capacity as a former chief minister. The sprawling bungalows, long Bihar?s power centres, are adjacent and interconnected.

 The law permits a former chief 

 minister to occupy a government bungalow even after demitting 

 office if he has completed a full term. Both Rabri Devi 

 and Laloo Prasad qualify. The advantage with 1 Anne Marg 

 is it is not the official residence of the chief minister.

 It was the Rashtriya Janata Dal regime that coined this law. No other former chief minister ? Jagannath Mishra, Ramsundar Das or Nitish Kumar ? qualifies for the amenities that include security and personal staff.

 But the hustle and bustle at 1 Anne Marg ? kicked up by an army of supporters, politicians and waiting media crew -? have died down. Even snack vendors who used to set up shop in front of the bungalow are scouting for finer spots. ?Business was roaring during the elections and normal before that. Aaj to kucch bikri hua hi nahi. I am planning to return to my village in Uttar Pradesh. Power gaya to sab gaya,? said Ramjatan Yadav, a vendor.

 Entry to Anne Marg has become easy as barricades have been removed. A large number of visitors showed up today. But entry to the bungalow was restricted though guards were fewer.

 But while Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi can still enjoy their homes minus the crown, things will be tougher for Rabri Devi?s brothers, Sadhu and Subhash Yadav. Both were given sprawling bungalows in the vicinity after they became MPs.

 But orders are now being processed to get the ?illegally occupied? bungalows ? MPs cannot be allotted houses in Patna ? vacated, government sources said.

 The change of guard has brought in corresponding changes at the secretariat as well. The smell of fresh paint wafted in the air today. Masons and painters were busy even on Shivratri, in a hurry to finish the changeover job.

 Most marked was the makeover at the chief minister?s office. ?We have replaced the old name and designation plates. You can see the chamber now belongs to Sardar Buta Singh, the governor. We will soon fix the Urdu name plate ? there was a spelling mistake in the one that we got this morning,? said an employee. ?For us this is routine. But we are performing the routine after a long time. During the Congress?s days, chief ministers used to change at a much faster rate and so would the name plates.? 

 Chambers occupied by at least three senior ministers ?Jagdanand Singh, Ashok Kumar and Abdul Bari Siddiqui ? are also being done up. They are likely to be occupied by the governor?s advisers.

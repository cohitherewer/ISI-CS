 Charges framed on rape cop

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 12: Mumbai police today filed a chargesheet against constable Sunil More, accused of raping a college student inside the Marine Drive police post in April. 

 Six charges have been slapped on More.

 The constable was arrested by Marine Drive police after an 18-year-old complained that he had raped her in a drunken state inside the police post on April 21. The case sparked public furore in Mumbai and dented the polices image.

 The chargesheet mentions action against More under Sections 376 (rape), 376 (B) (intercourse by a public servant with a woman in his custody), 354 (outraging a womans modesty), 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. 

 The court adjourned the hearing on Mores bail application till July 14.

 It took the police nearly three months to file a chargesheet against More, despite intense pressure from womens organisations. Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy had dismissed More from service by invoking powers under Article 311 of the Indian Constitution. 

 More has undergone a third DNA test after the first two were inconclusive in proving the rape charge.

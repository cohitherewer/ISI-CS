 Twin ammo in BJP kitty

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 20: Bihar and Aligarh provided fresh ammunition to the BJP to attack the United Progressive Alliance government two days before it completes its first year in office.

 Bihar, because the two handpicked officials of the Election Commission posted in Siwan and Gopalganj were shunted out and the former chief secretary, Arun Pathak, believed to be a Laloo Prasad Yadav loyalist, was appointed adviser to governor Buta Singh. 

 Aligarh, because the government cleared a 50 per cent reservation quota for Muslims for postgraduate courses in the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).

 The anti-Laloo Prasad rhetoric apart, the main political point the BJP sought to make through the Bihar issue was to play up the Laloo Prasad-Ram Vilas Paswan differences on the administrative decisions.

 BJP vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu today claimed he saw in the developments a window of opening for the formation of a government in the state if Paswan felt he was pushed to the wall and ought to part company from the UPA. 

 At this rate, there will be an anti-Laloo, anti-Congress government soon in Bihar, said Naidu. He demanded that transfers and postings should be suspended until popular rule was reinstated in Bihar.

 On the AMU reservation, he said the BJP may consider challenging the order in a court of law. But he did not indicate if the party would take to the streets, not even in Uttar Pradesh, though the issue-strapped state BJP was reportedly keen to stage protests.

 Paswan-Laloo rift

 Paswan today asked the UPA not to treat Laloo Prasad with kid gloves.

 The Lok Janshakti Party chief made it clear that he will not yield to the Rashtriya Janata Dal president even if there is a Janata Dal (United) waiting in the wings to poach on his 29 MLAs. 

 Laloo Prasad Yadav is like a blot on the moon. The UPA government should remove him, he said at a meeting organised in the capital by an Urdu literary magazine.

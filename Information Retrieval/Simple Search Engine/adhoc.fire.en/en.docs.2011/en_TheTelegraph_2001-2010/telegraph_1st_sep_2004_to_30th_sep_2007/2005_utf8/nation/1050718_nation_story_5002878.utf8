 Rina Kumari: Class of 85

 Raxaul, July 17: Rina Kumari, the girl from a colony for leprosy patients in Sunderpore who graduated in pharmacy from the University of Sunderland this week, was one of a batch of five at her first school.

 The little blossom from Bihars Little Flower Leprosy Mission school has bloomed in faraway Britain, but her four classmates have stayed closer home. 

 Muhammad Ahmad Ansari, who was with Rina in the batch of 1985, remembers her fondly. Rina has been and still is a very understanding and helpful girl and quite sympathetic to us, the less fortunate ones, he said.

 Of course she was smarter than me, and we spent hours together in the quarters of our headmaster Ravindra Singh, learning math and science from him. He had a special love for us, recalled Ansari, who after his B.Com chose to serve the organisation that runs his first alma mater. 

 Rina was spotted by Lady Patsy Puttnam, wife of the chancellor of the University of Sunderland, in school in 1994 and followed her to Britain as her adopted daughter. Her education was sponsored by the couple.

 Lady Puttnam was visiting charities in India, one of which happened to be the Little Flower Mission, when she met Rina. The girl had come to live in the colony at Sunderpore in Raxaul after the family was driven out of their village because her father had developed leprosy. 

 Ansari, who is now married and a father of two, still remembers Rinas words just before she left the colony. I will never forget you, please tell me if you need anything and I will help you.

 Jaishankar, another classmate, has no special memories but said he wished her the best. Let her shine more, if she is capable. Fortune has come her way. Maybe if that English couple had wanted a boy, I would have been chosen. Bad luck. Everything has a time. How I wish I had become a scientist, he said. 

 Jaishankar did not complete his BSc at Delhi University and is now the marketing officer for the colonys huge handloom section. Dilip, the third boy in Rinas class, is an LIC agent in Raxaul. The only other girl in the class, Sita Devi, has been working in the handloom section for six years. She has lost touch with Rina and did not know of her graduation.

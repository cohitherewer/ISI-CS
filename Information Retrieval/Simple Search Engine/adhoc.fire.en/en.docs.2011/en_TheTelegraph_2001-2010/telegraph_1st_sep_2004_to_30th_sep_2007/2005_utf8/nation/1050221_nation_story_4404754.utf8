 Ahmedabad, Feb. 20: Several Hindus actively participated in a tazia procession taken out today by 30 riot-affected families of Naroda gam, in what looks like the first sign of reconciliation in this communally-polarised city.

 Volunteers of the Aman Samuday, a non-government organisation, had fanned out across the city to urge Hindus to join the procession.

 There was fear of trouble in the walled-city areas where a tazia procession was to be taken out and ?our volunteers had gone to these localities to mobilise people to participate in the procession?, said Jakia Johwer, who works for the Aman Samuday, floated by NGO Action Aid to bridge the communal divide.

 The efforts did make a difference in Naroda gam, where peace volunteers ensured that Hindus not only watch the procession but also generously donated, said Maulana Ramzan Ali Sheikh of Naroda. Hindus from surrounding localities also came to watch the well-decorated tazia.

 Ali Sheikh said this is a small gesture on the part of the Hindus but is a ?good beginning?, considering the turbulent past and the strained relations between the two communities. He believed that this would go a long way in bringing down the barriers between the communities.

 Johwer shared the optimism. ?For the first time, three years after the riots we are seeing the visible change,? he said.

 Twelve people were killed in Naroda gam, near Naroda-Patia, on February 28, 2001. Only 30 of the 130 families that used to live here remain. The others have shifted to Muslim dominated localities such as Juhapura and Bapunagar.

 ?However, Sunday was a special day for them. They all returned to take part in the tazia procession,? said Ali Sheikh.

 In keeping with tradition, a Hindu, Baba Narayan Sinh, led the procession. Sinh?s forefathers have been taking part in the processions since the Mughal period, said tazia committee president J.V. Momin. About 94 tazia processions were taken out from Jamalpur, Amraiwadi, Khanpur, Dandi Limda and other areas.

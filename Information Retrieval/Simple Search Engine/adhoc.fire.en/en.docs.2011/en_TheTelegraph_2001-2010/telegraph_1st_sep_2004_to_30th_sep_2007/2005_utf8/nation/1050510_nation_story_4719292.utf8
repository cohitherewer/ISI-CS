 Marriage seal in the works

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, May 9: Parliament may soon enact a law making registration of marriages compulsory.

 An indication was given today by solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati, who told a Supreme Court division bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and S.H. Kapadia that a separate law was necessary to give effect to compulsory registration of marriages. 

 However, the court asked the solicitor-general to get back to it after consulting the Centre on whether a directive could be issued to all states and Union territories to compulsorily register marriages till such a law is passed by Parliament.

 The direction came on a case in which an estranged woman contended that her husband could easily ?exploit? her as the marriage was not registered.

 The judges said: ?It appeared to us that in the absence of records relating to date of marriage and parties to marriage, problems come up, which have far reaching consequences. We, therefore, request the learned solicitor-general to consider whether government orders by way of executive instructions can be issued on the basis of direction of this court to various states and Union territories to authorise officials specifically to keep record of marriages so that they can be placed as evidence in different proceedings if the necessity arises.?

 The judges recorded the statement of the solicitor-general that ?there may be necessity of a suitable legislation in this regard as the government orders/executive instructions may not suffice?.

 ?We are of a view that until such a suitable legislation is made, the government orders/executive instructions can be made enforceable in terms of the orders of this court. These may be implemented where there is no statutory prescription for recording/registering the marriage and may be done as an additional measure when there is any such prescription,? the judges said in a two-page order in the case.

 Appointing senior counsel Ranjit Kumar as amicus curiae in the case, the court said the ?solicitor-general may also advise the states and Union territories to place their views before him and this court so that appropriate directions could be issued?.

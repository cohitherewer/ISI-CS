 Modi riots slur

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 3: The 2002 riots were ?state sponsored? and were ?orchestrated by chief minister Narendra Modi?, Haren Pandya, the slain Gujarat home minister, had told his father, according to a deposition before the Godhra inquiry commission.

 Vitthal Pandya today told the G.T. Nanavati commission that his son, then the state revenue minister, had information that Modi had ? at a meeting on February 27 at Lunawala in Panchmahal district ? instructed 55 BJP workers to fan out across the state to avenge the Godhra train burning. Riots broke out on February 28 in 16 of the state?s 25 districts.

 ?It was not a coincidence that the pattern of violence was similar everywhere,? he said.

 However, the commission refused to record Pandya?s ?opinionated statement? on the sequence of events. He has been called for cross-examination on February 21. Pandya has made no secret of his feelings for Modi, whom he holds responsible for his son?s assassination on March 26, 2003.

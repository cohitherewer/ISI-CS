 SC clears air on decree

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, May 23: The Supreme Court has ruled that the period of execution of a decree would commence from the date the order was passed by a court and not from when it was engrossed, or produced in its final form.

 The order came on an argument by one of the parties to a partition deed who claimed that as the decree was engrossed on stamp paper at a later date, it should be calculated from that day.

 The court said the start of the 12-year period of limitation ? the time beyond which an action may be defeated or a property right does not continue ? for executing a decree cannot be made to depend upon the date of engrossment of the decree.

 The engrossment of the decree on stamp paper would relax back to the date of the decree, a three-judge bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and G.P. Mathur said in their May 13 judgment.

 Justice Sabharwal, who wrote the judgment, said there was no statutory provision prescribing a time limit for furnishing the stamp paper for engrossing a decree. 

 Nor was there any time limit for engrossment of the decree on stamp paper or any statutory obligation on the court passing the decree to direct the parties to furnish the stamp paper, the judge added.

 But the judge said merely because there is no direction to furnish the stamp papers, it did not mean that a party could furnish them at its sweet will and claim that the limitation period, provided under Article 136 of the Limitation Act, starts from the date of engrossment.

 The court said the date of furnishing of stamp papers is uncertain, within the domain, purview and control of a party. But a party by his own act of not furnishing stamp paper cannot stop the running of (the) period of limitation, the bench said. None can take advantage of his own wrong.

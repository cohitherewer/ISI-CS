 Student riot over exam venue shift

 Etah (PTI): Thirteen students were arrested 

 for rioting after more than 200 of them went on a rampage, 

 damaging three buses and burning examination question papers 

 in Jalesar town of Uttar Pradesh.

 The students set up roadblocks and tried to prevent others from appearing for the examination on Tuesday after the vice-chancellor of Ambedkar University, A.S. Kukala, changed the examination venue, Jalesar circle officer Ashutosh Mishra said.

 Kukala had changed the centre due to alleged ?mass copying?. He refused to overturn the decision after a deputation of students approached him.

 Mishra said the students allegedly stopped a van carrying question papers and set fire to around 70,000 copies of the papers. They also pelted stones at buses, shattering the window-panes.

 The students were booked under various sections pertaining to rioting and arson.

 A contingent of the Provincial Armed Constabulary, five station house officers and 10 sub-inspectors were deployed at the examination venues to ensure law and order, Mishra added.

 Aim to uplift scavengers fail

 New Delhi (PTI): The Centre-sponsored 

 scheme to liberate and rehabilitate scavengers has failed 

 to achieve its objectives despite an investment of more 

 than Rs 620 crore, the public accounts committee told the 

 Lok Sabha.

 The 22-member committee is headed by BJP leader V.K. Malhotra.

 ?Divorcing liberation from rehabilitation was an error of judgement that weakened the foundation of the national scheme of liberation and rehabilitation of scavengers and their dependents and led to uncoordinated efforts without focus,? the committee report said.

 The scheme failed to enhance or re-orient the skill levels of beneficiaries necessary for a change in occupation. Absence of base-line survey, non-involvement of district development authorities and commercialisation of assistance patterns led to the loss of focus in monitoring the scheme, the report said. 

 The report described the achievements of the scheme as ?sporadic, uncoordinated and generally poor?.

 Acid thrown at schoolgirls

 Mumbai (PTI): Three schoolgirls received 

 burn injuries when a youth threw an acid-filled balloon 

 at them in the Chembur area. 

 The balloon was thrown at a Class VIII student of Loreto Convent while she was on her way to school. Two other students were also injured. The accused, an employee of a caterer, told police that he was instructed by his employer to do so, following arguments with the girl?s mother. The girls are out of danger, the police said.

 Assembly dharna

 Bangalore (PTI): The Opposition launched 

 a dharna in the Karnataka Assembly, flaying the government 

 for its failure to release adequate funds to provide drinking 

 water. Opposition members contended that local bodies and 

 district administrations lacked funds and were unable to 

 repair defunct borewells.

 Woman mauled 

 Srinagar (PTI): Villagers found the 

 half-eaten body of a pregnant woman in the Gulgam forest 

 area of Kupwara district on Tuesday. The villagers, who 

 launched a search for Shameema Begum, 22, suspect a leopard 

 might have attacked her when she had gone to the forest 

 to collect mushrooms. 

 Body found

 Bhavnagar (PTI): The body of a 14-year-old 

 girl was found with her hands and legs tied in the Bhavnagar 

 district of Gujarat. The girl?s father lodged a complaint 

 with police after she went missing on Tuesday. Police is 

 yet to determine if the girl was raped.

 Twin murders

 New Delhi (PTI): The bodies of two 

 elderly women, with multiple stab wounds, were found in 

 a flat near the Mukherjee Nagar area of the capital on Wednesday.

 Lightning deaths

 Midnapore/ Burdwan: In two incidents, 

 five persons were killed by lightning. On Tuesday night, 

 at Keyaboni, about 165 km from Calcutta, three persons standing 

 beneath a palm tree were hit by lightning. At Jamna, about 

 180 km from city, two more died. 

 To check the rapidly declining vulture population, the forest department of Gujarat will carry out a census which will study their nesting habits and set up a vulture care centre.

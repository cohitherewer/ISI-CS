 BJP follows Indira lead 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 4: It is the stuff Congress lore is made of. 

 In its heyday in Uttar Pradesh, the story goes that then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had decided the state must have a new chief minister. The late Rajendra Kumari Vajpeyi was chosen and asked to rush to Lucknow where she would be elected by the legislators and sworn in.

 As Vajpeyi waited at Delhi airport, there was an announcement asking her to meet the Prime Minister at her residence. A shock awaited her. She was told that N.D. Tiwari had been elected leader of the legislature party, so she need not go on with her trip.

 Veteran Congress members in the state traced the partys decline to episodes such as this one. The refrain was stifling democracy and the rights of the MLAs and MPs was the surest way of killing parties. But if the anointment of Shivraj Singh Chauhan as Madhya Pradeshs third chief minister in two years is a barometer, the BJP may well be leaving the original practitioner of the high command school of politics far behind. 

 Uma Bharti reinforced the point when she said: This is the first time in the history of Indias political parties that a parliamentary board has chosen the chief minister. Usually, someones name is suggested but it is announced only after the party elects a person.

 Congress sources said if a chief minister has to be replaced midway, the high command chooses a successor, but a meeting of the legislature party is de rigeur. 

 The BJP has not adhered to the basics in its constitution. In their zeal to prove their emergence as the nucleus of the new order and iterate their loyalty to the RSS that was ready to jettison Uma, the general secretaries made sure the veterans didnt have their way.

 A.B. Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh were reportedly keen to bring Uma back. Vajpayee thought she was the BJPs only leader in the state with a base among the backward castes and the adherents of Hindutva, while Advani wanted to put the Sangh down. Jaswant is spoiling for a change of guard in Rajasthan, but cannot be seen as part of a plan to get rid of one woman chief minister without bringing in another.

 But Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Rajnath Singh and Pramod Mahajan were united by their animosity towards Uma. For the BJPs second-rung leaders, Gujarat was a reminder of the perils of allowing charisma and electoral success to grow unchecked. Chief minister Narendra Modi, who has resisted several attempts to oust him, calls the shots vis-?-vis the capital. 

 The BJP leadership reckoned that its salvation lay not in promoting the likes of Modi but letting pliant chief ministers service their interests. 

 With the Centre out of its hands, the partys only hope is to rule the states by proxy as the Congress had done once.

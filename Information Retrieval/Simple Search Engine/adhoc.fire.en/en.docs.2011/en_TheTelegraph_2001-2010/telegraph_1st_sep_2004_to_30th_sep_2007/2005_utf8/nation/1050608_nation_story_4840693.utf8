 Poison alert for Punjab farmers

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, June 7: When they spray their fields with pesticides, Punjabs farmers virtually conduct chemical warfare against themselves, a study by a Delhi-based NGO has found.

 The Centre for Science and Environment has detected in the blood of the states farmers chemicals from six to 13 pesticides, in quantities up to 600 times the levels found in Americans. 

 If its Punjab today, tomorrow it could be Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Bihar. Regulation must begin immediately, the centres director, Sunita Narain, said. 

 The tests were undertaken following media reports of an increase in cancer cases in Punjab. But Narain could not link the pesticides (organochlorine and organophosphate) in the bloodstream with cancer as she wasnt sure exactly what harm they did to humans.

 Studies on animals show that even a single instance of low-level exposure to some organophosphates can cause changes in the brains chemistry. Early childhood exposure can lead to lasting effects on learning, attention and behaviour.

 The study, conducted in October, during spraying time, tested 20 randomly selected blood samples from four villages: Mahi Nangal, Jajjal and Balloh in Bathinda district and Dher in Ropar district. The districts are among the highest users of pesticides in the state.

 Regulation of the use of the older-generation organochlorine pesticides, like DDT, Lindane and Aldrin, began in the 1970s. Some were later banned. Organophosphates have higher toxicity.

 The levels of certain organochlorine pesticides in the blood samples are very high, she said. They vary between 15 and 605 times higher than those found in samples of people in the United States, tested by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (and published) in its 2003 report.

 Narain suggested the chemical content of pesticides in India must be different from those in the US. Also, Indian farmers dont take adequate precautions while spraying the chemicals in their fields.

 The people must be told about the harmful effects of the pesticides they have been using. I hold the industry responsible for the dismal situation, she said. We found pesticides that should have disintegrated in the body and been excreted, as claimed by the industry. But they are there.

 The centre has demanded a chemical trespass law to hold manufacturers responsible for chemicals getting into the human body, regular monitoring of pesticides in people and registering only those pesticides that have low toxic level.

 Sangh solace for Advani

 Advani: Unlikely support

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today made it clear that L.K. Advani was not a persona non grata for the organisation.

 The Sangh, which has ensured that Advani quits as BJP president by the end of the year, insisted he was close to it even today and would remain so.

 Advani is very close to the RSS even today. He expressed certain views on Mohammed Ali Jinnah in Pakistan. We conveyed our reservation on that. The matter ended there itself. Relations with the BJP continues to remain same as before, Sangh spokesman Ram Madhav said.

 Advani will remain a Sangh member. Whether he remains the BJP president or not, he will remain close to the Sangh, he added.

 Eager to set the record straight on the vexed RSS-BJP relations, Madhav maintained that the Sangh would not decide who Advanis successor will be and denied the allegation that the RSS was a control freak. 

 They (the Sanghs offshoots) share our ideology. On certain issues we may have disagreements, but they work independently. They exchange notes with us, he said.

 Madhav also contested reports that the RSS was not helping the BJP in the Bihar elections because victory for the National Democratic Alliance would go to Advanis credit. If they win, the victory of the BJP in Bihar is a victory of the RSS because the whole country wants a change for the better in the state, he said.

 Madhav, however, iterated the RSSs position on Partition and said it did not recognise the two-nation theory, which led to the creation of Pakistan. 

 Partition is the result of the erroneous theory?. If tomorrow both countries agree that this theory is wrong and should be undone, everything is possible. But not by force. But we admit the existence of Pakistan. If somebody thinks that Pakistan should be wiped out of the map, we will say no. Our main disagreement is on the theory under which the country was created, he explained.

 Madhav said the RSS had four main security concerns: Islamic terrorism, Left-wing terrorism, Chinas expansionist character and US intervention in South Asia. The last, he claimed, had impeded Indias ability to act autonomously.

 The RSS, he added, believes that India should have the freedom and right to decide its strategic needs.

 Brush teeth for fit heart

 Washington, Feb. 9 (AFP): Regular brushing isn?t just good for your teeth, it may as well help your heart stay fit, according to a recent study.

 ?This is the most direct evidence yet that gum disease may lead to stroke or cardiovascular diseases,? said Moise Desvarieux, who led the study, published yesterday in Circulation, the journal of the American Heart Association.

 ?And because gum infections are preventable and treatable, taking care of your oral health could very well have a significant impact on your cardiovascular health,? said the assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.

 The study of 657 people linked bacteria-causing periodontal disease and atherosclerosis, in which arteries harden and narrow due to deposition of cholesterol. Researchers tested participants for the bacteria and measured the walls of their carotid arteries. The bacteria that cause gum disease may migrate throughout the body and cause inflammation in the arteries, the doctor said.

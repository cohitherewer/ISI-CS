 Girl child shame for Delhi

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: The unborn girl child is not safe even in the nation?s capital.

 Illegal sex-determination tests and abortion of female foetuses have pushed Delhi closer to having one of India?s lowest child-sex ratios, the city?s happening southern part being the worst offender.

 Birth registration figures made available by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi have revealed that between January and June 2004, only 819 girls were born for every 1,000 boys. In south Delhi, the figure is 762 girls to 1,000 boys. In Rohini, in the city?s north-west, the ratio is 784 to 1,000, and at Najafgarh, in the south-west near the Haryana border, it is 792 girls to 1,000 boys.

 According to members of the Citizen Against Pre-birth Elimination of Daughters (CAPED), an organisation of social activists, doctors and lawyers, mushrooming ultrasound centres have helped Delhiites discover their latest fad for ?no second daughters?. CAPED member Puneet Bedi, a senior gynaecologist with Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, said at least one in seven girls is eliminated in the foetal stage in the capital.

 Bedi, who analysed the statistics using a model that took into account biological principles, said the 80:100 sex ratio of the three lakh births recorded over the first six months of last year indicates at least 30,000 missing girls.

 ?The recent ratio in south Delhi of 75 girls to 100 boys is close to Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab which has the lowest sex ratio. What this indicates is that couples are not preferring to have second daughters. The statistics in Delhi for the last three years is worse than the ones for the last 15 years. There are 3,000 ultrasound clinics in a city which does not even need 300,? Bedi said.

 Alarmed by the declining sex ratio at birth, CAPED members, including representatives from more than 35 state-level non-government organisations, met chief minister Sheila Dikshit last week to demand concrete action from the government. The members said the ban on sex-determination tests had failed to check the menace and pressed for a high-level task force to monitor surveillance on ultrasound clinics. ?The chief minister promised to look into the matter. We have presented her with a three-point agenda to monitor the situation,? said activist Uma Chakravorty.

 The outfit has also demanded strict monitoring of clinical records and the action taken in response to complaints. ?The tests are being done openly. All the doctors protect other doctors. As a result, whatever mechanism is set up, it is a failure,? Bedi said, making the point that the existing law lacks teeth.

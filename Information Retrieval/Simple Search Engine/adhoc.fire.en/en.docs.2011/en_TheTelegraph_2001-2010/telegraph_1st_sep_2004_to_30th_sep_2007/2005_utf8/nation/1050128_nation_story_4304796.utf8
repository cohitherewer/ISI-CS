 Protest at Buta door

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Jan. 27: Schoolchildren here will take their protest to the governor?s doorsteps tomorrow even as more reports of ?missing? students continued to flow in.

 Sumit Kumar, a Class VII student of the capital?s St Paul?s Residential School, seems to be the latest abduction victim in the state. Son of newspaper vendor Vishnu Prasad, Sumit did not return home after he left for school on Tuesday. His parents informed Mehdiganj police station about their missing son and a team under deputy superintendent (town) Rakesh Dubey was formed to look into the case. The family received an anonymous call for ransom last night, rasing fears that the boy could have been abducted.

 Deepak Kumar, a Class IX student of Bhagalpur DAV School, has also been missing since Tuesday.

 The current saga began on January 19 when Kislay Kaushal, a student of Delhi Public School here, was kidnapped while he was on his way to school. Then, Ravi Kant, a student of DAV School, Bhagalpur, went missing on January 24.

 Though the police have claimed that they are on the right track, they seem to have made little progress till now. 

 Students observed a low-key Republic Day yesterday and relay fast and prayers continued today. In a gesture of solidarity, mothers too joined the protest today with many of them skipping lunch. They also offered mass prayers for the welfare of the missing children.

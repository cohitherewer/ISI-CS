 Port Louis, March 31: When Manmohan Singh paid his tribute to Sir Seewosagur Ramgoolam ? regarded as Mauritius? Mahatma Gandhi for liberating the island from colonial bondage ? little did the Prime Minister realise that his remarks would lend themselves to a political spin. But they did.

 In the ethnically surcharged politics of this island with a population of just a million, praise for the ?Father of Mauritius? was construed by elements of the ruling Mauritian Socialist Movement (MSM) as a statement of ?partisanship?.

 As Mauritius goes to polls in September, the odds are reportedly stashed against the MSM and early projections have it that the Labour Party ? led by Navin Ramgoolam, the scion of Sir Seewosagur ? may wrest power.

 An aide of the Prime Minister likened his three-day visit to Mauritius to one a US President may make to India. If the media coverage is a barometer, he may not be far off the mark. 

 Today when Singh and Mauritian Prime Minister Paul R. Berenger addressed the national assembly ? a function to which the media was not called because of space and security constraints ? the marketplace in Port Louis virtually shut shop as most shopowners were glued to their TV sets and barely concealed their irritation when customers dropped by.

 Not because the shopkeepers, who are mostly people tracing their ancestries to India ? Bihar in particular ? feel particularly sentimental or emotional about India. They are askance about the presence of an Indian Prime Minister in the run-up to the elections. Atal Bihari Vajpayee did in 2000 and that was when Mauritius elected its first Prime Minister of French and not Indian origin.

 According to local political watchers, Vajpayee spoke in various places as though he was addressing nukkad (street-corner) meetings in India to allegedly canvass support for the MSM though no one quite explains how.

 The logic runs something like this: ?Vajpayee came and confused the Indian voters? who may have otherwise voted en bloc for the Labour Party. The President, Sir Anerood Jugnauth, whose son Pravin is the deputy Prime Minister, reportedly used the visit to his ?advantage? with the voters of Indian origin.

 So, was Singh applying the ?corrective? as it were when he said ?not only was he (Sir Seewosagur) the Father of the Mauritian Nation but was also a cherished friend of India. The imprint of his personality is still visible in the bonds that unite our peoples??

 His aide maintained no. ?It?s a very difficult visit and he has had to do the balancing act.? 

 He said the MSM may trumpet the slew of agreements signed during the Prime Minister?s visit ? including an Exim bank credit line of $10 million to the Mauritian government for the construction of a sewerage project in Baie-du-Tombeau and an MoU on air services agreement ? as ?feathers in Berenger?s cap?. 

 Singh, who initially hoped to use the trip as a ?much-needed break? from the hurly-burly of Delhi politics, finds himself unwittingly caught in the vortex of the island?s politics.

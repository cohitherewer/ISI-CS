 Fast-track pioneer for faster justice

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, May 16: When he wants to make a point, Justice B.P. Singh goes about it slowly. But his actions are generally fast.

 And he wants justice to be fast, too.

 At a talk he delivered on a topic close to his heart, the Supreme Court judge who pioneered fast-track courts in Maharashtra suggested several ways to speed up verdicts.

 One of the suggestions he made at the talk, Justice Delayed is Justice Denied: The Plight of Indian Poor, organised by the Observer Research Foundation, was curtailing the length of arguments. 

 The judge, who used examples to make his point, said in the US, only half an hour is allotted to one party to argue while a brief of the argument is given to the judge a day earlier.

 At the end of half an hour, he added, the red light blinks and that is the end of the argument whatever happens. But here, even the Supreme Court has the record of hearing arguments for months.

 The judge ? who has re-ignited the debate on shortening the time allotted for arguments since a lawyers strike scuttled former law minister R. Jethmalanis initiative to complete pleadings within three months ? criticised the habit of seeking endless adjournments and the readiness of judges to allow them.

 Singh, most of whose verdicts have been well within reasonable time, said such adjournments delay justice to victims. He underlined the need to reduce the number of appeals and revisions.

 Singh said the conviction rate was as high as 80 per cent in fast-track courts but less than half in other cases because they drag on for too long, forcing compromises. 

 Many laws, he added, also work against the spirit of their enactment. I dont want to name the acts, but many acts are either misused or have become counter-productive...

 The judge said lack of funds and insufficient infrastructure, especially in lower courts, was another reason for delayed verdicts.

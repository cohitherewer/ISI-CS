 Bangla border fencing on hold

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, May 3: The Union home ministry has suspended erection of fences within 150 yards of the international border with Bangladesh that had started in February.

 North Block took the decision in view of home minister Shivraj Patil?s opinion articulated over the last two months that Delhi should not allow fencing in the controversial 212 patches of the 4,097-km of the Indo-Bangla border to act as an irritant in relations between the two countries.

 Patil is also learnt to have been keen that he should not be seen to be coming in the way of improvement in relations and has asked ministry officials to approach this issue ?very cautiously?. The Border Security Force and some other officials had advocated a harder stand but were told that Delhi?s response would have to be measured and mature, according to sources.

 The issue is expected to figure at a review meeting convened by the home minister tomorrow that would be attended by the top brass of the Indian security establishment, including national security adviser M.K. Narayanan. Patil is also keen to refer the issue back to the cabinet committee on security.

 Dhaka has consistently opposed fencing within 150 yards of the Indo-Bangla border, citing the guidelines of 1975 agreed to by the BSF and the Bangladesh Rifles that prohibits either country from erecting ?defensive structures? within 150 yards. 

 Bangladesh says the fence is a defensive structure while Delhi contends that it ? unlike trenches and bunkers ? is designed to stop infiltrators and criminals, not armies.

 India has maintained that fencing the Indo-Bangla border would be an exercise in futility if it leaves gaps in areas where people on the Indian side lived too close to the border.

 More than 62,000 people in 254 villages would be fenced out and at the mercy of the BDR if Delhi were to strictly adhere to the 150-yard guideline, according to a list prepared by the home ministry. If it were to leave the areas unfenced, there would be 212 patches along the border without a fence.

 The cabinet committee on security had last year cleared fencing within 150 yards of the international border but directed that this be taken up after the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in Dhaka. Once the summit was deferred, the home ministry gave the go-ahead to the BSF to start fencing the trouble spots.

 There have since been 10 instances of firing by the BDR to oppose fencing within 150 yards, prompting a rethink in the home ministry.

 The Centre had last year conveyed to Dhaka that Bangladesh had to give up its opposition. Former home secretary Dhirendra Singh had argued that it was Delhi?s sovereign right to decide what it does on its side so long as it did not violate any agreement between the two countries.

 India rejected Bangladesh?s opposition to the fencing at a meeting between BSF director-general R.S. Mooshahary and his BDR counterpart in Dhaka.

 However, Delhi agreed to inform the BDR in advance before it set out to erect the fence within 150 yards to ensure that Dhaka is not taken by surprise by movement of men and material close to the border.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Travel agents back off

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 24: Travel agencies across the country have been forced to withdraw their agitation against the slashing of commission by Air-India after other international airlines supported the national carrier?s move.

 Following Air-India?s decision to reduce commission rates from 7 to 5 per cent, travel agents? associations decided to boycott the sale of its tickets from April 1. But other international carriers started withdrawing their tickets from the agencies, forcing the agents to call off their agitation on April 22.

 Sanjoy Sett, the chairman of Travel Agents? Association of India, described the withdrawal as a ?conditional? one. He said if Air-India does not agree to its terms and conditions the agitation could start again but added that the travel agents were ?hopeful that we will be able to work out a formula in our favour?. 

 ?They want to reduce our commission from 7 to 5 per cent, but that should come into effect from next January,? said Anil Punjabi, the chairman of the rival Travel Agents? Federation of India.

 Other demands include fuel surcharge in the fare component and a 10-year restriction on further reduction of commission. ?They (Air-India) said that they would consider the proposal and get back to us by early next week. We are, therefore, waiting for them to respond before taking any action,? Punjabi added.

 But even among the travel agent bodies differences have surfaced after leaders of the three main associations decided to withdraw the boycott. ?Some office-bearers have also put in their papers. They felt that they were cheated. After fighting so hard for their rights they suddenly felt let down,? a senior official of Travel Agents? Federation of India, who did not wish to be named, said from Delhi.

 Air-India is, however, happy that the boycott has been pushed back for the time being. ?Our suggestion was very fair. We said that you first withdraw the suspension and then we will talk. They have finally understood it,? said Jeetendra Bhargav, the public relations director of Air-India.

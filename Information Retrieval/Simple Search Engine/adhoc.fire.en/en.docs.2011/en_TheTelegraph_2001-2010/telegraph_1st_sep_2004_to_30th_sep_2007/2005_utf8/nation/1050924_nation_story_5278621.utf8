 Karisma closer to a deal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: Actor Karisma Kapoor (in picture above) and her estranged husband Sunjay Kapur are close to a settlement over the guardianship of their five-month-old daughter Samaira, the couples lawyers told Delhi High Court today.

 Sunjay had filed a petition alleging his wife had got a passport made for Samaira in violation of the law and without his consent. He had sought a restraint on Karisma from taking the baby to the US. The court had given the couple till September 15 to work out a reconciliation.

 Today, Sunjays counsel Ashok Desai told the court: We are fairly close but not altogether resolved. We require your assistance.

 Justice Mukul Mudgal called the lawyers to his chamber and, after a 20-minute discussion, set the next hearing for September 27.

 Sunjay was present in court but Karisma wasnt.

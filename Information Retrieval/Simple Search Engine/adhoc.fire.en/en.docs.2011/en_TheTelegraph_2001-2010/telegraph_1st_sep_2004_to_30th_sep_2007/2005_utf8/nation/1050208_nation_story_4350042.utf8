 Crime graph soars, cops in clue hunt 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Feb. 7: The crime situation in Bihar continued to worsen with reports of violence, extortion threats and abduction coming in from different parts of the state.

 Nawada deputy superintendent of police Mithilesh Kumar escaped unhurt while his two bodyguards sustained serious injuries today in an attack by unidentified gunmen, triggering an exchange of fire that left two attackers dead near Harnaut in Nalanda district, police said here.

 The gunmen fired at the vehicle of the DSP while he was returning to Nawada from Harnaut, where he had gone to investigate an abduction case.

 The injured policemen have been rushed to Patna for treatment, police said. 

 In Jehanabad, suspected Naxalites last night gunned down four members of a Dalit family, including two women, police said today. The incident took place at Saidpur village under Kak police station. The slain persons were identified as Teni Manjhi, Ganouri Manjhi and their wives.

 Police are conducting raids at several places to track down the killers. The CPI (ML) has accused Rashtriya Janata Dal nominee Sachidanand Yadav for the murder. Personal enmity is said to be the reason behind the incident, said a source.

 In the state capital, extortionists have threatened two senior doctors with dire consequences if they fail to meet their demands, prompting the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to petition the police for protection.

 Vinod Kumar Khaitan, head of the department of pathology at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, has received three calls in the past week for the payment of the said amount before February 10. 

 The caller identified himself as a legislator and said he wanted the money to fight the elections.

 Manoj Kumar Verma, assistant professor at the same college, received an extortion demand for Rs 2 lakh. The unknown caller has allegedly remained in touch for two weeks.

 Both the doctors have filed complaints with local police stations and written to the state chapter of the IMA, which has requested the senior superintendent of police to take prompt action and ensure their security. Police said they are looking into the case. 

 In November last year, surgeon N.K. Agrawal was killed after he had refused to give in to the demands of extortionists.

 Even as doctors here face fresh extortion threats, report of an alleged abduction has come in from Chhapra. 

 Nirmal Kumar, son of a trader there, was allegedly kidnapped shortly after his engagement. 

 The family members of Kumar are understood to have received calls from unknown persons for Rs 20 lakh, sources said.

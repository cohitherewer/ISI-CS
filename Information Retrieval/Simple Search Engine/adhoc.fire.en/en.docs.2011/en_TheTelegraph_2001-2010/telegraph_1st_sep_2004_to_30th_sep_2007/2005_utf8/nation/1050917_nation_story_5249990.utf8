 New Delhi, Sept. 16: Police have arrested a Pakistani in Delhi on charges of spying. Asim Wasim, also known as Samar Ali, 25, was found with an internal Indian Army report on the 1999 Kargil war, police said.

 Police said Ali is from Sadiqabad in Pakistan. He was arrested from a couriers outlet in Okhla last evening. He was trying to despatch the army document to a contact named Shamsuddin. The packet he was seeking to deliver was addressed to a post box in Al Wagaan in the United Arab Emirates, the deputy commissioner of police (special cell), Ajay Kumar, said.

 Police said the report was prepared by a Reddy Committee but army sources could not immediately identify what the Reddy Committee was. However, Lt General A.R.K. Reddy (now retired), who was a senior officer in 1999, was preparing a study on the Kargil war on instructions from army headquarters. Army sources could not confirm if the document found by the police was the report prepared by the general.

 Police claimed the report was a classified document. Kumar said Ali was also carrying a fake driving licence issued from Hissar in Haryana, a notebook with a list of contacts and a bank card.

 PTI adds: Kumar claimed Ali has confessed that he was working on the directions of Pakistans intelligence agencies and the preliminary probe suggested that he did not acquire the report himself but from some other sources, Kumar said.

 Asked whether the role of any army personnel was being investigated, he said it is too early to say anything in this regard.

 Ali had entered India through Bangladesh and was staying in a rented house in the Nizamuddin area here since May last year.

 He had visited several cities, including Gwalior, Jaipur and Jodhpur, in the past few months and had contacts in at least 15 cities, the police official said. Police suspect Ali may have sent secret documents out of India in the past also and are interrogating him about this.

 He used to withdraw money, which was put into his account abroad, using the ATM of the Muslim Commercial Bank, Kumar said.

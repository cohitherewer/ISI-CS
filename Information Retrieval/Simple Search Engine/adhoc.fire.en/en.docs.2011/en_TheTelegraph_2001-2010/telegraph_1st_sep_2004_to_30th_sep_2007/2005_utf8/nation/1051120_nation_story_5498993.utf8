 Sumitra joins race for MP crown

 Sumitra Mahajan: Dark horse

 Bhopal, Nov. 19: Former Union minister Sumitra Mahajan is emerging as the dark horse in the race for the Madhya Pradesh chief ministers chair.

 The BJP parliamentary board is meeting on Tuesday, when chief minister Babulal Gaur is likely to get the exit signal.

 Uma Bharti, who has her eyes trained on the crown, is facing stiff opposition from central BJP leaders like Sanjay Joshi, Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Rajnath Singh. 

 Umas bid to force her return in October by obtaining the signatures of 106 party MLAs favouring a change of guard in the state earned her the BJP leaders wrath. She ruffled the RSSs feathers, too, when her letter criticising the Sanghs interference in the BJPs affairs became public.

 In the BJPs scheme of things, state party chief Shivraj Singh Chauhan would have been the best bet, but Uma has made it clear that she would not accept Chauhan.

 His key supporters are ministers who used to be her loyalists. A source close to Uma said: Didi is determined to teach a lesson to all those who ditched her.

 BJP insiders said in the event of a deadlock between Uma and Chauhan, the party would look for a compromise candidate like Sumitra who hails from the influential Malwa region that sends a host of MLAs to the Assembly. A seven-time parliamentarian, Sumitra is said to have built bridges with Uma lately.

 Gaur today said that although he had no information about any change of guard, as a loyal worker, he would abide by the partys decision. 

 He said demanding a leadership change was not an act of indiscipline, it is part of politics.

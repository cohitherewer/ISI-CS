 Veil off school gender bias

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, June 6: In a government school in the capital, Dalit students are made to clean the sewers. 

 All over the country, girls sweep and mop classroom floors.

 The education system reinforces gender and caste stereotypes, a core committee of experts working on a new national curriculum framework has found.

 In the lessons that the children are taught, the scientist is always a man, the experts have pointed out. Women are generally passive and bound to their homes.

 To drive the point home perhaps, girls are not allowed to slip out of the school gates to buy a snack from a vendor while the boys are.

 The education system is pushing out girls despite all efforts to include them, says a report authored by the experts. 

 The committee has come up with a new curriculum that is to be approved at the Central Advisory Board of Education meeting tomorrow. It promises ? at least on paper ? to correct the gender bias and make mathematics, physics and chemistry women-friendly. 

 The bias cuts across all states. A study of school texts in West Bengal portrayed women as passive, dutiful and confined to their homes. Women like peasants and manual labourers are shown to be largely powerless, says the report.

 The students imbibe these images. 

 In a study conducted at the Homi Bhaba Centre for Science Education, both girls and boys drew a man when asked to draw a scientist who was young and worked alone in a chemistry laboratory. They used masculine pronouns (he, his) when referring to the scientists in the singular, the report adds.

 One of the suggestions to break the stereotype is to include references to women mathematicians in the mathematics textbooks.

 Women historically have had limited access to science and technology and have almost been excluded from scientific and technological communities, says the report.

 It calls for an end to stereotyping of men as essentially aggressive and macho in the textbooks and points out that boys who do not fit in have a tough time. 

 Men are ridiculed as effeminate if they are not aggressive. Gentle boys are pushed around and sexually exploited by stronger, macho men, says the report.

 The proposals for the new curriculum framework are in contrast with the national curriculum framework for 2000 drawn up under then human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi. 

 It said that unlike women in the West, Indian women need not struggle for their rights as here they got the right to vote without having to fight for it.

 Women in India need not protest for their rights because, as in the case of their right to vote, they would be granted their legitimate dues in the natural course, the report says.

 Girls can now look forward to a more equal system. But not the Dalit children. A teacher who protested against the students being made to clean sewers in school was pulled up by the principal.

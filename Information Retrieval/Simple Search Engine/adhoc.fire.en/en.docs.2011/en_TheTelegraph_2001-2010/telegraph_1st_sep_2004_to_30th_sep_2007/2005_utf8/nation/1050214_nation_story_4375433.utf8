 Stiff test for petrol cars

 Tough ride ahead

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Getting a pollution under control certificate for a petrol car is not going to be a breeze any more.

 The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority is set to introduce, for the first time in the country, Lambda tests in the capital to check the efficiency of catalytic converters fitted in petrol cars.

 The tests for in-use petrol vehicles, most of which are now fitted with catalytic converters that turn harmful hydrocarbons and carbon monoxides into carbon dioxide and water vapour, will be made mandatory in New Delhi from May 15, 2005.

 If the cars don?t pass the Lambda test, which checks the efficiency of the converter, they will be given a rejection certificate and will have to go back to the garage.

 Lambda is a measure that represents actual to stoichiometric air-fuel ratio in the exhaust emissions. It is calculated using direct measurement data of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the engine exhaust gases. 

 The Lambda sensor, located in the exhaust system in front of the catalytic converters, constantly measures the remaining oxygen in the exhaust gases.

 Going by international norms, for a well-tuned vehicle, the Lambda value should be between 0.97 and 1.03.

 The Union ministry for road transport and highways, in its February 10, 2004, notification, had allowed the introduction of the Lambda test but left the option of implementation to the state governments.

 New Delhi?s move is now expected to show the way to other cities. A recent report of the Central Pollution Control Board indicated an increase in the air pollution levels in the capital, with respirable suspended particulate matter and NOx levels higher than last year.

 The decision is giving sleepless nights to leading automobile manufacturers like General Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra, who fear that more states could go New Delhi?s way.

 According to Centre for Science and Environment director Sunita Narain, a recent Lambda test conducted by the Automotive Research Association of India in Pune on 23 cars of different automobile companies saw eight new cars failing the test, raising questions about the efficiency of catalytic converters.

 ?The only defence that the automobile companies have is that the cars they manufacture are the best in the world. They have catalytic converters but say they have never run Lambda tests as this was not asked for. Introducing the tests for getting the pollution under control certificate will make it more difficult for manufacturers to get away,? Narain said.

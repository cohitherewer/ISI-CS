 Leather scientists chase arthritis cure

 G.S. MUDUR 

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Biochemist Rengarajulu Puvanakrishnan has spent years tinkering with chemicals that go into the processing of leather for fancy handbags and designer shoes. Now, he is trying to exploit his leather science expertise to chase medical applications.

 Through experiments on rats, Puvanakrishnan has shown that mild and short pulses of electromagnetic fields may serve as potential therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a devastating condition marked by erosion and loss of bone in the joints.

 The results are positive, but we dont know how it works. But this is worth pursuing, said Puvanakrishnan, head of biotechnology at the Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI), Chennai. 

 Over the past decade, studies from Italy, Taiwan and the US have indicated that short pulses of electromagnetic fields delivered over a period of a few weeks can slow down bone loss.

 Doctors cautioned that the benefits of electromagnetic therapy are yet to be conclusively demonstrated. However, the results have generated interest because of difficulties in treating rheumatoid arthritis. 

 Rheumatoid arthritis is among the worst chronic diseases to treat, said Dr Ambrish Mithal, president of the Indian Society for Bone and Mineral Research. The response to existing therapy is highly unpredictable and the best therapy available today is not the ideal therapy. Anything promising needs to be investigated.

 The biology of connective tissue provided the link between leather science and arthritis. 

 At the CLRI, Puvanakrishnan and his colleagues have spent decades studying cattle, sheep, and goat hide, all of which are made up of connective tissue. Hide comes in different grades of quality and the researchers investigated connective tissue features in high-quality hide that is always in demand for premium leather products.

 Indias leather exports rely on products from high-quality hide and we were trying to understand what in connective tissue is associated with superior hide, Puvanakrishnan said.

 However, similar connective tissue is also found in human bone joints.

 As the number of international studies hinting a role for electromagnetic fields in the treatment of arthritis grew, the CLRI researchers began their own experiments to evaluate the efficacy of this new approach, collaborating with doctors at the Tamil Nadu Veterinary University for tests on rats.

 The scientists injected heat-killed tuberculosis bacteria into the paws of rats. The dead bacteria cannot cause tuberculosis, but they stimulate an immune reaction that mimics arthritis by causing inflammation and swelling in the paws of the animals.

 The researchers then exposed the rats to low-intensity pulsed electromagnetic fields 90 minutes a day for four weeks. 

 Microscopic examinations, blood tests and X-rays of the paws after the treatment revealed reductions in swelling as well as inflammation, the scientists said, reporting their findings in the journal Bioelectromagnetics.

 A study supported by the US National Institutes of Health on the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in postmenopausal women began earlier this year at the University of Virginia. It is expected to be completed by July 2006.

 Puvanakrishnan said uniform guidelines for the use of electromagnetic therapy for arthritis in humans do not exist. One of the goals of the CLRI studies is to determine the right intensity, frequency, and duration of exposure to such fields for a beneficial effect on the bone.

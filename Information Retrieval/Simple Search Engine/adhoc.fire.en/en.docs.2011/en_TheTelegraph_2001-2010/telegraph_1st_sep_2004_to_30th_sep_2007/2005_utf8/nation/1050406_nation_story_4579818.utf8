 Partners bristle at Paswan date

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, April 5: Ram Vilas Paswan has come under fire from United Progressive Alliance partners for hobnobbing with NDA leaders to form a government in Bihar.

 The Lok Janshakti Party chief, whose 29 MLAs can break the deadlock in central-ruled Bihar, drew flak from his allies after he met Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar on Saturday.

 A senior UPA leader said it was ?foolish of him to meet Nitish to form a government with the BJP?s outside support?. Another said: ?We are at a loss to understand how he got the impression that nobody will object to an indirect arrangement with the BJP.?

 While CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan and CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury came down strongly on Paswan, sources said RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav took up the matter with the Congress high command, asking how a UPA cabinet minister could discuss government formation with an NDA leader.

 The Congress, the leading partner in the UPA, today said it would not be easy to accept the Dal (U) as an ally even if it parted ways with the BJP. ?It is not possible to comment on hypothetical things. But it is difficult to see anyone in a new garb after they have openly fought the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls along with the BJP,? spokesperson Anand Sharma said.

 Declaring that the Congress would remain through thick and thin with the RJD, he, however, said his party did not find anything wrong in Paswan?s meeting Nitish to end the political logjam in Bihar. Sources said the party did not want to push Paswan beyond a point and perhaps into the NDA?s lap. 

 The UPA?s displeasure has already been conveyed to Paswan by Bardhan, Yechury as well as Tariq Anwar, on behalf of NCP chief Sharad Pawar who is Laloo Prasad?s close friend, sources said.

 Stung by the strong adverse reaction, the LJP chief quickly backtracked. 

 On Thursday, he had said: ?Support from inside or outside can be looked into later, but first the Dal (U) should decide between Bihar and the BJP ? if not at the national level, at least in Bihar. If it is Bihar, then it has to snap ties with the BJP. The Dal (U) and Left parties could ponder on it and the Congress could give support to the government from outside.?

 On Saturday, after the allies made their displeasure known, he changed his tune. ?It is absolutely wrong to say that the LJP is not averse to taking outside support from the BJP. My statement in Ranchi on the issue was wrongly placed.?

 Even as Paswan finds himself in a jam, Laloo Prasad has sent him feelers to form a UPA government. Sources said the railway minister?s emissaries are also in touch 12 out of the 17 Independent MLAs.

 If Paswan doesn?t oblige ? he fought the elections on an anti-Laloo plank ? plans are afoot to wean away some 20-odd MLAs from his party, sources said.

 ?The deadlock is because of Ram Vilas. As fresh polls look imminent, all MLAs, especially those from the LJP, are restive. It is, therefore, possible that the LJP can split as it is a smaller party,? said RJD spokesperson Shivanand Tiwary.

 Trashing the talk, a source close to Paswan said: ?With the dissolution of the Bihar unit, it would be difficult to poach LJP legislators. A split has to be recognised by the Speaker and since the House is not constituted, the question does not arise.?

 With the Assembly in suspended animation, the MLAs are not getting their salary or allowances, another reason for them to be restive.

 Senior RJD leader and Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said the LJP would soon crumble like ?a house of cards?. ?Some of the LJP leaders will join us and others will go to the opposite side, but they will definitely go away, leaving Paswan in the lurch,? Singh said.

 A-I asked to pay for baggage loss

 New Delhi (PTI): Holding Air-India guilty 

 of deficiency in services, a consumer court has asked it 

 to cough up Rs 25,000 and $400 as compensation to a shooter 

 who lost her baggage and pistol while returning from Germany. 

 The Delhi State Consumer Commission raised the compensation from Rs 5,000 awarded earlier by a district consumer forum to Anu Raj Singh and dismissed appeals of the airline and the Airport Authority of India . 

 The court said it would make such airlines efficient and careful in future about not taking the loss of consumers baggage casually by getting relieved from its liability paying some meagre amount. 

 Singh had gone to Germany as a member of the national team to take part in an event five years ago. She filed a complaint in the consumer court after the airline refused to entertain her claims.

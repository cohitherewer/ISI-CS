 Canada seeks reactor scan

 Washington (Reuters): Canada has urged India to allow nuclear inspectors access to a Canadian-supplied reactor where experts say the country produces a significant amount of its weapons-grade plutonium.

 Lack of independent access to the CIRUS reactor, located north of Mumbai, is one of the issues slowing implementation of a nuclear cooperation deal that the US announced with India on July 18. 

 The deal has come under fire from the US Congress and from non-proliferation experts who say the case of the 40-mw reactor raises questions about Indias trustworthiness.

 Canada said on Monday it has urged US and Indian officials to designate the reactor a civilian facility open to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

 The US is directly affected because it supplied CIRUS with heavy water, which is used in some reactors to moderate nuclear fission.

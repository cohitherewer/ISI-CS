 Indo-Thai games

 New Delhi, April 27: An Indian Air Force team is flying F-16 aircraft in Thailand, for the first time since the US offered the fighter planes to India. A team of the Royal Thai Air Force is also in India flying the IAF?s Su-30 fighter planes out of Bareilly.

 The US government last month cleared Lockheed Martin and Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) to bid with the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the F/A-18 Superhornet for an Indian order of 126 multi-role combat aircraft. 

 The US has also cleared the sale of an unspecified number of F-16s to Pakistan.

 The exchange programme with the Royal Thai Air Force is in preparation for joint exercises that the IAF and the Thai air force are planning. The crews for the exercises are familiarising one another with the language and practices for joint manoeuvres, IAF sources said here today.

 ?The visits are stepping stones for defence cooperation between the two air forces,? an IAF statement said. ?The teams are expected to understand each other?s work ethos and culture?.

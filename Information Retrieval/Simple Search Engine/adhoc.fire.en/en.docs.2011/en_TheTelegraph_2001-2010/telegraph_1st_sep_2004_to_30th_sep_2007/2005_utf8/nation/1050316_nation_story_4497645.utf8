 Corruption boomerang

 Mumbai, March 15: An inquiry commission has passed strictures against anti-corruption crusader and social activist Anna Hazare, alleging maladministration in two public trusts he runs.

 The Justice P.B. Sawant Commission report also indicted three ministers who have already quit. The commission, which ironically was formed after Hazare went on a fast demanding a panel to probe several charges against the government, said Hazare spent Rs 20 lakh from the funds of his trust, Hind Swaraj, to celebrate his birthday. Hazare was not available for comment.

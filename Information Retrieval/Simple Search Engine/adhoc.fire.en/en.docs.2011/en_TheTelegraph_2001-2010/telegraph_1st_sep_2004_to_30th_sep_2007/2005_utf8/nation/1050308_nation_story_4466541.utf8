 Halim in Fiji poll race

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 7: Bengal Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, the longest-serving presiding officer in the country, will be India?s candidate for the post of chairman of the executive committee of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA).

 The election will be held at the 51st CPA conference in Fiji in September.

 Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who could have been a candidate, opted out for the ?most experienced and most deserving? Halim, who can make India?s voice heard in the international fora.

 Chatterjee has begun a vigorous campaign for Halim, who has been the Bengal Speaker for nearly two-and-a-half decades, by writing to his counterparts in various Commonwealth countries.

 He also held talks with external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh and foreign secretary Shyam Sharan to discuss ways to popularise Halim?s candidature.

 Lok Sabha sources said Chatterjee sent letters to the Speaker of the South African parliament and the House of Commons external affairs minister last week through Singh.

 He feels if ?our man? can bag the Commonwealth top post, India can counter the western perception of human rights violations in the country.

 Halim had missed the bus three years ago as the BJP-led government had okayed then Rajya Sabha chairperson Najma Heptullah?s bid to become president of the International Parliamentary Union.

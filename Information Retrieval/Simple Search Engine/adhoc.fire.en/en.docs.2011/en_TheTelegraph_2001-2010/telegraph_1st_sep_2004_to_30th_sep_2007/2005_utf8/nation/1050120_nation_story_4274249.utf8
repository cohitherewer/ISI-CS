 Court warning for errant poll officials

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, Jan. 19: In yet another attempt to ensure fair polls in Bihar, Patna High Court today pronounced that officials held guilty of favouring candidates in elections, must face departmental action and, if necessary, criminal cases. 

 Merely banning them from poll duty or transferring them from one job to another may no longer be sufficient, it observed.

 The division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S.N. Hussain called upon the election commission to work out modalities for taking action against errant public servants extending undue benefit to political parties and candidates. The bench was hearing a public interest petition.

 The counsel for the petitioners, Mahendra Gupta, interpreted the order to mean that the Election Commission would henceforth be bound to identify public servants found guilty of misconduct during elections and possibly share the evidence with state governments to enable the latter to take action.

 The PIL filed by Manoj Kumar of Kisan Majdoor Sangh had even mentioned the names of about 20 senior government officials, including IAS, whom the EC had held guilty of misconduct in polls, but escaped with a mere transfer by the government. 

 ?A clear case is that of Chhapra in the last Lok Sabha elections. Some presiding officers gave a ?clean? report, but the inquiry by the commission found the officers guilty and ordered repolls. The state government took no action against the accused,? Gupta said. 

 The PIL mentions names of at least four former district magistrates of Patna, who were accused of ?going out of the way to help one particular candidate?. 

 Keeping up the campaign for ?free, fair and fearless? elections, Gupta, who is also the counsel for the ongoing Indian Medical Association?s petition in the high court, said the government was clearly responsible for all election-related irregularities in the state.

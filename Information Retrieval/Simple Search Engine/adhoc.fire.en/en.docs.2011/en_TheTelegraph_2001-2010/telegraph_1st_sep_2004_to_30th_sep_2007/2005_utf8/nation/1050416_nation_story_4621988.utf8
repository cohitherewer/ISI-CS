 New Delhi, April 15: Abhishek almost lost his hand and got beaten up by police today in the mad crush for tickets to Sunday?s Kotla one-dayer.

 Like hundreds of cricket-crazy fans, the North Delhi Engineering College student had lined up since the wee hours at the Kashmere Gate branch of the Central Bank of India. He was 20th in the serpentine queue that was swelling by the second and was sure he wouldn?t have to go home disappointed.

 When his turn came, he slid his hand under the glass counter. But before he could get what happened, the glass before him smashed into smithereens.

 The thronging crowd, which had been restive all along, had suddenly turned unruly and police were wielding lathis to keep them in check. In the melee, he lost his college identity card, his passport to getting the Rs 200 student pass for the match.

 ?I was the 20th person in the queue in the morning and by the time, I reached the window, there was talk that tickets were over. My hand was in the window when the glass broke and I just managed to withdraw it in time.

 ?But my identity card was lost. I then went and filed a complaint with the police, showed it to the bank officials and managed to get a ticket,? he said, counting his blessings his hand was still in one piece.

 The scene was as chaotic at Central Bank?s Parliament Street outlet, where the higher-end tickets ? priced at Rs 11,000, Rs 5,000 and Rs 1,000 ? were being sold. Hundreds had lined up since Thursday evening, the more enthusiastic ones keeping vigil all night.

 Things went haywire when there was a sudden surge in the numbers in the morning. Hundreds who had gone to four other branches of Central Bank had been directed to Parliament Street saying tickets were being sold at two outlets only.

 Within an hour-and-a-half of the counters opening, the tickets were sold out. Not unexpected since the Delhi District Cricket Association had kept aside a bulk for VIPs and high-profile spectators.

 Sources said only about 500 higher-end tickets were available for sale to the general public, although the cricket body kept up its story that 7,000 tickets in a stadium seating 22,000-25,000 were up for grabs.

 The Parliament Street ticket-seekers had gone through a rough time on Wednesday as well. Many had come close to being beaten up by the police that day when the tickets were originally scheduled to be sold.

 When the bank officials suddenly announced the sale had been put off, the crowd went berserk. But for the timely intervention of the police and Rapid Action Force personnel, the bank manager would have been lynched.

 Despite the numerous hitches, there were some fortunate ones like Kamal Sardana who managed to get tickets. He had come from Meerut yesterday with his 15-year-old son to try his luck.

 ?I wanted to see an India-Pakistan match. I had tried to make it to Kanpur but could not. This time, I did not want to fail so I arrived well in advance. I wanted good seats and I was willing to pay for it,? he beamed, clutching his Rs 5,000 tickets.

 Others had come from as far as Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh and Rewari in Haryana and happily kept midnight vigil outside the bank.

 But Manoj, who had come from Faridabad, had to go back disappointed. 

 ?When India had lost today?s match, I did lose some enthusiasm. But I wanted to watch the Kotla match because it is going to be an interesting to see if India can draw the series,? he said.

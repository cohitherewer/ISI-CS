 Srinagar, Nov. 17: They had travelled to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir two days before the temblor struck, to be reunited with family members living on the other side.

 Six weeks on, they have returned, still unsure about a reunion with the families they had left behind this side of the Line of Control.

 What I saw there was mind-boggling. Everything has been destroyed. I dont believe my family members back home are all safe. We lived in tents from October 8 till today, said Haji Mohammad Sidiq of Salamabad in Uri, one of the 24 passengers who came back to what seemed a changed world yesterday.

 The Aman Setu (friendship bridge) they had crossed on October 6 was a pile of rubble on the KDK stream. As the 2 km stretch of road from Chakoti to the Kaman Post on the Pakistan side is still unmotorable, the passengers had to walk that last bit before crossing the makeshift footbridge that the Pakistani authorities have laid on the stream.

 The Srinagar-Muzaffarabad peace bus, which had carried them to the Kaman Post on their onward journey, was not waiting for them this side of the ceasefire line. The travellers were herded into a smaller bus, run by the Jammu and Kashmir Road Transport Corporation, to be driven back to their homes.

 They were accompanied till Kaman Post by Shafeeq Ahmad Kiani, the official in charge of quake relief in Chakoti. He said 19 people from the Indian side were still in Muzaffarabad. 

 We are trying to locate them so that they can be sent back home.

 Kiani was also expecting 16 PoK residents to return today, but they preferred to stay back on this side for some more time.

 I could not believe my eyes; it looked as though the Day of Judgement had caught up with us, recalled Mohammad Qadir, 65, a resident of Uri town in north Kashmir. The earth didnt simply shake; it cracked and roared like I had never seen before.

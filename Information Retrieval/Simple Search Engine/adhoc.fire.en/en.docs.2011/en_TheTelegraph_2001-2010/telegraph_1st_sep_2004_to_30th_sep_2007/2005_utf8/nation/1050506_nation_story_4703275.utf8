 Cops on extortion alert

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, May 5: Crime and doctors are back in the news.

 The imposition of Presidents rule has led to a significant change in the law and order situation in the state. After a spate of extortion threats and the killing of a surgeon in Patna last year, doctors breathed easy after the Buta Singh-led administration cracked the whip on criminals.

 But, with city doctors Vijay Khetan and Sunil Kumar making allegations of extortion threats, the medical community is once again concerned over the safety of its members.

 Khetan heads the pathology department of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital while Kumar is a child specialist and proprietor of Kids Care Clinic.

 Kumar, who has allegedly been asked to cough up Rs 10 lakh, lodged a case with Patrakar Nagar police station on Tuesday. 

 Officials of the state unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) held a meeting in this regard and later informed the senior superintendent of police about the extortion threat.

 The matter was brought to the notice of the governor, who directed the city police to look into the matter without any delay.

 ?Crimes against members of the medical community had gone down after Presidents rule was imposed and it was some relief for us. But, it seems that doctors are being targeted yet again. Something has to be done urgently,? state IMA working president Shajahanand Singh said.

 An IMA delegation today met the governor and the director-general of police and submitted memorandums. 

 State police chief Ashish Ranjan Sinha said he has taken personal interest in Kumars case and directed SSP N.H. Khan to pursue the case. ?Any such extortion threats or calls to any doctor in the state will be reported to me at once and I will follow up the case myself,? Sinha assured the doctors.

 Khan claimed that the police have traced the person who called up Kumar for extortion. ?It appears to be a case with a difference?. not like the usual cases of threats by professional gangs. Apparently, it has something to do with the purchase of a new house. We are exploring the details,? Khan said.

 Speaking on the allegations of the other doctor, Khetan, SSP Khan said the complaint was an old one. ?Besides, the complainant has come up with contradictory statements,? he added.

 Arjun calls states meet on quotas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh has called a meeting of state education ministers on August 27 to discuss the recent Supreme Court order scrapping quotas for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students in unaided private educational institutions.

 Left parties, which say the order would affect disadvantaged students, have also become active on the issue. CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan and CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow and urge him to bring a law to overturn the order. We will ask the Prime Minister to bring a law. Private colleges, whether aided or unaided, have a certain social commitment to fulfil, Bardhan said.

 For the ruling Congress, too, the issue is important as it affects a huge vote bank ? the deprived sections ? and more so as it has already lost much of its support among Dalits to outfits like Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party.

 The court order has come at a time when the human resource development ministry under pressure from southern states has drawn up a bill ? the Private Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admissions and Fixation of Fees) Bill ? to bring the burgeoning private institutions under control. The court has started issuing orders because of our failure to bring some order in the lawless situation which exists in this private educational sector, said an official.

 Officials say MPs and MLAs cutting across party lines have had a role in making the system what it is today. The business of opening private colleges is lucrative and it is also a way of nurturing their constituencies, they point out.

 Senior ministry officials say they are thinking of ways to overturn the order which, according to them, has given the reckless private institutions one more way to evade social responsibility. We then have to decide whether they are there just to make money, said an official.

 Jaya takeover threat

 The Supreme Court freed them of government imposed quotas last week. Today came the threat of total control.

 The post-Independence Day growl came from Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa, who warned that her government will not hesitate to take over the administration of private medical and engineering colleges for the sake of social justice.

 The ADMK chief said it was high time Parliament enact a law to put an end to the anomalous situation created by the apex courts verdict that said neither the Centre nor states could impose seat quotas on unaided private educational institutions.

 This means private colleges that do not take government aid can even scrap the seat quotas for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students.

 Jayalalithaa said the ruling of the seven-judge Constitution bench amounted to a major upheaval in the admission policy followed by most states and was against the principles of social justice.

 Cabinet nod to education fund

 New Delhi: The Union cabinet 

 cleared the decks for a non-lapsable education fund on Thursday, 

 reports our special correspondent.

 The Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh will be created out of the money collected from a 2 per cent education cess introduced by finance minister P. Chidambaram in the last budget.

 The decision would help the Centre keep its commitment to spend 6 per cent of the GDP on education and speed up the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, a key project for universalising elementary education. 

 The government has collected an estimated Rs 5,010 crore from the education cess.

 The fund will be non-lapsable and receipts from the education cess will be available on a rollover basis for purposes of financing elementary education and the midday meal scheme, the cabinet said. The fund will supplement the budgetary provisions for the Abhiyan. 

 The cabinet decision also indicates a victory for the human resource development ministry over the finance ministry. Both wanted to be in charge of the fund. 

 The cabinet had to set up a group of ministers, including HRD minister Arjun Singh, Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia, to sort out the hitches. In June, the group decided that the fund would be an extra-budgetary one and will remain with the HRD ministry as a dedicated source of finance for elementary education. 

 The row came to an end after UPA 

 chairperson Sonia Gandhi wrote to the Prime Minister last 

 month, backing the HRD ministrys argument that the 

 fund should be kept under it as a separate, non-lapsable 

 one.

 Radio blow

 The cabinet has refused to approve the second phase of community radio expansion. The most contentious issues were the range of such radios and their right to earn advertising revenue. The cabinet referred the matter to a group of ministers. 

 Bail to VIP kin 

 New Delhi: Delhi High Court 

 has granted bail to former Rajya Sabha member D.P. Yadav?s 

 nephew Vishal Yadav, who is facing trial in the Nitish Katara 

 murder case.

 He was, however, specifically directed not to contact his cousin sister Bharti, a key witness in the case. Yadavs son Vikas, the other accused, is in custody. 

 Child returned

 Meerut (PTI): A sex worker 

 here has saved a three-year-old from being sold and returned 

 the child to her parents. Bheem Mandal kidnapped Kavita, 

 his employer?s daughter, and offered to sell her to Rakhi 

 for Rs 5,000. But Rakhi forced him to hand her back. 

 Pak woman held 

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): A 

 Pakistani woman has been arrested for allegedly staying 

 without a visa at a village in Uttar Pradesh since November 

 2001. Saddikam, 65, had come to India to visit her relatives 

 on a one-month permit.

 For the first time since the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus rolled out on April 7, non-Muslims boarded it on Thursday. Four Sikhs and three Hindus were among the passengers going to PoK.

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today went back to Calcutta armed with the approval of his partys politburo and central committee to go ahead with economic reforms. 

 Yesterday, the politburo had given its go-ahead. The central committee today followed suit. We want Bengal to outshine other states. Employment should be the main focus of the government, said a central committee member. 

 The chief minister, however, has one task left. He has to bring the Left Front partners ? particularly the RSP and Forward Bloc ? to agree with his point of view. 

 The two parties have been critical of the chief ministers deal with the Salim Group and have said the project would end up using agriculture land.

 CPM leaders, however, have clarified that only 500 acres of agriculture land would be used out of a total of 5,000 acres for the project. 

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan has backed Bhattacharjees drive and said he is doing the right thing.

 Bhattacharjees trip to the capital was successful in more than one way. 

 The chief minister was feted by the Prime Minister for his business deals in Singapore and Indonesia. Manmohan Singh assured Bhattacharjee of all possible co-operation in his drive to get investment for Bengal. 

 Bhattacharjee also met officials in the Chinese embassy and asked them to send a business delegation to his state. The Bengal government has identified some sectors where it hopes to attract Chinese investors.

 There was good news for Bhattacharjee from his comrades, too. The politburo and central committee members extended their support to his economic drive.

 The chief minister had maintained from the beginning that CPM general secretary Prakash Karat was with him in his efforts to draw investment to Bengal. 

 The CPM politburo and the central committee also discussed the coming Bihar elections. The party iterated its stand to support Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal even though the CPI is not in an alliance with the RJD. 

 We are of the opinion that secular votes should not be split. Laloo Prasad Yadav is the main force of secularism in Bihar, said politburo member Sitaram Yechury. The Left does not have much at stake in Bihar. The CPM has one seat and the CPI three.

 The issue of joining the UPA-Left coordination committee remained unresolved. The CPM said it will join the committee only after the Centre formally communicates that it will not divest its stake in any of the navratna PSUs.

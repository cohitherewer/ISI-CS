 New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Centre is not in a mood to throw open the entire stretch along the Line of Control for quake relief but it is expected to allow movement through a maximum of two routes.

 Definitely, there is no question of opening up the full LoC in Kashmir. If the move takes shape, perhaps we can open one or two routes from the Poonch and Rajouri side to allow relief to reach the worst-hit areas, said Madan Gopal, the director-general of military operations (DGMO).

 Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf had yesterday called on India to throw open the LoC to accelerate the relief effort. Delhi had immediately responded positively.

 Gopal added that before opening the border, the modalities need to be worked out and ground rules framed. We need to look very minutely into the security concerns, like who will take the relief material and who all will be allowed to go or come, he said. 

 Sources said the home ministry is worried whether Pakistan would ask for similar movement of people from its side to Indian Kashmir. Extremists could use the cover to sneak into India, they added.

 In Pakistan, Musharraf said the permission was not free for all.

 He told reporters in North West Frontier Province that he would allow the movement of reconstruction and relief material but the methodology has to be formalised.

 We will allow the relief goods. Yes, I will allow Kashmiris. But we have to formalise the methodology. I mean it cannot be free for all. We have to formalise the methodology but we would like to encourage it, he said.

 Asked whether the proposal was open to other Indians, he said it was meant for Kashmiri civilians. It is Kashmiri civilians. We are asking for Kashmiris.

 Delhi today offered to restore the telecom infrastructure across the border while Islamabad came up with a proposal to establish mobile telephone links between the two Kashmirs. But each side politely turned down the others offer. 

 India has conveyed its readiness to assist in restoration of disrupted telecom infrastructure in areas affected by the earthquake, the foreign ministry spokesperson said.

 The Pakistani foreign office expressed its gratitude and said it would get back to Delhi if any specific assistance was required. 

 Pakistan then made the proposal to establish mobile telephone linkages across the LoC. We have conveyed that communication linkages already exist through international satellite and sea cable networks, the Indian spokesperson said.

 Nepal braces for Maoist protest

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Feb. 11: The Royal Nepal Army is gearing up to foil the three-day nationwide blockade called by Maoists from Sunday to commemorate the 10th anniversary of their armed rebellion.

 Top RNA officials met here today ? a day after Maoists attacked a prison in western Nepal and freed more than 100 of their colleagues ? to discuss ways of foiling the blockade, which could be used by the rebels to showcase their strength.

 The Maoists have announced that they would block all highways, especially the one leading to the Kathmandu valley where the country?s seat of power is located.

 Sources said the meeting decided to provide security to all vehicles plying on the highway. ?The focus is to ensure that the supply lines to major centres, especially the Kathmandu valley, are not affected,? said a source.

 The army would provide aerial security to trucks plying on highways and transport operators have been asked to get security clearances as this would make them eligible for security cover.

 All vehicles would be organised into convoys for safe passage. The RNA would also post adequate troops on the highways.

 The government has warned of severe action against hoarders and black marketers. It has also ordered the Nepal Oil Corporation to ensure adequate supplies to the valley.

 Security forces today launched a search operation in and around Dhangadhi on the Indo-Nepal border to locate more than 140 prisoners who were freed by Maoists on Wednesday night.

 Defence ties

 Military aid to Nepal?s army is contingent on the situation in the country and the Indian government will ?assess? requests for hardware on the basis of its own security compulsions, highly-placed sources in the defence ministry said in New Delhi today.

 Delhi?s official position is that it has not ordered military supplies to be stopped. ?Military-to-military ties will continue as they are?, but ?should not be confused with military assistance? said a source.

 Wiser, Rahul off campaign trail

 Rahul: Playing safe?

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: Rahul Gandhi, whose controversial comments on governance in Bihar have gifted talking points to ally Laloo Prasad Yadavs rivals, is staying away from the election campaign.

 There is no plan as yet to send Rahul Gandhi to campaign for the party, a senior Congress leader said today. Several candidates have put in requests for the partys GeNext leader despite the goof-up last month.

 When the party was finalising its election strategy with the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Rahul had embarrassed both the Congress and the railway minister by saying there was no governance in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

 The Amethi MP has not ventured outside Uttar Pradesh on campaign duty so far. Even in the state, he has only made token appearances outside his constituency. 

 Leaving the campaigning in Bihar to mother Sonia Gandhi, Rahul quietly left for a week-long visit to southern states on Monday. 

 According to sources, he has clubbed trips to religious places with the business of acquainting himself with the functioning of some successful self-help groups.

 Yesterday, Rahul visited the temple town of Dharmasthala in Karnataka for a darshan of Lord Manjunath, a place his grandmother Indira Gandhi used to frequent. She had also made it her camp during the campaign for the Chikmagalur Lok Sabha byelection in 1978. Rahul was briefed on self-help groups run by the temple administration. 

 Before crossing over to Kerala today, the Congress MP visited two holy places of Jains near Mangalore. 

 Sources said the brief Tamil Nadu leg of the trip will include visit to the temple town of Tiruchirapalli. The visit concludes in Hyderabad later this week.

 Envoy son caught with cocaine 

 New Delhi, Sept. 25 (PTI): The son of a Nigerian diplomat has been arrested for allegedly selling cocaine near a cinema hall in south Delhi.

 On a tip-off, Oladeyo Degi Togun, 31, was arrested outside PVR Cinema in Vasant Vihar yesterday and 10 gm of cocaine was seized from him, the deputy commissioner of police (narcotics and crime prevention), A.S. Cheema said.

 He said the accused and his accomplices tried to run away on seeing the raiding party but Togun was chased and overpowered. The others escaped.

 Cheema said Togun was under the impression that being a diplomats son he could not be prosecuted. The official claimed that Togun confessed that he had been selling cocaine to high-class clients in Vasant Vihar and other posh localities. 

 The accused said he was procuring high-grade cocaine through a network of Nigerian colleagues, Cheema said.

 The police official said Toguns mother came to the police station on being informed about her sons arrest but refused to invoke diplomatic immunity. Togun was remanded him in judicial custody.

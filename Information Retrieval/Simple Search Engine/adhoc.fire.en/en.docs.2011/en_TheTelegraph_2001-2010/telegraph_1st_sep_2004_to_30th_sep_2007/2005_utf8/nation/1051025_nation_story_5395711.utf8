 Onion stocks hope

 Mumbai/Delhi, Oct. 24 (PTI): Retail prices of onions are expected to ease across the country in the second week of November as dealers foresee fresh stocks flooding the markets.

 The government has decided to import onions from China and Pakistan. Besides, the kharif crop of onions from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan is likely to reach markets by November 15, which will help bring down the prices from the current Rs 20-25 a kg, wholesale dealers said.

 According to some traders, there has already been an improvement in onion arrivals in the Navi Mumbai wholesale market.

 Onion prices soared when stocks stopped arriving from major producing regions like Lasalgoan, Satana and Yavla in Maharashtra, where rains damaged the crop.

 In Punjab, wholesale dealers reported a Rs 2.50 drop in the price of the vegetable today, which they attributed to the governments decision to import it.

 We have contracted the import of 2,000 tonnes of onions from China and 650 tonnes from Pakistan, and the overall price of the commodity will stabilise soon, said Alok Ranjan, the managing director of the National Agriculture Federation.

 With the festive season round the corner and the threat of hoarding looming large, the government decided to allow the import of onions to protect consumers.

 The consignment from Pakistan will reach Delhi markets in a week, while the Chinese consignment would hit the Mumbai port within two weeks, Ranjan said.

 The Delhi government today said the prices of onions at its retail outlets have been reduced by Re 1 because of increased supply. They will be sold at Rs 15 and Rs 19 a kg, depending on their category.

 On the overall national prices, Ranjan said: There is no supply shortage in the country except in some areas of Maharashtra, where crops have got damaged.

 The arrival of the kharif crop will, however, make up for the initial damage, he said.

 Officials of the agriculture ministry, however, blamed the handiwork of speculators for the crisis. At a meeting of the Crop Weather Watch Group, they said the current situation was the result of manipulation in retail prices, using reports of damage to the crop in Maharashtra.

 Their review revealed a significant rise in onion prices since October 17.

 Museum theft shield cry

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, May 3: The parliamentary standing committee on culture has expressed concern over the lack of adequate security in all museums, particularly the National Museum in the heart of the capital.

 ?It is a matter of urgent need to have fool-proof security to guard the invaluable antiquities preserved at museums,? says its latest report. 

 The caution comes in the wake of thefts of invaluable possessions from museums across the country.

 Rabindranath Tagore?s Nobel medal that went missing from Visva-Bharati University last year is yet to be recovered.

 There has been a similar theft in Delhi?s high-profile National Museum. Last year, the pistol that Pakistan?s Lt General A.A.K. Niazi handed over to the late Lt General J.S. Aurora on the defeat of Pakistani forces in the 1971 Bangladesh war was stolen from its naval maritime heritage gallery.

 The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, according to experts, remains in the statute book for preventing theft of antiques without serving any purpose.

 The committee has recommended modern security gadgets to guard museums, besides training of security personnel for handling these gadgets. ?Modernisation and security are inter-related,? it says.

 The panel has directed the culture ministry to provide museums with adequate funds to beef up their security and appoint a consultant who will be able to offer ?global expertise?.

 Concerned over the thefts, the culture ministry has set up a departmental committee to review and suggest improvements in security arrangements. 

 The committee has so far held four meetings in Delhi, Calcutta, Allahabad and Mumbai and its officials are making on-the-spot security assessment of at select museums.

 Following the theft of Niazi?s pistol, the National Museum is planning to launch a full-fledged modernisation programme, including ?installation of modern gadgets?, says the parliamentary committee.

 A widespread outcry over the authorities? indifferent attitude towards precious antiquities following the theft of Tagore?s medal led the ministry to launch two missions ? the national mission on antiquities and that on building heritage to create national consciousness about antiquities and strengthen the existing laws for their protection.

 The ministry has recently merged the two missions, with the Archaeological Survey of India as its nodal agency. 

 ?The combined mission will help the authorities concerned to formulate a national, state and a local policy to safeguard and manage Indian heritage,? says the report.

 The committee has also expressed concern over the increasing encroachments on the land of centrally protected monuments. ?There should be prompt action against the encroachers with the help of state governments and local administrations.? 

 It has also recommended adequate budgetary outlay for security arrangements of these monuments.

 Jalan tips for Pranab

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 27: Rajya Sabha member Bimal Jalan today gave Pranab Mukherjee some tips on running his defence ministry. 

 While the Congress MPs cried for a probe into the defence deals struck by the NDA government, the former Reserve Bank governor told Mukherjee to rise to the occasion. 

 Jalan, a nominated member in the Upper House, wanted Mukherjee to formulate a system where the minister would not have a role in defence purchases. 

 If the defence minister is not part of the decision-making process in arms deals, one would not fault him directly if allegations are levelled later. Then politicians, too, would not have much of an interest in nit-picking over defence deals, argued Jalan.

 ?Why should the defence minister sign that file?? the Rajya Sabha member asked. He said ministers should restrict themselves to taking decisions on policy, strategy, budget and other danger zones.

 A defence minister is empowered to clear purchases worth Rs 50 crore. Bigger purchases have to go to the cabinet committee on security.

 Jalan suggested that the government constitute three panels with officials from the three services, the defence ministry and other departments like finance and vigilance. They should be entrusted with the job of shortlisting, selecting and finalising deals with advice from technical experts.

 He said, unlike other purchases by the government, defence deals operated in an imperfect market where the ideal requirements and what was being supplied may not always match and later allegations of wrongdoing could surface regarding this.

 Congress member Anand Sharma, who moved the discussion on the working of the defence ministry, had earlier demanded a probe into previous defence deals.

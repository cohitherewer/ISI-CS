 Special status hope for hill council

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ghisingh: Poll ready

 New Delhi, April 14: The 

 Union home ministry today agreed to consider granting special 

 status to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), raising 

 hopes that the long-pending election to the hill governing 

 body could be possible within the six-month deadline set 

 earlier.

 Interim administrator of the council Subash Ghisingh has so far refused to hold the DGHC poll until an alternative to the council is formed. The election was supposed to be held by March 25. 

 Union home secretary V.K. Duggal today said Ghisingh had, ?in principle?, agreed to hold the DGHC elections within six months. During this period, the hill leader would like the government to make up its mind on the kind of status it is willing to grant the council.

 The central and state government will explore the options of according constitutional status to the council under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution or through special provisions under Article 371, Duggal said after a tripartite meeting at North Block attended by Ghisingh, West Bengal chief secretary Asok Gupta and home secretary A.K. Deb.

 If the DGHC is granted Sixth Schedule status, it will become as autonomous as the Bodo Territorial Council negotiated by the Bodo Liberation Tigers in Assam. 

 Autonomous councils under the Sixth Schedule not only get funds directly, to be spent according to local priorities, but are also empowered to block the application of laws enacted by the legislature, unless specifically notified. In some instances, the councils and its officers also have the right to try criminals for offences punishable with less than five years? imprisonment.

 A special status under Article 371, however, needs to be negotiated harder, especially if a free hand to undertake development projects is not all that Ghisingh is eyeing. 

 Under this provision, the council can set up separate development boards that will submit their reports to the Assembly. The provision has been used in Maharashtra to create developmental boards for areas like Marathwada and Vidharba. 

 Ghisingh, though, was cautious and rejected suggestions that he wanted control over the police in the Darjeeling hills that comprised the subdivisions of Kalimpong, Kurseong and Darjeeling.

 Left mum on Bhel in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 25: The Left may have cried hoarse against Bhel disinvestment, but in Parliament it will not raise a murmur of protest.

 The Left leaders, who are opposed to the governments decision to divest 10 per cent of Bhel shares, are in a bind ? the conflict has lingered but carrying it to Parliament would give the BJP leverage.

 The monsoon session of Parliament began on a note of camaraderie with Congress ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Ghulam Nabi Azad working out a floor strategy with senior Left MPs to keep the BJP at bay. 

 The Left will oppose us aggressively but will also support us to the hilt, said Union parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 On Bhel, the CPMs Rajya Sabha leader Nilotpal Basu said: We have articulated our concern on the issue to the highest leadership of the UPA. We expect an amicable settlement.

 The BJPs strategy to mount an offensive on the UPA government has restrained the Left. The main Opposition party has tabled an adjournment motion for a discussion on the governments failure to check infiltration from Bangladesh. It also plans to bring an adjournment motion against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for praising British colonial rule in his speech at Oxford University.

 Basu said the Left parties would support the government on the floor of the House and there was no question of their siding with the Opposition party to corner either the government or the Prime minister.

 Bhel, however, seems to have put the Left on the backfoot. The CPM did not expect the row to spill over to the monsoon session and had hoped the government would backtrack on the divestment before that. But the UPA stuck to its stand and so did the Left. Several meetings between the Prime Minister, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Left leaders took place, but none yielded results.

 Basu could not say how long it would take to resolve the crisis but indicated that it might be a long haul. We do not believe in deadlines, the MP said.

 Senior Congress ministers said the Left parties are with the government and there is no threat as long as they stick to their political line to keep the UPA government in office so that the BJP does not gain ground.

 For the Left, therefore, there will be two strategies when it comes to the UPA. Outside Parliament, it will make its opinions known loud and clear, but once inside, the differences will dissipate.

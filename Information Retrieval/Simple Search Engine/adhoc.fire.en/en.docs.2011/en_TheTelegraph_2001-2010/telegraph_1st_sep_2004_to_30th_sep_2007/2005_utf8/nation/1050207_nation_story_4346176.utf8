 Patil goes soft on Naxalites

 - Red terror spreads to Karnataka 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Shivraj Patil: Mellow voice

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Union home minister Shivraj Patil apparently toned down his stand on Left extremists and advised security forces to go easy on ?encounter? killings even as Karnataka joined the league with Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar as yet another target of Naxalite violence.

 ?There should not be any proxy encounters and an attempt should be made to convince the Naxals to come into the national mainstream,? the home minister was quoted by PTI as saying.

 Patil, in yet another indication of a softened stance towards the rebels, spoke of going into the ?causes? of Naxalite-instigated violence if a long-term solution is to be found. ?One has to seek the causes for Naxalite violence before looking for remedies,? he said, identifying economic disparities, social injustice and infrastructural imbalances as the catalysts.

 Patil?s statements came on a day when the Karnataka police and the Special Task Force were engaged in an ?encounter? with Naxalites in the Menasinahadde forest near Chikmagalur.

 Two activists were killed and 12 escaped the police dragnet and ran away into the forest. Two police personnel were also injured.

 The STF, which was constituted to nab sandalwood smuggler Veerappan and was supposed to be wound up after he was killed, was redeployed to flush out the Naxalites.

 In Jharkhand, fierce encounters took place between the police and the extreme Left on the day of polling of the first phase. The violence accounted for a low turnout.

 However, political sources said Patil?s ?palliatives? were aimed at the Andhra groups of the CPI(ML), especially since the talks between them and the state government ran aground after the first round. Both sides accused each other of attacks, the Naxalites alleging that police had opened fire on armed activists in the name of ?encounters? and the government maintaining that the extremists had started ?liquidating? members on their ?hit lists?.

 In a letter released to Telugu newspapers, the Naxalites had warned the police to end their ?combing? operations in forests and villages.

 The human rights activist and convener of the Committee of Concerned Citizens, K.G. Kannibaran, wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking his intervention to break the deadlock. Official sources maintained that Singh was interested in seeing that the dialogue is resumed.

 Patil told PTI that the Centre had encouraged the Andhra government and the Naxalites to come to the negotiating table. He added that he was told by the Andhra government that it had not opted out of the talks but had only asked the Naxalites to stop moving around with arms. Patil, however, expressed hope that the situation would be resolved.

 as ?people have realised that there can be no development without peace?.

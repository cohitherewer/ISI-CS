 Laloo Prasad: On middle path

 New Delhi, May 11: A day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said constitutional bodies must be respected, Laloo Prasad Yadav has lowered his tirade against the Election Commission.

 The railway minister and RJD chief met Singh with a team of party MPs today and clarified that he had not attacked the constitutional body (poll panel).

 Laloo Prasad drew a distinction between attacking the commission and calling for commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswamy to resign. 

 I still stand by my stand that the two election commissioners should step down, he said. I did not attack the Election Commission.

 The minister didnt reveal details of his meeting with Singh. Sources said he told the Prime Minister he agreed with the latters statement.

 The railway minister explained he had read about the charge of caste bias against the two commissioners in a newspaper and, as the MP from the affected constituency (Chhapra), reacted to it.

 Sources said the Prime Minister tried to assuage the feelings of the RJD chief. He agreed with Laloo Prasad that he had a point, but added: We have to be cautious in our utterances about constitutional authorities.

 Bureaucrat L.V. Saptharishi, who triggered the controversy by accusing the two poll commissioners of caste bias, today replied to the showcause notice served on him by the Centre, arguing he had made his revelations in the national interest.

 Saptharishi, now director-general of the Council for Advancement of Peoples Action and Rural Technology (Capart), said IAS officers, too, have been given powers to protect the Constitution.

 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, under whose ministry Capart falls, said the bureaucrat has argued he had written to law minister H.R. Bhardwaj and held a news conference keeping the Constitution in view.

 Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy, who retires this month, also called on the Prime Minister this evening.

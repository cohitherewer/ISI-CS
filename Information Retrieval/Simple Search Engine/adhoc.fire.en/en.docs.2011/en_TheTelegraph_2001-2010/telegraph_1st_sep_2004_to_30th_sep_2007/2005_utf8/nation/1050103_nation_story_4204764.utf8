 India keeps eye on US textile petition

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Jan. 2: For the first time since Independence, India is at odds with developing countries, thanks to globalisation, economic reforms and the country?s rise towards becoming an economic power.

 Textile producers from 51 developing countries have joined their American counterparts in a petition filed by the US textiles industry to limit the imports of textiles and apparel into America after a global textile quota regime ended on Friday.

 The petition, filed before the Bush administration, seeks to limit the import of textiles and apparel from China in nine categories including socks, cotton and synthetic trousers, wool trousers, cotton and synthetic knit shirts, and underwear.

 Such restrictions are allowed under a protocol that China signed in order to be admitted to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001. 

 Although the restrictions are sought to be imposed on China, the petition is of tremendous interest to India: 26 per cent of India?s exports to the US is made up of textiles and the figure is expected to rise this year following an end to textile quotas.

 China will be India?s major competition for the US and other markets.

 Garment importers in the US are hoping to concentrate on a few countries like China and India for sourcing their imports with a new, open trade regime.

 They no longer want to run around among 20 or 30 countries as they used to do when these countries had quotas for sending textiles to the US, but this has put them at odds with America?s beleaguered domestic textile producers.

 The domestic producers originally started filing petitions in October with the US inter-agency Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), made up of officials of the departments of state, commerce, labour, treasury and the US trade representative.

 During the weekend, a federal court in New York ordered injunctions on the Bush administration from imposing any new limits on textile imports from China.

 In October, the administration decided to extend for up to one year even after December 31, 2004, quotas on socks imports from China.

 In doing so, the Bush administration took a leaf out of America?s experience in the 1980s, when similar restrictions against machine tools and automobiles imported from Japan led to voluntary export restraints by the Japanese. 

 China?s response to the strident opposition within the US to increased inflow of its textiles is closely being studied in India. From yesterday, Beijing has taken steps to impose its own export tax on 148 items of clothing as a sop to the Americans.

 This is seen as a smart move because it keeps the levers of export in China?s own hands and the duty accrues to its own government.

 China has also cleverly proposed this duty per piece rather than ad valorem. It gives China the flexibility, as a non-market economy, to manipulate prices and neutralise the duty in practice.

 Meanwhile, a group of 10 developing countries, including Mauritius, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, have asked the WTO to assess the impact of the end of the quota regime and sought advice on how to manage the transition to an open trade regime.

 India has taken the view that such vulnerable textile producers should seek improved preferential treatment from the textile-importing countries and assistance from multilateral financial institutions rather than seek help from the WTO.

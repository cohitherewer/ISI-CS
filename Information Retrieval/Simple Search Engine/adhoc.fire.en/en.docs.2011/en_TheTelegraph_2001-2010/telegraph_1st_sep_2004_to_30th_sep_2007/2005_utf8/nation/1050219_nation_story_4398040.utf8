 Post-Godhra riot accused let off

 Vadodara (PTI): A court has acquitted 

 four persons for lack of evidence in a case of murder during 

 the post-Godhra riots in 2002.

 Sessions judge V.S. Dave acquitted Mukhtiar Sheikh, Hussein Sheikh, Hassan Sheikh and Raiz Pathan of the charge of murdering Ganesh Hargade in Makarpura locality. Hargade was killed by a mob on the night of March 1, 2002, in the wake of the Godhra train carnage of February 27, 2002.

 A case was registered against nine accused, of which five were acquitted by a fast-track court in 2003.

 The four others were arrested and a chargesheet filed against them. Only one witness, Manoj Kumar, out of a total of 16, stood by his statement filed with the police. The others turned hostile.

 Manoj identified two of the four accused ? Hussein Sheikh and Hassan Sheikh ? before the court. But defence counsel Nayeem Dudhwala asked Manoj how he could identify the two in a mob at night when it assaulted Hargade.

 Manoj could not give a satisfactory answer and the court observed that he was a weak witness and acquitted the accused.

 SC glare on Great Arc scam

 New Delhi: Allegations of financial irregularities 

 in the bicentennial celebrations of the Great Arc have come 

 under the Supreme Court?s scanner, reports our legal correspondent.

 A division bench on Friday issued notices to the Centre, CBI and the Survey of India (SoI) on a PIL that the Centre for Public Interest Litigations filed, alleging Rs 23-crore worth of irregularities in the award of contracts for the event held in April 2002.

 The SoI?s celebrations had marked the mapping of India, north to south, 200 years ago by George Everest, then British surveyor-general for the country. He called the completion of mapping the vast country ?The Great Arc?.

 The petition challenged a Delhi High Court order that declined a directive for a CBI probe in the matter.

 Prashant Bhushan, counsel for the Delhi-based organisation that takes up public issues, contended that the high court had ?erred? in dismissing his petition without ordering a probe, and no action was taken against SoI secretary V.S. Ramamurthy.

 Similar work has been carried on by the SoI, one of the country?s oldest institutions engaged in its topographical survey. It is the only authenticated government agency that is the custodian of all topographical data, which are critical for development activities and security.

 FIR against Anara cops

 Jammu: The crime branch of Jammu 

 and Kashmir police has filed an FIR against four police 

 officers for ?illegal confinement? of former Miss Jammu 

 Anara Gupta, reports our correspondent.

 Safe buildings

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has 

 issued notices to the Centre and several technical bodies 

 on a petition seeking to protect multi-storeyed buildings, 

 especially skyscrapers, from earthquakes and other natural 

 calamities, reports our legal correspondent. The notices 

 were issued on the PIL filed by the Society for Safe Structure, 

 which said structural designs should be adjusted to make 

 the buildings safe.

 Pilgrims die

 Jammu (PTI): Two pilgrims have died 

 of cold near the Vaishno Devi shrine. Sat Paul of New Delhi 

 and Jai Deep Sharma of Gujarat died on their way to it. 

 Haryana scam

 New Delhi: The Haryana primary 

 teachers? recruitment scam on Friday took a new turn with 

 whistleblower IAS officer Sanjeev Kumar telling the Supreme 

 Court that the raids by the CBI to allegedly unearth ?disproportionate 

 assets? was a ploy to browbeat him. Following a petition 

 by Kumar, the court had ordered a CBI probe into the appointment 

 of more than 3,000 teachers allegedly after accepting bribes.

 Family suicide

 Damoh (PTI): A quarrel claimed the 

 lives of three members of a family, including a two-year-old 

 boy, in Muhali village, Madhya Pradesh. The boy was allegedly 

 pushed in front of a Damoh-bound train by his mother, Manju 

 Yadav, before she committed suicide on Thursday, police 

 said. The suicide came after Manju?s mother-in-law left 

 the house after a quarrel and threatened to commit suicide. 

 Manju?s father-in-law then committed suicide. The mother-in-law 

 later returned.

 The European Commission will offer scholarships to over 900 Indian students in 19 universities of the European Union. The grant will cover all expenses, tuition fees, board and lodging.

 Bear in court

 New Delhi, July 12 (PTI): A full-grown bear walked into a courtroom in Tis Hazari today creating a scare, before everyone realised that it was case property.

 The tame animal was produced before the court along with a youth who was arrested for possessing the beast in violation of the wildlife act. The accused, Shaukat Ali, pleaded for leniency saying the animal was his source of livelihood for the past 10 years and he did not know he was committing a crime.

 However, the court sent the bear to the zoo and remanded Ali in judicial custody.

 VHP rubs it in with cry to quit seat 

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Ahmedabad, June 8: His resignation has not satisfied them. VHP leaders are adamant that L.K. Advani give up his Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat.

 There is no question of softening our stand on Advani. We want Advani to resign from the Gandhinagar seat as well as the Somnath trust as he has lost our trust, said Dilip Trivedi, the general secretary of the outfits Gujarat unit.

 Trivedi also said Praveen Togadia ? whose scathing comments were one of the reasons that provoked Advani to yesterday step down as BJP chief ? would not apologise. Advani was hurt because truth hurts. And what Togadia said was a bitter truth, he said, defending Togadia who had called Advani a traitor for praising Pakistans founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

 Asked whether he was under pressure from the Sangh parivar to soften his stand, Togadia said: Who has said this? ... I have not had any communication with the RSS in this connection. No one has told me to soften my stand.

 Togadia said the VHP had not instructed its activists to celebrate Advanis resignation. It is their free will. People of the state may be part of it, too, he added.

 Yesterday, VHP workers burst crackers and beat drums after news of Advanis resignation came in and even washed a road the BJP leader had last month inaugurated to cleanse it.

 In Delhi, VHP senior vice-president Acharya Giriraj Kishore said his outfit wanted a Hindu-minded leader to replace Advani as BJP president. Asked who should take over the reins of the party, he said: It is for the party to decide but he should be Hindutvavadi (Hindu-minded). The Hindus should not be humiliated.

 For the BJP, the attitude of its Sangh parivar sibling is bad news. If he is forced to resign as MP from Gandhinagar, it will amount to the ultimate humiliation of Advani. So our objective is to see to it that anti-Advani sentiments whipped up by the VHP in his constituency die down and he is not subjected to further humiliation, said a senior BJP functionary.

 While the general feeling among BJP leaders in Gujarat is Advani should take back his resignation and lead the party, a senior RSS leader said he feels Advani would eventually resign as MP from Gandhinagar. He has no option as the VHP is not going to soften its stand, the leader added.

 The upheaval that followed Advanis resignation has already cast its shadow on the BJP-ruled Gujarat governments weekly cabinet meeting, which was cancelled today as chief minister Narendra Modi had to rush to Delhi. 

 The developments have also come as a setback for the Gujarat BJP, which recently got a new chief who was in the process of reorganising the state unit.

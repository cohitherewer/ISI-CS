 Sundargarh, April 14: Every night, Bimal Swain?s eyes start itching and become watery. As the three sponge iron plants across a pond near his house at Chadri-Hariharpur in Sundargarh district go into a production overdrive, Swain knows it?s time for trouble.

 Smoke and soot from the plants, carried by a wind, make the children in the house wheeze and the cows restive. ?At times, the smoke is so thick that you can?t see anyone even from a metre,? complains Swain, whose dilapidated house is located about 200 metres from the three plants. 

 With Orissa experiencing a steel rush with a large number of business houses taking the plunge, sponge iron units are coming up at various places in the state. The sponge iron units, which mushroomed in Sundargarh and Keonjhar, require an investment of Rs 7-9 crore.

 But as the state basks in the ?glory? of the steel rush, the sponge iron units seem to be taking their toll on the people of the state, particularly those in Sundargarh. Of the 64 operating sponge iron units in the state, Sundargarh alone has 33. The district bears mute testimony to the continuous and irreversible damage caused to the area?s ecology by the rampant growth of unorganised industrial units. 

 ?We can?t wear any new clothes as coal dust from these plants make them look old and used. Even the utensils are covered with soot,? said Swain. 

 With profit as the only motivating factor, authorities of the plants near Swain?s house don?t seem to be bothered by the rising pollution. 

 In neighbouring Kormunda, where Neepaz Metalliks has set up a 1.4 lakh-tonne sponge iron plant, Jayanti Surin tells her tale of woes. ?The drinking water in my house is full of soot. The situation becomes worse at night when the chimneys of Neepaz Metalliks spew smoke,? she said.

 It?s not just Swain or Surin who are coping with industrial pollution in their backyards. Thousands of people in tribal-dominated Sundargarh district continue to be affected by smoke and soot from the plants. 

 Taking up the cause of villagers, local Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leaders led by Biramitrapur MLA Nihar Surin had led a protest movement against the polluting units. ?It is a nightmare unfolding everywhere, every day,? the MLA said.

 ?The problem starts at night when these units switch off their electrostatic precipitators for a few hours. The area becomes a huge smoke bowl,? said Miraiz Khan, who supplies labourers to several sponge iron units. When The Telegraph visited a few sponge iron units in Sundargarh, it was found that precipitators were not running in several of them.

 Recently, the Orissa Pollution Control Board (OPCB) served notices on 10 polluting units, including Neepaz Metalliks, for not keeping the precipitators on. However, Arun Katruka, executive director of Neepaz Metalliks, said his plant operates all four precipitators throughout the day. 

 Apparently, these industries get away due to the absence of technical surveillance. ?We do not have the infrastructure to keep round-the-clock vigil,? said L.N. Patnaik, chairman of OPCB.

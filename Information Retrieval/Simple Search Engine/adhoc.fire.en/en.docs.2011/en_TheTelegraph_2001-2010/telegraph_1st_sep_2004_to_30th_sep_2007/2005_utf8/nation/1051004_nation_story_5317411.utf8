 All work, no leave? Jawans on patrol in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir 

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: Army headquarters is ordering all officers to screen troops at the unit level for symptoms of stress and fatigue after yesterdays fragging of two junior commissioned officers in Rajouri, the new vice-chief of staff, Lt General S Pattabhiraman, said here today immediately after taking charge.

 Measures to monitor the mental health of soldiers would be enforced at the level of battalions and even smaller units.

 The army views the number of stress and fatigue cases with concern. We will make it compulsory to build up a (psychological) profile (of troops) at the unit level and trace people who are stressed, the vice-chief said.

 Lt General Pattabhiraman, who will be in charge of operations as the vice-chief, said he was also in favour of re-introducing the system of briefing and de-briefing of personnel when they go on leave and after they return to active duty.

 A senior officer based in Srinagar said since the past year, army psychologists based in the corps battle school were being asked to visit camps and carry out regular checks. 

 The idea is not to make life stress-free. A certain amount of stress is a pre-requisite for the tension of working in counter-insurgency areas. But it is important for stress to be managed and directed, the officer said.

 Sources in army headquarters said two areas of concern were the lack of communication between unit commanders and troops beyond combat-related activity and the easy availability of firearms with increased weaponisation.

 Neither of this was necessarily by design. Life in army camps in counter-insurgency areas as in Kashmir is so busy that regular sainik sammelans, that were institutionalised in the army, cannot be held.

 Also, a soldier after going on leave was exposed to a different life and it was necessary to re-induct him into army life. 

 But the standard operating procedure that helps the company commander establish a personal rapport with troops is necessarily observed in breach in a counter insurgency environment.

 Weaponisation has increased because the tempo of counter-insurgency operations has increased. 

 Earlier, weapons were kept in the armoury and were taken out for patrolling or combat. 

 Now every soldier is armed all the time and with it the risk that an altercation can turn violent has increased.

 Poll quota for Muslims

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Aug. 8: Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy today did what predecessor Chandrababu Naidu had said two days ago should be done by announcing that 5 per cent of the seats in local bodies will be reserved for Muslims.

 The move of the ruling Congress comes in the backdrop of the municipal elections that are a month away.

 The government has already given Muslims 5 per cent reservation in government jobs and educational institutions, attracting criticism from the backward classes. The high court then specified procedures to be followed before the quota is implemented.

 Muslims account for 11 per cent of the 7.6 crore population of the state and dominate 17 per cent of the local bodies in Warangal, Kadapa, Anantpur, Hyderabad, Nizamabad, Guntur, Adilabad, Mahboobnagar and Nellore districts. Todays announcement of reservation for the community in politics has caused further heartburn among the backward classes, who feel that the Muslims are taking away a major chunk of seats meant for them.

 The criticism prompted state Congress chief K. Keshav Rao to state that the Muslim quota will not affect the backward classes. The backward classes have nothing to fear. Their share of 29 per cent is well protected. The Muslims will get an additional quota, he said.

 However, backward class leaders point out that the Dalit quota is 15 per cent, tribals benefit from 7 per cent reservation and their community 29 per cent reservation, taking the total to 51 per cent.

 Where will the Muslims be accommodated? The quota has already shot above the 50 per cent limit set by the Supreme Court, said a backward class leader.

 A section of the Congress also apprehends that the move might not bear fruit as the Ayodhya controversy has hardened the minorities against the party.

 This echoes the Charminar MP of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Assaduddin Owaisi. We would rather wait and see than say anything now. Congress members always say one thing and do another. I would rather wait till the measure is actually in force, said Owaisi.

 However, the common Muslim is happy. At least now the ruling parties in the country have taken note of us, said Mohammad Rabbani, an advocate in Hyderabad.

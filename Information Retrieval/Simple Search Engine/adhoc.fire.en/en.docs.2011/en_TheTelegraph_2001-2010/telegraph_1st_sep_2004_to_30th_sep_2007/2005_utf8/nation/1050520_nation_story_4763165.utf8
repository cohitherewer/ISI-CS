 Sharad spits Gujarat fire

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 19: Narendra Modi has again come under fire ? this time too from within the NDA parivar.

 The latest salvo against the Gujarat chief minister has come from Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav, who alleged that the 2002 post-Godhra riots were mainly responsible for the coalitions defeat in the Lok Sabha polls.

 In an interview to a Hindi weekly, Yadav articulated what he used to privately share with newspersons and praised the Manmohan Singh government for reining in elements from the VHP like Praveen Togadia, who was arrested for addressing a trishul rally.

 Earlier this month, two prominent voices from the BJP had criticised Modi. General secretary Pramod Mahajan described the Gujarat violence as a black spot for any civilised society and admitted that it proved a damper to our (the NDAs) resolve to turn India into a riot-free nation.

 Senior leader Sunder Singh Bhandari, who was Gujarat governor in 2002, in an interview to the same weekly had likened the post-Godhra violence to Mahatma Gandhis assassination and blamed Modi for treating the situation lightly.

 Yadav endorsed Bhandaris views. I have always felt strongly about what Bhandari has said now. I spoke to Atal Bihari Vajpayee during the riots but, from his approach, it did not appear that he would echo the NDAs sentiments then or would strictly implement the NDAs agenda. 

 Yadav claimed that he and N. Chandrababu Naidu had resolved to pursue the fight to the finish (until Modi resigned) but the matter fizzled out after the Telugu Desam Party leader issued a separate statement adopting a neutral stand. 

 If there is anything over which we feel sorry in (the) NDA, it is Gujarat, he said.

 NDA sources said Yadavs veiled attack on Vajpayee for not doing enough was an indication that non-BJP leaders had read the writing on the wall. 

 As far as the BJP goes, they have realised Vajpayees days are over. It will either be Advani or a handpicked nominee of the RSS who will call the shots. The Dal, Desam and the other so-called secular parties will have to chart out a long-term plan of whether they wish to stick it out with the BJP or explore other options, a source explained.

 The BJP underplayed Yadavs remarks. There was nothing abnormal or unnatural about it. I have no comments to make but with the NDA and BJP, the situation (in Gujarat) has certainly not been a happy situation, spokesman Arun Jaitley said.

 Yadav also slammed the NDAs divestment policy and said it was another reason for the coalitions defeat. That is why as the civil aviation minister, I did not allow the disinvestment of airports, Air-India and Indian Airlines.

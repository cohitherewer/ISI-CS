 Panel firm on poll date

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: The Congress appears to have reconciled to the four-phase polls in Bihar after chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon ruled out any change in the October 18 to November 19 schedule.

 There would be no revision of the election schedule and we have announced it after giving due consideration to religious festivals and all other aspects, Tandon, who is in Bihar to assess poll preparedness, told reporters.

 It is mandatory for the commission to complete the election process within six months of the dissolution of the House and, in Bihars case, it expires on November 22, Tandon added.

 The statement came before a high-level delegation of Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Nationalist Congress Party and CPM leaders met poll panel officials in Delhi this evening to press for a revised schedule.

 The delegation, which included railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh, submitted a memorandum to election commissioner Navin Chawla requesting either a single-day poll or in two phases because of a number of religious festivals during October-November and to ensure high voter turnout.

 We? would request the commission to kindly reconsider the dates of polls in the interest of free and fair elections in the state as also maximum voter turnout, Singh and Laloo Prasad said after the 15-minute meeting with Chawla and two other commission officials.

 The memorandum also said October would not be suitable for holding elections as many parts of Bihar could be hit by floods. 

 The leaders also requested the commission to issue photo identity cards to all voters and said if any voter does not have the card, alternative arrangements should be made to ensure their franchise.

 Chawla, sources said, assured the leaders that their request would be considered by the three-member commission after Tandon and commissioner N. Gopalswami returned to the capital from Bihar.

 The Congress, however, did not appear to be convinced by the poll panels assurance.

 Party chief Sonia Gandhi has already scheduled a stocktaking meeting with her colleagues, including Singh, the general secretary in charge of Bihar, Ambika Soni, Ahmed Patel and Janardhan Dwivedi tomorrow morning.

 Apart from poll-related matters, Sonia is expected to discuss with them and take a decision whether or not to stick to the October 20-22 schedule for holding the Congress plenary session. Sources said Sonia might consider deferring the session.

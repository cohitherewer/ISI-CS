 CBI closes in on CMs? favourite 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 21: The CBI has knocked on the doors of Akhand Pratap Singh, a retired IAS officer who continued to enjoy the trust of several chief ministers despite being voted among the most corrupt bureaucrats in Uttar Pradesh by his colleagues.

 In an early-morning operation, the CBI carried out raids in 16 places across three states.

 The former Uttar Pradesh chief secretary has been linked to as many as 15 properties worth crores in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal?s Nainital, the agency said.

 Singh was last given a clean chit by chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav in October 2003. Like his predecessors, the Samajwadi Party chief had stonewalled attempts by the central government to investigate the IAS officer and turned down requests to let the CBI run a check on him.

 However, a Lucknow journalist went to the Supreme Court to oppose a three-month extension that Mulayam Singh gave to the officer. Singh was finally replaced in December 2003 before the extension expired.

 Once Singh lost his post, the CBI moved in because it no longer needed permission from the state government to launch a probe. After a preliminary inquiry, the CBI registered a case against Singh accusing him of possessing assets disproportionate to his income. 

 The CBI raids this morning have led the sleuths to suspect that Singh had also stashed away a significant chunk of his ?earnings? in overseas banks. ?He has made several private trips abroad,? a CBI officer said, pointing out that the retired bureaucrat also appeared to own a ?fleet of vehicles?.

 Singh, he said, had amassed prime properties in the names of his wife Neelam and two daughters.

 The list of 15 properties includes a residential flat and a commercial flat in the upscale Vasant Vihar, a farmhouse in south Delhi, three farmhouses, a guesthouse and a plot on which an international school and an engineering college are under construction in Uttaranchal and residential as well as commercial properties across Uttar Pradesh.

 Sources said the Centre had tried to formally investigate the officer who had managed to be on the right side of many Uttar Pradesh chief ministers ? from Rajnath Singh and Mayavati to Mulayam Singh ? after state bureaucrats complained to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 

 The Intelligence Bureau that was asked to report on the charges backed the complaints.

 When the Centre sought permission from the Rajnath Singh government, sources said, the state administration reported that a vigilance inquiry was already under way.

 The next chief minister, Mayavati, too, got a request and gave a similar reply.

 When Mulayam Singh came to power, he appointed Singh chief secretary barely two months before the official?s date of retirement.

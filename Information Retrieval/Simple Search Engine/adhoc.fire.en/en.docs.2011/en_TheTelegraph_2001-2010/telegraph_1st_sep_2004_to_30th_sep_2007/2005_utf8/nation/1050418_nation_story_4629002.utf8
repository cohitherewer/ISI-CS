 Orissa call for uniform VAT 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 17: The Orissa government is in a spot over its decision to opt for the value-added tax regime.

 Implementing VAT in letter and spirit can prove costly for the state, feel officials in the finance department. They apprehend that non-uniformity of the tax structure will divert its trade to states like West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. While Bengal and Andhra Pradesh have given the green light to VAT, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand are yet to do so.

 The state government has imposed a four per cent tax on items like flour, semolina, white flour, besan, paddy, rice, sagu, raw jute, salt, unprocessed green-leaf tea and khandasari. But Bengal has kept these items in the category of exempted goods. 

 Finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei said Bengal and Andhra Pradesh had been charging a 12.5 per cent tax on molasses, narcotics and rectified spirit while Orissa levied a 20 per cent tax on these items. Similarly, Andhra Pradesh has removed maize, ragi, bajra, jowar and husk from the VAT list. 

 Orissa imports a lot of goods from Andhra Pradesh and Bengal and the absence of a uniform tax structure would not only cause trade diversion and consequent revenue loss to the government but also adversely affect local manufacturers.

 Aggrieved by this, Ghadei lodged a protest with the empowered committee of the finance ministry in Delhi. ?Orissa is the only non-UPA state to implement VAT. But now I am pained to note that certain states have violated the recommendations of the empowered committee,? Ghadei said.

 The VAT panel, which met in Delhi under the chairmanship of Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta yesterday, would sit again on April 25 and 26 to resolve anomalies in the tax structure.

 Dasgupta said there had been complaints that certain companies increased prices, which were not commensurate with the VAT regime. Besides, prices of certain other commodities have come down to the expected level.

 Pointing out the discrepancies, Ghadei said Orissa, which has so far gone by the book in fixing prices of VAT items, will suffer if the other states do not adhere to the guidelines prescribed by the empowered committee.

 Bar girls leave city

 Mumbai, June 5: With just a day to go for dance bars to implement the state government ban on them, 10,000-odd bar girls have been forced to leave town or go underground. 

 Although the ban is not total ? it asks dance bars to separate the dance floor from the area where alcohol is served ? it will lead many dance bars to down shutters, at least temporarily. 

 About 5,000 women have migrated to Hyderabad on contracts, said Varsha Kale, who heads the Indian Bar Girls Association. There are unlicensed ladies bars in Hyderabad where some of the girls have gone. Others will work in orchestra bars where female singers are employed and which enjoy occasional licences (when performances are held). There are several underground bars, too, where some of the girls will go and some of them may be pushed directly into prostitution, she said. Some bars in Hyderabad are asking for dance floor licence. 

 Kale informed that around 1,000 women have left for Bangalore to work on contracts in about 150 bars, 60 of which are licensed. 

 Many others are leaving for their homes in Agra and Bengal. Several women, who were from Sonagachhi in Calcutta, are reported to have gone back, she added. 

 Kale said bar dancers going to perform in another town on contract was an established practice. They would go on a one-to-three months contract and get paid about Rs 10,000 to 15,000 per month. Since their food and stay would be taken care of, many women went willingly as they could save the entire amount.

 But now, with so many women out of their jobs, the supply is more than the demand. The women are being forced to go for less money, Kale said. 

 Many are also queuing up to go to the Gulf, where a three-month contract in Abu Dhabi, Muscat or Dubai would fetch around Rs 3 lakh. But now they are settling for half the amount. The bar girls are a frightened lot, she said.

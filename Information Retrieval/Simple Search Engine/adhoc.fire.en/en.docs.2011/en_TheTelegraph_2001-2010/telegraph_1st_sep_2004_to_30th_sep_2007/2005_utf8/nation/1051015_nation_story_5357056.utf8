 Tangdhar, Oct. 14: A few terrible minutes of tragedy have done for the army what a slew of people-friendly programmes had failed to achieve in a decade and a half.

 From Kashmir Valleys most hated and feared villain a week ago, the soldier has turned hero and saviour.

 Fauj aur air force khuda ka roop ban gayi hai. Agar woh nahin hote to hum bach nahin sakte the (the army and the air force have turned God for us. If they hadnt been here, we wouldnt have survived), Aijaz Ahmed said at a relief camp here, reflecting the tectonic shift in the militarys image.

 It is only the troops who have been able to reach the remotest quake-ravaged areas, provide relief and console the terror-stricken villagers. It has won them the trust of the common man that had been so hard to gain all these years in the face of the militants propaganda and terror.

 I took a ride in an army truck from my village, said Bashir at the camp. Earlier, I would hide whenever I spotted a soldiers uniform.

 Send relief through the army, not through government officials, said another victim. Those people take it all to their own homes. They are crooks. Jawan hi awaam ki bhalai ki koshish kar rahe hain (the soldier alone is working for the good of all).

 Before the quake, it was different because the location of the region is very strategic and everyone was viewed with suspicion. The people looked at us with angry eyes. Now they look at us as saviours, said Havildar Rajib Ghosh before turning to a woman holding an infant in her arms.

 Bukhar hua (is the baby running a temperature)? he asked her.

 As this correspondent reached Tangdhar, it was raining and the temperature was falling. None from the civil administration was there; only army personnel ? their uniforms and faces smeared in mud ? mingled with the victims, seeking information on the damage in the 42 villages that have been completely destroyed in the area.

 Brigadier B.P.S. Hundal of 15 Corps shrugged off the accolades. 

 No specific orders have been given to the men. Each soldier is merely acting on his own, he said. The people need help and we are trying to provide relief. We have airlifted the injured to hospital and, wherever possible, dropped food and other items.

 The army has so far established nearly 40 relief camps in Tangdhar and Uri sectors. The base hospital has treated over 200 people. Nearly 1,000 have been evacuated by air and road to safer places. Tonnes of food, tents and medicines have been air-dropped at remote, quake-affected locations.

 The army has opened dispensaries and field hospitals across the region to help the distressed. There is, however, little news from the 15 inaccessible villages of Tangdhar.

 We have sent teams on foot; an air survey has already been carried out. If there are survivors, they will be brought here and treated, a jawan said.

 Relief is pouring in but we need more tents, another added. Tin sheets are also needed desperately, but nobody seems to realise their importance. Its going to start snowing soon.

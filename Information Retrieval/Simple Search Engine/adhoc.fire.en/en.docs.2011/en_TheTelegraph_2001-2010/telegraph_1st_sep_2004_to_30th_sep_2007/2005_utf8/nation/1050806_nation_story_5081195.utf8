 Kang back after Buta request

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Aug. 5: Bihar governor Buta Singh has persuaded chief secretary G.S. Kang to rejoin work, barely a few days after the Congress veteran had spoken about shifting the bureaucrat.

 Kang had gone on long leave on July 29 and was to leave for Punjab tomorrow but Singh called him up ? possibly more than once between last evening and this morning ? to make him change his mind.

 Kang had alleged that the chief secretarys office was being ignored in taking crucial decisions and the flashpoint came with last weeks transfer of 17 IPS officers, which was notified without his knowledge.

 Singh, who returned from Delhi yesterday, triggered rumours about the chief secretary rejoining his office when he asked this morning: Is an official replaced simply because he is on leave? Later, in the afternoon, Kang drove into the porch of the state secretariat.

 I had raised a point that the chief secretary was being bypassed in taking decisions. Now that issue has been sorted out. The governor has promised me that my prestige and position as chief secretary will in no way be compromised. I think that is sufficient for my rejoining work, Kang said.

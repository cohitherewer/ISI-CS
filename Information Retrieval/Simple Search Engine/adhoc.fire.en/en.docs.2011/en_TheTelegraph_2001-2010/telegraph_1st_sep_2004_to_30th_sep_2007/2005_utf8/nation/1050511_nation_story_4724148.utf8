 Minister toes UPA line

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 10: Rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh today said his party chief Laloo Prasad Yadav should not have gone public with his accusation of bias against the election commissioners that has left the RJD isolated within the ruling alliance.

 ?Lalooji should have taken UPA leaders into confidence,? Singh said, a day after the government distanced itself from the railway ministers demand for the resignation of election commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswamy in the wake of IAS officer L.V. Saptharishis allegations.

 Saptharishi, who was an observer for the May 2004 election in Chhapra where Laloo Prasad was a contestant, had accused Tandon and Gopalaswamy of acting at the behest of the BJP and countermanding the poll. 

 Singh, under whose ministry the Council for Advancement of Peoples Action and Rural Technology falls, dismissed BJP leader Arun Jaitleys allegations that Saptharishis outbursts were part of a quid pro quo for an extension. The Capart director-general retires in July.

 Referring to Jaitleys claim that his ministrys records between April 30 and May 6 would prove the quid pro quo, Singh said he was making all documents for the period public to ?rubbish? the allegations. 

 The RJD leader said he had on April 7 forwarded to the ?competent authority? a January 19 Capart resolution that proposed a three-year fixed term for the director-general. ?The resolution was meant to ensure efficiency and it was not done with any individual in mind,? he said.

 Singh said he had come to know about Saptharishis letter from journalists. 

 ?Just as I landed at Chennai airport on May 6, a lady TV journalist asked for my response on Laloojis press conference in Patna that day about the Saptharishi letter. The IAS officer never informed me about it in advance,? the minister said. ?I would have advised him against going public.?

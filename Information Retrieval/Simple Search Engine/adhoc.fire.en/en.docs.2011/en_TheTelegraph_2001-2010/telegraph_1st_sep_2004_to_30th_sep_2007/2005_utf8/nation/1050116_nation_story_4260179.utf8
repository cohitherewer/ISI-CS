 Twin attacks in Kashmir capital

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Jan. 15: Two militant attacks within two hours rattled the Kashmir capital this afternoon. 

 The first target was a civic poll rally by Opposition National Conference candidate Ghulam Ahmed Hakeem. ?The NC candidate for the Zadibal ward was returning home after filing his nomination papers. He was accompanied by a group of supporters when unidentified militants hurled a grenade, injuring 16 people, including the local station house officer and a cop,? said a police officer. Hakeem was unhurt.

 The injured were taken to the nearby Soura Medical Institute, where one person died. 

 Civic polls are being held in the state after 27 years. Polling is scheduled for February 1. 

 Various separatist groups have called for a boycott of the civic polls. But this is the first attack on a civic poll rally here. The administration has beefed up security following the attack. No group has claimed responsibility for it yet.

 Two hours after the first attack around 2.15 pm, two fidayeen stormed an indoor stadium at Gogjibagh, in the heart of the Kashmir capital. 

 Police said a sub-inspector of the Central Reserve Police Force was injured in the initial encounter between the militants, who are now holed up in the passport office located in the indoor stadium complex.

 Security forces have surrounded the area and floodlights have been put up to spot any movement. 

 ?The security forces are taking recourse to speculative firing in order to pin point the hiding place of the two militants inside the complex,? said a senior police officer at the spot. 

 The indoor stadium, occupied by the CRPF, is in a high-security zone as it is adjacent to the Bakshi Stadium, the venue of the Republic Day function here. 

 This is the second such attack in 10 days. On January 7, militants had attacked the income-tax headquarters here.

 Alert on Nepal border

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Feb. 3: Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal have started beefing up security along the porous border with Nepal following the proclamation of emergency in the kingdom. 

 Both states suspect a crackdown on Maoists in Nepal will spark massive infiltration of Nepali militants into India. 

 ?The intelligence network in the border districts has been activated. Instructions have been issued to the superintendents of police to keep vigil...,? said Aloke Sinha, the Uttar Pradesh principal secretary.

 Sources said checking has been intensified on routes to the seven border districts. Five companies of armed forces have been sent to the areas.

 Uttaranchal has three districts ? Rudrapur, Champawat and Pithoragarh ? bordering west Nepal. The 275-km border in the hilly terrain of Uttaranchal has made the state vulnerable to infiltration.

 ?We are keeping a close watch on the situation on the border and have kept security forces on their toes, especially in the sensitive areas,? said director-general of police Kanchan Choudhary Bhattacharya. 

 Reinforcements of the Provincial Armed Constabulary and the Sashastra Seva Bal, which guard the border, have been deployed.

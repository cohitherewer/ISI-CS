 Atal draws House battle line 

 - Change in command?

 New Delhi, July 24: If boycott was the Oppositions theme for the budget session, all-out attack seems to be the mantra for the monsoon sitting.

 This time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ? till now overshadowed by the leader of Opposition L.K. Advani in parliamentary matters ? is keen to play a more active role, sources said.

 The former Prime Minister is acutely aware that the Left has been taking over the Oppositions space, thanks to the BJPs House boycott during the last session and the problems within the Sangh parivar. He feels there is little point in functioning as an ornamental chairperson of the National Democratic Alliance and wants to get cracking.

 Advanis strategy was to boycott Parliament. He believed that this was the most potent way of denying the United Progressive Alliance government its legitimacy and status. 

 His argument, articulated by BJP spokespersons, was that if the main Opposition bloc stayed out of the House, anything the government said or did ? policy statements, passage of bills or whatever ? would lack the weight of debate and discussion and would be meaningless.

 Vajpayee did not hide his disapproval. At a couple of meetings of the BJP parliamentary party, he suggested lifting the boycott. But it turned out to be a cry in the wilderness as his loyalist, Jaswant Singh ? who is the leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha ? went along with Advani.

 With Advanis authority, both as BJP president and the leader of Opposition, undermined by the RSS and some leaders of his own party, Vajpayee has decided to pick up the baton, the sources said.

 A meeting of coalition leaders at his residence this morning proposed to bring an adjournment motion against the Centre for its failure to implement the Supreme Courts directive striking down the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act.

 The act, in force only in Assam, places the responsibility of proving someone an illegal immigrant on the accuser. Elsewhere in the country, the onus lies with the accused.

 The Centre plans to set up a group of ministers to examine the implications of the apex courts order. 

 But the BJPs deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, warned that the Opposition alliance will not tolerate any effort to dilute the Supreme Courts decision which would help in stopping the illegitimate intrusion into the countrys northeastern states.

 The meeting also decided to move a motion against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for praising British colonial rule in a speech at Oxford University.

 Swaraj said the Opposition will try to table it under Rule 184 in the Lok Sabha, which entails voting, and Rule 167 in the Rajya Sabha. 

 BJP sources said if the motion is admitted, the Left may be forced to support it. For, the Left had also been critical of Singh for suggesting that the British rule in India ought to be re-evaluated because some good had come of it.

 We want a full discussion on the speech, Swaraj said.

 With an eye to the Bihar elections, the party will demand a discussion ? also under Rule 184 ? on the revocation of Presidents rule in the state. The BJP will argue that the move smacked of Laloo Prasad Yadavs jungle raaj.

 We are sure that non-NDA parties like the DMK and the Samajwadi Party will back us on this, a BJP leader said.

 But Vajpayees attempt to put up a unity show ran aground with the Shiv Sena and the Trinamul Congress staying away from the meeting.

 The BJP and the Sena have been competing for the post of the leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly after Sena legislator Narayan Ranes resignation. 

 We are trying to find out what the Senas problem is. Hopefully, we will work out some kind of a compromise, a BJP leader said.

 Trinamul, the sources claimed, was busy with its own programmes in Bengal.

 Miandad on Dawood

 New Delhi, June 18 (PTI): Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad today admitted to having close family relations with Dawood Ibrahim but remained non-committal about when the marriage of his son with the dons daughter would take place.

 If it has to happen, it will happen. It is not something that can remain hidden from public eye. The reports that the marriage will happen in June or July are false. I will myself inform everyone when it happens, Miandad told STAR News from Karachi.

 On his relations with Dawood, who was recently declared a global terrorist by the UN, the former Pakistan coach said: My wife and Dawoods wife are like sisters and his wife is, in fact, a relative of my mother.

 It (the marriage) is our personal matter and I do not let anyone interfere in my family matters.

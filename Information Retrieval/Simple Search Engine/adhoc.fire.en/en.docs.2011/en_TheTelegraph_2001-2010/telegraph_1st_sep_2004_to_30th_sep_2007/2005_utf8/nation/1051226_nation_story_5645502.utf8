 To altar, a year after escape

 - marriage on disaster anniversary eve

 STEWART PAYNE

 London, Dec. 25: Roland Buerk, son of BBC journalist Michael Buerk, has married the woman he believes saved him from death in the Asian tsunami a year ago.

 Buerk, who is also a journalist, and his girlfriend Anna Moore deliberately chose to marry on the eve of the anniversary of a disaster that almost claimed both their lives.

 It seemed appropriate, he said. We both know how fortunate we are and we wanted to mark the occasion with something positive, something happy.

 On Boxing Day last year, the couple, both 32, were in their hotel room in the Sri Lankan coastal town of Unawatuna. Buerk, who was on leave from his job as the BBCs Bangladesh correspondent, was still in bed in the ground floor room of their beachfront hotel. 

 Anna was up, dressed in pyjama bottoms and T-shirt. She heard a commotion outside and saw the wave approaching, said Buerk. 

 She yelled at me and I jumped out of bed dressed just in boxer shorts. We reached the door just as the wave smashed in through our bedroom window. I dont think I would be here if I had still been in bed. 

 They ran into an outside corridor where they were swept up by rushing water. They were carried to the back of the hotel where they managed to grab a tree, still rooted in the ground despite the force of the torrent. 

 We held on with our hands and wedged ourselves by pushing our feet against an adjacent wall. But the water was rising all the time, the tree was bending and debris was swirling past us.

 Anna had managed to get a better grip than me. I was unable to hold on and Anna, realising this, let go as well. She could have stayed where she was but she struck out and we managed to grab hold of each other.

 We clung on for dear life. The water was full of everything you could imagine. There was furniture, refrigerators and motorcycles. The force of the water was terrifying.

 They were swept further back and managed to grab hold of a pillar on the verandah of a house that had survived the tsunamis impact. They remained there until the water subsided.

 Moore, a clinical psychologist who is working in social science research in Dhaka where her husband is based, said: I cannot claim it was a conscious decision to leave the comparative safety of the tree. It was all so chaotic and so quick. But I knew I wanted to be with Roland.

 Buerk and Moore were holidaying with three friends, Tom Tanner, Kate Studd and Sarah White. They were on the floor above us and were trapped in their rooms, said Buerk. 

 We were reunited later in the day and it was only too apparent by then just how lucky we were to have all survived.

 The three were guests at the wedding, at St John the Evangelist, Merrow, near Guildford, where Buerk was once a choirboy and just a short distance from his family home. His best man was his twin brother Simon. 

 In the immediate aftermath, Buerk filed reports back to the BBC on a borrowed mobile telephone. We lost everything apart from what little we were wearing. We managed to get some clothes and a day or so later we walked to the larger town of Gaul. 

 Buerk said he had no time to contact his parents, who were holidaying in South Africa. They would have heard my reports so they would have known we were all OK, he said.

 Buerk and Moore, who started going out together 12 years ago when they were both students at Birmingham University, said: A year ago we had no specific plans to marry although I think we knew we would someday.

 But the events of December 26, 2004, have focused our minds to an extent and we started to plan our wedding last February. We do not dwell on the tsunami but it is always there. I think we thought: Why wait any longer? Live for now.

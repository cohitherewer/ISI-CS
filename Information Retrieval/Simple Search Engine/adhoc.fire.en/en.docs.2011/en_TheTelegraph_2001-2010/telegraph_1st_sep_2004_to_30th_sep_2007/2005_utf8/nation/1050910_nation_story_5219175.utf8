 Socialite Mulayam takes socialism lesson

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Mulayam: Party time

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: An evening of cocktails with Bill Clinton and his in-house glamour brigade led by the Bachchans has not killed Mulayam Singh Yadavs appetite for lessons in socialism.

 The Uttar Pradesh chief minister will be off to Chitrakoot tomorrow for a four-day party session on the theoretical and practical aspects of socialism. With him will be all his cabinet ministers, MLAs and senior party leaders.

 The Samajwadi Party has organised the Samajwadi Prashikshan Shivir (socialist training camp) to educate party workers not just from Uttar Pradesh, but from Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi and Jharkhand, too.

 But veteran socialists ? including some who have agreed to speak at the convention ? have only scorn for the session and the partys socialist pretensions. Its a party not of socialists but of socialites, scoffed Prof. Rizwan Qaisar of Jamia Millia Islamia.

 Mulayams media adviser, Trilok Singh Mehta, however, was a picture of earnestness as he delivered a briefing.

 Its a national-level training camp. Such camps are organised from time to time by our party to create awareness about the socialist movement in India and to make our cadre aware of the partys socialist principles and ideology, he said. The theoretical aspects of socialism are discussed in detail. It is an intense ideological training.

 The party will present an array of leaders ? Reoti Raman Singh, Janeshwar Mishra, Ram Gopal Yadav ? who have been completely overshadowed in recent times by Amar Singh. The high-profile general secretary, however, is never mentioned when Samajwadi Party workers rattle off the names of leaders involved in educating the cadre.

 The party has invited academics, too. The veteran socialist, Prof. Anand Kumar of Jawaharlal Nehru Universitys sociology department, will be speaking on the problems of higher education in India and unemployment.

 The professor is absolutely clear that the Samajwadi Party today has no connection to the socialist movement to which it traces its ancestry.

 The Samajwadi Party leaders defend their hobnobbing with the big industrialists and film stars. They argue that to counter globalisation, you have to align with the domestic capitalist. This is bad logic, Prof. Kumar said.

 Prof. Qaisar is even more scathing. Mulayams party cannot be called a Samajwadi party. What does Mulayam have in common with Jaiprakash Narain or Ram Manohar Lohia now? He should party with Amar Singh and Amitabh Bachchan and drop all pretensions of being a socialist.

 Tech touch to BJP bash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 24: Pramod Mahajan, who made a flamboyant information technology minister in the Vajpayee cabinet, is living up to his reputation.

 The BJP is Marching Ahead ? the theme of the partys silver jubilee celebrations starting Monday ? with Mahajan holding his high-tech banner aloft.

 The BJP general secretary has been camping here to supervise the arrangements at the Bandra Reclamation grounds, where the party was born 25 years ago.

 He today inaugurated a website, www.bjp25.org, which gives information about the five-day birthday bash.

 Posters are pass?, a 30-second MMS clip will publicise a three-day convention and a public meeting at Shivaji Park. Over a dozen touch-screen kiosks have been placed at Rajat Jayanti Nagar ? as the Bandra grounds is to be rechristened.

 The party has also arranged 100 computers equipped with high-speed Internet connectivity to cater to the media. The conventions media cell in-charge, Atul Shah, said the party would also try to webcast the event.

 With Mumbai hosting the celebrations, there is no way the BJP can keep out Bollywood. Art director Nitin Desai, who has created opulent sets for period films like Devdas and Lagaan, will design the main dais and the convention centre.

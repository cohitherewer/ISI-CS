 Buddha steps up infotech no-strike drive

 OUR BUREAU

 Bhattacharjee: New front

Delhi/Calcutta, Oct. 17: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today looked set to take the campaign against strikes in the information technology sector to the apex policy making body of his party.

 I am not going to budge from the stand I have taken on the strike, Bhattacharjee said. But let me first discuss the issue within my party.

 The chief minister is expected to urge the CPM politburo next week to review the relevance of strikes as a form of protest, especially in the infotech sector that has started attracting investors to Bengal.

 Officials said Bhattacharjee would raise in the politburo the fallout of the Citu-sponsored September 29 strike, which did not spare the infotech sector. 

 Since then, the chief minister has convened a meeting of the infotech industry, where he promised that there would not be any more strikes in the sector.

 The two-day politburo meeting from October 25 in Delhi will seriously review strike calls, a CPM leader said in the capital, adding that Bhattacharjee had already taken up with the leadership the need for clear guidelines.

 Bhattacharjee said the current situation merited a review of the relevance of strikes. We have to review whether these strike calls are helping us or not, he told a television channel. Politically, I will take up the matter at the highest level. IT is not like jute or engineering. 

 Bengal CPM secretary Anil Biswas suggested that the state unit would be with Bhattacharjee. If and when the chief minister chooses to raise the issue of strikes and a review, I am sure there will be a discussion, Biswas said.

 Bhattacharjee will try to impress upon the leadership that the IT industry has already been defined as a public utility outside the purview of strikes and bandhs and now the leadership must rein in Citu and its allies, officials said. 

 The politburo meeting is expected to see a tussle between the Citu faction led by M.K. Pandhe and the group supporting Bhattacharjee. 

 Pandhe has been in a minority within the party since Bhattacharjee returned from his business trip to Singapore and Indonesia and the CPM leadership supported the chief ministers efforts to woo investment for Bengal. 

 The Citu president has cited the latest issue of Peoples Democracy, the party mouthpiece, as proof of the CPMs support for his argument. 

 The issue carries the full text of Pandhes letter to the Union labour secretary stressing the need to form unions in the IT sector and an article by Karat defending the strike.

 But Bhattacharjee seems to have his share of supporters within the politburo on the IT controversy.

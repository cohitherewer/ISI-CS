 Thanksgiving for tsunami help

 Porayar (PTI): Residents of Pattinacherri 

 village in Pondicherry, who resumed full-fledged fishing 

 on Monday, distributed their entire catch to the people 

 in the Karaikal region as a thanksgiving act for their help 

 during the tsunami disaster.

 The fishermen have not ventured into the sea for more than three months after the tsunami on December 26.

 Although Pondicherry chief minister N. Rengasami had formally inaugurated fishing activities two weeks ago, rains prevented the fishermen from venturing into the sea for more than a week.

 Sunshine on Tuesday saw the fishermen go out into the sea in mechanised boats. After returning to the shore, they decided not to sell the first catch but offer it to the people.

 The fish was distributed in villages like Kilinjalmedu, Karaikalmedu and other areas.

 HC notice to St Stephen?s 

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court on 

 Wednesday sent a notice to St Stephen?s College on an allegation 

 that it has given a go-by to an ordinance passed by Delhi 

 University.

 The notices have been issued to the college, its principal Anil Wilson and Delhi University. Justice Gita Mital posted the matter for hearing on May 17.

 The petition filed by two teachers and a non-teaching staff of the college has sought the court?s directive to the university to take appropriate action against the college for not implementing ordinance XV (D), framed by the university. The ordinance prohibits and provides punishment for sexual harassment of women.

 The petitioner?s advocates submitted that the ordinance was framed to effectively deal with the issue of sexual harassment following guidelines provided by the Supreme Court in 1997.

 The petitioners alleged that the principal had stopped the process of lodging complaints on the grounds that the university?s ordinance was not applicable to a minority-run institution.

 ?The principal has desperately tried to link this issue with the ?Christian character? and ?minority character? of the institution,? the petitioners said, quoting a reply from the principal when the faculty had requested him to reconsider his decision. 

 Mild tremor in Latur

 Mumbai (PTI): An earthquake of slight 

 intensity shook Latur district in Maharashtra on Tuesday

 Temple feat

 A foundation spokesperson said the temple would cater to 

 the needs of the Hindu population in Holland where ?they 

 can experience the original Hindu culture and faith?.

 US fellowship

 Houston (PTI): Five Americans of 

 Indian origin have received the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation 

 fellowships. The recipients include authors Pico Iyer and 

 Rohinton Mistry. The Guggenheim Foundation, a New York-based 

 organisation devoted to furthering the development of scholars 

 and artistes, has awarded $7,112,000 among 186 fellows.

 has ordered a judicial probe into the hooch tragedy that 

 claimed 22 lives in Bangalore rural district on Tuesday.

 seven-year-old boy, who died on Monday in a municipal school,

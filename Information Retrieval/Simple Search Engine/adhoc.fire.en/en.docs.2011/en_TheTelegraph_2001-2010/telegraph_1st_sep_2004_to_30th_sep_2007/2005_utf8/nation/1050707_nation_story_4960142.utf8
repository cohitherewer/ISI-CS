 Mumbai, July 6 (PTI): Industrialists requests have prompted the VHP and the Bajrang Dal not to include Mumbai in their Maharashtra bandh tomorrow.

 The VHP will not hold any bandh in the metropolis as some industrialists and institutions have requested us not to have bandh in Mumbai as it affects the livelihood of lakhs of people, VHP western zone chief Venkatesh Abdev said. The bandh has been called in protest against the Ayodhya attack.

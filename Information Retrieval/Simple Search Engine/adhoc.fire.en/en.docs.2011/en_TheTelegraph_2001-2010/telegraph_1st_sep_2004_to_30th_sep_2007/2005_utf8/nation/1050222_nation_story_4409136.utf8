 Laloo magic shows wear and tear

 UTTAM SENGUPTA

 (Top) Laloo Prasad, 

 Nitish Kumar 

 Chapra, Feb. 21: In ?normal? times, the elder brother would not have required any prop. But this time round, ?bade bhai? Udit Rai, a minister of long standing and a veteran leader, needed Laloo Prasad Yadav to canvass for him. If Rai is fighting with his back to the wall in a constituency considered to be a Yadav bastion, the signs look all but auspicious for the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 There are other indications. While the core of the crowd is enthusiastic, lapping up every stale phrase and oft-repeated witticism from the star speaker ? hum mooli hain kya ki ukhad phekoge? (are we radishes that you will uproot us?) ? clapping frequently, jumping up and down, others listen quietly with little or no expression on their faces. When Laloo Prasad leaves, they too hurry out but there is nothing to suggest animation. It is this failure of the star campaigner to enthuse people that is worrying die-hard RJD supporters.

 Crowds are equally unresponsive at the meetings of other parties, except when they take a dig at Laloo Prasad. ?How long do you get electricity here in Chapra?? asked Nitish Kumar, addressing a meeting a couple of hours after Laloo Prasad had left. A section of the crowd screamed back, ?two hours?, while others vociferously protested, saying ?half an hour? was more like it. But ask Lalooji about electricity, deadpanned Nitish, and all that he?d tell you is you should oil your lathi (stick) well. The crowd guffaws. Lalooji gives the same answer to everything, Nitish continued. ?Shiksha ki kharaab sthiti hai, Lalooji kahenge tel lagao; unse boliye ki doctor nahin hain, to phir bolenge ki tel lagao.? (Tell Lalooji that the state of education is bad and he will ask you to relax. Tell him that there are no doctors, and he will again tell you to relax.)

 The challenge, ironically, comes from within the Yadav community.

 The Dal (U) candidate, Ram Pravesh Rai, a former RJD loyalist, is a Yadav and so is a BJP rebel, Jhariman Rai. The Lok Janshakti Party has put up a Rajput candidate, Jai Narayan Singh Solanki, a former BJP loyalist but, significantly, the latter is far from confident of getting the votes of his own community.

 This is borne out by what the LJP candidate?s son, Ramakant Singh, has to say. ?We were waiting for Laloo Prasad to arrive here and canvass,? he said, ?now that he has done so, we will surely start receiving support of the Rajputs.? The Yadavs, he said, would be strutting around and speaking endlessly about Laloo Prasad. This, Singh hoped, would cause a reaction among the Rajputs and prompt them to rally round one of their own. 

 ?Just as the BJP would have lost ground if the Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, had campaigned in Bihar, the RJD is losing ground in Chapra, wherever Laloo Prasad is turning up,? he claimed with a chuckle.

 Implicit in what he said was the admission that caste-blocs in Bihar are no longer casting their votes in predictable patterns and in favour of caste candidates. Rajputs in Chapra could well be supporting Ram Pravesh Rai, a Yadav, as long as he is seen to be in a position to upset the sitting RJD MLA, Udit Rai.

 The fact that the Dal (U) candidate happens to be the chairman of the Chapra zilla parishad is also significant. Laloo Prasad had stalled panchayat elections for almost 13 years. But once elections were held in the state for local bodies, it unleashed the political ambition of the ?empowered? Yadavs. A large number of well-off Yadavs won in the local body elections two years ago and many of them now feel that the time has come for making a bid for a seat in the Assembly.

 Marginalisation of the upper castes, who have been pushed to a corner, it would appear, has made ?backward unity? redundant.

 Similarly, with the defeat of the NDA in the general election and the threat of communalism ?receding?, the Yadav-Muslim alliance, too, no longer appears necessary on the ground; which explains why Laloo Prasad is trying so hard to hark back to Ayodhya, Godhra, riots and the time when he had arrested Lal Krishna Advani?s rath yatra. This actually formed the substance of what the RJD chief had to say in Chapra, leaving the lesser leaders to list the achievements of his government.

 New ground-rules are being made in this election and new groupings are emerging to break the mould. It remains to be seen if in this state of flux, old strategies will work.

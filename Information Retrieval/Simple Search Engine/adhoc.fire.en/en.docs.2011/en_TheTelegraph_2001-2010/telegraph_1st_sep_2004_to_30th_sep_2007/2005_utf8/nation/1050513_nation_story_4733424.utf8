 Teacher tastes caste stick

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 12: The headmistress of a school in West Bengal Nadia has been suspended on charges of making snide remarks about students belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes.

 The incident comes in the wake of Bengal cadre IAS officer L.V. Saptharishi alleging caste bias among election commissioners and the chairperson of the Industrial Development Bank of India being arrested under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, on charges of making casteist comments about a colleague.

 Radhanath Biswas, the secretary of the managing committee of the Dignagar Girls High School, about 80 km from Calcutta, and the former sabhadipati of Nadia zilla parishad, said the panel had unanimously decided to suspend headmistress Kuheli Pramanik as she did not respond to the showcause notice.

 The allegations against the headmistress are grave. We have received complaints that she humiliated SC and ST students through remarks that smack of a caste bias. Some students broke down in front of me. So, I slapped a showcause notice on her, said Biswas.

 The district inspector of secondary schools, Mahadeb Soren, said the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education had been informed about the suspension. The managing committee of the school comes under the board. So, we have informed it, he said.

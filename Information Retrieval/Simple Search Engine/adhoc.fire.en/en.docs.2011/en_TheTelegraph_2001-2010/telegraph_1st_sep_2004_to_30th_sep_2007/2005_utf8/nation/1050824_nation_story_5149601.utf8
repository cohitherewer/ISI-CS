 UAE lifts re-entry ban on expats

 Dubai (PTI): The UAE has revoked the 

 six-month ban on re-entry of expatriate workers who cancel 

 their work visas or leave jobs. 

 The decision, which is likely to have a major impact on the UAE labour market, came into force from Monday, a senior official said. We received a letter from the immigration and residency department with instructions from the interior minister not to stamp the ban on applications for cancelling visas. 

 Earlier, when expatriates were banned by the labour ministry, they got a stamp on their passports that barred them from entering the UAE during the ban period. 

 Millions of foreign workers, including 1.2 million Indians, are in the UAE.

 Chopra sees no link with dons

 Yash Chopra

Jalandhar, Nov. 19 (PTI): With money easily available, no underworld-film industry nexus exists in Bollywood at present, filmmaker Yash Chopra said here today.

 Ten years ago, such a relationship was not rare as producers were dependent on underworld dons for financing their ventures, he said.

 But now finances are easily available and the scenario has completely changed, Chopra, who was in town to attend an annual convocation of a girls college, added.

 New stars are very talented and committed to their profession. This has helped in knocking down the nexus between the underworld and the film industry. If you have talented stars and a good script, then finance is no hurdle.

 On extradited don Abu Salems reported links with Bollywood, Chopra said: I do not know anything about the episode. So, it is difficult to comment on such a sensitive issue.

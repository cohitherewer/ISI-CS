 Birth of overseas Indian citizen

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: India today kicked off its drive to grant dual citizenship to those of Indian origin who ? or whose ancestors ? had emigrated after the country was declared a republic on January 26, 1950.

 Eligible persons with citizenship other than Indian ? except those who have been Pakistani or Bangladeshi citizens at any point of time ? can apply for the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI).

 The home ministrys foreigner division started processing applications from today, said the additional secretary in the ministry, P.V. Bhide.

 The first OCI certificate will be symbolically handed over by the Prime Minister at the formal launching of the scheme at Pravasi Bhartiya Divas on January 7 at Hyderabad. Normally, it will take about a months time for an applicant to get the OCI, Bhide said.

 The ministry expects a huge response ? in lakhs ? from Indians living in those 71 countries whose current laws allow dual citizenship. The fee for an OCI certificate is $250 or an equivalent amount in other currencies.

 The fee has been kept low so that people do not hesitate at all. The idea is to encourage their long-term investments in business, real estate and other things, an official said.

 OCI holders will have a multipurpose, multiple-entry and lifelong visa to visit India. They, unlike mere Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs), will not have to register themselves with the foreigners regional registration officer even if their stay exceeds six months.

 They will also get all the economic, financial and educational facilities that Indian citizens enjoy. Such equal treatment, however, will not extend to the matter of acquiring agricultural and plantation properties, or getting government jobs, said D.S. Mishra, joint secretary (foreign). They wont have the right to vote or get elected to constitutional offices.

 Every case will be inquired into by the security agencies so that an OCI certificate acquired on the basis of concealed information or misrepresentation can be cancelled. Such persons will be blacklisted for entry into India, Mishra said.

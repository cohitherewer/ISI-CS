 Poachers turn protectors

 The Eastern Manas Wildlife Sanctuary

 Siliguri, March 9: Dreaded poachers to dedicated conservationists and hospitable hosts. The Bodos in Eastern Manas Wildlife Sanctuary have turned over a new leaf.

 And they are ready create a history of sorts with a first-of-its-kind community-based eco-tourism project in the Northeast.

 In sharp contrast to their identities ? as fierce militants or brutal poachers ? that they sported not many years ago, the Bodos have decided to take up eco-tourism, an initiative coordinated by the Siliguri-based Help Tourism and Ashoka Holidays.

 ?The Bodos decided to give up their violent ways after an agreement was signed for the creation of Bodoland on February 10, 2003,? said Raj Basu, director of Help Tourism and vice-president of the Association for Conservation and Tourism (ACT). He and Partha Das of Ashoka Holidays are two of the prime movers of the project, which is backed by Manas Tiger Reserve, Bodo Territorial Council, All Bodo Students? Union (Absu), Chapaguri Koklabari Anchalik Committee and ACT.

 Basu said: ?They (the Bodos) realised that they would have to conserve the forests and wildlife to survive. They chose tourism as an eco-friendly and sustainable way of livelihood and we are helping them market the project.?

 The Bodos have formed an eco-tourism committee, Mao-zigendri Eastern Manas Eco-tourism Society.

 Former poacher Budheshwar Bora?s tally ? 80 tuskers, two tigers and countless deer ? gives an idea of the organisation?s composition. About 150 poachers surrendered their gaziman (poaching guns) recently to take up forest conservation and tourism.

 ?In the last fortnight alone, they rescued three pythons that villagers had trapped. In other circumstances, they would have killed the snakes and sold the skins,? Basu said.

 ?We are training them on handling tourists. Regular workshops on identifying birds and flora and fauna are being organised,? he added.

 Das, general manager of Ashoka Holidays, said the reformed poachers? enthusiasm was overwhelming.

 ?Every night, they patrol the forests to ward off poachers. They have even constructed a 40-km road in the core area of the forest on their own, which was hitherto inaccessible. Pleased with the enthusiasm, the Wildlife Trust of India has offered to provide free petrol for two years for night-patrolling,? he said.

 A tour-package, Manas-100, has also been launched. The package includes jeep safaris, walks on forest trails, elephant rides, hornbill point excursion and Bengal Florican survey.

 Village activities include walking village trails, home weaving, country liquor-making and folk culture shows. A docu-film has been made and a London-based photographer has volunteered to do the promotion brochures. It will be the first time that tourists will be able to enter Eastern Manas, over 435 km east of here.

 Absu?s office has been converted into a dormitory for tourists.

 ?We hope to start homestay concepts in at least 10 homes by October. Each house will require about Rs 20,000 for renovation. We are helping the residents with soft loans,? Basu said.

 Truant Patil says sorry

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: Home minister Shivraj Patil today apologised after Speaker Somnath Chatterjee indicted him for being absent from the Lok Sabha, reports our special correspondent.

 Not finding either Patil or his junior ministers in the House when the time came for taking up a call attention notice from the BJP and Left parties, the Speaker adjourned proceedings for 10 minutes. 

 I tender my apologies, Patil told the House when it reassembled.

 I am taking a strong view of the home ministers absence, Chatterjee said, turning to the treasury benches where Sonia Gandhi was seated in the front row. As the Congress leaders squirmed in embarrassment, the Opposition shouted shame, shame, shame.

 Pak actor gets security at home

 Islamabad (PTI): The Pakistan government 

 has provided security to actor Meera even as a petition 

 was filed in a Pakistani court seeking to ban her from acting 

 in Indian films.

 Meera, who returned from the sets of Mahesh Bhatt?s film Nazar in Mumbai three days ago, was provided security after she took up the issue of threats with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and information minister Sheikh Rashid. She had received threats for allegedly featuring in a kissing scene in the film. 

 Meera lives in Lahore, home of Pakistan?s fledgling film industry, Lollywood.

 The petition was filed in Sindh High Court in Karachi stating that she had performed in ?immoral scenes? that did not match with Pakistan?s religious and social values. 

 The petition would be presented before a two-member bench, Pakistan TV Ary reported. The religious affairs ministry and the culture and tourism ministry were also party to the petition.

 Cops admit Anara goof-up

 Jammu: Jammu and Kashmir police admitted 

 before the high court on Friday that former Miss Jammu Anara 

 Gupta had been kept in illegal custody in October-November 

 last year, reports our correspondent.

 In an affidavit submitted to a division bench of Chief Justice S.N. Jha and Justice R.C. Gandhi, DGP Gopal Sharma said Anara was kept in illegal confinement for a few days starting October 24.

 The issue before the court is why Anara was picked up and at whose behest and how she was kept in custody. The judges today reserved judgment in the case.

 It is also to be determined why the crime branch and executive branch of the state police are fighting over the case. The crime branch has told the court that there is no case against Anara as the Andhra Pradesh Forensic Laboratory had identified that she was not the actor in the CD. But the executive police have sent the CD to other laboratories for further examination.

 The police have suspended five officers for detaining Anara after framing her of featuring in a pornographic CD. But they are dodging the question of paying her damages.

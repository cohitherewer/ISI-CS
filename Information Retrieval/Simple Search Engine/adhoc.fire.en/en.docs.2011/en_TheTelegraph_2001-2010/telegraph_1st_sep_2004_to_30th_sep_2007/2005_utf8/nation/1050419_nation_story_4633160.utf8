 College official in line of exam fire

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, April 18: The ?ghost? of Sarwat Ara, former head of the home science department at GBM College, Gaya, has come back to haunt the centre superintendent of MG College.

 Ghulam Samdani, the superintendent, faces charges of manipulating records to favour candidates during a practical examination in 2004 and getting the test conducted in the name of Ara, who had died eight years ago.

 Now, the Bihar Intermediate Education Council (BIEC) has issued a showcause notice to Samdani on why action should not be taken against him under the provisions of the Bihar Conduct of Examination Act. 

 The matter came to light a few months ago after it was found that according to the records, Ara was the external examiner for the home science practical test. 

 Suspecting fraud, council chairman Nageshwar Sharma set up a three-member inquiry committee comprising Sudama Singh, former head of the economics department at Magadh University, S.M. Humair Ahmed, head of economics at MG College and Bhikhari Yadav, philosophy teacher at Gaya College.

 In its 10-page report, the committee, on the basis of records and the statement of the principal of GBM College, confirmed that Ara could not have conducted the practical examination in 2004 as she had died eight years ago in 1996.

 On receiving the report, the BIEC authorities sought an explanation from the centre superintendent. Samdani, according to sources in the council, was contradictory in his explanation. While he initially said the examination was not conducted at his centre, he later claimed that that some college employee had forged his signature and used it on the documents that showed Ara as the examiner.

 Not satisfied with the explanation, council secretary Naga Ram issued a final showcause notice on April 13 to the superintendent. In his letter, the BIEC secretary has said the council will be left with no option but to take legal action under the said Act.

 The Act stipulates imprisonment as well as fine for those found guilty of unfair and criminal practices during examinations held in the state.

 Council chairman Sharma said he was committed to restoring the sanctity of the intermediate examinations in the state. ?The law will take its own course,? he added.

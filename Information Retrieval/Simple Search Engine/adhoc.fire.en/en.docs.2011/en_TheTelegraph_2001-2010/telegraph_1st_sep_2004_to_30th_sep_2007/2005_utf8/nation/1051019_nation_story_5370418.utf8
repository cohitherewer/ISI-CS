 PM missive on job plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: Manmohan Singh today asked all chief ministers to ensure that wages are paid within 15 days of demand for work under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, making it clear that the Centre means business and would consider a penalty if the act is violated.

 If the time frame is not adhered to, the state governments would have to pay the employment wages themselves.

 According to the act, the Centre will underwrite 90 per cent of the cost of providing employment while the states will pick up 10 per cent. 

 In a letter, the Prime Minister said the Centre, on its part, will ensure timely resource support to the programme but the states cannot escape their responsibility. 

 The implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act envisages a collaborative partnership of the central and state governments and of the panchayati raj institutions, Singh wrote in his missive.

 The Prime Minister said the importance of the initial phase of the rural job scheme in 200 districts was to yield useful insights and lessons in extending it across the country. The pilot areas would provide a ground for us to put in our best efforts and our collective will to make this act an effective instrument in ensuring livelihood security in rural areas, Singh said. 

 Therefore, the quality of implementation... in its initial phase is crucial in all respects and the role of state governments critical.

 STAR rustles up pizzas for KBC Friday

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai/Calcutta, Aug. 4: A new Amitabh Bachchan will enter your drawing room and if youre worrying about catching transport to get home before the 9 clock show, might even give you a free ride. And if the wife is getting stressed out over finishing in the kitchen by 9, the dinner could be arriving at your doorstep.

 As the old Bachchan, the benevolent patriarch in bandhgalas, makes way for the new and cool Bachchan in leather jackets, who will rap in Hinglish, in Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC)s second avatar, STAR Plus has lined up a series of on-ground marketing activities across the country.

 More than 50,000 pizza meals are being sent to homes nationwide so that time is not wasted in preparing dinner on the big Friday, according to the channel. 

 Local transport ? buses, autorickshaws and phatphatis ? is being organised in some big cities so that people can get back from work in time to catch Bachchan kickstart KBC2. 

 KBC is two to three times more popular than an India-Pakistan ODI, Ajay Vidyasagar, senior vice-president, marketing and communications of STAR India, told The Telegraph. 

 Our research has shown that it is enjoyed more when viewed in large groups. So the ethos behind all these marketing ideas is that the whole family should watch the show together. We have also tied up with multiplexes in Mumbai and Delhi to beam the launch episode on the big screens.

 While some lucky Calcutta homes will be served pizzas 15 minutes before the show, there will be six private buses in different parts of the city ready to zip you right in front of your TV set.

 But those expecting the good ol Bachchan and his computerji are in for a shock as the KBC2 format has been designed to cater to the new Indian audience. Thats because a lot has happened between the last episode of KBC, telecast in January 2002, and now, feels STAR.

 Not only have the times changed, the television audience has become cool, too, says STAR chief operating officer Sameer Nair. 

 When we started, Bachchan was a down-and-out actor, but today he is the biggest star. Also, some of the new audience has not seen the old KBC, not to mention the Amitabh of Deewar. For them, he is the star of Sarkar and Bunty Aur Babli.

 So the radically different Bachchan, looking cool in his printed shirts and aviator collars, discusses telephony and bluetooth with the contestants and even teases an 18-year-old from IIT Chennai on bodybuilding in the very first episode. 

 And no more welled eyes at lost opportunities? Bachchan the quizmaster will now lock the wrong answer without giving a clue or batting an eyelid.

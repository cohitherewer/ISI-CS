 Strike threat for right to strike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: The CPM-backed Coordination Committee for State Government Employees and Associations, which helps the party during elections, today said it would mount a campaign in defence of the right to strike. 

 Employees have the right to strike and government rules regarding terms and conditions of employment need to be amended, said Sukomal Sen, the general secretary of the All India State Government Employees Federation, the apex body of coordination committees of all states. 

 If necessary, we will take up a major campaign for the right. Were not ruling out a strike either, he added.

 Sens comment came on a day before a meeting between the Bengal government and trade unions in which the issue of making IT a strike-free domain is likely to figure.

 When chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee meets 28 representatives from 14 central trade unions at Writers Buildings, senior labour department officials will be present to explain the governments stand on strikes, especially in IT, which has already angered Citu, the CPMs labour arm. The party and its trade union wing are locked in a debate over the effectiveness of strikes as a form of protest. A debate is also raging within the CPM.

 With 2.5 lakh members in Bengal, the coordination committee is the largest body of government employees.

 Sen said the chief ministers logic was unacceptable. It is wrong to speak out against strikes. We dont accept such reasoning. Workers must fight for their rights when they are exploited, he said.

 Going a step further, the union leader argued that striking workers also had the right to put up pickets. 

 During the Citu-sponsored bandh on September 29, the chief minister was livid at the sight of supporters forcing people off the road and had asked party workers to exercise restraint. 

 Please dont block the road and dont stop people forcibly. Allow those who want to work to go to their offices, Bhattacharjee had told a group on Park Street that morning.

 After the infotech sector took a hit, the chief minister took up the issue with the party brass. 

 Sen today showed scant respect for what Bhattacharjee wants. Pickets have to be installed. People have to be discouraged from going out to make the strike a success, he said.

 But what about the peoples right to free movement?

 A little inconvenience cant be helped. After all, were fighting for the common people. Look at our issues ? right to work, opposition to FDI (foreign direct investment) and the new pension scheme, added Sen. 

 The union leader denied reports that ambulances were stopped by the strike brigade and patients made to get down.

 The coordination committee will again bring Calcuttas traffic to a halt during a rally on Wednesday.

 Sen rejected the Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority Bill, regarding which Bhattacharjee has been able to turn around a large section of his party. Citu is opposed to the bill that proposes management of the pension funds by a private agency.

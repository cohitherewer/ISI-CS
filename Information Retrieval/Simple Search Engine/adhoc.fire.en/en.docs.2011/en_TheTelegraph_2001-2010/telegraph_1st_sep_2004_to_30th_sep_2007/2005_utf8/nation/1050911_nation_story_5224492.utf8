 Bengal piece in 26/7 puzzle

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The skies over Bengal may explain why Mumbai got deluged in July. 

 Scientists plan to use aircraft, radars and satellites to study Bengals norwesters ? or kaalbaisakhis ? to grasp the science of storms in the subcontinent. And perhaps make sense of why Mumbai received 94 cm of rain in a matter of hours.

 Under a department of science and technology (DST) initiative, experts have drawn up a three-year project to study norwesters, the short-lived but violent pre-monsoon thunderstorms that strike Bengal and other eastern states every year.

 The project, called Storm ? acronym for severe thunderstorm observation and regional modelling ? will watch these thunderstorms and the associated cloud build-up from closer than ever before in India, project planners said.

 Weather scientists can now predict thunderstorms, but they want to improve the accuracy of the forecasts and learn finer details of thunderstorm behaviour.

 We want to forecast wind speeds and tell how much rainfall a storm will deliver, said Someshwar Das, a cloud physicist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Delhi.

 While Storm was conceived long before Julys freak Mumbai rain, scientists hope that insights from the project will lead to a better understanding of what happened on 26/7. 

 There is nothing in our current understanding of cloud physics that can explain the unprecedented 94 cm rainfall that Mumbai received in a few hours, said Madhavan Rajeevan, director of the National Climate Centre in Pune.

 At a meeting attended by science and technology minister Kapil Sibal early last month, scientists had groped for explanations, finally coming up with one involving a phenomenon called vortex ? an answer dismissed as guesswork by other experts.

 Researchers now hope to use a dense network of ground stations, mobile weather radars and satellites to observe the thunderstorms and the clouds that cause them.

 A Storm plan under review with the DST also calls for aircraft to drop instrument-laden balloons directly into the core of the storm. As the balloons fall through the clouds, they will send information about the clouds, moisture and wind to ground stations.

 Scientists who wrote the plan said how often and how thoroughly the observations will be made will depend on how much money the government is willing to spend.

 The Storm project, expected to begin in 2007, will be the first systematic study of thunderstorms in India since the 1940s. 

 Scientists said they picked norwesters because of their severity and because several occur every year. 

 At least four to five storms strike eastern India in April and May, Das said.

 Data from the observations will be used to model the physics of thunderstorms and incorporate it into weather prediction models. This would help improve short range (1-3 days) forecasts and medium range (3-7 days) forecasts, said Ashwini Bohra, director of the medium-range weather forecasting centre.

 Later, scientists may begin to study similar phenomena on the west coast.

 There has been very little work focused on the microphysics of clouds, which is complex but important, Rajeevan said. Cloud microphysics deals with the finer details of how rain is generated inside clouds.

 While Indian weather scientists have conducted intense campaigns to study the monsoon over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea in recent years, this is the first focused study of thunderstorms over land.

 Credit card dues harassment suit

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 issued notices to Standard Chartered Bank and Delhi police 

 on a JNU teachers petition accusing the bank of harassing 

 him for payment of credit card dues of his deceased brother.

 Justice H.R. Malhotra directed StanChart and the police to respond to the petition filed by Yogesh Sharma, an associate professor at the Centre for Historical Research, JNU, within eight weeks.

 The court also asked them to file a status report before July 25, the next date of hearing.

 Sharma alleged that the bank deliberately blocked payment by his brother Rakesh, who had lost his mental balance. He went missing and was found dead in Mumbai on October 18, 2004.

 The teacher also accused the police of not taking any swift action when Rakesh went missing.

 In his petition filed through counsel N.K. Jha, Sharma pointed out that according to the banks statement, in September 2004 ? when the cardholder was alive ? the outstanding was only Rs 7,966. But immediately after Rakeshs death, the bank inflated the bill to Rs 95,390, he alleged. Sharma claimed that StanChart illegally transferred the bank balance towards credit card outstanding after Rakeshs death.

 Accusing the bank of using criminals to intimidate him, he said even his elderly parents were not spared.

 Team to fight child labour

 Mumbai (PTI): The Maharashtra government 

 has formed a team of officers from various departments to 

 tackle the menace of child labour in Mumbai. 

 The decision comes following the rescue of 465 children from different zari units.

 The team comprises nodal officers from labour and women and child development departments, railways, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Mumbai police and representatives of NGOs.

 The team would be entrusted with the responsibility of detecting child labourers, rescuing, rehabilitating and repatriating them to their home states, sources said. The labour commissioner, who will be coordinating the team, has convened a meeting of the nodal officers of all the departments concerned. 

 The sources said the decision to form a separate team was taken due to shortage of staff for raiding the units and lack of authority to arrest the owner of the unit where child labourers are found.

 The sources said an estimated 35,000 child labourers exist in the city, working in various small-scale units, including zari, leather, jewellery and hotel industry. 

 Hotel closure timing 

 Mumbai: (PTI): The Maharashtra government 

 has been considering a proposal to extend closure timing 

 of hotels and restaurants in police commissionerate areas 

 till after 1 am.

 Members of the Hotel and Restaurant Association (western India) have sought extension till 1.30 am as in the case of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane. It was favoured as most movie halls close after midnight and in many cities, trains, buses and flights also arrive around that time. The extension would also help tourists who otherwise patronise roadside hawkers, they said.

 Fraud woman

 Moga (PTI): Police are on the hunt 

 for a woman who assured a farmers son a passage to 

 Britain but instead landed him in a prison cell in Moscow. 

 Balwinder Bawa of Ludhiana has been accused of cheating 

 him of Rs 7 lakh. 

 Bhimsen wife

 Pune (PTI): Vatsala Joshi, the wife 

 of classical singer Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, died here on Saturday 

 after prolonged illness. She was 78.

 Teacher sack

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court 

 has upheld the sacking of a schoolteacher accused of outraging 

 the modesty of a student. Jwala Singh of Jawahar Navodaya 

 Vidyalaya in Jammu and Kashmirs Rajouri district had 

 allegedly made sexual advances towards the girl while escorting 

 13 students to Punjab in 2000. 

 Seven killed

 Nashik (PTI): Seven persons, including 

 two children and a woman, were killed when a bus collided 

 with a stationary truck on Pimpalgaon highway, near here 

 early on Sunday. The Mumbai-bound bus was coming from Amravari. 

 Twenty-five people were injured in the mishap. 

 Phones in jail

 A Sunday afternoon welcome shower brought a sigh of relief for Delhi amid sweltering conditions. The 3.44-mm rain resulted from an upper air cyclonic circulation over surrounding areas.

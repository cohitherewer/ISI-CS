 Fraud slur on Husain buyer

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, April 22: Maqbool Fida Husain was not around when the most ambitious project for auctioning a series of his paintings was launched today.

 The reasons for his absence were not cited, but the ceremony came on a day a newspaper report levelled allegations of corruption against Guru Swarup Srivasatava, who made history by cutting a much-publicised deal with the painter to buy 100 Husain works for Rs 100 crore.

 The report said complaints had been lodged with police against Srivasatava, owner of the Swarup Group, for forgery by HDFC Bank and two chartered accountants.

 The accountants have accused Srivasatava of forging their signatures on balance sheets to obtain a Rs 60-lakh loan from HDFC to buy a flat.

 Srivasatava, who kicked off the process of auction in the presence of actor Fardeen Khan, was tightlipped about the allegations. 

 ?The law will take its own course,? he said. 

 The first complaint was registered in January and another in March. HDFC also filed a complaint in March and sent a reminder in April.

 Speaking at the news conference, Srivasatava shrugged off the charges, saying he would not like to speak on anything except ?art?.

 A spokesperson for the group added that the company did not have the full text of the complaints and the matter was ?being investigated?. He added that the charges were not correct and ?that would be proved in the court of law?. 

 The case has been transferred to the economic offences wing, which recorded the statement of P.S. Shetty, one of the accountants, today.

 ?We will call Srivasatava for questioning,? Meera Borwankar, the joint commissioner of police (crime), said.

 There seems to be an anomaly about the Husain deal, too. Srivasatava has repeatedly said Husain and he had entered into an ?MoU?. Today, he said it was only a ?mutual understanding?. 

 In September last year, Srivasatava had announced the deal with Husain. The 100-strong series, Our Planet Called Earth, that takes a sweeping view of the planet?s history in the last 100 years, including major political developments and issues like environment and peace, is to be completed on September 17, Husain?s birthday.

 In May, the auction of the paintings, which are slated to travel all over the world, will start. The brand ambassador of the set will be Fardeen, whose presence at the conference could hardly make up for Husain?s absence.

 Srivasatava said 25 of the 100 paintings were ready. The self-proclaimed patron of art for charity ? he said the Husain deal was engineered to earn for Indian art a place in the global market and that he was promoting needy young painters with his other schemes ? has also tried to use the Husain paintings for other ventures.

 One of the paintings has been acquired by mobile service operator Airtel to be used as a wallpaper on phones. Srivasatava was the sponsor of a major film award ceremony this year, where the paintings were used prominently.

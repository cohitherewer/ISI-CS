 Orissa to ride BPO wave

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 6: The Orissa government has initiated steps to create a vast pool of trained workers for BPO companies.

 With the BPO sector on the upswing, the state-owned Orissa Computer Application Centre (Ocac) has roped in two leading consultants to prepare the pool of workers for low-end jobs. Orissa currently has a dearth of graduates with expertise in information technology and proficiency in English.

 State IT minister Suryo Narayan Patro said the government will soon launch a training programme in collaboration with Bangalore-based companies MAFOI and NEXT. The state has also tied up with MERIT TRAC for conducting skill assessment tests to facilitate recruitment by BPO companies interested to set up units in the state.

 ?We will provide infrastructure support for the training programme. Recruitment tests will be conducted next week in major towns across the state by the BPO companies,? said Ocac chief executive and director of information technology Vishal Dev. 

 Initially, 50 students each will be trained by Ocac and Orissa State Electronic Development Centre at the proposed centres in Bhubaneswar.

 While companies like Progeon, ICICI OneSource, EXL Service and Hewlett Packard have expressed their desire to recruit successful candidates, teams from Dell and HSBC will visit the capital to explore the possibility of opening centres here.

 In its bid to grab a share of the BPO pie, the government has set up special complexes at Fortune Tower, Ocac Tower and Tower-2000 dedicated to IT companies. Fortune Tower, the biggest of them all, has an area of 3.53 lakh sq ft and eight floors. It has also attracted IT majors like Infosys, Satyam, TCS and Wipro to the state. 

 The government has targeted a 40 per cent rise in IT exports in the current fiscal. While IT exports of the state was worth Rs 319 crore in the last financial year, it had an export figure of Rs 254 crore in the first seven months of this fiscal. The government aims to reach the Rs 1,000-crore mark by 2007. ?Our target is to open employment avenues for more than 50,000 graduates every year,? Patro said.

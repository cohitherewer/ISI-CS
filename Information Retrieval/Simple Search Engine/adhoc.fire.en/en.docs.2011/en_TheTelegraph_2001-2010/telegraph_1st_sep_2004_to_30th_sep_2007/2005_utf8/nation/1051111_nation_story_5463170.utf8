 Friday court date for Gawli

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 10: The likely arrest of don-turned-MLA Arun Gawli, facing an extortion charge, has been delayed till tomorrow, when a sessions court will hear his anticipatory bail plea.

 Judge Abhay Thipsay today directed Gawlis lawyers to ask him to be present tomorrow after a categorical assurance by the prosecution that the MLA would not be arrested before the hearing.

 Gawli and six of his associates have been accused of extorting Rs 20 lakh from the owner of a hotel in central Mumbai to settle a property dispute.

 The hotel owner, Shakeel Ahmed, had lodged a case naming the MLA and the rest, including local corporator Sunil Ghate, at Agripada police station on Tuesday.

 Police then raided Gawlis den at Dagdi Chawl in Byculla in central Mumbai, but failed to trace him. 

 A crackdown yesterday on his other hideouts also came a cropper. 

 During the hearing this morning, the prosecution demanded that Gawli be present in court.

 Ahmed has approached the police again, alleging that he received threats on the phone from Gawlis henchman.

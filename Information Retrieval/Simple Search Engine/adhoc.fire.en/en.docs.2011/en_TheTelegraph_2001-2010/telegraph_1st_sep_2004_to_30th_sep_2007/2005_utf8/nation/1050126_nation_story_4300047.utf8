 Tribals to get forest land 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Jan. 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has cleared a bill that will grant tribals ownership rights over land in forest villages they have been cultivating for decades. 

 The scheduled tribes and forest dwellers (recognition of forest rights) bill will be introduced in the budget session of Parliament.

 A PMO press release said the bill will recognise the rights of tribal communities living in forest areas over land they had been tending to before enactment of the Forest Conservation Act of 1980. It had only legislated their right over land maintained in official documents and gazettes. The new bill will do so for land left unsettled in government records.

 The bill will essentially benefit those tribals who were cultivating land in forest villages over several generations but without ownership rights. Thus, the proposed legislation seeks to engage the tribal communities in tasks beyond cultivation like the regeneration of degraded forest land and increasing the forest cover. 

 The bill fulfills a commitment in the UPA?s common minimum programme to ?immediately review the overall strategy and programmes for the development of tribal areas to plug loopholes and to work out livelihood strategies?. 

 The bill evoked mixed reaction in Jharkhand, a state with a large proportion of tribals and headed for polls. Politicians cutting across party lines rushed to hail the announcement and claim credit for getting a similar resolution adopted unanimously in the Assembly last year. 

 ?The Prime Minister has accepted what we had proposed,? said chief minister Arjun Munda though several BJP leaders complained that the timing of the announcement violated the model code of conduct and was designed to give the Congress an unfair advantage in the election. 

 The state?s chief conservator of forests, J.L. Srivastava, however, threw a spanner by pointing out that the government cannot bring in any such legislation without the Supreme Court?s consent. 

 ?Neither forest land nor sea shores can be leased out to private parties nor can they be used for commercial purposes,? he said. 

 But tribal leaders hailed the plan to convert forest villages into revenue villages. Under the existing rules, they pointed out, there are stringent restrictions on all activities not related to forestry. 

 Development or even welfare projects like construction of roads, houses and drains could not be initiated. The new bill, they hoped, would free several hundred thousand forest dwellers from oppression.

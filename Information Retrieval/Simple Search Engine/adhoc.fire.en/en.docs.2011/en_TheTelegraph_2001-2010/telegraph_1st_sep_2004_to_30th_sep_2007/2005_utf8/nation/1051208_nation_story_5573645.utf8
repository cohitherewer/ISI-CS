 Nilotpal: Seeking control

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is not happy with his partys interference in higher education in the state. But his party colleagues in Parliament want to control higher educational institutions, particularly foreign universities.

 CPM MP Nilotpal Basu said at a news conference today his party was against allowing foreign universities ?even the best of them ? to set up branches in India.

 We are against the principle because foreign universities do not know the social and cultural milieu of India, he said.

 To most people, his argument sounded like the BJPs, which, along with the RSS, is scathing in its criticism of the influence of Western culture on Indian society. But the MP said: Our argument is totally different from the BJPs.

 We have no objection to foreign universities collaborating with Indian universities on projects. But we are against them coming here. We wont have any control over them, he explained.

 The entry of foreign universities is part of an ongoing debate on General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats). The Centre has to decide whether it is willing to open up the education and health sectors.

 Although the government has been weighing the pros and cons, the Left parties say they are against the entry of foreign institutions in both education and health.

 Human resource development minister Arjun Singh had floated a proposal for FDI in primary education soon after taking charge. But it was trashed by the Left and he had no option but to jettison it.

 The Centre wants to open up the higher education sector with adequate safeguards. It is drafting a bill on foreign universities in order to put in place a system of checks and balances.

 Experts working on Gats and education say India should lay down clear terms of give-and-take instead of stalling negotiations.

 TN village chiefs beat gender odds

 Gandhigram, Dec. 11: Kala Murugan was chief of the Nuthullapuram panchayat all right, but she was a woman and a Dalit as well. And the men in her village would not let her forget that.

 So when she approached the local branch of a nationalised bank in her village, 10 km from Nilakottai in Tamil Nadus Dindigul district, the manager shut the door in her face.

 The womens self-help groups she had mobilised with much trouble in her village were in dire need of funds. But the manager refused to even let them open an account, let alone give them a paisa.

 It is all caste prejudice and politics, what else is it? Kala fumed.

 But she was not to be deterred. In October, she moved the Tamil Nadu Asi Dravidar Housing and Development Corporation for loan so that 20 Dalit families could buy milch cows. Today, most of the villagers have taken up dairy activities and nearly 25 womens self-help groups are up on their feet and earning.

 Not just that, Kala has also managed funds to build more schools, a cement road and eight grain banks for her panchayat. Every time our local Dindigul MP came calling, we would go and pester him for funds. Thats how we managed to get the money, Kala beamed, proud that she had scaled adversity and gender bias and done her duty.

 The scene is similar in several state villages where women are panchayat chiefs. The men are unwilling to let go of their traditional bastions of power. Gender and caste bias are rampant. There is no end to malicious gossip on women who have opted for public roles.

 But the women are refusing to grovel or give in.

 Local gossip can hit women who come into public roles really hard, even to the point of paralysing them. But those days are behind us now, said K. Maruthambal Albert, panchayat chief of N. Panchapatti village, 5 km from Gandhigram in Dindigul district.

 Cosily ensconced in her chair at the panchayat office, Maruthambal dismissed suggestions that husbands were still running panchayats in absentia.

 Initially, there was gender shock and women panchayat chiefs would not even come to office. But then we took up an intensive awareness campaign with the help of Gandhigram Rural University to help women shed inhibitions and venture out, she said. Now I can happily say that 90 per cent women panchayat chiefs function independently and are ready to even fly to London.

 Maruthambal next launched into a programme for womens empowerment. It too had its share of hiccups but once those were ironed out, village women came out in droves. So much so that she managed to put together nearly 80 self-help womens groups in this small village of 6,460 people.

 In the last four years, Maruthambal has also promoted the concept of a clean village and taught people the health hazards of relieving themselves in public.

 We need 330 toilets for this village and we have so far built 250 toilets, said Vijayalakshmi, who heads the federation of self-help groups in Panchapatti. They are into various activities, including making pickles and candles and extracting perfume from jasmines.

 Rani Sathappan, panchayat chief of K. Rayavaram village, 15 km from Karaikudi, has done a shade better with cleaning up her village. Having built toilets in all houses in the village, Rayavaram has won the state governments Green Award this year.

 My husband and in-laws are supportive, which enables me to play my public role very effectively. This complements the training I got from Gandhigram Rural University on how to run a panchayat, she said.

 Rani has also motivated a womens self-help group to earn by renting out things required for weddings, such as utensils and furniture. She has persuaded villagers to clean up a large unused tank to stabilise irrigation in the village.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Naidu buffs new weapon

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, June 8: Namaskar, aap kaise hain. Aiye. Chai lenge?

 Uh-uh, said the man standing just behind. Say chai lijiye.

 And dont say Aiye. You should just say baithiye.

 Visitors to NTR Bhavan, the headquarters of the Telugu Desam Party, were in for a surprise on Monday. Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu greeted them in Hindi when they called on him in the afternoon.

 It was not so much the language of welcome that surprised them but the ease with which he seemed to have picked it up. 

 But why the sudden fondness for Hindi?

 Sources said Naidu, once the kingmaker in Delhi, is gearing up for a repeat performance as the key figure in a future third front alliance. 

 It is only a matter of time for Naidu to dissociate with the BJP, said party spokesperson Umareddy Venkateswarlu.

 Naidu, too, had indicated at the recent annual convention of his party that the Desam was not at the mercy of any political force, whether it is the BJP or the Left.

 We have already shown our growing popularity with the recent Penukonda bypoll. The party won the seat hands down with a majority of 18,853 votes, said senior leader Ashok Gajapathi Raju.

 Naidu, however, says his new-found interest in Hindi has nothing to do with his national aspirations. I handled national politics for a long time and spoke to many leaders from Hindi-speaking areas during the last 12 years. Both during the United Front and NDA regimes, I did not need any interpreters, he said.

 Ramamoorthy, his Hindi tutor, vouched for his pupils proficiency. Naidu liked the dialogues of Lagaan very much. He is also fond of the speeches of Sardar Patel and Lokmanya Tilak, the pundit said.

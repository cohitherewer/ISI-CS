 New Delhi, Oct. 19: One of the three Embraer jets, armed with missile deflecting systems, bought last month for VVIPs has been grounded after a technical snag.

 Minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal, who was to take the jet to Assam tomorrow, confirmed this and said he would now travel by the regular Indian Airlines flight.

 India had placed orders for five Embraers for Rs 730 crore, of which three have been inducted ? two by the Indian Air Force and one by the Border Security Force.

 The grounded jet, operated by the aviation unit of the BSF, was purchased exclusively for the movement of VVIPs in the home ministry.

 I dont know what exactly happened to the newly purchased jet but its engine is definitely making a strange noise. 

 We have sought technical help to correct the problem. It will take some days to make it airborne again, the minister said.

 French technicians are rushing to India with the required spare parts from Kansas to rectify the snag, a senior official said.

 The chief engineer, BSF air wing, K.S. Batra, said the Embraer has been grounded but refused to give details of the technical fault.

 However, sources said the snag was in the computer of its avionics which contains inputs from Israel and France besides India.

 The other two Embraer-135BJ Legacy jets inducted last month are being maintained and flown by the communication squadron of the air force and are meant for the exclusive use of VVIPs, including the Prime Minister, cabinet ministers and foreign dignitaries.

 The pilots for the jets, made in Brazil but retrofitted in the US with anti-missile shields, received training in France.

 The BSFs Embraer has so far been used by home minister Shivraj Patil twice for visiting Bangalore and Nagpur. 

 Home secretary V.K. Duggal and BSF director-general R.S. Mooshahary were to use it today for a visit to Srinagar. But after the snag was reported, they took one of the air force Embraers.

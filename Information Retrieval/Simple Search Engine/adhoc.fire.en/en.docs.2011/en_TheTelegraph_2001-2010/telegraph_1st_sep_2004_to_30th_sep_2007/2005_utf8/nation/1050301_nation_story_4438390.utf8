 Speaker amp; deputy quit on vote eve

Panaji, Feb. 28: The Goa Assembly Speaker and his deputy resigned from their posts today and the deputy chief minister was disqualified, giving a new twist to the power struggle after the BJP-led government was dismissed and the Congress came to power. 

 The move came before a vote of confidence could be taken up in the Assembly by the Pratapsinh Rane-led government. Instead, the House was adjourned sine die. 

 The vote of confidence was scheduled at 2.30 this afternoon. However, hours before the crucial Congress-BJP test of strength in the Assembly, Speaker Vishwas Satarkar disqualified deputy chief minister Filip Neri Rodrigues, who had switched sides to join the Congress, bringing a new turn to the power play.

 The ball now seems to be in the court of governor S.C. Jamir, who is a former Congress chief minister from the Northeast.

 In the 40-seat Goa Assembly, the Congress has 18 MLAs backing it, while the BJP has 17. 

 Blocking the BJP-affiliated Speaker?s vote would have reduced the numbers on the party?s side as he can cast his ballot only if there is a tie.

 Since February 2, when the governor dismissed the Manohar Parrikar-led government, the BJP has been facing one blow after another with several legislators switching over to the Congress. 

 The latest setback came four days ago when former deputy chief minister Digambar Kamat quit the BJP with plans to cross over to the Congress.

 Five MLAs have also resigned in a clear attempt to dodge the provisions of the anti-defection law.

 Since the May 2004 defeat of the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, its government in Goa has been under pressure. The Congress-appointed governor also added to its discomfiture.

 But the Parrikar administration clung on to power despite all attempts to dislodge it and even after being reduced to a minority. 

 Parrikar had told reporters yesterday that he would stake claim to form the next government ?after Rane loses his trial of strength?.

 Govinda crash

 Mumbai, Aug. 16: The wife and children of actor and MP Govinda, who were injured in a road accident yesterday, are recovering, reports our special correspondent.

 They are in the ICU but responding well to treatment, said Kirti Kumar, Govindas film-director brother.

 Govindas family, accompanied by his secretary Rishabh, were on their way to Ajmer Sharif yesterday morning when their Qualis was hit by a truck near Jaipur. Govindas wife and two children survived, but Rishabh died. Driver Abdul, admitted to a Jaipur hospital, is still critical.

 Govindas wife Sunita, 36, son Yash, 10, and daughter Narmada, 15, were brought to Leelavati Hospital last night here. Kumar said while Yash and Sunita were likely to be discharged soon, Narmada would be in the ICU for a few days.

 Naveen: Fiscal trip

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 13: Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik will visit New Delhi tomorrow to finalise the Rs 2,500-crore plan outlay approved by the Planning Commission for the 2005-06 fiscal.

 Earlier, the government had prepared a plan outlay of Rs 3,250 crore, anticipating a World Bank loan of Rs 950 crore. The plan panel, which insisted that Orissa prepare a ?realistic? budget on the basis of its own resources, later revised the annual plan outlay to Rs 2364.57 crore. 

 Planning Commission officials argued that since the World Bank and the UK government?s Department for International Development did not keep their earlier promise of providing support to the state, the budget should be ?realistic?.

 Discussions with the government followed and the panel decided to enhance the outlay to Rs 2,500 crore. Although the World Bank has sanctioned Rs 625 crore as part of the structural adjustment loan, the commission has not taken the same into account while approving the revised estimate.

 Finance department officials said the Planning Commission has approved Rs 383.27 crore for the undivided Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region under special area programmes, Rs 358 crore for irrigation and flood control, Rs 502 crore for energy, Rs 657.64 crore for social services, Rs 145.22 crore for general services, including cyclone reconstruction and disaster management, Rs 167. 97 crore for transport and Rs 124.52 crore for rural development.

 State finance minister Prafulla Ghadei has said there is only a marginal shortfall in the state?s own revenue target. The state?s own tax and non-tax revenue in 2003-04 were Rs 3,168 crore and Rs 1,095 crore respectively.

 Ghadei said fiscal reforms initiated four years ago have started to yield results. The government has managed to cut revenue deficit from Rs 2,574 crore in 1999 to Rs 1,420 crore in 2003-04 and has even received an incentive grant of over Rs 263 crore from the Centre.

 The revenue generation and expenditure figures showed that the government has succeeded in keeping revenue expenditure in line with revenue receipts. While expenditure grew by 13 per cent, receipts increased by 13.3 per cent. 

 Review of the state?s finances has thrown light on the fact that the government has achieved the targeted projections made in the memorandum of understanding it had signed with the Centre, he added.

 Ghadei said the government has initiated several steps for expenditure rationalisation. In tune with the decision to rightsize the administration, 24,144 posts have been abolished and a ban imposed on recruitment except in key social and regulatory sectors. 

 The government has also introduced voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for its employees and suspended LTC and surrender leave to reduce expenditure.

 Steps have also been initiated to streamline public sector undertaking (PSU)s in the state. About 27,760 employees of PSUs have been given VRS and VSS (voluntary separation scheme). The government has closed down 10 loss-making PSUs and identified 15 more for closure. Besides, it will disinvest its stake in 11 PSUs and restructure eight enterprises.

 Security prisoners in focus

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The furore over Sarabjit Singhs death sentence in Pakistan has brought into focus a matter that has been judiciously kept out of the public eye by India and its neighbour ? the issue of security prisoners.

 Although Sarabjits innocence is still to be proved ? he has been charged with involvement in bomb blasts in Pakistan as a RAW agent ? media attention has been drawn to this category of prisoners who are intelligence operatives captured in the enemy country and jailed for long periods, often without trial.

 At present, India and Pakistan are engaged in a dialogue on the early release of civilian prisoners on either side. These are generally fisherfolk or people living in areas near the borders who have inadvertently strayed to the other side. There are also some who have entered either country to meet relatives or friends and have not returned.

 Both India and Pakistan acknowledge that they have prisoners of war (PoWs) in their custody. But so far, neither side has admitted to the existence of security prisoners. The exact number is not known, but sources said many security prisoners are languishing in jails on either side.

 Officials said verification of prisoners and establishing their nationality are always difficult as their physical features and the languages they speak are often similar. 

 It is relatively easier to find out the nationality of PoWs as they have identity cards, other documents or badges to establish their military unit.

 South Block officials said the nationality of 430 Indian prisoners in Pakistani jails has been established. Pakistan has been able to establish the nationality of 80 civilian prisoners lodged in Indian jails.

 Babu leave blow to Bihar governor

 Patna (PTI): Governor Buta 

 Singh faced his biggest crisis since President?s rule was 

 imposed in Bihar with chief secretary G.S. Kang going on 

 an unspecified long leave on Friday and returning his official

 to have written to Singh stating that he is going on leave, 

 reports our special correspondent. However, sources in the 

 secretariat said he was unhappy with the governments 

 decision to transfer 17 IPS officers late on Thursday evening. 

 Kangs strained relations with Singh and his adviser, former chief secretary Arun Pathak, is also being cited as a possible reason. I have proceeded on leave. The details can be verified from the governors offices, said Kang.

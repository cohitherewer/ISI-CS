 Pune fraud rings alert, not alarm bells

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, April 20: The BPO fraud in Pune has shaken up India?s growing outsourcing industry but hardly merited attention in the US, where Citibank customers were the victim.

 This could be the main reason dire predictions like the one by Forrester Research, which conducts research on technology firms, that the Pune incident might slow the growth of India?s BPO industry by 30 per cent are unlikely to come true.

 ?The BPO fraud, which happened in Pune is an isolated incident and this will not affect the prospects of Indian BPO industry. However, Indian industry needs to be vigilant to prevent incidents like this,? Mckinsey amp; Co principal Jayant Sinha said in Mumbai today. 

 Frequent incidents of this kind would prompt foreign clients to ?rethink? about their offshoring destination strategy, Sinha warned.

 Sixteen people have been taken into custody after it was discovered that a group, led by a former employee of MsourcE, a BPO company, had persuaded some New York clients of Citibank to part with their Net banking password and transferred money out of their accounts to accounts in Pune. MsourcE handles customer relations management for Citibank.

 While the scale of the fraud ? some $425,000 was taken out ? has knocked the BPO industry cold, the majority opinion seems to be that the prompt ?debugging? operation by police in Pune has controlled the damage.

 They cautioned, however, that die-hard opponents of outsourcing could still seize on the crime to fan the flames of a backlash. There is little public display of that yet.

 News of the fraud did not make it to the bigger papers like the New York Times and The Washington Post. Newspapers in smaller cities, like the Minneapolis Star and Arkansas Gazette, used wire service reports in business pages.

 ID, or identification, theft is so common in the US, where the opposition to outsourcing is the strongest, that the Pune incident has escaped attention.

 At almost the same time as the Pune fraud unravelled, LexisNexis, a Dayton, Ohio, company, which is a leading provider of legal, news and business information, said that after an extensive review it had come across several incidents of ID theft. Some 30,000 affected individuals have already been notified and 280,000 more will be alerted.

 Gartner, the technology research company, has spoken of Indian outsourcing receiving ?unwelcome attention? because of the Pune rip-off.

 ?Gartner has long predicted that a major fraud case or intellectual property issue would focus unwelcome attention on the security of offshore outsourcing,? it said.

 Information technology-enabled services and business process outsourcing in India are expected to have clocked revenues of $5.7 billion in 2004-05. Industry representatives do not see much of an impact on revenue from the Pune fraud for three reasons.

 First, it will serve as a reminder to all companies to stay alert and recheck the internal controls.

 Second, big-ticket players could benefit as they draw more customers than second-tier companies.

 Third, customers will carry out tighter due diligence ahead of a new outsourcing contract.

 Wipro BPO and Progeon Ltd (Infosys?s arm) said the fraud would spur them to stay more alert.

 ?We will continue to invest in security procedures and that will restore the confidence in our customers. Even in this case, the police acted quickly as soon as the fraud was discovered. We have cyber laws in place to deal with such crimes but we must watch how the courts deal with the case,? a spokesperson for Wipro BPO said.

 Wipro chief Azim Premji recently said his company was hiring private detectives to verify the antecedents of employees. Although only professional claims of job aspirants are verified, such screening is eventually expected to become the industry norm.

 Akshay Bhargava, the chief executive officer of Progeon Ltd, said security mechanisms are audited ahead of every contract by customers.

 ?There?s no cause for panic because cyber crimes occur in other countries as well. But this case will prompt every company to recheck the internal controls mechanism,? Bhargava said.

 His colleague in Infosys Technologies, Basab Pradhan, the head of worldwide sales and marketing, saw a positive side in the quick action taken against the criminals. 

 ?In a way, it is good the incident has come to light. It means India has taken steps to track criminals in cyber space and we have brought those people to book,? he said.

 Gartner, too, does not believe the incident will ?seriously damage? the BPO industry. ?Frauds of this type can happen anywhere,? it said.

 ?The entire Indian offshore industry ecosystem must act quickly and decisively to counter the perception that Indian BPO poses a severe security risk,? Gartner added.

 Nasscom, the industry association, has stepped in. ?Over a period of time, we are contemplating training in values and ethics for employees and one for customers to make them sensitive to the issue of not sharing data,? said Kiran Karnik, its president.

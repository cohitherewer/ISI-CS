The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Factory threat to wonder caves

 BIDHAYAK DAS

 Shillong, July 3: The nations longest network of underground caves is in danger from a chain of cement factories the Meghalaya government has allowed to come up right above them.

 Chief minister D.D. Lapang got sucked into the controversy today with the Indian Bureau of Mines alleging that his announcement of an investigation was an eyewash.

 The jewel of the Lumshnong cave system in the Jaintia Hills is the Krem Kotsati, which measures 21.5 km and forms a 35-km-long underground maze with many others. Adventure enthusiasts love the challenge of finding a way out of the labyrinth.

 Environmentalists say the Kotsati will cease to exist if the cement factories, all of them quite new, are allowed to go ahead with production. The entrances of some 24 caves have already been blocked by deposits from the limestone quarries. The two newest plants ? Meghalaya Cements Ltd and Cements Manufacturing Company Ltd ? could pose the biggest threat.

 When a furore broke out, Lapang said his government would scrutinise all the documents on the cement plants, which were sanctioned after the Meghalaya Industrial Policy, 1997, introduced single-window clearance. 

 Yes, we must get at the truth and see that our environment and caves are not destroyed, he had said.

 To silence the NGOs, Lapang announced in the Assembly in March that the Indian Bureau of Mines had been asked to carry out an inquiry.

 Today, the bureaus director, C.R. Ambesh, said the institute did not have the mandate to conduct inquiries, and that its team had only done a study on blasting operations in limestone quarries close to the cave system. The IBM is a scientific organisation and not an investigative agency. Its role is limited to observations, which may or may not be used by an investigative agency.

 Bureau assistant controller of mines and officer-in-charge (northeastern region), Lal Hriatrenga Chhangte, too, said a probe and a scientific study were two different things.

 The questions that environmentalists, cave experts and the Meghalaya Adventure Association want answered are:

 How have two cement plants been allowed to 

come up right above the Krem Kotsati?

 What is the extent of damage to the caves from 

pollution, limestone debris and seepage from the cement factories?

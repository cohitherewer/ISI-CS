 Ex-cop to move court for FIR

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 24: Retired inspector-general of police Surendranath Swain, who created a furore last month by lodging a police complaint against Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik and a few bureaucrats in the Tangarpada mining case, has decided to approach the court for registration of his FIR.

 On January 24, Swain had lodged a complaint against Patnaik and several others alleging corruption in the controversial Tangarpada chromite mines deal. However, his 15-page FIR was not registered by Capital police station, Bhubaneswar, as the matter was sub judice.

 Talking to reporters in Cuttack yesterday, Swain said he would seek the intervention of the court of subdivisional judicial magistrate in Bhubaneswar for the registration of the FIR. He would also move Orissa High Court seeking a probe by the CBI as he did not think the state police were competent enough to look into the matter.

 Swain said the government?s efforts to favour the Jindals was in violation of the Prevention of Corruption Act and invited criminal charges. 

 Apart from Patnaik, Swain had named urban development minister K.V. Singhdeo, senior IAS officers S.P. Nanda and Hrusikesh Panda and the board of directors of Industrial Development Corporation Limited in his complaint.

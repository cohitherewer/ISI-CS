 Bengal torture link to attack

 Jehanabad, Nov. 14: The action itself was meant to speak loud enough to make the deaf hear. But the Maoist raiders also left behind six posters ? printed A-4 sheets ? at the jail so theres no mistaking the objectives of the attack, or its Bengal link.

 The provocation for the strike, the posters say, lies in the May 21, 2005, arrest of CPI (Maoist) leaders Sushil Roy alias Shome and Patit Pawan Halder alias Tapas near Calcutta and their torture by police.

 The immediate aims: to free comrades languishing in the prison and to inflict the death penalty on Ranbir Sena men using the jail, apparently, as a safehouse.

 Another obvious objective is left unsaid: to dispel the impression that the Naxalites are on the run in Bihar. The rebels had been forced to lie low, thanks to the heavy paramilitary deployment, when several strongholds voted in the first two phases of the Assembly polls. But the strike on the night of the third phase is clearly meant to send a message that the Maoists are strong enough to strike at will.

 The printing on the posters is as eloquent as the text. The captions Russi November Kranti (Russian November Revolution) and Operation Jailbreak are in bright red and the text in black, blue and green.

 The date is printed in black, with a blank left after November 1?, where the 3 has been filled in neatly with a black felt pen. Obviously, the plan was hatched well in advance but the exact date fixed later.

 The posters explain: It (the attack) is a result of the reactionary ruling classes, oppressive and corrupt police-jail-judicial system and peoples anger. Revolt is the justice for injustice. When humanity is being tarnished, armed revolution is the only answer.

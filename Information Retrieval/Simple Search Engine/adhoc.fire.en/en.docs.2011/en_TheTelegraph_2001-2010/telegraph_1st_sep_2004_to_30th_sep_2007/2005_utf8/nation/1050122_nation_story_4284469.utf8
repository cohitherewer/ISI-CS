 Sonia set to campaign

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: Sonia Gandhi?s campaign programme being planned by Congress strategists for the Assembly polls in three states is not good news for Laloo Prasad Yadav. 

 Locked in a battle to preserve his Muslim-Yadav vote bank against perceived incursions by Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, which has forged an upper-caste-Dalit understanding with the Congress, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief is hoping Sonia would bypass Bihar, in deference to the friendly contest they had decided on. 

 But there are indications that Sonia could address at least four public meetings in the state. Tentatively, the venues have been identified as Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur and Darbhanga. 

 It comes in the backdrop of reports that the railway minister had requested Sonia to avoid campaigning in the state to help him keep his voter base intact in the Congress-RJD ?friendly? contest. 

 Fielding the Congress? star campaigner in the complex Bihar poll battle is being considered necessary after reports presented a dismal picture about the state unit?s poll-preparedness. 

 ?The party organisational machinery is in a disarray. The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters in Patna is hardly in a functional state,? said a party poll manager. 

 After the dismal report by central observers, the high command feels that the party would have to field Sonia for ?extensive? campaigning to take advantage of what is perceived as a ?pro-Congress sentiment? even among traditional RJD voters. 

 Besides, the central leadership has decided to virtually take control of the Bihar poll management. Four secretaries have been rushed to Patna from Delhi to make an assessment of the requirements. 

 Party sources, however, ruled out the possibility of Sonia making joint appearances with either Paswan or Laloo Prasad.

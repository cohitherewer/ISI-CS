 Hindi drives Hollywood demand

 Mumbai, May 23: Spidermans lips may not agree with the Hindi he speaks, but dubbed films are driving the march of Hollywood in India.

 Yes Bank, in a report it has compiled in association with the Film and Television Producers Guild of India on the Indian film industry, says there has been a significant increase in the box office collections of foreign films (primarily Hollywood) over the past four years.

 Gross box office collections for foreign films in India have increased from Rs 1,350 million in 2001 to Rs 1,800 million in 2004, translating into a growth of 33 per cent. 

 The number of foreign films, however, has increased at a slower rate of 23 per cent since 2001. Gross box office collections per foreign film have increased from Rs 21 million in 2001 to Rs 23 million in 2004, says the report, put together by Sunir Kheterpal, country head, entertainment and media banking, Yes Bank.

 Dubbed films have fuelled the growth, the report says. Almost 35 to 40 per cent of total box office collections of foreign films was contributed by dubbed films in 2004 as compared to approximately 25 per cent in 2001, the report adds.

 Columbia Tristar was the leading foreign film distributor in India with gross billings of about Rs 1,000 million in 2004 and Warner Brothers came next with gross box office collections of Rs 400 million.

 The major grossers in Columbia Tristars kitty were Spider-man 1 and 2, Godzilla and XXX, all of which were released with dubbed versions in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.

 Out of the collections from dubbed versions, Hindi versions contributed close to 50 per cent while Tamil and Telugu constituted 30 and 20 per cent respectively.

 The increase in the number of multiplexes has also driven Hollywoods growth, the report says. A sizeable section of the multiplex audience watched Hollywood movies, says trade analyst Indu Mirani. That has also contributed to Hollywoods growth rate, which is quite good, she adds.

 If the figures are right, it is a good growth rate, agrees trade analyst Taran Adarsh.

 But the indigenous industry may take heart ? Hollywood is nowhere near the market for domestic films.

 Foreign films constitute 15 to 17 per cent of the gross box office collections of all Hindi films and 20 per cent of the top 50 Hindi films, says Kheterpal. The small share of foreign films in total gross box office collections in India makes the local Indian film market comparable to that of the local film market in the US.

 Hollywood dominates the rest of the world. In the UK, foreign films dominate more than 95 per cent of the market, in Australia it is 98.7 per cent, in Japan 62.5, Hong Kong 54 and in South Korea 39.7 per cent, the report adds.

 But the proportion of the gross box office collections of foreign films lies between 5 and 10 per cent of the total gross box office collections of all Indian films, Kheterpal says.

 In the US, too, foreign films constitute less than 5 per cent of the market.

 This makes India, along with the US, one of the strongest local film markets in the world, the report concludes.

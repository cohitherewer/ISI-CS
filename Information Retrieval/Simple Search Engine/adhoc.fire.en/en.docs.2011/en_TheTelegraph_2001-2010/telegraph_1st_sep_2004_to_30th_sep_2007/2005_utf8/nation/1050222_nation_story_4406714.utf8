 Dutt backs Tricolour on gear

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Feb. 21: Responding to a home ministry clarification last year, the Union sports minister has defended cricketers? use of the Tricolour on their dress and gear during a game.

 ?It happens everywhere in the world. It helps build up emotions and inspire the players. It does not show any disrespect to the nation,? Sunil Dutt said in Hyderabad today. 

 Dutt?s comments followed Sachin Tendulkar?s statement this morning that he did not find anything wrong in using the Tricolour on his helmet. 

 ?I am proud of being an Indian. Hence I wear it always on my forehead, on my helmet,? said Tendulkar. ?What is wrong? It helps to boost my morale when I am playing abroad,? said Tendulkar.

 Dutt said he had forwarded a letter from the Board of Control for Cricket in India to the home ministry some time ago. ?The home ministry replied that the display of the Tricolour by players in any form was a violation of the flag code,? he said. ?I am only a dakia (postman),? Dutt said, pressed for details. 

 A home ministry official said in Delhi that the players? display of the flag is an offence ?as the law stands today?. But it can be amended if the government feels that public opinion favours a change, he added. If the sports ministry seeks a review, the government can initiate steps for the amendment.

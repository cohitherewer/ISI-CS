 High-school-for-all on Centre table

 - After elementary, Delhi turns eyes to universal secondary education

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Centre is working on a blueprint for universalising secondary education to cope with the number of students who will finish their elementary education by 2011 if the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan succeeds.

 The Abhiyan, a programme for universalising elementary education, aims to have all children in the 6-14 age group in schools by 2011. This would throw up lakhs between 14 and 17 who the government says will have to be enrolled for secondary education.

 The number of children eligible for secondary education, according to the 2001 census, is 9.17 crore. This figure could rise to 9.82 crore by 2011.

 We hope to get our act on secondary education by the 11th Plan, said an official in the human resource development ministry.

 The ministry, with the help of the National Council of Educational Research and Training, is trying to revamp elementary and secondary education. It is drawing up a curriculum that will be student friendly, accelerating the pace of the Abhiyan, and working out a programme for universalising secondary education.

 The ministry and the NCERT are being assisted by the Central Advisory Board of Education (Cabe), a decision-making body on education.

 A Cabe panel has recommended a centrally-sponsored scheme for universalising secondary education. It has suggested that the Centre bear most of the financial burden for the programme, including expenditure for buildings and additional teachers.

 Educationists and experts, however, feel it is also the responsibility of state governments to think of ways to raise revenue for universalisation of secondary education.

 Universalisation of secondary education is a long journey. It cannot be achieved overnight, says the Centre. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has given a fillip to universalisation of elementary education. 

 However, the situation in secondary education remains grim, according to the government. There is overcrowding at the secondary level even when the dropout rate is as high as 52 per cent. Only 20 per cent of those who get through primary education make it to the secondary level, it said.

 The government and experts believe every person must complete 12 years of education as the world is getting increasingly competitive.

 The World Bank says an adolescent equipped with secondary education can earn 1.7 times more than someone with just primary education.

 Elementary education is no more adequate ? it neither equips a child with necessary knowledge and skills to face the world of work nor does it empower her to deal with the challenges of a globalising economy, said the Cabe report.

 What career avenues ? professional or otherwise ? are open to a child after merely eight years of elementary education? The eligibility condition of even low-level certificate or diploma courses require at least a Class XII certificate, it said.

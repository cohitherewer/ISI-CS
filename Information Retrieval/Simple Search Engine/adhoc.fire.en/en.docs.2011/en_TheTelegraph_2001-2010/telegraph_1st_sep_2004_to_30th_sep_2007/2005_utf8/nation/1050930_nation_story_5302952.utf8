 Prisoner swap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: The Union cabinet today gave its nod to the transfer of prisoners of foreign origin, convicted in India, to their home countries and to enable prisoners of Indian origin, serving their sentence abroad, to return home to serve the remaining part of their sentence.

 The decision will cover only Canada and Mauritius.

 The order, however, came with some riders. The transfer request will have to be agreed on by the transferring and receiving states, but the request can be made by a convicted prisoner or a person acting on his behalf if the prisoners age or physical/mental condition disallowed him from moving the request himself.

 The transfer will be possible only if the judgment pronouncing the sentence is final in India ? that is, if no appeal or revision is pending in any court. If the judgment is contested at any level, the prisoner cannot be transferred.

 The other caveats are:

 The law of the receiving 

 state will govern the enforcement of the sentence. But the 

 receiving state will be bound by the legal nature and the 

 quantum of the sentence pronounced in the transferring state

 Even if the convicted person 

 is a citizen of a country apart from the receiving state, 

 his transfer will not be affected

 The transferring state 

 alone will be competent to decide any review application 

 of the judgment. But either state can grant pardon, amnesty 

 or commutation in accordance with their Constitution and 

 other laws

 The cabinet laid down certain 

 conditions under which a transfer cannot take place. These 

 are:

 If the transferring state 

 is of the view that the act will be prejudicial to the sovereignty, 

 security or any other interest of the transferring state

 There are other cases pending 

 in the transferring state against the convicted prisoner

 He is convicted for an 

 offence under military law and not the routine criminal 

 law of the transferring state

 If the convicted person 

 is awarded death penalty.

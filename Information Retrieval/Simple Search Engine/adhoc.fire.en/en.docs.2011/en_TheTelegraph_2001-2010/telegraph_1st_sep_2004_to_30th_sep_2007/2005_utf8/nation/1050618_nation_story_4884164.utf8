The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Crore amp; more calls for KBC

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Bachchan: Top draw

 Calcutta, June 17: Its a feast for number-crunchers and a fitting return for the biggest game show on Indian television.

 In just 10 days from the time the lines were made open, the second edition of the Amitabh Bachchan-hosted Kaun Banega Crorepati has registered an incredible 1.5 crore calls. Compared to the total of nine crore calls in the 309 episodes of its first outing, KBC2 is all set to keep breaking more records through the remaining 85-episode run.

 Samir Nair, the chief operating officer of STAR India, said from his Mumbai office: Last time, the nine crore calls happened in a period of one-and-a-half years and its been 1.5 crore in just 10 days. That too before the show has come on television. We hope the numbers will multiply manifold once the show goes on air. 

 Interestingly, the metros have not been responsible for the maximum telephony damage which kickstarted on June 6 at 9 pm. While 23 per cent of the calls have come from the metros, the remaining 77 per cent have come from the small interior towns of the country. Its the aspirational thing, explains Nair. Our first series of promos with Mr Bachchan have tried to harp on the same ummeed (hope) factor.

 Unlike last time when aspirants could register just one entry each every time the phone lines were made open to the public, this time they have had the chance to punch in the right answer everyday for a new episode and that, too, as many times as they want. 

 Its like each night is a fresh draw when the lines open at 9 pm, laughs Nair. You may fail on a particular episode but can start afresh the very next day.

 STAR has also made most of the available technology using friendly interfaces for the callers and making lines accessible all the time. When we first started out five years back, we were handicapped when it came to technology and the lines would get jammed. But now thanks to improved mechanisms, we havent received any complaint so far, reveals Nair.

 The major chunk of the calls has come between 9 pm and midnight and also in the afternoons. 

 Of the lakhs of right entries for every episode, the computer has randomly picked names of 200 contestants, who would be called in and asked the stage two questions. Once through that, its a trip to Mumbai and a tryst with destiny at the Filmistan sets.

 To go on air from August 5, KBC2 boasts of a total prize money of Rs 2 crore which one can crack through the 15 questions Bachchan the quizmaster will pop one after the other. While the rules remain the same as last time, an extra lifeline should give the contestants more shots at the jackpot. 

 Also, in an effort to promote weekend television, STAR will beam the show on Saturdays and Sundays unlike Mondays to Fridays, as was the schedule in the first edition.

 Court scanner on Gaya cop

 Patna, Jan. 20 (PTI): Patna High Court today sought an explanation from the Gaya superintendent of police for not arresting absconding RJD candidate from the Belaganj Assembly constituency, Surendra Prasad Yadav, when he had turned up to file his nomination papers.

 The division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S.N. Hussain ordered SP Sanjay Singh to appear before the court on Monday to explain why he did not arrest Yadav, who had a non-bailable arrest warrant and property attachment order pending against him in three criminal cases.

 The bench observed that the court will request the Election Commission to order Singh?s transfer if he fails to come up with satisfactory answers. Today?s directive came on a complaint by BJP candidate from Belaganj Mukesh Kumar.

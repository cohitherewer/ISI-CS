 CBI raids courtrooms

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 2: Work at the Karkardooma court complex came to a standstill yesterday when the CBI began searching the courtrooms of three special metropolitan magistrates dealing with traffic challan matters.

 Chaos prevailed in the complex as the CBI personnel went about examining files. The CBI spokesperson was not available for comment, but sources said these were just preliminary searches. 

 No FIR had been filed and the searches were reportedly conducted on a complaint from the Karkardooma court, they added.

 The officer in charge of the court accompanied the agency personnel during the operation.

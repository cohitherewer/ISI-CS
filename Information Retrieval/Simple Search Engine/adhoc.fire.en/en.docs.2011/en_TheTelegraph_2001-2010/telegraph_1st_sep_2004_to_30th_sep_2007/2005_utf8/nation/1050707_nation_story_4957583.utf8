 Two-child bar plea for train tickets

 R.VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, July 6: Getting government jobs and railway reservations could become impossible for those with more than two children if a PIL pending before Delhi High Court is upheld. 

 The Centre, during the BJP-led NDA regime, had floated the idea that those with more than two children should be barred from contesting elections. But no bill could be introduced in Parliament nor could the 79th Amendment Bill to the Constitution be revived as almost all political parties were against it. 

 Today, a bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul issued notices to the Union home ministry and that of health and family welfare, the National Population Commission, the registrar-general and the census commissioner on the petition by Delhi lawyer Ravi Prakash Gupta.

 The lawyer argued that citizens who do not heed the two-child norm should not only be barred from contesting elections, they should also not get government jobs and benefits as well as rail and bus reservations. 

 If they (those with more than two children) keep on crowding this country, eating up its already shrinking resources, not adhering to the directive principle of the state policy of the two-child norm, then they should not be considered even for rail and bus reservations, Gupta said. 

 He pointed out that the Constitution was sought to be amended mandating the two-child norm through the 79th Amendment but the bill is pending before Parliament over 16 years as legislators from various states prevented it from being passed. 

 Standing counsel for the central government, Anjana Gossain, argued that as the norm comes under the directive principles of state policy, the petition should not be entertained till a law is in place. 

 It would tantamount to the judiciary determining policy matters of the state if the PIL is allowed, the counsel said. 

 Last year, the Supreme Court upheld a Haryana government law that barred anyone from contesting panchayat and other local body elections if they had more than two children. 

 A three-judge bench rejected hundreds of petitions by pradhans and up-pradhans. 

 The apex court also shot down an argument by Muslim panchayat members who said the law violated Article 25 of the Constitution that guarantees the right to freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion.

 The court said the two-child norm was neither arbitrary, nor unreasonable, nor discriminatory. It is not violative of Article 14 guaranteeing equality before and equal application of law and did not violate the right to religious freedom or right to life (guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21). 

 Another PIL on the same matter, by Anil Kumar Haritash, is pending before the Supreme Court. 

 Haritash has pleaded that the two-child norm should be implemented by all the states and not just for local body elections. 

 The court had issued notices to Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Rajasthan ? states that have already made the two-child norm binding for those contesting local body elections.

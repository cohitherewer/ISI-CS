 Ram Naik denies Iraq oil bribe

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: Former petroleum minister Ram Naik has said the Vajpayee government had declined an offer from the Saddam Hussain regime to buy oil at cheaper rates against a bribe, reports our special correspondent.

 He said he was not to blame if any of the industrialists who accompanied him to Iraq in July 2002 had paid the illegal surcharge. Naik demanded that the Pathak authority probe the involvement of Indian oil companies in the scam.

 Naik, under attack for having promoted industrialists who may have paid kickbacks to Iraqi authorities, said he had led a business team to Iraq and met Saddam on July 7, 2002.

 I had gone there in the capacity of the co-chairman of the Indo-Iraq Joint Commission. I carried a letter from the then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, for Saddam. It was a routine letter that asked the then Iraq government to facilitate our dealings.

 Akademi toll rises

 New Delhi, April 25: Ajoy Chakrabarty, the former vice-chancellor of Rabindra Bharati University, and N. Satyanarayana from Hyderabad have resigned from the general council of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, which is seeing a wave of protests against its chairperson, Odissi dancer Sonal Mansingh, reports our correspondent.

 Earlier, theatre personality Kavalam Narayana Panicker, Carnatic musician Balamuralikrishna and Manipuri actor Savitri Heisnam had submitted their resignations to protest Mansigh?s attempt to ?politicise, personalise and trivialise? the Akademi. Sources said four more artistes would send their resignation letters to culture minister S. Jaipal Reddy within 24 hours.

 Parliament or pitch? All fingers at Pawar

 New Delhi/Calcutta, Dec. 19: Parliaments current agenda features reservations for women in legislatures and for the weaker sections in the private sector. The House, though, wont mind taking time off to discuss the future of Indian sports, with some soundbites on Sourav Ganguly thrown in for good measure.

 Indian sport has never been so politicised, nor has the Lok Sabha ever meddled in team selection.

 Is it the fan fury in Calcutta that got our elected representatives so worked up, or is it the nationwide sympathy wave? Neither, if former cricketers and the games administrators are to be believed.

 The reason, they suggest, is that a politician ? Sharad Pawar ? is at the helm of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

 Obviously this is because a politician is at the top, insists Navjot Singh Sidhu, commentator and former Test opener. An industrialist (like Dalmiya) heading the BCCI is not accountable to politicians.

 Madan Lal and Anshuman Gaekwad, both of whom played for India, agree.

 The facts suggest they could be right. When Sourav was stripped of captaincy and dropped from the one-day team against Sri Lanka, his fans had been almost equally outraged. But not a single politician demanded an explanation from the then board president, Ranbir Singh Mahendra, or the real power behind him, Jagmohan Dalmiya.

 Yet, as soon as Indias most successful captain was axed from the Test side ? by when Pawar had become board chief ? the politicians clambered onto the bandwagon of nationwide protests.

 Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee pinned down civil aviation minister Praful Patel to lodge his complaint. Patel neither has additional charge of sports nor does he have anything to do with the BCCI. But he is a member of Pawars Nationalist Congress Party ? and that was enough for Chatterjee to implicate him in Souravs ouster.

 CPI leader A.B. Bardhan, never known to have unduly agitated himself over sport, could nevertheless not resist making his displeasure known to Pawar, his good friend. Would he have accosted a Mahendra or Raj Singh Dungarpur over a selection issue?

 Its also unlikely that Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ? who called up Pawar to tell him that Souravs removal was unacceptable ? would have picked up the phone had Dalmiya been board chief.

 Former Gujarat deputy chief minister Narhari Amin, now head of the Gujarat Cricket Association, also feels that if the board had a non-politician head, such a situation would have been unlikely.

 This issue needs to be explained by Pawar as BCCI president, not as a member of Parliament, he said.

 Madan Lal has no doubts about that. I have been associated with Indian cricket for 25 years and never have I seen politicians raise it in this manner before. Cricket has been completely politicised, and with politicians heading the BCCI and state cricket associations, we may see more of this. I am saddened.

 BJP leader and Delhi cricket boss Arun Jaitley, too, feels that raking up the issue in Parliament has been a mistake, but differs with the view that politicians shouldnt be running the board.

 Thats not objectionable. There are positives ? if the politician can put his weight behind the promotion of the game; and negatives ? if he bows to pressure, he said.

 Is the feeling that a politician can be pressured the impetus behind the storm of protests from Pawars colleagues?

 When Pawar said a day after the protests began that he would ask the selectors their reasons for axing Sourav, his aide and former board chief Dungarpur had strongly objected to the bad precedent this would set. Perhaps a politician is more susceptible?. he had told reporters.

 If Parliament debates the selection panels decision ? the topic has been given a veneer of gravity by being labelled the future of Indian sports ? it would be a tragedy, feels Amin. After all, the House has only so much time to decide on matters affecting millions of people.

 Reprieve for Siwan sultan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, May 9: Nearly three months after he was debarred from entering Siwan for six months by district magistrate C.K. Anil, controversial Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Mohammad Shahabuddin today won a reprieve from Saran divisional commissioner Shri Lal Sota, who quashed the collectors orders.

 The Siwan ?sultan?, however, is unlikely to enter his home turf because the police could arrest him under any of over two dozen cases he is facing. Four of these cases were filed last month when a team of the Special Task Force raided Shahabuddins village, Pratappur, and recovered arms, ammunition, deerskin and vehicles. 

 Sources close to the MP said he was, therefore, unlikely to enter the district in the near future. Fresh cases under the Arms Act, Wildlife Protection Act and Transport Act were also lodged against him.

 The Saran commissioner, before whom Shahabuddin had filed an appeal against the district magistrates externment order, found fault in the application of the provisions of the Bihar Crime Control Act, 1976, by Anil and, therefore, provided him relief.

 The district magistrate, along with superintendent of police Ratn Sanjay, has won nationwide appreciation for talking on the RJD leader, who has been notorious for his strong-arm tactics against his opponents. All political parties, except the RJD and a section of the Congress, have praised the action taken by the two young officers.

 Shahabuddin had been externed on February 19, just before the Assembly elections in the district. Then chief minister Rabri Devi had quashed an earlier order by the district magistrate shifting him to Patnas Beur Jail from the Siwan prison. 

 Patna High Court later granted him bail.

 Mines cleared on Pak bus route

 Jammu (PTI): The army has cleared landmines 

 along the Uri-Muzaffarabad stretch in Jammu and Kashmir 

 to ensure that the bus service to Pakistan rolls out on 

 April 7.

 ?Keeping pace with the time for starting the historic Indo-Pak bus service on April 7, the Uri-Muzaffarabad road stretch of nearly 6 km on the Indian side has been demined completely,? Jammu and Kashmir roads and buildings minister Gulam Ahmed Mir said.

 Landmines till the last Indian post ? called the Command Post ? in the Uri sector have been cleared by the army, the minister said.

 Mir, who reviewed the work on the Uri-Muzaffarabad road with a ?technical team of engineers? of the roads and buildings department at Uri on Saturday, said all works would be completed before the deadline.

 The army began the demining operations close to the Line of Control about a month ago to ensure timely opening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service, he said.

 Mines were placed along the stretch during Operation Parakram after the December 13, 2001, attack on Parliament. The Pakistani Army had also mined the stretch of the road under its control.

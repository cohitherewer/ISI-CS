The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Riot clause to bar newspaper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Dec. 8: A sub- divisional magistrate in Visakhapatnam yesterday clamped Section 144 around the local office of Telugu newspaper Andhra Jyoti for its alleged adverse reporting on the Congress government.

 Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code prohibits people from entering an area. In this case, it meant newspaper staff couldnt assemble in the office and therefore couldnt bring out an edition. Sub- divisional magistrates are government ? not judicial ? officers but can clamp Section 144 to maintain law and order.

 The magistrate, M. Venkateswar Rao, asked the papers editor and top management officials in Hyderabad to appear before him at Visakhapatnam tomorrow to explain why they shouldnt be stopped from publishing altogether.

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, however, directed his administration to revoke the order and punish the magistrate. He said his government had played no role in the matter. The paper printed this mornings edition despite yesterdays prohibitory orders, and with YSRs move, will be printing again tomorrow.

 The magistrates order had prompted protests by journalists in the port town with many alleging it was censorship of the worst order.

 Shadow of collapse looms on UN meet

 K.P. NAYAR

 New York, Sept. 12: Twenty-four hours before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh arrives here for the biggest gathering of leaders that the world has ever seen, India has been thrust into a critical role which can make or break the summit, which had raised high hopes for mankind until a few weeks ago.

 As leaders began arriving here today, the summit, which is due to open on Wednesday, appeared headed for a collapse because of disagreements on a blueprint to confront global challenges in the 60th year of the UN.

 In an effort to salvage the summit, Gabonese foreign minister Jean Ping, the outgoing president of the General Assembly, yesterday mandated a group of 10 countries to engage in marathon negotiations on producing a summit document, which has so far eluded the 191 members of the UN.

 India is one of those 10 countries and is represented by its permanent representative to the UN, Nirupam Sen.

 Disagreements over the summit document centre around a proposed human rights council to replace the controversial UN Human Rights Commission, creation of a peace-building commission to assist countries emerging from conflict, accountability of governments in protecting civilians from genocide, disarmament and non-proliferation issues, terrorism and the role of democracy.

 Diplomats at the UN have been labouring over the document since the beginning of this year and produced a 45-page draft last month. 

 But President George W. Bushs handpicked ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, took up his job some weeks ago and immediately tabled about 750 amendments to the draft. 

 It upset many countries, including India, because Bolton, among other things, sought to remove from the document any reference that rich nations should raise foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of their GNP. 

 He also wanted to eliminate all references to the Millennium Development Goals of the UN, adopted five years ago that would cut dire poverty and child mortality and reverse the AIDS epidemic by 2015. Other differences surfaced over landmark proposals, including some on UN reform, and the General Assembly president appointed a group of 32 countries, including India, to narrow down the differences.

 For a fortnight, this group of 32 ambassadors have been having talks, but to no avail. Yesterday, in a desperate effort to bring about a compromise before more than 170 world leaders gather at the UN, Ping cut down the negotiating group to 10 ambassadors.

 They include the five permanent members of the Security Council, India, Egypt and Pakistan. Hopes of salvaging the summit brightened after the US withdrew its insistence on eliminating all references to the Millennium Development Goals.

 Bolton also compromised on the language used in describing the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which has been rejected by the Bush administration.

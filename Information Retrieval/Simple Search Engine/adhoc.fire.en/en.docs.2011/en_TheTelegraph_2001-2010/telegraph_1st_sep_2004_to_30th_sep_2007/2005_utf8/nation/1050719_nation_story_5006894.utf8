 Count alert in tiger park 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 18: The number of tigers in the Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan has fallen from 46 in 2004 to just 26 this year, according to an official census.

 The census followed reports that said the tiger population at Ranthambore declining rapidly and which prompted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to visit the national park in May.

 Singh had also constituted a tiger task force to undertake reforms in various programmes after organised poaching and poor management wiped out an entire population of the big cats at Sariska, throwing the countrys conservation efforts into a crisis.

 The census was conducted in May-June under the supervision of the empowered committee on forests and wildlife management that Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje constituted.

 Committee chairman V.P. Singh said the report is composite as it is based on three methods of census ? the digital pugmark technique, camera trap technique and the traditional analysis of pugmarks which had come under criticism as it is dependent on the individual skills of census officers.

 The Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India planned census operations using the camera trap technique and provided technical assistance through a team of scientists and researchers. The non-government organisation, the Wildlife Protection Society of India, used the digital pugmark technique and software for estimating the tiger population. The Rajasthan forest department used the traditional method of analysing pugmarks.

 The digital method had thrown up a figure of 26 tigers, while the camera trap technique put it at 21 with a range from 15 to 27. The traditional analysis showed that there were 31 tigers. I am very pleased with the transparency of this exercise. It is a model for the rest of India to follow, said the head of the committee.

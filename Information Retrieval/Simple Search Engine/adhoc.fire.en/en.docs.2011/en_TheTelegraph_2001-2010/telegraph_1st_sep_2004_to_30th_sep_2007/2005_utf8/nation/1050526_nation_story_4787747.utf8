 Fake Rajdhani passengers held 

 Kanpur (PTI): Three persons were taken 

 into custody here for travelling on the Delhi-Guwahati Rajdhani 

 Express on tickets allegedly issued in the name of a Rashtriya 

 Janata Dal MP and his family. 

 Jai Prakash, 55, Mukesh Kumar Agrawal, 31, and Malay Mishra, 54, were held on Tuesday from the Central railway station after they were found travelling on tickets issued in the name of Sitaram Singh, his wife and an attendant, police and railway sources said. 

 The trio, travelling in an air-conditioned coach, were arrested following information from the Delhi control room. 

 Last month, supporters of a group of Bihar MPs, including Union minister Shakeel Ahmed of the Congress and RJDs Raghunath Jha and Devendra Yadav, were found travelling without tickets on the Howrah-bound Rajdhani Express.

 HC raps Centre on mosque

 New Delhi: Delhi High Court has taken 

 exception to the Centres failure to produce the complete 

 records, as asked, relating to the Union ministry of cultures 

 decision not to declare the 355-year-old Jama Masjid a protected 

 monument, reports our correspondent.

 The ministry decision had been conveyed by the Prime Minister in a letter to Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari ? a move that was questioned by the court when Archaeological Survey of India counsel Sanjay Jain mentioned it on April 27, 2005.

 The court, which asked how the letter got written to the imam when the owner of the mosque is the Delhi Wakf Board, had then ordered the culture ministry to produce the records relating to the decision.

 The bench found that the file submitted by the ministry did not have records of any government communication on the status of the imam or the Delhi Wakf Board in relation to the mosque.

 Additional solicitor-general P.P. Malhotra has been asked to produce the missing page no. 9 of the 35-page file on Thursday.

 The division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul was hearing a public interest litigation by Heritage and Culture Forum, which wants the Jama Masjid declared a protected monument.

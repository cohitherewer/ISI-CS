 Ban on handbags in Delhi halls

 new delhi (PTI): 

 In the wake of the twin cinema blasts, Delhi police have 

 banned all boxes, handbags or containers capable of hiding 

 explosives or arms from being carried into any place of 

 public entertainment.

 Police commissioner K.K. Paul issued an order prohibiting the carrying of any box, including tiffin box, bag, handbag and any other container capable of concealing any arm/firearm/explosive material inside any place of public amusement, including cinema halls.

 The order will be enforced from June 9 till August 7.

 The four men who carried out the blasts had hidden components of the bombs in their shoes and underwear, the police said. These were later assembled inside the bathrooms of the two halls.

 Two alleged Babbar Khalsa activists held in connection with the blasts have been remanded in police custody for 10 days.

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Madhu Jain remanded Balvinder Singh and Jagannath Yadav in custody till June 10 after the police sought time for their interrogation. Two of their associates, Jaspal Singh and Vikas, are still on the run.

 Sati book flak for Rajasthan 

 new delhi (PTI): 

 The National Commission for Women has sent a notice to Rajasthans 

 chief secretary demanding action against those involved 

 in the publication of a book brought out by the state government.

 Rajasthan Ke Lok Devi-Devta allegedly highlights the practice of sati while enlisting the places of worship in the state.

 The panel has also sought explanation from the government why an activist, Kavita Srivastava, was not able to file an FIR on the book. Police had only lodged a complaint.

 As per the Prevention of Sati Act 1987, which defines what comprises glorification of sati, supporting, justifying or propagating the practice in any manner is banned, said NCW chairperson Girija Vyas.

 The book clearly propagates the practice, which is a criminal offence as per the act.

 The publication, a guidebook on temples in the state written by Mahendra Bhanawat, was commissioned by Rajasthans tourism and devesthan department.

 The government has been asked to take action against the writer, the publisher and the department officials.

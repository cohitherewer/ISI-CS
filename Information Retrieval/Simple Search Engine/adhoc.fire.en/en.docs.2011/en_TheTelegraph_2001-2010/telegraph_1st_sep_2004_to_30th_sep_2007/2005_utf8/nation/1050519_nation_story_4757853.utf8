 DU gears for entrance rush

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, May 18: With ISC results declared 

today and CBSE results scheduled to be released on May 23, Delhi Universitys 

78 colleges are preparing for the admission rush.

 Most of these colleges will start issuing and accepting applications from June 1. Some colleges, like St Stephens, however, began their admission procedure on May 16, issuing application forms and setting the dates for entrance exams to their various courses. 

 Most North Campus colleges offer online admissions, where students can fill in forms and submit them online. Some like Hindu and Sri Ram College of Commerce charge extra for this, but others like Kirori Mal and Hansraj offer the facility free of cost. Most of the colleges conduct admission tests, particularly for BA (Hons) in English and Economics.

 A list of English entrance exam schedules for 22 DU colleges has been worked out. After the written tests, some colleges also hold interviews. 

 Students can buy centralised admission forms from any of the 15 counters in the university. For the first time, the university has brought out a prospectus, priced Rs 20, that gives details of the courses and the colleges.

 Hostel admissions begin in mid-July after admissions are over. 

 More information will be available on www.du.ac.in.

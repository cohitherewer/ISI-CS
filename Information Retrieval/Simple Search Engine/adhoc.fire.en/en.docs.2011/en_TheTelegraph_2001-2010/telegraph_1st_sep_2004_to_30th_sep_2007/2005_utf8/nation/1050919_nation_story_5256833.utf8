The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pat and prick in same breath

 Excerpts from the text of L.K. Advanis statement at the BJP national executive in Chennai on Sunday:

 In free Indias political history, the launching of the BJP in 1980 has really proved a landmark event. The Indian polity has undergone a radical metamorphosis in these past 25 years.

 Personally, I deem it a proud privilege that while the first session was presided over by Shri A.B. Vajpayee, the partys silver jubilee session being held this December at Mumbai is going to be presided over by me. 

 I had accepted this responsibility as party president in October 2004 because Shri Venkaiahji had some personal problems. I have decided, however, that after the Mumbai session, I shall demit office and the partys stewardship should be taken over by some other colleague.

 From time to time, and depending on the issue at hand, the BJP leadership has had no hesitation in consulting the RSS functionaries.

 After such consultations, the party takes its own independent decisions. Some of these decisions may differ ? and have indeed differed ? from the stated positions of the RSS and certain constituents of the Sangh parivar.

 But lately an impression has gained ground that no political or organisational decision can be taken without the consent of the RSS functionaries.

 This perception, we hold, will do no good either to the party or to the RSS. The RSS, too, must be concerned that such a perception will dwarf its greater mission of man making and nation building. Both the RSS and the BJP must consciously exert to dispel this impression.

 We feel that the RSS should continue to play its role to strengthen the ethical, moral and idealistic moorings of the workers as well as functionaries of the BJP, as in the past, and this is in the larger interest of the nation.

 The BJP greatly appreciates the continuing interaction we have been having with the RSS and with other organisations in the Sangh parivar. Their views provide valuable inputs for our decision-making process.

 But the BJP as a political party is accountable to the people, its performance being periodically put to test in elections.

 So in a democratic, multi-party polity, an ideologically-driven party like the BJP has to function in a manner that enables it to keep its basic ideological stances intact and at the same time expand itself to reach the large sections of the people outside the layers of all ideology.

 It is in protecting the ideological moorings of the BJP and in articulating it in an idiom and language that the people understand that great care is needed. 

 For us in the BJP, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya has been a model ideologue. We have seen him interpret the partys ideological commitments, as for example in respect of Akhand Bharat, with remarkable clarity and conviction, and yet with flexibility and finesse.

 The RSS is a nationalist organisation whose contribution to character building of millions and towards inculcating in them the spirit of patriotism, idealism and selfless service of the motherland has been incomparable. 

 It is an organisation that has inspired tens of thousands of public-spirited persons to serve the nation through the medium of politics. Those in the political field and those who are serving the society in other fields have to function with unity and trust like a family to ensure that the country secures its rightful place in the comity of nations.

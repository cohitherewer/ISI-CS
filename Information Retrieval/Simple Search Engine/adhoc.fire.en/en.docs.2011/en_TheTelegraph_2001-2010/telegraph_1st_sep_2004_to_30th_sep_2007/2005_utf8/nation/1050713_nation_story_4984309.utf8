 Speaker seal on Rane exit 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 12: The sound of crackers said it all.

 As a bitter Narayan Rane retreated to fight another day, Uddhav Thackerays supporters danced to the beat of drums and burst crackers at the Shiv Sena headquarters after Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Balasaheb Kupekar ruled in favour of the party.

 Kupekar upheld the election of Ramdas Kadam as leader of the Sena legislature party and the decision to expel Rane at the July 6 meeting of party legislators. The ruling gave legitimacy to the group of 51 MLAs supporting Sena executive president Uddhav.

 Rane, whose July 8 meeting ended in a flop show ?only nine legislators made it to his official bungalow ? later resigned as leader of Opposition, but not before bitterly criticising the Sena leadership in an emotional speech.

 The day began with Sena and BJP leaders meeting the Speaker and submitting a memorandum seeking removal of Rane as leader of Opposition in the House.

 After the proceedings started, Kupekar upheld the decisions taken at the July 6 meeting that elected Uddhav loyalist Kadam leader in place of Rane and appointed Gajanan Kirtikar as chief whip and replaced Rane loyalists Kalidas Kolambkar and Vinayak Nimhan with Uddhav supporters as whips.

 As news of the Speakers decision spread, Uddhav drove to the partys Nariman Point headquarters and addressed jubilant Sena workers. He accused Rane of taking advantage of his father Bal Thackerays ill heath.

 Rane tried to take advantage of the ill health of the Sena supremo. He was under the impression that it was he alone who maintained and operated the Sena and tried to take over the party, Uddhav said.

 The rebel leader reacted to the charge by describing the Sena as the Thackeray familys fief. How can I take over the party. Shiv Sena is the personal property of the Thackeray family, he told reporters at his official bungalow where hundreds of restive supporters hung around, uncertain about the political future of their leader.

 Rane confirmed that he had held talks with Nationalist Congress Party leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel last night, but refused to reveal details. It is believed that the NCP promised a central berth for Rane and assured that some of his loyal MLAs could be given ministries in the Democratic Front government in Maharashtra.

 Sena leader Subhash Desai indicated that the party would not take disciplinary action against the MLAs who had sided with Rane. The hint was if they return to Uddhavs camp, they would not face disqualification.

 Muslim vote dogs RJD

 Samastipur, Feb. 22: The most striking imponderable in the Bihar Assembly elections is whether Laloo Prasad Yadav?s successful Muslim-Yadav combine has frayed and, more importantly, to what extent.

 If the damage is minimal, even his opponents concede it would only make a difference of ?10 or 15 seats? to his overall tally.

 If the dent is huge, it would signal the end of his Rashtriya Janata Dal?s 15-year rule and the emergence of a host of scenarios, including one in which Laloo Prasad may be forced to accept a non-RJD chief minister in the cause of ?secularism?. Ram Vilas Paswan, on the other hand, has spoken of having a Muslim chief minister. 

 While no Muslim has bitten the bait ? if they are voting the Lok Janshakti Party, it is for other reasons ? unlike in the past, when security was the central issue for the community, this time, development or the lack of it is as weighty. However, local leaders are weighing the pros and cons of seeing the end of Laloo Prasad with the option of political uncertainty that, they believe, may breathe life into ?communal? forces. 

 For every Aslam Raza of Madhubani?s Madrasa Faizan-e-Raza, who said: ?Teachers have not been paid salaries for years and are unable to get their daughters married off?, there is a Muslim who places a premium on peace before development. 

 Habib-ur-Rehman, the joint secretary of the Al Jamiat-ul-Ghousiya, a madarsa run by Samastipur?s Jama Masjid, said: ?For 15 years, there was little or nothing by way of development. If he (Laloo Prasad) doesn?t deliver this time, we will leave him just like we left the Congress.?

 If Muslims are willing to give the RJD one more chance, it is for two reasons. Maulana Syed Nizamuddin, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board based in Phulwari Sharief near Patna, explained: ?Laloo is the only political leader who has openly opposed fascism and communalism. There were no riots in his rule. When there were clashes, he personally ensured things did not go out of hand. As for development, so far Laloo had the excuse that since there was a hostile NDA government, which did not give funds, he could do nothing. That has gone, so if he comes back to power, he will face a big test.?

 The Yadavs fall into two categories: the literate and relatively better off feel empowerment is over and done with, they have to go beyond that and elect a ?serious? leader and not a ?clown?. The majority still swears by Laloo Prasad.

 Dhepur, a Yadav-dominated village in Dalsingsarai Assembly constituency of Begusarai, is an example of the former. With its pucca houses ? built as part of the Indira Awaas Yojana, implemented by the RJD government ? lush fields and well-dressed residents, this village has no use for Laloo Prasad?s political histrionics.

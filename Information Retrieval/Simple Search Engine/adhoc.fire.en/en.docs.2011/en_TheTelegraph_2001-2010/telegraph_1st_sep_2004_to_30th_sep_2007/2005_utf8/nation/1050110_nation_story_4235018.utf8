 Unspoilt beaches await next season

 Havelock, Jan. 9: Beaches of glistening white run into aquamarine waters, aquamarine plunges into emerald depths. And not a soul in sight. 

 This is Havelock. The tsunami has swept away the tourists, in peak season, transforming this breathtaking destination of towering trees, white sands and crystal clear waters into little more than a desert island, save its small native population. 

 Though the key beaches ? which would put any other in India to shame ? have hardly been affected, the administration is not encouraging tourists to come here now. ?By next season (October to May), everything should be back to normal,? said a spokesperson of the directorate of information, press and tourism (IP amp;T). 

 For the thousands of islanders dependent on tourist rupees (and a few dollars and euros), this could prove disastrous. Investors, too, have felt the blow already. Silver Sands is the newest destination on Havelock, a star property which opened 14 rooms on December 16. Almost full from the outset, it was emptied out 10 days later. 

 ?This season was looking good, so we completed the property in six months. We had enquiries from as far away as Japan, Korea and Taiwan. It will take a while for people to come back,? said hotelier Girish Arora. 

 Small-time travel agent Rishi, a Bengali who rents out a few cars and runs a restaurant, has already called on his bank about the mortgage on his vehicles. 

 Tourist numbers had only picked up a few years ago, with the government promoting it since 1995. Last year, 110,000 tourists ? domestic and foreign ? visited the archipelago, bringing in over Rs 1 crore through government properties alone. Just two hours from Port Blair by high-speed boat, most tourists to the Emerald Islands would take off for Havelock. But given that the beaches on this island (and others throughout the Andamans) have been given A and A+ rating by the World Tourism Organisation, the current numbers are nothing. Indians would usually stick to a day trip and foreigners would most likely be backpackers on shoestring budgets. As a result, most supposed resorts here are shacks, with a few camping sites thrown in. 

 But the landscape was changing for the better before the killer waves knocked things off track. Apart from Silver Sands, Jungle Resort, owned by the Barefoot group, has also just been revamped into a luxury destination, at considerable expense. From a full house, occupancy has shrunk now to one room, that too at a slashed rate. 

 The administration has long recognised the need to promote tourism. ?A proposal has been pending before the cabinet commission on economic affairs on this matter,? explained the IP amp;T spokesman. Large numbers are not going to be the target, though. ?We want sensible groups of tourists who will appreciate eco-tourism and not jeopardise the biodiversity of the area.?

 Certain hurdles stand in the way, air fares and connectivity being the biggest ones. Here, too, the tsunami has played its part. Barefoot was to start operating a Bangkok-Port Blair flight from January, which has been put on hold. The proposal also recommends introduction of apex fares, flights from Delhi and Mumbai, and more private flights from Calcutta. 

 Luxury hotels are few at the moment, but government land will be offered to private promoters. Ten out of 572 islands will be promoted as destinations ? Havelock, Neil, North Passage, South Andaman, Ross amp; Smith, Little Andaman, Rutland, Interview, Cinque and Long. Promoters will also have to keep in mind the limited load capacity and infrastructure on the islands, as well as restrictions according to Coastal Zonal Regulations. The Nicobar group is out of bounds. 

 But all considered, the Andaman islands have enough to offer to ? and even more to gain from ? tourists hungry for its beautiful shores.

 BJP-bashing, out of syllabus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 27: Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh sparred with Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and also took potshots at his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi at a meeting of the National Development Council today.

 Education being the focus of the session chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the HRD minister had gone to the meeting with a nine-page speech dealing with different aspects of the issue. But he did not use a line from the speech and instead delivered an impromptu address, which turned out to be more about politics than education.

 The provocation came from Modi who spoke just before the HRD minister. The BJP chief minister made a strident presentation of the Gujarat governments achievements and blamed the Centre for not giving enough funds to the state.

 He claimed the state government already had the basic infrastructure for the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a primary education programme, but needed funds from the Centre to upgrade them.

 When Singhs turn came, he said Modi belonged to a party which had used education to push through a political agenda when it was in power at the Centre. Education needs to be inclusive and for the benefit of all, said the HRD minister.

 Joshis five-year tenure as HRD minister in the National Democratic Alliance government left many Muslim educational institutions unhappy, as they felt he neglected their concerns, he said.

 There can be no monopoly and no single individual or group can claim to have exclusive monopoly over how the education process in a country like India should be carried out, said Singh. After taking charge of the ministry, Singh has constituted a minority educational commission.

 Singh believes the RSS always targets education as a soft area which can be tampered with to propagate a particular kind of education and culture. The Sangh parivar had showered accolades on Joshi for his performance as HRD minister.

 Singh faulted Joshi for not reconstituting the Central Advisory Board of Education. Joshi had pushed through a controversial school curriculum and controversial textbooks without the mandatory sanction from the board.

 The body, which Singh reconstituted after taking charge, recently approved a new curriculum drawn up by experts appointed by the ministry.

 The United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme mandated Singh to detoxify the education system. He replaced heads of educational institutions appointed by Joshi and restored the autonomy to IITs and IIMs which Joshi had stripped them of. 

 Joshi has criticised Singh for undoing the work done by him and former NCERT director J.S. Rajput.

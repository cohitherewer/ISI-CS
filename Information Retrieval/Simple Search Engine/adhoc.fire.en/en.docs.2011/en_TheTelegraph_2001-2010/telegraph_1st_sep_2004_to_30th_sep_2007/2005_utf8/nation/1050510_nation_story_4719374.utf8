 Laloo Prasad: Gift for Sangh

 New Delhi, May 9: Thank Laloo Prasad Yadav, the RSS can happily stick with its lathis at its shakhas and drills.

 With virtually a single wave of his hand, the railway minister today ensured the proposed ban on carrying sticks and lathis during processions and parades is quickly mothballed.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil was just about to reply to the discussion on the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2005, when Laloo Prasad strode in. On a cue from him, his flock raised so much heat and dust in the House that Patil swiftly rolled back the ?arms? tag he had intended to stick on the lathis.

 ?Lathi can be used as a weapon. It can be better used than the sword,? said Patil. But carrying lathis/sticks per se will not be an offence under the proposed law, he announced. 

 ?As a majority of members think that flags on lathis or those carried by farmers, aged or injured persons should not be treated as weapons, let me follow the procedures to make corrections on the provision regarding lathis,? he said.

 The amendment to the CrPC had proposed to empower district magistrates ?to ban the carrying of arms in any procession or organising or holding of any mass drill or mass training in any public place?.

 An offender was to be awarded imprisonment of up to six months and slapped a fine of Rs 2,000.

 Had Laloo Prasad not led the charge from the front, the RSS would have been in a spot. At its shakhas, volunteers carry lathis as a matter of practice. And with the BJP opting to boycott Parliament, there was no way the Sangh could have protested the provision, a leader said.

 The CrPC bill, which sailed through the Lok Sabha in the absence of any opposition, was taken up for discussion in the post-lunch session. Once RJD legislators Devendra Prasad Yadav and Ram Kripal Yadav and Samajwadi Party MP Ramjilal Suman took the floor, there was little Patil could do but offer ?to make corrections?.

 Ram Kripal questioned how a lathi could be blacklisted as a ?weapon? when Mahatma Gandhi, the very votary of non-violence, had leant on one. Besides, ?farmers habitually carried lathis while some do so to ward off animals. Sick persons also need sticks and lathis for support?.

 Not only that, party workers carrying flags and buntings on sticks during political rallies could be harassed by a biased DM and their arrests ordered, the RJD legislators said. Devendra pointed out they were used in Muharram processions, too.

 Through the ruckus, Sonia Gandhi remained seated beside Patil. Laloo Prasad was seen frequently discussing something with her.

 Mumbai, Nov. 4: In another blow to the Shiv Sena, three MLAs supporting rebel-turned-Congress minister Narayan Rane today resigned from the Assembly and joined the Congress.

 Speaker Babasaheb Kupekar accepted the resignations of Subhash Bane, Shankar Kambli, and Ganpat Kadam, all from the Konkan region, today. 

 Later, Rane and state Congress chief Prabha Rau announced their coming over. The trio is part of the group of 10 MLAs who had pledged support to Rane, but did not follow him into the Congress after his resignation from the Sena on June 24. With a fortnight to go for Ranes November 19 by-election in Malwan constituency, the move is expected to boost his chances.

 The resignations gain political significance for a another reason. They would reduce the strength of the Sena in the Assembly from the current 62 to 59. Rane said seven other members of his support group in the Sena would resign next month ahead of the winter session of the Assembly in Nagpur. That would cut Senas strength to 52, two less than electoral partner BJPs 54. 

 The BJP has already indicated that it would stake its claim to the Opposition leaders post if it has more numbers than the Sena.

 The resignations are also worrying the National Congress Party (NCP), which currently has 71 MLAs compared to 69 of the Congress and has been bargaining for a greater say in seat-sharing and running the government.

 After the success in the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation polls last month, NCPs deputy chief minister, R.R. Patil, had demanded that the seat-sharing formula with the Congress be changed.

 The NCP fears that if Ranes group of 10 MLAs joins the Congress and gets re-elected in the subsequent by-polls, it would boost the Congress strength to 79, closing the door on any political bargaining for the rest of the Vilasrao Deshmukh regimes five-year term.

 Asked to comment on Patils statement on changing the seat-sharing formula, the state Congress chief said: If that is so, we will also change the strategy.

 If the NCP wants a change, the partys state unit chief Arun Gujarati should inform us. He has not spoken to me, and I do not know whether Patil has become the party president now.

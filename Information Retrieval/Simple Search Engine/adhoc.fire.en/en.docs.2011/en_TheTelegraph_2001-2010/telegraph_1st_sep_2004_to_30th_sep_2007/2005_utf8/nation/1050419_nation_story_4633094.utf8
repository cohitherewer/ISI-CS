 Engineer missing on way home

 SALMAN RAVI

 Ranchi, April 18: An executive engineer, posted with the Rural Engineering Organisation (REO) at Godda near Hazaribagh, has gone missing since yesterday evening. 

 Yamuna Prasad Lakhiramka was last seen driving a car on his way home to Deoghar from office.

 Godda superintendent of police Umesh Prasad Singh claimed that though Lakhiramka had a driver with him, he was behind the wheel when last seen. 

 He said Lakhiramka has been posted in Godda for more than eight years and did not rule out the involvement of organised gangs from north Bihar. 

 Police sources said Lakhiramka had left his office for home around 6.30 pm on a Maruti Van (JH-15C-1841). ?Till late in the evening, his family waited for him thinking that he might have been held back with office work. But when he did not turn up even this morning, they informed the police,? a source said. 

 A case has been lodged at the Godda Sadar police station. ?We are trying our best to find out which gang had a hand in the abduction. Some history-sheeters have already been rounded up and we are interrogating them. But, no clues could be gathered from them yet,? a police source said.

 Godda police have sealed the borders with other districts. A general alert has also been sounded in the adjacent Deoghar district where the engineer?s family lives.

 Police sources said Lakhiramka was considered to be a close aide of Godda MLA Manoharlal Tekriwal of the BJP. 

 The police are also trying to find out about the contractors were working with different REO projects being executed under the engineer?s supervision.

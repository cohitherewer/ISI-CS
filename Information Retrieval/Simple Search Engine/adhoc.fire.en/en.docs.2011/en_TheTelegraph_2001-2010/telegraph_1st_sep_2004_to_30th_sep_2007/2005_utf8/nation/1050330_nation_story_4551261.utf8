 Left smells hire-fire in reform call

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 29: Left parties are protesting the Centre?s move to reopen discussion on labour law reforms, which involve the contentious easy hire-fire system and contractual employment.

 The protest followed Union labour minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao?s meeting with industry representatives today to discuss the reforms. Rao will meet trade union leaders on Thursday and state representatives later.

 ?The government has revived the debate on hire and fire,? Citu leader W.R. Wardharajan said.

 He did not deny the need to update labour laws, especially in view of the globalised economy, but added a rider. ?Labour laws need to be updated but not necessarily in favour of employers.?

 Left trade unions, for instance, want eliminated the divergence in income parameters in labour laws that decide the eligibility of workers for various benefits like bonus and provident fund.

 The bonus act, for instance, lays down an income limit of Rs 3,500 and the payment of wages act Rs 1,600. ?Each law has a different income eligibility ceiling,? Wardharajan said.

 But the main bone of contention is Chapter V(B) of the Industrial Disputes Act that seeks to do away with the present safeguards against an easy hire-and-fire system.

 At present, factory owners have to obtain the permission of the state or the Centre before closing down or locking out their units. Industrialists are all for an easy hire-fire system but not trade unions.

 Labour leaders are also opposed to the contract labour act, which will make jobs of perennial nature contractual.

 ?At present, the core jobs are of a perennial nature. For instance, all activities related to the manufacturing sector are core area jobs,? Wardharajan said.

 The Left stresses that the UPA?s common minimum programme is categorically opposed to hire-fire. ?The UPA rejects the idea of automatic hire and fire,? says the programme. ?It recognises that some changes in labour laws may be required but that such changes must fully protect the interests of workers and families and there must be full consultation with trade unions,? it adds.

 The programme, however, makes it clear that the UPA government plans labour law reforms other than hire-fire. ?Labour laws other than Industrial Disputes Act that can bring about a licence raj will be re-examined and procedures will be streamlined,? it says.

 But trade unions believe that the real issue of labour law reforms is to facilitate easy hire-fire and to have all jobs on contract. ?All trade unions, barring the Intuc and the BMS, are meeting on May 5 to discuss it,? Wardharajan said.

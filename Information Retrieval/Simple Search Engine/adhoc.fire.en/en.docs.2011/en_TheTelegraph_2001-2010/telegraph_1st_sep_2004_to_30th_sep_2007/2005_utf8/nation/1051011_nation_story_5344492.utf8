 Help too slow to come, looting rules

 Oct. 10 (Agencies): Without food, clothes or medicine and angry at the poor relief efforts, the people of devastated Pakistan-occupied Kashmir today tried to help themselves by the only means left: looting.

 In Muzaffarabad, a reporter saw shopkeepers scuffle with people who were trying to break locks of shuttered businesses. They beat each other with sticks and threw stones and some people were left with bleeding head wounds. No police were visible.

 Hungry and desperate people even looted army trucks, which moved in carrying food, tents, blankets and medicines after a road was opened in Muzaffarabad. 

 The survivors have been without food and water for three days.

 Residents also reported that people had started looting deserted homes and even petrol stations.

 People have started looting things from shops. They have lost everything, they have no clothes, no food, nothing, said Asim Butt, a resident of the city. There was anger on the streets.

 Not a single government agency has done anything for two days. People are taking out the bodies by themselves, said Shamsher Ali, another resident.

 Government leaders are giving a false impression in the media. Theres been no rescue work, one angry man shouted.

 A small team of soldiers with spades over their shoulders was seen heading down a main street this morning.

 Theyve just arrived, said newspaper reporter Raja Iftikhar. For two days, the military and police were not operating.

 Conceding that several remote areas have not been reached so far, President Pervez Musharraf said: We are trying to reach remote areas ? there are villages which have been razed to the ground.

 We are trying to take satellite photograph and imagery of the damage to find out exactly the remote areas we need to go because access to those areas is only (by) road, which is blocked (by landslides).

 The army was flying food, water and medicines into some of the disaster-hit areas. The US military plans to send eight helicopters from Afghanistan.

 Saturdays earthquake wiped out entire villages, buried roads in rubble and knocked out electricity and water supplies. It killed 40,000 people in Pakistan, 25,000 of them in PoK alone.

 Delhi, which till this afternoon had counted 865 dead, including 71 defence personnel, fears the toll may cross 1,000 in Jammu and Kashmir.

 The United Nations has warned that over 25 lakh people are in need of shelter.

 People in Muzaffarabad say they have nothing and approach visitors for money, medicine and water. Children with grubby bandages on heads and hands are everywhere.

 About 2,000 people huddled around campfires through the cold night on a soccer field on the citys university campus, where most buildings had collapsed and hundreds were feared trapped inside. Soldiers with shovels and iron bars were trying to burrow into the concrete to find survivors.

 Every building in the small city appears destroyed or damaged. Groups of people were carrying bodies through the streets or pushing them on trolleys. Crushed cars are everywhere, sticking out of mounds of rubble.

 Hundreds of Muzaffarabad people working elsewhere have been streaming back to the city to find relatives. I cant recognise this place, said one man arriving back.

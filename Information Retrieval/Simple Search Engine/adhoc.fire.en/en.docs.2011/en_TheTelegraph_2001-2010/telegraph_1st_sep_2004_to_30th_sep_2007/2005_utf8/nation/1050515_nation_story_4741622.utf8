 Cash amp; gods to lure voters

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Kancheepuram, May 14: Politicians are cashing in on divinity, literally.

 Crisp Reserve Bank of India notes rolled out of the ruling ADMKs purse, along with pictures of local deities, as Kancheepuram and Gummidipoondi went to polls today.

 Stakes were high for both the ADMK and the DMK in two Assembly byelections.

 RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav had landed in a spot during campaigning for the Bihar elections in January when he displayed his generous side to his constituency. 

 Unfortunately for him, he not only caught the attention of voters but also that of the Election Commission, which reprimanded him and put him on notice. 

 Down south, however, the parties seem to be carrying out operations quite neatly. This despite the poll panels strict watch ? it has clamped down with the severest-ever rulebook on the conduct of a bypoll.

 The commissions special observer, K.J. Rao, has ordered the pulling down of unauthorised political hoardings and cut-outs. He did not mince words while telling even top leaders to stay off the two constituencies after campaigning came to a close. 

 The parties were careful to wrap up the cash-distribution exercise before the central paramilitary forces landed.

 The ploy seems to have worked. Voters have been flocking polling stations in hordes since morning, braving the harsh sun. 

 From the ADMK side, the bigger party functionaries from various districts, with the help of their local counterparts, doled out to every household a minimum of Rs 100, going up to Rs 150 and even Rs 200 in some pockets, a voter said.

 Just to ensure a higher level of commitment, the cash was accompanied by small photos of the principal deities, depending on from where the party organiser came from, another added. 

 If the organiser was from Kancheepuram, the envelope came along with a picture of goddess Kamakshi, the presiding deity at the Kamakshi Amman Temple. 

 Another party bigwig hailing from Palani not only distributed cash accompanied by a small photograph of Dandayuthapani Swami, but also gave away panchamritham, the temple prasad made up of a mix of fruits and honey. 

 The DMK, however, could not match its rivals largesse. It made a token offer quietly on the sidelines, ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 100 per household, in several pockets of the constituency, voters said. 

 In Gummidipoondi, too, it was more or less the same story. The ADMK even earned the sobriquet Vallal, which means a liberal donor.

 PMK MP held

 Local PMK MP and former Union minister of state for railways, A.K. Murthy, was arrested for visiting Kancheepuram on the day of the bypoll.

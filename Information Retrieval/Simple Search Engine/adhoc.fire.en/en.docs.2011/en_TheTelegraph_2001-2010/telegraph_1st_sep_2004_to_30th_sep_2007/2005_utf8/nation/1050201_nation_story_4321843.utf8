 Economists plump for child labour

 London, Jan. 31: Its horrors were highlighted by Charles Dickens and countless campaigners since, but child labour ? including prostitution, mining, deep-sea fishing and drug-trafficking ? should not be banned in poor countries, according to a study by the Royal Economic Society.

 The research, by two professors of economics, says that making the worst forms of child labour illegal is misguided, does more harm than good, and can damage the economy and the living standards of many families in developing nations. India has about 1.2 crore child labourers.

 The study says that a worldwide ban, championed by the International Labour Organisation and supported by 151 countries, could deprive families of money that might otherwise be used to pay for children?s food and education.

 ?Where there is a choice, the worst forms of child labour will usually be chosen because they pay better than other forms, considered ?non-harmful?,? the report says.

 ?The market for the worst forms of child labour helps to keep wages in the market for the ?good? forms of child labour sufficiently high to help poor families finance their children?s education.?

 The authors argue that forcing all working children to do non-harmful child labour would lead to an overall drop in children?s wages, ?with adverse consequences for the welfare of all poor families?.

 The research, A Theory of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, by Canadian University professors Sylvain Dessy and St?phane Pallage appears in the Economic Journal, published this week.

 The ILO, a United Nations agency, has campaigned against child labour for decades. It says worldwide more than 250 million children, aged five to 14 ? including 153 million in Asia and 80 million in Africa ? are in work, half of them full time. Many work in hazardous conditions as prostitutes, drug-traffickers, in quarries and mines or on farms and in factories.

 The organisation?s 1973 Convention 138, ratified by 135 countries, bans all forms of child labour, but in 1999 a new Convention 182 shifted this to cover only the worst examples. That convention has been ratified by 182 countries, including all developed nations, apart from Australia.

 The new study argues that tackling poverty would be a better way to reduce child labour than using legislation.

 ?The worst forms of child labour are all intrinsically linked to poverty,? the study says. 

 ?Either poverty makes parents choose to submit their children to these kinds of activities (in which case the ban will constrain them further), or poverty acts as a catalyst to child trafficking? which is already recognised as a criminal activity worldwide.?

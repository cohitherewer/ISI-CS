 Industrialists let off

 R. VENKATARAMAN 

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: After 14 years of fierce legal battle, the Supreme Court today acquitted five accused, including industrialists, in the Shankar Guha Niyogi murder case and sent assailant Paltan Mallah to life imprisonment.

 The CBI and the trade union leader?s Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha had challenged a high court order acquitting all six in the case. The trial court had convicted all six and sentenced Mallah to death. 

 Letting off the owners of the Simplex and Kedia groups today, a division bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and A.R. Lakshmanan said: ?Motive (to kill Niyogi) by itself is not sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused.?

 The prosecution had argued that the industrialists had hatched a conspiracy to eliminate Niyogi, who had started an agitation in Bhilai demanding regularisation of the services of workers and payment of minimum wages. 

 The judges said although that could be a motive, it was not enough to prove that they had actually organised the murder in 1991.

 ?The overall evidence examined by the prosecution would only show that some agitation had been going on against the management of these industries and the deceased Niyogi was spearheading many of these. This by itself would not prove the prosecution case of conspiracy,? Justice Balakrishnan said, writing the judgment.

 Niyogi had mentioned in his diary in 1991 that he apprehended ?some danger? at the hands of ?some industrialists? because of the agitation. But the judges held that ?even though he had mentioned the names of some of the accused in the diary? that by itself may not be of any assistance to the prosecution to prove the case as the entries do not refer to any event which ultimately was the cause of his death?.

 The prosecution contended that the industrialists had kept the registration number of Niyogi?s car and a jeep belonging to his Chhattsigarh Mukti Morcha which ?would show that the accused were watching the movements of the deceased Niyogi?. The judges replied ?we are not able to attach any importance to these documents?.

 ?Though there is no direct and convincing evidence against the other accused, the case against Paltan Mallah is proved beyond reasonable doubt. He was acquitted by the high court on fanciful reasons,? the bench said while reversing his acquittal.

 Coming to the sentence, the bench said as there was a long lapse of time since the murder, ?we do not think that the sentence of death imposed upon him by the sessions court is justified in the circumstances?.

 Justice impossible in Bihar: Lalu

 Lalu Prasad: Fair trail wanted

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: Bihars dethroned monarch does not trust his fate in his former kingdom.

 Lalu Prasad Yadav today sprang a surprise before the Supreme Court, requesting transfer of the fodder scam cases out of the state as he would not get justice.

 He would not get justice in BJP-ruled Jharkhand, too, the railway minister contended.

 The apex court fixed January 10 for further hearings to know what the changed circumstances were in which Lalu Prasad saw no free and fair trial in Bihar, a state he ruled for 15 years before his party was humbled in the last elections.

 It has now become impossible to seek justice in Bihar and Jharkhand courts, Lalu Prasads counsel Ram Jethmalani said, alluding to the change of guard in the state.

 The senior counsel said the courts October 26 order implied that the chief justice of Patna High Court could transfer the trial judge in the fodder scam cases. He told a three-judge bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan, A.R. Lakshmanan and S.H. Kapadia that his client would file a proper application soon requesting transfer of trial outside Bihar.

 The judges said there was no directive to the chief justice of the high court to change or transfer the trial judge in the fodder scam cases. But Jethmalani persisted with the argument that no free and fair trial would be possible in Bihar for his client.

 The arguments continued on a writ petition by Janata Dal (United) leader Rajiv Ranjan Singh Lallan and BJP leader and deputy chief minister Sushil Modi.

 The petition sought cancellation of bail to both Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi, the toppled chief minister, on the ground that they were using their political influence to tamper with evidence and influence witnesses.

 Earlier, the court had ordered Patna High Court to explain under what circumstances previous judges handling the cases were transferred.

 Lallan and Modi alleged that Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi used their political clout to transfer the trial judges and also succeeded in getting a clean chit from the Income Tax department.

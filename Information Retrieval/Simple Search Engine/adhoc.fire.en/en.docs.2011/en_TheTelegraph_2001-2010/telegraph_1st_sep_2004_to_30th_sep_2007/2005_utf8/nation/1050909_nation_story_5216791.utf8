 Onions send Cong looking for cover

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The ruling Congress-led alliance today mulled banning the export of the politically sensitive crop, onion, worried that its price was spiralling out of control before the crucial Bihar Assembly elections.

 Floods in Maharashtra and Karnataka, where most onions are grown in South Asia, have seen fewer truckloads of the staple vegetable of most Indian households reaching markets.

 Prices have doubled in wholesale markets from Rs 5-6 a kilo to Rs 10-12, raising fears of an onion crisis that could see tears not only in the eyes of consumers but also of ruling party politicians who would be under attack for not ensuring adequate supplies.

 Prices of onions, along with those of cooking oil, sugar, wheat and rice, are considered extremely sensitive politically as they form part of every Indians cuisine.

 A sudden spurt in onion prices in 1999 had seen the then chief minister Sushma Swaraj and her BJP-run Delhi government being humbled by the Congress party led by Sheila Dikshit.

 Agriculture ministry officials met today to discuss the situation and reports indicate they toyed with the option of an export ban. Officials put up a brave front and a government spokesperson said cryptically: Stocks are adequate in most states and will be augmented once the new crop starts reaching the mandis.

 However, retail prices in Mumbai have already crossed Rs 16 a kilo and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar is believed to have ordered his officials to be alert.

 To make things worse, both Pakistan and Bangladesh are already in the throes of an onion shortage and have been importing large stocks from India. However, government figures seem to indicate there have been lower exports during the last month compared to the same period in the previous year.

 Onion stocks held mostly by private traders are down to 3 lakh tonnes, causing alarm as the country consumes about 5,000 tonnes a day. The Nashik-based National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation says it expects total output for the year to be about 59.4 lakh tonne.

 The new crop of onion would arrive in the market only in mid-November?. Till then the prices may rise, hence the need to take measures, explained an official of the consumer affairs department, monitors the market prices of most commodities.

 Officials fear that traders may try to take advantage of the situation and hike prices further. Our efforts will be to see to it they do not?. We will be taking a number of measures soon, said an official.

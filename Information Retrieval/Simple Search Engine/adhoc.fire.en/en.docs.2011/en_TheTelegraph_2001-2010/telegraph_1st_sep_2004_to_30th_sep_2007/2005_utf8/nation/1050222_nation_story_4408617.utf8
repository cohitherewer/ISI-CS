 Narayanan ?pushed hard? on UN turf

 K.P. NAYAR 

 New York, Feb. 21: Newly-appointed national security adviser M.K. Narayanan used his foray into international diplomacy to lend muscle to what is being done here at the UN to secure a permanent seat for India in the Security Council by January 1, 2006.

 Narayanan this year replaced the familiar figure of Brajesh Mishra at the annual conference on security policy in Munich, a signal event that brings global players on defence and national security to the Bavarian city each February.

 Narayanan?s presence in Munich was an indication that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would not restrict him, as J.N. Dixit?s successor, to matters of intelligence or domestic security.

 In Munich last fortnight, together with Tatsuo Arima, special representative of Japan?s Prime Minister, Narayanan ?pushed hard? ? according to diplomats who attended the event ? to make the case why their two countries should get permanent seats with veto power in the Security Council.

 Germany, as host of the conference, laid the groundwork for their UN-related diplomacy.

 Narayanan?s maiden speech to an overseas audience in his new job was fundamentally different from that of Mishra, the NDA government?s national security adviser: it showed how far India had moved along the road as a global player since 1998, when the nuclear tests nearly ostracised it from international dialogue on security.

 ?There is already a view that the imbalance in the current composition of the Security Council is making the Council decisions more difficult for many countries to accept and implement,? Narayanan told the conference.

 ?An expansion in membership should entail an increase in the existing categories viz. permanent and non-permanent membership and inclusion of developing countries as full permanent members in an expanded council.?

 Mishra, who was the first Indian official to be invited to the conference, which has been held in Munich since 1962, was primarily defending Pokhran II at that time.

 But he also said in February 1999: ?During this conference, I got the impression that the West wants to replace the UN with Nato, that the West believes that Nato can solve all global security problems.?

 India?s subsequent presentations in Munich have dealt with New Delhi?s perspective on Russia, peace and stability in Asia and global terrorism.

 The idea that permanent membership of the Security Council was within New Delhi?s reach then seemed like a fairytale although India soldiered on towards that objective.

 In yet another demonstration that the pressures to agree to the nuclear monopoly of the big powers was way behind, Narayanan was forthright on India?s nuclear policy. 

 ?The challenge posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction still represents today a threat of the very first magnitude,? he said. ?India has consistently held that the only way to completely eliminate the threat arising from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is through multilaterally negotiated, universal and non-discriminatory disarmament instruments.?

 Setting the record straight after external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh?s confusing statement recently in Seoul virtually expressing regret for the Pokhran II tests, Narayanan said: ?The nuclear tests of May 1998 are not contrary to India?s commitment to this long-held objective. We in India believe, furthermore, that nuclear disarmament cannot be viewed piecemeal in terms of geographical extent.?

 It was left to Japan to be more blunt, even demanding on Security Council reform. Arima said: ?No taxation without representation.?

 Japan, he pointed out, contributed ?about 20 per cent of the whole volume of the overseas development assistance in the world in the past 10 years?.

 In the first official acknowledgement that a permanent seat in the Security Council is within New Delhi?s grasp by January 1, 2006, Narayanan said: ?India sincerely hopes that the 60th session of the UN General Assembly will mark a watershed in the history of the UN, heralding its rebirth as an institution in which its members again repose their faith as well as their aspirations. 

 ?In the coming months... India is ready to contribute to this global discourse on the...need for an urgently reformed and restructured UN.?

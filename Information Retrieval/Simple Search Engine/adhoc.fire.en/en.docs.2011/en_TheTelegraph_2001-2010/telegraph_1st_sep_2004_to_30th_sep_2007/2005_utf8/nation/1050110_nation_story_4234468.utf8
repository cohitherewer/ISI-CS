 Islands on guard for sea surge

 Port Blair, Jan. 9: A day before an expected surge in water level around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the chief of a defence survey team confirmed the level has risen in the south and is low in the north.

 Commodore V.K. Bhansali?s team was appointed by the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) in Delhi to survey the tsunami-triggered damage across the islands and present its recommendations.

 In anticipation of a surge, as feared on new moon night tomorrow, the administration has mapped the vulnerable areas of the islands.

 Lt Gen. B.S. Thakur, vice-chairman, Integrated Relief Command, said the ?vulnerability map?, marking the danger zones in red, will be made available to people so that they do not panic. ?The administration will warn people in advance if needed. There is no reason to panic,? he said here. Officials have been posted to monitor the rise in water levels.

 The administration has not pressed the panic button but is on alert following the met department?s predictions of a 0.3-metre rise in the sea between January 10 and 12, reports PTI. Met sources said the sea surge would be on the higher side from 8-10 pm on January 11 and 9-11 pm the next day.

 Oceanographers had earlier said the water level would rise from below the port wharf (end of land at the harbour) to 2.4 metres above on January 11 during high tide.

 Commodore Bhansali said there will have to be another survey in the long run to modify naval routes.

 The survey team?s report to IDS chief Vice-Admiral Raman Puri will include suggestions not only on relief and rehabilitation measures but also on how to minimise losses and improve reaction time in a future disaster.

 The team, including two officers each from the army, navy and air force, since January 3 has covered Car Nicobar, Campbell Bay, Katchal, Teressa, Nancowrie, Land Fall, Diglipur, Havelock, Rangat and Mayabunder.

 ?Reconstruction cannot be rushed. It has to be very deliberate and planned,? Commodore Bhansali said.

 The team, for instance, will recommend long-term reconstruction on higher ground as it found that habitations nearest to the shore were the worst hit and those higher up were better off in terms of loss to life and property. Similarly, roads running along the islands? periphery were found badly damaged, indicating the importance of lateral roads.

 The Campbell Bay base, Commodore Bhansali said, was saved from severe damage because of a breakwater. In its absence, the coastline and jetties were badly hit.

 The team will recommend portable and prefabricated cabins for temporary shelter. Studies of houses in the Pacific-rim countries, which face natural forces of this kind, could be useful, Bhansali suggested.

 This, he said, would be in addition to having IIT Chennai work on the matter, as it is doing now. The houses would have to be built to withstand quakes and the force of water.

 The team will also recommend greater tapping of natural springs and making rainwater harvesting a norm as wells in some areas have become contaminated with seawater.

 Non-conventional energy sources like wind, sun and waves could be harnessed to counteract the threat to electricity supply, according to the team. Also, the islands would have to be equipped with satellite phones to ensure uninterrupted communication.

 As relief and rehabilitation continued, Lt General Thakur stressed that the ?search for survivors is still on?. The number of bodies disposed of rose to 1,310 and that of the missing to 5,544.

 Lieutenant-Governor Ramchandra Ganesh Khapse announced shelter for all those in the relief camps ? 37,449 people ? by the monsoons. He met tribal leaders, who expressed their wish to continue living in their island of origin but agreed to shift to higher ground.

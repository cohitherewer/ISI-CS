 NDA no-trust threat to Somnath

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, March 11: The NDA has threatened to move a no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee for suggesting that a presidential reference be made to the Supreme Court following a ruling to advance the Jharkhand trust vote.

 The motion will be the first of its kind if the NDA goes ahead with its threat.

 The BJP-led coalition is planning to keep the heat on the UPA by meeting President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to apprise him of the Speaker?s ?unconstitutional? behaviour.

 The alliance might also get its leader Arjun Munda to move a contempt petition in the apex court against the Jharkhand Assembly?s pro tem Speaker for ?repeatedly referring to Chatterjee?s statement? and demand that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chatterjee make statements in the House.

 With the Ranchi tug-of-war raging on, the NDA has met twice under the chairmanship of BJP president L.K. Advani. But the ?strategy sessions? were also meant to be demonstrations of solidarity after the BJP found itself isolated at an all-party meeting convened yesterday by the Speaker. 

 The BJP?s representatives walked out after presenting their case while partners, including its most steadfast ally, the Janata Dal (United), stayed on. They lent their voice to the dominant opinion that the jurisdictions of the judiciary and legislature, as spelt out by the Constitution, should be respected.

 To belie the perception that there are cracks in the NDA, the meeting passed a resolution that went half-way to enshrine the allies? viewpoint while retaining the core thrust of the BJP?s stand. 

 ?The NDA believes that both the legislature and the judiciary are supreme in their own fields,? it said, echoing Chatterjee. 

 ?However, the ultimate supremacy is of the Constitution. Both must subserve the purpose and goals enshrined in the Constitution. The role of the central government, the UPA, the governor and the pro tem Speaker of the Jharkhand Assembly is extremely disturbing,? the resolution added.

 Endorsed by all NDA allies, the resolution said the Constitution envisages majority rule. It accused the Centre, the governor and the pro tem Speaker of ?conspiring to ignore the principle? by keeping Shibu Soren in office.

 BJP sources said the party is ?divided? on moving the no-confidence motion although the ?hardliners? and some NDA allies are ?all for it?. 

 A section of the party believes the motion would be tantamount to a no-trust vote against the UPA government and re-unite the ruling coalition as even Congress-baiters like the Samajwadi Party would support Chatterjee given their proximity to the Left. ?The mood is 50-50,? said a BJP leader.

 The flip view is that such a move would mobilise ?public? opinion against the Speaker for ?over-reaching? his brief.

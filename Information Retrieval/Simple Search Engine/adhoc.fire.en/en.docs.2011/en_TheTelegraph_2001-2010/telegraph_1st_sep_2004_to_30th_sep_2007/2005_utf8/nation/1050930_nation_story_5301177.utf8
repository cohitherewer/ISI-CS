 New Delhi, Sept. 29: Left trade unions today said their nationwide strike was the biggest ever action in recent times against the Centres liberalisation policies.

 Later, at a joint news conference, labour leaders warned the government of more hard-hitting action if it does not roll back its privatisation drive. The response to the strike has been beyond our expectations, said Citu president M.K. Pandhe.

 We have never had this kind of support in the oil sector before, said Aituc general secretary Gurudas Das Gupta.

 The CPI leader added that if the government does not yield to our demands, there will be a larger strike and for longer duration.

 According to trade union leaders, nearly six crore workers and employees from the organised and the unorganised sectors across the country participated in the strike.

 Seven central trade unions had organised the strike, while Intuc, which is affiliated to the Congress, and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-backed BMS did not take part.

 We will soon chalk out a further action plan. We hope the UPA government will take note of the discontent among workers and take immediate action, said Pandhe, also a CPM politburo member.

 He was among the leaders who criticised Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during the partys politburo and central committee meetings in Delhi last month for sending out an unqualified message that the CPM was ready to change with the world. Change is good but it should not go against our basic principles, he had said then.

 At the news conference, the labour leaders slammed the Congress-led government for treading the same economic path as the BJP-led NDA, its predecessor. We had hoped that the UPA government will follow a different path. But it is following the same poli- cies, Pandhe said. The UPA is in fact pursuing some reforms more vigorously than the NDA, said Das Gupta. 

 The leaders asked the Centre to read the writing on the wall and change its policies.

 The CPM and CPI brass and their trade union leaders are, however, talking in different tones. While Pandhe is thundering against the Centres economic policies, his partys central leadership last month gave Bhattacharjee the green signal to pursue reforms.

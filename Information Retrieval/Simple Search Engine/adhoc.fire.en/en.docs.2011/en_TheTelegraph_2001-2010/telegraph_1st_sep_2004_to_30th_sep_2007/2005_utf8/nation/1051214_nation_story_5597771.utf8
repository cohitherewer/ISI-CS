 Expressway heat on Gowda

 New Delhi, Dec. 13 (PTI): The promoter of the Rs 2,250-crore Bangalore-Mysore expressway project today alleged before the Supreme Court that H.D. Deve Gowda and his son H.D. Revanna, a minister in the Karnataka cabinet, were trying to scuttle it for political reasons.

 All sorts of trouble were being brought about on the company which was unable to execute the project, a bench of Justices Ruma Pal, Arijit Passayat and B.N. Srikrishna was told by senior advocate Dushyant Dave, who appeared for the promoter, Nandi Infrastructure Construction Enterprises (NICE).

 The company said the Karnataka government till now has not rescinded the 1997 agreement for execution of the project.

 The counsel claimed that former Prime Minister Deve Gowda had written to his son, the PWD and energy minister, against the project and a review panel was formed. 

 The committee said the company should not ask for 2,450 acres of surplus land.

 NICE contended that these lands were required for developing a township and providing interconnectivity.

 Dave alleged that Deve Gowda was trying to scuttle every project and referred to the resignation of Infosys chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy from the committee on the construction of the Bangalore international airport.

 However, senior advocate Anil Divan, who appeared for the state government, objected to the allegation, saying Dave was going beyond the case.

 An industries association supported NICE and submitted that several projects are pending since 1992. 

 The father and son cannot stop the projects, said its counsel, senior advocate Mukul Rohtagi.

 Divan told the apex court that the government was in favour of the execution of the project if NICE did not ask for 2,450 acres of surplus land.

 The court today permitted the promoter to sell and mortgage land in its possession for the execution of the project but said any such act would be subject to the outcome of the appeals pending before it. 

 The case will be heard again on January 10.

 The Supreme Court clarified that the prima facie issues raised in the appeals were considered by the orders passed by a division bench of Karnataka High Court in 1998 and affirmed by the apex court in 1999.

 The high court had quashed the government order constituting the review committee to probe whether irregularities had taken place in allotment of land for the NICE project.

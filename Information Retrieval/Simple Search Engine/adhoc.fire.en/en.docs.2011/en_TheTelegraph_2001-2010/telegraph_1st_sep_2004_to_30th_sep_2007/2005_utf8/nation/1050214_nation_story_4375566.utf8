 Geelani mum

 New Delhi, Feb. 13 (PTI): For the second day in a row, Delhi University lecturer S.A.R. Geelani, who was acquitted in the Parliament attack case, today refused to speak to police probing the last week?s murder attempt on him. 

 A team of Delhi police has also gone to Jammu and Kashmir to investigate the possibility of Geelani?s co-accused in the Parliament attack case, Mohammed Afjal and Shaukat Hussain Guru, who were awarded the death sentence, having a role in the attack on the House.

 The police yesterday recovered Geelani?s blood-stained sweater from his house in Zakir Nagar in south Delhi, about 15 km from the alleged spot of attack, outside his lawyer Nandita Haksar?s residence in Vasant Enclave.

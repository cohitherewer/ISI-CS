 Minister skids on country roads

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh was perhaps expecting too much from the public works department.

 He monitored state PWDs for quality and excellence and the results were predictable. In the ministrys own estimation, 30 per cent rural roads constructed by the PWDs are sub-standard.

 The ministry has installed a three-tier system of quality monitors on roads being built under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna.

 The first level, said joint secretary (connectivity) J. K. Mahapatra, is monitoring what field engineers and implementing agencies do.

 The ministry has formulated a standard for measuring quality. Engineers in the field and implementing agencies have to conduct inspections and submit reports in accordance with the ministrys standard of quality.

 The second set of monitors operates at the level of the state. These are independent professionals who inspect the sites periodically and give their detailed opinions, said Mahapatra.

 The third level is the national quality monitors, a group of about 150 professionals comprising engineers and experts from the Central Road Research Institute.

 In their latest assessment report to the ministry, the national quality monitors have painted a dismal picture. Of 16,569 road projects under construction, over 4,756 are unsatisfactory.

 The situation in Singhs state, Bihar, is very grim. Of 411 projects that are under way, over 141 are sub-standard.

 In the category of completed projects, 35 of 80 are less than satisfactory. The only place where roads are good is RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddins constituency, Siwan.

 Singh is, however, unfazed by criticism. 

 Instead of being rapped over the reports of the quality monitors, he feels he should be patted for instilling a sense of pride and excellence in the PWDs.

 Who has got the roads surveyed? It is not some outside agency telling us we havent done well. It is our own process of self-assessment. We are being honest about what were doing and we want some accountability.

 What is wrong with that? You cant change everything overnight. We are at least trying, he said.

 His officials agree. This is the first time any public work is being assessed so minutely by independent professionals, one said.

 Even if you give me four points on a scale of 10 this time, I would say that it was worth doing this exercise. Our achievement is that we have been able to make the state PWDs aware of concepts like quality and excellence in public works.

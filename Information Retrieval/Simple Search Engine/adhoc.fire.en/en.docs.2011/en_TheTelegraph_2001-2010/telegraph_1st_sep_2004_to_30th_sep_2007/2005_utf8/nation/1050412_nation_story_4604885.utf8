The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Groomed in silent valley 

 GAUTAM SARKAR

 Batiya valley (Jamui), April 11: ?Listen, the day is not far when people will stop electing their representatives. President?s rule in Bihar is a pointer to that. It is the ideal time to penetrate deep into society,? a tall uniformed man says calmly, addressing a group of about three-dozen youths in the picturesque Batiya valley.

 ?Carefully note down the problems people face in your respective areas and find out who are responsible for them,? he carries on.

 The youths, including 15 women, listen with rapt attention sitting next to their firearms.

 A couple of girls get up and clean the lanterns while another adds dry uradh leaves to the bonfire to keep mosquitoes at bay.

 This is no ordinary village school but a training camp with a difference. The armed youths are neo-Maoists and the men in olive green uniforms seasoned Naxalites. 

 ?We are giving the youths, who are either illiterate or not able to continue studies, an idea of contemporary society and politics. Such sessions are essential as they need to identify their class enemy and understand the motto of our organisation?, says a Maoist.

 He adds that the youths have received arms training and participated in some operations. ?Some girls arrived here on Wednesday from Simultala, where an arms training camp was conducted,? he says. 

 The topography of rural pockets like Batiya ? dense forest cover and hilly terrain ? have became ideal spots for the Maoists to conduct training camps. ?We often hear shots from the dense forest on the hills. Woodcutters who venture into the forest have witnessed uniformed men practise shooting,? residents of Jhumraj Sthan, a nearby village, say. 

 The youths at the camp appear calm and composed, dressed in simple outfits. ?We can answer all your questions,? a girl at the camp comes forward, weapon in hand. A compatriot joins her. 

 They train their guns on a couple of candles and open fire. The candles remain in place, but the flames disappear.

 ?We can conduct our training camps in this district because the place is safe and the local people support us,? points out ?Netaji,? the camp leader. 

 Jamui district, he feels, presents a picture of acute poverty and public misery. ?The people here are angry with the rotten system and the apathy of the state. They supported us when we approached them and decided to fight for their cause,? the unassuming man says.

 ?Vendors and tribals are regularly assaulted by the GRP jawans on trains. In 2003, we had to teach Simultala police a lesson for their denial to accept the complaints of some local people,? ?Netaji? says. 

 He adds, ?The villagers do not provide us shelter to avoid police harassment. But they help us in other ways. For example, they have got us food tonight.?

 Security shield for Bihar

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: The Central Reserve Police Force presence in Bihar will go up eightfold during the elections to tackle the Naxalite threat and party goons.

 The Union home ministry, advised by the Election Commission, will send 160 more CRPF companies, reinforcing the 24 already in the state. With each company made up of 120 men, more than 22,000 personnel will be protecting the polling stations from rebel attacks, rigging and booth-capturing.

 We have already ordered 65 companies to move to Bihar. By September 15, they will be in command (of security) at all the 61 constituencies going to the polls in the first phase (on October 18), director-general (CRPF) J.K. Sinha said.

 Intelligence reports say the main threat comes from the Maoists, who are already on a high after blowing apart a mine-proof vehicle (MPV) in Chhattisgarh, killing 25 CRPF personnel, home ministry sources said. 

 The Naxalites are expected to target Bihar during the elections.

 The first and third phases of the election will provide the security forces with their toughest test, because many of the 133 constituencies going to the polls in these two phases are Naxalite strongholds.

 Although the CRPF is short of manpower with a large number of its personnel deployed in Jammu and Kashmir, the Northeast and the nine Naxalite-hit states, officers said that all companies will be at their posts in Bihar when the polls start on October 18.

 The paramilitary forces will work under the supervision of poll observers and will be directly monitored by the commission. They will man 57,363 booths, including 7,300 auxiliary booths, which are being set up for the states 52.4 million voters.

 The forces will have an added responsibility, that of ensuring that the weaker sections ? especially the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ? can vote freely.

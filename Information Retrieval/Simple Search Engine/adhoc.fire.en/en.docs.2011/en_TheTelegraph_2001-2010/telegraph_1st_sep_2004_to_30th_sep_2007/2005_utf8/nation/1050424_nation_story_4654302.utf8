 Tibetan nun in rape cry

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Shimla, April 23: A Tibetan nun has complained that she was raped in Dharamsala on April 15. 

 The victim, a 37-year-old, who was purchasing fruits, was allegedly raped inside the shop by the vendor.

 Residents were shocked as the alleged crime was the first such incident since the Dalai Lama made this Himachal Pradesh town his capital-in-exile.

 The police said the nun, a Tibetan refugee, had lodged a complaint saying she was raped by an Indian youth. Kamal Chand, the officer on the case, said the nun alleged in the complaint lodged ?with the Dharamsala police on April 20? that ?she was raped by Yatin Kumar alias Riki?. 

 Yatin is absconding, but the police have arrested his accomplice ? a servant who is alleged to have helped him commit the crime. ?Yatin Kumar is missing, but we have arrested his servant (Susheel Kumar) for questioning. Apparently, he helped him carry out the crime,? Chand said on phone from Dharamsala. 

 The incident in this refugee town, the seat of the Dalai Lama for over four decades, came to light on Friday. 

 There has been stray violence between local people and the Tibetans in the past, but no such incident has been reported since the alleged rape became known. 

 Sources said the nun had arrived in Dharamsala from Tibet barely three months ago and was staying at the Tibetan refugee centre. ?As she speaks only Tibetan, she was accompanied by others when the complaint was lodged five days after the alleged incident took place,? the police officer said.

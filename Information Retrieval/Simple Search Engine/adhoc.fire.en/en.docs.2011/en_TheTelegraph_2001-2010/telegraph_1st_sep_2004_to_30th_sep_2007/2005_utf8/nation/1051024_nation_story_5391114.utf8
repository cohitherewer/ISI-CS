 Damages hope for 84 riot displaced

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 23: Sikh families that suffered no casualties or damage to property but were forced to flee their homes during the 1984 pogrom may yet receive compensation.

 The two committees set up on August 13 to take a fresh look at the compensation and rehabilitation due to victims of the anti-Sikh riots are likely to submit their reports this week.

 The committees ? set up by the Union home ministry after the Nanavati Commission report on the violence caused an uproar in Parliament ? had been given two months to hand in their reports.

 One of them, headed by the secretary (border management), D.K. Sankaran, is likely to suggest that families that were not attacked but had to flee their homes after making distress sale of their properties, too, be compensated.

 Sources said the committee has asked the riot-affected states to provide a list of such families. This has, however, proved difficult and the committee may propose that fresh claims be invited through a public notification.

 The Sankaran committee was asked to decide if current levels of relief and rehabilitation for the riot victims were good enough and to work out details of additional relief in the form of livelihood support.

 The panel is likely to recommend paramilitary jobs for relatives of those killed. The governments of states affected by the riots may also be requested to provide jobs, sources said.

 The other committee, headed by the special secretary in the home ministry, K.P. Singh, has already prepared its report on whether the compensations paid by the states to the next of kin of those killed were uniform and whether they were enough.

 The commission is likely to ask the Centre to raise the compensations substantially ? up to 25 times in some instances ? and make them uniform. In Delhi, following a high court order, the next of kin of those killed were paid Rs 3.5 lakh while the amounts were as meagre as Rs 5,000 in some states.

 Almost 3,500 Sikhs were massacred in the riot, 2,733 of them in Delhi alone. Some 250 were killed in Uttar Pradesh and the rest in Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and some other places. Thousands were injured and lost their properties.

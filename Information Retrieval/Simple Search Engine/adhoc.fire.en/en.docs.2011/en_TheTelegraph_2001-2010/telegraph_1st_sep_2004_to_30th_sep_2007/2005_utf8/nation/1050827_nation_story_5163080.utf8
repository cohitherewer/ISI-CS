 Wife fights case, PC in dock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nalini

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: The Central Board of Direct Taxes today rushed to bail out P. Chidambaram as the BJP gunned for his scalp, saying he had no knowledge it had appointed his wife counsel in an income-tax department case.

 BJP spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said there was no logic in the argument that the finance minister did not know Nalini was fighting the case. If they are husband and wife, how is it that he does not know about it? she asked, pushing for his resignation.

 Sushma said once Chidambaram takes oath as a minister, it becomes an issue of propriety. Rajiv Pratap Rudys wife had been working with Air India too, she said, but had proceeded on leave when he became civil aviation minister.

 It is a very serious issue. It is not only a case of impropriety but also corruption, favouritism and nepotism. I am surprised the Prime Minister has not taken any action after the issue was raised in the Rajya Sabha, she said.

 The controversy was kicked off by ADMK Rajya Sabha member N. Jothi who accused Chidambaram of misuse of office by having his wife appointed special counsel for the income-tax department.

 Jothi alleged Chidambaram had managed to get the CBDT and his wife to make vague statements as his role in the controversy was very fishy.

 I have submitted all the relevant documents. Why is the FM shying away from clarifying his stand? Who is he trying to fool by saying he didnt know about his wifes appearance in CBDT cases? she asked over phone from Chennai.

 Jothi argued it was a case of direct conflict of interest. Nalini maintains she was paid a very nominal sum for her work. My point is, why do they not clearly state how much money was paid? The objection is not just about money. It is a matter of propriety.

 An official statement said Nalini had been persuaded to take up the case ? Chidambaram had given it up after becoming finance minister ? by the senior standing counsel for the Chennai income-tax department, Pushya Sitaraman.

 CBDT said it approached Nalini because of her long experience in the subject. Proposals for engagement of counsels were not submitted to the finance minister for approval, it said, and in this case too neither was the file placed before Chidambaram nor was he informed.

 In retrospect, not informing the finance minister was a lapse on the part of the board, the statement said.

 Nalini, a senior advocate of Madras High Court, told the press in Chennai her husband had no idea she had taken up the case. She had been persuaded by Sitaraman, she said. 

 Out of a sense of obligation to a sister lawyer, I accepted the brief. I did not charge a fee for every hearing, Nalini said.

 I received a modest consolidated fee for settling the pleading and submissions, conference and hearings. This is the sole case in which the department had engaged me.

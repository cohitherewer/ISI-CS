 PM shrugs off letter

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today shrugged off Opposition threats of a privilege motion against him ahead of Monday?s budget, saying his letter to Sonia Gandhi regarding some proposals did not amount to parliamentary impropriety.

 ?What is breach of privilege? These are all discussions within the government system outlining government?s thinking (on the budget) without revealing anything substantial,? Singh said about his written response to Sonia?s January 14 letter that contained proposals for inclusion in the United Progressive Alliance government?s second budget.

 ?No impropriety has been committed? as he had not divulged any substantive aspects of the budget, the Prime Minister added.

 Sonia, in her capacity as chairperson of the National Advisory Council, had suggested that the budget should propose an expanded public health mission to bring the urban poor within its purview, a non-lapsable fund where money collected from the education cess could be deposited and a Rs 2,450-crore road package for the Northeast. In his reply, Singh had responded to each of the proposals.

 Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said Singh committed a breach of privilege. ?There is a practice in Parliament that anything in the budget cannot be made public before being presented in the House. What has happened is a clear case of impropriety,? the former finance minister said.

 National Democratic Alliance leaders are scheduled to meet on Monday morning, before the budget is presented, to work out a strategy on the issue and their stated intention to table a privilege motion against the Prime Minister.

 Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma defended Singh, saying there was nothing unusual in the consultations between the Prime Minister and the National Advisory Council. ?The National Advisory Council is part of the government...? he asserted. The council, he added, ?is an official body? set up to oversee the implementation of the common minimum programme the ruling coalition had adopted as the official agenda of the government.

 Sharma said Sinha should know better the process of extensive pre-budget consultations with various sections of society. As finance minister, he himself had ?written to business leaders on which of their suggest ions were accepted?, he added.

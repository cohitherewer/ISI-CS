 Chandigarh, June 17: Mansur Ali Khan Pataudis anticipatory bail plea in the black buck poaching case has been junked.

 I am sorry, gentlemen. Petition dismissed, ruled Punjab and Haryana High Court today after a four-and-a-half-hour hearing in which a battery of lawyers marshalled by the former cricketer displayed their skills.

 Pataudi and seven others were booked under the wildlife act after carcasses of a black buck and two rabbits were discovered in their vehicle at Jhajjar, 65 km from Delhi, during a routine police check on June 3.

 The former cricketer, who has thrice missed the deadline for showing up before Haryana police, had specially roped in Punjab advocate-general and renowned criminal lawyer R.S. Cheema for todays hearing.

 But Cheemas skills, combined with those of Supreme Court advocate Dinesh Mathur, Anand Chhibbar and other lawyers, proved inadequate to convince vacation judge Rajive Bhalla.

 In contrast, Haryana was represented by a sole assistant advocate-general, fanning whispers that the state was dragging its feet. The state was helped by a spirit, if not God. They could have deputed at least an additional advocate-general, said a lawyer.

 The government came in for flak from the judge, too, for having failed to track down Pataudi and the other accused. What sort of a state government is this? he asked.

 Pataudis lawyers argued no purpose would be served by arresting their client. They also questioned the power of the police to probe the case.

 They (police) made no recoveries after they arrested Madan Singh, another accused. In fact, he is now on regular bail. The applicants were allegedly caught on June 3 along with the carcasses.

 They cooperated with the police and were let off. Unless there is something new to be recovered, custodial interrogation will serve no purpose except bring bad name to these people, Cheema said.

 Mathur questioned the legality of the supplementary disclosure statement filed by the police on June 6 as well as the statement of Madan Singh, a co-accused, who claimed Pataudi had fired at the black buck.

 Haryana counsel Ajay Gulati argued Pataudi had skipped three police deadlines. Custodial interrogation is necessary to know more about the case, including ownership of the seized (carcasses) and the gun used.

 Despite the verdict, fingers remained pointed at the state. Animal rights activist Naresh Kadyan, who dug up the carcasses and took them for post-mortem to Delhi zoo on June 5, said: The government and the police are going all out to allow Pataudi and Shashi Singh (an accused) to stay out of lock-up. Im not sure what turn the investigations will take even now.

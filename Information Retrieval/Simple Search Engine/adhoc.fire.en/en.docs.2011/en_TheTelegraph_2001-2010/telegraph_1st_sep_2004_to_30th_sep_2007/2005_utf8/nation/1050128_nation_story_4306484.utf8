 ?Notice? glare on junior seer

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chengalpattu (Tamil Nadu), Jan. 27: A meeting between Jayendra Saraswati and the murdered Shankar Raman today leapt out of the prosecution?s arsenal to turn the glare on the Kanchi acharya?s ?poisonous successor?, whose request for bail was turned down by a sessions court.

 Principal sessions judge J.M. Akbar Ali referred to the meeting in Nazarethpet, not far away from Kancheepuram, as he dismissed Vijayendra Saraswati?s plea in the murder case. ?There is prima facie evidence? of this meeting when the mutt dissenter, who was killed on September 3, ?had shown more resentment towards the activities of the junior acharya, his brother Raghu, and the mutt?s manager, Sundaresa Iyer?, the judge said.

 Shankar Raman?s ?final notice urges for the removal of the poisonous successor and the contents if proved will be more damaging to the junior acharya than to the senior acharya?, Akbar Ali said.

 The judge said the circumstances under which the Supreme Court had granted bail to Jayendra Saraswati were different from the ?circumstances involving the petitioner (Vijayendra Saraswati)? at this stage. So the junior pontiff ?cannot claim parity with the senior?.

 Akbar Ali said the case diary, documents and statements of witnesses, including the kingpin of the killer gang and Chennai-based builder Ravi Subramaniam who has turned approver, revealed that both seers had ?full knowledge? of the mutt?s day-to-day affairs.

 He cited earlier judgments by higher courts to show that ?special facts and circumstances? of each case ?govern the exercise of judicial discretion for granting or cancelling bail?. When a person is accused of such a grave offence such as this, he added, ?the court has to keep in mind the interest of the prosecution and of the near and dear ones of the victim?.

 ?When saints and godmen are under a cloud of suspicion, the equality before the law does not vary from person to person,? Akbar Ali said. ?Even Sita had to enter into fire to prove her chastity. This court believes that Sita alone can emerge unscathed.? The judge also dismissed the bail pleas of Raghu and Iyer, both of whom have been charged under the Goondas Act.

 While dismissing Vijayendra Saraswati?s bail plea, Akbar Ali said Madras High Court had ?refused to grant bail? to the controversial Swami Premananda and Father John Joseph, who ran a diocese in Kanyakumari district. The former was accused of ?raping? 15 girls in his ashram in Tamil Nadu and of conspiring to murder a male inmate, while Joseph was charged with conspiracy to murder one Gilbert Raj.

 and attempt to rape a minor girl. He was also found to have ?habitual sexual intercourse? with unmarried sisters in the diocese, the judge added.

 In both these cases, the high court considered the gravity of the circumstances, the position and status of the accused and the likelihood of influencing witnesses, Akbar Ali said. The ?facts and circumstances? of the Shankar Raman case is ?similar? to the above cases, he said, pointing out that the 35-year-old Vijayendra Saraswati, being the junior pontiff of a ?renowned mutt?, wielded considerable influence over the witnesses, many of whom ?are either employees or devotees of the mutt?.

 The Kanchi Mutt suffered another setback when Madras High Court stayed the National Human Rights Commission?s notice seeking an explanation from the Tamil Nadu government on rights violations during the January 10 arrest of the junior pontiff in the middle of a puja.

 The state government, which had challenged the notice, told the court that the mutt was not a place of public or private worship, as claimed, and there was no sanctum sanctorum. It was only a dwelling place and a ?residential colony? for 25 families, the government said.

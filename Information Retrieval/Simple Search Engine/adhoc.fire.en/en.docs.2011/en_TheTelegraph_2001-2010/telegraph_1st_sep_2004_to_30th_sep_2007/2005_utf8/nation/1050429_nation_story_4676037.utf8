 Kalam hope after attack

 Patna, April 28: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has been presented with a difficult choice by a Bihar couple. 

 In a tragic but melodramatic missive to the President, the couple has sought his permission to end their lives or provide assistance to live on. ?Jeene ka upay ya marne ki izazat,? is how Anita, in her late twenties, has put it in the appeal sent to Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Both Anita and her husband, Rajiv Mishra (35), have lost one of their lower limbs when a bunch of criminals attacked them with bombs on April 8, after they protested eve-teasing by the gang. Both lie in adjacent cabins in the Patna Medical College Hospital, where they may have to stay for a long time and undergo another operation. 

 ?The President, we believe, is a kind and sensitive person who lends his ears to cries of suffering. He is also fond of children. So, we have drawn his attention to our plight,? says Anita, who is worried about the future of their only child, two-and-a-half-year-old Tanaya. The child?s future haunts her more than the spectre of a crippled life.

 Offers of help and sympathy for the couple have, however, poured in after a local cable channel highlighted their plight. ?A school student called on us today with a bouquet and an envelope that contained Rs 101,? recalled Rajiv with moist eyes. ?I accepted the one rupee coin and returned the rest to him so that he buys a book for himself.?

 Several other offers for monetary help have been made, they concede. But what they really need and are looking for is a secure future. Rajiv, a graduate, was a self-employed person who had launched a coaching centre in Vaishali. The centre is already on the verge of closure and he doubts if he will ever be able to start the operation all over again. A permanent job with the government is what would set his mind at rest, he says.

 He had named five local criminals in his statement to the police. But while the police have registered a case against all of them, except one, they all remain absconding.

 Apprehending them is a difficult task, conceded Nikhil Kumar, officer-in-charge of the Bhagvanpur police station. While speaking to The Telegraph, he said: ?They are not just a few hooligans but I have to take on an entire mafia patronised by a notorious politician with criminal record.?

 The couple is, however, grateful to Kumar who rushed them to Patna and possibly saved their lives. Others were too scared to come to their rescue and left them bleeding for 45 minutes till, finally, the police arrived.

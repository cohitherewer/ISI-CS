 Yadav punch for Yadav

 KAY BENEDICT 

 Patna, Feb. 1: The alpha Yadav is facing a challenge, from two other Yadavs. 

 Pappu Yadav, angry over refusal of tickets to his supporters, today announced he has quit the Rashtriya Janata Dal to teach Laloo Prasad a lesson. 

 The other Yadav targeting the ?Y? in Laloo Prasad?s successful ?MY? (Muslim-Yadav) combination is the Samajwadi Party?s Dadan Pehalwan. 

 But Laloo Prasad seems to have found an unwitting ally in the Supreme Court, which refused bail to Pappu, lodged in Patna?s Beur jail, and crippled his striking power in several north Bihar constituencies where muscle and clout matter. 

 Now, Pappu and his wife, also an MP, are trying to incite Laloo Prasad?s supporters to damage the RJD?s prospects. 

 Sources in the RJD said they are trying to whip up sympathy, claiming he has been denied bail though many other criminals have walked free. ?(The) Sankaracharya was given bail, but not Pappu,? argued one of his supporters. 

 The seeds of discontent were sown when Laloo Prasad rebuffed his demand for 52 seats. Pappu had deputed his father to meet the RJD chief, who apparently rebuked him for demanding so many seats and refused to give a single ticket. 

 The sources said Pappu?s enmity could have cost Laloo Prasad dear, but for the apex court order. ?If he was outside jail, he could have created havoc by setting up rebels against the RJD,? said RJD MP Mangni Lal Mandal. 

 Pappu wields much influence in Madhepura, Purnea, Saharsa, his wife?s seat, Mithilanchal and Kosi, and supporters in his constituency have vowed to work against RJD nominees in the district. 

 Not as potent as Pappu, but a threat all the same is Pehalwan, who is contesting from Dumaraon in Buxar and Bikramganj in Rohtas. His wife is in the fray from Jagdishpur in Bhojpur. The couple claims they could affect 22 seats in these districts. 

 Pehalwan has been running a strong campaign against Laloo Prasad?s family favours. ?This elections, Laloo gave tickets to 20 family members. Next election, he will give tickets to 200 of his kin,? is his refrain at every rally.

 Water woes: A woman wades through a flooded Mumbai street

 Mumbai, Aug. 10: After the disaster, the precaution.

 Growing public opinion today prodded the Maharashtra government to announce steps to prevent a repeat of the situation after the July 26 deluge that left over a thousand people dead.

 The government said it would set up a disaster management authority and another that would be responsible for the protection of the Mithi river whose thoughtless obstruction by development is said to be the single biggest reason for the flash floods.

 Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said he would take charge of both the bodies.

 The Mithi River Development and Protection Authority would look into ways to restore the natural flow of the river, which runs through the city from Powai in the east to Mahim Bay in the western suburbs. It flows through all the areas that have reported the worst devastation and number of deaths in the city.

 The Mithi development authority will take steps like de-silting the riverbed and removing encroachments along the 15-km stretch of the river.

 Deshmukh said the disaster management authority would be a nine-member body. Besides the chief minister, it would include deputy chief minister R.R. Patil and the relief and rehabilitation minister.

 The government would introduce a legislation to formulate guidelines for disaster management in the state during the winter session of the state legislature, Deshmukh said.

 The government also said it would set up a three-member panel to probe the reasons behind the floods. The committee would submit a report within three months.

 The announcements came on a day a top Left leader slammed the government for being slow to take up relief measures in Mumbai.

 The urgency (required in relief works) is not seen on the ground. The government is complacent and unless they step in, the city faces the danger of landing in an epidemic, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said at the end of a daylong tour of Mumbais flood-hit areas.

 The day also saw the dispute between Maharashtra and Karnataka over release of water from the Almatti dam snowball, with the former saying it would file a formal complaint with the Central Water Tribunal.

 Deshmukh said Karnataka released less water from the dam, compounding the floods in Sangli and Kolhapur districts due to the backwater build up.

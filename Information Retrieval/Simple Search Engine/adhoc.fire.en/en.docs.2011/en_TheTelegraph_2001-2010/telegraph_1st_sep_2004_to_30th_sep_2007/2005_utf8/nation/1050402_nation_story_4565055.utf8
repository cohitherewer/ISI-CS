 Naveen scheme to save babies

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 1: the Orissa government today launched Navajyoti, a Centre-assisted scheme, to tackle neo-natal mortality.

 The scheme, launched by chief minister Naveen Patnaik on the occasion of the state?s Foundation Day, would involve women?s self-help groups for its proper implementation.

 Orissa enjoyed the dubious distinction of having the highest infant mortality rate in the country, prompting the government to set up an Infant Mortality Reduction Mission four years ago. 

 The IMR in the state was 95 per 1,000 live births during the launch of the mission in 2000. 

 The government intends to bring down IMR from the present level of 87 per 1,000 live births to the national average of 60 within two years.

 The scheme would be implemented in 14 districts with IMR above the state average. These districts are Rayagada, Malkangiri, Nuapada, Navrangpur, Kalahandi, Koraput, Sundargarh, Keonjhar, Kandhamal, Bolangir, Boudh, Gajapati, Deogarh and Sonepur.

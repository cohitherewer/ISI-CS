 Research plan blow 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: A committee set up by the human resource development ministry has recommended a ban on further recruitment of research scholars under the University Grants Commission?s Research Scientists Scheme.

 ?Further recruitment under the research scientists scheme should be discontinued forthwith,? said the panel of experts, headed by C.N.R. Rao of IIT Kanpur. However, scientists working at present under the scheme will not be affected. 

 The scheme was launched in 1983 with the perception that India could emerge as a research hub. It was felt that foreign countries wanted to use the country for outsourcing research work. So, a research scheme would help create the right academic atmosphere, it was felt. The scheme started with 200 scholars, 100 each for science and humanities. 

 Over the years, however, it was felt that the UGC was using the scheme arbitrarily. Since 1995, no new scientist has joined the scheme.

 SC pulls up J amp;K chief secretary

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday 

 upbraided the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir for trying 

 to avoid appearing in a contempt case hearing in the Jammu 

 and Kashmir High Court, scheduled for April 7, reports our 

 legal correspondent. 

 The chief secretary had approached the apex court seeking exemption from personal appearance on that day in view of his ?official commitment? to be present for the flagging-off of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service.

 The officer faces a charge of contempt before the high court for allegedly not complying with its orders on a power project.

 An apex court bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur said ,under the contempt notice, the officer was to appear in person and asked why he was ?shying away? from personal appearance.

 ?Does he (the chief secretary) want to create an impression that courts cannot issue any direction to the officers?? the bench asked.

 The apex court observed that this was not an ?isolated? case . Non-compliance of court orders and directions by various government officers ?has become a normal practice?, the apex court said.

 Andhra MLAs take a break

 Hyderabad: Legislators of Andhra Pradesh 

 enjoyed a night out on the penultimate day of the budget 

 session of the state Assembly, reports our special correspondent.

 They danced, play-acted and cracked jokes on each other. The cultural event on Wednesday continued through the night after a late start because the legislators were busy with the business of the state, with the Assembly passing the appropriation bill after a nine-hour debate.

 While the Telugu Desam Party stayed away from the show but for participation by a few of its legislators, the Left and BJP legislators were present in full strength.

 The highlight of the evening was a ballet on the girl child choreographed by legislator Padmaja Reddy. The transport minister, Santosh Reddy of the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, had penned the script.

 There was a magic show as well, during which Legislators Narasyan Swam and Christine Lazarus produced a portrait of chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy from an apparently empty basket. 

 A legislator came dressed at the event as Mother Teresa while another had donned the form of Ravana.

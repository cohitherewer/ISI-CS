 Tremors travel as far as Saarc

 PRANAY SHARMA 

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: After concerns over law and order in Bangladesh, the sacking of the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in Nepal has darkened the cloud over the Saarc summit in Dhaka, scheduled for February 6 and 7. 

 Serious doubts are being voiced whether the summit would have to be postponed again. It was supposed to have been held in early January, but the tsunami tragedy pushed it back. 

 When Saarc officials met to draw up the agenda, the Nepalese were present. After today?s developments, a clear signal will come from the kingdom tomorrow when the foreign secretaries of all the seven member countries are expected to arrive in Dhaka. 

 If King Gyanendra decides to attend the summit, it will put his neighbours, particularly India, in an embarrassing position. Delhi would have to make it clear that unless democracy is restored, the king would not be acceptable at the summit. On the other hand, if Gyanendra doesn?t face much protest, he will force India and the others to willy-nilly grant legitimacy to Deuba?s sacking. 

 Before Nepal happened, India was worried about law and order in Bangladesh and sent a team of security experts today to Dhaka for an assessment.

 Political disturbance has surged after a blast on January 27 in the northeastern district of Habibganj killed five members of the Opposition Awami League. Former finance minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria, his nephew and three others died after an attack on a rally. 

 Reports said the situation forced a Tata team to exit in a hurry on Friday, leaving incomplete a feasibility study of the group?s $2-billion proposed investment, the biggest ever in Bangladesh. 

 The team left a day after it arrived for a study of its plans to set up power, steel and fertiliser plants, the Bangladeshi Board of Investment officials said today. ?This is very shocking for us, but the situation is beyond our control,? board chairman Mahmudur Rahman was quoted as saying. 

 However, a Tata spokesperson said in Mumbai that the group was committed to the project and was ?carrying out the feasibility study uninterrupted?. 

 The Awami League and other parties have launched a hartal which, they said, will continue to hold on February 5, when the Saarc heads of government are expected to arrive. The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party seems to be going all out to hold the summit, a feat that will help it win a major political battle at home and also some diplomatic brownie points. 

 The Awami League is trying equally hard to disrupt the summit or at least create enough noise to focus the attention of the regional leaders on deteriorating law and order. 

 Nepal has added a new uncertainty. The Saarc charter says a summit can be held only if all seven heads of government are present. 

 Gyanendra might decide to attend if he is confident. The other members could interpret it as an attempt at forcing their hand. In the scenario, India could begin a move ? camouflaged by getting Bhutan or some other country to raise their voice first ?to object to Gyanendra?s presence.

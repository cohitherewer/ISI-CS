 Centre set to blink on Bhel

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, July 6: The Manmohan Singh government seems ready to blink first in the battle with the Left over the planned divestment in Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel).

 There are indications that the Centre will keep on hold its decision to offload 10 per cent shares in the public sector undertaking. 

 The Left parties are to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and ruling alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Sunday to try and break the deadlock over Bhel, but will discuss the matter first at their own co-ordination committee meeting on Saturday.

 But, sources said, with finance minister P. Chidambaram having made up his mind to defer the divestment, the Centre is likely to hand over a note on the subject to the Left leaders before their co-ordination panel meeting.

 Some Left leaders are, however, annoyed with the government not only for what they see as its violation of the common minimum programme (CMP) over Bhel, but also for its injection of ambiguity into the document.

 These leaders feel that the document needs to be redrafted as there is some confusion in the mind of the government, as proved by its use of wrong terminology.

 The Centre has sought to make a distinction between privatisation and divestment. It has argued that even if it sells 10 per cent of its shares in Bhel, the company will continue to be a government undertaking. But the Left argues that there is no guarantee that a future government will not sell off the shares.

 While there is no mention of divestment in the document, there is mention of privatisation.

 CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said his party was clear in its mind about the terminology of privatisation and divestment.

 They are synonymous, he said. Did he want the terms redefined?

 Let the government come out with a proposal, he said. We will deliberate on it.

 The CMP is very clear on the navratnas. Bhel is navratna number one, a Left source said. He quoted the document: The UPA will retain existing navratna companies in the public sector while these companies raise resources from the capital market.

 While every effort will be made to modernise and restructure sick public sector companies and revive sick industry, chronically loss-making companies will either be sold off, or closed, after all workers have got their legitimate dues and compensation. 

 Bhel, however, is not a loss-making company.

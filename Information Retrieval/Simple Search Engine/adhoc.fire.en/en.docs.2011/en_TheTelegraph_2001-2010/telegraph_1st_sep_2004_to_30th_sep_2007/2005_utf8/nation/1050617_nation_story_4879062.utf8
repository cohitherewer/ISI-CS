 Delhi, Advani in step on Islamabad

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, June 16: Leader of Opposition L.K. Advanis visit to Pakistan had been fully supported and endorsed by Indias high commissioner in Islamabad, Shiv Shankar Menon, who was involved in the detailed planning of the visit for longer than six months.

 Menons intense involvement in preparations for Advanis trip underlined New Delhis view that it was a visit by the leader of Opposition, who has the rank of a cabinet minister, rather than by the chief of the main Opposition party.

 Menon was regularly in contact with Advani and with Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein, former Prime Minister and president of the Pakistan Muslim League (Qaid-e-Azam), the man mainly responsible for the invitation to Advani.

 Hussein is known as the kingmaker of Pakistan politics and is the most powerful civilian politician today.

 The ministry of external affairs gave political clearance for the trip and the Indian government sent an advance party to Pakistan to work out every minute detail of the visit, a practice reserved only for official trips abroad by the Prime Minister and the President.

 Sources in Pakistan told this correspondent that the security establishments in New Delhi and Islamabad gave such high priority to Advanis visit and worked jointly before and during his trip. So thorough was the security sweep that Khursheed Mehmood Kasuris house was searched before Advani arrived there for a lunch hosted by the foreign minister, Kasuri told Advani.

 Sources said Menon and Advani had at least one intellectual exchange on the legacy of the founder of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

 Advani, according to those privy to his thinking, has been engaged in assessing Jinnah for years, especially since the late Swami Ranganathanandaji, former president of the Ramakrishna Mission, discussed Jinnahs speech to the Constituent Assembly, which is now at the centre of controversy in the BJP, with Advani.

 When Advanis trip was first mooted by the Pakistanis, the idea was to build a new temple for Lav, the son of Lord Ram, who founded Lahore.

 A temple dedicated to Lav already exists in Lahore Fort and was closed by General Zia-ul-Haq for use only by police as a dungeon.

 Even a plaque mentioning the temple was removed from its site after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, but General Pervez Musharrafs government re-opened it in November last year.

 An alternative proposal was to renovate this temple.

 Throughout the stages of planning his trip, Advani kept himself briefed about the renovation plans, including discussions between Pakistani authorities and Unesco, which has shown interest in protecting it as a heritage site.

 It was at Advanis suggestion that instead of pursuing these plans, the Pakistanis agreed to a comprehensive project to restore seven temples associated with the Mahabharata.

 Advani got the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) involved in the restoration plans. If these plans go through, for the ASI, it would be a repeat of what it did for the world famous Angkor Wat temples in Cambodia.

 But in the case of temples in Pakistan, such involvement would have greater emotional and historical significance.

 The supreme irony of last weeks developments in the BJP is that Advani was at the receiving end of Hindu fundamentalist ire after doing more for his religion in Pakistan than anyone else, most of all any Pakistani, since the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state.

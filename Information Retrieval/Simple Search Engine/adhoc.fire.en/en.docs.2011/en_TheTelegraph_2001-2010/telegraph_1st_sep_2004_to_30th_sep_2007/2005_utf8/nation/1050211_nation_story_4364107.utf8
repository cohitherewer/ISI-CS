 Death for rapist of minor

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: The Supreme Court has sentenced a man to death for raping and murdering a minor, bringing the debate on capital punishment for rapists into sharp focus.

 A division bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and S.H. Kapadia delivered the judgment on Tuesday, categorising the crime as ?heinous? and ?rarest of rare?.

 The sentence comes six months after a furore over the hanging of Calcutta?s Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was accused of raping and killing a schoolgirl in a residential apartment where he was a security guard.

 Six-year-old Vishakha was on her way home from Sarvodaya Public School in a village in Uttar Pradesh on August 16, 2001, when Satish, an acquaintance, offered her a lift in his bicycle. 

 The girl?s body was found in a sugarcane field the next morning with bloodstains on her private parts and strangulation marks on her neck. 

 Satish was arrested after a witness told police that he had seen him with the girl on his cycle at 2 pm. A trial court, relying on circumstantial evidence, imposed death penalty on Satish categorising it as a rarest of rare case. However, on appeal, Allahabad High Court acquitted him. 

 The state government appealed to the Supreme Court, which set aside the high court verdict and said the ?death sentence awarded by the trial court was appropriate? and the acquittal ?clearly unsustainable?.

 Justice Passayat, writing the judgment for the bench, observed: ?The girl who had not even seen six summers in her life lost her life on account of bestial acts of the respondent Satish.? Her parents, he added, ?would have never thought in their wildest dreams that she would not come back home from school?.

 Satish, like Dhananjoy, can now appeal for clemency to the governor or the President. 

 The apex court bench said: ?Proportion between crime and punishment is a goal respected in principle and, in spite of errant notions, it remains a strong influence in the determination of sentences. Anything less than a penalty of greatest severity for any serious? is unwarranted and unwise.?

 But, it added, ?uniformly disproportionate punishment has some very undesirable consequences?. 

 Describing rape as ?one of the most depraved acts?, the judges said it becomes ?abominable when the victim is a child. The diabolic act reaches the lowest level of humanity when the rape is followed by brutal murder?.

 However, they clarified: ?Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. Death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment.?

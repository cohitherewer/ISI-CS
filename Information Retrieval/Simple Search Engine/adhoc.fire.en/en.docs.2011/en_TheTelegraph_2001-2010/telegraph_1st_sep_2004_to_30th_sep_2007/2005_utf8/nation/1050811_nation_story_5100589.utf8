 Hyderabad, Aug. 10: The countrys first rural business process outsourcing unit was unveiled today at Jalikakinada village in Andhra Pradesh.

 Promoted by Byraju Foundation of the Satyam group, the 50-seater centre was inaugurated by chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy via a video interface from Hyderabad.

 Youths from the village in West Godavari district will be taught spoken English and computer skills among other things and have been promised jobs at the centre. Some villagers have finished a two-week training with Satyam Computers and can start work right away.

 Developed under a programme called GramIT, the project is aimed at generating more wealth in villages and creating non-migratory livelihood for unemployed youths, said B. Ramalinga Raju, the chairman of Byraju Foundation.

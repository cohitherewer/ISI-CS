 Police claim lead on vicar killers

 Tezpur/Guwahati: Assam police on Sunday claimed to have identified some members of the group that killed the vicar-general of the Tezpur diocese on Friday night, but said they might take up to four more days to arrest any of the killers, reports our correspondent.

 We have identified a few persons whom we suspect are behind the killing. But we would not like to divulge their identities at this juncture, Sonitpur superintendent of police Apurba Jiban Baruah said. 

 Baruah, who rushed back to Tezpur last night from a New Delhi conference of superintendents and deputy commissioners of police, said the investigation team would require at least three more days before we can nab the culprits.

 Father Mathew Nellickal, 65, was found dead with multiple stab wounds inside a storeroom at Bishops House in Tezpur on Saturday. 

 RTDC drops outsourcing bid 

 Jaipur (PTI): The Rajasthan Tourism 

 Development Corporation has dropped the idea of outsourcing 

 some services of the Palace on Wheels to the Taj group. 

 The RTDC found the sole bid non-profit making and against the interest of the corporation, its managing director Rakesh Saini said. 

 The RTDC used to spend Rs 11,016 per week per passenger while the Taj bid crossed Rs 35,000. 

 Saini said there was no pressure from the employees union, which had gone to court on the issue.

 The move to invite outsourcing proposals had triggered a spate of protests from the RTDC employees union which threatened to stop the train, rated among the worlds most expensive luxury trains, on September 10.

 Dalits and upper caste Hindus, at least 100 CRPF personnel

 who surrendered in connection with the murder of their son-in-law,

 Singh, a senior superintendent of police posted at Rajauri,

 were booked for murdering Nitin Sharma. 

 Provogue case

 Mumbai (PTI): Police on Monday will file 

 a chargesheet against Provogue co-owner Salil Chaturvedi, 

 arrested for allegedly possessing cocaine at his house and 

 conspiring to supply drugs. Three vials of cocaine were

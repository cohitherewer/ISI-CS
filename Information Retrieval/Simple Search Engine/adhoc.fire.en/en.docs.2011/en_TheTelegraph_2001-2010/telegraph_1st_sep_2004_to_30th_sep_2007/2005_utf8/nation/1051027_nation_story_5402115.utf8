The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 At 102, grandmother of all poll wins

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Oct. 26: After 

 her election victory this afternoon, Congress candidate 

 Garetam Saraswatamma had to be virtually carried before 

 the TV cameras by her grandsons.

 At 102, Saraswatamma cant walk by herself and can hardly see two feet ahead.

 Yet she has just been voted one of the 13 directors of the primary agricultural co-operative society in Uppaluru, Krishna district.

 How would she carry out her duties? No problem, her grandsons would, as always, lend their shoulders.

 She is both a woman and a Scheduled Caste. It suited our requirements, said the co-operatives newly elected president, Congressman M.S. Krishna Rao.

 But werent there other Dalit women in the village? At least, Saraswatammas huge family of 65 could surely have provided a great-granddaughter or two?

 The 30 and odd votes the large family commands give it an edge in the village election. Having got three male members ? Saraswatammas grandsons ? elected directors, it decided the matriarch deserved a fourth spot.

 Saraswatamma is one of the numerous Congresswomen who got elected to the nearly 3,000 co-operative societies in Andhra Pradesh, the polls for which concluded today.

 Encouraged by the victories in last months local body elections, the Congress government completed the polls to the primary co-operative societies. The party bagged over 80 per cent of the societies, trouncing the Telugu Desam Party and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti.

 Saraswatamma has been a co-operative society official ? though not a director ? at least five times before. She gave up contesting some 25 years ago after breaking a leg in a fall.

 After the election results were declared, her family threw a feast for the entire village, serving Saraswatammas favourite dish, mutton pulao.

 She was carried at the head of a huge procession to the co-operative society office. The family brought along its latest member, Ganesh, Saraswatammas three-month-old great-great-grandson. The society president garlanded her.

 The victorious candidate slowly tied her unruly hair into a bun for the benefit of the cameras and straightened her saree. Asked to make the v sign, she grinned ? showing her two remaining front teeth ? and made an attempt to wave her frail arms.

 For a moment she seemed taken aback as a TV reporter asked: Are you sure you can do justice to your responsibilities at this age?

 Then the grin returned as Saraswatamma, to the cheers of granddaughters and grandsons, replied: I have done this sort of thing long ago. I am old but my grandchildren are members (of the co-operative); some of them are directors, too. They will take on my burden.

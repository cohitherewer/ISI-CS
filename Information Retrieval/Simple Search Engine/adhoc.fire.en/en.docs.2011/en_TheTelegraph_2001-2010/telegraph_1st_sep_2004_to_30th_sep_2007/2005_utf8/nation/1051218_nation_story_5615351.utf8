The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 House culprit in police sight

 Madurai, Dec. 17 (PTI): Police today claimed to have almost fixed the author of the email that threatened to blow up Parliament yesterday.

 We think we have almost fixed the author of the email, but we have to do a lot of work before we confirm it, a senior police official involved in the investigation said. 

 The email warning of blasts at US consulates in India and Parliament has been traced to a cyber cafe in the remote Murugankurichi village in Tirunelveli district in south Tamil Nadu. 

 Twelve people, including a teacher, two students and a sympathiser of militant outfit Al Ummah, have been detained. 

 A Tamil lecturer, Sindha Sait, two computer science students, Abbas and Gnaniar, and a non-teaching employee of Sathakatullah Abbas College, besides Selvin and Muthuraj, owners of two cyber cafes, have been taken into police custody, sources said.

 Four women, a mobile phone shop owner and the sympathiser of the militant outfit complete the list. 

 All those detained were being interrogated by the police and officials of the Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing, they said.

 Officials were also monitoring some cyber cafes in Salem and Erode on the suspicion that some militants might be staying in either of the towns. 

 Policemen have been deployed around the two email centres and cyber crime experts are browsing through messages sent from them. The police have also scanned their customer log books and questioned a few customers. The messages sent from nearby cafes are also being analysed. 

 The police are looking for an Al Ummah activist, Mohammed Ali, who has gone underground. They suspect that he could have instigated some persons to send the email, which also asked India to cut off relations with the US. 

 A team of the special cell of Delhi police headed for Tamil Nadu to investigate the leads in the case.

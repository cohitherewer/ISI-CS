 Riot cop firm on CD claim

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, March 4: Additional director-general of police R.B. Sreekumar has confirmed that two state officials ?tutored? him on his deposition before the Godhra inquiry commission, as purportedly revealed by an audio compact disc released yesterday.

 The CD, released by Delhi-based Tehelka weekly and aired yesterday on two private television channels, seemingly contains a dialogue between Sreekumar, G.C. Murmu, the home secretary, and Arvind Pandya, the state counsel.

 This is supposed to have occurred in Murmu?s office on August 25, five days before the police officer?s deposition before the Nanavati Shah Commission probing the 2002 Gujarat riots.

 Sreekumar, who was recently superceded, is purportedly told by the state officials not to contradict the stand of the government, which maintains that the Godhra train attack is a conspiracy.

 Murmu refused to comment on the issue but Pandya denied the charge. He said he was only preparing the police officer to face the panel.

 ?The intention was to prepare him. It is permissible. We never wanted to tutor him,? Pandya claimed and said Sreekumar appeared to have misunderstood the instructions.

 ?But now that he is saying what he is saying, we will deal with him legally,? the counsel warned.

 Sreekumar, however, said that he was told what to tell the commission and when to be evasive while answering questions. His brief, he said, was to tell the commission that the Godhra incident was a conspiracy.

 Goa waits for defector duel

 FREDERICK NORONHA

 Panaji, May 16: The June 2 byelections to five Assembly seats in Goa could see a topsy-turvy line-up.

 The candidates who won these constituencies for the BJP last time are likely to figure on the Congress list. The BJP, left without strong contenders, is looking to wean away disgruntled hopefuls from Congress ranks.

 The bypolls, whose results could break the deadlock in the 40-member Assembly and end Presidents rule, look more and more likely to become a duel of defectors.

 These five seats fell vacant when their holders dramatically quit the Assembly together ? to sidestep the anti-defection law ? leading to the collapse of Manohar Parrikars BJP government and later to Presidents rule. 

 The BJPs embarrassment is most acute in the commercial capital of Margao, where its former number two, deputy chief minister Digambar Kamat, quit the Assembly and is now expected to contest the seat on a Congress ticket.

 But Parrikars party could spring some surprises by playing on the ambitions of those Congress members who feel short-changed as their party prepares to field the returning prodigals. The Congresss ride to power in Delhi last year has fuelled the ambition of many state leaders, kicking off a bout of infighting in the party.

 Prominent Congress members in its former stronghold of Salcete have been battling each other for some time. The controversial state Congress president, Luizinho Faleiro, has been sacked and is expected to be replaced soon by another controversial former chief minister, Ravi Naik.

 Former Congress state chief Nirmala Sawant, a loyalist with a fairly clean reputation, has said she might quit the party and contest the Cumbharjua seat as an Independent.

 The BJP would love to fish in these troubled waters. 

 Some BJP leaders have, however, been pushing for candidates from the lower rungs of the party, citing how it has suffered by picking some highly controversial politicians over the past four years or so. But the central leadership has made it clear that winnability is important.

 The BJP has stayed close to the seat of power in Goa since 1999. First it shored up a government of Congress dissidents; then it toppled that ministry to come to power itself ? by encouraging defections from the government and from its own smaller allies.

 Shifting loyalties dominate the scene in other parties, too. The Nationalist Congress Party, for whom the Congress has decided to leave the Benaulim seat in the bypolls, is led by three-time Congress chief minister Dr Wilfred de Souza. Benaulim MLA Mickky Pacheco, who once backed the BJP, has now joined the NCP.

 The other seats going to the polls are Cumbarjua, Poinguinim, Taleigao and Margao.

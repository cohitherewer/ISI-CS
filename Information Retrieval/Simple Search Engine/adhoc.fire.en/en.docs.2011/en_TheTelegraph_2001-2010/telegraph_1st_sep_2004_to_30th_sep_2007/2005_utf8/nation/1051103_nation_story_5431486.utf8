 New Delhi, Nov. 2: The new chief justice of India is against the government assuming the powers to appoint or transfer judges or the Lok Pal holding inquiries against them.

 Asserting that such a move would be an infringement on the independence of judiciary, Justice Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal today said he wanted anyone to first prove corruption in the higher judiciary, then appropriate action would be taken in accordance with the (established) in-house procedure.

 The chief justice, sworn in yesterday, spoke to The Telegraph on issues ranging from pending cases, delay in delivering justice, public interest litigations (PILs), corruption in the judiciary and accountability of judges, including the CJI. He stressed the present in-house procedure was the best.

 Currently, the seniormost judge of the Supreme Court automatically becomes the chief justice who, along with five other senior judges of the court, forms the collegium that recommends candidates to be appointed as judges.

 A high courts judges are chosen by the collegium along with the high courts chief justice. The collegium also hears complaints against judges and decides their transfers and promotions.

 There is no data or some sort of a scientific analysis to say this much percentage of corruption prevails in judiciary. My learned predecessor, Justice Lahoti, has also tried to assess it, but there is no data or record or evidence to show that this or that judge is corrupt. If you prove, with evidence, then certainly action would be taken against the judge concerned, he said.

 Justice Sabharwal was against bringing the Prime Minister, President and the chief justice of India under the Lok Pal, allowing complaints against them to be probed by people inferior in rank to them.

 If you do not believe or have faith in at least the three high constitutional offices of the country, then what else would happen in this country? Who else would you repose faith on?

 He also asked: Who will then inquire into that Lok Pals activities... corruption or nepotism or any commissions and omissions? However, it is for the legislature to enact a law and if it is bad in the touchstone of the Constitution, then the judiciarys function is to strike it down.

 The government is set to table a National Judicial Council Bill during the winter session of Parliament to make judges accountable. It is also seeking to bring the judiciary under the ambit of the Lok Pal inquiries.

 The chief justice said, (lack of) enforcement of law, ad-hocism and lack of discipline were the three major ailments afflicting the system today and the judiciary was, after all, part of the system.

 But, he said, no new law is needed to speed up pending cases: the judges themselves can set a time-frame for finishing arguments, filing written submissions, furnishing evidence and its examination. 

 To give fast and less expensive justice till the commonest of the common man in rural areas, he said, is his priority.

 He, however, said its up to Parliament to decide if the death penalty should continue; the judiciary cannot make laws.

 On PILs, the chief justice said they have done good to the country but it should be determined if these are in truth a private interest litigation or publicity litigation or blackmail litigation. The veracity of the person filing such PIL and the subject matter would determine whether the petition is genuine or fake.

 He said he would meet law minister H.R. Bhardwaj to ask about the delay in appointing judges ? there are 188 vacancies in the countrys high courts. 

 On pending cases, he said that filing of cases has also increased. He cited the instance of a Delhi magistrates court that has 5,000 cases pending. Obviously, the next date of hearing would be given after two years.

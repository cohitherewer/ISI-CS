 Ahmedabad, March 12: Following 

 in the footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi, another Gandhi went 

 on a Dandi march today to commemorate the 75th anniversary 

 of the salt satyagraha.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi led a band of 79 ? the same as the original group of satyagrahis ? on a 2-km trek from Sabarmati Ashram to the Income-Tax Chowk, where she garlanded Gandhiji?s statue before leaving for Delhi. 

 Hundreds more are expected to join the 26-day walk that will culminate in Dandi after covering a distance of 200 miles.

 In 1930, the Mahatma had marched from Sabarmati to Dandi to oppose the British government?s salt act.

 Since early this morning, Sabarmati Ashram reverberated with Gandhiji?s favourite bhajans like Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, while a crowd shouted slogans ? ?Gandhi is not only the past, he is also the future.?

 People had started gathering at the ashram even before the break of dawn. Sonia arrived at 5.45 am, and after a short speech by Congress leader Mukul Wasnik, the event kicked off with a rendition of Vande Mataram. 

 Sarod maestro Amjad Ali Khan, accompanied by his sons, played Vaishnavjan to tene re kahiye ? also among Gandhiji?s favourites.

 An hour later, the Congress president flagged off the march after administering an oath to the yatris to fight injustice, poverty and communalism. 

 The marchers included Gandhiji?s great grandson Tushar Gandhi, descendants of the 1930?s satyagrahis and freedom fighters and several Union ministers. 

 Thousands gathered to catch a glimpse of P. Chidambaram, Sunil Dutt, Mani Shankar Aiyar and Renuka Chowdhury sporting Gandhi caps and holding the Tricolour.

 Sonia was the indubitable crowd-puller as children lined the roads waving flags and shouting Vande Mataram while the elderly carried placards welcoming her.

 The foreign faces among the marchers also evinced considerable interest. Twenty-five-year-old Canadian tourist Olivier said that when he learnt about Dandi march, the first thing he did was buy Gandhiji?s autobiography. ?As I started reading the book, I got deeply interested and wanted to know more about this great man of the 20th century. So I?m here.?

 London-based Geeta Mistry is pleasantly surprised to see a packed ashram. ?Now I realise what my grandfather used to tell me about Mahatma Gandhi, the charismatic leader of India?s national movement,? said the 26-year-old management consultant, who was thrilled to meet Tushar, the co-organiser of the event.

 The Mahatma?s great grandson believes the re-enactment of the Dandi march is the mantra for communal harmony in the riot-hit Gujarat.

 As for the Congress, which has been out of power in the state for more than a decade, the event is an opportunity to rejuvenate its grassroots cadre.

 While Sonia steered clear of any political statement, ignoring provocation by BJP?s local unit, her dinner meeting with the top brass of the Gujarat Congress has not gone unnoticed.

 In Ranchi, BJP president L.K. Advani issued a statement saying that the central government had converted the anniversary into a ?purely Congress affair? and misused the occasion for the ?exclusive projection? of Sonia.

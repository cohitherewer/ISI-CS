The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Matches in a month, no news of telecast

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 28: Over a year has passed and crores have been spent on litigation; yet uncertainty still looms over the telecast of cricket played in India.

 Less than a month remains before the first one-dayer between India and Sri Lanka in Nagpur on October 25. But no one knows who will beam the next home series.

 In October last year, it was a similar situation with the India-Australia series. Nothing has changed, a sports broadcaster rued.

 The rights had then been shared by Sony and Door- darshan, after several court cases and a threat from Cricket Australia to withdraw its team if the telecast iss- ues were not sorted out before the tourists landed in India.

 But this time, with the Board of Control for Cricket in India caught in a power tussle, it seems unlikely that the Sri Lankan board will be in a position to take a similar path.

 Delhi High Court today fixed for October 4 the next hearing of Zees petition. Zee wants the BCCI tenders quashed on the ground that the terms were designed to keep it out of contention. 

 At the earlier hearing, on September 13, the cricket body had sought time, saying a decision on the tenders could only be taken by its new board after the elections in Calcutta, slated for September 22-23.

 But with the standoff over the elections forcing the BCCI to call a truce for the moment and decide to reconvene after about two months, no one knows what will happen to the telecast rights for the Sri Lankan tour.

 Zee, on a high after bagging the rights to beam all the soccer played in the country for the next 10 years, is now sending signals that it is not interested in the cricket rights.

 I hope I dont get it now, Zee chief Subhas Chandra had remarked on Monday, after the award of rights by the All India Football Federation. 

 Chandra also mentioned that people are disappointed with cricket.

 Its the right time, feels Zee, which has reportedly promised around Rs 270 crore to the football federation, to swing the spotlight away from the stumps to the goalposts.

 Theres a great soccer tradition in India, and a greater potential to turn it into a better TV spectacle, said Gary Lovejoy, chief operating officer of Zee Sports.

 Lovejoy and his team are embarking on a trip across India to take stock of the stadiums and infrastructure.

 Centre unveils 84 riots relief

 new delhi: 

 The Union cabinet on Thursday cleared a Rs 714.16-crore 

 aid package for victims of the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 without 

 making any changes to the proposal sent to it by the home 

 ministry, reports our special correspondent. 

 The Centre will give an ex gratia payment of Rs 3.5 lakh for each death in addition to what has been paid by state governments, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.

 Payment in cases of injury would be Rs 1.25 lakh, but after deducting the amount already paid according to relevant court judgments. The package covers rehabilitation of survivors of the carnage that broke out after the assassination of Indira Gandhi.

 According to sources, the cabinet did not increase the package because of financial constraints. 

 The announcement evoked mixed reactions from the Sikh community with some praising the governments generosity and hundreds blocking roads at West Delhis Tilak Vihar, a rehabilitation colony. They announced a march to the Prime Ministers residence on Friday. 

 Nod to Rajiv killers daughter

 Chennai (PTI): 

 Arithra, the daughter of Nalini and Murugan, both convicted 

 in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has been allowed 

 to visit her parents in a Vellore prison in Tamil Nadu.

 The external affairs ministry has sent a letter informing the Indian high commission in Colombo about the Centres decision, official and police sources said.

 However, 14-year-old Arithra, who stays with Murugans mother in Sri Lanka, is yet to get a visa, which was expected to take some more time, the sources added.

 While Nalinis death sentence has been commuted to life imprisonment, Murugans mercy petition is pending with the President.

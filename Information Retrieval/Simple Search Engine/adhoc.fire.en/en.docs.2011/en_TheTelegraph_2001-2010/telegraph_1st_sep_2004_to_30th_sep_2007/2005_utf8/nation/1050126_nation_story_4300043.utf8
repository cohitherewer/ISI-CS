 Cong takes it easy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: Confident about wresting power in Haryana and Jharkhand, the Congress has decided to field its star campaigner sparingly in the two states.

 Sonia Gandhi is expected to be in Haryana just days before the fortnight-long campaign ends on February 1. Sources said she would hit the trail on Friday and might do another round on Saturday.

 The relaxed approach is in contrast to the Congress chief?s intensive ?jan sampark? campaign in the state before last year?s parliamentary elections when she covered nearly 1,000 kilometres. 

 ?She would certainly not be undertaking a jan sampark abhiyan in the state. Maybe, she might address a few public meetings later this week,? a party functionary said.

 Congress poll managers reckon the party is poised for a landslide victory in Haryana, where elections to all 90 Assembly seats will be held on February 3.

 In Jharkhand, indications are Sonia will campaign for just a day for the first phase of polling on February 3. Sources said she might address campaign meetings in the state, as well as in Bihar, on January 31. In the first phase, half a dozen party candidates are in the fray in Jharkhand while 18 are in the running in Bihar.

 In Bihar, Sonia would only canvass for party candidates because of the ambiguous nature of ties with Laloo Prasad Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal and Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, general secretary Ambika Soni said.

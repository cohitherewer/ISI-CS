 New Delhi, June 12: The home ministry has shot down the recommendation of a group of ministers to issue work permits to illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, according to sources.

 The unanimous view was that it is impossible to give work permits to Bangladeshis as they are illegal immigrants and it would set a bad precedent, said a top-level official after an internal meeting last week where the suggestion was rejected.

 There could even be serious political and legal fallout if the recommendation is accepted and work permits are issued, the official added.

 Sources said the home ministry has decided to move the Supreme Court following Delhi High Courts dismissal of the Centres application seeking to modify its action plan for the deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.

 The high court had termed as absurd the Centres proposal that it draw up a revised action plan after consultations with the Bangladesh government. The court said the government, under the pretext of modifying the plan, was delaying the process and directed it to implement the action plan of 2002, according to which 100 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants have to be identified every day.

 There is no option but to go to the apex court as it is virtually impossible to separate Bangladeshis from the lot belonging to Bengal, Bihar and Assam. Most of them have changed their identities. They have Hindu names and have even got ration cards. Many of them have picked up Bihari and dialects of West Bengal and some do not even speak their language at all. Finding them is like finding a needle in a haystack. States like Bengal are also not ready to help by sending teams to identify Bangladeshis, said an official.

 Officials concede that even after identifying the immigrants, deportation is impossible. It is a no-win situation at the border. The Border Security Force pushes them into Bangladesh while the Bangladesh Rifles sends them back to Indian territory at gunpoint. 

 The home ministry is going to take up this issue at the home secretary-level talks with Bangladesh in August, said a source.

 Another worry for the Centre is the increasing pressure from the northeastern states on the deportation issue. According to a source, several states have resented the suspension of fencing along the border as well as erection of the fence 150 yards inside Indian territory.

 Most MPs and MLAs of these states want the fence to be built on the zero line. A delegation of legislators from Tripura last week told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil that 14 towns, including the capital Agartala, would lose large tracts of land if the fence is constructed 150 yards inside Indian territory.

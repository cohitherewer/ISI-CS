 Mayavati on Delhi warpath

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mayavati: Stung

 Lucknow, May 11: Mayavatis anger at the CBI questioning her in an assets case today snowballed into a threat for the UPA as she declared she would withdraw support to it if the Congress continued to watch her humiliation in silence.

 We have given support to the UPA government from outside. If (the) Congress does not issue (a) clarification on the way the CBI is using discriminatory policies, we will be forced to reconsider support to the Centre, she said.

 The CBI had questioned her in a disproportionate assets case at her Delhi residence yesterday.

 Dubbing the CBI a Manuwadi (casteist) organisation, the Bahujan Samaj Party leader alleged it was carrying out a systematic campaign to malign her. It had clubbed her relatives assets with hers and foisted the case on her, she claimed.

 In that case, the CBI should use the same yardstick and immediately start assets cases against presidents of all parties taking into account their properties and that acquired by their relatives, Mayavati said.

 But no such thing would be done, she said. In this country, there is one law but it is enforced differently for Dalits and differently for Manuwadis, she alleged.

 Mayavati claimed she was a classic example of this discrimination. In the Taj corridor case, I face two cases (one corruption case and one assets case), but the rest of the accused persons are booked in just one case.

 Recently, she had got a reprieve in the Taj corridor case when attorney-general Milon Banerjee observed she could not be tried in the case.

 Mayavati then took a swipe at the CBI. They call it (the Taj corridor case) a Rs 175-crore scam. But the fact is the government did not release more than Rs 17 crore, she alleged, adding she was being harassed because she was a Dalit.

 As Mayavati ranted against the Congress for not reining in the CBI, her supporters said the party had let the agency loose on her because she had refused to tie up with it for the panchayat elections.

 Uttar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Singh denied his party had anything to do with the CBI inquiries.

 The Congress has no connection with the cases being faced by former chief minister Mayavati. The party had no role either when attorney-general Milon Banerjee told the Supreme Court she could not be tried in the Taj corridor case, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No Oriya, please: Youre in Orissa 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, May 25: Come July, Oriya and several subjects will not be taught in several colleges across Orissa.

 The official reason: these subjects find few takers.

 The list of institutes includes some of the most well-known colleges of the state.

 So, Ravenshaw College in Cuttack, the oldest in the state, will not offer courses in Oriya, Bengali and Urdu in degree classes from the next academic session. Similarly, GM College, Sambalpur, will stop teaching mathematics. 

 Oriya will be scrapped from 14 other government and 125 aided colleges at the degree level. Balasore towns Fakir Mohan College ? named after Fakir Mohan Senapati, the first Oriya short story writer ? will also shed the language. 

 The higher education department is understood to have taken the decision on the basis of students enrolment in the past three academic years. 

 As part of its bid to reform the higher education system and rationalise the student-teacher ratio, the department has directed 32 government and 207 aided degree colleges not to teach subjects which have a dismal enrolment rate.

 Economics, says the government, has lost its popularity among girls. The result: it will not be taught in government womens colleges at Puri, Jeypore, Keonjhar, Phulbani, Bhawanipatna, Aska and Dhenkanal.

 Higher education minister Sameer Dey said this has been done as part of its rationalisation process. 

 We dont want an anomalous situation where there is only one lecturer to teach just one student. Its ridiculous, he explained.

 Mathematics, too, seems to have lost its relevance as enrolment is dismal in several government colleges. The subject will be scrapped in several institutions.

 Economics, Sanskrit, Oriya and psychology will be dropped from the degree curriculum of Maharshi College of Natural Law here.

 At Kamala Nehru College, a womens college in the capital, home science and psychology will be dropped. 

 The move will not affect those degree students who are in their second or third year.

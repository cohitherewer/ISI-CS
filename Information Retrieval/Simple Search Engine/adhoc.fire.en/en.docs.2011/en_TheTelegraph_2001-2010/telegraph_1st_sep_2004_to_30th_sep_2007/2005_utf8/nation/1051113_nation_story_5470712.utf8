 Forest crawls with forces 

 NALIN VERMA

 Balmikinagar (Indo-Nepal Border), Nov. 12: Tigers are nowhere to be seen, nor is there any trace of the Naxalites who have made Balmikinagar forest in Bihars West Champaran district their home. The picturesque landscape on either side of the river Susta that divides India and Nepal is crawling with security forces who sealed the border today.

 It will stay that way till November 19, when polling concludes in Bihar, to keep Maoists out. The third phase of polling will be held tomorrow.

 Balmikinagar forest is the latest addition to areas under operation of the CPI (Maoists) active in Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. 

 The CPI (Maoists) are hand in glove with Nepal Maoists, organised under the banner of CPN, said West Champaran deputy inspector-general Arbind Pandey.

 Prachanda, the leader of the Nepal Maoists, had recently denied any armed cooperation with the Indian rebels. But top Bihar police officials said they have conclusive evidence that Nepal Maoists joined hands with the CPI (Maoists) to blow up the house of former minister Sitaram Singh and many government offices at Madhuban, a small town in East Champaran district, a couple of months ago.

 In line with the decision taken at a joint meeting at Bettiah, the district headquarters, on October 29, Delhi has deployed elite companies of Sashastra Suraksha Bal (SSB) on the northern bank of Susta while Kathmandu has deployed its army in Triveniganj and Parasa on the southern bank.

 Revealing details of the joint meeting attended by officers of border districts of the two countries, the chief district officer of Parsa in Nepal, Navin Ghimire, said the local officers would maintain perfect liaison with their counterparts. 

 Intensive and synchronised patrolling would be conducted on both sides throughout the polls. There will also be exchange of vital intelligence inputs between the local officers concerned, he said.

 Hundreds of jungle villages in Rampur, Champapur and Don areas are languishing in poverty, with no roads or civic amenities. 

 The villages along the 45 km stretch from Bagaha to Balmikinagar ? bordering Parsa, Bara and Rautahat districts in Nepal which are the nerve centre of Maoists ? are virtually inaccessible to the police and administration. 

 Police say the geographical terrain and poor condition of people have helped the Maoists.

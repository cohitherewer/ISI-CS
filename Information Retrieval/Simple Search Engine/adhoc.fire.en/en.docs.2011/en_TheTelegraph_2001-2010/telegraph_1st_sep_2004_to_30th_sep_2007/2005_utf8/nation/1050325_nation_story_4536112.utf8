 Opp. piles heat on Speaker

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 24: The Congress-led Opposition in Orissa today decided to move a resolution in the House seeking the removal of Speaker Maheswar Mohanty over his alleged misbehaviour with some MLAs.

 Yesterday, the Opposition had boycotted proceedings for the entire day after Mohanty allegedly made ?uncharitable remarks? against Congress MLA Taraprasad Bahinipati. 

 During zero hour, the Speaker reportedly did not allow Bahinipati to raise a point, which was followed a heated exchange between the two. The Opposition MLAs then staged a walkout, accusing Mohanty of ?swearing like a football player?.

 The impasse continued today with the Opposition remaining firm on its stand not to participate in the House proceedings till the Speaker tendered an unconditional apology for ?misbehaving? with its MLAs. 

 The protesting members then sought to move a resolution seeking Mohanty?s removal from the post of Speaker. However, it was rejected by deputy Speaker Prahlad Dora on the ground that the notice for such a motion needs to be served at least 14 days ahead of its discussion. 

 Since the budget session of the Assembly is scheduled to end on April 6, the mandatory 14-day period cannot be completed, Dora observed. 

 Not to be deterred, the Opposition said it would continue to boycott the Speaker.

 While the Congress, Orissa Gana Parishad, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and Independent members stayed away from the proceedings for the rest of the day, MLAs of the ruling coalition debated on the ?misconduct? of the Opposition legislators and brought a motion against Bahinipati, seeking his suspension for seven working days. Dora then suspended the Congress leader from the Assembly for the next seven days.

 Anjali Behera, Draupadi Murmu, Sanchita Mohanty and Bijaylakshmi Patnaik, MLAs of the ruling coalition, protested against the use of ?unparliamentary? language by the Opposition members.

 Mohanty, the man in the eye of the storm, maintained that he would not apologise, as he had not committed any ?crime?. The Speaker, however, admitted that he uttered some ?unwarranted? words in the House. 

 Mohanty said he committed the mistake following provocation from the Opposition, adding that the development was ?unfortunate?.

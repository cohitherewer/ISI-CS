 Fee freeze at IIMA

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 2: Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad has decided to retain last year?s fees for post-graduate programmes for the 2005 academic session. 

 ?This is the second successive year that we have not raised the fees,? said director Bakul Dholakia after a meeting of the institute?s board of governors. 

 He linked the decision of not hiking the annual fee ? Rs 1.58 lakh ? to the agreement among the six IIMs to minimise the divergence in fees.

 Human resource development minister Arjun Singh had set aside the threat of the 80 per cent fee cut ? sprung by his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi ? but asked the IIMs to move towards a common fee structure. 

 The directors of the six IIMs met to discuss the issue and decided that those charging lower fees ? like IIM Calcutta ? would gradually increase it, while those charging higher fees ? like IIM Ahmedabad and Bangalore ? would either not raise it at all or increase it at a lower rate.

 Recently, the board at IIM Calcutta decided to increase its annual fee to around Rs 1,50,000 from last years Rs 1,30,000. 

 quot;We are also developing a common framework for fee calculation in all the IIMs, quot; said Dholakia.

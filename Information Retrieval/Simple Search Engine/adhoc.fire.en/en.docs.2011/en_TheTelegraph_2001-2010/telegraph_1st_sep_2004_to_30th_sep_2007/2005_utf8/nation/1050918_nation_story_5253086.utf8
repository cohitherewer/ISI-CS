 Party upset with PM adviser

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Congresss media wing is again upset with Manmohan Singhs media adviser Sanjaya Baru ? this time over his press briefing in New York after the Prime Ministers meeting with the US President.

 The party is embarrassed that Baru shared with the media Singhs remark to George W. Bush that his predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been sharply critical of the Indo-US nuclear pact.

 The media adviser did not say anything that Vajpayee did not in his intervention in Parliament on the debate on the Indo-US nuclear cooperation agreement. But he should have avoided saying that while the Prime Ministers visit is still on, said a senior party functionary.

 Baru, the Congress leader added, should not have spoken at all. Usually, it is either the foreign secretary or the external affairs ministry spokesman who does the briefing during prime ministerial visits abroad.

 The leader also questioned the wisdom of Barus move to brief the press when the foreign secretary was going to issue an official version of the talks between Singh and Bush.

 Asked why Baru chose to brief the media, the Congress leader said: You have to ask him.

 Barus comment drew sharp criticism from the Opposition BJP and, rather surprisingly, also the CPI, an ally of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre.

 Congress sources say much of the needless controversies is because of a communication gap, which leads to confusions.

 Last May, the partys media department was furious over Barus release of the text of a speech Singh made at a closed-door meeting of the working committee. 

 It claimed that the official had not bothered to crosscheck with the party if the Prime Minister had deviated from the prepared text when he spoke at the meeting.

 Barus text, which among others mentioned that Singh gave his one-year-old government 6 out of 10, had rendered irrelevant an official briefing by media department chairperson Ambika Soni.

 Even Sonia Gandhi, who presided over that meeting, did not recall the Prime Minister saying that, said Soni, who later took up the matter with Singh.

 While Congress leaders are not too impressed with Barus style of functioning, Singh appears to have full confidence in his media adviser.

 Barely two months after the May controversy, the Prime Minister elevated Baru to the rank of secretary from the additional secretary rank he held at the time of his appointment last year.

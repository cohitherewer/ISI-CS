 Navy officer missing

 New Delhi, May 20: Naval and Coast Guard patrol vessels and aircraft are searching for a navy officer who is suspected to have fallen overboard off the coast of Visakhapatnam, reports our special correspondent.

 Sub Lieutenant Ashish Popli was on night duty on the INS Sharabh, a landing ship tank, on Tuesday night. 

 Popli was not missed at breakfast as his colleagues assumed he was resting after the night shift. The alarm was raised later when he was not found in his cabin.

 Man Overboard was reported off the coast of Kakinada on Wednesday morning.

 Coast Guard director-general A.K. Singh said all efforts are on to trace the officer.

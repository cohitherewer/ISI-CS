 Memorial missile at Maoists

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 31: Andhra Pradesh police are paying back Maoists in their own coin, or rather memorial. That too, right at the rebels doorstep.

 A massive memorial, paying homage to civilians and police personnel who have died fighting the extremists, was inaugurated yesterday in the Birpur mandal of Karimnagar district.

 The pyramid structure resembles the numerous memorials to Maoist martyrs that dot Telengana district in coastal Andhra.

 The polices memorial, named Shanti Stupam, is located in front of the home of Ganapati alias M. Lakshman Rao, the secretary of the CPI (Maoists), at his native village Sarangpur, about 5 km from Birpur town.

 With hopes of truce ebbing, the state police have launched a campaign to spread awareness on the dangers of abetting extremism. The stupam is part of this drive. 

 We want to educate the civilians against sheltering and providing food to Maoists and their responsibilities in helping the police. If not, they will meet the same fate as those killed by the Maoists in cold blood, cautioned D.S. Chauhan, the Karimnagar superintendent of police.

 Rajanna, a resident of Birpur, said extremists here have killed over 18 people in the past few years for helping the police and refusing to abide by their diktat. No one, neither Maoists nor the police, has the right to take law in their hands, he said.

 Birpurs circle inspector Narasiah said the Maoists have built four memorials in the mandal. If Maoists can build memorials for their comrades who waged an illegal war against an elected government, why cant we build one for the policemen and civilians who died while protecting democracy?

 The state police have taken their battle into the interiors of the forests peopled by the rebels. Since January, a combing operation is on in the Nallamala forests and the Dandakarnya belt. The police have found a large quantity of arms, ammunition, cash and documents in Maoist dumps across the state.

 The police-Maoist peace process, aborted since January when the rebels walked out of talks, shows no sign of revival. All the committees comprising civil rights activists and journalists have become defunct and the chief coordinator and moderator for the talks, S.R. Sankaran, appears to have no clue to what is going on.

 Civil rights activists say a political solution is not possible. I wish both the police and the Maoists would sit for talks to resolve the issues rather than the Maoists and the politicians, said the president of the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties state unit.

 The rebels, meanwhile, are continuing their campaign. The Janashakti group has called a bandh tomorrow to protest against the arrest of four key activists and the recent killing of three others in encounters in Prakasham district.

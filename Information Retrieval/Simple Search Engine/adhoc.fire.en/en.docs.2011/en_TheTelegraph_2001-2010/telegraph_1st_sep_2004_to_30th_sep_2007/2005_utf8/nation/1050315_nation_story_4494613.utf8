 Taj case red face to Centre

 Mayavati: Setback

 New Delhi, March 14: The Congress-led Union government faced another embarrassment with the Supreme Court overturning the opinion of attorney-general Milon K. Banerjee in the Rs 175-crore Taj heritage corridor case.

 This is, perhaps, the first time that the opinion of the attorney-general has been rendered redundant. 

 The Centre had earlier said the matter was referred to the attorney-general who opined that there was no case against Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayavati. The CBI had on the basis of this opinion filed a closure report in the case.

 But a bench of Justices Ruma Pal, S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia said the opinion of the Central Vigilance Commission should be obtained to close the case against the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister. 

 The court-appointed commissioner, Krishan Mahajan, on resumption of arguments today, submitted an affidavit that the CVC is the superintending authority of the probe agencies and it should have been consulted before closing the case. It argued that for the closure of this case, which has been under the CBI, the attorney-general?s opinion is irrelevant.

 The Centre had decided to close the case against Mayavati, allegedly because of the changing situation in Uttar Pradesh where the Congress is trying to rally forces against chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. Mayavati is reportedly a key factor in this endeavour.

 Mahajan argued that the apex court in its earlier direction had ?specifically designed a machinery like the CVC to ensure fair, impartial and objective functioning of the CBI?.

 The court directed that the entire CBI case file, including the case diary, be transferred to the CVC for its opinion on whether criminal prosecution should be launched against Mayavati.

 Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati argued that the matter was referred to the attorney-general as there were conflicting opinions expressed by officers within the CBI about launching prosecution on the basis of the evidence collected. The Supreme Court had in the last hearing taken serious note of the closure report. 

 The other accused are former chief secretary D.S. Bagga, Mayavati?s personal secretary P.L. Punia and state environment secretary R.K. Sharma.

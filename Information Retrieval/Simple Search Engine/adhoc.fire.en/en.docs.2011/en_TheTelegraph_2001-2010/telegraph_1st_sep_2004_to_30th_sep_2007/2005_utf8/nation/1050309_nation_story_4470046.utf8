 Bush around, no bullet-proof vests

 New Delhi, March 8: If security personnel fighting terrorists and insurgents cannot have lightweight bullet-proof jackets, blame it on George W. Bush.

 Home ministry officials have told minister Shivraj Patil that the global demand for these vests has increased phenomenally ever since the Bush administration ? criticised back home for sending soldiers to Iraq without the basic protective gear ? got manufacturers working at full capacity to meet its army?s requirements.

 ?We have been told by representatives of bullet-proof vest manufacturers that they would not be able to execute supplies in the near future due to their commitments to the US,? a home ministry official said.

 Patil had got a similar response last week while discussing the pace of the modernisation scheme for central police forces that the home ministry funds.

 It is inhuman to make the security personnel wear the traditional bullet-proof jackets, the minister is learnt to have said. The traditional vests have a steel plate that can take an AK-47 bullet shot from 10 metres but they weigh nearly 10 kg. 

 A lightweight jacket can cut down the burden by 4 kg. It has a soft armour panel and a high-performance polyethylene plate for the hard armour panel. The soft armour panel can offer protection from 9 mm pistols while the hard one can take shots from an AK-47 rifle.

 Under its modernisation plan, the home ministry had last year floated tenders for 65,000 bullet-proof vests for central police forces. ?It received a good response but the delivery time is going to be the problem,? an official said.

 Sources in the security industry said only four companies ? Honeywell, DuPont, Teijin Twaron and Dyneema ? globally produce the raw material used to manufacture bullet-proof vests. 

 ?I have contacted everyone abroad.? They say their production capacities are booked for several months,? said an industry source. ?It is going to be a monumental task for the government to get its supplies in a hurry,? he added.

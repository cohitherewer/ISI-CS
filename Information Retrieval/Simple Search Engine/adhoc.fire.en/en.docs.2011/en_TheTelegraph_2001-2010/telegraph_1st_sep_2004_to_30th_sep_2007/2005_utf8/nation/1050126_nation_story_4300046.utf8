 Kerala govt bans all lotteries

 Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): Kerala has 

 banned all lotteries, including the one run by the state 

 government, following a Supreme Court order on Monday.

 The decision comes in the wake of the apex court?s stay on the state government?s rules banning online and paper lotteries of other states.

 Addressing a news conference after a cabinet meeting here, chief minister Oommen Chandy said the government decided to stop the paper lottery run by the state as it had no other option available. The finance department has been asked to prepare a scheme to rehabilitate the lottery vendors, he added.

 Tuesday?s draw would be the last of the state lottery and the 453 employees of the lottery department would be redeployed.

 Online lottery operators had challenged the state government?s move to initiate action against them and illegal paper lotteries run by other states, while allowing the state-run lotteries to continue. The apex court had also demanded an apology from the state government for initiating action against online lotteries in disregard of the stay order issued by the apex court against such action.

 Hunt on for Patna schoolboy

 Patna: Patna police continued to hunt 

 for clues in the Kislay Kaushal abduction case while their 

 counterparts in Biharsharif were unsure if Ravi Kant was 

 abducted or was simply ?missing?, reports our correspondent. 

 ?We have registered a missing persons? case with Sohsarai police station on the basis of the statements of the boy?s parents. We are also looking into the kidnap angle and have formed a team to pursue the case. Raids are on and we have detained four persons for interrogation,? Biharsharif town deputy superintendent of police Vijay Shankar Prasad said on Tuesday.

 In Patna, senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan said they hope to rescue Kaushal soon.

 Students? protests continued for the second day today with a human chain, relay fast and prayers even as Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists took to the streets to enforce their Patna bandh, called to protest the abduction of Kaushal.

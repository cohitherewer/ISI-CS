 Widow on job hunt tortured

 VIVEK ANAND

 Dubai, Sept. 8: Six Indians have been jailed for luring a woman from Kerala to Dubai, torturing her and forcing her to become a sex slave.

 The victim, a 30-year-old widow and mother of two from Kottayam, said she had paid an agent Rs 65,000 for what she believed would be a job with a Dubai beauty parlour. 

 But she was raped, starved, beaten up and burnt with cigarette butts till she gave in to the gangs demand, sometimes entertaining up to 20 men in a single night.

 Her male tormentors ? Abubaker Abdul Rahman, Mohammed Yousef, Naykaraparambil Nasser, Mohammed J. and Nasser K. ? have been handed five-year terms while their woman accomplice, Tulsi, has got one year. All six are from Kerala.

 When the victim, a qualified beautician, landed in Dubai last October, she was received at the airport by Abubaker, who went by the name of Hassan. She was taken to a flat and raped by Hassan. 

 The woman said Hassan had trapped at least 15 to 20 other girls the same way. They were moved from one flat to another ? often from city to city in the Emirates ? after every three or four days. 

 One evening in March, she managed to escape while being moved from one flat to another. She jumped out of the car when her escorts stopped to buy something in Deira, Dubai, and shouted for help as she was being chased.

 A crowd gathered, forcing the gang to retreat. The police arrested four of the accused the same night; Hassan and Nasser K. fell into the net two days later.

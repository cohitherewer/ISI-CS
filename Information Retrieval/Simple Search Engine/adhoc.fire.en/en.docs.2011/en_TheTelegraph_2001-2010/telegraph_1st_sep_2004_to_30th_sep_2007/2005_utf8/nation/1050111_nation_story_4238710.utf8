 Cop shunt order

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: Within hours of the issue of the notification for the February 3 Assembly elections in Haryana, the Election Commission today ordered the immediate transfer of state director-general of police M.S. Malik who is known to be a confidant of chief minister Om Prakash Chautala.

 The commission directed Malik to hand over charge to the seniormost police officer in the state and asked the Chautala government to send a panel of senior police officials for deciding Malik?s successor.

 The poll panel?s move came following reports that the state government had made a large number of appointments to the police department at the level of constables in violation of the model code of conduct that came into force early in December.

 Malik, who has been the director-general of police now for more than four years, came under attack from the Opposition Congress and BJP during the parliamentary elections last year when his wife Krishna Malik entered the poll fray from the Sonepat Lok Sabha seat as a candidate of Chautala?s ruling INLD.

 Upholding the complaints that Malik was misusing his position to help his wife, the commission had asked him to go on leave until the election. Krishna lost the election to BJP?s Kishan Singh Sangwan.

 Besides ordering Malik?s transfer, the poll panel also asked the state government to immediately transfer director of public relations Rajesh Kumar Khuller and his deputy Om Parkash from their posts to ensure free and fair polls.

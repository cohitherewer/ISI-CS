 Academics raise quota questions

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: The elimination of state quotas would adversely impact poor but meritorious students, academics warned today after the Supreme Court ruled that the state cannot appropriate seats in unaided professional educational institutions.

 But some educationists also said the ruling has the potential to increase competition between educational institutions and, in the long run, enhance quality of education.

 A senior educationist said that at a time when teaching shops have been masquerading as educational institutions, concerns about quality and equitable access to education will persist. 

 Higher professional education is in need of even greater scrutiny today than earlier to ensure quality, said Anita Rampal of the department of education at Delhi University. Any change in seat quotas would need to be accompanied by regulations to check fees and admission norms. But the question of who is going to monitor academic quality and regulate fees is not clear. 

 While the number of private engineering and medical colleges has burgeoned in recent years, such colleges have two tiers of seats. Students admitted under the government quota pay lower fees than paid by students in the management quota. Educationists say the government quota might typically make up anywhere from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of total seats in a college.

 Reductions in government quota would make it difficult for poor but meritorious students to access higher education, said Bantwal Prabhu, director of the Manipal Institute of Technology in Mangalore. But the solution, he said, might lie in increasing the number of scholarships. 

 I think the industry should be tapped for scholarships ? after all, these students are going to work for the industry, he said. 

 A senior officer at the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) said removal of state-imposed quotas would facilitate free flow of students and increase competition between institutions for the best students. Overall, I think this could lead to a higher quality of education because of competition, said AICTE vice-chairman Ram Avatar Yadav.

 A senior faculty member at an educational institution in Karnataka said some private institutions have increased their intake of government students by offering a large number of seats. But a large number of seats does not ensure quality. Education is a balance between infrastructure and teachers on one side and the number of students on the other, he said.

 Institutions conscious of quality would be able to invest in infrastructure and faculty and increase quality of education, he said.

 Child killed for goddess

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 10: A 30-year-old man of Sundargarh district has sacrificed a five-year-old boy to propitiate Goddess Durga.

 Gananath Dehuri of Surjigarh village in Sundergarh called Suresh Dehury, the son of his neighbour Dambarudhar Dehury, on Sunday evening on the pretext of taking him to a Ramayan recitation ceremony. 

 The function got over at 8 pm but instead of taking back the boy back home, Gananath took him to a nearby canal outside the village, stripped him, chopped off his ring-finger and gouged out his eyes before killing him. 

 Gananath threw the boy?s finger and eyes into the water. Later, when Suresh?s parents asked him about the whereabouts of the child, he turned evasive. A search began but the boy could not be found.

 Suresh?s parents reported the matter to Koida police station the following day and Gananath was detained. He confessed to his crime during the interrogation.

 The officer-in-charge of Koida police station, Pradip Mishra, said Gananath sacrificed the boy to appease Goddess Durga. 

 ?Gananath told us that Goddess Durga had appeared in his dreams and asked him to sacrifice a minor if he wanted to be get rid of his problems,? he said. Police forwarded Gananath to a court, which later remanded him in custody.

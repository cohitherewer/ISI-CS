 No exit for Musharraf match

 Musharraf: Safety bubble

 New Delhi, April 11: Spectators will have to stay put inside Ferozeshah Kotla stadium till the Musharraf match is over.

 The home ministry has asked security agencies to throw an ?impregnable? security net around the Kotla and the VVIP enclosure that will host Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 One ground rule prevents spectators from returning if they go out. The home ministry expects this rule to keep free-loaders away.

 Police officials recalled that once inside, a spectator would collect tickets from friends and go out on one pretext or the other. The tickets ? already used once to gain entry ? would then be used by others waiting outside.

 If used as effectively as gate-crashers in Delhi have in the past, this strategy has the potential to smuggle in hundreds of people into the stadium and leave people with valid tickets out in the sun.

 That is what happened to Nau Nihal Singh and his son-in-law when they came to the Kotla to watch India and Sri Lanka play in March 1996. Singh then took the Delhi District Cricket Association to court for deficiency of service. The association was recently ordered to pay him Rs 19,000 for mental agony and harassment.

 SC lifts Kotla cloud

 The Supreme Court today rejected an application seeking a stay on the Kotla one-dayer on safety grounds. 

 The judges accepted a submission of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi that claimed the stadium was ?very, very safe?.

 Left cool to Cong in UP

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 29: Still nursing the hope of a third front, the Left does not want a Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh. 

 ?It is not in our interest to have a strong Congress in Uttar Pradesh,? said a senior Left leader.

 The CPM and the CPI, it seems, will tacitly back Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav if there is a turf battle in Uttar Pradesh ? politically the most crucial state in the Hindi heartland.

 The Left?s logic is that a weak Mulayam Singh, with either the Congress or BJP occupying centrestage, will adversely affect the prospects of a third alignment.

 The Left sees both Mulayam Singh and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav as partners in the front. It is, therefore, in the Left?s interest to see that these forces ? which at one time maintained equidistance from both the BJP and the Congress ? retain their influence in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, their respective states. 

 In 1996, Mulayam Singh and Laloo Prasad were key partners in the United Front government at the Centre. Both the Samajwadi Party and the RJD have grown at the expense of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where they have severely eroded the party?s support base among Muslims and the backward castes.

 The Congress is trying to get back to its feet in both states. Yesterday, the Congress, whose relationship with the Samajwadi Party has been uneasy, warned the Mulayam Singh government that its support was a ?one-time cheque that has been encashed and not a credit card?. Congress leaders also expressed concern over the worsening law and order in Uttar Pradesh.

 There is increasing speculation that the Congress may veer towards the Bahujan Samaj Party as an ally. But the Left seems to be putting its weight behind Mulayam Singh. The CPM has always backed the Samajwadi Party leader regardless of his attacks on the Left. CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet stood by him even when he refused to support the Left?s presidential nominee, Lakshmi Sehgal. The Samajwadi Party instead lent its might to NDA nominee A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, which led to the collapse of the People?s Front.

 The Left is aware that a realignment of these forces is not feasible at the moment and is therefore not harping on it.

 Powerless lantern shines in test paper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, April 5: Habits die hard in Bihar, or so it seems. 

 The school examination board has been running for cover after secondary school examinees faced a question asking them to identify the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s election symbol in the civics paper yesterday.

 The ?objective type? question had four choices ? lantern, hand, cycle and lotus ? all symbols of leading political parties. The matter came to light after a local paper reported it today.

 Board chairperson Rambahadur Prasad Yadav, who did not identify the person who had set the paper, said he would conduct an inquiry into the matter. The BJP today cried foul over the ?irrelevance? of the question and how it was ?inserted under political pressure?.

 But state RJD president Abdul Bari Siddiqui said his party or its leaders had nothing to do with the question. ?It is the board which sets test papers. Only the board can provide an answer. The BJP has no moral right to object since it had made fervent attempts to saffronise education,? he added. 

 An examinee said she was surprised to get the one-mark question. ?Although it was not part of our course, everyone was happy because the answer was known to all the examinees. Till recently it was the most talked about symbol ? on the streets as well as television channels. During rallies, lanterns used to be prominently displayed all over the city,? she added.

 Students of schools affiliated to the state examination board have been reading the biographies of Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi because chapters on them are part of the textbook.

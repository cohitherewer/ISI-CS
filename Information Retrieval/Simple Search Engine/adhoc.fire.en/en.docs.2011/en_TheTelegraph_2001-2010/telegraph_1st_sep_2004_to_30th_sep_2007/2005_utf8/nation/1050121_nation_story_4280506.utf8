 Andhra bandh

 Hyderabad, Jan. 20: Life came to a standstill in large parts of the Maoist dominated districts of Andhra Pradesh as the CPI (Maoist) observed a statewide bandh in protest against the killing of 12 activists and failure of the authorities to observe a ceasefire, reports our special correspondent.

 Maoist sympathisers in Siricilla town in Karimnagar district, about 210 km from Hyderabad, threw stones on the police after three Maoists were killed in pre-dawn raids.

 They gheraoed the local police station where the bodies were kept and demanded that the post-mortem be done again. Dalit organisations also staged a dharna as two of the dead Maoists were Dalits.

 Reports of arson and demonstrations were received from from Anantpur, Guntur,Mahboobnagar,Warangal and other Maoist dominated districts.

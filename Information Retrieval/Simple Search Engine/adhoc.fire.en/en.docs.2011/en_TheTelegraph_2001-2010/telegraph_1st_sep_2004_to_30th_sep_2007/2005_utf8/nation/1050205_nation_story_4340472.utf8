 PF strategy session 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: The Employees Provident Fund Board of Trustees will meet on February 20 to decide the strategy to meet the Rs 920-crore deficit incurred by the 1 percentage point hike in the provident fund interest rate. 

 Two days ago, the government hiked the interest rate from 8.5 to 9.5 per cent, incurring the huge deficit. 

 The board has two options ? either to invest 5 per cent of its funds in the stock market or to park it in postal deposits, which fetch a 12 per cent interest. 

 The interest rate was earlier slashed from 9.5 to 8.5 per cent because of inadequate returns from the special deposit scheme (SDS) where the board invests a bulk of its funds. The SDS fetches an 8 per cent interest. 

 The finance ministry has refused to increase the interest rate on SDS deposits. 

 The most tangible option is to invest the money either in stock markets or in postal deposits. 

 But while Left parties are opposed to the proposal to invest in stock markets because of the market volatility, the finance ministry feels postal deposits are meant for retail customers and not entities, institutions and organisations.

 Union labour minister K. Chadrasekhar Rao is confident the board will be able to mobilise resources without investing in stock markets.

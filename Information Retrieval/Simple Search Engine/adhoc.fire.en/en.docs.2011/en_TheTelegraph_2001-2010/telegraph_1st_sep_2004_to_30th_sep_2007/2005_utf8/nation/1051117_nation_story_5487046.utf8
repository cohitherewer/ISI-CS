 Mystery of the unseen SP

 UTTAM SENGUPTA

 Patna, Nov. 16: Suspended ostensibly for leaving his post without information, former Jehanabad superintendent of police Sunil Kumar Singh has been forced to plead his innocence through the media.

 Reports that he was actually in the state capital, visiting his family on Sunday, when Maoists conducted Operation Jailbreak have been rubbished by him as rumours planted by his detractors. The officer has claimed with some justification that he could not have possibly sneaked out of Jehanabad without a police escort and bodyguards.

 But the police headquarters in Patna continues to insist that he could not be contacted throughout Sunday and that he surfaced suddenly around midnight after the Maoists had left. 

 Singh, however, has claimed that he had returned home in the evening to find information that a large group of extremists had been spotted in a part of the district. He had immediately left for the area, the officer added. It is not clear when he returned or when he learnt of the Maoists.

 But his suspension had not been revoked till Wednesday evening, despite the minor police rebellion in Jehanabad yesterday demanding his reinstatement.

 Headquarters sources continued to insist that Singh had left his post and had returned only after he had learnt of the Maoist attack. Why else would he keep his cell phone switched off throughout Sunday? asked an official while admitting that there is unverified information that the superintendent was inside the Police Lines when the Maoists encircled it.

 That the confusion about the officers whereabouts has not been resolved even after three days speaks eloquently of the state of the administration.

 The trail of the retreating Maoists, meanwhile, has turned cold. All the numbers recorded in the cell phone recovered from an injured Maoist are pre-paid connections obtained after furnishing false addresses.

 Officials said the connections were all discarded immediately before or after the operation, a normal ploy used by Maoists.

 The rebels activate wireless sets and walkie talkies only during operations. They are switched off as soon as an operation is over, giving little time for security agencies to scan the frequencies.

 On top of that, the surveillance and communication equipment in the state, the officials said, are not powerful or sophisticated enough to scan the frequencies faster.

 The death today of the solitary surviving Maoist has also frustrated investigators. But the injured Maoist was left to lie in the open for more than 14 hours. Alive, he could have been an asset to investigators but medical facilities are primitive in both Jehanabad and Patna.

 Questions are being raised why the injured Maoist was not flown to a better-equipped hospital and earlier. But no attempt is being made to fix responsibility for the delay. 

 The only other lead left behind by the marauding Maoists was one of the half-a-dozen jeeps they had apparently used in the operation. But the retreating Maoists blew up the jeep, probably after it developed a snag.

 Raids continue in search of the weapons but the security agencies have drawn a blank so far. That is because, explain the officials, the Maoists bring in the weaponry at the last moment and take them away in vehicles before hiding them hundreds of kilometres away from the operation site. The Maoists apparently retreat in small groups and without arms.

 A senior police officer also admitted that all ranks are suspected to have been infiltrated by the Maoists. Policemen in Jehanabad, he said, are too demoralised to go after known Maoist supporters in the area. Any strong-arm tactics, they fear, would invite a reprisal.

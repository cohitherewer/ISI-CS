 Police entry bar set to be raised

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, April 20: The police system is in for a change. A matriculation certificate will no longer be enough to be eligible to police the billion-plus population. 

 A committee on police reforms, constituted on the directive of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last year, has asked the Union home ministry and state governments to raise the educational qualification for the constabulary to at least higher secondary level.

 Most states and central police bodies require applicants for a constable?s job to hold a matriculation certificate. Officials said there were exceptions to the rule. For instance, Bihar allows persons who have passed Class VIII to join as constable on normal duty while in Tripura, they are eligible for the state armed police.

 Singh had in November asked the ministry to get working on police reforms that prompted it to dig out nearly half-a-dozen reports on the subject since the 1980s.

 The committee headed by then Union home secretary Dhirendra Singh was set up to sift through the reports and identify recommendations that could be taken up on priority basis. The committee submitted its recommendations last month.

 The group of ministers on national security set up after the Kargil conflict had also recommended an overhaul of the recruitment and training procedures. 

 But the group had said the states should continue with the matriculation-level recruitment but provide an intensive two-year training to all fresh recruits that would entitle them to a higher secondary-level certificate. 

 An official said the home ministry had sent the recent report to states to begin implementation of some suggestions and build consensus within the government machinery on issues that would require legislative clearance.

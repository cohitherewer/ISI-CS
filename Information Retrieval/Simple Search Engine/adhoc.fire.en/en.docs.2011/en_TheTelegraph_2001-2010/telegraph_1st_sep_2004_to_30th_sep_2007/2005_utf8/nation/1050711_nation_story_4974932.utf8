 Seven drown in flash flood

 Nagpur (PTI): Seven persons drowned in 

 flash floods in river Ghawanda in Yavatmal district of Maharashtra 

 on Saturday. 

 The flood was triggered by a dam burst at Nandgaon that raised the river water to an unexpected level. 

 Thirteen people were swept away in the flood. While one person has been rescued, a search is on for the six missing.

 The water level started rising at 8.30 pm on Saturday and receded by midnight. About 1,000 people from over 350 shanties along the river near Mallikarjun temple were shifted to safer places and offered first-aid, food and shelter.

 The administration has announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for each of the deceased above eight years and Rs 50,000 for every child.

 English for varsity teachers

 Indore (PTI): The vice-chancellor of 

 Devi Ahilyabai Vishwa Vidyalaya, C.S. Chaddha, has introduced 

 English classes for teachers to check the declining language 

 standard in the varsity.

 The knowledge of English and Hindi of the teachers and students is very poor as there is no emphasis here on learning the correct language with proper use of grammar, Chaddha said. 

 Therefore, I have decided to start English classes for the teachers for improving their language skills so that students get benefited. The classes will commence from this academic session.

 Chaddha blamed the government policy for not making English compulsory in Madhya Pradesh.

 Rapist lover

 New Delhi (PTI): A travel agent has 

 been arrested for allegedly raping a 16-year-old.

 Jailed foreigner 

 Varanasi (PTI): A citizen of the 

 Netherlands, serving a life term for smuggling and peddling 

 drugs, has allegedly committed suicide in his prison cell.

 Chennai (PTI): Lok Sabha Speaker 

 Somnath Chatterjee has said a meeting of leaders of political 

 parties will be held on July 22 at Delhi to discuss conduct 

 of parliamentary proceedings in a peaceful and undisturbed

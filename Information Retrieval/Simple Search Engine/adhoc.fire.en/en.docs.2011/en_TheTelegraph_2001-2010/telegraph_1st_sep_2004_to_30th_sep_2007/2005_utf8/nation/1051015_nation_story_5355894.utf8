 Cop terror maims boy

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Oct. 14: It had all the makings of a heart-warming story: A teenaged boy who had fled home returning after three months, on Dussehra night aboard Sadbhavana (Harmony) Express, a gift for his parents in his pockets.

 As he rocked gently with the movements of the train, 14-year-old Chand was already dreaming about how he would bring a smile to his parents face by showing them the Rs 400 he had earned through honest toil.

 It was the money ? and two Government Railway Police (GRP) jawans greed for it ? that wrecked the dream. On board to protect passengers from criminals, the policemen snatched the money from Chand and when he tried to resist, threw him out of the running train.

 Chand, alias Muhammad Salim Ansari, who has lost a leg and suffered serious head injuries, was fighting for his life at Patna Medical College and Hospital today before the helpless gaze of his parents.

 I had earned the money by working as a tea vendor for three months. I had finished counting the notes ? about Rs 300 ? in one corner of my coach and was about to count the coins when the policemen came near me. I tried to protect the money but they kicked me and pushed me out near a railway overbridge close to Hajipur station, Chand said between clenched teeth, still writhing in pain.

 I knew my left leg had been chopped off under the train. Yet I pulled back as I saw another train pass by. I lay there for almost an hour before some people spotted me. I dont know why I didnt lose consciousness.

 The boy had fled home to escape the scolding of his parents and the monotony of village life and the lessons in the madarsa. Father Muhammad Nasim Ansari, a rickshaw-puller, and mother Zahida Khatoon ? residents of Narauli in Muzaffarpur district ? spent three months pining for their only son to return.

 I missed home very much although life outside is fun. I knew my parents were worried, said the boy, eyes firmly fixed on the father, who kept feeding him biscuits dipped in plain water.

 The railway police seem to have taken the matter seriously. We have begun a probe. The guilty will not be spared, said deputy inspector-general Subhash Chandra Sinha.

 Smooth run for Teesta

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Rambhi, May 23: After a turbulent and meandering journey through rocks and boulders right from its source in Chumthang (north Sikkim), the Teesta seems to be in for a smoother ride in this stretch for the next two-and-a-half years.

 All eyes are now set on May 30 when, as part of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC)s Teesta Low Dam Project Stage III, the course of the river will be diverted through an open-lined concrete channel, 45 km from Siliguri in West Bengal.

 The 600-metre channel will divert the river about 50 feet left of its course. The river will flow through the artificial channel for at least two-and-a-half years, during which a barrage across its dry riverbed will be constructed.

 The authorities, however, are afraid that the monsoon may play spoilsport. We will have to divert the course of the river by May 30, said chief engineer Sahadev Khatua. If the monsoon sets in earlier than usual, construction of the barrage will be delayed by six to eight months.

 At present, the Teesta flows around 50 m right of its course. It had been temporarily diverted last December. It was a temporary diversion. Diverting the river through the concrete channel is a much bigger challenge. We will be able to begin the work from September only if we are successful in diverting the Teesta, Khatua said.

 A race against time is how over 1,500 workers and engineers of NHPC describe their last moment preparation as they wait for the big day with an eye on the accumulating clouds.We have deployed 200 extra labourers in the past two months and have also brought sophisticated machines to meet the deadline, the chief engineer said.

 Stage-III of the project, estimated at over Rs 800 crore, is the first major hydel-power project on the Teesta after it enters the state and is expected to generate 132 mw of electricity. Work on the fast-track project started in last October after the forest department gave it the go-ahead in May. The project is expected to be over by March 2008. In all, 180 hectares of forest had to be cut down for it, but no eviction had to be done.

 The barrage will also have a fish ladder, which the power major will introduce at an extra Rs 6 crore. Migratory fish often use this stretch to move upstream, Khatua said.

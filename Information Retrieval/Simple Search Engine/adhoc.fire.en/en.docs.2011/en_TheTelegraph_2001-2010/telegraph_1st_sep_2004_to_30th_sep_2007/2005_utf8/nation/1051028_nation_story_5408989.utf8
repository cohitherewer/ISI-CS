 Rape cry in call centre car

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: A call centre employee and the driver of a car used as a pick-up vehicle for staff were arrested by Delhi police for allegedly raping a 25-year-old woman early today.

 Delhi police have registered a case against the employee, Ali Jafar, and the driver of the Toyota Qualis, Harish, for raping the woman in the moving car.

 According to the police, the Qualis, attached to the Gurgaon-based call centre, was dropping employees when they saw the woman standing on the road. The woman, who asked for a lift, said she wanted to go to Shahdara and the driver offered to drop her as he was headed in that direction.

 It was after dropping the others that the main accused, Jafar, allegedly raped her in the moving car. Harish also tried to assault her but the woman raised an alarm. As the car approached a flyover, a police van posted there heard her cries and gave chase, intercepted the Qualis and caught the accused.

 The police said the woman had come to Delhi recently from Maharashtra in search of a job. 

 Delhi police have come under fire for the spurt in crime against women in the city, particularly rape in moving vehicles.

 In July, a 23-year-old resident of a jhuggi in Mayapuri, in southwest Delhi, was raped in a moving car. The men drove around the city raping her. Two hours later, she was dropped off in northwest Delhi, about 15 km from where she was abducted.

 Earlier, on May 8, a college student was abducted in south Delhi and gangraped in a moving Santro. The men raped her as they drove from south to east Delhi, even changing the car in between.

 The police came under severe criticism for failing to catch the culprits immediately although the womans friend had informed them on a cellphone minutes after the kidnap.

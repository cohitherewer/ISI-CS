 Sena gets ready for Rane battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 25: Malwan is set for a showdown between the Shiv Sena and Narayan Rane, the partys former strongman who is now with the Congress. 

 Rane, who was expelled from the Sena, filed his nomination today for the byelection in this Assembly constituency.

 His former aide, Parshuram Uparkar, is the Sena candidate for the seat. He will file his nomination on Friday. The election is scheduled for November 19.

 The senior Sena leadership, including chief Bal Thackeray, son Uddhav and nephew Raj, are expected to lead the campaign in Malwan on the Konkan coast after Diwali. 

 Other Sena MPs and senior leaders have also been asked to camp there after the first week of November.

 No campaign can happen during the Diwali celebrations. So, our campaign will start gathering pace after the festival. We are still chalking out the election tours of our senior leaders, said Anil Parab, the Sena campaign manager for Malwan. 

 Parab is one of the likely candidates to be pitted against late Congress MP Sunil Dutts daughter Priya for another bypoll scheduled on the same day in North-West Mumbai.

 However, Thackeray has made it clear that the Sena is more interested in Ranes defeat than the North-West Mumbai contest. He referred to Priya as my friends daughter and hinted that the Sena would not put up a strong candidate against her.

 WWF for nature shield

 Basel (Switzerland), Jan. 9 (Reuters): Poorly planned coastal development compounded the impact of Asia?s tsunami and rebuilding efforts should use natural protection provided by reefs and forests, conservation group Worldwide Fund for Nature said today.

 In a report ahead of a United Nations meeting on the plight of small-island states, the WWF warned against over-logging and urged protection for tsunami-hit fishermen who could be pushed aside by opportunistic outside fleets.

 ?It is also vital that coastal ecosystems, such as coral reefs, mangroves, marshes and forests that buffer the impact of tsunamis are rehabilitated and restored,? the Switzerland-based WWF said in a statement.

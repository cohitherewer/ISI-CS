 Security shield for Tytler

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: The government has asked police to provide full security to Congress leaders and officials against whom the Nanavati Commission made adverse references in its report on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

 We do not want to take any chances. We have asked Delhi police and state police forces to provide full security to (Jagdish) Tytler, Sajjan Kumar and local Congress leaders H.K.L. Bhagat and Dharam Dass Shastri, the then lieutenant governor P.G. Gavai and the then police commissioner S.C. Tandon, home secretary V.K. Duggal said.

 We will be providing enhanced security cover to Justice G.T. Nanavati also, Duggal added.

 Sources said the decision to step up security has come in the wake of reports of intelligence agencies that some people related to the 1984 riots could be targeted by militant groups like the Babbar Khalsa to incite youths of a particular community.

 Asked if the security for the politicians and the others has been enhanced on the basis of the threat perception, the home secretary said this is part of a normal exercise undertaken in such cases.

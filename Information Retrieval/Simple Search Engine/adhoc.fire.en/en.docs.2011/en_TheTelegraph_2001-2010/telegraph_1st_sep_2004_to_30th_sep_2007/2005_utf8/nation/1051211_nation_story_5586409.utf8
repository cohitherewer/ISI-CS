 NRI arrested for 9/11 fund theft

 New York (PTI): A non-resident Indian 

 has been arrested on the charge of embezzling millions of 

 dollars from a fund meant to help identify victims of the 

 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.

 Prosecutors alleged that about $5.5 million had been transferred to bank accounts in India at the instance of Natarajan R. Venkataram, a former administrator in the New York city medical examiners office.

 Another former employee of the department, Rosa Abreu, was also arrested along with the 41-year-old Venkataram on Wednesday.

 Prosecutors claimed the duo had diverted millions of dollars to companies, some controlled by them or their associates, which did little or no work.

 The fund had been set up to buy computer hardware and software to help in the identification of victims.

 Rap on eye-for-eye ruling

 New York (PTI): Terming the eye-for-an-eye 

 sentence given to an Indian in Saudi Arabia as torture 

 masquerading as justice, Human Rights Watch said on 

 Saturday the punishment violated the countrys obligations 

 under international law.

 A shariat court has ruled that 33-year-old Abdul Latif Naushad, from Keralas Kollam district, should have one of his eyes gouged out as punishment for being the cause of a Saudi losing an eye during a scuffle.

 This literal eye-for-an-eye sentence is torture masquerading as justice, Joe Stork, deputy director of the US- based organisation, said. King Abdullah must prevent the imposition of corporal punishment in violation of the countrys obligations under international law.

 official car knocked down a two-wheeler, killing a woman

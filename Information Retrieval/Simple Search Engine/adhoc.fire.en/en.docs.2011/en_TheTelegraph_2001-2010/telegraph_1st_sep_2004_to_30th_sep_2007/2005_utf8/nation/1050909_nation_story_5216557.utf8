 7/7 backlash on Hindus amp; Sikhs 

 London (PTI): Faith hate crimes against 

 Hindus and Sikhs have increased sharply here since the July 

 7 bombings, more than those against Muslims, the Hindu Forum 

 of Britain has claimed.

 There have been 932 hate crimes against Indians, predominantly Hindus and Sikhs, compared with around 600 such instances against Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims, according to Ramesh Kallidai, secretary-general of the forum.

 Leaders of the forum met the assistant commissioner of the metropolitan police, Tarique Ghaffour, and spoke to him about the increased vulnerability of Hindus to faith hate crimes and expressed concern over absence of government recognition of this.

 Forum leaders said most of the crimes took place because of mistaken identity in the 7/7 backlash.

 As Asians, we all look the same and are equally vulnerable to any backlash, Kallidai said. However, our greatest concern is that there is no official recognition yet that Hindus and Sikhs are more vulnerable than the Muslim community.

 SC blow to capitals hawkers 

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has 

 refused to relax the ban on hawking in Chandni Chowk area 

 of the capital during Ramazan and Dusshera.

 The court dismissed a plea of hawkers and part-time shopkeepers to modify its earlier order declaring the stretch from Jain Mandir to Fatehpuri in New Delhi a no-hawking zone. 

 On August 25, the court had directed police to remove all hawkers and squatters from the area.

 Force jawan was killed when his ser-vice rifle accidentally

 Calcutta, Dec. 29: Universities and research institutions in Calcutta have begun taking a fresh look at security arrangements inside auditoriums that have been picked as venues for seminars and conferences during the next few weeks.

 Officials of various institutions convened emergency meetings during the day and decided to approach the state government and police to ensure tight security in all the venues, which include some hotels.

 Security measures on campuses are also under scanner. We have to draw up a comprehensive plan to tighten the security arrangements on our campus. The first round of meeting was held today and we have to organise another discussion with the departments concerned soon, Sankar Pal, the director of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), said. 

 Several seminars ? where scientists from the country as well as from abroad are expected to attend ? are scheduled to be held during the next few weeks at various institutes.

 The organisers are the ISI, the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics and Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, the Indian Association for Cultivation of Science, Calcutta University and Jadavpur University.

 The important seminars that are slated in January and February include two national-level conferences in statistical mathematics and economics of the ISI; a three-day international meet in bio-chemistry of Calcutta University; a series of national conferences in the auditorium of the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics; and a national meet of scientists at the Indian Association of Cultivation of Science.

 Yesterdays incident (in Bangalore) is shocking. We wonder how we are going to concentrate on our work during a major conference which is going to be held in the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics auditorium next month, said a teacher of Jadavpur University.

 The best brains in the field of biochemistry and related fields from all over the world will gather here between January 6 and January 9. We will discuss some burning issues during the meet. We need to have tight security on the campus on the three days, D.J. Chattopadhyay, dean of science, Calcutta University, said. 

 The conference will be held in the auditorium of the universitys Ballygunge Science College campus.

 Vageesh Mishra, the inspector-general of police, south Bengal, also expressed concern. 

 We will meet the heads of the institutions shortly and review the existing security arrangement. We may also ask them to strengthen the security set-up by installing gadgets like metal detectors, he said.

 Anuj Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, said: We will prepare a list of seminars that will be held in the coming days. During the seminar sessions, the number of policemen will be increased at the venue.

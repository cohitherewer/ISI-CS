 Srinagar, July 6: Kashmir minister Syed Bashir Ahmad survived unhurt today after heavily-armed militants opened fire on his car in the states highest security zone, in an ambush that came even before the scent of blood had faded from Ayodhyas streets.

 Three police escorts of the minister were injured by the rebels who struck despite a nation-wide alert in the wake of yesterdays bid to blow up the makeshift Ram temple in the heartland.

 Police said Bashir, the minister of state for public health engineering and irrigation, had just left the secretariat ? the seat of governance ? when the waiting militants opened fire. The rebels fled after security officials fired back.

 The minister escaped and we are cordoning the area to search for the militants, a senior police officer said.

 Witnesses said panicky pedestrians and shopkeepers in the busy centre of Lal Chowk ran for cover when the gunfire started. People were busy shopping when we heard a burst of gunfire. People ran here and there. I saw some policemen bleeding near their vehicle, witness Farooq Ahmad said.

 One report said the militants chased the two-vehicle convoy. 

 Bashir remained trapped in his bullet-proof car for half an hour as frantic messages flashed on police radios for reinforcements.

 As his eyes locked with the two pheran-clad youths who had pulled out their automatic rifles and started firing, Bashir thought it was the end. I was continuously looking at them as they indiscriminately fired at my car from a close range. For a moment I believed that it was the end of the road for me, he said over phone.

 I remained trapped in my car for more than 30 minutes as the car tyres were deflated after a sharp AK-47 burst hit them. This is happening in the city centre, which is the highest security area in the state.

 It was only after city police chief Syed Ahmed Syed reached the spot with heavy reinforcements that the minister could be rescued.

 A shaken Bashir came out of his car after police and paramilitary troops threw a cordon around the bullet-riddled vehicle. He was put in another bullet-proof car and escorted to his residence.

 A little-known militant outfit, the Islamic Front, claimed responsibility for the attack.

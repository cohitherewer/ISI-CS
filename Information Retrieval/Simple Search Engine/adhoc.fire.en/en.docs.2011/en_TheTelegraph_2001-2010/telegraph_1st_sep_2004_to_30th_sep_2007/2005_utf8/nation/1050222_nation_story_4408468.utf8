 Hurriyat in no hurry to board bus

 Gilani: Eager for talks (Picture by Rajesh Kumar)

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: The Hurriyat Conference always wanted the peace road to Delhi to go through Pakistan. In less than two months, a road will open from Srinagar to Muzaffarabad but there are no clear signs that it will bring the Hurriyat leaders any closer to Delhi.

 Hurriyat leader Abdul Gani Bhat believes that just as Delhi and Islamabad had demonstrated some flexibility to kickstart the bus service between the two Kashmirs, separatists, too, should reciprocate and visit Delhi before boarding the bus to the other side of the Line of Control.

 But others feel that more needs to be done to achieve a breakthrough.

 The Hurriyat leadership had wriggled out of talks last year ? with some help from Delhi that declared the dialogue would have to be within the four walls of the Constitution ? after attacks on the group?s acting chairman Mirwaiz Omar Farooq and his family.

 The combine was already under pressure from Pakistan and hardline elements within the separatists that accused the moderate leadership of selling out. For one, the Hurriyat was seen to be drifting too close to the NDA regime without getting any commensurate benefits to show their constituency back home.

 Syed Salim Gilani, the president of the JK Democratic Freedom Party ?a Hurriyat constituent ? suggests he has no problem if the separatists return to the talks table. But Gilani said Bhat?s statement was his personal opinion.

 ?India, like Bhat, needs to show that she has a large heart and let the leaders travel across the border. It could go a long way in resolving the problem by bringing in better understanding,? said Gilani, one of the few Hurriyat leaders in the Valley who have made the need for a peaceful resolution a talking point at his meetings.

 But more important, was the involvement of the Kashmiris in the Indo-Pak dialogue that appeared to be on the right track. ?We are a prime party to the dispute and without our involvement, there would be no permanent solution,? he said.

 Bilal Lone, the People?s Conference chief and Hurriyat executive member who participated in the first two rounds of talks with then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, too, has reservations about returning to Delhi at this point. Not until the separatists ? minus hardliner S.A.S. Geelani ? are able to project a united front. 

 ?Until and unless the other relevant people are included, the dialogue process would not be purposeful or have the legitimacy that a resolution will need,? Lone said, hinting at unity efforts targeted at JKLF chief Yasin Malik and Democratic Freedom Front leader Shabbir Shah.

 Shah, in turn, is not entirely convinced. ?Betrayed? more than once when the Centre withdrew its backing from official ?representatives?, he wants the Centre to make the first move now.

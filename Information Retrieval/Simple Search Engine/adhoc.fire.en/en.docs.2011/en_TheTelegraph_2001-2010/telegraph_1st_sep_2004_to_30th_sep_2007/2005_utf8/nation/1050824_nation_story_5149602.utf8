 Jalan calls for barefoot minister

 Jalan: Laying guidelines

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: A scheme aiming to tackle poverty should be overseen by a barefoot minister, MP Bimal Jalan told the government today.

 As the Lok Sabha approved the rural employment guarantee bill, ensuring at least 100 days of employment each year to every rural household, the former Reserve Bank governor cautioned the government to be very watchful while implementing it.

 He also explained how the minister in charge of the schemes effective execution should go about his job.

 The barefoot minister should be without red lights and other ostentatious paraphernalia, the Rajya Sabha member said.

 (He) should visit all states and districts included in the programme in the next 12 months and present a report to Parliament in August 2006 about how effective the scheme has been and how many jobs actually got created.

 Jalan reminded the government of failed schemes like the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana and the Sampoorna Gramin Rozgar Yojana.

 The amendments to the job bill ? allowing it to cover all rural households and fixing the minimum wage ? will cut through some of the red tape, he said, but cited several aspects that require careful bookkeeping and discretionary decisions at several levels. 

 For instance, the Centre should ensure that no more than 100 days of work in a year is provided in aggregate to members of the same household.

 Jalan also wants only one agency ? instead of many ? at the central level, headed by an executive chairman, to implement the gigantic scheme.

 The Centre is understood to have made a further amendment to the bill, laying down that workers must be paid Rs 60 for a days work or the minimum wage in force in the state, whichever is higher.

 During the Lok Sabha debate, rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh sought to allay the Oppositions fears that the funds would go down the drain. The scheme will be strictly monitored by village committees, he said.

 The panchayats will play a principal role in selection, implementation and monitoring of schemes, Singh said.

 In keeping with the bills provisions, the government will provide an unemployment allowance to families it fails to provide with the guaranteed job. The dole would match the minimum wage under the scheme

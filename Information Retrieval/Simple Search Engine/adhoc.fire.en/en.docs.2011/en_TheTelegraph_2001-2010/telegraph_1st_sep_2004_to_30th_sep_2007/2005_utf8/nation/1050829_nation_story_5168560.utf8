 Skeleton dangles tourism magnet

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Aug. 28: First, a copper sword. Then, three tunnels. Now, a skeleton with copper bracelets and a pearl necklace.

 These could well be remains from the age of the Pandavas and Kauravas and fodder for what is being called a Mahabharat tourism circuit.

 Proposed to be developed along the lines of the Buddhist circuit ? comprising places associated with Gautama Buddha ? it will centre around Baghpat, Hastinapur, Kurukshetra and some other places in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana (see map).

 An Archaeological Survey of India team stumbled upon the skeleton in Baghpat in west Uttar Pradesh on Monday during a dig sponsored by the state government. It was unearthed at Sinauli village, 395 km from here.

 If tests prove the skeleton belongs to the age of the Mahabharat ? circa 1700-1600 BC ? the tourism departments circuit proposal could get an impetus. The Pandavas are believed to have escaped through the tunnels after their house of lac was set on fire in the 14th year of their exile.

 The skeleton will be put through carbon-dating tests to ascertain its age, the deputy superintending archaeologist of Agra circle, S.K. Sharma, said.

 It could either be a relic from the age of the Mahabharat or the copper age (circa 2000 BC in western Uttar Pradesh).

 However, state tourism minister Kwakab Hameed said the copper bracelets suggested a pre-Harappan civilisation could have existed in the area.

 Independent India was not lucky enough to get anything from the Harappa and Mohenjodaro age since both sites went to Pakistan. We hope this will lead to unearthing of something like that here in India, he said.

 Hameed said if the tunnels could be reopened using latest technology, there will be big interest about the area among foreign tourists.

 The ASI had begun digging in Baghpat on July 17 after it was approached by the Uttar Pradesh tourism department. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 15 lakh and the state Rs 8 lakh for the circuit.

 We are in touch with the governments of Punjab and Haryana to develop the area as a Mahabharat circuit. We have an estimated budget of Rs 800 crore. We are waiting for history to come out of the wombs of time, Hameed said.

 With the hills gone to Uttaranchal and the Taj night viewing not proving a big draw, Uttar Pradesh has put its tourism where the Mahabharat is. Only, the skeleton holds the key.

 Breather for Oswal plant

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 7: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has asked the environment watchdog in Orissa to partially modify the directive issued to the Oswal fertiliser plant in Paradip on January 28.

 The Orissa Pollution Control Board (OPCB) had ordered the closure of the sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and di-ammonium phosphate units for the alleged failure of the Oswal authorities to comply with pollution norms.

 In his directive, OPCB chairperson Lalit Patnaik had said the plant had to be shut down under Section 31(A) of Air (prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1981 and Section 33(A) of Water (prevention and control) Act, 1974.

 Patnaik had also asked the collector of Jagatsinghpur district to ensure that the plant was closed down within seven days.

 Following the order, the plant authorities appealed to the CPCB, which has now ruled that the di-ammonium phosphate unit can operate. 

 In a meeting with CPCB officials, the Oswal representatives sought permission to operate the said unit on the ground that it had a huge stock of ammonia. They also assured that the pollution control devices were installed properly. 

 The company, however, cannot operate the two other units, the CPCB directed. The plant authorities will have to procure sulphuric and phosphoric acid from outside.

 Patnaik said the order issued by him on January 28 would be modified in line with the CPCB directive. 

 The Paradip Port Trust had imposed restrictions on the import and export of cargo from the Oswal plant following the OPCB order. As a result, an ammonia-laden ship of the Oswals has been waiting at the port for the past few days.

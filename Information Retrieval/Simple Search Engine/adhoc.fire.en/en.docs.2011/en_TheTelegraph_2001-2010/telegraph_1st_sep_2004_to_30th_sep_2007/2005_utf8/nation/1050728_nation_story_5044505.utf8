The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Stars amp; soaps stuck in water 

 - KBC amp; K-serial shoots called off, panic in air

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Aamir: Grounded

 Calcutta, July 27: It was a rainy-day holiday on the Bollywood sets as Mumbai came to a screeching halt today. 

 Low-lying Andheri and Goregaon, the hot spots for studios and shooting sites, were the worst hit, drowning schedules of everything from films to serials to advertisements. They were all either scrapped or postponed indefinitely.

 The biggest casualty was Amitabh Bachchan and his Kaun Banega Crorepati. While the elaborate set at Film City is quite high up, you just cant enter the area, said a STAR spokesperson. Now getting an extra day from Mr Bachchan to make up for the two episodes we couldnt shoot would be tough.

 If the KBC crew was hanging on to the ummeed ki dori (thread of hope), Aamir Khan was left clutching an air ticket he couldnt avail of. He was then stuck on the road for hours.

 Another star grounded by the flooding of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport was Sameera Reddy, part of the team of director Sachin Bajajs film that failed to take off for a Bangkok outdoor. 

 She was stuck for more than seven hours on the road, from Mahim to the airport in Santa Cruz, said sister and model-turned-actor Sushama.

 The impact of the big washout could be felt most on the small screen. Almost all shoots for Ektaa Kapoors K-sagas ? Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Kahiin To Hoga, Kasautii Zindagii Kay and Kkusum ? were called off, sparking panic on whether enough software would be ready for the coming weeks. 

 Ektaa is known to keep everything for the very last moment and the tapes are only sent to Hong Kong on the last day, said a source in Balaji Telefilms.

 If the rain may prompt a break in soap sagas, it can also throw ad campaigns astray. Its taking hours to move from one part of the city to another ? how can you have an entire shooting crew reporting on the sets on time? asked Parineeta director Pradeep Sarkar, who had to cancel a Maggi ad-film shoot today.

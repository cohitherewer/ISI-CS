 Income crown for Indians in SA

 Durban (PTI): Indians have edged past 

 other communities in South Africa in terms of household 

 income because of the importance given to education, thus 

 making them the most successful in the new democracy, a 

 survey has found.

 The household income of Indians in at least five provinces ? Limpopo, North West, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape and Western ? has overtaken other communities, the study conducted by Global Insight Southern Africa said. 

 However, the situation has not changed significantly in Kwazulu-Natal and Gauteng, two provinces where people of Indian origin predominate.

 The research shows that between 1996 and 2003, dramatic changes have taken place in household incomes of all communities.

 African households have had an increase of 71 per cent with an average annual income of Rand 45 513; blacks by 81 per cent to R 76 322; Indians by 79 per cent to R 148 822; and whites by 56 per cent to R 196 000.

 The figures dispelled old notions of wealth distribution, director of the study, Frans Cronje, said. ?This shows us that slowly but surely, the inequality between groups is starting to decline. The image of the rich-white, poor-black South Africa is perhaps not perfectly accurate.?

 Bhujbal gets terror-case call

 Mumbai (PTI): A special court has asked 

 Maharashtra PWD minister Chhagan Bhujbal, former city police 

 commissioner M.N. Singh and two other top police officers 

 to appear as defence witnesses on a plea by suspected terrorist 

 Mohammad Afroz despite stiff opposition from the prosecution.

 Afroz had urged the court to examine Bhujbal and others as witnesses as they had sanctioned his prosecution.

 The court also issued on Friday a bailable warrant against Pradip Sawant, suspended deputy commissioner of police, asking him to appear on February 18 as defence witness to tender evidence in Afroz?s case. Sawant had failed to appear on two earlier occasions.

 Afroz was arrested on October 2, 2002, on the charge of waging war against the nation. According to police, he was part of al Qaida group, which had planned to blow up the Parliament House in Delhi, the House of Commons in the UK and the Rialto tower in Australia. He was booked under the anti-terror act but the charge was later dropped. He is now being tried under the IPC.

 28 die as bus falls in gorge

 Udhampur (PTI): Twenty-eight people 

 were killed and 29 injured when a bus in which they were 

 travelling fell into a gorge in Udhampur district. The bus 

 was on its way to Udhampur town from Ramnagar when it skidded 

 off the road and fell into the 300-ft gorge at Barman around 

 11.45 am, official sources said.

 Pakistanis held

 Ahmedabad (PTI): Five Pakistani 

 nationals who had illegally entered Indian waters have been 

 arrested by the coast guard. The Pakistanis, claiming to 

 be fishermen, were detained last Friday and their boats 

 seized at least eight nautical miles into Indian territorial 

 waters off the Okha coast in Jamnagar district, official 

 sources said.

 Mishap toll rises

 Nagpur (PTI): The toll in Thursday?s 

 passenger train mishap at Kanhan rose to 57 with two persons 

 succumbing at the Government Medical College hospital on 

 Saturday. A train had crashed into a tractor-trolley carrying 

 members of a marriage party, about 30 km from here on Thursday. 

 Sixteen injured persons are being treated at the government 

 hospital and the Indira Gandhi Medical College hospital, 

 police added.

 Loot on train

 Sonepat (PTI): Five youths looted 

 four passengers travelling on a Delhi-bound passenger train 

 between Samalkha and Bodhwal Majri railway stations about 

 35 km from here on Saturday night. According to the passengers, 

 the youths, armed with pistols and other weapons, got down 

 from the running train at Bodhwal Majri after looting cash 

 and valuables.

 Medha case

 Mumbai (PTI): A case has been filed 

 against social activist Medha Patkar for illegal assembly 

 and pulling down cement posts and barbed wires erected by 

 the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to fence an area 

 cleared after demolition. Patkar, along with members of 

 some voluntary organisations, was protesting the demolition 

 of slums at Rafiq Nagar in north-east Mumbai.

 The latest uses of mapping technologies in disaster management and areas like defence, industrial planning and urban development will be discussed at the Map India, 2005 conference beginning in New Delhi from Monday.

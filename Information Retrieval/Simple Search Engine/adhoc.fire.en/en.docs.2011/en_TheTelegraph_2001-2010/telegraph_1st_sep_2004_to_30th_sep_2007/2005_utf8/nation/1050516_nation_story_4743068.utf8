 UN eye on leprosy 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 15: A UN sub-commission investigating cases of social discrimination based on leprosy even after the patients have been cured is set to advocate to the General Assembly that such discrimination be made a violation of basic human rights.

 Cured leprosy patients are not only deprived of marriage, they are denied property rights and suffer neglect within the family. Such social discrimination should no longer prevail in the 21st century, Yohei Sasakawa, the World Health Organisation goodwill ambassador to eradicate leprosy worldwide, said today.

 After inaugurating a regional conference on leprosy, Sasakawa said he had made an appeal to the UN on the basis of which the sub-commission was appointed to study the discriminating practices and submit a report to the world body. Sasakawa is also the president of the Japan-based Nippon Foundation, which is assisting several countries to eradicate leprosy.

 He said members of the UN sub-commission had recently conducted investigations in Pune, Johannesburg and in Brazil. The sub-commission will submit its report in August. We want to take this to the attention of the General Assembly at the highest level of the UN and urge it (to) adopt a resolution to help stop social discrimination against leprosy patients, he said.

 Once the General Assembly adopts a resolution and makes recommendations to tackle the problem, the UN member states and governments at the central and state level in various countries will have to follow the recommendations, he said.

 Since social discrimination is partly a problem of human attitude, a grassroots approach could be taken so that those afflicted by the disease are provided an enabling environment that will make them independent, said Sasakawa.

 Though India had one of the largest number of leprosy patients in the world, Sasakawa said he was confident it would be able to reduce the prevalence rate to less than one person per 10,000 by the end of 2005. Several Indian states, including Tamil Nadu, had done well on this front, he pointed out.

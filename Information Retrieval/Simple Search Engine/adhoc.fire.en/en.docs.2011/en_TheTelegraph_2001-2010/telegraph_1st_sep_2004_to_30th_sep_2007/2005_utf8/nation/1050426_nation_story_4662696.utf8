 Govt springs to defence of Siwan DM

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, April 25: Political attacks, coming mainly from Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav, on Siwan district magistrate Chandrakant Kumar Anil have again bit the dust with the government recommending to the Lok Sabha secretariat that privilege proceedings against the young IAS officer be dropped forthwith.

 Anil, assisted by superintendent of police Ratan Sanjay and the Special Task Force, has taken on Siwan ?sultan? Mohammad Shahabuddin and the privilege notice had come on a representation made by the controversial RJD MP, an accused in several criminal cases, to Speaker Somnath Chatterjee.

 ?It is for Parliament to take a final decision. As far as the state government is concerned, we agree with the reply submitted by the district magistrate on why he has taken certain decision relating to the MP. There is no reason to condemn him (Anil) with a breach of privilege,? chief secretary K.A.H. Subramaniam said.

 In his reply, Anil has given a detailed history of criminal and other cases pending against Shahabuddin. He has also stated that the MP gave incorrect details about the cases he is facing while submitting the mandatory affidavit to the Election Commission.

 It is a coincidence that every political attack on the district magistrate has been followed by a fresh action against Shahabuddin and yesterday was the climax of the process when his two houses in Pratappur village were raided by the STF in the presence of Anil and Sanjay.

 The raids continued even today. STF sources said the recovery of large amounts of foreign currency, including those from some Arab countries, have aroused strong suspicions about the ?goings on?. An STF source said some of the cartridges recovered in the raid bear the mark of a Pakistan ordnance factory.

 Shahabuddin, whose henchmen are believed to have killed popular CPI (M-L) leader and JNU students? union president Chandrashekhar in 1995, is understood to have defended the presence of foreign currency with the fact of his possessing a passport for foreign travels.

 The controversial MP, who is known for his ruthless conduct especially in eliminating his enemies, has already suffered a major face-loss in Siwan, which he used to run as his ?fiefdom?. ?He has been cut to size. Laloo Prasad does not like this fact because Shahabuddin is seen as the leader of a section of the minorities. We want that action against him should be intensified,? a senior BJP leader said. 

 Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan has also praised the work done by the district magistrate while the RJD minorities? wing has condemned it as ?victimisation?.

 Reports from Siwan said the administration has been getting a lot of tip-offs on the ?excesses? committed by Shahabuddin, besides details of his ?operations?.

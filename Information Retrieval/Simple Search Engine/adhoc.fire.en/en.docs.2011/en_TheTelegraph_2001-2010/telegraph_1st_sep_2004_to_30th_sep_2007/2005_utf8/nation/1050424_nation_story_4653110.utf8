 Hizb ready to consider ceasefire

 Srinagar, April 23 (PTI): Militant outfit Hizb-ul Mujahideen has said it is ready to consider a ceasefire, provided security forces implement it on the ground.

 ?If New Delhi announces a ceasefire and (the) ground situation reflects the same, Hizb-ul Mujahideen will consider it seriously,? the outfit?s self-styled chief commander, operations, Gazi Misbahuddin, told a local news agency in an interview published in regional newspapers today.

 Alleging that announcements made by New Delhi in the past had proved unreliable, he said under the circumstances, waiting for a ceasefire was ?meaningless?.

 Demanding a role for militants in the settlement of the Kashmir issue, he said his organisation was also active on the political front. ?India, Pakistan and the recognised leadership of Kashmiris can sit and find a solution.?

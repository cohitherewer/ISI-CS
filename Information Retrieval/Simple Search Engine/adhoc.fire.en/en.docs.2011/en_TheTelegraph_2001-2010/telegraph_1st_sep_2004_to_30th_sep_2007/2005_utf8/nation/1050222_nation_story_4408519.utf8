 Shield for IAS whistle-blower

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: The Supreme Court today restrained the CBI and Haryana police from arresting Sanjeev Kumar, an IAS officer who blew the whistle on the Haryana primary teachers? appointment scam.

 Kumar, who had filed a public interest litigation exposing the scam, complained to the court that he was being harassed through CBI raids and accusations of amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income.

 Taking a serious view of the complaint, Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti summoned the CBI director to his chamber on March 7 to personally ?explain the proceedings? initiated against Kumar.

 The CBI, in raids conducted recently, claimed to have found assets worth more than Rs 2 crore which, it said, was ?disproportional? to Kumar?s ?known sources of income?.

 The court ordered that he should not be arrested nor any action launched against him in connection with the raids.

 On the basis of Kumar?s petition ? which led to his suspension by the Haryana government ? the court in September 2003 had directed the CBI to probe the appointment of 3,200 teachers in the state, allegedly on payment of bribes.

 The chief justice observed: ?Prima facie we are of the view that the earlier order for a probe into the main matter should have been carried to its logical end, but the agency (CBI) appears to have diverted its attention to something else.?

 Anil Divan, senior counsel for Kumar, told the court that ?a superintendent of police in the CBI?, who was in charge of the probe into the teachers? appointment scam, had ?asked for bribes from the complainant? (Kumar) and the ?refusal to comply with the illegal request? had made the CBI inimical towards Kumar and hence the raids. Divan contended that a special investigation team, instead of the CBI, should probe the matter as the bureau was pursuing it in a ?skewed manner?. 

 Divan also told the court that Kumar had brought to its notice how chief minister Om Prakash Chautala and his aides had manipulated and replaced the original list of selected candidates.

 He said the CBI did not launch any investigation against Chautala whose ?complicity? in the scam had been exposed by Kumar before the court. Divan said the Supreme Court should monitor the progress of the bureau?s investigation. 

 Additional solicitor general P.P. Malhotra, who appeared for the CBI, said investigations into the main issue were on but the agency could not ?keep its eyes shut to the illegalities committed by the complainant?.

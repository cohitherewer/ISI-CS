 Eastern trains cancelled

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Oct. 29: Several trains were cancelled after the derailment in Nalgonda today, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.

 The Howrah-bound Coromandel Express, Nagercoil-Howrah Gurudev Express, Gorakhpur Express, Dhanbad Express and Guwahati Express were among the trains cancelled. 

 The Howrah Mail would run tonight from Chennai, railway authorities said, but it is being diverted through Renigunta, Guntakkal and Guntur. 

 The incessant rain in the city and its suburbs this week had already hit rail traffic, turning the metropoliss station into a transit camp for the past two days.

 In the city, some parts stayed submerged for the third day and residents were stuck indoors without access to food and other essentials.

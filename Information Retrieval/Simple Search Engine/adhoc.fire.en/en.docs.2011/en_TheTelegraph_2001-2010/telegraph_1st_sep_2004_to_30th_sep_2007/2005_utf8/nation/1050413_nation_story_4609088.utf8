 Try social service, needles VHP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: And now, it?s the VHP?s turn to get into the act.

 Even as the BJP rallied behind Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who had been criticised by RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan, the VHP today targeted the former Prime Minister and accused him of ?torpedoing? the Hindu movement.

 Acharya Giriraj Kishore, senior vice-president of the Sangh affiliate, endorsed Sudarshan?s allegations. 

 ?The RSS chief had pointed to a principle. Even Nanaji Deshmukh had set an example in the BJP that those in power politics, aspiring for public office, should retire after attaining the age of 60,? he said, supporting Sudarshan?s comments that Vajpayee and BJP chief L.K. Advani should make way for younger leaders.

 ?Vajpayee and Advani should now guide the party and allow the new generation to take over,? Giriraj said here. 

 He also targeted Vajpayee?s foster son-in-law Ranjan Bhattacharya, saying he belongs to an ?American lobby? and had ?direct links with Italy?.

 Asked why the VHP, too, did not rate Vajpayee among the country?s best Prime Ministers, he said: ??He torpedoed the Hindu movement. He talked about a fight to finish (aar paar ki ladai) with regard to Pakistan but nothing happened. The country?s defence minister (George Fernandes) was frisked (at a US airport) but he did not do anything. The country needs a brilliant Prime Minister, not somebody who compromises.?

 On Sudarshan?s charge that Vajpayee and Advani did not do enough on the Ayodhya issue, Giriraj said: ?Both leaders did not perform their due role. Now, they are remembering Ayodhya. Ayodhya should not become a ladder for them.?

 On whether the RSS chief himself and the VHP?s leaders should step down because of age, Giriraj said they are not holding ?posts of profit?. ?It is not applicable to social service where one can continue till health permits. Vajpayee and Advani, too, are welcome to do social service.?

 Dinner scores over diamond

 New Delhi, July 31: Men trying to win the hearts of women, pay heed ? dinner and cinema may be far more effective courtship gifts than expensive jewellery. 

 A mathematical model that analysed the features of good courtship gifts has indicated that a gift which is costly to the man but is intrinsically worthless to the woman facilitates courtship, scientists said last week. 

 The researchers modelled courtship as a sequential game between the sexes in which there is gift-giving along with uncertainty and possible conflict of interest and outcomes that include dumping after accepting a gift. 

 In a courtship situation, each player has some uncertainty about his or her own attractiveness to a potential partner. But attractiveness alone is not enough and a male must display some additional signals of good intention, said Rob Seymour, a mathematician at the University College of Londons Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology. 

 While gifts signal good intentions, men also need to be wary about gold-digging females who might dump them after accepting valuable gifts. 

 Seymour and his colleague Peter Sozou said an expensive gift that is intrinsically worthless to women would deter gold-diggers because a woman would not waste her time on a worthless gift unless she is serious about the man. 

 Theres not much to be gained by a woman accepting a gift that is costly but worthless unless she likes the man, Sozou said. 

 The scientists said dinner, cinema and theatre tickets are examples of costly but intrinsically worthless gifts. Costly but valuable gifts would include money or items that cost substantial amounts of money, including electrical goods or expensive jewellery with high resale value. 

 This kind of gift makes the male potentially open to exploitation by a gold-digger, Sozou said. 

 The mathematical study of courtship gifts, published in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, was intended to analyse gift-giving that plays an important role in biology. 

 Its important to understand how gifts function as mediators of trust, said Seymour. Courtship is particularly important because reproduction is a vital biological function and its important that both humans and animals get it right. 

 Humans arent the only species that engage in courtship gift-giving. In the past, biologists have observed gift-giving in insects and birds. They say there is sexual asymmetry in gift-giving ? its men who give gifts in courtship situations because mating is biologically more costly for a female than a male. 

 She has to carry and bring up offspring after giving birth. The male only has to impregnate the female and hes free to desert her. Its important for a female to get reassurance that he wont do this before agreeing to mate, Seymour said. 

 The male doesnt need such reassurance, he said. 

 Seymour and Sozou developed two versions of the model. In a version that applies to humans, in which males may sometimes desert females, gifts are signals of good intentions. In the second version that applies to species such as insects where females get no help from males in the care of offspring, the gift signals the males condition and thus his quality.

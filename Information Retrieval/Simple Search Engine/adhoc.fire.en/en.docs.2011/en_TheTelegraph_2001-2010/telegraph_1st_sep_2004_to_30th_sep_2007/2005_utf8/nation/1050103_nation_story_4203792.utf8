 Law board rift on family planning

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Kalbe Sadiq

 Lucknow, Jan. 2: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board today lurched into another crisis when its vice-president fired a salvo against its recent moves, especially involving family planning.

 The board is already caught in a Shia-Sunni schism over adequate representation. Today, its only Shia representative, Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, demanded emphasis on the need for family planning and abolition of triple talaq.

 A week ago, the board?s executive body had passed a model nikaahnama (marriage contract) that discouraged triple talaq, but ducked issues like family planning.

 After the executive meeting in Lucknow, spokesman Abdul Rahim Qureshi had said that the board would not propose any family planning measure as it was against the spirit of Islam.

 ?When Qureshi says in his press briefing that Islam does not permit family planning, I don?t think he is telling the truth,? Kalbe Sadiq said this afternoon at a news conference here at the Press Club of Uttar Pradesh.

 ?The truth is the Sunni sect may not be admitting family control. Islam does admit it. Abortions and family control are two different issues. Qureshi is confusing the two,? Kalbe Sadiq said on the eve of his three-month foreign trip.

 He iterated his liberal view that Muslims should opt for small families in the age of science and technology. He first aired this view in July last year when he called for a two-child family norm, only to be shouted down by fellow board members.

 The community, Kalbe Sadiq said, need not grow in ?quantity? but should produce quality citizens. ?I want all the Muslim young men and women to be properly educated. This cannot happen in large families. The need of the hour is a small family.?

 He added that 56 countries practise family planning and others are fast catching up.

 Kalbe Sadiq, the seniormost Shia cleric, is planning to raise the issue at the board?s general body meeting scheduled for March in Bhopal.

 He emphasised the need for clear instructions on divorce just as in the case of marriage when he said, in a lighter vein, that the board?s executive had cleared the model nikaahnama but not a triple ?talaqnama?. Triple talaq, he said, is not permitted in the Shia sect.

 Kalbe Sadiq demanded the abolition of triple talaq and sought simultaneous prayers by men and women in mosques and coeducational institutions.

 Asked if his reformist views would not alienate him from the other board members, Kalbe Sadiq said: ?Intelligent and radical men and women are always in a minority.?

 He did not admit that airing his views could weaken the community?s unity but instead jumped to the defence of the board, criticising poorly informed leaders of his sect who had cried hoarse over poor representation.

 ?Four Shia members died and those positions have to be filled in by fresh leaders. But sometimes, the Shia members either stay away from (board) meetings or do not champion key issues for the community,? Kalbe Sadiq said.

 He also took exception to the way maulanas in Hyderabad and other disparate sects had threatened to launch parallel boards.

 Last month, a senior maulana of the Bareilvi school of thinking in the Sunni sect had cried foul over the Deobandi school?s hegemony and threatened to launch a new board. This had coincided with similar threats by Shia leaders.

 Listless BJP looks to past

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, was the butt of jokes in his own party today.

 As Malhotra insisted the Centre clarify whether the Nanavati Commission report on the 1984 Sikh killings will be tabled today, his party members whispered he had caught the smran (recall) flu from his leader, L.K. Advani.

 In Advanis public speeches, the theme nowadays is smran, as if signifying a retreat from the present to the past.

 The BJP president would utter one of his favourite phrases ? mujhe smran hai ki... (I recall that...) ? and hark back, say, to his days in jail during Emergency. Or to the time when he was a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharak in Rajasthan, tasked to persuade party MLAs to vote against the abolition of privy purses.

 Malhotra, too, had his eyes fixed on the past as the House got ready to discuss a calling attention motion on PSU divestment, especially Bhel, tabled by CPI members Gurudas Dasgupta and S. Sudhakar Reddy.

 The Speaker said he could take up the subject of the Nanavati panel report during zero hour, but Malhotra wouldnt relent. The BJP ignored the pleas and walked out.

 BJP sources are worried that a week and a half into the monsoon session, the party has steadily been yielding the Opposition space to the Left and the Samajwadi Party. 

 The reason, they believe, is the BJPs inability to say anything interesting on the biggest issues in Parliament: divestment and the Indo-US nuclear and defence pacts.

 Asked what the BJPs stand on Bhel divestment was, Malhotra turned to baiting the Left and the Congress.

 The CPM is on record saying that Sonia Gandhi assured them the matter would be put in the cold storage. Today the finance minister justified the decision to divest 10 per cent shares in Bhel. We want to know what the truth is.

 Pressed, he added: I will not say if we are supporting or opposing the decision.

 Party sources explained that it was the Vajpayee government that had begun the process ? not only of staking out government shares in PSUs but of selling the units. Therefore, it is very tough for the BJP to backtrack now.

 The sources also spoke of two other factors behind the BJPs lacklustre showing in the House. Advanis position as the leader of the Opposition has been undermined by the Jinnah controversy. There is a question mark on his continuance, a BJP source said.

 Second, our best talent is in the Rajya Sabha. Barring A.B. Vajpayee and Advani ? and to an extent Malhotra and B.C. Khanduri ? we have no speakers in the Lok Sabha.

 Even Advani, who was to breathe fire on July 26 at the discussion on an adjournment motion relating to the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, was caught out by the defence minister. 

 Pranab Mukherjee told Advani that he had erred in saying that illegal immigration had started in 1947. There was virtually no protest from the BJP benches.

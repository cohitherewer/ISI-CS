 Sant backs Advani

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 Swami Vishvesha Teerth

 New Delhi, June 16: Swami Vishvesha Teerth, one of the founding members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, today defended BJP president, L.K. Advani, and thanked the Pakistan government for the renovation work planned on temples there.

 He denied factionalism in the VHP but added that there are some people in the VHP who are taking the VHP away from what it was intended for. The comment is being seen as a veiled reference to those trying to proscribe Advani from the Sangh parivar.

 The swami was one of the few among the sadhus and sants who had opposed the VHP resolution that asked Advani to take political sanyas.

 I deem it to be my duty to explain to the people at large, and to my brothers and sisters in the Hindu community in particular, the reasons for my opposing the resolution, the swami told a press conference.

 He termed the language used against Advani in the resolution unrestrained and uncivilised. Sants can never endorse it. Use of such language to deride a widely admired leader like Shri Advani ? has bewildered the Hindu society, he said.

 Tech rule to spread wings 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 7: In a bid to take e-governance to the grassroots, the Centre has decided to network 1 lakh villages through common service centres (CSC)s by 2007.

 Unveiling an action plan at the valedictory session of the eighth national e-governance conference here on Saturday, joint secretary in the Union information technology department R. Chandrasekhar said every village can access the CSCs using the honeycomb pattern.

 The centres will provide a host of utility services, including the collection of payment for government units. Steps will be taken to make them commercially viable and the available infrastructure of the post office and panchayat network can be leveraged for the purpose, he added.

 The action plan has laid emphasis on building able e-governance ?champions, teams and institutions?. It also stresses the need to replicate successful projects, which are citizen-centric and not department-centric.

 The Centre has formed a task force for e-governance administration, which will help develop government call centre networks and offer kiosk-based delivery of services to citizens. It will also help institutions prepare the curriculum for cyber law courses.

 The task force will comprise various government departments and academic institutions. 

 While the Centre for E-governance at IIM, Calcutta and the Oracle-HP E-governance Centre of Excellence will be in charge of the task force, the departments of IT and administrative reforms will act as advisers. PricewaterhouseCoopers, Intel and Red Hat are the other key players in the task force.

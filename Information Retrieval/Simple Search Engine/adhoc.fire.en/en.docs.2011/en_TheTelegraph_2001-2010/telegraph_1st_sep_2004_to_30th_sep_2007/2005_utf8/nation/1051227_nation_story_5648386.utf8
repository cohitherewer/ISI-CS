 Bardhan fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: A.B. Bardhan today made good use of the CPIs 80th anniversary by sending out a stern message to the United Progressive Alliance government on its economic policies.

 We are in a dilemma. It is not our intention to topple this government. But we are requesting this government to give priority to issues like poverty, unemployment and illiteracy, said the CPI general secretary to a packed auditorium where the party cadre had gathered for the occasion. 

 Bardhan told the cadre what they wanted to hear. They applauded every time he spoke about the heroic struggles by the party and warned the UPA government to roll back its policy of liberalisation. 

 We are not pulling down the government but we will not have it duping the people, Bardhan said. 

 An impression seems to be gaining ground among the rank and file that the Left leadership is yielding too easily to the economic dictates of the UPA government, which it supports. 

 Bardhan tried his best to dispel the notion, launching a frontal attack on the Centres policies to woo foreign direct investment and reform labour laws. We do not know what love this government has for FDI and FII (foreign institutional investors). Now it wants to bring FDI in retail trade. They want to get Walmart. Do they know how many cases have been lodged against Walmart? 

 He attacked the RSS and the BJP and made it clear the Left is backing the Congress-led government if only to keep the BJP out of power.

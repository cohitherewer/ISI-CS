 Singh in fathers footsteps

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: Father Gurmukh Singh would come to Kabul to sell foodgrain. Half a century on, son Manmohan Singh will visit the Afghan capital to sell democracy.

 The foundation stone for a parliament house, being built by the central public works department, will be laid during the Indian Prime Ministers historic two-day trip starting on Sunday. Singh will also offer a fully-renovated school and a $50-million financial package to the people of the war-ravaged country.

 The Prime Ministers family had trade links with Afghanistan, foreign secretary Shyam Saran said today without getting into details.

 But the son will not be merely retracing the trader fathers steps; he will be making history of sorts as the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Kabul in 29 years. Indira Gandhi was the last, in 1976.

 The following decades plunged Afghanistan into political chaos and mindless violence. India regained a foothold in Kabul only after the Americans forced the Taliban out.

 In the past four years, Delhis role in rebuilding Afghanistan has grown. It is one of the key donors trying to revive the countrys shattered economy and has already committed more than $500 million in building infrastructure and developing the social sector.

 Saran said India is playing an important role in bringing back stability in Afghanistan. India believes this can be achieved when all ethnic groups get proper representation.

 Pranab push for trade routes

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Tezpur and Rangiya (Assam), Sept. 22: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today set the tone for the forthcoming negotiations on the boundary with China and said India favours opening more land routes for trade.

 Mukherjee was to visit Tawang and Bumla near the Line of Actual Control with China in Arunachal Pradesh this morning but the trip was cancelled because of bad weather. 

 However, the defence minister read from a speech prepared for troops at Bumla at a separate gathering in the armys Red Horns divisional headquarters in Rangiya.

 Trade with China through Nathu-la in Sikkim is to be revived with the route reopening from October 2. With Indias relations with its neighbours improving, more routes for international trade can be opened, Mukherjee told the troops.

 Very soon trade through Nathu-la could re-start. We want that such trade (across the land border) be made possible at more points for benefit of the people in the border areas of both countries, he said.

 The defence minister said he had been briefed extensively on the situation along the borders by the army command, corps and divisional headquarters during this three-day trip to the Northeast that ended today.

 Mukherjees engagements with the army through the tour reflected Delhis eagerness to stick to the negotiating table with China with whom military confidence-building measures were now being institutionalised.

 For the past few years, our relations with China are improving steadily, Mukherjee said. 

 In Tawang and in Bumla army officials have been meeting socially for festivals and our national days. We want to resolve all disputes through dialogue, he said.

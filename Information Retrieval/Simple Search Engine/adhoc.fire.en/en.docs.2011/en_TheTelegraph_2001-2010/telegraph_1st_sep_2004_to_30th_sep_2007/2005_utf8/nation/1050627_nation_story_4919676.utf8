 Laloo trial for Digvijay

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Digvijay: Tough task

 Bhopal, June 26: Digvijay Singhs appointment as the Congress point man in Bihar will be a litmus test for the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, who harbours hopes of stepping into the shoes of one-time mentor Arjun Singh and eventually succeeding him as the Thakur leader from the heartland.

 The posting has dealt a blow to the 75-year-old Arjun Singh, who had been criticised over his failure to stitch a grand secular alliance in Bihar and Jharkhand and the United Progressive Alliances inability to present a united face and form the government in Patna.

 The appointment has also affected Congress Working Committee member Harikesh Bahadur, a Thakur leader from Uttar Pradesh who was looking after party affairs in Bihar. Bahadur, a protege of the late Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna, is in Digvijays age group.

 The Bihar assignment would not be easy for Digvijay, the former raja of Rajgarh. He was given a similar assignment in early 2002 for Uttar Pradesh but his presence failed to make an impact in the Assembly polls where party nominees forfeited deposits in 325 out of 402 seats. In Afzalgarh, the Congress candidate finished eleventh.

 Digvijays primary task would involve holding seat-sharing negotiations with Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, who had offered the Congress 21 seats for the Assembly polls in early 2005, terming it generous. 

 Laloo Prasad had, to back up his stand, pointed out to a Congress team of Arjun Singh, M.L. Fotedar and Ahmad Patel that the party had won 11 seats in the 2000 Assembly elections and had finished second in seven.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi had then decided to go it alone with a tacit understanding with Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party, but the final tally of 10 seats was far from impressive.

 The Congress will have to win most of the seats granted to it to justify a larger share of seats but the partys organisational weakness is proving to be a big handicap.

 Digvijay also has the daunting task of bringing Laloo Prasad and Paswan together. He would have liked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or the Congress chief stepping in to solve the matter. 

 However, Manmohan Singh or Sonia do not seem to be much inclined to give the two warring leaders in Bihar a choice of either burying the hatchet or shipping out for the sake of the coalitions unity.

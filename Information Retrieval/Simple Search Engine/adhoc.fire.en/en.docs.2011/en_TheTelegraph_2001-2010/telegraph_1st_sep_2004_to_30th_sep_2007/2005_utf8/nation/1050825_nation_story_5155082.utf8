 Singapore flights

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: India and Singapore have decided to increase the number of flights between the two countries. 

 Calcutta, Bangalore and Hyderabad will get additional flights. The number roughly translates into around 450 additional seats from Calcutta, said Bharath Mahadevan of Singapore Airlines.

 Designated airlines from both countries will be allowed to operate additional flights. 

 Also, a certain number of flights from both countries will be allowed to fly beyond Singapore and India, as transit services.

 Representatives of the two countries met in Delhi on Tuesday and Wednesday to revise the Air Services Agreement between the two countries which dates back to 1968.

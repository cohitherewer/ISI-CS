 China rejects plea on shahtoosh

New Delhi, May 22: China has declined Indias request for rare Tibetan antelopes to breed in captivity for shahtoosh wool.

 The antelope, known in India as the chiru, is in demand for its under-fleece that is used for making priceless shahtoosh shawls by weavers in Jammu and Kashmir. 

 Last Tuesday, the Union textiles ministrys proposal for captive breeding of chirus was put before a Chinese delegation during the meeting of the Tiger Enforcement Task Force of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in Delhi. Besides the illegal trade in tiger skin, the task force was to also discuss the continuing illegal trade in the wool of the Tibetan antelope. 

 Shahtoosh shawls are banned under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and possession is punishable with a jail term. A global ban is also in place. One shawl can cost over Rs 30,000 and at times even lakhs. 

 A source said the Chinese turned down Indias request citing several reasons. The delegation pointed out that the breeding biology of the chiru is not yet clear. These animals have never been kept in captivity and not a single zoo in the world has a chiru. They said the animal can survive only at altitudes of about 5,000 m above the sea level and if brought down to 3,000 m it may die.

 Most important, the captive breeding of an endangered species like the chiru for trade would require the permission from Cites. Earlier, such proposals on other animals have not been approved by the 167 nations that are its signatories. A permission would allow India to go ahead with the controlled breeding. 

 The textile ministrys request for chirus came after a representation from the Jammu and Kashmir government.

 Last year, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Kashmir, weavers had requested him to restore their means of livelihood ? the making of shahtoosh shawls. At this, the PMO had told the textiles ministry to set up a committee to discuss the captive breeding of chirus for their wool without killing them.

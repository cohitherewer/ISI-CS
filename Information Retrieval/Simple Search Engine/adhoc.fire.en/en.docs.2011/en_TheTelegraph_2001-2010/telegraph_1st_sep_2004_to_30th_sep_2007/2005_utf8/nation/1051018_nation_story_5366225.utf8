 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: Government schemes for development of rural infrastructure will soon be monitored online.

 Announcing this at a meeting of the District Rural Development Agencies today, rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said monitoring will ensure that effective delivery mechanisms are in place. 

 This is the only way the benefits of various government schemes are going to percolate down to the people. There will be online monitoring of schemes to check whether they are being implemented properly, he said.

 The government is particularly concerned about the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. The rural development ministry has gone to the extent of placing advertisements asking everyone concerned ? NGOs, political parties, experts and others ? for suggestions on how to effectively implement this much-hyped scheme. 

 Our major concern is to check corruption and see to it that the benefits of these schemes actually reach the people, the minister said.

 The ministry has already appointed national quality monitors for the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna to inspect road safety, infrastructure and construction. 

 Reports and assessments are routinely put up on the ministrys website, making the progress of the Yojna and assessment of the quality of roads more transparent. 

 The ministry is working towards evolving a similar plan for the other mega-schemes like the Bharat Nirman project and rural employment.

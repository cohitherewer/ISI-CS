 Mukutmanipur, Sept. 1: The city-bred can now savour the tribal way of life from much closer than before.

 Tribal welfare minister Upen Kisku yesterday unveiled a family tourism scheme, in which the state government plans to arrange for tourists to stay at the homes of Shabar and Santhal families. 

 The government will start the process of identifying some tribal families and giving licences to them later this year.

 This type of family tourism is rare in the country, Kisku said. 

 This will allow researchers or other interested persons to directly interact with the tribals and watch from close their lives and culture. This will also provide these tribals an opportunity to earn some money.

 The minister also inaugurated a renovated Peerless Resort at Mukutmanipur, some 230 km from Calcutta, and unveiled proposals for three speciality educational institutions in Bankura.

 We plan to set up a university in the name of Santhal scholar Raghunath Murmu at the foot of the Kangsavati Barrage in Ranibandh. Work is expected to be complete by 2006, Kisku said.

 According to the minister, the university will provide, apart from traditional courses, agro-based technological ones. 

 This university will generate good employment in this area, he said.

 Apart from this, a tribal dance training institute will be set up on a 30-bigha plot. This institute will be set up on 30 bighas. Already, a sum of Rs 10 lakh has been allocated. The total project cost has been estimated at Rs 1 crore, which we plan to finish in a phased manner. The work will begin by the Pujas this year, the minister said.

 Talks are also on with a private company to set up an English-medium school that will accommodate 5,000 students and will have a hostel. This will give Bankura a special status in the state as students from all over Bengal will come here.

 Earlier, during the inauguration of the Peerless Resort, S.K. Roy, general manager of Peerless, said his company has a strong bond with Mukutmanipur. 

 We are sure Mukutmanipur will soon be one of the best tourist spots in the state.

 He said initial talks had been held between Peerless and the state government to set up a healthcare centre in Mukutmanipur. 

 We plan to set up a nursing centre here. We hope we will get a concrete proposal from the government within the next six months.

 The resort has 18 air-conditioned cottages scattered on a green plateau with a multi-cuisine restaurant and a 125 KV generator to ensure supply during power cuts, Roy said.

 People can come directly and book the cottages themselves. Alternatively, they can book the cottages in advance in Calcutta through our Peerless Travel Private Limited, said Kenneth Scott, general manager, Peerless Resort.

 During September, the company will offer a double-bed cottage for Rs 850 a day, including breakfast. 

 From October, the usual charge will be Rs 1,100 including breakfast.

 Cong CMs under scrutiny 

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

New Delhi, April 16: The Congress central leadership 

is set to undertake a scrutiny of the performance of its 14 chief ministers ahead 

of a party chief ministers? conference being planned after two years.

 The meet, expected soon after the conclusion of the party?s organisational elections next month, would mark a departure from the earlier such exercises as the leadership reckons that the party?s electoral fortunes would depend more on the actual performance record of the state governments and not really on a good governance campaign.

 The last conclave was held in June 2003 in Srinagar, just six months before the party?s celebrated chief ministers like Digvijay Singh and Ashok Gehlot were swept out of power in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

 ?When we held such meetings in the past and were in the Opposition at the Centre, we highlighted the good governance practices of governments in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan. But that has not yielded desired results. We lost Assembly elections in all these states,? said a party leader.

 According to him, the objective of undertaking a performance assessment is intended to find out shortcomings and take measures to rectify them in time. 

 ?We are only heading a coalition government at the Centre. We cannot hope to improve our position at the national level by merely wresting Opposition-ruled states if we cannot hold on to the states that are currently with us,? he said. For this, a close monitoring of the party-ruled states would be essential, he added.

 Party chief Sonia Gandhi has already set in motion a process of scrutiny with the recent appointment of apex manifesto implementation panels for each of the Congress-ruled states. 

 The panels are empowered to hold review meetings with the chief minister, ministers and state party leaders.

 Though there have been question marks over the continuation of some chief ministers like N.D. Tiwari in Uttaranchal, party treasurer Motilal Vora has virtually ruled out any change of guard before the chief ministers? conclave. 

 However, the performance review could be the basis for considering a leadership change, party sources indicated.

 The Congress has its governments in Pondicherry, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. It heads coalition ministries in Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Meghalaya and Manipur. It is an equal partner in the People?s Democratic Party-led coalition ministry in Jammu and Kashmir.

 Of these, in Kerala and Pondicherry, Assembly elections are due next year. The leadership is concerned about intra-party rumblings in Kerala, Uttaranchal and Punjab.

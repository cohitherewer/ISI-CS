 Pak Mirage from scrap

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 25: Pakistani aeronautics experts have successfully rebuilt at least 20 used Mirage fighter jets that the air force bought from Libya last year.

 The air force had purchased 40 discarded jets to use as a source of spare parts for its own fleet of Mirages. 

 But the experts found at least 20 jets in good condition, which were later rebuilt and upgraded in the Mirage Rebuild Factory located in the countrys premier Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Kamra, south of Islamabad, a PAC official said.

 The air force expects delivery of another 30 Libyan Mirages in the near future.

 We will try to rebuild as many jets as possible for their induction in the Pakistan Air Force when they arrive in Pakistan, the official said.

 In addition to rebuilding Mirages, the PAC is also overhauling the whole range of aircraft in the air forces arsenal. It will start manufacturing JF-17 Thunder aircraft from 2007.

 Jointly produced by Pakistan and China, eight JF-17s will be inducted by the Pakistan Air Force, four each in December 2006 and March 2007.

 The Mirage Rebuild Factory has also recently upgraded the avionics and other sub-systems of more than 40 Mirage aircraft the air force had purchased from Australia in the late 1990s.

 Our experts at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex have successfully upgraded avionics, fire control, beyond visual range and jamming system of the Australian Mirages, giving them a new lease of life, the PAC official said.

 The air force had also procured 40 used Mirages after upgrading their avionics system by SAGEM of France under a $120-million deal in the late 1990s.

 Hurriyat visit

 Leaders of the Hurriyat Conferences moderate faction today decided to visit Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on June 2 and said they wanted to resume talks with the Centre on their return, reports PTI in Srinagar.

 Chairman of the faction Mirwaiz Omar Farooq said the leaders, who have been invited by Islamabad, would meet both the political and militant leaderships.

 The decision to visit Pakistan and PoK was taken at a meeting of the conglomerate here, the Mirwaiz told reporters.

 He expressed hope that the government would follow Pakistans example in extending a formal invitation to the separatist outfit for the next round of talks.

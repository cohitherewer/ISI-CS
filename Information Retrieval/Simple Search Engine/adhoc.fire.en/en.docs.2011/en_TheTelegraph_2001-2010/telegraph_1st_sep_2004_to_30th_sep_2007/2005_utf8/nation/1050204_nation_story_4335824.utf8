 Malls hit Delhi green wall

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: Haryana?s urban dream and environmentalists? nightmare ? mall-studded Gurgaon ? has run into a green hurdle.

 The notification the Union environment ministry issued last July has made it mandatory to seek clearance for construction projects that would cater to 1,000 or more people, discharge 50,000 litres or more sewage a day or involve at least Rs 50 crore in investment.

 It means the 40 proposed complexes on the Mehrauli-Gurgaon stretch that connects the mall heartland to south Delhi would need clearance. Gurgaon already has four malls.

 Gurgaon?s top builders DLF Universal, Unitech and the Ansals have all taken a lead in bagging these commercial sites, but officials said clearances could be hard to get as the infrastructure in the district is poor.

 ?These malls are using diesel generator sets, spewing out huge amounts of sewage and drawing ground water. The development in this area has no regard for the environment,? said Prodipto Ghosh, secretary, Union ministry of environment and forests.

 A master sewerage line in Gurgaon is still not a reality and while internal sewerage lines exist, there is no proper outlet. The sewage is dumped in vacant plots.

 ?Now any new mall coming up in Gurgaon will have to get an environmental clearance,? Ghosh added.

 While the ministry is working out details, officials said state pollution boards might handle the job of examining the clearances.

 Vijay Vancheswar, corporate relations manager, DLF Universal, said: ?The issue of environmental clearances for these malls is still under finalisation. These will depend on the effluent levels, load factors and all these are being formulated according to the locality, the number of visitors they cater to and other factors. The levels have to be more realistic than the ones proposed initially,? he said.

 Of the four malls functioning in Gurgaon, two belong to the DLF group.

 Vancheswar, however, said the high cost of infrastructure in Gurgaon could lead to either the success or failure of the boom as some of the established malls are not getting expected profits. ?Providing infrastructure is extremely crucial as much as professional mall management is,? he said.

 Colonel (Retd) Ratan Singh, of the Gurgaon Residents? Party, a conglomerate of all residents? associations in Gurgaon, said the malls have been planned ?haphazardly?.

 Singh, a candidate in the Assembly elections, said the administration is only interested in making money. ?They have not planned the electricity, water and road requirements ensuring that these are provided according to the number of people pouring into Gurgaon.?

 The Haryana Urban Development Authority is able to provide barely 10 to 20 per cent of the power and water requirement.

 ?It is a condition of the government in the contract for building these malls where it specifies that the builders have to provide for their own water and power,? Singh said.

 ?The trouble is that these malls are running on electricity and power meant for residents.?

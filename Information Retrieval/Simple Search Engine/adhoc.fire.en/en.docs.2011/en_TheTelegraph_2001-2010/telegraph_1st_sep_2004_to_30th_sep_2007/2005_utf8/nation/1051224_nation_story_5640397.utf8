 Salem lie-test signal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 23: A designated Tada court today allowed Mumbai police to conduct scientific tests on extradited don Abu Salem to bolster its investigations.

 Salem will soon be taken to either Hyderabad or Bangalore where he will be subjected to a lie-detector test, brain-mapping and narco-analysis.

 Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam moved the application before judge P.V. Bavkar, seeking the Tada courts permission to conduct the tests.

 Nikam argued that Salem had given certain sensitive information on his network of hawala operations and that the anti-terrorist squad needed to verify his revelations.

 He also told the court that the don had given his consent to undergo the tests.

 Salem, who is believed to possess assets worth Rs 3,000 crore, is likely to be taken to Bangalore for the tests, a senior police officer said.

 Salem has revealed new information about his financial network. We need to verify if he is speaking the truth, he said.

 Asked if the information was specific to Pradeep Jains murder in 1995 or also refers to the 1993 Bombay blasts, the officer said: We are not in a position to reveal that. All we can say is that he has revealed some sensitive information.

 Salem is in the custody of the Mumbai police till January 3 in connection with the murder case.

 Based on the dons revelations, the anti-terrorist squad arrested builder Virendra Jambh late last evening on the charge of abetment in Jains murder case. He was produced before the Tada court today and remanded in police custody till January 3. Jambh had collected the extortion amount from Jains family after the 1995 murder and delivered it to Salem.

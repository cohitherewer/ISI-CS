 Kerala rebel quits RS 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 2: K. Karunakaran, who ended his seven-decade association with the Congress by forming a new outfit yesterday, has resigned from the Rajya Sabha.

 Karunakaran said here today that Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat had accepted his resignation. He was elected to the upper House last year.

 The election to the vacant seat is likely within the next two months. The ruling Congress-led coalition has the support of 99 members in the 140-member Kerala Assembly and it is they who will choose Karunakaran?s replacement. 

 One section in the state party wants the seat to go to Karunakaran?s daughter, Padmaja Venugopal, who is still with the Congress. But another believes that the apparent family discord is Karunakaran?s ploy to ensure the political future of his children, whichever party they are in.

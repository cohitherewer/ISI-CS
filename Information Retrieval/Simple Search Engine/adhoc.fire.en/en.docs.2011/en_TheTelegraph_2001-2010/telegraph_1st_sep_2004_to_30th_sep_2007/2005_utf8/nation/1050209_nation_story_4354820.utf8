 Naveen graft case in court 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 8: Former inspector-general of police Surendranath Swain today lodged a corruption case against chief minister Naveen Patnaik, a cabinet colleague and senior bureaucrats in a city vigilance court.

 On January 24, Swain caused a flutter by lodging a complaint with Capital police station against Patnaik, urban development minister K.V. Singhdeo and senior bureaucrats S.P. Nanda and Hrusikesh Panda in the Tangarpada mines case. 

 However, the police did not file an FIR as the matter was sub judice, following which Swain decided to move court.

 In his petition before the special judge (vigilance) Manoranjan Patnaik, Swain has sought the prosecution of the accused under Section 15 of Prevention of Corruption Act and Sections 409, 511, 120(B) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

 Singhdeo was the industries minister in 2002 when the joint venture between the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation of Orissa Limited and Jindal Strips was signed to explore the chromite mines at Tangarpada. 

 Showing little trust in the state police, Swain said, ?They are non-committal?in the past fortnight, they have not given me any reply.?

 Reacting to the development, the ruling BJD said Swain himself should first ?come clean?.

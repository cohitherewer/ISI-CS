 No rent precedent but case for rule

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, April 21: The Supreme Court judgment increasing the rent paid by a firm occupying prime space in the BBD Bag area while eviction proceedings were going on will not set a legal precedent, lawyers said.

 But it does establish the case for setting rent at market rates until an eviction process is settled. 

 Lawyers said the Supreme Court applied Section 141 of the Constitution while hearing the appeal against the decree of eviction passed by Calcutta High Court against Anderson Wright and Company. It fixed the monthly compensation at Rs 85,170 in place of Rs 853 the firm has been paying as rent since 1939.

 A sitting judge of Calcutta High Court explained that under Section 141, the court has the right to fix compensation, which is known in legalese as ?mean profit?, if the tenant is found to be enjoying the premises at a very low rent. 

 ?All pending or future cases cannot be addressed with this section in view,? the judge said.

 Another sitting judge agreed with this view. ?It is the duty of the court to fix a mean profit after an eviction decree has been passed in favour of the house-owner,? he said.

 Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, a well-known lawyer who has been advocate-general of Tripura, said more than 15,000 such cases were awaiting disposal in Bengal.

 ?The question of precedence does not arise. The judgment followed the normal course. In the present case, the house-owner had already obtained an eviction decree from the court and become eligible for mean profit till the execution of the decree,? explained Gitanath Ganguly, also a lawyer.

 He said in the present case, the court had fixed a high compensation as the tenant was enjoying the premises at a low rate for nearly 70 years. ?This judgment will not be a precedent as this is not a new law of the land,? Ganguly added. 

 Amar Mitra, president of the All Calcutta House Owners? Association, admitted that the judgment did not set a precedent, nor will it have a fallout on other similar cases. ?But it shows that the apex court wants rents to be rational and in tandem with market rates,? Mitra said.

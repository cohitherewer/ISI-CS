 Wives plug Karachi gap

 GAUTAM DATT

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: If an office problem proves a tough nut, look no further than home for the answer. At least, if you have the ingenuity of Indias newly appointed consul-general in Karachi.

 Short-staffed and facing a flood of visa applications, Navdeep Suri has drafted in the wives of his employees to help out.

 Thanks to an overcautious Islamabad, the consulates staff has been reduced to 20 ? about a fourth of its strength before the office was shut down during a diplomatic standoff in 1994. They include officers as well as support staff.

 The Indian High Commission in Pakistan, however, processes around 10,000 visas every month and 70 per cent of the applications come from Karachi.

 So IFS officer Suri, named consul-general last month, was expecting to be snowed under when the office reopened on January 2 ? till he had his brainwave.

 His entire staff, including the wives of six employees selected by Suri, will begin training from Monday on a computerised visa protocol system developed by the National Informatics Centre. 

 The consul-general is known to bring imagination into his work. When he was posted in Washington over a decade ago, he created a database for non-resident Indians who were making significant financial contributions to political parties. The move sowed the seeds for the birth of the now influential Indian Caucus.

 In 1994, Islamabad had asked Delhi to close its Karachi consulate and India, in a tit-for-tat measure, got the Pakistani consulate in Mumbai shut down. Both are to reopen on January 2, 2006.

 But the staff shortage was not the only hitch. Finding the office premises proved tough, too. The property chosen by the Indian commission had squatters who were removed after court intervention. 

 The Pakistani side, too, is having its share of problems. The move to reopen its consulate at Mumbais Nariman Point has run into trouble with the neighbourhood residents welfare association. It isnt clear if the office will be ready to open on January 2.

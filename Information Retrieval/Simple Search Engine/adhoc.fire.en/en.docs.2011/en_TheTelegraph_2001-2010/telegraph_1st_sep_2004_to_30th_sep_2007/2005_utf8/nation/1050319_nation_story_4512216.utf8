 Zarin misses friend

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 March 18: When Begum Zarin Musharraf toured Aligarh Muslim University today, she missed Shahnaz Hashmi, a friend and relative who was murdered in her apartment a month ago.

 Shahnaz, a retired reader in the department of English, used to live alone in Nishat Apartments in the university area. 

 Three servants confessed to strangling her after they were tracked down. Instead of riches, they found only books ? a collection of Jane Austen?s works was among her favourites ? and a scrapbook on Princess Diana, whose life she followed closely.

 Sources close to the Musharrafs said one of the reasons for Zarin?s visit to India was to condole Shahnaz?s death. Shahnaz was the sister-in-law of the late Qazi Moizuddin Ahmad, a cousin of Pervez Musharraf?s father.

 Zarin told her relatives today she ?terribly missed? Shahnaz who had taken her around the university when she visited Aligarh for the wedding of Ahmad?s daughter Fauzia in 1982.

 The two sides have been in touch for several generations through telephone and email. 

 Pervez Musharraf himself extended an open invitation to his Indian relatives to visit him in Pakistan. The relatives living in Delhi, Lucknow, Aligarh and the UAE are keen to do so but would prefer further normalisation of India?s ties with Pakistan before they visit the Pindi Army House or Islamabad?s presidential palace.

 Before leaving for Aligarh last evening, Zarin had called up Shahnaz?s elder sister Khaleda, who was married to Ahmad, in Faridabad. The old bond was quickly revived. Zarin said she wanted to call on them but could not because of security reasons. The Ahmads have been invited to meet her at the Pakistan high commissioner?s residence tomorrow evening.

 Zarin has been wondering why her visit has been linked to cricket by the media. She was amused by news reports that claimed her presence at Mohali. An avid reader, she has asked her relatives to keep copies of these news reports, saying she wants to read them all.

 India cold to Kasuri offer

 New Delhi, March 24 (PTI): Pakistan today said it was ready to pull out troops from the Siachen glacier, a remark dubbed as ?nothing new? by India. 

 Delhi maintained that there could be no movement unless Islamabad ?authenticated the present positions?.

 Pakistan also described the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service as the ?most significant? confidence-building measure after the ceasefire on the Line of Control announced in November 2002, a view shared by New Delhi, which hoped the ?intended purpose? of the link would be served.

 ?We are prepared to do it (withdraw troops) tomorrow,? Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said in an interview to a news channel.

 Kasuri claimed ?there was already an agreement between the governments of India and Pakistan?. Let?s implement it tomorrow?. There was an agreement years ago?.

 The foreign minister denied there was any resistance from Islamabad on troop withdrawal from Siachen, the world?s highest battlefield.

 India dubbed Kasuris remark on siachen as ?nothing new?.

 Pakistan has been refusing to ?authenticate present positions? of defence forces of the respective country and without that there could be no movement on the issue, official sources said here reacting to the statement.

 External affairs ministry spokesman navtej sarna told reporters ?siachen is an issue in the composite dialogue. It is a matter under discussion between defence secretaries of the two countries under composite dialogue. First round of the composite dialogue has been completed.?

 He refused to comment further. (more) pti akk msa pp 03242106 del 

 on the srinagar-muzaffarabad bus service to be launched on april 7, kasuri said it was the ?most significant cbm? since the ceasefire between the two countries.

 ?Once kashmiris start meeting, they will exchange stories... They will be curious. Then they will think of their future and then there can be possible solutions,? he said.

 External affairs ministry spokesman navtej sarna said ?it is a very important cbm.?

 ?India had proposed it as far back as october 2002. We are certainly hopeful that it will serve the purpose that it is intended to,? sarna said.

 The service, to be flagged off by prime minister manmohan singh along with upa chairperson sonia gandhi, is aimed at helping families of jammu and kashmir divided by the line of control (loc) to meet after 58 years.

 New delhi attaches immense importance to the launch of the service which is reflected by the fact that it will be flagged off by the prime minister who will be joined by gandhi.

 Denying arms race with india, kasuri said pakistan always aimed at a certain level of deterrence and ?we have succeeded in it... We are not going to compete with india.?

 He said a political decision had been taken in pakistan to have peace with india and ?we are not thinking of using nuclear weapons..., therefore, we should have a conventional balance.

 ?We cannot compete with india but what we can do, if we got our wits about ourselves, is to always maintain a certain balance keeping (in view) our economic conditions,? he said. Pti akk msa pp 03242335 del

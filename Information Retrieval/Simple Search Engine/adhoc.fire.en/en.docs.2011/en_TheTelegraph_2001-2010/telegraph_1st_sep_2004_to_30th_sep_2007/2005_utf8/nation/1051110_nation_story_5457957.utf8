 Aman Setu (LoC, Uri), Nov. 9: India and Pakistan reopened a second point on the Line of Control today ? and again declared it a symbolic beginning as the frontier still stayed closed to vital relief trucks and people.

 With the Aman Setu (Friendship Bridge) having crumbled in the October 8 earthquake, a group of about 10 porters from each side carried almost identical, small batches of relief across the line along a makeshift footpath on the dried bed of the KDK Nullah.

 People from divided families desperate to meet their relatives on the other side had another disappointing day. A group of 35 Indian Kashmiris were prevented from going across despite their travel documents having been cleared by both countries authorities.

 We had made all the necessary preparations, including transport, for todays passengers to Muzaffarabad. But we were told at the last moment by the Pakistan authorities that the road on their side of the border was still in total disuse, a senior police officer said here.

 We shall take a few more days to rebuild the road on our side. After that the two countries can decide on allowing members of the divided families to join each other, Lt Colonel Chirag-ud-Din of the Pakistan Army told reporters.

 The UN wants to see the ceasefire line opened also to aid trucks that could save thousands of lives in remote mountain villages on the Pakistani side, but the two countries are yet to agree to this.

 Aid officials have warned that with winter approaching, thousands of survivors without shelter could die. Funds are also running short while acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, dysentery and tetanus are spreading.

 It will make a huge difference if we can just truck stuff straight in from the Indian side rather than having to rely on fresh transport on the Pakistani side, which is in very limited supply, and offloading and onloading at the border, said World Food Programme spokesman Robin Lodge.

 But army and civil officials emphasised the symbolic nature of the LoC openings as they shook hands and posed for photographs before their countries began exchanging supplies of blankets, food, tents and medicines.

 The concept is to restore confidence, Chirag-ud-Din said. It is a step towards the right direction.

 Pakistan Kashmir relief commissioner Shafeeq Ahmad Kiani echoed him: It is a symbolic beginning. The process shall continue and pick up in the days to come.

 When the Chakan da Bagh-Titrinote point was opened on Monday, many Pakistan Kashmiris had made a dash for Indian soil, prompting Pakistani police to first cane them, and then fire teargas shells and shots in the air to stop them.

 Today, an Indian doctor helping the relief effort spotted his cousin on the other side of the bridge but could not meet him. I could not hug him or talk to him, Sajad Shafi said. They stopped us. We want these lines to be withdrawn so that we can meet our relatives.

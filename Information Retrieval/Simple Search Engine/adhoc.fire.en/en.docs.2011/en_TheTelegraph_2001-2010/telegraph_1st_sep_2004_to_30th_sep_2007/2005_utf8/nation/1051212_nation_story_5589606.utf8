 Dharam for Bengaluru

 Gulbarga, Dec. 11 (PTI): Bangalore could be called Ben-galuru, as pronounced in Kannada.

 Chief minister Dharam Singh said today that he had asked the chief secretary to take steps to this effect. He said Kannadigas were calling it Bengaluru but outsiders knew the city by its anglicised name, Bangalore. 

 Singh said the suggestion had emanated at a recent meeting of Kannada litterateurs, which was called to discuss steps to celebrate the golden jubilee of the formation of the state of Karnataka. He would also urge the Prime Minister to accord Kannada classical status, Singh said.

 Valley salute to army

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Jan. 25: Jammu and Kashmir has recorded a 24-per cent reduction in violence in the past year, the governor said in his message on the eve of Republic Day.

 Lt. Gen. (Retd) S.K. Sinha said militancy-related killings had come down from ?2,542 in 2003 to 1,810 in 2004?. In a speech that liberally praised securitymen for the reduction in violence, Sinha claimed that the jawans had succeeded in eliminating over 50 top militants.

 He admitted that ?the state continues to be mired in the dark tunnel of violence, with 39,000 lives being lost in the past 15 years?? but expressed hope that the 750-km border fencing ?will bring about peace and security?.

 He described this fencing as the great success story of 2004 and praised retiring army chief General N.C. Vij, a Jammu and Kashmir native, ?for his brilliant conception and dynamic execution of the border project?.

 ?I would like to call this defence line the Vij Line,? Sinha said, adding that the fenced border has already yielded promising results.

 Reeling out more figures, he said: ?Infiltration in 2004 was down by two-third from the figure of 2003, even when for more than half the year, the fencing was not complete. During the last three months, after completion of the fencing, infiltration came down to near zero and the army has been achieving the most commendable success in foiling attempts of militants to breach the fence.?

 He expressed hope that infiltration would be kept at the zero level in future and the ?choking effect will be felt on terrorism in the hinterland, as the stocks of arms (of the militants) gets exhausted or busted?.

 The governor noted that, unlike forces carrying out operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Waziristan or Baluchistan, the Indian Army has never used artillery, helicopter gunships or fighter aircraft in the last 15 years in this state as ?these weapons cause widespread casualties and damage?. Nor has the army ever damaged a mosque, he said, then added, ?of course, there have been a few isolated and unfortunate incidents over the last 15 years?.

 Sinha said of ?some 1,300 complaints of alleged human rights violations? received and investigated, ?only 30 were found true, the remaining were false?. ?In these 30 incidents, some 70 army personnel found guilty were punished with dismissal and given sentences of imprisonment up to 12 years.?

 Anthem order on hold

 New Delhi, April 27: The Supreme Court today reserved its judgment on a petition seeking deletion of the word ?Sindh? from the national anthem, reports our legal correspondent.

 The petition by Sanjeev Bhatnagar argued that the province was no more a part of India. So retaining Sindh in Jana gana mana amounted to violating the sovereignty of Pakistan.

 The Centre has contended that the word cannot be deleted as it would ?destroy? the anthem?s unique ?cultural sense?.

 IA dangles 16-ticket bait

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Indian Airlines announced a marketing drive targeting commercial travellers by bundling 16 flight tickets for Rs 65,000 even as its operations to the Northeast were hit by a pilots? strike.

 Its new scheme, dubbed ?bumper super saver?, gives passengers 16 single-sector coupons which can be converted into confirmed tickets.

 Airline officials clarified that travellers would be treated like ?any other normal economy class passengers and will not be the first to be offloaded in case seats are overbooked?.

 The scheme, which does not require advance purchase or any other booking condition, will be launched tomorrow. 

 The tickets would be valid for one year from the date of issue.

 A coupon, which would cost on an average a little over Rs 4,000, can be used for any domestic destination, barring four sectors where two coupons would be required for a single flight.

 These sectors are Delhi to Kochi, Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram and Coimbatore and vice versa.

 As the state-run airline tried to push up its market share, its subsidiary Alliance Air that operates flights to the Northeast ran into trouble today. Alliance Air had its flights disrupted as the pilots, all of whom are on contract, stayed away from work demanding higher allowances.

 The 20 ATR aircraft pilots comprised nine commanders and 11 co-pilots.

 ?Discussions are on. We have already spoken to them and they have sought some time to come back to us,? said Shekhar Ghose, IA?s director, east.

 The airline was forced to draw on its Airbus fleet to run some of the flights while those to Aizawl and Silchar were cancelled.

 Top IA officials have been rushed down to Calcutta to help Ghose negotiate an end to the wildcat strike.

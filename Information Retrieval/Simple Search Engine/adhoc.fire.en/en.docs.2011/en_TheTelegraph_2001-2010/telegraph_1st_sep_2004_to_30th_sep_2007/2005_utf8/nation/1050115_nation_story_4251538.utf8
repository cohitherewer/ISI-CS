 Govt bid to clear name 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 14: Under pressure from the Opposition, the Orissa government has said in an official release that the two-member central probe team has not made any adverse remark against the state in its report.

 In fact, the release said, the team has acknowledged in the report that the government has issued showcause notices to Vedanta Alumina whenever the company seemed to violate forest norms.

 Taking note of the objections raised against mining activities in the Niyamagiri hills, the release said the decision to mine bauxite from Lanjigarh and Karlapat mines was taken way back in 1997. 

 The Niyamgiri reserve forest is spread over than 9,000 hectares. Of this, less than 400 hectares would be required for bauxite mining and the refinery, the release claimed. 

 A comprehensive management plan is being prepared to find solutions to the possible adverse impact of mining and industries on the environment, the release said. No mining activity would be taken up until this management plan is approved by the Centre. It also stated that the forest diversion proposal for the mines is under preparation.

 The government will give due weightage to recommendations of the team on the rehabilitation of displaced persons, the release said.

 FARID HOSSAIN 

 Dhaka, May 27: Bangladeshs special security force today gunned down five suspected Indian militants and their Bangladeshi aide during a crackdown on a border village in the countrys northeast.

 The Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) confirmed the killings at Puranbari village in Moulvibazar district that shares the border with Assam. 

 It, however, did not give any details of the dead.

 In a press release, the special security force said its troops arrested three Indians from the scene of the shootout. They were identified as Sunil Dev Barman and Hamir Dev Barman from Tripura and Maira Dev Barman from Manipur.

 According to BD News, a news agency, the RAB raided a den of suspected Indian insurgents in Puranbari and traded fire. An RAB officer, who was wounded, was flown by a helicopter to Dhaka, it added. 

 Another news agency, United News of Bangladesh, said all the six killed were suspected to be Indian rebels. 

 The Bangladesh Rifles lent muscle to the RAB raid. RAB and BDR forces, acting on a tip-off, raided a house at Puranbari in Moulvibazar district. Sensing the presence of BDR and RAB forces, the terrorists opened fire on them and BDR and RAB retaliated, leaving six terrorists dead, read an RAB press release.

 About 50 rounds of gunshots were exchanged, it said, adding that the forces arrested seven more suspected Indian rebels from four other bordering areas ? Sreemongol, Kulaura, Jhenaighati and Sherpur.

 Cop concern for elections

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Jan. 11: Gaya will go to the polls in the first phase on February 3 but the district ? where nine of the 10 Assembly segments have a formidable presence of Naxalites ? does not have enough policemen to deal with the red challenge.

 According to superintendent of police Sanjay Singh, 21,311 constables are required for the safe conduct of the Assembly elections in 2,313 polling booths in the district. But the district has only 1,700 constables, way below the requirement.

 The authorities might deploy around 2,500 homeguards to compensate for the dearth of constables, but even that would be inadequate. Besides the inadequacy of policemen, district officials also have to cope with the shortage of poll personnel in the wake of the non-gazetted government employees? strike.

 According to district magistrate Chaitanya Prasad, a minimum of 11,038 personnel would be required to conduct the elections. However, only 2,068 central government employees and 4,243 schoolteachers are available for election duty. 

 In a bid to cope with the personnel problem, the Election Commission has directed district officials to compile a list of employees of CBSE-affiliated schools and colleges affiliated to Magadh University. 

 But deploying college employees may not prove effective. Since most degree colleges of the district are managed by politicians, questions could be raised on the impartiality of the employees in the conduct of elections.

 One such college is run by a sitting MLA of the district, while a CPI leader, who, has contested Assembly elections, is the president of the governing body of another. 

 Besides, a CBSE-affiliated school is run by the family members of a senior Janata Dal (United) leader and former MP. 

 Conducting elections in Gaya has always been a challenge for district magistrates. Between 1995 and 2004, three of them were debarred from handling poll-related work. During the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, then district magistrate S.M. Raju was suspended. 

 Violence has also been a part of elections in Gaya. In 1991, then sitting MP Ishwar Chaudhary was assassinated during the campaign, while poll personnel were killed during the 1998 Lok Sabha elections and 2003 Assembly bypolls.

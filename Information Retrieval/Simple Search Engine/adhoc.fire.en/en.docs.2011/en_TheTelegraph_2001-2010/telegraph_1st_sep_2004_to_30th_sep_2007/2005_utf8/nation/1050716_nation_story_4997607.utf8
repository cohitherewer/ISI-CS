 Mastermind with two faces

 New Delhi, July 15: The intelligence agencies have got the name but not yet pinpointed the man.

 The mastermind of the Ayodhya attack is called Qari Saifullah and he is a commander with a Kashmiri militant group, the sleuths say.

 The problem is, the description and the name fit two persons. One Qari Saifullah is the divisional commander of the Lashkar-e-Toiba in south Kashmir; the other is the divisional commander of the Jaish-e-Mohammed in Mendhar, Poonch. We are trying to identify which of them is our man, an intelligence official said.

 The police bosses of Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir have announced that the Ayodhya strike was carried out by the Lashkar. According to them, the five suicide attackers, their sixth accomplice and their links in Poonch were all Lashkar men.

 But the five arrests made after a joint operation today ? by the Uttar Pradesh polices special task force and Jammu and Kashmir police ? have raised questions about that theory.

 All the five suspected links of the Ayodhya attackers were picked up in Mendhar. This suggests that it was the Jaish-e-Mohammeds Qari Saifullah who masterminded the attack.

 The sleuths say there is another possibility: that the two groups have joined forces. They suggest the Lashkar may have carried out the Ayodhya attack using Jaish recruits to carry the weapons from Mendhar to Panipat, where these were handed to the Lashkar fidayeen unit that had come over from Delhi. It was this unit that struck at Ayodhya.

 There are some missing links and unanswered questions in what is being said by the Jammu and Kashmir police and the STF, an intelligence source said.

 With the intelligence agencies hot on their heels, both Lashkar and Jaish have turned their wireless sets off and restricted their movements since yesterday, a source said.

 The last important call recorded was four days ago. The message said, Kaam to achha hua lekin chook ho gai (the work was done well but for a little mistake).

 The Ayodhya attackers were gunned down before they could reach or hit the target ? the makeshift Ram temple in the Ayodhya complex.

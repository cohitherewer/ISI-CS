 Left tells Bihar to take Centre path

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The CPM today said the Bihar governor should invite the single largest party in a hung Assembly to form the government, and rejected the idea of central rule in the state.

 The party said the governor should remember the precedent that former Presidents set by inviting the single largest party to form a government at the Centre.

 CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said it would be wrong to have President?s rule ? as suggested by Ram Vilas Paswan in the event of a hung Assembly ? immediately after elections as it would flout the democratic spirit.

 ?The people?s verdict is not an endorsement of the communal platform though the RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal) has also been cut to size. Despite that, the fact that so many people voted to make the RJD the single largest party reflects its mass base,? said Yechury, suggesting an invitation to Laloo Prasad Yadav?s party.

 Yechury, CPI?s D. Raja, Forward Bloc?s Debabrata Biswas and RSP?s Abani Roy separately asked the RJD, the Congress and Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party ? all allies at the Centre ? to work together towards the formation of a secular state government.

 Yechury said Paswan had already clarified in public that he would not join hands with the BJP-Janta Dal (United) combine.

 ?It (LJP) is part of the UPA at the Centre. All-out efforts should be made by all UPA partners to form a secular government in the state,? Raja said while observing that a secular government?s formation primarily depended on Paswan?s party.

 Yechury replied in the negative when asked whether the Bihar results and the ensuing political manoeuvring would affect the UPA government. He pointed out that the RJD and the LJP had fought the last elections together.

 Asked who was to blame for the UPA?s ?disunity? in Bihar, the CPM leader said it would be wrong to apportion blame at this juncture.

 ?The Congress decision of unilaterally announcing its alliance with the JMM in Jharkhand had sparked off the rift (with the RJD). It should have taken more care as it heads the UPA coalition,? Yechury said.

 ?Had they accepted our persuasion, then all UPA partners would have fought the elections together,? he said when asked about the Left?s role now.

 The combined strength of the Left parties, including the CPI-ML, would now be of help in a secular regime?s formation, he added.

 The RJD, the Congress and the LJP should sit together and sort out differences, Yechury said.

 An upbeat Forward Bloc, which won two seats in Jharkhand, and the RSP, which did not contest at all, gave the same advice to the three UPA partners.

 Biswas said the Left parties should have unitedly contested the elections and achieved better results. Roy said his party had written to ideological cousins on the need for Left unity.

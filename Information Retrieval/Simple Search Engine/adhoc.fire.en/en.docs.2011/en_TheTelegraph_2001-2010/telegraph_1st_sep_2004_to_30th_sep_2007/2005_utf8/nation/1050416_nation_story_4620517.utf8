 Nepal king seeks date with PM in Jakarta

 PRANAY SHARMA AND J. HEMANTH

 April 15: Nepal?s King Gyanendra is believed to have asked for a date with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of a multilateral meet in Jakarta later this month.

 The monarch, under growing pressure from the international community to restore democracy in Nepal, also met the Indian ambassador, Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, today after keeping his request pending for nearly two months.

 India had severely criticised the king?s dismissal of the Sher Bahadur Deuba government on February 1 and the imposition of emergency in that country. Since then, Delhi had also suspended supply of military hardware.

 Sources said the decision to meet Mukherjee ? the only one kept waiting by the king who had meetings with the American and European envoys ? could be by way of doing the groundwork to look up Singh on the sidelines of the Afro-Asian summit from April 20 to 24.

 India has yet to decide if such a meeting will take place.

 At today?s meeting with the king, Mukherjee is believed to have reiterated that democracy be immediately restored, political prisoners freed and media censorship lifted. 

 Recently, Gyanendra had freed prominent party leaders and announced that municipal polls will be held.

 However, Nepal?s political parties today rejected his declaration to hold the elections, making it clear they were meaningless in the absence of political freedom.

 ?Free and fair elections are impossible at a time when the entire country and its people are kept under captivity,? Nepali Congress leader Girija Prasad Koirala was quoted by agencies as having said.

 India maintains that constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy are the two pillars on which Nepal?s stability and progress depend. It is keen that Gyanendra irons out differences with the parties so that a united fight can be put up against the Maoist rebels.

 The king?s main worry seems to stem from the growing global pressure, particularly the recent developments at the United Nations Human Rights Conference in Geneva. At the meet, the king?s methods came in for severe flak, particularly his handling of the human rights situation.

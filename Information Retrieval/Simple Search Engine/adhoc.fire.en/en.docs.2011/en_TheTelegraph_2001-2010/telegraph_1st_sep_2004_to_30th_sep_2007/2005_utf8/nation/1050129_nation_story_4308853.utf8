 Mesco rolls out hot metal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 28: Mid-East Integrated Steels Ltd (Mesco), the company owned by controversial couple J.K. Singh and Rita Singh, has started its hot metal production with the formal commissioning of its first blast furnace, Satya, in Jajpur district yesterday.

 Though started in 1992 at Kalinga Nagar area of Duburi in Jajpur district as a 100 per cent export-oriented unit in collaboration with Chinese company China Metallurgical Equipment Corporation, the proposed 1.5-million tonne steel plant suffered a serious setback after its promoters failed to tie up necessary funds. 

 The project ran into rough weather after the Singh couple was accused of swindling the Orissa government. 

 In October last year, CBI issued a chargesheet to the chairman and two directors of Mesco accusing them of cheating the state government to the tune of Rs 27 crore by pledging fake shares as security. Mired in controversy, the plant had been written off by many till the UK-based trading house Stemcor stepped in to provide the necessary funds for commissioning the project and buy its entire produce for the next 10 years. Stemcor has so far provided Rs 56 crore for the project. According to the agreement, Stemcor will provide or arrange funds for commissioning of the plant in phases.

 It will also supply coke at the prevailing international prices for 10 years and buy the total products of the Mesco plant. The UK-based MNC will also make available the letter of credit of $ 100 million at any point of time to meet the raw material requirement for two blast furnaces.

 Stemcor chairman Ralph Openheimer said the products of the MISL plant would be exported while some portions would be sold in the domestic market according to the export oriented unit norms. 

 He added that the details of funding would be finalised after a discussion with the Mesco management after the field visit. Though the company plans to make integrated steel, it would manufacture pig iron for the time being as it does not have the necessary expertise to make steel, said MISL chairman J.K. Singh.

 Singh said an estimated Rs 100 crore was required to run the two blast furnaces and two sinter plants.

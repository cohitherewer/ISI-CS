 Belligerent Nagas in no-tax cry

 KHELEN THOKCHOM

 Imphal, Nov. 6: Crossing the thin red line between persuasion and provocation, Nagas of Manipur have decided to stop paying tax to the state government and start renaming hill ranges, rivers, villages and districts in a bid to press for the integration of their strongholds with Nagaland. 

 Both decisions are part of a set of resolutions adopted by the influential United Naga Council (UNC), the apex organisation of Nagas living in Manipur, during a meeting in Senapati district on Friday, a source said.

 The announcement came a day after NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah threatened to call off his organisations talks with Delhi and order his armed men to return to the jungles if a final political settlement was not reached before another term of the ceasefire ends next year.

 Taking the cue, the UNC, too, said the Naga community of Manipur would stop accepting any funds for schemes taken up by the government with effect from April 1 next year. Besides, it said, the Nagas would dissociate themselves from any forum or organisation belonging to the Meiteis.

 Of the three states apart from Nagaland to have Naga-inhabited areas, Manipur has been the staunchest opponent of integration.

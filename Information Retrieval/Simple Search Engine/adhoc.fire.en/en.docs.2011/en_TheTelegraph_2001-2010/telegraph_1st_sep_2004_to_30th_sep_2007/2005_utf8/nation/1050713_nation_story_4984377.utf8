 Mallika to seek ban on smut clip

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 12: Mallika Sherawat will petition Bombay High Court tomorrow demanding a ban on an MMS (multi-media message service) clip showing a woman resembling her engaged in explicit sex.

 The actors lawyer, Vibhav Krishna, told reporters today he would request the court to prevent the clip from being aired on television, Internet or any other medium.

 Sherawat has denied that the woman in the clip is her, and has filed a complaint with police. 

 The six-to-eight-minute clip shows a woman having sex with an unidentified white man while a song from Mallikas hit film Murder plays in the background. 

 The clip is believed to be shot at Cannes where Sherawat attended the premiere of her new movie with Jackie Chan.

 Many see this as a publicity stunt by the actor both of whose recent releases have bombed at the box-office. 

 Mukesh Bhatt, producer brother of film-maker Mahesh Bhatt, said he believed the woman in the clip is Mallika. There are a combination of shots of her and the man ? how could these be morphed? Plus, I am sure she knew she was being filmed. How else could there be such close-ups? Bhatt said.

 Sherawat shot to fame as a sex symbol by portraying 17 kisses in her second film, Khwaaish. 

 Her next film, Murder, directed by Mahesh Bhatt, turned out to be a box-office hit. Sherawat then acted in Jackie Chans new movie and travelled to Cannes International Film Festival earlier this year.

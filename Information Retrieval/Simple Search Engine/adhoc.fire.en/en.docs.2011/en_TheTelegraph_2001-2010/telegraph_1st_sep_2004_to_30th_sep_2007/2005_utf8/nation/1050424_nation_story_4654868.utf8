 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Sanjay Dutt: Real sequel

 Lucknow, April 23: Munnabhai MBBS has spawned a sequel in Meerut.

 Two real-life Munnabhais landed in the police station yesterday for trying to fake their way into a postgraduate course for surgery in Lucknow?s King George Medical College. 

 Prakash Rajput and Rakesh Kumar, both medical graduates like the do-gooder don played by Sanjay Dutt in the film Munnabhai MBBS, were caught red-handed by invigilators at a counselling session at Meerut Medical College.

 In the film, Munnabhai cheats at entry-level and subsequently yearly exams to become a doctor but chooses to cure patients by hugs. 

 Rajput and Kumar, graduates from Lucknow Medical College, had appeared for the postgraduate medical entrance examination earlier this month and were ranked 10th and 17th among the 303 selected from a total of 1,000 candidates who sat for the tests.

 But their luck ran out when the duo, who had opted for surgery, put their thumb impressions with a micro-plastic sheet on their thumb. When the invigilators caught them, they tried to swallow the plastic sheets.

 Rajput is from Lucknow and Kumar is from Varanasi.

 It is suspected the two ?academically brilliant candidates? managed such high ranks by hiring dummy examinees. 

 ?It was a neat operation of paper manipulation by the ?Munnabhais? who hired bright postgraduate doctors to appear for the entrance examinations,? a senior doctor said, adding that such candidates manufacture alternative admit cards complete with photographs of the hired doctors.

 To prevent such manipulation, the postgraduate medical council has introduced the system of taking thumb impressions of each candidate, both at the written entrance test and the counselling session. 

 ?We suspect the two MBBS doctors used micro-plastic sheets to hide their thumb impressions because the hired doctors who actually appeared for the entrance test might have used the micro-plastic sheets, too, before sitting for the test on their behalf,? said Dr Kamal Sahani, director of medical education, government of Uttar Pradesh.

 Sources said dummy candidates, who are senior doctors, are available for anything between Rs 2,000 and Rs 50,000 per paper.

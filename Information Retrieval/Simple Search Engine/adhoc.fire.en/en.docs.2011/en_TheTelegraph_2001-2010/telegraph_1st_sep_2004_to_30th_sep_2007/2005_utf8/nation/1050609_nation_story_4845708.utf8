 Visit suspense

 L.K. Advani is scheduled to visit Gandhinagar ? his constituency and a stronghold of the VHP ? on Thursday to inaugurate an electrification programme. 

 Officials were unable to confirm whether Advani will be able to make it because of the crisis. Asked whether there would be protests if Advani keeps his date, VHP leader Praveen Togadia said: They (parishad supporters) will decide tomorrow.

 WHO rap for mind study

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: In the year after the tsunami, health workers in relief camps across Southeast Asia have detected and successfully controlled 106 diseases that could have flared into outbreaks, the World Health Organisation said today.

 But, it added, a proposal to evaluate psychological distress in survivors failed to make much headway in India and Sri Lanka as it was down on the priority list of local mental health professionals.

 The absence of any disease outbreak showed the effectiveness of surveillance and early warning, said Samlee Plianbangchang, the director of the WHOs Southeast Asia regional office.

 Over the past 12 months, community health workers and public health systems in the region have logged 106 disease alerts, including 14 for jaundice, 10 for dengue haemorrhagic fever and 17 for diarrhoea. In each case, the health workers treated and isolated patients or distributed bednets.

 But inadequate efforts to evaluate mental health among victims in India and Sri Lanka led to a gaping hole in their efforts in the two countries.

 A proper study would have told health workers who needs a kind word, who needs a counsellor and who needs a psychiatrist, said Dr Vijay Chandra, adviser on mental health at the WHOs Southeast Asia regional office.

 It would thus have facilitated more effective distribution of psychosocial services.

 Chandra said the WHO had strongly advocated the use of a time-tested tool called general health questionnaire that takes only 15 minutes to evaluate the psychosocial state of an individual.

 Thailand is the only tsunami-affected country that has used the tool on thousands of its affected population. Maldives is engaged in a similar exercise now. But India and Sri Lanka havent done it, the WHO adviser said.

 An Indian mental health professional, however, countered that claim, saying the Indian Council of Medical Research has been supporting a psychological health evaluation project in four tsunami-affected districts in the country.

 He said the WHOs comments reflect an unwillingness to acknowledge the activity that is underway. 

 We have used the general health questionnaire and already covered 800 people in Chennai, Cuddalore, Kanyakumari and Nagapattinam, said Dr Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Behavioural and Allied Sciences in Delhi, the principal investigator of the project.

 The evaluation showed that 33 to 40 per cent of those affected showed some sign of psychosocial distress even eight months after the disaster.

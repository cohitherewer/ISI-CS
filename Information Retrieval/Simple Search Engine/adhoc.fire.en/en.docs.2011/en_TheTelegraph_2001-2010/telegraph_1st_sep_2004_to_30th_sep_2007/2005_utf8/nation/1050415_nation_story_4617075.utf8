 Riot cop plea draws govt fire

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, April 14: A Gujarat top cop challenged his supercession before the Central Administrative Tribunal, drawing a sharp reaction from the state government today.

 R.B. Sreekumar, additional director-general of police, alleged in his petition filed yesterday that chief minister Narendra Modi and senior bureaucrats had ordered the ?elimination? of minorities during the post-Godhra riots.

 He further alleged that Modi himself issued instructions to tap the phones of certain Muslim police officers and of Shankersinh Vaghela and late BJP leader Haren Pandya.

 ?The allegations made against Modi are politically motivated and also a reflection of the official?s frustration (on not getting a promotion),? minister of state for home Amit Shah said in a statement here.

 Sreekumar was superceded by K.R. Kaushik, the Ahmedabad police commissioner, as director-general of police.

 The statement also said: ?The chief minister or his office has never asked Sreekumar, either directly or indirectly, orally or in writing, to tap phone calls of any political leader or collect intelligence inputs regarding minorities.?

 Aiyar fights cooking gas fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said there is no shortage of cooking gas.

 Oil companies are importing LPG on a war footing. This, together with inventory management, would ensure that the entire demand from households is met, he said.

 There is absolutely no need for consumers to panic as there is no shortage of cooking gas, Aiyar added.

 Indian Oil Corporation is importing an extra 27 cargoes in October and November, of which 14 have already been contracted. Bharat Petroleum expects its additional imports to land by the month-end.

 Aiyar said the oil companies have the storage capacity to hold 12-day stocks. At present, they hold inventories that can last the country seven days even if no LPG is produced.

 Supplies were hit after the Reliance refinery at Jamnagar ? the countrys biggest ? closed for maintenance.

 But the current stocks are only 0.5 million tonnes less than the ideal level and this could be met through imports, Aiyar said. Increased imports by the US had caused some shortage in the international market, but the situation was not alarming. The petroleum companies, backed by oil diplomacy, would be able to arrange for the required imports.

 An emergency task force of the oil industry, headed by the Indian Oil chairman, had been set up. The minister said he would assist it by talking to the oil ministers of exporting countries.

 The government had received information about the Reliance shutdown in September and the oil companies had already gone in for additional imports.

 However, because of the damage to the US refineries in the hurricanes, the prices of LPG had shot up and the availability had declined.

 The Reliance refinery is expected to start production in six weeks, he said. 

 The minister said the situation in Delhi and its surrounding region was bad because of a workers strike at Indian Oils LPG bottling plant. This would have been made up by an extra working day but last Sunday was Gandhi Jayanti. The shortfall will now be covered next Sunday.

 Oil companies would also monitor distributors through a computer alert system to check illegal diversion of cooking gas. A redress mechanism would be put in place to allow consumers to contact oil officials if they did not get their supplies.

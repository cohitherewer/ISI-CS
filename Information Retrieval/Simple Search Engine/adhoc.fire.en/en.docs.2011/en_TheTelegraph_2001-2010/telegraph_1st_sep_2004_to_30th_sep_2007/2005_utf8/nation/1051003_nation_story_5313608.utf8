 Sarabjit sister optimistic of release

 Sarabjit: Mercy hope?

 New Delhi, Oct. 2 (PTI): The chances of Sarabjit Singh, on death row in Pakistan for alleged involvement in bomb blasts, escaping the gallows have become more stronger with one of the blast victims son advocating mercy to him, his sister said today.

 Dalbir Kaur, who is in Delhi to apply for a visa to visit Pakistan to intensify efforts for Sarabjits release, said she expected a favourable verdict after his lawyer filed a review petition against the death sentence. 

 The petition stated that Sarabjit had already spent about 15 years in prison and pleaded that he be given the benefit of doubt.

 I am hopeful of a favourable verdict after Rana Abdul Hamid (the lawyer) assured me that the review petition, along with Salim Shaukats (son of a blast victim) view that Sarabjit should be granted mercy, will ensure his speedy release, Kaur said.

 I think the case has become more stronger towards our side with this (support of Shaukat) and I hope to reunite with my brother soon.

 Kaur also hoped that foreign minister K. Natwar Singh would negotiate with Pakistan for Sarabjits release during his visit to the country beginning today.

 I will meet the authorities here tomorrow and request them to grant me a visa to visit Pakistan. I hope to meet President Pervez Musharraf and also the relatives of the blast victims so that the release of my brother is speeded up, she said.

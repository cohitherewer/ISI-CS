 NDA claims twin wins

New Delhi, March 9: It was a double whammy for the UPA and twin victories for the NDA on Jharkhand today. 

 Apart from a ?favourable? order on Jharkhand from the Supreme Court, the National Democratic Alliance claimed it had scored a bonus point with its second ?positive? meeting with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in a week.

 NDA convener George Fernandes, who led the delegation to Rashtrapati Bhavan, said: ?The Supreme Court has given us justice.? 

 BJP general secretary Rajnath Singh, who is in charge of Jharkhand, said the ?judgment has been exactly according to our wishes?. 

 The BJP?s parliamentary party spokesperson, V.K. Malhotra, used the apex court?s ruling to slam Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 

 ?It is a slap on the face of the Congress, the UPA government and Sonia?s failed strategy. What we asked for, the Supreme Court has given (us). Somehow by hook or by crook, the UPA wanted to come to power because the Congress cannot live without it. But now (Shibu) Soren must resign,? he said.

 Malhotra criticised the chief minister for appointing a ?relatively junior? member, Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu, as the acting Speaker. ?He has broken a 50-year precedent where the seniormost member is elected to the post.? 

 The nit-picking apart, the BJP claimed it had a ?psychological? edge over the UPA, thanks to three developments: the ?wholesale condemnation? by the media of governor Syed Sibtey Razi?s action of swearing in Soren, the ?positive? response from Rashtrapati Bhavan and finally, the court?s ruling today.

 In its 15-minute meeting with Kalam, the NDA urged him to appoint an observer to monitor the proceedings in the Jharkhand Assembly on the day of confidence vote and ensure that police protection is provided to all the MLAs. 

 Fernandes also requested the President to ensure that ?no coercive or punitive action? is taken by Jharkhand police against any legislator till the vote of confidence is completed. 

 The NDA convener alleged that a ?sinister attempt was made to pressure Independent MLAs through the rampant misuse of state power?.

 A memorandum submitted to the President said: ?Even though all the five Independent MLAs have affirmed before your good self and also the media that they are willingly and voluntarily supporting the NDA, yet false cases of kidnapping and harassment of their family members are continuing unabated.? 

 Fernandes even sought Kalam?s intervention in the recall of the governor, but this was not mentioned in the memorandum.

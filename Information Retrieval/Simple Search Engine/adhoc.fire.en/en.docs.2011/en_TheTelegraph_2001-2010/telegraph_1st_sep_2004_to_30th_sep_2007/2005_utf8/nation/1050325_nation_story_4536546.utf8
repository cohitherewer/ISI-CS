 Tsunami holds up Cong polls

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, March 24: Sonia Gandhi?s re-election as Congress president has been delayed by last year?s tsunami disaster.

 The re-election exercise was scheduled for completion by April 30 but may now conclude only by end-May.

 ?We are having to reschedule the organisational election exercise in Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Kerala and Andaman and Nicobar Islands because of the tsunami. So the concluding part ? the Congress president?s election ? is also being rescheduled,? Oscar Fernandes said.

 The party chief cannot be elected without first electing PCC and AICC members, who form the electoral college for the purpose.

 The delay can also be attributed to party units? preoccupation with Assembly polls in Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana, said Fernandes, chairman of the Congress?s central election authority.

 So the earliest the party president?s election can be held is by end-May, he added.

 The organisational poll delay may compel Sonia to undertake a minor reshuffle of the AICC set-up in view of next year?s Assembly polls in Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry.

 After the poor poll experience in Bihar and Jharkhand, Sonia is understood to be serious about assigning proper electoral responsibility to senior colleagues in these five states where the party is not in a comfortable position.

 Sonia, a senior party general secretary said, is thinking of handing charge of each poll-bound state to a senior general secretary.

 Ambika Soni holds ad hoc charge of Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry after predecessor Salman Khursheed was made Uttar Pradesh party chief. She might be relieved of these responsibilities as she was put in charge of the AICC media department earlier this month.

 Ahmed Patel, Sonia?s political secretary, may be relieved of the charge of the trouble-prone Kerala unit. Digvijay Singh, however, is likely to continue with Assam.

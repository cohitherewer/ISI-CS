 Damper on Hurriyat

 Islamabad, June 7 (PTI): Pakistan today made it clear to visiting separatist Kashmiri leaders that it cannot force India to include them in the dialogue process to resolve the Kashmir dispute.

 Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, who held a two-hour dinner meeting with the team headed by Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, however, said a solution to the dispute has to be acceptable to India, Pakistan and Kashmiris. He assured the separatist leaders that Pakistan would continue to consult the true representatives of Kashmiri people before taking any major step, the state-run APP news agency said. 

 Earlier, foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri told them during a two-hour luncheon meeting that Pakistan cannot force India to include the Kashmiri representatives in the dialogue.

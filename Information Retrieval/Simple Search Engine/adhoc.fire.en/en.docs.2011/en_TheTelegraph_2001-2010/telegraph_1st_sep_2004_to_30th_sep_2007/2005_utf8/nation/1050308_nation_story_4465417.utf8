 One dies, 3 escape with money

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, March 7: Patna police today had their hands full after a ?poll-induced? lull, during which the crime graph dipped across the state.

 A police team killed a criminal while chasing a group of four robbers, which was trying to flee after snatching money from a couple of women. A hunt is on for the three criminals who managed to escape. 

 The police also recovered five bombs, a pistol and a live cartridge from the spot.

 Sources said Ranju Devi of Punaichak and another woman were travelling in a cycle-rickshaw around 3 pm when the four criminals intercepted them near Kargil Chowk at Gandhi Maidan. 

 The men snatched the moneybag after exploding a crude bomb and tried to escape. Hearing the cries of the women, policemen posted near the chowk gave chase and opened fire after the criminals hurled bombs at them.

 ?One of the criminals was killed while none of the policemen sustained injuries,? Town deputy superintendent of police Rakesh Dubey said.

 STAR names its soap price 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 5: Its official. STAR Network today disclosed exactly how many lakhs of rupees it costs advertisers to buy a few seconds on it when the queen of soaps, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, is on air.

 The network released its official rate card for advertisers today, giving the figures for some of its programmes for which the rates have been fixed. It is the first television channel in India to do so.

 Announcing a new package, STAR said the leading serial, Kyunki, costs Rs 8,16,000 for a 30-second spot. Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki, the second leading TVR-earner, costs Rs 7,14,000 for a spot of the same duration. Kasautii Zindagii Kay and Kahiin to Hoga cost Rs 6,63,000 and Rs 4,95,000 for the same time. And so it goes on in diminishing order.

 But STAR has not called it the new rate card, preferring to call it a package and says the rates now will be rationalised and non-negotiable.

 Answering the charge that the print media also has printed ad rates, but the prices are always negotiable, STAR India COO Sameer Nair said advertisers can try.

 The network did not divulge the rates for the second part of Kaun Banega Crorepati that will start on August 5, but said its sponsorships were finalised, though ad spots were yet to be sold. The rates will be on our website soon, said Kevin Vaz, executive vice president, ad sales.

 The network also did not disclose its revenue figures. It has more than 400 advertisers across the channels.

 Nair said the new package would suit advertisers better because advertising across the channels of the network will now be more cost-effective.

 This is STARs bid to build up a new weekend strategy in the countdown to KBC 2. The quiz programme hosted by Amitabh Bachchan will be aired from Friday to Sunday. But on Fridays, along with KBC, it will be extended serial time on STAR Plus. The serials Kyunki, Kasautii Zindagii Kay and Kahiin to Hoga, which are aired from Monday to Thursday, will also be aired on Friday evening, on either side of KBC.

 The network said it was encouraging advertisers to come across on all its Hindi entertainment channels as it was leading by a huge margin in the Hindi market. It said STAR Utsav that airs old STAR Plus programmes has made a huge dent in north Indian, especially in non-metros and rural markets. 

 STAR said the restructuring was also prompted by the latest National Readership Survey, which said cable and satellite homes number 61 million in India, up by 43 per cent compared to 2003.

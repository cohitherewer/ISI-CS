 Not all can be Indian 

 - Govt move to stop misuse of tag by private colleges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: Private educational institutions with Indian in their names will have to watch out, with the Centre frowning on misuse of the word.

 It has come to notice that several institutions are using the word Indian prefixed to the name, which is not permitted in terms of Section 3 of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1950, a government communication said.

 It was sent by the human resource development ministry, which has launched a campaign to weed out substandard institutes of higher education. Yesterday, the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) ? the apex body governing technical institutions ? laid down a code of conduct for private colleges.

 The AICTE and the University Grants Commission received the human resource development ministry communication asking for misuse of the word Indian to be stopped forthwith.

 What is happening is that many of the institutes are attaching the Indian prefix to their names to market themselves better, an HRD official said. The prefix is used because the Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Management are the best-known brands, he added.

 The use of the word Indian confers on an institution a national character, often far from true, officials said.

 While the Centre does not spell out what action it plans to take against institutions using the prefix Indian, it is possible to file a case against such institutions under the emblems act.

 No person shall use or continue to use any name which may suggest or be calculated to suggest the patronage of the Government of India or the state governments for trade or profession without the permission of the Centre, the act says.

 Management guru Arindam Chaudhurys Indian Institute of Planning and Management was recently in the eye of a storm after a magazine busted its tall claims. 

 The institute, which markets itself as a premier business school, claims to have faculty members from Harvard, Columbia and Yale and offer placement to all students besides extra facilities like a swimming pool and a golf course.

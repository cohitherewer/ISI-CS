 Bofors notice

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Hinduja brothers in the Bofors case after admitting a public interest litigation by advocate Ajay Agarwal that challenges their acquittal by Delhi High Court, reports our legal correspondent.

 The petitioner contended that the high court had erred in acquitting the UK-based brothers. Agarwal claimed that he was compelled to file the PIL as the matter involved public money and the CBI had failed to move the apex court against the high court order. 

 In May, the high court had quashed the charges against the Hindujas but criticised the CBI for spending crores in the probe to come out with nothing.

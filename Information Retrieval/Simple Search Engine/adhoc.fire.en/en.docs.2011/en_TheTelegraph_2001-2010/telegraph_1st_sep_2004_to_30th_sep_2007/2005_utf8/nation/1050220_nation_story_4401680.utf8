 Pilot averts airport tragedy

Jammu (PTI): An Alliance Air pilot aborted a Jammu-Leh flight, 

saving the lives of 115 passengers, when he grounded the plane after it developed 

a technical snag before take-off from Jammu airport, a senior Indian Airlines 

official said.

 As the CD-7425 was about to take off around 11.15 am, Captain P. Mishra heard a noise and felt the Boeing 737?s engine number two on the right vibrate, the official said.

 Mishra taxied the plane back to halt point where technical staff looked into the snag.

 An airport police officer said smoke was seen coming out of the engine but added that there was no fire and extinguishers were used as a precautionary measure.

 The flight had come from Leh at 10.45 am and was scheduled to make the return trip.

 An additional flight is being pressed into service to carry the passengers to Leh, airport sources said.

 Polio alert after vaccine fails

Aligarh (PTI): The World Health Organisation has been alerted 

following confirmation of polio in a one-year-old child, who had been administered 

pulse polio vaccine seven times, in Uttar Pradesh.

 Laboratory reports from New Delhi received on Friday confirmed the polio virus in the child from Udlallyaspur village, medical department sources said.

 The child had been detected with polio-like symptoms about a month back, they said.

 Health officials are, however, concerned over the fact that the child contracted the disease despite having been administered the vaccine seven times, the sources added.

 A team of health officials were investigating reports that the virus may have emanated from neighbouring Mathura and Bulandshahr districts.

 Aligarh district, which reported 17 cases of polio in 2003 ? the highest in the country that year ? had been polio free for over a year.

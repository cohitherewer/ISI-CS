 Dubai maid in raffle ripoff cry

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 15: A housemaid is planning to sue her former employer in Dubai, alleging that he robbed her of the Rs 5 million raffle she won at the Dubai Shopping Festival.

 Sobhana Ammukkutty, from Chirayinkeezhu near here, had won two Lexus cars and 150,000 UAE dirhams for a ticket worth Rs 1,000. The festival website, www.mydsf.com, still carries details of the prize and the recipient.

 But her employer Jaisingh Narayanan, who posed as her brother, claimed that he had paid for the ticket ? No. 0666 ? at the Global Village stall in Sobhanas name.

 Narayanan had bought other tickets for himself, his two daughters and his wife Valsala, a doctor who runs a clinic in Umm Al-Quwain. But none of them won.

 According to Sobhana, a day after she bagged the raffle, Narayanan gave her a cheque for Rs 500,000 and packed her off to India.

 Sobhana realised the folly only after reaching home. She sent petitions to Kerala chief minister Oomen Chandy and Union home minister Shivraj Patil, but to no avail.

 She then decided to take legal recourse, and A.K. Shamsudheen, a Dubai-based lawyer, accepted her brief.

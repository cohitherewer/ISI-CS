 School squad in frisk fire

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Shimla, March 17: The alleged obscene frisking of 171 schoolgirls by an education board flying squad rocked the Himachal Pradesh Assembly today.

 ?In a shameful act, three male members of a flying squad put their hands inside the undergarments of 171 plus-two girl students to search for copying material,? Major (retd) Vijay Singh Mankotia said in the Assembly today on a call-attention notice.

 Mankotia is the MLA from Shahpur, within which falls the Government Senior Secondary School, in Kangra district, 250 km from here.

 ?This incident has not only shocked the innocent girl students but also everyone who has heard about it,? Mankotia said.

 ?What is more shocking,? he added, ?is that the third male member involved in the obscene frisking is not (really) a member of the flying squad. He was a driver of the state education board and was not authorised to conduct the search.?

 State education board chairman B.R. Rahi had denied the charges at a news conference on March 11, the day the alleged frisking happened, and suspected an attempt to blackmail him.

 According to chief minister Virbhadra Singh, who made a statement, ?on March 11, 2005, around 11 am, one secretary and one additional secretary of the education board, Dharamsala, besides a female flying squad member entered the examination hall of Government Senior Secondary School, Shahpur, to check unfair means?.

 ?A total of 334 candidates ? 163 boys and 171 girls ? were appearing in the plus-two (English paper) examination? and as many as ?144 cases of unfair means were reported by the squad?.

 ?An inquiry was conducted (by the board) on March 15, 2005, to get the real picture,? Singh said. ?According to the probe report, members of the flying squad denied any involvement in the alleged frisking.?

 Mankotia, a former tourism minister, was unconvinced. ?How can a lone female member check 171 girl students, and what about the driver who is also involved in the obscene frisking?? he demanded to know.

 The MLA went on to attack Rahi. ?The antecedents of the chairman are doubtful. He is trying to hush up the matter. The examination superintendent was forced to sign a false report on March 15 that no such incident occurred,? he alleged.

 ?B.R. Rahi,? Mankotia added, ?even advised MLAs (some among the eight in Kangra who approached the chairman) to check the facts. When the girls? parents approached me, I decided to raise the matter in the (House) session?.

 The chief minister said the MLA was using harsh words against the chairman. Later, he ordered a fresh probe.

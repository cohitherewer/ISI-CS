 Water crisis hits wild animals

 New Delhi (PTI): A petition filed in 

 the Supreme Court has alleged that lack of water in national 

 parks has been causing the death of wild animals. 

 The petition also said 192 lions, 49 tigers, nine leopards and 16 bears, which were used in circuses, have not been rehabilitated and have been confined to dungeon-like cages. 

 Petitioner Vikas Jains advocate Sugreev Dubey alleged that people trading in the skin of wild animals had been camping in forest rest houses at the Indira Gandhi National Park in Jharkhand and several other reserve forests during summer. As soon as animals die due to lack of water, they take the skin, he said.

 A tigress in the Indira Gandhi National Park came out of the forest in search of water and was killed by villagers, who handed over the body to the forest officials. They, in turn, handed over the body to traders camping at the guest house of the national park at Betla in Palamau district, the petition alleged.

 However, the court said the water situation in the national parks was bound to improve with the monsoon setting over most of the country and posted the matter for further hearing on the reopening of the court after the summer vacation. 

 Sikh group stalls marriage

 London (PTI): A Sikh couple had to abandon 

 their wedding after a group of people of that community 

 stormed the hotel where the ceremony was being held alleging 

 that they had shown disrespect to the Guru Granth Sahib.

 The couple, who did not want to be named, watched helplessly as about 40 members of the Respect to Guru Granth Sahib Ji Campaign group violently interrupted the wedding at Slough, Berkshire, on Saturday. 

 The group claimed that the Sikh holy book should not have been brought to a place where alcohol, meat and cigarettes were available. The gang took the Guru Granth Sahib, which was to be used in the service, to a Gurdwara in Slough.

 Apparently, a compromise has been reached by both sides over the holy book used for the service. No one was injured in the incident and there have been no arrests, said a spokesman for Thames Valley police.

 This is the second time that the group has disrupted a wedding for religious reasons. Two weeks ago, it staged a confiscation raid on a wedding in East London. 

 Riot charges after 21 years

 New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi court has 

 framed charges against five persons who had allegedly killed 

 three members of a family and burnt their bodies during 

 the riots that followed the assassination of Prime Minister 

 Indira Gandhi in 1984.

 Niranjan Singh, a head constable, his 17-year-old son Gurpal Singh and son-in-law Mahender Singh were stabbed to death and later burnt near the Shahdara railway station. 

 An FIR was lodged after NIranjans wife, Harvinder Kaur, who was rescued by the army, returned to Delhi from Punjab in 1996.

 Former Union minister and Congress leader H.K.L. Bhagat, who was also named as an accused in the case filed by the CBI, has already been discharged because of lack of evidence.

 Gujarat curfew

 Ahmedabad (PTI): Curfew has been 

 imposed in Jaffrabad town of Amreli district in Gujarat

 communities, police said. The curfew was clamped from 2.15 

 pm on Monday.

 Ill driver kills two

 run over by a lorry, driven by a mentally ill 

 man. The man, who was once a lorry driver, began driving 

 the lorry parked at Kangeyapalayam . Six persons were also 

 injured before the lorry stopped after travelling 3 km at 

 Sulur, near here.

 14 pilgrims dead

 Sangareddy (PTI): Fourteen people, 

 including three children and four women, were killed when 

 the jeep in which they were travelling collided with a lorry 

 at Rampur in Andhra Pradesh on Sunday night. The victims 

 were on a pilgrimage to Badi Pahadi Darga in Nizamabad. 

 Three were injured.

 Spurious wine

 Hisar (PTI): Haryana police on Monday 

 claimed to have unearthed a factory allegedly making spurious 

 wines of popular brands. The police have arrested one Rajinder, 

 a resident of Kharia village and have seized a dozen wine 

 bottles.

 About two lakh devotees took part in special pujas at Sri Saneeswarar temple at Kuchanoor in Kerala to mark the transit of Saturn from Gemini to Cancer at 1.24 am on Monday.

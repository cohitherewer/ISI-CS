 Quiet Holi for Laloo 

 Patna/Jamshedpur, March 26 (PTI): The boisterous revelry was missing at 1, Anne Marg today as RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi celebrated their first Holi out of power. 

 A large number of visitors assembled at the main gate of the duo?s residence to play Holi were not allowed in by securitymen because ?saheb (Laloo) was not in a mood to celebrate due to the tsunami disaster.?

 The gate, however, opened around 4 pm as Laloo Prasad surfaced on the lawn in a spotless kurta and pyjama. When approached by mediapersons, the RJD president said he was not celebrating Holi this time as a mark of respect to the deaths and devastation caused by the tsunami.

 Asked whether the celebrations were subdued because of his party?s defeat in the Assembly poll, he shot back, ?Who says we are not in power? If you think that the RJD has been ousted, where is a government and whose government is this at present? Our rivals have failed to cobble together a majority to form a government,? he said while referring to President?s rule. 

 Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda also stayed away from Holi celebrations this year in view of the death of former Jharkhand Speaker Mrigendra Pratap Singh. Singh was the finance minister in the Munda-led cabinet before he was elected to the post of Speaker. 

 Singh, however, contested as an Independent after he was refused a BJP ticket in the recently concluded Assembly election. He was admitted to the critical care unit of Tata Main Hospital here on February 18 and breathed his last on Thursday night.

 Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, Munda and other leaders took part in the funeral procession of Singh, who was cremated with state honours at the Swarnarekhar burning ghat yesterday.

 Munda preferred to visit his constituency at Kharsawan in Seraikela-Kharswan district, sources in the chief ministers office said.

 Lock on Coke plant to open

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 1: Kerala High Court today directed the Perumatty panchayat committee to renew the licence to the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Palakkad within a week for it to resume production.

 A division bench of Justices M. Ramachandran and K.P. Balachandran said Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt Ltd could open the plant even if the panchayat failed to renew its licence.

 The judges said the panchayat had to comply with the high courts directive even while carrying out its responsibilities as a local council.

 Coke had filed an appeal in the high court, alleging that the panchayat was declining to renew its licence even after it had produced the relevant papers. 

 The company submitted that this was in defiance of the courts directive in April this year which said the plant was eligible to draw 500,000 litres of groundwater for daily use on the condition that it met the water needs of the local population. 

 The courts nod came after a report submitted by the Centre for Water Research Development and Management said that 500,000 litres of water could be used by the plant.

 Today, the high court also refused to stay its order for 10 days to give time to the panchayat to approach the Supreme Court. The rural bodys special leave petition is already before the apex court, but while sending notices to the respondents the Supreme Court had refused to interfere with the high courts proceedings.

 The Rs 50-crore Kerala bottling plant of the soft drink giant has remained closed for more than two years amid complaints of groundwater exploitation. The earlier A.K. Antony-led state government had shut down the plant in the wake of a BBC expose on the toxic nature of the plants effluent sludge.

 Tribal leader C.K. Janu started the anti-Coke agitation on April 22, 2002. The agitators have of late been demanding compensation for the workers and the people of the area, who they say are affected by the plants functioning since March 2000.

 A joint parliamentary committee report had also said that the commercial use of groundwater in the Coke plant must be adequately restricted.

 According to sources, the Coke authorities had at one time planned to shift the unit either to Tamil Nadu or a north Indian state.

 In the absence of any local production, Coke has been catering to its Kerala market with supplies from Bangalore.

 However, the reopening of the plant was expected with the high court ruling in April.

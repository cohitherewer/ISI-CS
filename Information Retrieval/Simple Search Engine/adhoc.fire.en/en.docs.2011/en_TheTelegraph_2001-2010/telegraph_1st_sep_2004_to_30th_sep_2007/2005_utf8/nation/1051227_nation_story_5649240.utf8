 Shield for BPO women

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: The rape and murder of a call centre employee in Bangalore this month because of bad fleet management can be averted in future. Technology shows us how.

 A vehicle route optimisation software connected with global positioning system (GPS) can not only help BPO companies manage vehicles better but also create a transparent, streamlined pick-up and drop-off system. All it needs is an initial investment of Rs 70 lakh-1 crore.

 Enterprise resource planning solution major SSA Global Technologies (India) Pvt Ltd has a product called RoutePro, a software that ensures a male employee gets picked up first and dropped last. In case one or both of them drop out on a particular day, the system will work out an alternative route with the same pattern. For instance, security guards may be asked to escort women.

 The system of altering a vehicles roster may not be done manually. A phone call or an e-mail to the fleet management system will activate the software that will automatically make the necessary changes and let the fleet manager and security heads know.

 Employees of the BPO company concerned can then be informed either manually or through an e-mail or SMS.

 According to a senior industry expert, there are more than 600 BPO firms in India, but only 50-75 of them have such a system in place.

 Today, boys and girls are picked-up by the vehicles hired by BPO companies. Without an effective optimised planning, they would have to haphazardly send the vehicles, said Alok Tandon, country manager, SSA Global Technologies (India) Pvt Ltd.

 BPO majors like Convergys, Hughes and American Express and Wipro use SSAs RoutePro. 

 Industry observers pointed out that a manual system invariably results in situations like wrong pick-ups and longer travel time. A vehicle route optimisation software not only automates the roster, it also maps the shortest route for vehicles and provides a safe tracking system by linking it to GPS. This makes the entire operation more efficient and safer.

 Fleet management is an elaborate effort, with factors like number of shifts, the number of employees needed on a particular shift and the need to fill gaps if someone is absent. With the Bangalore incident sending ripples across the country, more and more BPO firms are looking at the vehicle route optimisation software.

 Sunil Mehta, vice-president of Nasscom, said: We have collected the best practices and are circulating them among our members. The use of route mapping and optimisation software in addition to other physical measures are part of them.

 Along with SSA Global, Microwave and MobiApps are the other current players in the Indian vehicle route optimisation market.

 We have implemented a route mapping and fleet management software and we use a combination of manual (effort) and technology to offer maximum security to our staff, said a senior executive in IBM Daksh, a BPO company.

 Efunds International, another BPO firm, uses its own software. Till date, it has functioned effectively, its chief Atul Kunwar said.

 The $800-million SSA Global has more than 200 customers in India and a 15 per cent market share. It has employed more than 600 people at its research and development and global support centres in Hyderabad. The company also has a marketing and sales team in Delhi and Mumbai.

 Our thrust has been to provide lifelong support to the products sold by us. We have solutions and are focusing on building a team that has expertise in sales, pre-sales and consultancy for a BPO industry or any other sector, said Rajiv Kumar, the country marketing manager of SSA Global.

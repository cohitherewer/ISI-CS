 Sonia steers property bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: Nudged by Sonia Gandhi, the Union cabinet tonight cleared a womens inheritance bill for introduction in the monsoon session.

 The bill proposes major amendments to the Hindu Succession Act to ensure equality for women in all matters, including inheritance of agricultural land and property. It bears the imprint of the National Advisory Council, headed by Sonia.

 The council had proposed to the Centre that, in keeping with the common minimum programme, the Hindu succession law be given a provision granting women equal rights of ownership of assets like land and houses.

 Government sources said the amendments also aim to iron out the differences among the laws relating to womens empowerment enacted by individual states.

 For instance, in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, the laws of inheritance show a strong preference for agnatic (descending from the same male ancestor) succession, with preference for agnatic males.

 A woman can hold only a limited interest in the land: after her death the holding goes not to her descendants but to the heirs of its last male owner.

 The cabinet cleared seven other bills for introduction during the current session of Parliament, including the Protection of Women against Domestic Violence Bill, the Prevention and Control of Contagious Diseases Bill, and Adoption of National Plan of Action for Children 2005 Bill.

 The government will also table in this session of Parliament the report of the Nanavati Commission, which probed the 1984 Sikh killings in Delhi, after the Union cabinet clears it in a day or two, home minister Shivraj Patil told Rajya Sabha.

 Banking bill

 The cabinet approved a bill aimed at ensuring the government has a majority of the directors on the boards of public sector banks. It also decided to set up a financial restructuring authority for potentially weak banks.

 The bill will bring in amendments to the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking) Acts 1970 and 1980, raising the number of whole-time directors from two to four and limiting that of shareholder directors to three.

 Officials said there is no proposal to reduce the governments stake below 51 per cent in these banks. 

 The amendment will allow other changes to enhance flexibility of the banks boards and improve corporate governance, information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy said. The bill will be introduced in the current session.

 The cabinet also cleared the Food and Safety Standards Bill 2005, ending the multiplicity of food laws and regulators.

 Delhi mum on arms dilemma

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: Delhi has made it clear that no arms have been sent to Kathmandu since February 1 ? the day King Gyanendra imposed emergency ? but will not say if supplies will remain suspended till democracy is restored.

 No indications were given whether Delhi had turned down any request by the Royal Nepal Army for specific military hardware. India is Nepal?s biggest arms supplier.

 Foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said: ?The issue of arms supply to Nepal has been under continuous review in view of the disturbed situation in the country.? But he went a step further to add that India has made no military supplies to Nepal since February 1.

 This is the first time South Block has decided to come out in public about the suspension of arms supply to Nepal.

 Sarna?s assertion comes a day after Sanjay Varma, first secretary in charge of press and information in the Indian embassy in Kathmandu, made a similar announcement to the local media. The statement indicates that India is trying to reassure democratic forces in both countries that it is using its leverage to put pressure on the king.

 That South Block was clarifying the stand after Indian ambassador Shiv Shankar Mukherjee returned to Kathmandu on Sunday, is seen as an attempt by Delhi to convince its constituencies that he was sent back with a ?serious message?. Mukherjee had been summoned to Delhi for consultations after the royal coup.

 Although no meeting between the Indian ambassador and the king has taken place since Mukherjee returned to Kathmandu, the two had met earlier and Gyanendra had tried to explain what led him to dismiss the Sher Bahadur Deuba government and seize power. 

 Sources said that in the meetings, the stress from Nepal has been to maintain the strong military cooperation between the countries. But there was no demand for specific military hardware from either the army or the king. The seriousness with which India is trying to pressure the king will only become clear once such a request is received from Nepal.

 Delhi is in no mood to cut off the arms supply and snap all links with the palace as the king may then be forced to turn to China or some other country for help.

 Britain rollback

 Britain today suspended a planned package of military assistance worth ?1.34 million to Nepal. Foreign secretary Jack Straw said the UK would review the impact of the king?s action on the security assistance ?we provide to Nepal?.

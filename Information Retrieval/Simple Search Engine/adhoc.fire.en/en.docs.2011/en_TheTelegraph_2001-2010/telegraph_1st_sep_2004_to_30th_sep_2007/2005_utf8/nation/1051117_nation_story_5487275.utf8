Moscow, Nov. 16: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjees visit to Russia has been one massive effort from New Delhi to tell Moscow that it is not undoing the Bear Hug. Mukherjee took flak from the Left in June after signing the India-US defence framework agreement in Washington. The Left has alleged that he was bartering away Indian security interests to America.

 Mukherjees sojourn in Moscow this time not only restores the balance somewhat but also brings into sharp focus the deep and wide military ties that India and Russia share. Agreements that have a bearing on the military-technical relationship could well underpin the Prime Ministers visit.

 A look at what Mukherjees Moscow kitty looks like after the conclusion of the military-technical talks this afternoon:

 The Intellectual Property Rights Agreement: Mukherjee and Ivanov have announced that the two sides have agreed to its text. The Russians have been insistent on the agreement to cover all future defence deals. The agreement will be signed during Manmohan Singhs visit

 Advanced Technical Vessel (ATV) and naval acquisitions: Mukherjee said the two sides have identified areas for production of certain equipment for the ATV, a euphemism for Indias submarine programme, and the air defence ship. This is probably the first time that collaboration on the ATV has been acknowledged at this level

 Fifth generation fighter aircraft: Mukherjee said the IAF has committed to actively engage itself with concrete offers from Sukhoi and RAC MiG Corporation. He said the Indian government has made it clear that it will participate in the programme and has conveyed its interest in taking a financial stake in it

 Medium lift transport aircraft: The project is being taken up for the IAF to acquire aircraft capable of lifting payloads between its AN 32s and IL 76s in the sub-20-tonne category. India has given a draft proposal for a joint venture company. The project is estimated around Rs 7,000 crore

 Brahmos Supersonic Cruise Missile: Ivanov announced during the meeting of the IGC on MTC (inter governmental commission on military technical cooperation) that Russia and India will jointly make an effort to market the missile to friendly third countries. The first country identified for such an export project is Chile which Mukherjee visited last month and which this month sent its army and naval chiefs to New Delhi.

 The missile is touted to be more effective than the subsonic Tomahawk used by the US forces. The Russian side also announced that it was preparing to induct the Brahmos into its navy. Moscow also committed a fresh infusion of $ 25.2 million for the enhanced authorised capital of the joint venture project that draws its name from the Brahmaputra and Moskva rivers

 GLONASS: Mukherjee announced that Russia has agreed to India using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) on a request from the Indian department of space. The two countries are to launch 16 more satellites in three years, an agreement that was touched upon during Putins visit to New Delhi in 2004

 Further joint research and development efforts: Involving the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and several Russian science institutes. Some progress has been recorded in the efforts for the Kaveri engine. The engine is to be used in Indias Light Combat Aircraft project. It is being tried in Russia and is now to enter into a flight bed test. In flight bed tests, the engine will be fired from another aircraft that already runs on at least two other engines.

 Women?s turn to float board

 OUR BUREAU

 Feb. 2: Muslim law boards continued to mushroom with the formation of a women?s counterpart in Lucknow today that was not acknowledged by the community?s apex decision-making body in the country.

 A group of Muslim women, including social workers and members of political families, has floated the All India Muslim Women?s Personal Law Board with 35 members drawn from across the country. The move was formally announced today.

 ?The AIMPLB (All India Muslim Personal Law Board) failed to champion women?s issues. It is time a women?s board takes up these issues and gives them justice,? said Shaista Amber, appointed the board chairperson.

 The move comes close on the heels of the formation of two other law boards to represent Shia and Barelvi sects of Muslims.

 Law board chief Maulana Rabey Nadvi asserted that his organisation represented all Muslims in the country and said the sprouting of new boards could not be dubbed a rift or split. ?Not a single member of the AIMPLB executive or general body has quit so far.?

 He denied the board was neglecting some sections of the community, including women. ?It is false propaganda that has nothing to do with reality.?

 Parveen Abdi, general secretary of the women?s board, does not agree. ?Women have gone through hell. They became victims of incest, they faced coercive marriages, whimsical divorces and capricious judgments of qazis. There seemed to be no one to take up the suffering woman?s cause, not the least the AIMPLB,? she said.

 ?When a few months ago the AIMPLB passed a model nikaahnama, nobody bothered to check with the average women, understand their sentiments,? said Begum Ameer Hyder, vice-president of the new board.

 Shia scholar Maulana Kalbe Jawwad, nephew of noted cleric Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, suspected an ?international conspiracy? and claimed ?the wild accusations about women not being heard by the board (AIMPLB) are baseless?.

 ?We have gone to the extent of granting sanctity to women offering namaz in mosques. Where is the question of discrimination?? he asked.

 Begum Naseem Iqtedar Ali, a woman member of the AIMPLB executive, called the new board a ?stunt?. ?There is no need for an independent women?s law board. Perhaps, a sub-committee under the AIMPLB could have sufficed for a closer focus on problems of women,? she said.

 She added that 25 of the 200 board members were women.

 A cautious Nadvi said ?there is a lot of misunderstanding over the issue (of discrimination by the board)?.

 He argued that forming separate boards in the name of resolving community issues was no solution. The reference was to the call of some for a two-child norm and a ban on triple talaq and women?s demand for sweeping social reforms.

 Nadvi said it was impossible to enforce reforms quickly given the diversity within the community in the country.

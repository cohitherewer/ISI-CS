 Potter pirates encash half-blood magic

 - Editions at one-third price

 Mumbai, July 20: This is one crime Harry Potter sets into motion himself and its capital in India seems to be Mumbai.

 Thanks to the magic sales numbers of the sixth Potter book, Mumbais streets are no longer overflowing with traffic alone, but also with pirated editions of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, at one-third the original price or less.

 Even as Penguin India, which is distributing the book in the country, claims to have sold 100,000 copies, the pirated Harry Potters are being sold in the city at less than one-third of the original price of Rs 895.

 At the traffic signal in Haji Ali, one of the busiest crossroads, they are being sold for as little as Rs 250, after a bit of bargaining. 

 Two teenagers, who otherwise sell a city tabloid and pirated copies of The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari to cars that stop at the signal, are hawking the book aggressively. They begin by asking for Rs 750, but agree to one-third of the price after a little persuasion.

 They claim to have sold about 400 copies since Monday, when the pirated copies flooded the market. They said they dont know where the copies came from, except that their seth gave it to them.

 There were many other traffic signals in Mumbai other than Haji Ali where Harry Potter has materialised in a similar way since Monday. 

 But even if Harry cannot do anything about it, except encourage it, he draws attention to a type of intellectual property theft in the country that is not discussed as much as audio or film piracy.

 Penguin India said book piracy is a crime that is steadily eating into the legitimate trade, but it erupts every time a Harry Potter is around, with Mumbai featuring prominently.

 We have received reports of piracy in Mumbai. We anticipated the problem and had spoken in advance to a firm of lawyers specialising in copyright, said P.M. Sukumar, senior vice-president, sales and marketing, Penguin India. Their operatives in Mumbai should get in touch with police and identify the source of the copying, he said.

 This time we have heard of piracy only in Mumbai. With the fifth book, it started in Bangalore and came to Mumbai, Sukumar added.

 The police said they have started to take action. We have sent teams to Haji Ali and Worli, said deputy commissioner of police Sanjay Apranti of the crime branch.

 The police action may take care of the few remaining unsold copies for the time being in Haji Ali. But the menace remains, for it is widespread and easy, as Sukumar pointed out.

 I cant specify a number, but for a book as big as Harry Potter, there will be a pirated copy for every two original books sold, he said.

 Penguin had ordered 135,000 copies and has placed a second order of 30,000 copies.

 This time, the pirated books came into the market within three days of the originals. Better technology is also helping piracy, he added.

 A publishing industry person said piracy printing is easily done with off-set printing and no other investment. 

 Thats why they can afford to sell the books at such a low price, said Sukumar. We had to keep the price at Rs 895 after trying to fix it at as low as possible, he added.

 Piracy is always there, he said. About 15 per cent to 20 per cent of our sales is affected by piracy, said Sukumar. The authors who are pirated most are Khushwant Singh and Shobhaa De. 

 But rather than fiction, it is the education (computer, management) books market that suffers most from piracy, he added.

 According to an estimate by the Federation of Publishers and Booksellers Associations in India, New Delhi, the industry loses from Rs 350 crore to Rs 450 crore to piracy.

 There are police raids on warehouses where the books are being printed and arrests made, but there are hardly any convictions, rues the association. On the other hand, the copiers make their fortunes selling thousands of pirated versions of Chicken Soup for the Soul, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, Fish and Who Moved My Cheese.

 The good news is that if Who Moved My Cheese can be picked up for Rs 75 from the street corner, so can its hard-hitting parody, I Moved Your Cheese, for the same amount.

 Sonia rap on MPs

 New Delhi, May 2: Like a headmistress taking naughty pupils to task, Sonia Gandhi today gave Congress Rajya Sabha members a piece of her mind for their rampant absenteeism, reports our special correspondent.

 ?You have been handpicked (to sit in the Upper House) for a purpose. But we have found that not even a dozen of you are present in the House at any point of time,? the Congress president told the MPs. ?This cannot continue. You must attend House proceedings.?

 Sonia spent almost half the day in Parliament, meeting 55 MPs in nine batches in her chamber, sparing only the ministers.

 The immediate provocation for the session was the repeated adjournment of House proceedings last week while the National Democratic Alliance?s boycott of Parliament was on. ?It was most embarrassing that there weren?t enough members from our side and the proceedings had to be adjourned for lack of quorum,? Sonia fumed.

 Just over a month ago, the Congress leadership had drawn rosters for each House, requiring every party MP to attend proceedings for at least one of the two sessions ? morning or afternoon ? every day. 

 The members were told they would be considered for foreign tours on parliamentary delegations only on the basis of their attendance. Yet, Sonia noted with annoyance today, attendance continued to be dismal. For most of the time last Thursday and Friday, hardly seven or eight party MPs were present in the House, leading to the adjournments.

 ?Lok Sabha members may be pre-occupied with problems concerning their constituencies. But you don?t have that problem,? an MP quoted Sonia as telling the Rajya Sabha members.

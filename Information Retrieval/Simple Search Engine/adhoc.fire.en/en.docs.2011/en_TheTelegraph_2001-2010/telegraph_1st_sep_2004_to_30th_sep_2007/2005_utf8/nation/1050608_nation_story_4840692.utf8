 Exit Mansingh, enter Mirdha

 Mansingh

 New Delhi, June 7: Dancer Sonal Mansinghs controversial reign at the helm of Sangeet Natak Akademi ended today with the Centre replacing her with Ram Niwas Mirdha, former Union minister and Congress leader.

 Mansingh had almost sparked a revolt in the pivotal cultural organisation with leading artistes quitting their posts in protest against her alleged autocratic ways and saffron sympathies.

 Mirdha, who will be the new chairman, had handled various portfolios in the governments headed by Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi and led the joint parliamentary committee that probed the securities scam in the 1990s. He was chairman of the Congresss central election authority till a few months ago and has been associated with the field of arts for long.

 Mansingh, who had canvassed votes for Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi through signed advertisements in the NDAs India Shining campaign, has been accused of trying to politicise, personalise and trivialise the Akademi.

 Those who put in their papers in protest included three of the five government nominees ? vice-chairman Kavalam Narayana Panicker, Carnatic musician Balamuralikrishna and Savitri Heisnam.

 They and other leading music, dance and theatre personalities ? such as Raja and Radha Reddy, M.K. Raina, Nadira Babbar, G.S. Channy, Mohan Maharishi, Kamal Tiwari, N.K. Sharma and Dolly Ahluwalia ? submitted a six-page list of complaints against Mansingh to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 The resignations, however, were put on hold by Union culture minister S. Jaipal Reddy, who declined to accept them until a final decision was taken on Mansingh.

 Her critics cite how the dancer refused to call meetings of the executive boards general council and how she unilaterally ended the golden jubilee programme in January 2004, 11 months ahead of schedule.

 They accuse her of producing CD-Roms on the Akademis behalf for self-promotion, citing one on Indian dance that makes no mention of contemporary greats, such as her guru Kelucharan Mahapatra. It begins with a speech by her and ends with excerpts from her dance recitals with some remarks by Vajpayee thrown in-between.

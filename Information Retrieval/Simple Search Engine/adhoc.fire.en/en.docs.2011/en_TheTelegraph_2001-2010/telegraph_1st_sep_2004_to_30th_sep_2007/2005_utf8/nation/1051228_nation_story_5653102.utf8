 Warrant relief for Gavaskar

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 27 (PTI): The metropolitan court today cancelled the arrest warrant issued against former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar in a case of a bogus footwear company and adjourned the matter till January 21.

 The cricket icon today appeared in person before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate who had earlier issued the warrant following Gavaskars failure to appear before the court in the case. 

 Gavaskars name figured in the case filed by the Registrar of Companies, Ahmedabad, as one of the six directors of the Vadodara-based Topline Shoes Ltd, which disappeared after raising Rs 4.65 crore through a public issue. The case was filed in a local court after the company vanished in 1995.

 Gavaskar, on previous occasions, had denied being a part of the company. According to a lawyer representing Gavaskar, the cricketer had resigned from the board of the company in 1994 and was now not even a shareholder.

 On June 11, 1992, Topline Shoes had set up its registered office in Vadodara and issued equity shares to raise money for manufacturing leather and sports shoes at its factory in Padra, 40 km from Vadodara.

 The company had floated an IPO of 46.5 lakh shares at Rs 10 each in 1992 and said it had an installed capacity of manufacturing nine lakh pairs of shoes every year.

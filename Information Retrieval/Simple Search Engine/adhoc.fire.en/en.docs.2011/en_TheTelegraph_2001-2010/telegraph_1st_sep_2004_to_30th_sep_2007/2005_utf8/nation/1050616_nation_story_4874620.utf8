 UP backs film relief

 Lucknow, June 15 (PTI): Mulayam Singh Yadavs government in Uttar Pradesh has brushed aside allegations that it was favouring movies of Amitabh Bachchan and claimed decisions to allot tax-free tags were taken collectively by the state cabinet.

 It was a decision of the state cabinet, public works department minister Shivpal Singh Yadav told reporters today in reply to a question on why the Bachchan-starrer Bunty Aur Babli was accorded the tax-free status.

 The state government had on previous occasions waived taxes on two other Bachchan films, Waqt and Baghban.

 The minister also denied that the Samajwadi Party was opposed to the womens reservation bill, saying it only wanted some changes in the bill.

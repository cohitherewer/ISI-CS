 Sex education is not a right: SC

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has said sex education in schools cannot be brought under the ambit of fundamental rights by making it a part of right to education.

 The bench gave the ruling while dealing with a PIL that suggested making sex education in schools compulsory, to help check incidents of rape.

 The PIL, filed by an NGO in 2003, had expressed concern over the safety and security of women in the capital due to the increasing instances of rape. It had offered various suggestions, including making sex education compulsory in schools.

 While agreeing with its suggestions, the court said it was satisfied with the efforts and steps enumerated by the Delhi government in its affidavit.

 Inland glut tells on cards

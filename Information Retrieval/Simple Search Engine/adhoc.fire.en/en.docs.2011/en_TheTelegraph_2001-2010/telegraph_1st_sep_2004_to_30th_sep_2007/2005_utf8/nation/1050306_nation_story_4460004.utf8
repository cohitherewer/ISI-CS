 Bush-basher Chavez assures India oil

 Chavez: Reaching out

 New Delhi, March 5: If anti-Americanism is the brand name then few sell it better than Hugo Chavez. This time round, the Venezuelan President wants to market it in India in his bid to make the country?s leadership aware of the ?danger? that George W. Bush poses to the world.

 ?I have nothing against the American people or the American society. But how can one maintain any relations with the US government which lies about almost everything to its people and the world,? Chavez said.

 In India on a first-ever head of state visit from Venezuela, Chavez wants to remind everyone of its significance. Friendship is important. We want to have friends in the world,? he said. ?It is high time to do this not only with the government of India but also with the people and the institutions in the country.?

 To ensure that the friendship stabilises and deepens, Chavez has offered India assured supply of oil and gas as well as joint-ventures in Venezuelan oil reserves. He makes it a point to inform that Venezuela has the ?largest proven deposit of oil in the planet?. With the Indian economy growing at a phenomenal 6 to 7 per cent, Chavez has offered India assured supply of oil and gas from his country?s reserves at a much cheaper rate than the price at which the government is buying.

 In his discussions with the Indian leadership, the President not only expressed his country?s unambiguous support for Delhi?s entry into the UN Security Council, but also signed six agreements, including two on cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector.

 Offering ONGC (Videsh) oil exploration at a Venezuelan field, Chavez also said he wants to help India convert heavy crude in Rajathstan.

 In his two-hour long interaction with the media at the Maurya Sheraton hotel this afternoon, Chavez poked fun at George W. Bush for being the worst liar and regaled journalists by comparing the US President with a unfaithful husband who tries to convince his wife that the lipstick marks on his face are not from his lover but from a clown.

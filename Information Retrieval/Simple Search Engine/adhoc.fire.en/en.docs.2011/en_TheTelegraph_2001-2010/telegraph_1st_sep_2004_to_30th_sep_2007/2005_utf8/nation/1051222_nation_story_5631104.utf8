 Money minus accountability

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The study carried out by veteran parliamentarian Era Sezhiyan had reached a series of conclusions against the MP local area development (MPLAD) scheme.

 India has a parallel planning apparatus, one under the Centre, the states and the district planning committees and the other under the local area development schemes for MPs, MLAs and municipal councillors. The MPLAD scheme remains isolated without accounting or accountability to any other body.

 The scheme is an assault on the Constitution. The discretionary power enjoyed by the MP appears to be wholly outside the Constitution.

 Sezhiyans point was that the expenditure of Rs 800 crore a year (the total amount allotted for the scheme) as constituency development amount was beyond Parliaments scrutiny. No question could be put to a member on who authorised the spending. Nor was he required to justify the spending, unless he was a minister.

 The scheme was inconsistent with the spirit of federalism and distribution of powers between the Union and the states. It encroached on areas of local government institutions.

 Political bias was inherent in the scheme. ? He (the MP) will be inclined, more often, to give preference to the demands of those who are politically favourable to him or likely to be favourable to him and his party in the elections.

 Overt exploitation by the bureaucracy. 

 The statistics and programme implementation ministry administering the scheme did not have a proper accounting procedure.

 The ministry did not submit any action taken notes to the CAGs 1998 audit report which, as Sezhiyan noted, disclosed several irregularities.

 Lalu Prasad: Praise purge

 Patna, Dec. 4: The messiah of the poor is on his way out of the school syllabus.

 Taking the cleansing of Bihar politics a step further, the NDA government has announced the deletion of the passage on Rashtriya Janata Dal president Lalu Prasad from the Hindi textbook for Class VIII.

 Once the two-page passage is done away with, students will no longer have to read about the mitti ke gaurav (pride of the soil).

 A simple person from an ordinary village in Bihar, Laluji grew up grazing cattle and eating sattu and rose to the heights of the chief ministership ? the days are numbered for such glowing descriptions as human resource development minister Brishen Patel seems to be in a hurry to undo the historical wrong.

 Lalu Yadav is not a great historical figure. He has not done anything great and does not deserve to occupy those pages. Lalu is not a model for school students. Including his life in the curriculum with other legends cannot be justified, he said, adding that the government will review the matter shortly and make changes to the text so that the children get healthy education.

 Dalit activist Jyotiba Phule is likely to be a new inclusion. Phules life is an inspiration for children, Patel said.

 Karpoori Thakur and Bhola Paswan Shastri, who share text space with Lalu Prasad at present, have been spared the chop.

 Reacting to the governments decision, RJD leader and former minister Shyam Rajak said: It is an insult, a pure insult. Instead of focusing on crime control and development, the government is eager to give us a bad name. The manuvadis are back in action as was seen in the days of the NDA rule in Delhi.

 A more restrained Shivanand Tiwary said: It is too early to comment. But he did remind the correspondent of Murli Manohar Joshis stint as Union HRD minister and the steps that he had taken.

 Jyoti Mehra, a teacher at St Xaviers School, said her students always giggled while reading the passage on Lalu Prasad. The contradictions were clear even to the children. The text sounded artificial and out of context. The students felt demoralised to speak highly of Lalu. And for myself, my conscience did not allow me to teach the lesson, the teacher recalled.

 The RJD strongmans saga does not end with the textbook. The government has also planned to revive his pet projects, the Charwaha and Pahelwan schools.

 The Charwaha and Pahelwan schools were a good idea, but the RJD governments used them only as slogans and did nothing for their development. We want to remodel them as efficient centres of vocational training for poor and deprived children, Patel said.

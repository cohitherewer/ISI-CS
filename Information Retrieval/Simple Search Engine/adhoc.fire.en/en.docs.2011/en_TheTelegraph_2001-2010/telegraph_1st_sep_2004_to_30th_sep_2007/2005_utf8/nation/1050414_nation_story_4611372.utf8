 Jayalalithaa: Early bird

 Chennai, April 13: Jayalalithaa today made sure no other party could hijack the language plank as her ruling ADMK got the Assembly to adopt a resolution that urged the Centre to declare the Tamil classic Thirukkural as national literature.

 The resolution, moved by the chief minister and adopted unanimously by the House, said saint-poet Thiruvalluvar?s work ?stands out as a treatise of universal and national appeal as national literature?.

 Jayalalithaa?s move came a day after the Pattali Makkal Katchi, which is part of the Congress-led alliance at the Centre, tried to project itself as the champion of Tamil language and culture. PMK floor leader G.K. Mani said many students were passing the matriculation examination without ever being exposed to the Tamil language in school.

 The resolution said the 1,330 couplets that date back to the first century BC are a ?timeless treasure house of wisdom, guiding mankind in human values?. It added that after the Holy Bible, the masterpiece has the distinction of having been translated into the maximum number of languages in the world. 

 The resolution said Thirukkural was ?uniquely relevant? to the secular values of modern India and its polity and pointed out that the work not only contains the basic tenets of democracy, secularism and social justice, but also traverses the ?entire gamut of human values, both ethical and material?. 

 ?It is the fervent desire of every member of this House that the immortal treatise Thirukkural, which is incomparable in its unparalleled value, be declared as national literature of India,? the resolution added.

 The House passed the resolution after a suggestion by Opposition DMK leader K. Anbazhagan ? that this has been a ?longstanding and persistent request of Tamil scholars and Intellectuals? ? was incorporated into the resolution.

 The issue had come up in the Assembly a few days ago. But Jayalalithaa took the entire Opposition by surprise this morning when she suddenly moved the resolution, which has immense political significance as the DMK has been tom-toming its efforts to get Tamil declared a classical language after it joined the government at the Centre.

 With the Tamil new year?s day tomorrow, the resolution could also be seen as a new-year gift to the people of the state. Speaker K. Kalimuthu later congratulated Jayalalithaa for bringing in the resolution.

 As the 35-day budget session drew to a close, Jayalalithaa had one more gift ? for farmers hit hard by the drought in the last three years. The government, in a pre-election year sop, waived interest on their overdues to cooperative banks for farm and non-farm sector loans to the extent of Rs 290.20 crore.

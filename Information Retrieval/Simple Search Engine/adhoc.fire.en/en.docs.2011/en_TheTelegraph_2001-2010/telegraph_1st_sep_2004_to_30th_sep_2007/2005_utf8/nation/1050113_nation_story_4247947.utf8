 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Union environment ministry has set up an expert panel to scrutinise development proposals.

 The committee, headed by Paritosh C. Tyagi, former chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board, will assess the impact that new proposals like industrial townships, river valley and nuclear power projects and commercial complexes can have on the environment, especially in ecologically fragile areas. 

 The panel will cover 32 categories of activities. Last year, the ministry had issued a notification that made central clearance mandatory for all residential and industrial projects exceeding Rs 50 crore. 

 The committee will scrutinise project proposals and examine the environmental management plan submitted by the project authorities. If feasible, it will suggest safeguards to lessen adverse impact on the environment.

 The committee is expected to send its recommendations fast. Only exceptional cases will merit more than two sittings.

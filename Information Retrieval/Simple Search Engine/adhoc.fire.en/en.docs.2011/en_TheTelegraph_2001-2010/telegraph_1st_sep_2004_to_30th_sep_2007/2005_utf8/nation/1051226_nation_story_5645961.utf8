 Memorials for future recall

 Car Nicobar, Dec. 25: On the eve of the tsunamis first anniversary, the Nicobarese tribals have lined up a present for posterity.

 As the air force prepares to pull down the mauled buildings at the Carnic airbase, the tribal council ? a decision-making body of village elders ? has decided that some of them should be left as they are. They shall stand as memorials for future generations to see and learn what their forbears had gone through on December 26, 2004, and its aftermath.

 The elders have a strong reason for their decision. Tribal tradition has it that a devastating earthquake, followed by tsunami waves, had hit the islands way back in 1881, but no local records of the event survive.

 When I heard about it (the earlier tsunami) the first time, I decided to look for details, Nicobar deputy commissioner Vivek Porwal told The Telegraph today.

 Finally, I found evidence that on December 31, 1881, the islands had been hit by a tsunami. The earthquake, of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale, was followed by eight-metre-high waves.

 In 2002, Roger Bilham, an environmental scientist in Colorado, documented the Raj administrations descriptions of how the tsunami struck, damaging masonry barracks and the shoreline dam near Port Blair.

 Inland coconut trees on Car Nicobar island toppled (over) but shoreline trees remained standing, Bilham said in his research paper, of which this newspaper has a copy.

 When Porwal, an IAS officer from the Madhya Pradesh cadre, confirmed to the tribal council that there indeed had been a tsunami in 1881, the elders immediately sat down to identify a few buildings for preservation.

 Even I thought that some buildings should definitely be left as they are, so that the younger generation can see with their own eyes what had occurred here, Porwal said.

 With the help of the district administration, the tribal council has selected the devastated, two-storey Central Tribal Co-operative Society building near the village of Chuckchucha and the Mus school for preservation. Many had died in the society building complex and Mus village.

 Tribal council members, still trying to get their lives back on track after last years devastation, are helping the administration in whatever way they can in its efforts to preserve the buildings.

 They are the real tsunami memorials. They will be there for the entire world to see, council member Ibrahim Ali Hussain said.

 Bilham, while writing his research paper in 2002, had no inkling that tragedy would strike the islands again in a couple of years.

 On the morning of December 31, 1881, a submarine earthquake beneath the Andaman Islands generated a tsunami with a maximum crest height of 8 metres that was recorded by eight tide gauges surrounding the Bay of Bengal, he wrote.

 Since the earthquake occurred eight years before the construction of the worlds first teleseismic recording seismometer, little has been known about its rupture parameters or location.

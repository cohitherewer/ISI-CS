 Vaiko joins oil protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 26: Vaikos MDMK has announced an agitation against the Centre on July 4 over the hike in fuel prices and sharing of Cauvery waters.

 The demand for an immediate rollback in fuel prices comes hours after the rise was justified by DMK chief M. Karunanidhi. The CPM and the CPI, which are part of the state-level coalition along with Vaiko, are also agitating agai-nst the fuel price hike.

 The MDMK has decided to organise protests against the central and state governments in the delta areas of the Cauvery to press for the release of the rivers water.

 The MDMK also rejected the Centres argument that fuel prices had to be raised in view of rising international prices of crude. Vaiko said the price hike would affect all sections of the economy and hit farmers and small-scale industrialists the hardest. 

 He questioned why the Centre was not reducing excise duties on petrol and diesel, with the oil companies enjoying a monopoly in crude refining.

 He also opposed any move to sign a defence pact with Sri Lanka, including supply of defence equipment, as indicated during foreign minister K. Natwar Singhs recent visit to Colombo.

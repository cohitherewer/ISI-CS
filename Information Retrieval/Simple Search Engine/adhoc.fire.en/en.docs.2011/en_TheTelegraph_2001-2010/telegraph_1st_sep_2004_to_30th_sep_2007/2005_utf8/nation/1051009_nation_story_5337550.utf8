 BJP guns for gang of six

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: The BJP has identified the gang of six responsible for the rape of the Constitution in Bihar. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the Left feature in it. 

 BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan demanded that the Prime Minister apologise to the nation and sack governor Buta Singh.

 Mahajan levelled three allegations against the Prime Minister. Singh, he said, spoke of horse-trading in Bihar while tracking tigers in Ranthambore, but, in the process, he misled the country about what really happened in the run-up to the dissolution of the Assembly. 

 Second, he said the Prime Minister repeated the same charge in Parliament and misled the House as well. Third, he misled the President after the midnight cabinet meeting, where it was decided to place Bihar under central rule.

 He is guilty of three crimes. We expected the PM to sound contrite (in Chandigarh) but unfortunately, he said two things. First, I do not disown responsibility (for the decision to clamp central rule). Frankly, I cannot fathom such a reaction because did he have a choice but not to own up responsibility? 

 Second, he said he has to study the judgment. Khushwant Singh said of him that he is the most erudite PM India has had, so I can naturally understand why he wants to study the order. But the PM must also understand that this decision (to place Bihar under central rule) arose out of political considerations and it has political implications, Mahajan said.

 The BJP leader said Buta Singhs removal is the minimum price the Prime Minister will have to pay to make amends.

 If the BJP had yesterday targeted both Manmohan Singh and the governor, Mahajan today focused on the Prime Minister. 

 Asked if the National Democratic Alliance would bring a no-confidence vote against the government on Bihar in the winter session of Parliament, he said: Thats a long way off. At present, we will move a no-confidence motion against the UPA on behalf of the people of Bihar.

 The other members of Mahajans gang of six are the governor, home minister Shivraj Patil and RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav. 

 The BJP spared President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam though the Supreme Courts interim order referred to him. I will never comment on the President. He is the most honest, most popular and most non-political President we have had and I do not want to attribute political things to him, Mahajan said.

 An NDA delegation, led by BJP chief L.K. Advani and coalition convener George Fernandes, will call on Kalam on Monday.

 Trinamul turn after dark

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, May 20: With folded hands A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury appealed to the people, up to 3 pm, to vote for Congress candidates on Sunday.

 At 6 pm, three hours after the expiry of the deadline on the final day of campaigning today, he did the same in ward 16, seeking the blessings of the electorate for Trinamul Congress candidate Krishnendu Chowdhury.

 Please bless this boy, Ghani Khan appealed for an hour, Chowdhury by his side.

 The violation of election rules, however, has not gone down well with the CPM. District secretary Jiban Moitra lodged a complaint with district magistrate Abhijit Chowdhury urging him to take action against Ghani Khan. The district magistrate said he had ordered an inquiry.

 The high stakes in the battle for the Englishbazar municipality today saw CPM heavyweights, like Moitra and food-processing minister Sailen Sarkar, hit the streets to campaigning for the Left Front candidates.

 The people have had enough of the Congress and Trinamul Congress. They have decided to vote in our favour, Moitra said. 

 Incidentally, of the 25 wards, the CPM has won from one ward unopposed.

 The CPM district secretarys confident claims of a resounding victory in the poll, however, could not take away from the fact that Ghani Khans meetings today drew large crowds.

 Nandan Kanan tiger dies

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 24: A white tiger today died at Nandan Kanan Biological Park, sources said.

 Jawahar, the 15-year-old tiger, was being treated in the intensive care unit of the zoo hospital for the past fortnight. There were sores all over his body and some of the wounds had become septic, zoo sources said.

 Jawahar was born in the park in 1990. After his death, the zoo has 13 white tigers, five of whom are females.

 Though the officials denied that the prevailing heat wave led to the death of the tiger, the scorching summer has made life difficult for the animals in the zoo.

 Zoo director S.K. Sinha said they were taking special care special of all the inmates. We are giving the animals watermelon, mango, cucumber and coconut. Almost all mammal enclosures have been thatched with haystacks. Birdcages are being sprinkled with water. Besides, adequate drinking water is being supplied, he added.

 The heat wave has already killed 24 people as most parts of Orissa continue to sizzle. The western Orissa town of Jharsuguda today recorded a blistering 47 degrees Celsius.

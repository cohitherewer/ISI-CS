 Bhopal, June 9: A rain of chappals and a couple of burnt effigies.

 Two days after L.K. Advani stepped down as BJP chief, street fights mirrored the rift within the Sangh parivar as Bajrang Dal and BJP workers clashed in Indore. 

 In Indore city, Vishwa Hindu Parishad activists burnt an effigy of the leader once hailed as the BJPs lauh purush (iron man).

 Bajrang Dal workers mercilessly thrashed Prakash Parwani, a BJP member considered close to Indore Municipal Corporation chairman and senior party leader Shanker Lalwani, in the busy Rajwada area. Parwanis crime was he burnt an effigy of VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia, who has called Advani a traitor for praising Pakistans founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah. 

 Incensed Bajrang Dal activists also threatened other BJP workers, saying any disrespect to Hindu leaders like Togadia would result in similar treatment.

 The city BJP sought to underplay the incident, but Indore district Bajrang Dal convener Rajesh Bidkar proudly said: Around 150 of our workers took him to Rajwada raining chappals on him. Anyone emulating Parwani would meet the same fate.

 In Bhopal, too, angry VHP activists threw chappals at Advanis posters. On Tuesday, after Advani had stepped down, VHP activists distributed laddoos in Indore and burst crackers to celebrate.

 Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur, who is in Delhi, distanced himself from Advanis comments. Gaur, the second BJP leader after Yashwant Sinha to go public against Advanis statements, said Jinnah was neither secular nor a centre of respect in India and the RSS and the VHP were free to take a stand as per their ideals and policies.

 If he (Jinnah) had been secular, he would never have got the country divided on the basis of religion, the chief minister said before he left for the capital. Thousands of Hindus had to leave Pakistan and take shelter in India due to the venomous seeds sown by Jinnah in the name of religion. Lakhs of people were slaughtered. 

 Gaurs remarks were in sharp contrast to his earlier stand before Advani resigned. On June 6, he had termed the comments diplomatic and appealed to Hindu outfits to understand that Advani was merely asking Pakistan to become secular.

 Advani wants Pakistan to become a secular country. He was asking the nation to become a secular country so that Hindus, Sikhs and Christians can live peacefully, as per Jinnahs wishes, Gaur had said.

 Bajrang Dal leader Devendra Singh Rawat said Advani had hurt the sentiments of 90 crore Hindus by praising the communal and anti-national Jinnah.

 Verdict storm brews

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Congress and the BJP stood on opposite sides of the fence on yesterdays high court ruling on Aligarh Muslim University, with one party calling for a legal challenge and the other welcoming the verdict.

 The Congress said the university and the Union human resource development ministry should appeal against the high court order.

 The AMU is a minority institution. That has been its character in law for the last 24 years after Parliament amended the AMU statute in 1981. This character has to be preserved and respected, party spokesperson Anand Sharma said.

 The party appears to have been taken aback by the sweeping nature of the judgment. Sharma said the issue had come to the high court in the limited context of a decision taken earlier this year to reserve 50 per cent of some postgraduate seats at the university for Muslims. Upholding the challenge to that order, the court also quashed the minority character of the institution, he said.

 Braving criticism from some sections, including Left academics, the Congress and the Union HRD ministry had endorsed the reservation of 50 per cent seats in postgraduate medical courses by the university.

 The party today said the court order should be challenged either in a larger bench of the high court or in the Supreme Court. 

 But the BJP welcomed the courts decision to quash the reservation and asked the government to annul the universitys minority status, arguing that religion-based reservations hurt national unity.

 The government has committed a sin as it tried to convert the AMU into a madarsa, party vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said. The government should cancel its reservation order that is purely aimed at damaging the original secular foundations of the AMU. The government should desist from coming out with a legislation to nullify the judgment, which is what they did in the Shah Bano case, he added.

 Naqvi accused the government of using religion-based reservation to further its political interests. 

 The decision to allow reservation for Muslims in the AMU is a roadblock in the way of the communitys economic betterment. Who would give jobs to students who have passed out from a university that has seat reservations? he asked. But for the Congress, the AMU has always been an arena to play politics on.

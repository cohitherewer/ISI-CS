 Channel deadline 

 New Delhi, April 8: The cabinet today gave news and current affairs television channels time till September to raise the equity base of Indian partners to 51 per cent, reports our special correspondent. 

 The deadline was first set for March 2004, but on requests from channels the Centre has been extending it every six months. 

 But today, the cabinet said the channels would either have to restructure or lose their licences.

 ?The policy requires the news channels to adhere to a cap of 26 per cent for foreign direct investment and the Indian entity to have not less than 51 per cent. But for a variety of reasons, many existing news channels have not been able to conform to this changed system,? information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy said after a cabinet meeting. 

 ?There will be no further extensions.? 

 Today?s decision will also give the ministry time to finalise the proposal to review the uplinking guidelines.

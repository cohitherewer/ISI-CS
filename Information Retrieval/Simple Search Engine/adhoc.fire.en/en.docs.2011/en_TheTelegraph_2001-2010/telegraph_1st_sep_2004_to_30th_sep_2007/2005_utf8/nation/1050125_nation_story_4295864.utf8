 Throw-buster cops on trains

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 24: Railway authorities have decided to deploy police in plain clothes to put an end to recurring incidents of passengers being pushed off unreserved compartments, a high-ranking official said today.

 The move comes a day after five civilians were killed after soldiers allegedly hurled them out of an unreserved coach into the path of a speeding train on an adjacent track. The incident occurred near Shikohabad station in Firozabad district of western Uttar Pradesh.

 On January 26 last year, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s grandnephew died after being thrown off the Chhattisgarh Express. Though railway police had stepped up security, they have failed to check such incidents.

 ?We have decided to strengthen general security at all stations between Kanpur and Mathura following yesterday?s incident. Plainclothes police would also be deployed in unreserved coaches to keep a watch on unruly elements,? senior security commissioner, North Central Railway, S.K. Singh said in Allahabad after a meeting to work out a plan to bring unreserved coaches, which usually go without any security, under police cover.

 DIG (railways) A.D Mishra, who visited Shikohabad, said the arrested jawans have been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The four have been identified as havildar Joginder Singh and lance naiks Pradeep Kumar and Vijendra Kumar ? all from Rajputana Rifles ? and Dipobal Biswas, a jawan from the BSF?s Jammu unit.

 The four were produced in a Firozabad court and remanded in judicial custody for a week. A team of army officers, which reached Shikohabad to investigate the incident, filed a petition to take the jawans into custody. The petition will be heard tomorrow.

 Besides the four arrested, the police are looking for six others and have sought a list of jawans from a camp in Faizabad where they had gone for training. The jawans had boarded from Faizabad.

 In Delhi, army public relations officer Col S.K. Sakhuja said a ?court of inquiry? has been ordered into the ?unfortunate? incident and stringent action would be taken if the jawans are found guilty.

 A day after the tragedy, witnesses came out with detailed accounts of the circumstances leading to the deadly fracas on the Delhi-bound Farakka Express. Lakhim Chandra, father of one of the victims, told the police the jawans refused to let them in when they boarded the coach at Etawah. ?But we, me and my son Mahesh, managed to take a seat near the window. When we refused to disembark at the next station, they first abused us and then began kicking us,? the 56-year-old said.

 ?Two jawans hit me in my face and pushed me into a corner. My son and four others were pushed near the edge of a door. When the train, which was nearing Shikohabad station, slowed down, some more passengers got in. The jawans got more furious and began pushing all of us. In the jostling, six passengers, including my son, fell off. I could see him being crushed by another train.? Lakhim is one of 16 witnesses who have deposed before the police.

 Stinker for Nepal but door still ajar

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: India today described King Gyanendra?s coup in Nepal as a ?violation of the constitution? but refused to make restoration of democracy a precondition for resuming engagement with Kathmandu.

 Delhi acknowledged that yesterday?s development did not come as a total surprise. ?We had repeatedly expressed our concern to the king that any attempt to marginalise the democratic forces will give more ground to the Maoists,? foreign secretary Shyam Saran said.

 India demanded the release of all political leaders taken into custody in Nepal and lifting of the emergency imposed by the palace. But Saran clarified that Delhi was not setting ?any benchmarks? for re-engaging with the neighbour.

 The Indian stand shows that Delhi does not want to be caught in a position where it has no links with the palace.

 The fear that the king may be forced to seek help from other international players if pushed beyond a point is perhaps the reason why India has kept a small window open for him.

 Though ?political turmoil? in Nepal was one of the reasons India cited for not attending the Saarc summit in Dhaka, Saran clarified that the possibility of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sharing the dais with Gyanendra was not part of the logic. He emphasised India has in the past shared the Saarc stage with many leaders who were not democratically elected.

 But Saran argued that the turmoil in Nepal was bound to have a negative impact on India as the two countries share an open border. Indications are that India is making additional deployments to strengthen the porous border. 

 The Maoists of Nepal have asked the people to defy Gyanendra?s ?so-called proclamation? and join a people?s movement against the ?autocratic? ruler. ?We heartily call upon the pro-people forces of the world to raise voice against this autocratic step and in favour of Nepalese people?s democratic movement,? rebel leader Prachanda said in a statement that was also made available in Delhi.

 The rebels urged the soldiers and government officials to join their revolt and asked every Nepalese citizen to ?shut down? Nepal for three days from today in protest.

 Saran said India was unable to make a proper assessment of the situation as all communication links were cut off since yesterday. The only connection between South Block and the embassy in Kathmandu has been a satellite telephone. 

 Two Indian Airlines flights, Saran said, were allowed into Kathmandu to bring back ?stranded? Indian passengers.

 Chasing justice, for slain nanny goat

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Sept. 19: Shakuntala Devi has been knocking on the doors of the womens commission here, but not for herself.

 She wants justice for a four-legged friend ? a nanny goat, which was brutally killed last month.

 For the past one month, the 32-year-old has been coming all the way from Mainpuri, 210 km from here, to attend sittings of the Uttar Pradesh womens commission, ignoring taunts of neighbours who have begun calling her bakri ki ma, or mother of a goat.

 The taunts are not confined to Mainpuri, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs former constituency. In state capital Lucknow, where a motley crowd gathers every time she attends the sessions of the commission to plead her case, she is called Mainpuri ki Maneka, a reference to animal rights activist and former Union minister Maneka Gandhi.

 Asked why she had chosen to approach the womens commission, pat came the reply. When women are battered to death they come here, but when a she-goat had to die because of a murderous assault by a neighbour, who is a man, where is one supposed to go? And it is a woman who is an affected party here, she said.

 According to the report that Mainpuri police submitted to the commission, the goat had one August morning strayed into a neighbours farm. When the owner of the land, Raju, and his men found out that it had eaten a couple of radishes, they caught the goat and hit it with a blunt iron rod. The goat died of the wounds three days later.

 For three days she lay groaning in pain. It made me cry to watch its agonising end, Shakuntala told the commission before breaking down.

 It would, at the most, have eaten one or two radishes, she said between sobs. What was the need to kill it?

 As the young village woman cried, the people around tried hard to hide their smiles. But her tears touched a chord among animal lovers.

 Her feelings are genuine and instinct urban, said Anita Singh, an animal lover and activist in Lucknow.

 Most of the members on the womens panel are sympathetic, but are at a loss how to bring the culprits to book. Goats are not protected animals.

 At best, the accused could be fined, said Geeta Singh, one of the members.

 Delhi flood relief salve on Dhaka

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Feb 11: In an attempt to smooth ruffled feathers in Dhaka following India?s decision to stay away from the Saarc summit, Delhi today extended a Rs 100-crore relief assistance to flood-hit Bangladesh.

 A memorandum of understanding was signed this afternoon between foreign secretary Shyam Saran and Bangladesh high commissioner in Delhi, Hemayatuddin. The relief will be used by Bangladesh to procure foodgrain, medicines and building material from India.

 The assistance was to be given when the foreign minister travelled to Dhaka to attend the senior ministers? meeting preceding the Saarc summit. But the summit was called off at India?s initiative.

 ?The assistance is in the strong tradition of India extending a hand of friendship and material assistance, within its means, to victims of natural disasters in friendly and neighbouring countries,? said a statement issued by the foreign ministry.

 Bangladesh has not formally lodged its displeasure over the scuttling of the Saarc summit. But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s portrait has been taken off from the street leading to the International Friendship Centre in Dhaka where the summit was to be held. Portraits of all the other six Saarc leaders are still up.

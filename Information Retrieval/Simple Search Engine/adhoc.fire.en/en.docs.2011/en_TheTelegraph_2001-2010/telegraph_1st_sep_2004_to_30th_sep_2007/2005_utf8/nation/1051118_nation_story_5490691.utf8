 No entry for don lawyer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 17: Abu Salems plea that he be interrogated by the CBI within hearing distance of his lawyers was rejected by the special Tada court today.

 Judge P.D. Kode said the basis for the application, that the CBI would force Salem to make a confession, was based on speculation and was premature.

 But the court said Salems lawyers could still apply to the CBIs investigating officer and it would be up to him to allow them to be present during interrogation.

 The courts rejection appears to be a boost for the CBI, though allowing lawyers during interrogation would be an exceptional court order.

 Salems lawyers had cited a Supreme Court order in a case involving former Orissa chief minister Nandini Satpathy. Satpathy had been arrested under the Prevention of Corruption Act in 1978 and was to be interrogated by a vigilance officer. The Supreme Court ruled that she had a right to silence and could have a lawyer by her side.

 Salems counsel said the apex court had allowed Satpathys lawyers within hearing distance.

 But the CBI argued that the circumstances of the two cases were different as they were being tried under different acts. During Satpathys case, Tada had not come into being.

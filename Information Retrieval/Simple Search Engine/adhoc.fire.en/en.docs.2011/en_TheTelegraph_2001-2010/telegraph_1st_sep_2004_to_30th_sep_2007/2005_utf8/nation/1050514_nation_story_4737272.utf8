 Speaker muzzles Left

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, May 13: You cant be serious.

 Thats more or less the response two CPM leaders got today as they squared up to oppose the finance ministers banking reforms in the Lok Sabha.

 It wasnt P. Chidambaram scoffing at their ideological baggage. Nor was it the reformist Manmohan Singh ? he had already promised to let the CPM have its say on the subject.

 It was Speaker Somnath Chatterjee shutting up senior members of his own party. On an issue the whole of the Left most eagerly wanted to discuss in the House.

 CPM leaders had yesterday told the Prime Minister and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi they would not support the banking reforms. Singh had assured them a full-fledged discussion in Parliament on the entire gamut of financial sector reforms. 

 So, as soon as Chidambaram moved the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, Roopchand Pal and Basudev Acharia ? the leader of the CPM in the Lok Sabha ? were off the block.

 Till Chatterjee decided they were not serious about the issue they were protesting against.

 His reason was simple: The notice served by the MPs ? both veterans with two decades of parliamentary experience behind them ? did not state their reasons for opposing the bill, as required. 

 You are a party to the rule committee. You know you have to give reasons for opposing the bill, Chatterjee admonished them.

 If you were serious, you would have served a proper notice. Do not make me say things, he warned darkly.

 The MPs made the mistake of appealing to him to relax the rules.

 The Speaker couldnt believe his ears: First you ignore the rules, next you pressurise the Chair!

 We are not pressurising. We are only appealing to you to relax the rule, argued one of the MPs.

 Chatterjee was unmoved. I would have listened to you had you been new MPs. But both of you are experienced and competent MPs. You have knowingly done all this.

 CPI member Gurudas Dasgupta came to the aid of his CPM colleagues. You can relax the rules, he advised the Speaker.

 Could he be serious? Chatterjee looked incredulous.

 What are you saying? he exclaimed. You have not even given a notice!

 Chatterjee read out the CPM members notices which merely said they were opposing the banking bill. He next read out from the rulebook.

 It said MPs wishing to speak against a bill must serve notice before 10 am on the day the legislation is moved in the House. The notice has to state substantive reasons challenging the legislative competence of the bill.

 All that the Left MPs could do was condense the speeches they had planned into a single line: We shall oppose the bill tooth and nail inside and outside Parliament.

 Boycott appeal

 Parliament was adjourned sine die today as the three-month budget session came to a close. Chatterjee appealed to the Opposition, which boycotted most of the session, to start a new chapter and return to Parliament when it reassembles for the monsoon session.

 Kashmiris cautious on Delhi talks

 Srinagar, Sept. 6: Kashmiris today reacted cautiously to the hope the Prime Minister held out to the Hurriyat but the state government rattled their confidence by booking nine activists under the Public Safety Act.

 Aasiya Andrabi, chief of the Dukhtaran-e-Milat that has been aggressively campaigning against sex workers in Srinagar, was booked along with eight of her activists. She was arrested last week during a raid her group made on a city hotel and lodged in the womens police station.

 See, Aasiya Andrabi has been booked only a day after Delhi promised to release detainees, said Syed Ali Shah Geelani, chairman of the hardline faction of the Hurriyat.

 Last night, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had agreed to review the cases of detainees and ensure safeguards against human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir.

 Local people said while the talks could not be dismissed as a non-event, one could not live on the euphoria they created either. Things have to be tested on the ground, said a Kashmir observer. After all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

 A college lecturer, Abdul Rashid, was a little more hopeful. He said the moderate Hurriyat has met senior Indian leaders in the past but the extra mile the UPA government walked by allowing the leaders to visit Pakistan and later inviting them for talks indicated the seriousness with which Singh was engaging the separatist politicians.

 Even if we sweep the dust under the carpet for a century, there will still have to be talks. It may take longer for results to show but there is no alternative to dialogue, said Mohammed Abdullah, a supporter of Mirwaiz Umer Farooq.

 A shopkeeper in Lal Chowk said it was a fingers-crossed situation. Unless the CBMs are concretised, nothing is definite either about the fate of the present talks or about the future, said Mehraj-ud-Din.

 Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed termed the talks a good beginning as it had restarted the dialogue process.

 APHC leaders had earlier held talks with then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani but the difference between now and then is that this time Pakistan is also supportive of the dialogue. This is a positive development that would promote the ongoing peace process.

 He said he had never claimed that human rights violations had stopped but such incidents had drastically dipped since his government took charge.

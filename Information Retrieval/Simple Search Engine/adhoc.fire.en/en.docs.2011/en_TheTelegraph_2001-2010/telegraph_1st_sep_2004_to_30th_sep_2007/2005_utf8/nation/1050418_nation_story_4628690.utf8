 New Delhi, April 17: The peace initiative with Pakistan is right on track with the two sides today agreeing to establish their second rail link in December between Munabao in Rajasthan and Khokrapar in Sindh and reviving a joint commission on economic issues that has not met since 1989.

 The decisions were taken at a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf at Hyderabad House that went on for over two hours.

 The two countries also discussed the possibility of opening more routes for trade and transport links. In January 2004, the two sides reopened the Lahore-Attari (Amritsar) rail link after a two-year suspension of the Samjhauta Express.

 Last October, talks began on the Munabao-Khokrapar rail link. It had closed in 1965 after war broke out with Pakistan. India had offered to resume the rail link from October 2 this year but the Pakistani side had declined to commit to a clear deadline.

 Last December, railway officials of the two countries met in Islamabad to discuss the modalities of reopening the rail link.

 Islamabad had sought more time since it wanted to change the 127-km rail track between Khokrapar and Mirphurkas from narrow gauge to broad gauge to make it compatible with Indian tracks.

 Singh spies moment of history

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: There was a reference to the flavour of the day: the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. There was a call to make history and a celebration of the here and now.

 Past, present and future blended as the Prime Minister addressed the nation from the Red Forts ramparts on Independence Day to list his governments achievements over the past one year and outline his vision for the next four.

 Manmohan Singh said the right things about the right kind of people, avoided major policy announcements and, barring one veiled reference to Pakistan and terrorism, stayed clear of controversy.

 His speech was peppered with talk of the aam admi (common man), who the Congresss rank and file felt was getting lost in the maze of debates over privatisation, divestment and economic reforms.

 Underlying Singhs tone of political correctness was a sense that this was his moment to make history, just as Bahadur Shah Zafar had done in more turbulent times, declaring a war of Independence from the Red Fort in 1857.

 The battle cry of Rani of Jhansi Lakshmi Bai, Peshwa Nana Saheb, Tantia Tope and Begum Hazrat Mahal of Lucknow was Delhi chalo. This cry was renewed with vigour and force by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and, in 1947, this ambition was fulfilled. Today, we have the opportunity of remembering their sacrifices, the Prime Minister said.

 And an opportunity, like them, to shape the future.

 There comes a time in the history of a nation when it can be said that the time has come to make history. We are today at the threshold of such an era, Singh said. The world wants us to do well and take our rightful place on the world stage. There are no external constraints on our development. If there are any hurdles, they are internal.

 Singh did not identify the internal hurdles but earlier in the speech, he had called for more open and honest governance. 

 There is a need to change the manner in which governments function. There is no space in our government or in our society for corruption and arbitrary action, Singh said.

 Government servants must work with a sense of public service and they should be held accountable to the people. Governments will have to be made more transparent and accountable. The recently passed Right to Information Act is a landmark step in this direction.

 The Prime Minister walked the tightrope on industry. He hoped the government can provide a social security net for workers, particularly those in the unorganised sector. At the same time, he wanted workers to co-operate with their management so that profitability? increases and they also benefit from this.

 Singh said he is ready to invite anyone to discuss Kashmirs problems but warned that if violence continues, then our response, too, will be hard. His message to Pakistan was that half-hearted efforts will not do: It is necessary that the entire infrastructure of terrorism is totally dismantled.

 Among the promises Singh held out were job creation ? he improvised Indira Gandhis garibi hatao slogan to rozgar badhao ? the development of a dedicated freight corridor between Delhi and Calcutta as well as between Delhi and Mumbai with a Rs 25,000-crore investment, land rights for forest dwellers and a Prime Ministers scholarship for soldiers children.

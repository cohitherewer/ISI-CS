 Indian car earns British kudos 

 - REVA NAMED MOST ETHICAL VEHICLE

 A Reva rolls in Bangalore 

 An Indian-made electrical car, known as Reva G-Wiz and manufactured by a firm in Bangalore, has been named the most ethical vehicle on the roads in the UK by Ethical Consumer magazine.

 About 20 companies which make environmentally friendly cars were tested by the magazine but the Indian entry, about 200 of which have sold in Britain since it was marketed a year ago, came out on top.

 Owners do not have to pay a road tax on the car (well over ?100 a year) nor a congestion charge of ?5 a day for driving into central London. Parking is also free in designated areas.

 It is sold in Britain through a company called GoinGreen, whose managing director, Keith Johnston, told The Telegraph today that a colleague came across the car in 2002 in India, where nearly 800 have been sold. GoinGreen signed an exclusive contract with the Bangalore firm, RECC.

 After India, the biggest sales have been in London, said Johnston.

 GoinGreen, which was named Business of the Year last year in the awards for start-up companies, does not have showrooms but relies for sales on the Internet plus word of mouth. On the road, the Reva G-Wiz seats two adults and two children and costs ?6,999. We believe this is the electrical car of the future, he added.

 Comments from satisfied customers certainly seem flattering.

 Its now six months since I first got my G-Wiz and I feel compelled to write to you to let you know how it has changed my life, commented Alex Dee, of London NW3. The convenience of being able to park in central London at virtually no cost, combined with the ability to park in the smallest of spaces is incredible. In particular, the flexibility of having a car in London and not be reliant on the unreliable Tube is like discovering a new freedom.

 Janet Digby-Baker, of London E3, said: I had not prepared myself for the fact that the G-Wiz would save me ?100 per week in parking.

 Tony Robinson, of London SW6, revealed: I took delivery of my wifes G-Wiz about a week ago. It is a magic little car. I get enormous pleasure now of driving into Westminster, giving the congestion charge cameras a V sign and parking for free! Hope you sell lots of these!

 And Howard Carter, of London W11, gushed: The main benefit of a G-Wiz is of course environmental, but in practical terms this automobile really shines. It feels good to drive, is very quiet, has more room than a smart car, gets more looks than my old sports car, people are constantly smiling at me and parking problems disappeared on delivery ? I love my electric car.

 At this rate, India may have come up with something more popular than on-song Sachin and Sehwag combined.

 The car is charged electrically from a normal 220V socket and can drive for 40 miles at a top speed of 40mph. At Monaco, GoinGreen displayed a prototype ? the NXG (the next generation) ? capable of 75mph and a 125-mile range. The Reva NXG is a collaborative effort between the Bangalore firm, RECC, designer Dilip Chhabria of DC Design and Simputer developer Encore Software.

 Ethical Consumer magazine describes itself as the UKs leading alternative consumer magazine. It is published six times a year and contains practical guides to a range of products, from banks and building societies to yoghurt.

 Mary Rayner of Ethical Consumer explained that the two-door hatchback came top of the magazines ethiscore which is worked out according to a number of different factors. She said: We look at CO2 emissions, workers rights, what the company is like environmentally and whether they are involved in arms manufacturing or nuclear power.

 The magazine gives the Indian car a huge plug: For anyone living in an urban area and mainly using a car for short trips, the Reva G-Wiz is recommended as a Best Buy.

 Bitter fruits of victory and defeat

 For both the victor and the vanquished, the Bihar results present new problems.

 Nitish Kumar, who led the Janata Dal (United)-BJP alliance to the stunning win, got to the victory stand by successfully placating those who feared change in Bihar and kept intact the core vote base built up in successive NDA campaigns.

 This is the first NDA win ever in an Assembly poll, though it prevailed as recently as 1999 in a Lok Sabha election in the state when it led in as many as 146 Assembly segments. 

 Nitishs vote base is a disparate one, for he continues to enjoy the consolidated support of the forward classes. This will pose a challenge as he comes to terms with conflicting aspirations of his constituents.

 The EBCs will want a share of power. Having given them the maximum tickets, he will have to satisfy their aspirations. Conversely, the upper castes will want their comeuppance after a decade and half of smarting under Yadav dominance. 

 The new regime will be torn not only between conflicting claims on its agenda. It will also face a resurgent Maoist movement emboldened by the Jehanabad outbreak, not to mention the Ranbir Sena, which will exult over Lalu Prasads exit.

 New dilemmas will present themselves before the UPA, too. If the NDA government in Bihar lodges fresh cases against Lalu Prasad, it will pose a problem for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Bihar has long been Indias political laboratory. Jayaprakash Narayans movement set the stage for Indira Gandhis downfall. Mandal struck a chord here as nowhere else in the country. It has often been claimed that Bihar is the state that shows India the way. The NDA would be hoping so.

 Bangalore braces for Jaya

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, March 13: Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa, facing charges of unaccounted wealth, will stand trial in a special court here tomorrow. 

 The ADMK chief, who is likely to face the heat in the run-up to next year?s polls on her home turf because of the case, will appear before Justice A.S. Pachhapure in a courtroom that is being fortified following a request from the Tamil Nadu home department.

 Commissioner of police Siddaiah Mariswamy has reviewed security arrangements at the civil court complex.

 ?We are going to make elaborate security arrangements here because we have received a request from the home department. This court hall is on one floor, but we will make sure that our security ring does not come in the way of other cases in this complex. Perhaps, we will limit the number of people entering the special court hall to keep onlookers and party workers out,? he said.

 Sources said sleuths had been tipped-off that a grand reception was being planned for the chief minister in the court complex. ?We cannot take chances as partymen will try to breach the cordon and enter the court to shout slogans in support of their leader,? a source said.

 The courtroom, which has 150 seats, will be modified to hold 400 people, officials said. 

 Translators will also be at hand to assist the court on statements made in Tamil by witnesses and officials summoned by Justice Pachhapure. The translation of 17,000 pages of records and documents from Tamil to English has been completed.

 Former Karnataka advocate-general B.V. Acharya will act as public prosecutor.

 The court has also summoned her associates, Sasikala Natarajan and Illavarasan tomorrow, officials said.

 Jayalalithaa will be tried under the Prevention of Corruption Act on charges of accumulating Rs 65.66 crore during her tenure as chief minister between 1991 and 1996.

 The case was shifted from a special court in Chennai to Bangalore in November 2003 after the Supreme Court issued an order on a plea by K. Anbazhagan. The DMK general secretary had alleged that 64 witnesses had turned hostile after Jayalalithaa became chief minister for the second time in 2001.

 The apex court also said the Bangalore court could summon any witness, including those who had turned hostile.

 On January 18, the Supreme Court turned down her plea to move the case to a special court in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala or Pondicherry. Jayalalithaa had claimed that the ?atmosphere? in Bangalore was ?hostile? because of the Cauvery water row and that Karnataka would not lend itself to ?the kind of tranquillity and calm as required for a fair and free trial?.

 The appeal was dismissed by a constitution bench of the apex court.

 Bhubaneswar, May 2: The panchayati raj department has planned to develop at least 15 km of all-weather roads in each of the 6,234 gram panchayats and provide pipe water to villages.

 Panchayati raj minister Damodar Rout said he has directed the authorities concerned to identify arterial metal roads, connecting either panchayats or block headquarters, for their conversion into all-weather roads.

 The department has requested the 147 MLAs and 31 MPs to contribute Rs 15 lakh each from their local area development funds.

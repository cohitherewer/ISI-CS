 Love pips faith at last rites 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, March 28: She is a devout Muslim. He was a Hindu who had converted to Islam.

 Yesterday, Rubina kept her husband Tanaji Patil?s last wish ? she cremated him according to Hindu rites. ?I felt I had to do this to fulfil his last wish,? she said.

 Tanaji had changed his faith to marry the woman he had fallen in love with, but after he fell seriously ill about two months ago, he expressed a desire to be cremated the Hindu way. ?Whatever one might say, I will have the courage to meet his eyes up there,? said Rubina, looking up at the sky.

 The shadows had lengthened across the Chola Road cremation ground when Rubina, the first Muslim woman to perform her husband?s last rites, lit the funeral pyre. Her Hindu neighbours, in the lowbrow Gondipura area of Bhopal, who remained with Rubina along with her father and brother till the last flames had died into a heap of ashes, hailed the 43-year-old mother of two young daughters.

 Her gesture, said Naresh Jatav, a former Bhopal civic councillor, is a ?living example of the country?s composite culture?.

 But the Vishwa Hindu Parishad was aghast. ?She had no right to do that,? said VHP district chief Dipak Khandelwal. ?We do not even recognise her as Tanaji?s lawful wife. Where does the question of her lighting the funeral pyre arise??

 Rubina, a lower division clerk in a government department, and Tanaji, who was in his late forties, had married 12 years ago. Though her family accepted their marriage, solemnised by a nikaah, Tanaji?s family had cut off all links with him. There was no one from his family at the cremation ground yesterday. Rubina, however, said Tanaji?s brother was coming down from Maharashtra to collect the ?asthis? (ashes) which would be immersed in the Kshipra in Ujjain.

 Rubina?s act has renewed the debate over women?s rights to perform last rites. Two years ago, in July 2003, Sandhya had triggered a controversy when she performed the last rites of her father at Kshipra Ghat in Ujjain.

 A recent all-India meet of priests and religious leaders had failed to come to a conclusion on the issue. A powerful section of conservative priests is said to have blocked official sanction, saying it would go against the spirit of Hinduism.

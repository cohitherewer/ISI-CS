 Dalai Lama off Pak pitch

 Dharamsala, Feb. 28 (PTI): A potential political row was averted today with the Dalai Lama opting out of the inauguration of the three-day Indo-Pak match beginning here on March 3 in view of reservations reportedly expressed by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

 ?The general thinking of (the) Dalai Lama is not to cause inconvenience to any party,? Thupten Samphel, secretary in the department of information and international relations, said in a statement.

 The matter came to the fore when media reports said the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had reservations over the Dalai Lama inaugurating the tour opener against the Board President?s XI as the country enjoys good ties with China.

 PCB director Abbas Zaidi was today quoted as saying in a Pakistani newspaper that the team ?will not take part in any social activity, even those involving the Lama? during its stay in India.

 The Tibetan spiritual leader had earlier accepted the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association?s invitation to inaugurate the match. 

 The governor V.S. Kokje would do the honours now.

 Rat test hope for human heart

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: A new technique that involves injecting tiny fibres directly into the heart muscles to deliver a special protein can prevent heart failure in rats, Harvard Medical School researchers announced today.

 Their studies on rats suggest that this technique may potentially benefit those who have had heart attacks. But they cautioned that many more studies would be required to see if it can be used on humans.

 In their experiments, Richard Lee and his colleagues at the cardiovascular division of Harvard Medical School used tiny nanofibres ? unique biomaterials with potential applications in the regeneration of tissues ? to carry a growth-stimulating protein called PDGF-BB into the heart muscles of rats. They found the injections protected the rats heart muscles and prevented heart failure.

 Blood vessels that have narrowed because of blocks are unable to deliver adequate oxygen to heart muscles that can lead to death of the muscle, loss of a segment of the heart wall and, eventually, heart failure. A study of 96 rats showed that injecting nanofibres with PDGF-BB decreased the death of heart muscle fibres and preserved heart function after heart attacks, the scientists wrote in the Journal of Clinical Investigations.

 The PDGF-BB growth factor has a direct, pro-survival effect on heart muscles. However, their studies also showed that the protective effect of this growth factor could not be achieved when nanofibres or PDGF-BB is injected alone.

 When delivered through the nanofibres, the PDGF-BB remained biologically active in the heart after 14 days of the injection, the scientists wrote. They believe that nanofibres serve as a reservoir for the slow release of PDGF-BB.

 In another set of experiments, they showed that injection of nanofibres carrying the PGDF-BB growth factor 60 minutes following ischaemia ? a condition in which blood flow to the heart is constricted ? preserved heart function.

 These studies suggest that this approach may potentially benefit victims of heart attacks. But the researchers have pointed out that the study did not define the therapeutic window after the heart attacks ? for successful therapy.

 Additional studies should be performed to determine this therapeutic window, both in rats and in other species, they said.

The Oxytown murder case is set to be reopened, with the brother of one of the victims filing an appeal in the high court against the acquittal of the accused.

 The state, too, has decided to challenge the trial court order, which it thinks is biased and baseless.

 The murders on June 9, 1999, had wiped out the Pal family of Oxytown, in Behala. The decomposed bodies of Sohini, 22, Triparna, 16, Manjulika, 51, and Bidyut, 55, were recovered from their house five days later, after neighbours complained of a foul smell.

 Police had alleged that the murder was masterminded by Lakshmi Narayan Chakraborty, who was Sohinis tutor and with whom she reportedly had an affair. 

 According to the prosecution, Chakraborty hired Chandan Das to carry out the murders after Sohini, who had become pregnant, pressed him for marriage.

 In March 29, the Alipore court acquitted both Chakraborty and Das for lack of evidence.

 The appeal petition filed by Triptimoy Pal, the elder brother of Bidyut, however, claims that there was enough evidence to prove the guilt of the duo.

 Public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said the state was preparing to challenge the acquittal order. 

 Both petitions will be heard within a week, said Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, counsel for Triptimoy.

 Price of a missed call

 Does anyone make a missed call in any other country? Food for thought, but a telephone booth near Belghoria rail station has decreed that making such a call is not free any more. The booth is charging Rs 2 for a missed call. The reason is interesting and complex. 

 Belghoria, because of its location Sealdah is 15 minutes away on train has the largest concentration among suburbs of messes for students and service-holders from the lower-middle income bracket. Letting out of rooms is a secondary source of income for most house-owners in the area. Rooms are available for about one-third of the rent charged in Calcutta.

 Most of these mess-inmates are single and male. And with their share of women friends. But the landlords and ladies are often not that understanding. 

 Girlfriends are not allowed in the gentlemens messes that crowd Belghoria. So the girlfriends would do the next best thing give a missed call from a nearby booth. But the practice was so frequently indulged in that the booth-owners caught on and began to charge them.

 We have been forced to impose charges on missed calls. When there was no charge, at least 30 to 40 missed calls would be made from each of the booths daily. After they are charged, the number of such calls from a booth has come down to 10 or 12 daily, says S. Ghosh, a booth operator at Belghoria Station Road. 

 Moral? Theres no such thing as a free call. 

 Coffee corner

 Another NGO has set up shop, and there is coffee to boost interest. Ashayalam Handicrafts and Coffeeshop, on 44 Mirza Galib, aka Free School Street, is tailor-made for foreigners out for a dose of spirituality.

 Orange walls and the requisite ethnic bamboo chairs, a slightly worn copy of a Lonely Planet guide to India, Jhumpa Lahiris The Namesake, along with literature on Ashayalam, greet the backpacker and the occasional curious visitor.

 A showroom for articles made by the inmates of Ashayalam homes, it has decorative candles, woollens, diaries made of handmade paper, wall-hangers and embroidery on offer.

 Step into the air-conditioned interiors and take a bite of the chocolate and zebra cookies, also made by them, and wet parched throats with a cup of coffee, tea or a bottle of soft drink. Last month, Ashayalam played host to an evening of baul-fakir music by Calcutta Cycle, which was earlier known as Tihai. 

 Art and imitation 

 How has globalisation influenced contemporary Indian art? In the global village will the practitioners of our country imitate their counterparts in the West? These and other uncomfortable issues are raised in the collection of essays written by Rabin Mondal in his recently-published book of essays titled Shilpabhabana.

 Mondal is known for the uncompromising nature of his work. Now he has proved his strength as a prose writer too. He writes about growing up in Howrah, his illness in boyhood, about how the language of the visual arts should be different from that of literature.

 Of particular interest are his essays on Nirode Mazumdar, Nikhil Biswas and Amina Kar and the contribution of Jamini Roy. In a country where we never question past masters, Mondal calls for a reassessment of the artist who had appropriated the simple lines of folk art. These writings afford a glimpse of the camaraderie among artists before market forces came into play.

 The drawings of Rabin Mondal add to the attraction of this book that ought to have been better edited. At times it is so repetitive particularly when Mondal writes about the early days of his career that one wishes somebody had run the blue pencil ruthlessly through the text.

 The Baboo amp; the boil

 It was 1899 and an Englishman fresh from a salty voyage to the capital of British India was walking the busy streets and crowds of a Thurumthulla (Esplanade for the uninitiated). 

 India is a land of lies, inhabited by peoples who express a virtuous indignation against lying, he scribbled in his notebook. 

 But he was still unsure of what he had written and kept wishing for the snake-charmers, magic carpets and elephants he had imagined hovering on the paved walks.

 As he accidentally trod on the toes of a Baboo, our sahib was awed and crushed by the following commentary: So much for your boasted British jurisprudence!

 The lexical usage feared and forgotten by Englishmen in their country grammar schools returned to haunt them in their colonies. They laughed at them, but at times, were singularly floored by political correctness.

 Herbert Compton a Britisher who went on to write a Kiplingesque book in 1904 on the sepia-tinged life in colonial mofussils and bungalows was in for a shock when his clerk applied for leave one day. 

 Sir, the letter went, pray excuse from office this day on account of boil on left elbow as per margin. The tumour was perfectly illustrated to scale, on the side of the sheet.

 His friend, however, suffered worse.

 The sahib was out chasing wild ducks outside Calcutta, as was the custom, and peppered a native villager with snipe shot in the process. Now, you always have to have a written record of any transaction even if its an act of benevolence in 1900.

 The sahib compensated the villager with 10 rupees Compton doesnt mention whether it was wilful and ordered his clerk to obtain a receipt for the money. 

 The dutiful clerk went on to write: To compounding one bloody murder, ten rupees. Omissions excepted.

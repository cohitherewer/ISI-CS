 Murder cuff on wife

 - HELD FOR CONSPIRACY WITH ACCUSED

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The woman whose husband was murdered allegedly by her paramour and one of his friends on Kali puja night last year was arrested on Wednesday.

 Anita Mondal has been arrested on charges of conspiring with the other accused in murdering husband Biswanath, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas). 

 The other accused Gora Chand Mondal, with whom Anita reportedly had an affair, and Dinanath were arrested on Tuesday, hours after the skeletal remains of Biswanaths body were recovered from a septic tank near a resort in Joka.

 Gupta said the trio was produced in court and has been remanded in judicial custody for two weeks. The two minor sons of Anita aged nine and four years are with Biswanaths father Haradhan.

 The skeleton has been sent for forensic test and police are waiting for the report to ascertain the exact nature of injuries, said an officer of Bishnupur police station, on the southern fringes of the city.

 Police said Biswanath, 33, who ran a furniture shop in Bishnupur, had suspected his wife of having an affair with his friend Gora Chand. He had objected to the affair, but neither Gora Chand nor Anita paid heed to him. 

 On Kali puja night (October 21), Gora Chand had a drinking session with Biswanath and Dinanath.

 A quarrel broke out between Biswanath and the duo over the alleged affair, during which he was allegedly beaten to death. Gora Chand and Dinanath dragged the body to a farmyard and dumped it in the septic tank.

 The incident came to light following a complaint lodged by Biswanaths father. He was told that his son had gone to Bangalore on some urgent work. 

 But he became suspicious when he visited Biswanaths house last Friday and caught Anita and Gora Chand in a compromising position.

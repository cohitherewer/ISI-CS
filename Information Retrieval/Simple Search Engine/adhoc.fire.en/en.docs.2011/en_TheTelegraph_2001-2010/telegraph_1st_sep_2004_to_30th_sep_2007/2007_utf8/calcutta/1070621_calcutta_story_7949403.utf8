 Four government agencies have joined hands to beautify the riverside with a heritage park on Prinsep Ghat, built in 1834. 

 The forest department, public works department, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners together will develop Prinsep Ghat, which used to be a landing stage when the Hooghly flowed past it.

 This decision was taken after representatives of the four agencies held a meeting with chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb at Writers Buildings last week. 

 The Prinsep Heritage Park will be built on about five acres, which belongs to the defence. It will have an open-air museum where military equipment will be on display. Prinsep Memorial will become a part of the park.

 The park will be open to all. Military arms and ammunition, tanks and uniforms will be on display. It will be the first museum of its kind in the city, said a senior army officer, adding: The heritage park on the city riverside will be a deterrent to criminal activity on the river bank.

 Apart from the museum, the park will have an open-air, floating theatre for cultural programmes. The forest department will develop a small forest and an aviary.

 We plan to develop the park with Howrah bridge in the distance and Vidyasagar Setu spanning the horizon, said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests (urban forestry). 

 All the four agencies have already carried out a joint inspection of the site. The agencies are expected to submit their report separately by next week. The work will start on the basis of the reports.

 We are conducting a survey to earmark the places where the forest, waterfalls and the bird sanctuary will be located, Mukherjee added.

 The park will open by Durga puja 2008. A park like this on the banks of the Hooghly will serve as a lung of the city. The cost of the project will be finalised once all four agencies submit their reports, said a senior civic body officer.

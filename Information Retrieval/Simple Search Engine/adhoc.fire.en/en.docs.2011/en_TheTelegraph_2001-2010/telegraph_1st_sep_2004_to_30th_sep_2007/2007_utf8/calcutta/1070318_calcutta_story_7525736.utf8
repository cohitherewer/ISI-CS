 The problem 

 Progressive Paper Mill, an industrial unit located in the crowded residential neighbourhood of Beharilal Ghosh Road in Belgharia, is the cause of enormous air pollution. It is affecting the lives of all of us living in the vicinity for over a year, but our complaints have fallen on deaf ears. 

 The source

 The mill, an old one, used to run on gas till 2005, which did not lead to environment hazards. The situation changed when it started to operate on oil, after the gas connection was cut off, reportedly due to non-payment of dues.

 The exhaust from mills chimney is extremely polluting. It emits not only toxic fumes, but also dark, oily droplets and soot that have deposited on a radius of more than a hundred yards. The deposits are not only on our bed but also in our food. No one wears a white shirt in the area any more. 

 On deaf ears

 The unit was approached a number of times by the residents. Though we received promises of action every time, hardly anything was done.

 Complaints to agencies responsible for controlling pollution brought little respite. The senior law officer of the state pollution control boards public grievance cell heard our mass petition in September last year, referred the case to the technical department and promised to respond. We did not hear from the cell again.

 Another mass petition was sent to the chairman of the state board recently. Complaints to police and municipality had little effect. Only the local councillor tried to help us.

 We repeatedly tried to convince the authorities that the pollution from mill has become unbearable and if they do not intervene, there might be a large-scale agitation.

 We again appeal to the administration through Metro on Sunday to take up the issue with urgency and give respite to thousands of residents in the area.

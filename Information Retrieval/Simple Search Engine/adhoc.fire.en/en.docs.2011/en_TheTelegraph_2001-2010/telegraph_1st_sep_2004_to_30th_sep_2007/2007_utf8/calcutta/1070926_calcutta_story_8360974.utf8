 The deluge in Calcutta has led to widespread disruption in power supply.

 CESC has switched off supply to several pockets, as meter boxes and main switches of many houses are under water. The affected areas include Lake Town, Bangur Avenue, Dum Dum Park, Kalindi, Ultadanga, Wood Street, Park Circus, Ballygunge, Picnic Garden and Jodhpur Park.

 Several localities went without power for 18-20 hours. In some, supply was yet to be restored till Tuesday night. The residents have been facing a water crisis, as pumps could not be operated.

 Power supply to Ultadanga was switched off after water started entering the Ultadanga pumping station.

 Many people alleged that the CESC helpline, 1912, was of no help. I tried to call the helpline several times to lodge a complaint, but it was always engaged, said Bablu Saha, of Lake Town.

 CESC, however, said it had received 1.02 lakh complaints on its helpline and all were addressed.

 We have 210 lines in our 1912 service. Consumers could not get through possibly because there were too many calls. We seek suggestions from consumers on how to improve our helpline service, said Santanu Chatterjee, the executive director (corporate development), CESC.

 When will the supply be restored fully? We are clueless, said a senior official of the utility. We have been receiving frantic calls from consumers, who are asking us to switch off supply to prevent electrocution, said a CESC official.

 Death: The body of a 30-year-old woman was found floating in water near Ultadanga More on Tuesday. Police said she was possibly electrocuted while walking down the waterlogged road.

 The police initiated rescue operations across the city, deploying 12 boats of the disaster management group. Around 1,400 marooned people were rescued.

 Extortion

 A 40-year-old woman and her sister had to endure extortion in broad daylight, thanks to the deluge.

 The two were travelling down Rajarhat Road in a car, on their way to the airport on Tuesday morning.

 Problem started when they reached the base of the Rajarhat flyover. We were driving slowly, as the area was waterlogged. Suddenly, five young men stopped our car and offered to push it across the waterlogged stretch, said the woman, who works at a multiplex.

 We refused, but the youths started spraying water into the car engine and the exhaust. We could not drive, as they were standing in front of the car, recalled the woman, who did not want to be named .

 As the engine sputtered and died, the group started pushing it up the flyover. After reaching the top, the men demanded money. We were scared and gave them Rs 100, the woman said.

 But their woes were far from over, as the engine refused to rev up. The women had to pay Rs 50 to another group to push the car down the flyover.

 A few people in Maruti uniform refused to help them, as their car was an Indica. We had to call up the Indica service centre nearby to get our car towed, said one of the women.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Four tools to safer streets

 - Subhas tables proposals to check mishap count 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ttcity for killerwheels

 Citizens cry for safer streets 

 that has reached Writers Buildings through The Telegraph 

 campaign hit home on Thursday, with the state transport 

 department submitting a list of proposals to police.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty 

 convened a meeting with police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee 

 and tabled some road rules to curb the accident count.

 Metro takes a look at four 

 major suggestions and runs a reality check:

 PROPOSAL: 

 Use of speed governors on public buses and lorries to check 

 speeding.

 Logic: 

 The speed governor will regulate the speed of a vehicle 

 within the stipulated 30/40 kph. The driver cannot speed 

 even if he wants to. The use of this device is permitted 

 under the Central Motor Vehicles Act and some states have 

 implemented this to curb speeding, said a transport department 

 official.

 GROUND 

 REALITY: Kerala had experimented with this last October, 

 but a strike by private bus operators and lorry owners forced 

 a rollback. The transport lobby claimed spending Rs 15,000-20,000 

 to install a speed governor was not feasible. Given the 

 transport ministers woeful track record in getting vehicles 

 to switch to cleaner fuel, the speed governor looks a non-starter.

 PROPOSAL: 

 Around 300 volunteers be deployed at the 30 busiest 

 intersections in the city during peak hours.

 Logic: 

 Since the police are busy regulating vehicular traffic, 

 the volunteers will monitor pedestrian movement. This will 

 prevent jaywalking and make crossroads less chaotic, said 

 the official.

 GROUND 

 REALITY: Sporadic attempts have been made to manage 

 traffic through volunteers and most have ended up adding 

 to the chaos.

 PROPOSAL: 

 Policemen and motor vehicles department inspectors to monitor 

 tests for heavy vehicle licences.

 Logic: 

 The selection process for bus drivers must be more stringent, 

 said the official.

 GROUND 

 REALITY: Corrupt cops and motor vehicles officials 

 stand accused of encouraging licence loopholes. How will 

 that be stopped?

 PROPOSAL: 

 A joint commissioner of police to oversee motor training 

 schools.

 Logic: 

 The motor training schools would become accountable, said 

 the official.

 Ground 

 reality: Top cops are struggling to keep the city 

 going, how will they run training schools?

 Will these proposals work?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Passenger offloaded on graft cry

 - Trader complains of loan non-repayment

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A passenger was offloaded from a flight on Wednesday afternoon, following allegations of fraud brought against him by a businessman. Both were taken to Airport police station and interrogated till late at night.

 Avtar Singh, a cloth merchant from Tollygunge, told the police that he had given a few lakhs to Avinash Sharma on Wednesday morning. Sharma, a cloth merchant based in Delhi, was supposed to return the money in the afternoon.

 Singh said he had called Sharma several times on his cellphone, but could not speak to him. Initially, Sharma did not pick up the phone and later, switched it off, said an officer of the airport police station.

 Singh knew that Sharma was to leave for Delhi on an Air Sahara flight in the afternoon.

 Sharmas flight was scheduled to take off at 2.40pm. Singh reached the airport at 2.30pm and lodged a complaint with the domestic airport manager, alleging that the businessman from Delhi was taking away his money.

 By then, Sharma had boarded the flight. A team of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel brought Sharma down from the aircraft. The flight finally took off at 4pm.

 He was taken to the airport managers office, where his bag was searched. Airport sources said more than Rs 3 lakh was found in the bag.

 Sharma, however, claimed that the money was his and denied having taken any loan from Singh.

 The Calcutta-based businessman, on the other hand, alleged that the money found in Sharmas bag was his.

 Both businessmen were interrogated in the managers office by the police and airport officials till late in the evening. Around 8pm, they were taken to Airport police station for further questioning. We are interrogating both men thoroughly, an officer said.

 The police are trying to ascertain whether Singh had really lent money to Sharma. It seems Singh had doubts about Sharmas integrity. In that case, why did he lend him so much money? asked an officer.

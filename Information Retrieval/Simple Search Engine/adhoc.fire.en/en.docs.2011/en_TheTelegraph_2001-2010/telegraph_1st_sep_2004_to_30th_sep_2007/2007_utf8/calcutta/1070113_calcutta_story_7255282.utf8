 Deepak Bhattacharya, on Friday, was remanded in judicial custody till January 25 for allegedly killing his 14-year-old son Biswadeep at their Regent Park home on Monday.

 Deepak was arrested on Tuesday after his wife Papia lodged a complaint with Regent Park police station.

 The father of the promising table tennis player was produced in Alipore court on Friday following his release from MR Bangur Hospital, where he had been admitted when he complained of chest pain. Additional chief judicial magistrate of Alipore court P. Ghosh heard the case.

 On Monday, Deepak had allegedly hurled a hard object at his son for leaving a practice session at home midway as he was feeling unwell.

 In her complaint, Papia said Deepak had a history of punishing his son whenever he lost a match. He would even torture her and their nine-year-old daughter, Neha.

 Public prosecutor Swapan Chakraborty said: Deepak used to force Biswadeep to lick the floor if his performance was not up to his expectations. He would lash his son with electric wires and seal his lips with adhesive tape to silence him. Even on Monday, Deepak did not allow Papia to call a doctor, though Biswadeep lay writhing in pain.

 Papia, added Chakraborty, suffered silently out of fear.

 None of Deepaks family members was present during the hearing on Friday. A few neighbours from Niranjan Pally, in Regent Park, had turned up. With public resentment towards the father rising, a police contingent was posted at the court as a precautionary measure.

 Woman in trader dupe net 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The detective department arrested a woman in her mid-20s for duping a businessman of Rs 2.6 lakh by promising to arrange for him a loan of Rs 23 lakh from a finance company. 

 We received the complaint from the trader last week and arrested the woman on Tuesday, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Koyel Mukherjee, posing as the representative of a local finance company, met businessman Joydeb Mandal last year. 

 Mandal, looking for funds to expand his business, paid her a commission of Rs 2.6 lakh after she handed him a set of papers, claiming that his loan application had been sanctioned. 

 But when the promised cheque did not reach him, he went to the Park Street office of the finance company and realised that the woman had duped him. 

 When he got in touch with Koyel to return the commission money, she, along with four men, went to Mandals home and forced him to sign a written declaration that he had got his money back. 

 We have booked Mukherjee on the charges of cheating. A hunt is on to track down her male associates, who threatened Mandal, said Singh.

 When students of Calcutta Universitys Viharilal College of Home Science got their B.Sc Part II marksheets, they could not believe their eyes. 

 Koel, Ria, Tulona and some others had scored record marks as high as 98 out of 100 in the fifth paper. But Priyanka, Smita and the rest had managed only 12.

 The marks mess triggered protests and the campus was on the boil throughout Tuesday. Little did the students know that man and machine had combined to confound one and all.

 First was the examiners turn. He chose to mark the 47 students of the college out of 150, instead of 100, in the paper. Most scored well, securing more than 100.

 Then the machine did its bit. Since the full marks in the paper was 100 and the computers had been programmed accordingly, they dropped the last digit of the marks of those who scored more than 100 during tabulation. Thus, a girl who had scored 110, ended up with only 11.

 It was the high marks that alerted the university officials. They recalled the answer scripts on Tuesday evening and got them re-examined. 

 The corrected marksheets were sent to the college on Wednesday. But those who had scored in the 80s and 90s were in no mood to return their first marksheets. They protested against the second marksheet.

 I scored 92. The second marksheet shows that I have scored 60. The university officials should explain on what basis they have reduced 32 marks, asserted Tulona Chakraborty.

 Is there any guarantee that the second set of marks is correct? The corrections have been done in less than a day, pointed out Smita Karmakar, who had barely touched double figures in the first marksheet. She was not happy with her marks in the second marksheet either.

 The undergraduate council will decide what action can be taken against the examiner. The students should not suffer, stated Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of the university.

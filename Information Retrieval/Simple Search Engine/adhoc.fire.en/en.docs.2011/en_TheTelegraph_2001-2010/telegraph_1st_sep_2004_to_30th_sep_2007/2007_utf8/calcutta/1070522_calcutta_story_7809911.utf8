 An unusual, but welcome, sight greeted the residents of Kidderpore on Monday no vehicles parked in the middle of Karl Marx Sarani. Buses and trams plied on the busy thoroughfare, minus the snarls that passengers and local residents were used to.

 Metro reported on Monday that a section of policemen from Watgunge thana and local criminals had turned the road into an illegal parking lot. Vehicles could be parked right in the middle of the artery, between Five Star and Fancy markets and Babubazar, for a fee as high as Rs 100 for a couple of hours. Some were forced to shell out even more.

 Four constables, who were spotted instructing the local goons on Saturday, were absent on Monday. They were replaced by two other constables.

 The local goons who controlled the parking lot, in connivance with a few policemen, are not around. Everyone here is happy, at least for the day, said Abdul Rashid, who runs a garment shop in the locality.

 I find it hard to believe but this, indeed, has happened, said a local resident. The goons ran an extortion racket with help from the police.

 Another resident wondered how long the criminals could be kept at bay. There is every chance of them returning soon.... We hope the local police station will ensure the road is not blocked again.

 The local goons and the policemen had turned the road into a parking lot after it was widened, following concretisation of tram tracks. 

 The criminals misbehaved with those who visited the markets with their families. Those who challenged the goons were harassed and abused.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim was not available for comment.

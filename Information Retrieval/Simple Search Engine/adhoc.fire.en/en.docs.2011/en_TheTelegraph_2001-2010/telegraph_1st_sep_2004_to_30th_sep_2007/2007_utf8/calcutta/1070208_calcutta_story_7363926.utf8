The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Match update

 Tickets for the India-Sri

 Lanka derby may have all the dos and donts for the

 venue, but heres a ready reckoner to plan in advance

 for a hassle-free eight hours at the Eden Gardens. 

 Expected turnout: 80,000

 spectators. Queue up for your seat at least an hour

 before the scheduled 2.30 pm start to beat the crowds. 

 Theres no point

 in carrying water, as bottles are not allowed inside

 the amphitheatre. Water pouches will be sold at Eden.

 With security concerns giving

 sleepless nights to the Cricket Association of Bengal

 bosses, battery-operated items transistors, binoculars are

 banned from the field. Mirrors, glass items, firecrackers,

 bugles, and even conchshells are not allowed into the

 stadium.

 Transport to and from

 Eden will be smooth, as Metro services will be available

 from Dum Dum and Tollygunge stations till 11 pm.

 The last local from Sealdah for Ranaghat and Bongaon

 leaves at 11.40 and 11 pm for Budge Budge.

 Cooperate with the on-duty

 police personnel. With the top cop at the helm of affairs,

 Eden will turn into a fortress, with deployment of

 over 2,000 policemen, commandos and Rapid Action Force.

 An additional force of 1,500 will be deployed to guard

 the hotels where the teams are lodged.

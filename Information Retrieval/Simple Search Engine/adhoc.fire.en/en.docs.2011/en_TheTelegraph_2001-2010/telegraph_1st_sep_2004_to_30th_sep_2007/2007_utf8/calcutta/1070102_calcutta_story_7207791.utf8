 Many guests had made their way across miles to celebrate New Year with family. The revelry reached its peak at 12, with balloons rising into the winter air along with party poppers and confetti. There was not a toehold of space on the dance floor. Nostalgic numbers like Auld Lang Syne and When the saints go marching in were sung in chorus led by band Blue Mist. Even the waiters stopped service for a minute to bring in the year with a smile.

 Saturday Club

 Jessica, emcee for the night, started the countdown to 2007 just before the clock struck 12 and the club crowd erupted in celebrations. The members raised a toast to the birth of a New Year. They were hugging each other and wishing each other all the best for the next 365 days till they gather again to welcome the coming of another year. The mood was one of warmth and the dance floor was packed. The celebrations peaked as both hands of the clock moved towards 12 midnight, smiled Jessica.

 Space Circle

 Here, there was no real countdown to the midnight moment. After their respective solo performances, the two singers from Mumbai Roop Jouhrie of Honey Honey fame and Channel V Super Singer winner Ravindra Upadhyay started a duet with about 10 minutes to go for 2007. Exactly at 12 midnight, they stopped their song and wished the gathering a Happy New Year. As the dancing crowd began embracing friends and family amidst a shower of confetti, and some started frantically calling and SMSing those not so near, the duo continued singing, belting out hits like Wheres the party tonight.

 Nalban

 It was Punjabi power in the form of Rang De Basantis title track that took over the 40 Thieves After Dark party hosted by Shisha as the midnight hour crept close.

For half-hour of non-stop fireworks, everyone had an eye on the sky. The colour and the co-ordination enthralled the party crowd. Only after this quasi star shower did the party resume with New Year cheers, hugs, and kisses and, of course, drinks and dances.

 Rabindra Sadan

 With moments to go for midnight, a packed Rabindra Sadan was sharing the agony and ecstasy of Aditya Sanyal, the master builder of the Swapnasandhani play Moy Danav (an adaptation of Ibsens play The Master Builder) at Anya Theatres all-night year-end bash, Natyaswapnakalpa. Over the years, this offbeat way of welcoming the New Year has gained in popularity; as director Bibhas Chakraborty pointed out, This is the only way theatre lovers can celebrate through more theatre.

 At the stroke of 12, the crowd families, young couples and some senior citizens were milling outside the Rabindra Sadan auditorium for Barsho Baran Utsav. The children struggling to keep pace with Ibsen and Shaw, greeted the songs of Dohar with a cheer. Their folk songs provided a merry accompaniment to the switch from 06 to 07. Warm greetings exchanged, the crowd was back in place for Gautam Haldars Kavya Gaane, a special cocktail of theatre, music and poetry.

 I spent New Years Eve with my husband Jisshu at a friends private party. We were having fun and at midnight, we kind of missed the moment because we were attending phone calls, but that didnt last for too long. It was five minutes past 12 when we got to hug each other!

 I brought in the New Year with my fiance Raj at Shishas 40 Thieves After Dark at Nalban. It was my first New Years Eve with him and I wanted it to be really special. We were dancing at the stroke of midnight and then got lost in the beauty of the fireworks.

 I am away from the city shooting and the New Year was brought in surfing channels after a long days work. When it struck 12, I watched the live telecast of parties across the country. It felt funny catching up on the Calcutta parties on the telly instead of being part of one!

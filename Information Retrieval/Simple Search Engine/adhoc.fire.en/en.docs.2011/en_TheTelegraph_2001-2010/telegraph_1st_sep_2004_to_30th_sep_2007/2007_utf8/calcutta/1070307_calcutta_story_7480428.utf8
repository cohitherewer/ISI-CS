 A day after the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) introduced water tax, the opposition on Tuesday blocked traffic to protest the move. A social organisation, on the other hand, accused the civic body of charging money for supplying contaminated water. 

 Trinamul Congress supporters put up a blockade on Howrah bridge in the afternoon over the issue, causing a huge traffic snarl. The blockade lasted about 15 minutes, said a police officer.

 Charging tax for water supply is justified, but the water should be fit for human consumption. The water supplied by the HMC is contaminated, alleged general secretary of Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity Subhas Dutta. 

 Dutta filed a public interest litigation against the civic body in 2001 over supply of contaminated water.

 The chief engineer of the HMC had conceded in an affidavit to the court that sewage might have leaked into water supply pipes.

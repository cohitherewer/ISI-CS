The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Man with a Spidey mask

 Calcuttan Of The Week

 Name: Gobinda Mukherjee (Picture below by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)

 Occupation: Toy-seller 

 Claim to fame: A small, dhoti-clad figure carrying a light bamboo stand hung with toys, Mukherjee is a common sight in Salt Lake. The endearing old man has been peddling toys for 50 years, from street to Calcutta street, from school to school, wishing a smile to his little customers. With a Spiderman mask, or a dinky car. 

 Modus operandi: He works mostly in Salt Lake now. While the weekday mornings see him in front of Dewdrops, a nursery school near Tank No. 4, the afternoons and weekends take him as far as Karunamoyee, or along the various lanes and bylanes of Salt Lake. I was about 20, when I first started this. I had tried other things, but it didnt pay well, says Mukherjee, who lives in Maniktala. 

 Old and new: The toys in his collection have changed over the years. In the beginning I had only balloons, he says as he hands a toy mobile phone to a boy and shows him how to make it ring. There are carrom boards, guitars, a plastic tube-well with a pail as well as alphabets and numbers and doctor sets. 

 Swank shops: He doesnt feel threatened by the swank toy shops, because his ware falls into a separate bracket. The toys in my collection cost Rs 10, 20 or 30 at the most. They are simple playthings, something to put in the childs hand when he comes out of school, he laughs. Earnings are uncertain. I earn Rs 80 one day and Rs 50 on another. Holidays and vacations are difficult times. Then I have to walk much more to sell even one toy. 

 The future: One of his sons has followed in his footsteps and sells balloons. Another works in a grocery store. Mukherjee wants to go on as long as he is can. Theres always a demand. No matter how sophisticated a car or doll a child has, he is still drawn to a simple colourful drum or a whistle, he says.

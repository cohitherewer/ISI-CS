 Idle plan for idol-makers

 Even as they steady their hands, drawing the finest lines to add lustre to the goddesses eyes, the ground beneath their feet is forever shifting. The idol-makers of Kumartuli are tired. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has been dangling before them a development plan for four years. But only years of talks have followed.

 On Thursday, there was another meeting, which the Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskritik Samity (an idol-makers union) did not attend. The committee that oversees the plan does not inform us about the meetings properly, says Babu Pal, secretary of the union. 

 The union has made it clear that it will not entertain any talk of moving since the peak business period has started. Development work would mean shifting us to a different site till work at Kumartuli is completed. We cant shift till after Jagaddhatri Puja in November, says Nemai Pal, president of the union. Why do they always bring it up when we are busy? December to April is a lean period for us. 

 The CMDA plan promises repaired roads, better living quarters, studio space, exhibition or sale area, a museum and facilities for visitors. But much remains to be sorted out. The plan requires every idol-maker to give away 10 per cent of the plot he owns for development. This is not possible, says Nemai Pal. Theres a shortage of space here. If we give away space, how will we accommodate the big Durga idols? he asks. The plan also mentions separate display areas for clay and pith idols. But this may unnecessarily create a divide between us, Nemai Pal adds. 

 Finding an alternative area is difficult. Earlier there was talk of relocating the idol-makers along the Bypass, but the idol-makers opposed this, as it would be difficult for them to transport clay, bamboo and straw, the raw materials for their craft, from the banks of the river. A plan to relocate their studios in Cossipore followed. Now I hear that both our houses and studios will be shifted to Cossipore. That will be difficult, says Dilip Pal. 

 The years of uncertainty have taken their toll. Customers keep reading that we will be shifted and have started to place orders locally. Business was poor during Saraswati Puja this year, says Babu Pal. Nemai Pal estimates that the customer count has gone down by at least 20-25 per cent in the past three years. Roofs are leaking, walls are crumbling, but unless something collapses completely, we cant undertake repairs because we might have to move, says Nemai Pal. 

 Sudhanshu Sil, MP, who is on the Kumartuli development committee, stresses that development will not hamper the idol-makers work. We wont be able to give them money. So how can we hamper their business? asks Sil. We have the funds and everyone has agreed that work must start soon. But its difficult to give a date, he added.

 The idol-makers remain sceptical. Will the planned development happen? Or will we have to wait for another election for the work to start? asks Nemai Pal.

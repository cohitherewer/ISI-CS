 JEE merit list faces twin suit salvoes

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The problems facing the state Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) board are increasing with each passing day. 

 After the controversy over admission in medical colleges in the state, the board has got into a legal tangle over the method of preparing the JEE merit list. 

 On Thursday, two different courts of Calcutta High Court admitted two separate petitions, moved by some students who scored high marks in Higher Secondary but could not make it to the JEE merit list. 

 Both the petitions challenged the method adopted by the board for awarding ranks to students, who appear in the examination conducted by it.

 Both Justice Biswanath Somadder and Justice Aniruddha Basu of the court, after admitting the petitions for hearing, asked the JEE board to file affidavits stating its stand with regard to the petitioners allegation.

 The petitioner students alleged that the JEE board had adopted a faulty method to select candidates for medical and engineering courses. 

 Less meritorious students are getting a chance in medical or engineering courses, in place of deserving candidates, due to the faulty method, they claimed.

 The process of doubling the marks obtained in mathematics in case of engineering and biology in case of medical courses to work out the rank of students is not scientific and justified, claimed the petitioners. 

 Besides the common subjects, physics and chemistry, students seeking admission in engineering courses write a mathematics paper, while medical aspirants sit for a test in biology. 

 The method of excess weightage to marks scored in mathematics and biology is not right. Chemistry is very important in medical education and physics is as important as mathematics in engineering courses, pointed out a petitioner. 

 Besides the method of ranking, the petitioners also highlighted some administrative lacunae on the part of the JEE board. 

 According to the petition, the JEE Board does not have the right to conduct the examination as the post of the Board chairman is not a legally sanctioned post.

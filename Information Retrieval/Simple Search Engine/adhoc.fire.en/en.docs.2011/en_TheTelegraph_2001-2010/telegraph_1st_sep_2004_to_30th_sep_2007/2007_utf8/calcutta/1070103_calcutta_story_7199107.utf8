 Culture for a cause

 Sristi rsquo;s young members during a performance

They hail from slums, squatter settlements, streets, platforms and red-light districts, but have not let their backgrounds hinder their dreams.

 After workshops with Usha Ganguly and Debashish Bhattacharya, rehearsals with Rangakarmee and performances at Raj Bhavan, the young members of Sristi are set to take on the world.

 Sristi is the cultural wing of CINI ASHA, the urban arm of the Child In Need Institute, an NGO that works for nutrition, health and education of women, children and adolescents. Through our performances, we want to make people aware of the issues that we should take a stand against, said Gargi Ray, a core group member of Sristi.

 The group has performed plays and mimes on child labour, child abuse, trafficking, drug addiction, HIV/AIDS and child marriage in and around Calcutta for other NGOs, schools and government departments.

 Fees for the shows range from Rs 500 to Rs 1,500. The money goes into our fund for travelling expenses, costumes and other necessities, said Dipankar Chatterjee, coordinator of Sristi.

 Usha Ganguly, who conducted workshops for Sristi, selected eight of its members for her group. One of them, Rinki Mondol, has performed in a play called Mukti.

 Being a part of Sristi has given the children the hope of pursuing creative professions. I would love to do plays professionally, stated Biswajit Ghosh, another Sristi core group member.

 A unique thing about Sristis plays are that the dialogues are decided during rehearsal. The script is written later.

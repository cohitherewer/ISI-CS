The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Additions to beacon list

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

The state government wants to add a few more names to the list of dignitaries allowed to use the beacon atop their cars.

 This was conveyed to Calcutta High Court through an affidavit signed by Sumantra Chowdhury, additional chief secretary in the transport department.

 Last week, Metro had published a list of dignitaries enjoying the privilege illegally.

 The affidavit was in response to an order of the division bench of acting Chief Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice K.K. Prasad, asking the government to state what steps it had taken to curb illegal use of the beacon.

 By making a few modifications in the norms, we are going to include the names of a few dignitaries in the list, the affidavit stated. 

 The state sought the courts clearance for the change.

 Chowdhury said transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had issued a notice to police to check illegal use of the beacon and take action against the violators.

 The authorities have been directed to disclose the names of the owners and drivers of the vehicles using the beacon illegally. Around 17 persons have been caught and prosecuted by the deputy traffic commissioner for unauthorised use of the beacon, Chowdhury added.

 According to central norms, the chief secretary, home secretary, director-general of police, high court judges, advocate-general and the mayor can use the beacon.

 Advocate Idris Ali had moved a public interest litigation (PIL), claiming that police were not taking steps against those using the beacon illegally. In his petition, he cited two instances of dacoity, where the criminals fled riding cars fitted with the beacon.

 Last year, former Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly had asked police and the public vehicles department to take stern action against the illegal users of the beacon.

 The matter is expected to come up for hearing on February 23.

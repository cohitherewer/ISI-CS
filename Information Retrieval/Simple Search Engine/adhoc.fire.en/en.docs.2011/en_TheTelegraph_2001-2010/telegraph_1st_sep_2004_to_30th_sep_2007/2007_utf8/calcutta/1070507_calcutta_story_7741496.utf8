 Gangs from outside keep cops on toes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Criminals are moving in from the districts and the neighbouring states to take advantage of a vacuum in the citys underworld. And the cops are clueless about their activities, in the absence of an effective source network.

 The change in the citys criminal profile was highlighted by the arrest of 11 robbers from the districts during raids in South 24-Parganas and Howrah on Friday night. 

 The men, belonging to two gangs, had robbed two gold merchants in north Calcutta in December and January, said officers of the detective departments anti-burglary wing. The gangs were from West Midnapore and South 24-Parganas.

 The probe had hit a stonewall; the detectives had no information about the gangs behind the robberies. We received a lead only after four months and worked on it for a month, was how an officer of the detective department explained the delay in the crackdown.

 Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh said: Most of the city-based gangsters are on the run or in jail. As a result, theres a vacuum in the citys underworld, which is attracting criminals from other districts and states.

 Singh admitted that criminals from outside the city are giving the force a tough time. We do not have information about them in the database. As a result, when a group of criminals enters Calcutta and commits a crime, we find it difficult to obtain leads, he stated.

 Officers of the homicide wing have been trying for more than two years to solve a murder-and-robbery case on Lake Temple Road. 

 A gang from South 24-Parganas committed the crimes. It had raided a cellphone shop and opened fire, killing owner Reshmi Mahnot, before looting the store.

 We found out that the gang was from South 24-Parganas only after six months. Our network of sources proved useless in the case, said an officer.

 Two-and-half years ago, Rs 85 lakh was robbed from a bank in Kidderpore. 

 It is the biggest bank robbery in the recent past and was committed by criminals from Jharkhand. We could arrest the gang members after almost a year, stated another officer.

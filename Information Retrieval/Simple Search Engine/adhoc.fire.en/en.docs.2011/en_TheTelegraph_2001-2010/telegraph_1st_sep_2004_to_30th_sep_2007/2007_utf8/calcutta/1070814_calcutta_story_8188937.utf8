A committee formed by Trinamul Congress workers in Belgachhia, Howrah, is demanding between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 from local traders for holding a function on Independence Day. 

 Trinamul MLA from Gaighata Jyotipriya Mullick, former MLA of Shibpur Jatu Lahiri and the partys district president, Arup Roy, are slated to attend the programme, organised by Swadhinata Dwibas Udjapan Committee.

 The receipts are signed by the committee president, Bhaskar Bhattacharya, a Trinamul worker.

 The traders went to lodge a complaint with police against the Trinamul workers. Both Bantra police and Liluah police claimed the area did not fall within their jurisdiction.

 Arup Roy, the Trinamul district president, said: We are against forcible collection of donations. If the local party workers pressured the traders to pay, I shall not attend the function. Bhattacharya claimed: We did not force anyone to pay the amount written on the receipts.

 Ananda Mishra, the owner of the Mishra Transmission and Engineering Company, said: On August 8, Bhattacharya, along with 20 men, came to me and demanded Rs 10,000 for the function. When I told them that I could not pay such a huge amount, they said they would come back.

 Omprakash Jaiswal, the owner of Jai Matadi Trading Company, said: I told them that I could not pay so much money but they refused to listen to me. 

 Vinit Agarwal, the owner of IT Global, refused comment. One of his employees said he has been asked to cough up Rs 25,000.

 Compassionate vision

 Despite being engaged in the worlds oldest profession, prostitutes suffer from deep-rooted social stigma and are forced to live in alienation from mainstream society. Most of them are victims of exploitation, violence and crime, leading their lives with a high risk of occupational mortality. Beshya, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Pintu Paul, attempts to highlight the lives of this forsaken group in a manner that will make them acceptable to people of all ages and walks of life. Visualised from the artists perspective, the women appear in a bearing that is very different from the common perception. Reflecting their attitudes and lifestyles, this exhibition focuses on aspects of their life that stand apart from their profession. Characterised by their garish costumes and heavy jewellery, the women are nevertheless portrayed with an eye on the aesthetic. The paintings also provide insight into their chores, pastimes and private lives, as well as their natural environment.

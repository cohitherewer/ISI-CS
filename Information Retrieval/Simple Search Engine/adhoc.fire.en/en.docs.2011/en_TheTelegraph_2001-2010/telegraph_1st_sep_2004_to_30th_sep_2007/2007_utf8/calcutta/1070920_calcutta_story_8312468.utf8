 At wheel, 90% loose cannons

 Lack of policing, no strict measures against road rule 

 violators and poor road condition are the prime causes of 

 traffic chaos. 

 Around 90 per cent of bus, taxi and autorickshaw drivers 

 in Calcutta cannot control their impulse when they take 

 the wheel.

 These are findings from a joint 

 survey conducted by the pure psychology department of Calcutta 

 University and Calcutta police.

 To understand the triggers behind 

 reckless driving and adopt appropriate measures to reduce 

 the number of accidents, the study was rolled out a year-and-a-half 

 ago. 

 It is an ongoing study. We have 

 interacted with 250 offending bus, taxi and auto drivers 

 to gauge their mental state, said Nilanjana Sanyal, senior 

 teacher of Calcutta Universitys pure psychology department, 

 overseeing the research.

 Calcutta police had provided the 

 names and addresses of the drivers to the researchers. Interactive 

 sessions, group discussions and one-to-one interviews were 

 used to understand the behavioural pattern of the offenders.

 According to Sanyal, the drivers 

 come from the lowest socio-economic strata and lack education. 

 Because of their frustration, 

 physical strain, lack of education and enormous sense of 

 inadequacy, once they grasp the steering, they feel the 

 thrill of having an entire vehicle in their control. They 

 honk, overtake and race unnecessarily as such acts give 

 them a sense of relief. All these factors contribute to 

 make them road rogues, she explained.

 But the study has also made it 

 clear that drivers alone cannot be held responsible for 

 the spate of road accidents. 

 There is no doubt that administrative 

 failure has contributed to the problem, added Sanyal. 

 According to the study, draft 

 findings of which have been shared with Calcutta police, 

 the list of prime problems include a poor traffic controlling 

 system, lack of policing, lack of vigil in accident-prone 

 zones, corruption among cops, poor road conditions, slippery 

 roads in monsoon and jaywalking. 

 We are waiting for the research 

 to be complete. As far as the issue of policing is concerned, 

 we will definitely look into the suggestions, said Ranveer 

 Kumar, the joint commissioner of police (traffic).

 The complete report will take 

 another two years to be ready, but the researchers are regularly 

 sharing their findings with traffic department officials. 

 According to the researchers, 

 the most effective measures for tackling reckless driving 

 are tight policing on streets and severe punishment for 

 offending drivers. 

 We have found that the tendency 

 to drive recklessly is less when the drivers realise that 

 they will have to face tough consequences if they commit 

 the slightest offence, said Sanyal.

 In most cases, the owners of the 

 vehicle pay the price if it is impounded for reckless driving. 

 Though driving licences are cancelled after six offences, 

 getting a new licence is not at all difficult in the city. 

 Besides advocating tough measures, 

 the study has also drawn up a set of soft suggestions for 

 a safer city. 

 Motivating drivers against reckless 

 driving through workshops, group discussions and regular 

 counselling is necessary to reduce incidents of road rage. 

 But the benefits will come only in the longer run, observed 

 Sanyal.

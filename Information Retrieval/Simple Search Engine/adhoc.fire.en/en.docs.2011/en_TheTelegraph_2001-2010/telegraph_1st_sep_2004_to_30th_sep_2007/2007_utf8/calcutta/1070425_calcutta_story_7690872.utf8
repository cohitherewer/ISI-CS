 Comrades are jostling for space with school students at a Howrah address. And it is the 1,000-odd students who are losing out, with the CPM leaders forcing their way into the campus of two schools.

 The two-storeyed building at 93 Dr Abani Dutta Road hosts two schools Sri Krishna Hindi Municipal Corporation Free Primary School in the morning and Tendal Bagan Guru Nanak Vidyalaya from 11 am.

 It also serves as the office of ward 13 of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC). 

 Repeated pleas from the school authorities to shift the ward office have fallen on deaf ears. The office remains abuzz with activity through the day, with party and municipal workers dropping in, even as classes are being held in the schools. 

 We used to have five rooms for five classes. Since one room has been occupied, we are left with only four rooms. It is impossible to hold five classes in four rooms, so we have been forced to divide a room into two, Wazid Ali, head teacher of Sri Krishna Hindi Municipal Corporation Free Primary School told Metro. 

 The comrades first entered the campus before the 1999 Lok Sabha elections and took over two rooms for party work. 

 It was difficult to run the school with a party office on the campus So, we protested and asked them to leave. They vacated one room last year and made the other room a ward office, said S.N. Roy, former head teacher of the school. 

 According to Roy, he and four other teachers who had protested the setting up of a party office on the campus were transferred to other municipal schools. 

 Mamata Jaiswal, CPM councillor of ward 13, sees nothing wrong in a ward office being located on the premises of schools. 

 The school is run by the HMC and the premises is the property of the civic body. So, the HMC can open its ward office there, stated Jaiswal. 

 The majority of students and teachers do not agree with her. They fear the classrooms may be taken over. 

 With meetings being held and people visiting the ward office, it is difficult to concentrate on our lessons, said a Class IX student of Tendal Bagan Guru Nanak Vidyalaya, which has over 550 students. 

 The number of applicants is increasing at both schools, but expansion is on hold due to the space crunch, said a senior teacher of the high school. 

 The HMC officials are aware of the discontent among the students and teachers of the twin schools, but defend the existence of the ward office on the premises. 

 I have not got any complaint from the teachers. The ward office should not pose any problem to the schools. Besides, the mid-day meal programme is monitored by the ward office, said Supriya Hatua, education officer of the HMC.

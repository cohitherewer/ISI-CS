 Winter excursions, a regular on 

 the calendar of most schools and colleges across the city, 

 gain in significance whenever learning combines with fun. 

 The department of journalism and mass communication of our 

 college arranged its first educational trip to Sankarpur 

 from December 11 to 13. It aimed at acquainting students 

 with the day-to-day activities at fisheries and of the fishing 

 folk. Three faculty members escorted about 48 of us students 

 on the tour.

 We got to meet the fishermen of 

 Matsyagandha fishery. Some of us filmed the daily toil of 

 the villagers. Our interaction taught us about the compelling 

 situations that these people frequently face. They made 

 us their ambassadors to the state government to convey their 

 demands for better wages and compensation in case of accidental 

 death.

 In our leisure hours, we played 

 antakshari and enjoyed the campfire. We went to the 

 beach to watch the sunrise and trekked through a dense green 

 patch. The tour was refreshing for the entire team.

 Winner on skates

 A team of roller skaters from 

 Dew Drops Academy of Performing Arts gave a brilliant performance 

 at the opening and closing ceremonies of Sona Chandi The 

 Great TTIS Challenge last month. Now they have emerged 

 joint winners of a contest on Boogie Woogie. The 

 group was the first to perform on roller skates in the popular 

 dance talent hunt on television (picture right).

 Dew Drops performed well to the 

 tunes of Soniye, for which a lot of credit went to 

 choreography instructor Amit Shaw and trainer Ajay Bera. 

 Javed Jaffri, one of the judges, praised the youngsters 

 who have already bagged four awards in dance competitions 

 in Calcutta.

 New courses

 Birla Institute of Futuristic 

 Studies (BIFS) is offering two unique six-month courses, 

 in addition to its regular programmes on tea management, 

 hospital management, photography, public relations and advertising. 

 The first is a course on Mental Health Care which will help 

 those in managerial positions, personality trainers, grooming 

 experts, NGO and hospital staff, teachers, home-makers and 

 even students. 

 The minimum qualification for 

 admission is a graduate degree. Through role-playing sessions 

 and tests like the Anger Ladder Test and the Stress Test, 

 students will learn to handle persons with suicidal and 

 aggressive tendencies.

 The other course at BIFS is on 

 investment management, which focuses on the share market. 

 Candidates should have passed Class XII, preferably from 

 commerce or economics streams. Faculty members include stock

 awareness camp in mid-December for 70 students of the college. 

 Participants included alumni members and local people associated 

 with small-scale industries.

 Emergency drill

 Birla High School took the much-needed 

 step towards disaster management by conducting a mock fire-evacuation 

 drill with students of classes VI to XII recently. They 

 were taught not to panic, to avoid stampede, to proceed 

 systematically and to use the emergency exits.

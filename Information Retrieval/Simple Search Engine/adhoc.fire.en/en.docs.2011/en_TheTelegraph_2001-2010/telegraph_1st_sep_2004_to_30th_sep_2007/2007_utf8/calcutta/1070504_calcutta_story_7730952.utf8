 Dilli Haat-style crafts bazaar plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta will soon boast a permanent crafts and textile bazaar, on the lines of Dilli Haat, according to a recent plan being considered by the state cottage and small-scale industry. 

 A handicrafts museum, a handicrafts and handloom export hub and a new training centre, too, may soon materialise. 

 The department has decided to build a permanent marketplace for handicrafts which will have a food plaza and a crafts bazaar housing stalls from every Indian state, reflecting a multicultural variety in tastes, shapes and forms.

 Shows promoting handicrafts and handlooms will also be held all year at the exhibition hall, to be constructed within the complex .

 Weve not yet decided on the land, but were trying to identify a site in the city, suitable for the Haat, said cottage and small-scale industry minister Manab Mukherjee on Thursday. 

 Also on the anvil is a handicraft and handloom export hub, to be created on a one-acre plot at Rajarhat.

 The idea is to get all exporters in the city under one roof, where they can display their products. Were writing to the Centre to sponsor part of the Rs 2.5-crore project, said the minister.

 The department is simultaneously considering a plan for a Bengal Handicrafts Museum at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) in Salt Lake, which will showcase crafts exclusive to various districts of the state.

 An institute for training artisans is being considered as well, in Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city.

 Handicrafts from Bengal have found favour with buyers, both from outside India as well as from other Indian states, said the minister. 

 Recently, the state directorate for cottage and small-scale industries has successfully negotiated the supply of around Rs 40-crore-worth of handicrafts to Spain, he added.

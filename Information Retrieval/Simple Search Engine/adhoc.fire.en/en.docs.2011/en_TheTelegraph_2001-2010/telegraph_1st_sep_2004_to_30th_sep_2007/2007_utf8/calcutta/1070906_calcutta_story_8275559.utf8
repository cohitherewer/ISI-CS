 The process of giving Kalighats Patuapara a facelift, on the lines of Kumartuli, has started. On Monday, members of the Assemblys standing committee on information, culture, youth and sports, led by chairman Tapas Pal, visited Patuapara to check out the ground reality. 

 The situation is very grim. The houses of the artisans are dilapidated, said Pal, who is also the local MLA. 

 About 35 families of idol-makers live in Patuapara. During the festive season, they are assisted by nearly 400 workers, most of whom hail from the districts. 

 We had a meeting with the artisans and they placed certain demands before us. We have asked them to submit their demands in writing, so that we can discuss them at the standing committee meeting on September 10, said Pal. 

 The artisans want better water supply and more space for making idols. We require a lot of water to make idols. But we have to stand in long queues with the local residents to get water. It is inconvenient for everybody, said Karun Pal, an idol-maker. 

 Considering the number of idols we make every year, the space is too small. Hence, we are forced to occupy the footpaths, said Nikhil Pal, the president of Patuapara Mritshilpi Unnayan Samity. 

 The artisans also want a separate space to display pictures of their best works. Foreigners often visit the area. If we get an opportunity to display our work, we can bag more orders from abroad, he added.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority has undertaken a Rs 26-crore project for the upgrade of infrastructure at Kumartuli. Work is scheduled to begin soon.

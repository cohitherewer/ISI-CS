 Ishani and Sumit Dutta were expecting their first child on September 17. But then we decided to advance the delivery after consulting our gynaecologist. We wanted our child to be born on Janmashtami, said Sumit, a software professional residing on Southern Avenue.

 So Ishani underwent a Caesarian section and gave birth to a girl at Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre on Tuesday.

 Baby Dutta was not the only one beaten to the biological clock by Janmashtami, the birthday of Lord Krishna. Doctors in many maternity departments in leading city hospitals were overworked on Tuesday thanks to requests from parents to advance or postpone dates of planned delivery to this auspicious hour.

 The operating theatre was busy throughout the day, said an official at Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre. There were 12 Caesarian sections conducted at the Rawdon Street hospital on Tuesday, roughly double the average count on any given day.

 It was no different at Woodlands hospital where the number of Caesarian sections went up by 60 per cent on Tuesday. The number of baby births is high on other auspicious days too like Christmas, New Year, Sashthi and Akshay Tritiya, said Sumedha Sen, the CEO of Woodlands.

 Irrespective of caste and religion, more and more requests are coming in these days for a special date and time of planned delivery, revealed consultant gynaecologist Ranjit Chakraborty. It is okay as long as the requests are within the safety period, he added.

 Maturity of foetus is the key. A planned Caesarian section is safe up to three weeks before the due date, provided the weight and maturity of the foetus is all right, said consultant gynaecologist B.D. Mukherjee.

 Once safety is assured, many opt for auspicious dates, led by Janmashtami. We wanted to name our boy Krishna, so we planned the delivery for Tuesday, smiled a young couple.

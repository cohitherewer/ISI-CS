 Beds and biers

 The play revolves around the story of an impoverished middle-class joint family comprising a retired old man, his wife, their son and daughter-in law and two adolescent grand-children, a girl and a boy. The metaphor of the bed which stands for comfort, satisfaction and conjugal bliss actually serves to highlight the very absence of these things in their claustrophobic dissatisfied lives, denoting more the bier on which their wishes lie. Each person is a nuisance to others and this is highlighted by the frayed nerves they all display. The breakdown of communication is shown by the absence of any dialogue among the three generations. All grumble and whine, betraying a sense of failure they have let down life itself. The realistic space denotes the choking suffocation and unspeakable hurt caused by relationships and the characters incapacity to escape from their lives.

 Event: Play in Hindi, Charpai, produced by Nata Bundele, Bhopal When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Rabindra Sadan

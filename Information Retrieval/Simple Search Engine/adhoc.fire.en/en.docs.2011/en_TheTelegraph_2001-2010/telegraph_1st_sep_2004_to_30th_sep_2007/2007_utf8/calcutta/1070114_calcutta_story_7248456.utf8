 What: Le Souk Night Bazaar. 

 Where: Shisha.

 When: January 10, 6 pm to midnight.

 Take a look: Shisha regulars were in for a treat on Wednesday night. Eight stalls by designers offering pretty fashion picks to stylish homeware gave the bar the look and feel of a buzzing bazaar.

 An initiative by Medhavini Khaitan, Neha Bhatnagar and Vasundhara Mantri, the night bazaar was the first of its kind in a city nightclub. The name was derived from souk meaning bazaar in Arabic.

 For the adventurous male shopper, there was a line of trendy wear by Medhavini. Stripes, floral prints and splashes of bright colours defined the club and loungewear; double-layered shirts and jackets were highlighted by the torn look. 

 Dip plates shaped like question marks and commas, candle stands like button mushrooms and a range of innovative ceramicware formed the focus of Anupama Jalans collection all drawing inspiration from nature.

 Dipshikha Murarkas range of tunics and kurtis in flowing fabrics like georgettes and chiffons were a hit. The fusion pieces were embellished with sequins, lace, croquet and shellwork. 

 A lot of homemakers picked up bric-a-brac and homeware from Hugli. Decorative lights, photoframes, wooden plattersthe list was long. For bachelors, there was an amusing collection called Happily Unmarried that included shot glasses and mugs with graffiti and a bottle opener in the form of a shapely leg. 

 For the more daring, Leena Kejriwals stall offered peppy and fun snapshots along with high-quality digital art portraits.

 Simple and elegant western wear for women was best found in Aparna Kumars collection. The pieces with foil printing and hand embroidery were subtly embellished.

 Picked up enough stuff for your wardrobe? Now how about matching them with accessories by Vasundhara Mantri? Silver with semi-precious stones, cocktail neckpieces, mother-of-pearl, leather bracelets, belts with jewelled buckles, watches, cloth malasthere was no end to the glam add-ons for the party people.

 Up from Manju and Shradha Hadas stable (a mother and daughter-in-law duo) were stoles in a mix of colours with polka dots and bubble patterns. Leather edgings and crystal work added the final touch. In bags, there were smart evening clutches and day carry-ons in suede, jute and printed fabrics.

 Pocket pinch: Starting from Rs 120 for knick-knacks, the night bazaar offered fashion goodies that went up to a few thousands.

 Voiceover: Its a great concept. Calcutta needs to wake up to innovative ideas like the night bazaar. A fun ambience to shop in is what makes it so special, said a shopper, glad to be at a mart at midnight.

 The City Diary

 Khokan Mullick, 40, was arrested on Monday night for allegedly raping his two daughters. He was caught by members of a local club while trying to sneak into his house at Bardhanpara, in Birati. The club members beat him up.

 We have arrested Khokan on the basis of a complaint by wife Kamalika that he had raped their daughters, aged nine and 11, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police. The rape has been proved by medical tests.

 A mob damaged a minibus after it ran over an 11-year-old boy at Mandirbazar, on the southern fringes, on Tuesday morning. The minibus was trying to overtake another bus. The Class III student was taken to a local hospital where he died. The driver managed to flee but the conductor was caught and beaten up. The agitators put up a blockade at the Karbala crossing for nearly an hour.

 Sheikh Mannan, 35, died after falling off the 19th-floor terrace of a building in Alipore on Tuesday morning. Police said Mannan, a resident of Ranitala in Murshidabad, was taken to hospital where he was declared dead. The body was sent for post-mortem.

 Internet and telephone services disrupted after the fire at Telephone Bhavan on Tuesday were restored on Wednesday, claimed a Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) spokesperson. 

 According to him, repair of the feeder cables damaged in the fire and restoration of one of the main power units began late on Tuesday and was completed on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The fire was an act of sabotage and a private player could have had a hand in it, said a section of the BSNL employees on Wednesday. They demanded a CBI probe into the blaze.

 The chief general manager of BSNL, Samar Kumar Chakravarty, denied the possibility of sabotage and said that a four-member committee has been set up to investigate the cause of the fire. We need to find out the reason behind the fire so that we can take precautionary measures, he said.

 Services were restored in phases since late at night and work was completed at 1.30pm. Telephone and Internet services to important buildings like Raj Bhavan, Writers Buildings and Lalbazar police headquarters were restored before others, said the BSNL official.

 Writers Buildings officials said that the telephone lines to the chief minister, chief secretary and the finance ministers rooms were restored by 7.30pm on Tuesday. The other lines became operational on Wednesday morning. However, there were minor disruptions throughout the day.

 The deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Gyanwant Singh, said the lines at the police headquarters were restored before noon.

 The disruption was because of the shut down of all processes after the fire as a preventive measure to avoid damage to the core equipment. Even the leased lines for landline connections and networking had to be disconnected, affecting a large part of the city, explained the spokesperson.

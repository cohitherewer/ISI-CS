The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flier wants food, fisticuffs follow

 - Passenger denied meal on non-stop flight held on airport touchdown

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A scuffle for food at 30,000 ft landed a Dubai-based Bangladeshi national in the custody of Calcutta airport police station on Tuesday morning.

 The 50-year-old passenger was, however, released after a day-long grilling as the charge against him creating a problem on board for being hungry was not found to be serious enough.

 The man, who was coming to Calcutta to meet his relatives, had boarded a non-stop flight of Emirates that took off from Dubai at 2am.

 He told the police that he was very hungry as he had not eaten anything since leaving home at 9pm. Half an hour after the flight was air-borne, he demanded that a meal be served to him immediately. But the crew refused, saying it was not yet time for food.

 But the hungry passenger was in no mood to be lectured about flight norms. He told the crew that since he had paid quite a sum for the ticket, he had the right to be served food on demand, said an airport official.

 As an altercation ensued, the man allegedly tried to hit a crew member who asked him to behave himself. With the situation at a height of 30,000 ft spinning out of control, the crew informed the pilot, who briefed Dubai airport about the problem.

 The passenger was given food and Dubai promptly passed on the message to the air traffic control of Calcutta airport, said an Emirates official.

 The Central Industrial Security Force was put on alert and soon after the flight touched down in Calcutta, securitymen escorted the passenger out to the terminal. 

 He was taken straight to the police station, where a crew member lodged a complaint against him.

 The police, however, did not slap charges against the man and released him in the evening. He created a problem as he was hungry. The charge was not serious, said an officer.

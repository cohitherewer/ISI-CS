 Probe into Besu death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A four-member panel, constituted by the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) authorities, will look into the circumstances that led to third-year MCA student Abhijit Nandis death on Monday. 

 The committee will also investigate vandalism at the university hospital by a section of students following the death.

 The third-year MCA students boycotted classes on Tuesday, demanding immediate renovation of the hospital. They said Abhijit would not have died if the hospital had even the basic infrastructure.

 Janardan Sutradhar, a third-year MCA student, said: As soon as Abhijit fell to the ground and started gasping because of chest pain, we asked the hospital authorities to send an ambulance. They informed us that there was no ambulance in the hospital. We took Abhijit there on a scooter. We waited for more than 10 minutes as the doctor struggled to open the oxygen cylinder.

 Janardan added: There was no fresh syringe to administer an injection. They finally used an old syringe. According to him, if Abhijit had been put on oxygen instantly, he would not have died.

 Dilip Dhali, another student, alleged that the only ambulance of the hospital was rented out to outsiders by a section of hospital employees.

 The committee will try to find out if there was any lapse by the hospital in treating the student, the damage caused by the vandalism and the students involved in it.

 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjea, the vice-chancellor of Besu, said: Abhijits guardians never told us that he had a cardiac problem. If they had, we would not have taken the risk of allowing him to stay in the hostel. The committee will look into all aspects of the incident so that such a tragedy does not recur.

 Youths suffer burns

 - Transformer explodes on Camac Street

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two young employees of a roadside food stall suffered burns when a CESC transformer exploded on Camac Street on Friday afternoon. 

 Subhash Baidya and Ratan Dutta, both in their mid-20s, were washing utensils on the pavement below the transformer, opposite CMC House at 28 Camac Street, when it exploded.

 Subhashs uncle Montu Sarkar, the owner of the food stall, said: We were done for the day and were getting ready to pack up and leave when we heard a very loud sound. The next moment, I saw a huge ball of fire falling from the top of the transformer. My nephew and an employee were washing utensils below. The ball of fire landed on my nephews back, burning him severely. The employee also suffered burns in several places.

 The injured were rushed to SSKM Hospital by police and pedestrians. Subhashs condition is critical, said doctors.

 Pedestrians scampered for cover and the area around the transformer was deserted within a few minutes of the blast.

 The transformer explosion revived memories of the blast at McDonalds on August 12 morning, which killed one person and injured four people. 

 What happened at Big Mac was unheard of and unseen on Park Street. So, we were really scared when we heard the sound of the blast today, said an employee of a furniture shop, on the opposite footpath of the transformer.

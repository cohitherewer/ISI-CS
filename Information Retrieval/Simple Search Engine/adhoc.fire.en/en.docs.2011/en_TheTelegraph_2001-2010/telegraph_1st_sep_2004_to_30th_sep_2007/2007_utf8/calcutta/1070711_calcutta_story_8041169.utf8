 For those diehards who cant get their day started without the customary nine holes in the morning, last weeks deluge sank a double-bogey damper.

 Golf, that quintessential colonial passion of Calcutta, came to a grinding halt as both the civilian 18-hole courses in the city failed to tee off, forced into an unprecedented weeklong sabbatical by the elements.

 For the first time in the clubs modern history, the course was shut down for a week as soggy greens and fairways and overflowing drainage canals made it unplayable, confirmed M.M. Singh, CEO of Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC).

 The club welcomed golfers back on course on Tuesday morning after the management carried out repairs on a war footing on Sunday and Monday. For the course to be shipshape, however, Singh and his staff are praying for two uninterrupted days of sunshine.

 The long layoff has dampened the spirits of RCGC regulars, more so since so much work went into making the course playable round the year. Even during the 78 floods, the course was shut down for only three days, recalled Ashit Luthra, a past captain of the club. But the intensity and volume of rainfall for four consecutive days threw all our pre-monsoon preparatory work out of kilter.

 Across the road, at Tollygunge Club, another haven for city golfers, the story was much the same, with the game buried in the water hazards for close to a week. We had to suspend play to avoid serious damage to the course even as we continuously pumped water out of the flooded fairways, said Arunava Chakravarty, the deputy managing member of the club. 

 For four days, the club couldnt mow the greens and put tractors on the course. We have two large tanks on the southern and northern flanks, which can absorb an enormous quantity of water and act as safety valves. But this downpour was a different kettle and even Tollys Nullah started to backflow into the clubs drainage system, Chakravarty rued. Tolly resumed action on Sunday, but for the course to be daisy-fresh, it will take another two-three days.

 The sprawling, 170-acre campus of RCGC also has 30-odd waterbodies, big and small. But all of them overflowed, as water from the adjoining areas started flowing in. This could be a fallout of the sudden spurt in highrise construction around the club, Luthra points out.

 For the clubs, no golf also translated into slack F amp;B business in the mornings. Yes, a lot of our members would have a hearty breakfast and down some beers after a rigorous round. We hope itll be business as usual from this week again, says Singh, of RCGC.

 Thieves are entering households posing as civic employees sent to spray pesticides. A Telegraph picture 

 A youth claiming to be a civic employee sent to spray anti-mosquito chemicals stole a cellphone and a watch from a Prince Anwar Shah Road house on Thursday morning.

 A similar incident was reported from the same police station area in April. No one has been arrested in either case.

 The youth, in his mid-20s, arrived at the two-storeyed house of Srikanta Mukherjee (name changed) on Prince Anwar Shah Road at 11.40am. He was carrying a consent form for mosquito treatment, which he claimed was issued by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 Mukherjees daughter signed the form and left the house. The polite young man proceeded to check the interiors of the house, sprinkling a liquid in all the rooms. After he left, I realised that my cellphone and watch were missing, said Mukherjee.

 In the earlier incident, a youth aged around 25 had turned up at the Jheel Road home of Amalendu Sengupta, 62.

 The youth, carrying a leaflet on precautions against the spread of malaria and other diseases, identified himself as a civic employee.

 He entered the house to inspect the bathroom, which he claimed he would fumigate later. He looked at a bucket full of water and asked me to fetch some cleaning material. In the five minutes he was alone, he lifted my mobile phone and took out Rs 700 from my wallet lying on the table in the front room. I noticed the theft after he left, recalled Sengupta.

 No one has been arrested. Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), said: Efforts are on to trace the culprits and recover the stolen items.

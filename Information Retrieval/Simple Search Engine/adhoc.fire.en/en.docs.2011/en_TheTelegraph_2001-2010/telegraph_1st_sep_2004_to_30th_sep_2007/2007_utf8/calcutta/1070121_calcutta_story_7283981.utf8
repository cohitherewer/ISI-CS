The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A festival of flaws

 Moments from Several Witty Observations and (below) Golapjan

 Indias showpiece international theatre festival, initiated by the National School of Drama (NSD) and now in its ninth avatar, deserves critical scrutiny owing to its high visibility and use of the taxpayers money. 

 At the inauguration, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took pride in the fact that this satellite edition had brought the cultural capital into its orbit for the first time, but it became questionable how much basic culture his minions know, when his lamp refused to stay lit symbolic of the fests future because nobody checked that the wick had soaked up too much oil.

 Next, consider the organisation, rather lack of it. The prestigious foreign shows begin at 6 pm, which assumes that (a) Calcuttans dont work beyond 5; or (b) they can bunk office at will; or (c) theatre is meant for retired seniors and children (who, under age 10, are not allowed anyway). No wonder audiences were thin. 

 And the venues? That cavernous chamber of horrors, Rabindra Sadan, and the apology for an auditorium, Sisir Mancha, suited more for seminars and music than theatre. Certainly not the best halls in town, but requisitioned because the government gave them virtually free, ordering the Paschim Banga Natya Akademi to take over. Several visiting crewmen complained about the uncooperative staff.

 The distribution of passes followed the time-honoured Indian bureaucratic standard. Sure, anyone could buy tickets, but if you came late, the counters were shut. Already, the best seats in the house had been blocked off and handed as freebies to the aunts, uncles, friends and fawners of those in power or politically correct for the Akademi.

 I have no problem with this procedure as long as the invitees arrive. But most never utilised their passes, leaving huge pockets of absence in the auditoria. Performers want to see humans, not holes, in the first 10 rows; it demoralises them to face yawning gaps in front, not to speak of the yawns on the mouths of those philistines who do sit there.

 Lets turn to the programming: what a strange selection process! Of course, the NSD had little say in the international entries offered by foreign cultural centres, but it did choose the domestic companies. Why, for instance, did Maya Raos Khol Do get the nod? A very old production, it has come to town before, at Nandikars National Theatre Festival, 1997. Likewise in age with the late SM Solaimans Golapjan for Theatre Art Unit, Dhaka, which the Akademi itself brought down just two months ago for its own festival. These two slots could have gone to newer plays/troupes from the bonanza in Delhi that Calcutta had not viewed.

 In this disaster/mismanagement scenario, art did manage to raise her head. Dance theatre was the central motif, and the contingents from Germany, Poland and Switzerland gave fine samples of postmodern European choreography. Sasha Waltzs noBody excellently treated the spiritual in a materialistic world, bodies to evoke the disembodied. Truly international, with 25 members from all over the world, it displayed superlative synchronised mass imagery. Often the entire group moved like a shoal of fish. A mechanistic soundscape with crowd voices suited the urban context.

 The Polish director Leszek Bzdyl had a tough time opening his performance in the cramped antitheatrical space outside Sisir Mancha, but once inside, brought considerable humour into his Several Witty Observations on Gombrowiczs writings of the grotesque, even wrestling holds as dance movements.

 From the Indian perspective, the work of a national legend graced the festival. Rukmini Devi Arundale (1904-86), inventor of Bharatanatyam, also re-choreographed several traditional Kuravanji dance-dramas, one of which, Kannappar Kuravanji, was revived by her Kalakshetra from Chennai.

 Outstanding among the theatrical presentations was Panthoibi Natya Mandirs Hanglai, from Imphal. Its probably director Y. Rajendras best work so far, marred only by his tendency to prolong. He takes his expertise in rural Manipuri clown theatre, applies it to puppetry, and tells the story of a marionette troupe ordered to change its traditional material for contemporary relevance, which will get it lots of dollars on a foreign tour. So the entire company, which behaves like puppets very skillfully and with fantastic makeup, creates a rehearsal of army puppets killing men puppets and raping women puppets, but the rehearsal goes awry because the puppets decide to change the script and do something about the problem. Multiple levels of manipulation came into play.

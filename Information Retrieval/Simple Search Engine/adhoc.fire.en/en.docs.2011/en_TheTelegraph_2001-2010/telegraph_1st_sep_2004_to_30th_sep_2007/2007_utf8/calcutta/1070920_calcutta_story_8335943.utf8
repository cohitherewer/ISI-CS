The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dapper duo with glitter in their eyes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They saunter in, they sample, they steal.

 In Bollyspeak, they would be Babli aur Babli, targeting top jewellery shops in town to leave a depleted display counter and a perplexed police force in their wake.

 Mumtaz and Nasima, two women in their mid-30s who are wanted by the police in four other states, have set their sights on the citys glitter shops in the run-up to the Puja.

 Over three days, late last month, the duo struck at three prime outlets Tanishq and Sawansukha in the Park Street area and Anjali Jewellers in Sovabazar.

 Mumtaz and Nasima, in fact, stole jewellery worth Rs 3 lakh from Tanishq and Sawansukha within a span of three hours on the same day.

 Records available with the Lalbazar police headquarters revealed that the two women had robbed jewellery worth Rs 30 lakh from outlets in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai before touching down in Calcutta.

 Police departments in all the cities are on the lookout for the two shoplifters.

 Mumtaz and Nasima were caught in the act on a closed-circuit camera at Tanishq.

 They walked in, sat down at one of the counters and asked to be shown some diamond ornaments. The video footage clearly shows one of them picking up a diamond-studded bangle and slipping it into her handbag, while her partner in crime kept the salesperson busy, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Two days before robbing Tanishq and Sawansukha, Mumtaz and Nasima had conducted a similar operation at the Sovabazar outlet of Anjali Jewellers, where they had stolen gold hand pieces.

 Kumar warned all jewellery shops to be on the lookout for two women spending time looking at ornaments without buying anything.

 With Puja shopping poised to peak and a busy festive season ahead, leading jewellery shops are already beefing up security measures.

 Earlier, we were careful, but now we will be extra cautious. On earlier occasions, there have been shoplifters who have been caught, but these two women managed to give us the slip, said Anargha Chowdhury, the co-proprietor of Anjali Jewellers.

 We have asked our salespeople to be more vigilant and also keep an eye on the closed-circuit monitor. In the run-up to the Puja, we will add plainclothed security personnel at all our outlets, said Chowdhury.

 After visiting all three jewellery shops and checking with their sales executives and security guards, the police concluded that the duo would arrive in a chauffeur-driven car.

 They were described as well-dressed and plump, posing as well-heeled clients out to buy jewellery worth over Rs 10 lakh.

 No one was suspicious because they came in a big car, conversed in fluent English and displayed a keen knowledge of latest jewellery trends, said an officer of the detective department.

 Sleuths realised that the three outlets had been robbed by the same duo when their description provided by Anjali Jewellers and Sawansukha employees matched with the the Tanishq closed-circuit camera clips.

 Then, our counterparts from four other cities sent us photographs of Mumtaz and Nasima, added deputy commissioner Kumar.

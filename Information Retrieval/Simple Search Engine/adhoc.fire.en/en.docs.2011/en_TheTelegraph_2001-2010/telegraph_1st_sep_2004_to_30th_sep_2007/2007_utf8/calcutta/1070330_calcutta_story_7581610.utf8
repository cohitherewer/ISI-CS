 Teacher harassed for loan

 JULIUS GOMES

 He had to run from pillar to post for his own money. But no one heard his appeal, leaving him with no option but to move the West Bengal Human Rights Commission against the malpractice of a government official.

 Aloke Bandhu Trivedy, an assistant teacher in Calcutta Madarsah, had been struggling since 2004 for a loan from his provident fund account to treat his cancer-stricken wife and a daughter who needs periodic blood transfusion.

 Trivedy alleged that joint director in the school education department Mir Mohammed Mohsin had played a role in delaying the sanction of the loan by withholding his service book.

 Mohsin had a grouse against me, as I had raised my voice against some irregularities in the department, Trivedy said.

 The loan was cleared in 2005, after the teacher approached Debaditya Chakrabarty, then school education secretary, who was sympathetic to my problems. He moved the rights panel following the sanction.

 Denying the charges, Mohsin said: I have records to prove that Trivedy had taken his service book from the department long ago... The matter was probed by the director.

 Director of school education D. Mukherjee said: The teachers allegations are baseless. The joint director was not involved in the case. We have submitted our report to the human rights commission and are awaiting its decision.

 A commission official said: In a case like this, an inquiry is conducted either by our officials or officials in the department concerned... We will take a decision after examining the directors report, but it will take some time.

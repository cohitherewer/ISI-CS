 - Choice of regulator

 The state government is set to tone down the proposed act to monitor private schools, in the face of resistance from the institutions. 

 The school authorities will be allowed to choose a body church, trust, examination board, council or even the state government that students, teachers and parents can approach with their grievances. The schools will have to declare to the government the body it wants to be answerable to. 

 Private schools need not necessarily be answerable to the government but they will have to be accountable to someone. There has to be a body to ensure that the schools are following the rules properly, said Partha De, the state school education minister.

 The initial draft of the bill provided the government with the power to interfere with the internal administration of private schools if there were complaints of irregularities from students, parents or teachers. 

 Several private English-medium schools have made it clear to the government that since they do not avail of any state assistance, they were not bound to supply any internal document to the government. Apprehending difficulties in implementing the act and legal resistance from the schools, the government decided to recast the act.

 The legislation will be the first of its kind in the country. We want to examine the pros and cons of the provisions. We dont mind a delay in tabling the bill in the Assembly. But it should be acceptable to the schools, students, parents and teachers, said De. Currently, only Delhi has an act to monitor private schools.

 A draft of the bill has been sent to the Centre for its nod.

 There are hundreds of private English-medium schools that offer education up to Class VII and are not affiliated to an examination board like ICSE, CBSE or Madhyamik. For these institutions, the act will provide guidelines stating which bodies are eligible to monitor their functioning. 

 Many guardians and teachers of private English-medium schools under the ICSE and CBSE curricula not Anglo-Indian or run by the Christian missionaries had lodged complaints with the government alleging that the institutions were offering poor facilities and low quality of education in exchange of high tuition fees. 

 There were also complaints of arbitrary fee hike, lack of transparency in admissions and salary structures for teachers and unfair retrenchment of teachers. The allegations prompted the state government to announce plans for the legislation.

 The school authorities want the government to inform them about the provisions of the act well in advance.

 We are already answerable to the ICSE council for our academic activities. We will welcome any government move for the betterment of our institutions. But we will not accept any provision that we did not know about before the act is passed in the Assembly, said Nabarun De, the principal of Central Modern School in Baranagar and the general secretary of the Bengal chapter of the Association of Heads of ICSE Schools.

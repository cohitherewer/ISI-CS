 Rare surgery to give birth

 SUBHRO SAHA 

 Anuradha Mitra, a young woman suffering from heavy bleeding (menorrhagia) and severe abdominal pain since early 2005, was almost close to losing her uterus. But thanks to city doctors, who removed the tumours from her uterus, Mitra is now a proud mother of a bonny baby boy.

 The incidence of uterine fibroids, which is now found in one out of four women, is on the rise in the city. 

 Mitras abdomen had become distended like a football and scans showed up multiple myomas/fibroids (benign tumours) in her uterus when the frail and anaemic 33-year-old woman was brought to Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre, recounted city-based gynaecologist Ranjit Chakraborti. 

 Her condition warranted the removal of the entire uterus. But keeping in mind her age, together with the couples desire to have their own child, we tried preserving the uterus, said Chakraborti.

 After a complicated and prolonged operation, called myomectomy, 24 myomas of various sizes were extracted from her uterus, which were completely distorting the uterine cavity. 

 Myomectomy is the surgical removal of fibroids from the uterus. It allows the uterus to be left in place and preserves the fertility of the woman for future pregnancy, said Chakraborti.

 Two years on, Mitra underwent a Caesarean section last month performed by Chakraborti to deliver a healthy child.

 Although consent for removal of the uterus was taken, we did our best. And two years later, it has been a rewarding experience to deliver the newborn. We had virtually given up on her chances of conceiving naturally, recalled Chakraborti. 

 Since fibroids can grow back, patients are suggested to conceive as soon after myomectomy, as is safely possible. Doctors recommend that couples wait for four to six months to allow the uterus to heal before pregnancy. 

 Fibroids located in the cavity of the uterus may increase the chance of a miscarriage or may cause the patient to go into pre-term labour.

 Fibroids may also increase the chance of the baby coming out head first, adding to the risk of the probability of C-section surgeries. 

 Most women start planning a family when they are well into their 30s. This increases the chances of developing multiple myomas manifold, added Chakraborti.

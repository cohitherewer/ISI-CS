 Sabya in need-to-know nine

 When Sabyasachi Mukherjee bagged the opportunity to showcase at the Olympus Fashion Week in New York in mid-2006, little did he gauge the heights he would scale with the big-ticket show.

 For a start, even before the October show, the Calcutta boy had been rated one of the two upcoming talents to watch out for on the Big Apple ramp by style.com, the portal of Vogue. The show had won Sabya a host of accolades, while the front-rowers had appreciated the maturity of the Indian collection.

 The most recent feather in Sabyas cap also follows from the Olympus Fashion Week, one among the big-four fashion weeks. 

 The January 2007 edition of Elle, New York, has rated Sabyasachi Mukherjee among one of the nine emerging labels you need to know. 

 This is very flattering what more could I say, smiles Sabya.

 I am also very excited since I am the only name from Asia in the list, he is quick to add.

 Dubbing the label eclectic, the magazine highlights Sabyas speciality as artfully detailed jackets, embellished skirts, and blouson tops, all infused with subtle Indian references.

 The other labels on the list of nine are Paula Thomas, Adam+Eve, Alice Ritter, Brian Reyes, Rag amp; Bone, Alexander Wang, Jeremy Liang and Jose Ramon Reyes.

 The safety of the 30,000 people who visit New Market every day hinges on a signboard which the civic body hung after 250 stall-owners refused to shift for reconstruction of unsafe parts of the structure.

 The executive engineer of the Borough VI building department on Thursday requested the New Market superintendent to put up a notice stating that the structure is dangerous and that the civic body has no responsibility if the unsafe parts collapse resulting in injury to inmates or the public in general.

 The stall-owners who have refused to move are from the fish, meat and vegetable range, which is unsafe.

 Law officials in the CMC feel the notice can backfire since the civic body cannot shirk responsibility towards public safety by just putting up a notice.

 The civic body should barricade the unsafe portions, asserted former deputy chief law officer of the CMC Shaktibrata Ghosh. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay last week approved the demolition of the unsafe portions after getting a structural report from the director general (building) Gora Chand Mondol. 

 Joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam, also in charge of public-private-partnership schemes, said: Reconstruction of New Market is essential on safety grounds. The 250 stall-owners will be rehabilitated after the reconstruction and they will not have to pay anything. If they do not cooperate, what can the CMC do?

 No plot is available in the market for temporary rehabilitation of the stall-owners, added Islam.

 The reconstruction will cost about Rs 10 crore. It will be undertaken as a joint venture with a private builder.

 The secretary of the New Market Shopkeepers Welfare Association, Pradip Chakraborty, said the CMC should discuss the project with stall-owners and announce temporary and permanent rehabilitation packages.

 We are not against temporary rehabilitation. But if there isnt a suitable plot, should we allow New Market to collapse? The traders are civic licence-holders. Why should we discuss the reconstruction project with them? wondered mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

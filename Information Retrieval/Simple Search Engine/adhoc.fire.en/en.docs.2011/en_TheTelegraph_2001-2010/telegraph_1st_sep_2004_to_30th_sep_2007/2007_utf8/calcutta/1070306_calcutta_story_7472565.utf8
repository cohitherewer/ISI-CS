 A delegation from the healthcare sector in the UK is in town to explore collaborations with private hospitals in specialised areas, including genetics and nano-technology.

 The seven-member team from the British Healthcare Mission has come prepared with a list of hospitals for talks on possible tie-ups.

 Demand for private medical care in Calcutta is growing. To meet the demand, private hospitals here are keen to purchase state-of-the-art medical equipment and organise world-class training for their staff, said Kevin McCole, deputy head of mission, British deputy high commission.

 He was speaking at a seminar on Exploring Healthcare Opportunities for Partnership on Monday.

 Apart from partnership, the UK healthcare industry is interested in knowledge-sharing with the city-based hospitals and also providing them medical equipment, expertise in genetics and other technology-based services.

 We have a list of hospitals in Calcutta with whom talks will be held on setting up genetics healthcare service, said Rob Elles, member of the delegation. Training in clinical genetics and counselling, transfer of technology, telemedicine and quality management are some of the areas where the British team is eyeing tie-ups with the local hospitals.

 Elles, head of National Genetics Reference Laboratory (Manchester), feels genetics services in India is yet to develop fully.

 Woodlands Hospital has expressed interest in partnership in genetics services. Healthcare based on genetics and nano-technology is still in its nascent stage here. We are looking for technical support from UK firms, said Sumedha Sen, CEO of Woodlands.

 Parminder Sunda, sector manager, Asia (healthcare), UK Trade and Investment, said several corporate hospitals have applied for opening units in that country. Among them are Apollo, Escorts and Fortis, he said.

 The two-day visit by the delegation ends on Tuesday.

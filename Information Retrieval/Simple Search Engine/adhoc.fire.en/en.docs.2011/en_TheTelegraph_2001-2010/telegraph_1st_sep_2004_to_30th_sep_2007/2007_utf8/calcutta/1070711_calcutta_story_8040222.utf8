 Kathak creations

 Featuring dances choreographed by Chetna Jalan, Padatik Dance Centre presents Celebration 2007, based on the diverse nuances of Kathak. Swa Chhanda, an exploration of laya and chhanda, allows the dancer to innovate within the context of its basic rhythms. In The Sufi Experience, the essence of Sufism is made to blend with Kathak, the whirling movements of the dancers representing the thought behind four Sufi songs, whose music has been remixed specially for this item. Rhythm Scape, with music by Bickram Ghosh, is a duet presentation fusing Kathak with contemporary sensibility. Based on the fusion between Flamenco and Kathak, Oscar Lopez is a passionate rendition that attempts to bring out common elements between Indian and Western dance techniques. Based on Shakti Chattopadhyays poems, the final piece, comprising two items, depicts the modern urban milieu through powerful audio-visuals, acrobatics and rope-work. Hosted by EZCC.

 Event: Choreographic presentations based on Kathak When: Today at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

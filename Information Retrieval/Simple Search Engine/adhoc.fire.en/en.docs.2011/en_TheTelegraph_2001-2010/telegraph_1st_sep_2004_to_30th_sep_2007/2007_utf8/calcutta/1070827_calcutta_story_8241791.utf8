 From faith to cynicism

 Recognised as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of modern cinema, Ingmar Bergmans films depict bleakness and despair as well as comedy and hope in his explorations of the human condition. Bergman Evenings with Samik Bandyopadhyay is a unique initiative by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts, featuring 11 of the legendary directors varied works. During each screening, Bandyopadhyay will share his readings and impressions on Bergman, besides introducing each film with his commentaries. The shows will conclude with open discussions participated by its audience. To be screened this evening as part of the ongoing retrospective is Winter Light (1962; a scene from the film appears right). Cited as a favourite by Bergman himself among his films, it is sometimes considered the second in his Trilogy of Faith, the first being Through a Glass Darkly and the third The Silence. The film follows Tomas Ericsson, pastor of a small rural Swedish church, as he questions the existence of God, his faith gradually replaced by doubt, apathy, anger and hatred.

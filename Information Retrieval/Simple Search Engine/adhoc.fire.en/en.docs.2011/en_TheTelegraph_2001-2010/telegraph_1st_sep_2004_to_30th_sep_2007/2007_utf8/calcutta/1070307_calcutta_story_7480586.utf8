 Maid sets herself ablaze

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fifteen-year-old Jasoda Roy, who worked as a maidservant, reportedly committed suicide by setting herself ablaze at her employers flat in Sinthee, in north Calcutta, on Tuesday afternoon.

 The employers, Kishore Pal and his wife, were out on work.

 The Pals neighbours on Kalicharan Ghosh Road noticed smoke billowing out of the second-storey flat around 12.20 pm. They immediately raised an alarm and broke open the main door of the flat. 

 Jasoda, alias Tuktuki, was found lying unconscious, with the body charred. She was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

 It was a case of suicide. Jasoda sustained more than 90 per cent burns, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 An officer of Sinthee police station said Jasoda was last seen around 10.30 am. We are interrogating Kishore Pal and his wife. Jasodas family members have been informed about the incident. 

 The neighbours havent reported any untoward incident. Nor is there any clue of foul play, Chatterjee added.

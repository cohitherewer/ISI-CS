 Vignettes of a bygone era

 Vijay Tendulkar is synonymous with alternative theatre. The entire social fabric comes under his discerning lens and he attacks scathingly all the flaws he detects in society. Theatrons latest play, Mitrapuran is based on Tendulkars work of the same name. The play transports us to the early part of the last century. This was a time when homosexual desire, in our country and elsewhere, was still marked by the absence of a language that would express it. It was in this void that individual identities were lost and their stories buried for ever. Using flashback, the entire event is related by Bapu, a brooding, middle-aged cynical Sutradhar. He tells the story of Sumitra Dev, a girl he knew in his youth when he studied in a college several decades ago. In those days, Bapu was a gawky student from a small town. However, this didnt deter rich, hep girl Sumitra aka Mitra to befriend him. Soon, Bapu and Mitra became best pals, sharing their highs and lows over cups of roadside tea-stalls. Mitra was loud and too much like a man for anyones comfort. But trouble started when Mitra fell in love with another girl in her class. Bapu takes us through the following years, now etched in his memory years that led to Mitras death amid poverty and ignominy. Direction: Trina Nileena Banerjee

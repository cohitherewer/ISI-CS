 Scientific training for golfers

 When Viraj Madappa gives the golf ball a whack on the driving range after school, the V1 software breaks up his swing into 90 freeze frames for the coaches to analyse and iron out flaws in his action.

 Nine-year-old Viraj is among those honing their skills at the Tolly-ONGC Golf Centre, the only structured golf academy in eastern India imparting scientific coaching to golfers ranging from juniors, ladies, senior members and also top-level pros.

 The academy aims at making the golfers better players rather than only big hitters of the golf ball through professional inputs and sophisticated computer-aided golf software and hardware, says A.K. Chowdhuri, the ex-managing member (golf) of Tollygunge Club and the director of the centre.

 Housed on the Tollygunge Club premises, the centre promises to help youngsters develop the ability to make intelligent decisions on the course and could well be the cradle nurturing the future Arjun Atwals, the coaches believe.

 This is the only academy other than DLF Gurgaon to use the V1 software, which allows us to assess all the angles and the position of the head. We also have a special fitting cart by TaylorMade, which can customise playing gear, declares chief coach Indrajit Bhalotia.

 While Viraj has broken into the national top-five bracket, Aman Singhal, another nine-year-old to have emerged from the centres talent-spotting scheme, is almost there. These are all talented kids and part of the Indian Golf Unions under-18 programme. However, what has perhaps been more satisfying is working with the underprivileged caddy boys, says Abhishek Ghosh, another coach in the academy.

 Enriched by the training and the exposure, the likes of Tutul Ali and Tinku Haldar, former ball boys, have broken into the national top 10 in their age group, while another caddy boy, Samaresh Sardar, is now a top-20 amateur on the circuit.

 Corporate sponsorship takes care of the needy trainees. But it doesnt take more than Rs 450 per month to tee off with four lessons, says Bhalotia. Corporate houses are also making use of the academy.

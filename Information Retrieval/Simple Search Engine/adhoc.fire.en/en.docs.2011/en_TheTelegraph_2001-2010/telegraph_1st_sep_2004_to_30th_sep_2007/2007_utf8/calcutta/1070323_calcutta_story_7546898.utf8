 Omnibus plan for market renovation

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 No more separate joint ventures with private parties for revamping civic markets in the city. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has taken up an omnibus market redevelopment project, under which the civic body will tie up with one private party for redevelopment of all its markets and build new ones.

 Sources said a company capable of pumping in Rs 100 crore or more will be roped in.

 The omnibus proposal, raised by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, was endorsed by the mayoral council last week.

 The CMC will not take up renovation schemes, in association with private parties, for individual markets, as it has done for the College Street, Lake, Park Circus and Lansdowne markets, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Under the scheme, the authorities will hand over all the remaining 19 civic markets to one company for redevelopment. The private party will redevelop and manage the markets in joint venture with the CMC, he added.

 Relocation of the stall-owners during reconstruction and their rehabilitation post-revamp will be the partners responsibility. The partner will also build more civic markets, especially in Behala, Ranikuthi and Picnic Garden.

 There are more than 225 markets in Calcutta, of which 23 are owned by the civic body. Most of the markets, particularly those that came up after Independence, are in a deplorable state.

 The Gariahat market is a classic case of neglect wreaking havoc with a civic market, pointed out an official in the market department.

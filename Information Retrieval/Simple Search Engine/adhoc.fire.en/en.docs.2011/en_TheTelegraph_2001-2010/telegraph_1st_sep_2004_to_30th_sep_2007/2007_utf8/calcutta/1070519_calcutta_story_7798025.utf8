 BATTERY CRY: Bobita Mondal. Picture by Amit Datta

 A nine-year-old maid engaged by a Madhyamgram household has accused her employers of torturing her.

 Bobita Mondal, who was engaged by Goutam and Piyali Ghosh to look after their son, fled the house on Sunday. 

 Her mother Manjari lodged a police complaint against the couple on Friday afternoon.

 Bobita alleged that Piyali used to beat her on the slightest pretext. They never gave me enough food, so I used to eat biscuits kept in the kitchen. Mami (Piyali) beat me up after she came to know of this, she said.

 Piyali, according Bobitas complaint, often dragged her to the bathroom and forced her to stand under the shower for minutes.

 Piyali denied the charges.I had taken a photograph of the girl and used to threaten her that I would hand it over to police if she did not behave properly. But I never tortured her. I lodged a missing diary on Sunday, she said.

 Recalling how she fled, Bobita said: On Sunday morning, I found the main door open and slipped out. A person took me to Ghola police station, from where I was sent to Baranagar thana before being handed over to my mother.

 Liquor laws and business basics 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Friends corner 

 According to Feng 

Shui, liquor is best 

stored in the north-western part of the 

house. This area is connected with 

friends and hence is 

best utilised for entertaining 

Q: I would be glad if you could answer the following queries: 

 Where should liquor be kept in the house?

 I have a beam in the living room that divides the dining from the sitting area. Does it need any corrective measures? 

 In which direction should wind chimes be hung? Should these be hung inside or outside the house?

 The north-eastern sector is missing in my flat. Please suggest a remedy. 

 Is it okay to have kitchens in the north-eastern area?

 Is it fine to have 11 fish in the aquarium that contains eight gold fish, two black gold fish and one sucker that helps to clean the water?

 THE SOLUTION: Liquor is best stored in the north-western part of the house. This area in particular is connected with friends and hence best utilised for entertaining friends. 

 Beams do not have any negative effect unless somebody is directly sitting or sleeping under them. In fact, you can place a low height runner underneath this beam and decorate it by displaying an attractive lamp and some artefacts. This will not only beautify this area, but will also help lift the energy. 

 Wind chimes are best hung in the north to activate career, in the west to activate childrens luck and in the north-west to stimulate luck flowing from mentors. These are always hung inside the house to stimulate the in-flowing energy, but in rare cases they are hung outside, when used as corrective measures to help slow down the fast-moving energy that hits the house directly. 

 The best way to rectify the missing north-eastern corner is by installing a large mirror on the interior wall. This helps to create an illusion of space, depth and extension. Secondly, place an image or picture or painting of god on the eastern wall of the north-eastern corner and worship it by lighting a diya amidst flower petals floating in fresh water. 

 Normally, kitchens are not supposed to be built in the north-eastern sector of the house because prayer rooms are best located there to tap the spiritual energy. 

 But if you have no other option for relocating the kitchen, then the best solution would be to place a water sink and a fire stove in their respective areas. 

 North and north-east can be taken as the water area and east of south-east corner for the cooking stove. 

 Chinese believe that having eight gold and one black gold fish is good for enhancing wealth luck. The number of fish should always add up to nine or its multiples. Number nine is believed to attract luck from heaven to earth.

 Q: I started my web-based business in July 2006. I want to know how the year 2007 will be for my business. What steps should I take to enhance growth in my career and wealth? My date of birth is June 30, 1979.

 THE SOLUTION: Your pillars of destiny calculated from your date of birth reveal that you are a strong earth person. You will be entering into yin fire period from February 18, which will make you work a little harder for the next four years. 

 After that, from 2011 you will find a complete change in your lifestyle. This is the period when there will be a rise in your status, recognition and make you financially more comfortable.

 Presently, all you need to do is to surround yourself with shades of blue and green in your immediate environment. These colours could be introduced in the upholstery and stationery. Place your clients data and documents of the work that you have done for them in the north-western part of your office to increase your networking. Remember to face north while working.

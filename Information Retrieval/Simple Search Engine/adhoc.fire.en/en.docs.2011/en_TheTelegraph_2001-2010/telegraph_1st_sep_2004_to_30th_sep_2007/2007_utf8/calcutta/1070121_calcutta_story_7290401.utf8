 A need to connect

 On her way to Nandan for the premiere of Suman Ghoshs Padakkhep where she plays a young and ambitious IT professional, it was hard to miss the twinkle in her eyes as NANDITA DAS (picture by Aranya Sen) spoke about her third tryst with Bengali films and the various threads that bind her life.

 How did Padakkhep come about and what is your role in the film?

 The film is primarily about an old man with values different from his daughter. I play Soumitradas (Soumitra Chatterjee) daughter Megha, a working girl who represents the younger generation. There is always this double burden for working women and although she has affection for her father and means well she is taken wrongly because of her irritable nature. Circumstances are polarised and she ends up being hurtful in being too frank. 

 I agreed to do the film because I have a huge soft corner for old people and could relate to the subject. Also, Ive always wanted to work with Soumitrada, so he was indeed my biggest bait for this film.

 What was it like working with him?

 Ive had a lot of friends among the older generation who have been friend, philosopher and guide to me. Theres been Mrinalda (Mrinal Sen), Tapanda (Tapan Sinha) and Samirda (Samir Mukerjee) and now I have a fourth friend Soumitrada to add to my list. He had so many interesting stories to share about life and his younger days that it was an absolute delight to work with him.

 Its been a while since we last saw you on the Bollywood big screen

 Ive been working on a couple of regional projects. I dont see language as the main criterion and if good projects come my way I dont differentiate between films as Hindi, Tamil or Bengali. I recently did a Marathi film Maati Maay directed by Chitra Palekar and it was a wonderful story about a woman gravedigger, rarely found, and how society oppresses and ostracises her. The film has released in Mumbai, Pune and done the rounds of various international film festivals. I also did a Telegu film for K.N.T. Sastri called Kamli. 

 I did a bilingual film in English and Malayalam called Kerala (working title) for Santosh Sivan, which should release soon. The film has Rahul Bose and two English actors from the US. Ive also done a Hindi film for Manmohan Mahapatra called Bits and Pieces starring Rahul Bose and Diya Mirza, where I play a woman forcibly pushed into a mental asylum. Then theres Jagmohan Mundhras Provoked in which I play a social activist.

 And, of course, Im working on a script of my own which I plan to direct in the near future.

 Any more Tolly or Bolly projects?

 I do get a lot of Tolly film offers but either the dates clash or I dont find the script interesting enough. Talks are on, so let us see if something works out because Im always keen on working in Bengali films. I also met Deepa Mehta at the Toronto film festival recently where we had a word about a future project in English...Im happy that Water has been shortlisted for the Oscars. 

 You are a regular visitor to Pakistan...

 Ive been working with certain NGOs and the focus has been on women, children and communal harmony. I do keep travelling to Pakistan often and was there a month ago with Muzaffar Ali for a musical evening where I recited Sufi poet Rumis poems. I will be in Lahore for an annual meeting in March as part of South Asians for Human Rights. That apart, I will be doing a Pakistani film for Mehreen Jabbar, whom I met at the Kara Film Festival where Bawandar was screened. Its going to be a grilling month-long shoot in February in the deserts of Sind but I think it is a great way to collaborate and send a message of togetherness.

 How would you define yourself?

 The only label that I can identify with is that of a communicator, whether its doing an audio book on Gandhi, some social work or acting on stage or screen. They may seem fragmented but are all a part of the same aspiration. I feel strongly about various issues that concern many of us and feel the need to be vocal. There is a need to connect with people.

 When do we see you back in Calcutta?

 Im in Calcutta after six months and theres always a high comfort level in being in this city. I have a four-day break in February when my father (Jatin Das) has a painting exhibition at CIMA Gallery. Id love to be here for it but dont know if Ill be able to make it since I might have to attend a premiere of Provoked in London at that time.

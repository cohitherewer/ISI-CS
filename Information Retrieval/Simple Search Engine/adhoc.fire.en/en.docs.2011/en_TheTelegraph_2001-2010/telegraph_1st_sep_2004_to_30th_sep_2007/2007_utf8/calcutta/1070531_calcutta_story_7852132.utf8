 A bank of women and for women though men will not be driven away. 

 Standard Chartered Bank on Wednesday launched an all-woman branch in Jodhpur Park, billed as the first of its kind in India. The branch will have an all-woman staff (13 officials, including branch manager Anasuya Ramana), all-woman security and, hopefully, attract a lot of women customers. But men need not feel left out the bank has said it will continue to cater to both male and female customers.

 The city has seen two other all-woman ventures a petrol pump in Alipore and a post office on Linton Street, near Park Circus.

 Standard Chartered admits that it has opened the all-woman branch because it pays to be gender-friendly. One-third of our client base in India comprises women, said Jaydeep Gupta, head, shared distribution, India, Standard Chartered Bank, who spoke enthusiastically about inclusion banking practices that make room for women customers, their likes, dislikes and special needs.

 Jodhpur Park was chosen because the area is a strong indicator of the coming of age of women.... It is a catchment area, said Rajashree Nambiar, head, branch banking, India. This branch has a huge number of women customers.

 So, whats on offer? A fully-loaded but no-minimum balance savings account will be available only to Jodhpur Park branch customers, said Nambiar. 

 Seminars and workshops will be held regularly for women customers, with advice on financial planning.

 The branch, in fact, has been launched as a pilot project to figure out the specific needs of women. The percentage of women in our client base is growing hugely. Our research suggests that women customers prefer privacy and a non-inhibiting environment, said Nambiar. Women talking to women will ensure that, the bank feels.

 Do women need special help? Are they bad at financial planning? That is a stereotype, said Nambiar. But traditionally, women have stayed away from financial planning, which may put them off number-crunching, she conceded.

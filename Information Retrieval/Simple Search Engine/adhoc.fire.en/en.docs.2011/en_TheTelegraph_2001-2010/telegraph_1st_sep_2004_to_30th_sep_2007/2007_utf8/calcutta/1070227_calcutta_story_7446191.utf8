 The much-delayed Prince Anwar Shah Road connector, to be commissioned on March 1, is set to be widened from two lanes to six.

 The road will serve as a vital link between south Calcutta and the Salt Lake technology hub and the airport. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) built the 3.5-km path at a cost of nearly Rs 5.6 crore.

 The connector has two lanes now. But it will be widened to six lanes. The sanction for the project has been obtained. We hope to announce the date of commencement of work on the day of the commissioning, said chief executive officer of the CMDA P.R. Baviskar.

 Construction of the connector began in 1996. The work was halted several times due to various reasons. Land acquisition proved a problem, as a number of residents had to be shifted. A shrine along the proposed route also served as an impediment. There was also resistance from local toughs over supply of construction material. 

 The connector is a long-standing demand of people living in areas like Thakurpukur and Joka. They wont have to travel as far to reach the airport or Salt Lake. At present, they have to cross the Gariahat intersection which takes a lot of time to reach the north-eastern part of the city, Baviskar pointed out.

 The CMDA has completed the tender process for extension of the service road near Milon Mela, off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. The project is estimated to cost about Rs 4 crore. Work is likely to start next month.

 The CMDA will provide men, machinery and funds for the project, said general secretary of Development Employees Joint Action Committee P.B. Nag. The service road will prove essential as thousands will visit the site in future.

 The service road will extend from Park Circus connector rotary to Bridge No. 4, said chief engineer (traffic and transport) of the agency Debdas Bhattacharya. Conduits will have to be constructed near the old leather complex as part of the project. 

 A footpath will be built along the service road. We will try to ensure that visitors at the fairground dont face any problem. Later, the service road will ease traffic congestion on the stretch, added Bhattacharya.

 Verses, lyrics and melodies

 Seagull Books presents the release of Purabi: The East in its Feminine Gender; Rabindranath Tagore, a special boxed set of 52 thematically arranged poems and songs by Tagore. Seventeen poems from Purabi (1925) form the core of this volume of translations, translated by Charu C. Chowdhuri, edited and introduced by Krishna Bose and Sugato Bose. To be released by Shuvaprasanna, it will be followed by an evening of Tagore songs by Pramita Mallick and Baikal choral group. Besides being defined as the East in its feminine gender, as the Poet has put it, Purabi also signifies the name of an evening ragini whose wistful strain seems to echo Tagores own mood during this very remarkable phase of his poetic life. The book reveals a passionate Tagore, a poet who celebrates the wonders of this world instead of merely pondering the mysteries of the world beyond. It acquaints us with a tender, sensitive soul, whose irrepressible love of life was tinged with an acute awareness of its inexorable limits and tragedies. An audio CD of 16 poems and songs accompanies the volume. The songs have been rendered by Rabindrasangeet exponent Pramita Mallick. Recitations by Sugata Bose (English) and Krishna Bose (Bengali).

 Event: Release of a book of poems and songs by Tagore When: Today at 7 pm Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

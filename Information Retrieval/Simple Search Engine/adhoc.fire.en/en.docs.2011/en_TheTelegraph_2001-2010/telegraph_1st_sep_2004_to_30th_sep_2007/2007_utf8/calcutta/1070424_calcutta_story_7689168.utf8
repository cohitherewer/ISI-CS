 It was a day of fun and frolic for 150 mentally-challenged children at the Institute of Child Health on April 17, as they jumped inside the bouncing castle and demolished tin-can pyramids with a well-aimed throw of a rubber ball. They rolled about in the ball pool and played board games. The children even braved the summer heat to board the rides installed within the institutes premises.

 Children from 10 city schools for mentally-challenged children, including Reach, Noble Mission and Nishana, participated in the carnival organised by Ladies Circles 3 and 46. We will make this an annual event so that these children can have their day of fun every year, said Aparna Mohta, chairperson, Ladies Circle 46. We want to organise the next edition of the carnival in winter, added Mohta.

 The kids excitement received another boost with the arrival of television anchor-person Mir . It was nice spending time with these children. Each one of us must do something to help individuals and organisations working with challenged children, he remarked.

 Mir has planned a special shoot at the Institute of Child Health: We will shoot an episode of my comedy game show here to commemorate Childrens Day. It will feature the children here and will be telecast at a later date. 

 Tapashi Mitra, psychologist and in-charge of the institutes Nibedita Centre for Challenged Children confirmed that talks were on with Mir regarding the shoot. Interaction with people is one of the best treatments for mentally-challenged children and those with motor development problems, she explained.

 This summer, find the writer within you. An online creative writing forum, www.writeherewritenow.co.in, is organising its first creative writing course for schoolchildren. The forum, launched on February 10, offers courses in writing short stories, scripts, poetry and creative non-fiction. The duration of each course is 10 days, with online lectures on plot and characterisation, followed by written exercises that participants have to submit. The annual membership fee is Rs 500.

 Megha Malhotra, who has designed and maintains the website www.seagullindia.com, said: Participants can write, read others work and discuss their favourite books. She is one of the two organisers of the forum.

 The forum will also organise four contests over a year, the first of which is Stories for Peace, which will be held in partnership with the Peaceworks initiative of the Seagull Foundation for the Arts. Selected entries will be published in Seagulls anthology, Stories for Peace. The short story writing course continues from April 20 to 30. The website should be helpful for people interested in pursuing creative writing as a career, said Malhotra.

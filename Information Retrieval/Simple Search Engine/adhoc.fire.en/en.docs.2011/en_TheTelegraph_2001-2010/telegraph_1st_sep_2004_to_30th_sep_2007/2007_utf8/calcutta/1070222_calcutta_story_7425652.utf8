 Youth fest Yuva, organised by Unish Kuri, rocked Swabhumi from February 12 to 14. With the prelims being held from February 8 to 10, the finals of a series of fun events were lined up on the fest days.

 Skitz-o-Mania on Day One saw students donning the greasepaint for some impromptu stagecraft. The topics ranged from cookery classes and ragging to facing an interview panel. The girls from Womens College, Calcutta, walked away with the first prize. Partha Pratim Biswas of North City College regaled audiences in Laughmaster with his take on the planned Puja wardrobe of a certain Tollywood actress and her daughters.

 The big fat Indian wedding captured and held attention in Style Check, which showcased bridal wear from different regions of India. Frankfinn Institute topped the fashion event. New Alipore College stood out with its casual wear to suit the summer mood.

 Shake It, the group fusion dance event on Day Two, saw students grooving to numbers ranging from Dil na diya, Rabba rabba to Yahaan harkadam from Fanaa. JU bagged the second place with a fusion number choreographed by economics student Omkar Dattagupta. The item, based on the darker side of life, was set to numbers like Michael Jacksons Thriller. With the dancers dressed as tantrik worshippers invoking ghosts from hell, they drew kudos from rival participants like Alif, a third-year student of Kolkata Film and Television Institute.

 Live acts rocked all the way, with Ishan and Lakkhichhara playing on Day One, Fossils and Prachir on Day Two, and Kaya, Nachiketa and Prithibi on Day Three. Said Debkanya Dhar, first-year student of travel and tourism management at George College and a member of Prithibi Friends Forum: Since it is the last day of the fest and it being Valentines Day, I hope to enjoy myself to the hilt. The Prithibi concert saw the band performing signatures like Pagal. Abhirup Rakshit, a student of BBA, was a member of Kreeation, which won the third prize in the band event, titled Strike, with its original composition Mrityukal. Said Abhirup: Prithibis music suits us. Our music is similar, with a bent towards alternative rock.

 Off Beat saw Inam Hussain Mullick of JU playing a self-composition followed by a blues improvisation on the harmonica to win the event. JU (Arts) was declared champion, with Womens College and North City College coming runners-up.

 Exam tips

 A team from Horlicks

 school-goers deal with the age-old problem of exam

 phobia. Titled Exam ka Bhoot Bhagao, the countrywide campaign saw the team counsel students of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Salt Lake, DPS Megacity and Mahadevi Birla Girls High School on February 2 and 3.

 The sessions aimed at enabling the children to study more efficiently for exams and dealt with techniques to sharpen memory, to avoid distraction, to improve concentration and the correct way of absorbing information from textbooks. It also stressed on the importance of a proper diet, exercise and plenty of sleep during exam time.

 The Diary

 Alzheimers Curse

 Please exculpate my memory,

 it

 barely knows its past.

 Forsake

 me in my attic,

 your

 presence makes me aghast.

 Its not your fault,

 neither mine,

 I rarely recall who you are,

 My

 brain stops working now and then,

 my

 existence is in a cold war.

 You

 could have been my beloved,

 or

 my son, I havent

 any clue,

 A

 cryptic curse has kissed my senses,

 But,

 who am I to you?

 Archan Bhattacharya,

 1st yr BA. LlB, CU

 Counterfeit times

 I remember

 a world beautiful

 I

 remember a world divine 

 Forfeit

 a decade, the beautys been

 stolen

 Counterfeit

 joy a malediction

 on life; 

 it

 begs salvation!

 Forfeit

 a decade; darkness beckons,

 the

 dawn wont break the

 shadows 

 No!

 not this time...

 Tell

 me there is good, 

 tell

 me pigeons still roam

 the skies...

 Lost

 is the manuscript

 of right 

 in

 a world of fragile

 peace, 

 It

 ends here... 

 All

 I see now are counterfeit

 times...

 3rd yr B.Com (hon), St Xaviers College

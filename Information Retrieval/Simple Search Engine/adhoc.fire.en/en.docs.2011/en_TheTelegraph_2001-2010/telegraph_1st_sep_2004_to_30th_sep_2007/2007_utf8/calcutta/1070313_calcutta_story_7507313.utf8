 Life term for jailed gangster

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Extortionist Jishu Jain and five accomplices were sentenced to life imprisonment by Alipore court on Monday for killing a promoter four years ago. Jain had masterminded the killing from behind the bars, according to police.

 Jain had plotted the murder of promoter Mahesh Agarwal in Alipore Central jail in 2004. His conviction is a major achievement, since prison inmates have not been found guilty in the recent past, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 The detectives arrested nine persons in connection with the case. Three of the accused were acquitted because of insufficient evidence.

 Around 3.15 pm on April 7, 2004, three of Jains associates identified as Tapas Das, Shankar Das and Gautam Ghosh stormed into Agarwals office at Sahapur Colony, in New Alipore, and fired at him from point-blank range before speeding away in a taxi.

 Jain has been in jail since 2003, after being arrested on the charge of trying to murder one of his rivals.

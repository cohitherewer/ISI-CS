 Rabindra Sarobar (Dhakuria Lake), the second largest open space in the city after the Maidan, is set to don a look designed after three categories of Tagore songs Prem, Prakriti and Puja.

 This is the gist of a makeover plan for the 192-acre waterbody and its surrounding greens, prepared by a team from Jadavpur University (JU) on a request from the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), custodian of the Lake.

 As the waterbody is known as Rabindra Sarobar, we have dedicated the upgrade theme to Tagore. The entire area will be divided into three zones, to be named after three categories of his songs Prem (love), Prakriti (nature) and Puja (worship or devotion), said Parthapratim Biswas, a teacher in JUs construction engineering department and chairman of the team that has prepared the plan.

 The most active territory in the Lakes as proposed by the university will be Prem. Everyone from morning-walkers to young couples will be allowed free entry into this zone, which will be the biggest of the three.

 Then comes Prakriti, where visitors will be charged a fee. The authorities want to restrict footfall in this zone for better upkeep of the waterbody and the greens.

 The zone will have special gardens, educational enclosures for children and open-air courts where cultural programmes can be held.

 The third and the most restricted area will be Puja. This is going to be a complete silence zone, said Biswas. In keeping with the spirit of Puja, the university has requested the railway authorities to declare the stretch of the tracks along the Lake a no-horn zone.

 Officers of the CIT will soon meet the JU team to discuss the modalities of implementation of the plan, submitted last Friday. The university was asked last year to draw up the plan, after the government initiated a move to upgrade Rabindra Sarobar.

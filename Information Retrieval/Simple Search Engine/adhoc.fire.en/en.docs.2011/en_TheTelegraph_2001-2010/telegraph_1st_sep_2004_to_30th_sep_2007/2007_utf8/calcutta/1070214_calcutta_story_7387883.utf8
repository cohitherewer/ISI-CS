 He came to India as a tourist 30 years ago, much to the surprise of friends back home. Returning to the country as Prime Minister of Italy, Romano Prodi can feel the winds of change blowing in the right direction, not least in Calcutta, a unique city capable of connecting at multiple points.

 Perception was always the key problem and with a sea-change in that, tourist as well as business traffic will automatically improve, Prodi told Metro on Tuesday. The change in Calcuttas business climate has been felt and spread among the Italian business community, and despite political debate in some quarters over Communist rule in Bengal, theres keen interest to explore opportunities.

 Proof of this interest is the first wide-ranging delegation. We didnt arrive first, but we arrived in many (representatives from 240 companies and associations, 14 from the banking sector), and the result is deeper and wider than we thought, Prodi observed, shortly before winding up his discovery of Calcutta and leaving for Mumbai.

 A few businessmen might have some reservations on a personal level because of a difference in political opinion, but their attitude towards the market potential (of Bengal) is the key, the Prime Minister stressed. With this attitude now quite positive, his regime promises a concerted effort to ensure long-term commitments.

 Of course, there are two critical roadblocks direct flights and visas. While our government is simplifying procedures to fast-track visas, which should boost tourist and business traffic, a direct flight out of Calcutta could still take a while, since we are in the process of privatising Alitalia, said Prodi. A direct flight connection from Calcutta hinges on the new owners of Alitalia, but the government, on its part, is doing everything to clear the decks.

 Representatives of the small but very skilled companies accompanying the Prime Minister cut across well-targeted sectors like agro business, leather and textiles, shoes, mechanical instruments, car parts, wood-carving, infrastructure and tourism.

 The next step will be focused delegations to Bengal. Small and medium enterprise will be the priority area, but the big guns could come in as well, if the terms and partners are right. After all, the Tatas are setting up a huge small-car plant in Bengal, he smiled.

 Culture is the other proposed point of connect. We have a great past together in the cultural field which can ignite the future, he hoped, also hinting at trips by top Italian football clubs in the wake of the AC Milan colts last year.

 Calling for the need to reinforce ties in education, arts and culture, Prodi promised sharing of technical expertise in restoration architecture. Calcutta has so many buildings to preserve, and we would surely like to chip in with knowhow....

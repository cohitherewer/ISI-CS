The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Billboard bane of bridge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Environment activists and commuters are protesting the way billboards have taken over Howrah bridge.

 Two gigantic billboards of a private mobile phone company loom overhead as welcome boards to the city, on the either end of the bridge. 

 The official reminders put up by the Calcutta Port Trust, however, remain forgotten. Millions passing under the bridge almost miss out the message painted on it: Rabindra Setu is a pride of our heritage/ Its beautification is our duty. 

 Have you seen billboards on key landmarks anywhere across the world? asked Subhas Dutta, environment activist. A peeved Dutta has shot off letters to the chairman of the port trust, asking him to pull down the billboards. The port authorities are in charge of the bridges maintenance.

 The police commissioner of Calcutta and the mayors of the corporations of Calcutta and Howrah, too, have been informed about the visual pollution, said Dutta. 

 The bridge is a part of the citys heritage. The billboards definitely shouldnt be allowed, said city mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.

 We have banned billboards across BBD Bag, a part of the citys heritage zone. If required, well see that the billboards on Howrah bridge, particularly those on the city end, are removed, said the mayor.

 Gopal Mukherjee, mayor of Howrah Municipal Corporation, has also decided to take up the matter after thorough inspection. 

 Commuters are disconcerted at the way the main pillars at both ends of the bridge have been covered with billboards.

 I dont see why billboards are being allowed on the bridge, said Kasturi Chatterjee, a senior bank officer who commutes to her workplace on Strand Road from her Howrah home.

 Port trust officials were unavailable for comment.

 The City Diary

 Five 

 days after the devastating blaze at Telephone Bhavan, a fire 

 broke out inside Behala Telephone Exchange on Sunday afternoon. 

 Police said the fire broke out inside the power plant on the 

 ground floor of the two-storeyed building. Three fire tenders 

 took over half an hour to control the blaze. According to 

 S.K. Chakraborty, the chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones, 

 the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. Telephone 

 services were not hit by the blaze. 

 Trinamul 

 Congress MLA Javed Khan on Sunday announced a compensation 

 of Rs 1 lakh to the family of Mohammad Imtiaz, who died after 

 a portion of the second-floor wall of a dilapidated building 

 collapsed on him on Madan Mohan Burman Street on Wednesday. 

 The crumbling building near Burrabazar was owned by Khan and 

 his brother Pervez. 

 A 

 30-year-old man was found hacked to death near his home in 

 the Ghola police station area, on the northern fringes of 

 the city, on Sunday morning. Police said Biswanath Naskar, 

 the victim, was a graduate but had to take up the job of a 

 night guard. The body bore multiple stab wounds. His hands 

 and legs were bound and a piece of cloth had been rammed into 

 his mouth. The body was sent for post-mortem and an investigation 

 has been launched. 

 Police 

 produced Ashok Ram, 40, and Sandip Chakraborty, 35, in the 

 court of the chief judicial magistrate, Howrah, on Sunday. 

 They were remanded in police custody for five days. The two 

 were arrested on Saturday from Chandraloke Hotel, off Howrah 

 station, and a Narugopal idol, valued at Rs 2 lakh, recovered 

 from them. 

 Three 

 persons were arrested for setting three school buses on fire 

 in Chetla last Sunday. According to police, the trio, local 

 rowdies, set the buses on fire after an altercation with the 

 caretaker of a garage for refusing to pay them money. 

 Traffic 

 on CIT Road was thrown out of gear for more than four hours 

 on Sunday evening by the Rathayatra mela near Moulali.

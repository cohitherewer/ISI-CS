The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ladies mall hits hurdle

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Coming up: South Citys mall on Prince Anwar Shah Road, Mani Square on the Bypass, Diamond City North and Europa up north, Axis and Terminus in Rajarhat

 At a time when the city and its fringes are in the grip of mall-eria, a proposed Rs 50-crore retail rendezvous in Calcuttas capital entertainment corridor, Park Street, has been shelved due to doubts about sustainability.

 Avani Galleria at 91A/1, Park Street, diagonally opposite St Xaviers College, being promoted as the citys first exclusive ladies mall, will now become an office block instead. The 100,000-sq-ft theme mall was scheduled to open its doors last winter.

 Yes, we have decided to convert the property into a commercial building, since we dont feel such a small-format retail mall would be viable, said Anirudh Daga, managing director of Avani Group, developing the property.

 Inadequate size, the lack of a footfall driver like a multiplex or a high-profile food anchor, besides exorbitant rentals have been singled out as the red signals halting the retail stop. Also, the proximity to an educational campus would have made a liquor licence difficult to obtain.

 Due to the high land cost, the loaded average rental was working out to a steep Rs 150 per sq ft. The sky-high rentals were clearly a deterrent to retailers taking up space on the upper levels of the G+7 mall.

 The format was flawed, and without a footfall energiser like a cineplex or a big-ticket food anchor like McDonalds or Pizza Hut, it was always going to be difficult. Besides, a retailer must get a good deal for the rental, said Abhijit Das, regional director of property consultants Trammell Crow Meghraj.

 Architect J.P. Agrawal, designing Avani Galleria, concurred the 100,000-sq-ft format was not a suitable retail mall. Also, the price differential between retail and commercial space in Calcutta has narrowed considerably now, and retail is not as attractive as it was before, said Agrawal, who also designed Forum.

 There are serious retail lessons to be learnt from the Park Street U-turn. You cant expect a retail address to survive on shopping alone. Allied entertainment (food and movies) plays a critical role, said Madhusudan Binani, franchisee of Benetton and Adidas outlets in Forum. In the absence of any definite USP, Avani Galleria could have followed in the flawed footsteps of Vaibhav Shopping Plaza, on Lee Road, warned Binani.

 And a womens mall was never such a good idea in the first place. Even in Bangalore, Eva, a dedicated womens mall, isnt doing well. Women contribute far less to the branded retail segment than men and the concept is flawed, said Vijay Dugar, Levis and Reebok franchisee.

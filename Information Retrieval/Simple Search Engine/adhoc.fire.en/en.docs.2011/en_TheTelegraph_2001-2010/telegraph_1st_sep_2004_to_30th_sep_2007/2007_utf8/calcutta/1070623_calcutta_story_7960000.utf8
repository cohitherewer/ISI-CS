It was not easy for Krishna Gupta and her fellow teachers to cultivate an interest in studies in children for whom making ends meet was more urgent than coming to class. But for Pathchala (picture below by Bishwarup Dutta), this has been the trajectory since 1997 when the NGO was begun under the initiative of Indrani Ganguly with $100 a month donated by a friend of her son. Pathchala is one of several NGOs in the Kalighat area that are trying to give a better life to children living in the slums nearby. 

 The NGO was set up by a group of teachers who used to aid Mother Teresa. When we saw these children whiling away time that should have been spent on studying, we requested Mother Teresa to start a school for them. She was unable to, but she asked us to take the initiative, and our journey began, said Gupta, one of the founding members and a teacher at Nava Nalanda School. 

 Having started with 19 children, the organisation provides educational facilities to over 60 children today. Many used to beg at the Kalighat temple. Most of their mothers are household helps, while fathers spend hard-earned money in nursing alcohol addictions. 

The NGO would initially recruit the children by visiting the slums themselves. Earlier, none of the children would come for classes on puja days at Kalighat temple. They would go off to beg, recalled Gupta. We have to keep going on regular inspections to their homes and even schools to ensure that the children dont stop attending classes, informed Lakshmi Saha, one of the teachers. 

 Younger children are put through the paces at the Greek Orthodox Church on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road, while older children attend classes in a two-roomed flat in nearby Nakuleshwar Bhattacharya Lane. The students at the church are given milk and biscuits by the church authorities, while the NGO provides them with a light snack worth Re 1 daily.

 There are two permanent teachers at Pathchala, along with eight volunteers, some of whom are retired professionals. The NGO provides the children, hailing from slums in nearby Saheb Bagan, Masjidpara and Locker Math. The children are introduced to the mainstream education from here. 

 Talent in the arts does not go unnoticed either. The NGO has made arrangements for drawing and dance classes for those with a flair for them. 

 Jairam Shau, a Class IX student of Bharatiya Hindi High School, said: I have been coming here since I was in the sixth standard. I prefer to study here because of the disruptions at home. Jairams father sells puri-sabzi, and the paraphernalia of cooking makes it difficult for him to study. 

 But problems are aplenty, the gravest being the perennial paucity of funds. Not having received clearance under the Foreign Currency Regulation Act, the organisation can not apply for aid from foreign bodies. Presently, the NGO receives aid from Amways Opportunity Foundation, as well as the Rotary Club.

 Personal attempts at fund raising sustains Pathchala, with Gupta and Chatterjee even drawing up collections through their children residing in the US. Though the teachers admit they were helped greatly by Father Ignatius, the former in-charge of the church, they have been cold-shouldered since he left. Father Mondal, the present in-charge, explained: We need the room for our clinic for the underprivileged. We cant let it be used for classes even if we want to.

 What rsquo;s on your mind this week

 Shout out Loud

 Best of both worlds

 It is common for the previous generation to complain about the lsquo;pro-western rsquo; mindset and outlook of today rsquo;s boy and girls. I think change is a natural process. Without it, a certain stagnancy will develop.

 We are enjoying the fruits of a more liberal society today. Freedom needs to be given to boys and girls of our age. 

 The concept of lsquo;Western imperialism rsquo; is a misnomer. Western lifestyle is not only about drinking, smoking and drugs. People often complain of social and family dissensions because of Western lifestyles. But no trend can creep into a society unless accepted by people themselves. Whether underage alcoholism, illegal prostitution and iconoclasm are offshoots of a western lifestyle or not is tough to say. Western culture can rsquo;t have destroyed the lsquo;sanctity rsquo; of Indian society, for Indian society was never limited to one-tracked living. From time immemorial, with various foreign invasions, lifestyles had changed constantly. 

 Did gentleman not have women for entertainment earlier, while their wives were confined to boudoirs? Were the previous generations absolutely flawless compared to the constant disapproval faced by today rsquo;s generation? 

 This is not to support smoking among youngsters, underage alcohol or prostitution, but I will not associate them solely with western culture. It is only a way of living that people have adopted. There indeed needs to be some restraint in society. But parents need to be cautious about what a youngster wants, considering that times have changed drastically. Reportedly, parents who have been unable to accept the ways of the present generation, tend to suffer from frustration and despondency. In the same cycle, children too feel insecure and become rebellious. An equilibrium needs to be maintained between the past, present and future. Society needs more candour between children and parents; along with mutual interaction and cooperation.

 Spice it up

 Walking down Park Street towards Camac Street, one can see a number of roadside stalls selling anything from snacks to substantial South Indian, North Indian and Chinese meals. There are no hoardings to advertise the products. All that customers get is a plate of hot, fresh food at low cost served within five minutes.

 Street food in Calcutta reminds one of jhalmuri, bhelpuri, telebhaja, desi ice creams and kulfis and so on. The street food of my conservative definition had a special symbolic meaning. It had been constantly reminiscent of my teenage iconoclasm of disobeying the sermons of parents and pedagogues. My teenage attitude of eating non-nutritious food explains why these kinds of stalls always attract the teenagers.

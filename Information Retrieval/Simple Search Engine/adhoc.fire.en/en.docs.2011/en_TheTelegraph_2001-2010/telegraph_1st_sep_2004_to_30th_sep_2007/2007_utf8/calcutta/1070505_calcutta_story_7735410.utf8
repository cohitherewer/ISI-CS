The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Surgery suicide bid

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A penniless security guard tried to end his life on the Metro Railway tracks last week after being handed a long list of expensive medicines for the treatment of his daughter at SSKM Hospital. Hemanta Mohanta was saved by the members of an NGO. 

 He was on his way into the Netaji Bhavan station on Wednesday when members of Diganta, which is helping in the treatment of the three-year-old girl, stopped him. 

 Mohanta later confessed that he was entering the station to jump on the tracks. 

 Mohantas daughter Riya was born without a rectum a condition known as anorectal malformation. This prevented her from defecating. 

 She would have been operated on a year ago, had her father been able to provide for the expenses.

 Mohanta, a resident of Cheora village, in Bankura, earns around Rs 1,200 per month. He admitted Riya to the district hospital in 2004, the year she was born. The doctors referred her to NRS Hospital. 

 She was then treated at Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital, before being shifted to the paediatric surgery department of SSKM Hospital.

 Surgeons operated on her in May 2005 and carved out a channel in her abdomen to allow her to defecate, said Utpal Roy of Diganta.

 Mohanta had to sell a three-cottah plot to arrange for the treatment. 

 The surgery did not prove to be of much help and I had to admit my daughter to SSKM Hospital in April 2006, said Mohanta. 

 The doctor who attended to her asked me to get at least Rs 40,000 for another surgery. I told him that it was not possible for me to arrange the funds immediately. The doctor asked me to come back with my daughter a year later. I returned to my village and tried my best to save money, but failed, said a sobbing Mohanta.

 He brought Riya to SSKM on April 9 this year, after her condition worsened. He sold a pitcher to buy the passage. She was denied admission but was admitted on April 12, after intervention by the NGO. 

 But the doctors asked Mohanta to buy at least Rs 7,000-worth of medicines for the surgery.

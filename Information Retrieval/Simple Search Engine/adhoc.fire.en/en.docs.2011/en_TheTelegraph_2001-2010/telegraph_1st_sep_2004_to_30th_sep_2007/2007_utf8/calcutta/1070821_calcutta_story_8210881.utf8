 The Met offices forecast of heavy rain has put paid to the foreign tour plans of the civic top brass. The mayor, municipal commissioner, chief engineer (project and development) and the chief health officer are among those who have cancelled official tours abroad to meet the challenges posed by the monsoon in Calcutta. 

 While mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya cancelled his visit to Singapore, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, the first Indian bureaucrat selected as Eisenhower Fellow, did not go to Philadelphia for the final part of the fellowship seminar. 

 Chief engineer (project and development) Nilangshu Bose was headed for Bangkok for short-term training on micro-tunnelling technology and chief municipal health officer (CMOH) Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay was to attend a three-day refresher course on financial management in the healthcare sector, organised by Asian Development Bank in Kuala Lumpur. They have cancelled their programmes on their own. 

 Besides Singapore, I have a programme in Siliguri. I called off the visits after there was a forecast of heavy rain. What would people think if the city is flooded and I am abroad? said the mayor. 

 Bandyopadhyay said: Eisenhower Fellows have to attend two seminars this year. I had attended the first one in Dublin. The second will be held in Philadelphia for two months. I was to read a paper on the prospects and challenges of public-private partnership in urban renewal. In view of the weather condition and the waterlogging situation in the city, I have informed the organisers that I will not attend the seminar.

 The Eisenhower Fellowship foundation wrote to Bandyopadhyay: Since you have attended the first part of the seminar, you continue to be an Eisenhower Fellow. 

 Over the past 54 years, 1,700 men and women from 100 countries, including 50 from India, have been awarded the fellowships.

 I postponed my training since I thought it more essential to prepare drainage and sewage schemes to be submitted to the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, said chief engineer Bose.

 CMOH Chattopadhyay stated: Because of frequent rain and waterlogging in different pockets, it is more important for me to remain in the city and supervise the anti-dengue and anti-chikungunya drives than to attend short-term training on financial management abroad.

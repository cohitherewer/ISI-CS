 Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai in Guru

 The fans are giving the credit to their acting skills. The cynics are pinning the blame on their engagement timing. Whatever the reason, the box-office bottomline is that Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai have finally scored on screen together. Yes, its official, Guru has broken the January jinx of Bollywood flops and given Mani Ratnam his first Hindi hit.

 And as the films cinematographer Rajiv Menon told Metro from Chennai, the film is doing the best in Bengal, along with Mumbai and the South.

 Gurus east India distributor Shree Venkateshs Mahendra Soni confirms this: The net collections have been Rs 80 lakh from the 17 prints, with an average occupancy of 80 per cent.

 The figure is even higher at multiplexes, with the citys most popular plex INOX (Forum) registering an average of 85 per cent occupancy in the first 10 days. Says general manager Vikas Syal: Despite not being a family film per se, Guru has done really well. More than the wedding announcement, I think it is the positive word-of-mouth publicity that is at work.

 Enough for the Week Two figures to beat the Week One count? As exhibitor Arijit Dutta points out, Guru is the first film since Black, in February 2005, that has done better in the second week. Guru collected Rs 7.5 lakh in the first week at Priya and we expect to close the second week at Rs 9 lakh, he says.

 Now, if that doesnt have anything to do with Amitabhs formal soon to wed announcement about AB-Ash on January 14 Guru released on January 12 then what does?

 No surprises then that Venkateshs Soni is adding more prints of Guru in the coming weeks despite the starry line-up of Salaam-e-Ishq hitting theatres this Thursday. The number of Guru prints will go up to 20 to meet public demand, says the local distributor. It is the first hit of 2007 and new releases notwithstanding, it will continue to do well at the box-office.

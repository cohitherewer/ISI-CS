The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Surprise checks on test centres

 OUR BUREAU

 The government has threatened a crackdown on centres dishing out pollution under control (PUC) certificates without conducting proper auto-emission tests.

 Surprise checks will soon be carried out by inspectors of the motor vehicles department and officials of the state pollution control board.

 The day after Metro blew the lid off the farcical nature of tailpipe emission tests at four authorised centres, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury chaired a fact-finding meeting at Writers Buildings on Wednesday.

 We met for over an hour and decided on a series of measures, said Chowdhury after the meeting, that was attended by environment secretary M.L. Meena and senior officials from the transport and environment departments.

 Officials said random checks would be stepped up to force more vehicles to obtain PUC certificates, more auto-emission testing centres would be opened across the city and a campaign launched to raise awareness and compliance levels.

 Measures taken by the Maharashtra government, like denying fuel to vehicles without valid PUC certificates, were discussed. But that was done following a court order and we have to see whether such a measure can be implemented here, observed Chowdhury.

 Calcutta High Court is set to play a key role in the matter, with a public interest litigation filed earlier by Subhas Dutta, pleading for reduction in auto emission, implementation of an action plan to reduce air pollution, introduction of green fuel and proper functioning of the PUC centres.

 The case was heard on April 2, when Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar directed the government to submit an action-taken affidavit within seven weeks, when the case would be heard. Six weeks have passed, but the government is yet to file any affidavit, claimed petitioner Dutta.

 Meanwhile, foul fumes maim and kill Calcuttans (see box). An Asian Development Bank report in 2005 had warned that 2004-2014 would witness over 100,000 premature deaths due to particulate emission in Calcutta if drastic measures are not taken.

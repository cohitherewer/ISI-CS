 Review of CAS roll-out

 - Six weeks before set-top boxes reach all subscribers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 State information and cultural affairs principal secretary Dilip Chakraborty held a meeting with Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) chairman Nripendra Mishra at Writers Buildings on Wednesday to review the situation in areas where conditional access system (CAS) has been implemented on December 31.

 The system was launched in Alipore, New Alipore, Behala, Chetla, Budge Budge, Garden Reach, Thakurpukur, Tollygunge, Haridevpur and Mahestala in the first phase.

 According to Chakraborty, the main topic of discussion was the alleged illegal airing of analogue signals post-CAS by Srishti, an organisation of cable operators which was recently recognised as an multi-system operator (MSO). 

 We have not revoked their licence, but let them go with a warning. We have asked Srishti to mend its ways if it wants to continue as an MSO. It needs to cooperate with us and not get involved in activities that could sabotage the CAS roll-out. The warning is not only for Srishti, but all MSOs in the city, Chakraborty announced at Writers. 

 He said less than 15 per cent of the cable subscribers who have opted for pay channels have been provided with set-top boxes (STBs). All the MSOs must make an initiative to bridge the demand-supply gap as soon as possible. 

 Chakraborty added: The demand for STBs, which are a must for viewing pay channels, is rising steadily. The MSOs are guilty of not stocking the gadget in sufficient numbers. All the MSOs have placed orders for the device simultaneously and it will not be available before six to eight weeks.

 Abhijit Sanyal, the nodal officer appointed by TRAI to oversee the implementation process, claimed that many of the cable operators who were a part of Srishti had left the organisation. We will wait three months before CAS is rolled out in other parts of the city, he said.

 Srishti shareholder Gautam Roy denied that the MSO had aired analogue signals.

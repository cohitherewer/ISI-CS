 Helpless in fume fight

 The state government is keen on curbing auto emission in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA), but a few court orders and the Centres lack of cooperation have left its hands tied.

 This was the crux of the governments affidavit on auto emission, submitted to Calcutta High Court on Monday.

 The affidavit, affirmed by the principal secretary in the transport department, iterated the states resolve to phase out old vehicles in the CMA.

 The government had issued a notification in 2002, stating that vehicles older that 15 years would not be allowed to ply in the CMA. The notification was challenged before a single-judge bench of the high court, which set it aside. The states appeal against the order is pending with a division bench, the affidavit stated.

 The government, however, indicated that it is considering issuing a fresh notice to ban old vehicles in the CMA.

 The affidavit pointed out that introduction of compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) could significantly bring down auto emission.

 But even after repeated appeals, the Centre is not extending us any cooperation in supplying CNG. We are also not getting enough LPG, the affidavit claimed.

 It also argued that unless the central act on issuance of permits is revised, the government cannot impose any restriction on the movement of vehicles in the city.

 The government claimed that even in adverse situations, it had taken all steps to curb air pollution, including checking fuel standards and auto-emission levels. 

 We know that pollution is a threat to the city. But what can we do in this situation? the government submitted. 

 It invited suggestions from the court and environment activists on ways to solve the problem.

 The affidavit was submitted following a court order on a petition filed by the environmentalist, Subhas Dutta, who sought judicial intervention in curbing auto emission.

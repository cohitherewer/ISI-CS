The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Goodies for AbAsh bash

 - North Calcutta sweet shop eyes platter at Prateeksha, jewellery consignment leaves from Gol Park

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Aishwarya Rai has competition. From Moushumi or Dilkhush or Sourabh. Or maybe all of the above. For these Calcutta beauties are sure to appeal to Abhishek Bachchans sweet tooth. But then, Ash loves them all herself, right from her Chokher Bali days.

 Confused? The sweetest thing in Prateeksha, Juhu, later this week will be a platter from a 163-year-old sweet shop in Hedua, north Calcutta if a selection of sandesh from Girish Chandra Dey amp; Nakur Chandra Nandy makes its way to the AbAsh wedding on April 20.

 Nakur is pinning its hopes on film-maker Rituparno Ghosh, who will be attending the big, fat Bollywood wedding. He is a regular patron and when he dropped in for samples late last week, we assumed they were for the wedding. Nothing has been confirmed, but we are are hoping our sandesh reaches the Bachchan home, Pronab Nandy, great-grandson of Nakur Chandra Nandy and one of the partners of the sweet shop, told Metro on Monday.

 The samples from the famed sandesh-only address range from novelties like Parijat and Moushumi to the regular Jolbhora (see chart). Ghosh who has directed Aishwarya, Abhishek, Jaya and now Amitabh said he was a big fan of Nakur and would be proud as a Calcuttan and a Bengali if the sandesh did make its way to Mumbai. 

 Theres been no talk of a wedding order being placed, but Ash (Chokher Bali and Raincoat) and Jayadi (Sunglass) both love the Nakur sandesh, said the film-maker.

 One definite Calcutta connection will be Anjali Jewellers. We have really worked hard on the collection (Ashs wedding jewellery) but we dont have permission from the Bachchan family to talk about it, said Anargha Chowdhury, co-proprietor of Anjali Jewellers, after a vital consignment left the Gol Park branch on Monday. 

 Anjali Jewellers had designed Ashs jewellery in Chokher Bali and Abhisheks armlet in Antarmahal.

 And then there is Sharbari Duttas trousseau 17 pieces for Abhishek (sherwani, kurta, angrakha, achkan, chadars, stoles) and 13 more family and friends.

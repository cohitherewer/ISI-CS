 Fire fee for theatres slashed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In view of the sorry state of standalone theatres in and around the city, the state government has decided to slash the annual fire licence fee it charges them.

 Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said on Monday the annual fee for the fire safety certificate for air-conditioned theatres in the city will be brought down to Rs 7,500 from Rs 20,000. 

 For non-airconditioned theatres, this fee will be pared down to Rs 4,000 annually. The new rates will be effective from June 15, he said.

 No new theatres have come up in the city in recent times. Standalone theatres face the problem of decreasing footfall and have virtually become a sick industry. Keeping these problems in mind, we agreed to hall-owners pleas, said the minister. 

 This relaxation will cost the fire services department around Rs 20 lakh annually. But officials said the theatre-owners rarely paid the original amount. 

 Chatterjee said the revenue will be replenished by mopping resources by tightening fire safety norms for new hotels, malls and multi-storeyed buildings coming up in the city. Recruitment of pass-outs from the fire services institute will be made mandatory.

 Theft at gold workshop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gold ornaments worth Rs 36 lakh were stolen from a jewellery workshop on Prem Chand Boral Street, in the Muchipara police station area, on Wednesday night. Police suspect a few insiders were involved in the theft.

 A preliminary probe suggests that it was insiders job, though we are also trying to find out whether any professional thief was involved, said an officer of Muchipara police station.

 The theft was detected by the owner of the workshop on Thursday morning. The main gate was locked. Nobody had entered the workshop after it was closed on Wednesday night. Apparently, someone had stolen the jewellery before the workshop was closed on Wednesday night, another officer said.

 A team from the local police station and another from the burglary section of the detective department inspected the shop on Friday and spoke to the employees.

 The vault containing the jewellery was open. We have taken fingerprints of some of the employees and will compare them with those on the vault, an officer added.

 The police have alerted all shop-owners in view of the upcoming festive season. Plainclothesmen have been deployed in the market areas.

 We have arrested three shoplifters in the Prem Chand Boral Street area last week, the officer added.

 The deputy commissioner of police (detective department), Ajoy Kumar, said a special team has been formed to check thefts. Every year, thieves from nearby districts come to Calcutta before the Puja.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Two road mishaps, two dead, 15 hurt

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two young men were killed and at least 15 people were injured in road mishaps in the city on Sunday night and Monday morning.

 The first accident, which claimed the lives, took place on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass when a motorcycle collided with a bus. 

 The other mishap, involving a state bus and a truck, occurred on Strand Road.

 The motorcycle was headed north when it collided with the bus near Chowbagha. Witnesses said the two-wheeler was being driven at a very high speed on the poorly illuminated road, which was almost empty at the late hour. 

 The bus, too, was travelling fast in the opposite direction. The collision occurred as the motorcyclist tried to speed past the bus.

 The bus driver slammed the brakes, but the vehicle did not stop immediately. The pillion rider was thrown off at a distance. The rider received heavy head injuries, said an officer of Tiljala police station. 

 Alerted by the sound of the collision, the police jeep on patrol rushed to the spot. But the two men succumbed to their injuries before they could be shifted to hospital. 

 The men were later identified as Sanjeev Mondal, 32, and Bapi Ghosh. Mondal lived in Maniktala, while Ghosh hailed from Duttabad, in Bidhannagar. The bus driver fled.

 Officers of the police station said the stretch of the Bypass near Chowbhaga has not been properly illuminated, despite repeated pleas to the state traffic police. 

 There has not been a single inspection of the area by senior officers of the state traffic police department in the past few months, claimed the officers of Tiljala police.

 The stretch has witnessed a sudden rise in vehicular traffic. It becomes difficult to drive after sunset, as the sharp bends cant be made out. Lights and pointers must be installed to avoid a repeat of the mishap. The administration must pay attention to the stretch, said an officer.

 Early on Monday, at least 15 passengers of a Calcutta Surface Transport Corporation bus were injured when a truck hit the vehicle from the behind.

 The accident took place around 7.25 am. The bus was travelling north down Strand Road when the truck hit it near Raja Katra.

 The injured were taken to Medical College and Hospital by the local residents. The truck driver has been arrested.

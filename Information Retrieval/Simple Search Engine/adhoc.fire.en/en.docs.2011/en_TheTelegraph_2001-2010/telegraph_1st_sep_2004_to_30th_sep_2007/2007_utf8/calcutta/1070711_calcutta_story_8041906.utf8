The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hi, Harry on Friday the 13th

 - 15 prints for Bengal territory means all the plexes can screen at least six shows daily

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

 Good news for all you Potterheads out there. Unlike the last time (owing to a distributor-exhibitor tussle), you will not have to wait till Monday to catch the new Harry Potter movie at a multiplex. Order of the Phoenix is arriving at all four multiplexes on Friday the 13th.

 A five-print rise from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in November 2005, the Bengal territory will get 15 of the 250 prints that are India-bound. Thats enough for the plexes INOX (Forum and City Centre), 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi) and Fame (Hiland Park) to screen at least six daily shows of the fifth Potter movie. Nandan, New Empire, Ashoka and Malancha will also see a Friday release, and Daniel Radcliffe can be heard in Hindi at Basusree and Mitra.

 Pottermania at the theatres is assured, but the 250-print count for India is dwarfed by the 588 prints for Spider-Man 3 this May. Each film has its own distribution strategy and we have gone as wide as we would like to with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Sanjay Narayanan, the marketing manager of Warner Bros. India, tells Metro.

 The popularity of Potter has forced Warner Bros. to distribute the film directly to the Calcutta plexes and let Kushagra Arts handle the movie in most of the other theatres in Bengal. For Goblet, the local distributor-exhibitor showdown had denied Potter fans a multiplex tryst with their hero for the first three days. When a film is an international day-date release, everyone would want to catch it straightaway, says Vikas Syal, the general manager of INOX (Forum).

 That there is no big Bollywood release the Bobby Deol-Akshaye Khanna-starrer Naqaab is the only Hindi one on Friday makes things even happier for Harry and gang. A grand initial once the counters open on Wednesday is assured, as its a must-watch for every Potter follower, points out local distributor Kushagra Jalan. Block-booking requests are pouring in at plexes across the country, adds Narayanan of Warner Bros. 

 A gentle word of caution: Order of the Phoenix bears a U/A rating, so if you are not yet 18, please take an adult along to say Alohomora!.

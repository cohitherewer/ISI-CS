The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Maxi taxis from airport

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Tata Winger will turn into an air-conditioned taxi 

The state government is set to introduce air-conditioned maxi taxis that will run from the airport to Garia, and to Rabindra Sadan.

 The government will purchase 50 Tata Wingers, which have just been launched, for the service. Each vehicle will seat 13 passengers.

 The maxi cabs for Garia will ply through EM Bypass, while those bound for Rabindra Sadan will take the AJC Bose route.

 The service will start on an experimental basis. We may change the schedule, judging by the response. The fare has been fixed at Rs 25, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 The West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC) will run the vehicles along with a private operator.

 Chowdhury expressed the hope that the introduction of maxi taxis will lead to withdrawal of shuttle cars that ply illegally from the airport and Salt Lake.

 The transport department is trying to ensure that the maxi cabs are allowed up to the domestic terminal, for which permission will be sought from the airport authorities.

 The WBSTC now runs Whiteliner buses on a franchisee basis from the airports Gate No. 1 to Santragachhi, Joka and Garia. But the service, according to commuters, is irregular. The CSTC buses on the airport-Garia route face the same allegation.

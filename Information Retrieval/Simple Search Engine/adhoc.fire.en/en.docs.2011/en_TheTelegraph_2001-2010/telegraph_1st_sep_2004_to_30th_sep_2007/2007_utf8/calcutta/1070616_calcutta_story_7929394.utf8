The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Yasmine Bleeth

 You are a big thinker, with big ideas and a lot of capacity for thought. A self-made person, you always learn from experience. You have a pretty good idea of how to get things done fairly and profitably. Although a bit uncertain about emotions, you are an affectionate and considerate lover.

 Kusum Bhandari

 Corporate hand of help 

 SAHELI MITRA

 Imagine a corporate honcho being rewarded by his company for mobilising people for a blood donation camp! 

 Well, an innovative idea that Vesuvius India plans to execute, ensuring direct involvement of its employees in social activities rather than just making donations for a social cause. Other corporate houses in the city are not far behind.

 Employees of TCS and their wives make rounds of Calcuttas poorest wards, identifying pockets that need adult literacy. ITC, with its project e-chaupal, targets 3.5 million farmers, helping them become economically self-sufficient, while IBM employees hold classes for underprivileged students as part of their computer literacy programme.

 Corporate donations seem to be a pass and corporate social responsibility is being redefined. Direct employee involvement is far better than cash donation. There is every chance of the cash not being spent for the right purpose, feels Sanjoy Dutta, the executive director (finance) of Vesuvius India. 

 Employees, on the other hand, feel satisfied when they can do something for the masses, he adds.

 Keeping this in mind, companies like TCS have formed an umbrella organisation, Maitreyi, with their employees and their wives. We have identified certain NGOs to target people below poverty level. Building schools, setting up other infrastructural facilities for them and increasing their employability are part of our agenda, says TCS principal consultant R.N. Lahiri.

 Some corporate houses are, however, working closer home. We choose needy contractual employees who are not our direct employees. We adopt promising children from their families and award them scholarships. We are also working closely with factory workers from villages, helping them form a cooperative and build houses for them, says Saibal Bandopadhyay, the operations manager of Vesuvius India.

 Companies like PwC and IBM are more into giving free consultations. Our employees take up survey and research work free for various NGOs and help mobilise international funds for them, says Ambarish Dasgupta, the executive director of PwC. 

 IBM employees have created a module for their ongoing computer literacy programme. This three-and-a-half month course is free of cost and is held in batches of 35 students. More employees want to participate in the teaching process. Three batches have already completed the course, remarks an IBM official.

 ITCs Mission Sunehra Kal helps rural women create sustainable livelihood through value chain-based enterprises like Chikankari. 

 Our employees buy products directly from weavers and farmers to ensure that they get better value for their yield, says Rekha Kapoor of ITC Marketing. We set up small stores for farmers or hold exhibitions for weavers, adds Sharmishtha Roy Chowdhury, HR executive, ITC.

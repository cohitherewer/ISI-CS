 Visa case rap for CID

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Monday came down on the CID for its handling of cases involving foreign nationals.

 The department should be more cautious while dealing with such cases, Justice Asim Roy observed. He asked the CID deputy inspector-general, Niraj Narayan Pandey, to verify the visas of three Bangladeshi nationals, languishing in jail for more than 40 days, by September 14.

 The judge also asked Pandey to consider whether action could be taken against the officer looking after the case of the Bangladeshi nationals.

 The order followed a petition by Biplab Rahman, Mohammad Rafiqul Mondal and Mohammad Babulal, who alleged that they had been arrested even after producing genuine documents.

 Their lawyer K. Bhattacharya said the three had come to the country on May 10. They were arrested in Kasba on August 1 on the charge that their passport and visa were forged. The allegations were false.

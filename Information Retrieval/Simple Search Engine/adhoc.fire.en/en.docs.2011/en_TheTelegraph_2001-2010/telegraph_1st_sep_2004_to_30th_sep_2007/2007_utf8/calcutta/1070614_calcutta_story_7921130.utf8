 organised a career fair on June

 9 and 10 at the college auditorium. 

 It was inaugurated by Ashok Ranjan Thakur, vice-chancellor of West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT), along with Fr Mathew, principal, St Xaviers College. 

 The fair opened doors to a full house of students. Day One began with a discussion on Media as a Career with speakers Samir Goswami, senior PRO, Eastern Railway, journalist Subrata Nagchoudhury, DJ Jimmy Tangree and Snehasis Sur. 

 Tangree said: Today, radio offers many jobs including marketing, branding and PR. But completing studies is the priority, he cautioned, over the lure of easy money. 

 Nagchoudhury felt that with more regional channels coming up everyday, there will be greater scope of jobs. In another session titled Basic Sciences vs career oriented Programmes D.J. Chattopadhyay, dean of science, Calcutta University, said: Family pressure diverts a student from making the correct academic choice. You cannot learn anything unless you enjoy it. 

As many as 20 stalls offered a plethora of courses. Health Care Management International (HCMI), a recruitment organisation for healthcare professionals was offering an MBBS course at seven institutes in the Philippines as part of a tie-up with the south-eastern country. 

 In countries like Russia and China where students have to spend extra time learning the language before starting on their courses, they can study in English there, informed Ritesh Haga, director, India operations of HCMI. Prerna Kothari of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, said: We came across several institutes offering new-age career courses. The Prosper Overseas stall informed us about educational opportunities abroad. 

 A discussion to guide civil service aspirants focussing on the state included eminent civil servants on the second day. Ram Ghosh, ex-dean, St Xaviers College, emphasised on subject selections in the civil services exam. Arun Prasad Mukherjee, an IPS officer, said: Your greatness as an IAS officer lies in retiring from service with your head high, while you do something for the common people.

 A cheque of Rs 2,00,000, obtained from the fair, was handed over to Fr Mathew for the proposed campus at the Bypass coming up in 2010.

 Shout out loud

 Whats on your mind this week

 Look

 where youre

 going

 Calcutta

 Club and the Bengal National Chamber

 of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI)

 recently conducted seminars and

 exhibitions on various topics, including

 the menace of road accidents, health

 and medicare. 

 The three-day event offered free health check-ups and had health products on display. 

 In the seminar, Road Traffic Accidents Prevention and the Golden Hour, the objective was to make people aware of the consequences of reckless driving and of crossing roads carelessly. The participants were told how first aid should be administered to an accident victim. The seminar also brought to light the drawbacks of traffic conditions in the city.

 According to the experts present at the seminar, ambulances running in the city are not well-equipped and can hardly help those in a critical condition. They merely work as a means of transport but cannot provide initial treatment.

 When an accident takes place, most onlookers prefer to chase down the driver and beat him up when they should ideally be attending to the victim to take him to hospital. In the skirmish, the victim is very often left behind to fend for himself. 

 One ought to first inform the police and call for an ambulance when there is a road accident, the speakers said. 

 The speakers were of the opinion that errant drivers should not be imprisoned. Rather, they should be shown the consequences of their mistakes that has a more lasting impact than punitive measures. 

 Forty seven per cent of those injured or killed in road accidents are pedestrians. If drivers were more careful and people on the road stuck to traffic rules, many of these accidents could be averted, the experts felt.

 Empty world?

 Has the

 popular television channel, MTV

 spawned a generation that can have

 an Empty We feeling about themselves? Are we really empty within? Life has been reduced to a 30-minute flick today instant coffee and fast food are the symbols of todays life. The youth of today want their dreams to be fulfilled in an instant, like the coffee they sip. 

 The culture represented by MTV is borrowed from the west and serves to tempt the perpetually confused youth. 

 What we see is what we believe. A person hooked on to MTV believes the world on the screen to be true. He loves to imitate the extensively tattooed man in a pair of dangerously low-waist jeans.

 What are we learning? Knowledge is welcome today but only if it promises the moolah. 

 You find students holding fasts and shouting slogans in youthful fervour. Once out of college, the scenario changes. Most of these youths who were ready to die for idealism, chase their dreams of success in the western world. 

 The fact is most of the youth these days are unable to think for themselves. They are bedazzled by the world presented on the silver screen. In fact, the entire system is responsible for such emptiness. There is no one to blame and no one makes an effort to change the system. The void increases and the emptiness in ones mind takes its toll day in and day out.

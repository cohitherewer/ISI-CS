 Cell for global trade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government is getting ready to tackle issues related to global trade as the volume of international business and flow of cross-border capital reaches a high in India.

 The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT), a leading research and training institute in international business, is supporting the governments efforts by coming forward to set up a World Trade Organisation (WTO) cell for the state on its Salt Lake campus.

 The cell, inaugurated on Wednesday by Nirupam Sen, the state minister of commerce and industry, is a joint venture of the government and IIFT. The cell will assist the government in identifying the areas that need to be focussed upon.

 In this age of the global market, one needs to look at the impact of the numerous treaties being signed. The impact of market taxes will also have to be monitored, said T.K. Chacko, the director of IIFT.

 IIFT, which was set up by the Central ministry of commerce in 1963, already has a number of research centres dealing with international trade, including the Centre for WTO Studies, Centre for International Trade and Technology and the Centre for Small and Medium Enterprises.

 The WTO cell of the state will disseminate information among policy-makers, government officials and trade and industry bodies on all WTO-related issues affecting the industry, agriculture and service sectors. Providing consultation and research support to the state government will also be part of the agenda of the cell.

 Its responsibilities include analysis of opportunities and benefits for the state government as a result of the signing of various free trade agreements (FTAs) as well as advice on policy measures to maximise such benefits.

 The cell should play a proactive role in analysing the WTO regime while keeping in mind the states strengths and weaknesses. It should make all stakeholders, particularly the trade and industry, an integral part of the process, said minister Sen.

 He also suggested that the cell should interact with the stakeholders to bring out relevant issues so as to provide pertinent policy inputs.

 The minister also asked the WTO cell to create a state-specific trade database.

 Men in mufti on trains, at station

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 The Government Railway Police (GRP) has chalked out a security scheme for Howrah station, with emphasis on pre-emptive tracking down of criminals and surveillance by personnel in plainclothes.

 Pradip K. Sanyal, superintendent of GRP, said special task forces (STFs) have been set up and given adequate equipment to track down a criminal before he can cause any damage to the station or trains.

 The move follows the discovery of a crude bomb in a crowded coach of a local train at the station a few weeks ago.

 It is always better to identify and intercept a criminal before he can do any damage. The STFs will try to do this through special methods, Sanyal explained. He, however, refused to elaborate on the special methods, citing security reasons.

 The STFs, working in plainclothes, will be deployed both on the station premises and the trains.

 Special care will be taken to ensure passengers are not harassed, Sanyal said.

 As part of the security boost-up, the Howrah GRP has also spent Rs 1 lakh to procure 10 dogs.

 They are being trained at the Police Training College, in Barrackpore. We hope to deploy them in a year, said an officer.

 Two of these dogs are Alsatian and the rest are Labrador. Four hand-held metal detectors have also been procured for the force.

 The GRP is also laying special emphasis on curbing dacoity on trains.

 This is a real menace. On an average, the Howrah GRP registers around 40 cases of robbery on trains in a month, including instances of passengers being drugged by the criminals, the officer pointed out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Campus amp; crime

 I remember the evening I moved into my apartment on 57th Street in Hyde Park, Chicago. The lead story on local television that evening was a carjacking and a shooting on 59th and Cottage Grove. Located at the intersection of 57th and Cottage Grove, my apartment was right at the border, if you will. The border, the University of Chicago Police, had told incoming students in their briefing, was a lakshman rekha that separated the predominantly white university neighbourhood from the African-American ghetto that all but surrounded it, though race was never mentioned. Security issues in urban US campuses in the 90s were largely those of ensuring that the street and gang crimes plaguing the cities did not affect those associated with the university.

 The university was a safe place. Crime would come in the form of illegal alcohol or drug use, sexual assaults, rapes, or date rapes. Most of the campus alert notices were about rape perpetrators, convicts on the run, who might be near campuses. The occasional pilfering and thefts were always there, and in fact the only time my name went into the police files was when a suspicious-looking man walked into my office and started asking me about the whereabouts of a woman whose name I could not identify. When the department secretary noticed him rummaging her bag, she came seeking help in apprehending him. We got to the campus police, who came right away, and found the man in the floor below. He turned out to be a prisoner who had jumped parole and states. This was in Lawrence, Kansas, a university town quite like Blacksburg, and it might as well have been in Calcutta.

 After all, it does not require a lot to walk into any college campus in Calcutta. The occasional student from another college or even a local rowdy might come into the college. The only security drill I ever went through was when I (as a student of St Xaviers College) went to Loreto College regarding the hosting of a musical event.

 Unlike Indian colleges that have to deal with physical ragging that regularly claim lives and minds, the US colleges offer a safe environment for education and enjoyment. Further, no amount of political differences lead to violence. If one contrasts this with what happens in Indian colleges, where superannuated political dadas still try to manage college elections, or the recent goings-on in Jadavpur University, then US universities are peaceful places where one can engage in political discussions without fear of drawing physical harm.

 Educational institutions are public places that have to be open to people. Does the Virginia Tech violence warrant barriers, checks, and detectors on campus? That would be succumbing to either fear because of a one-off incident or to the siege mentalit, which wants to make the gated community the only way to live in these times.

 Shout out loud

 Whats on your mind this week

 A walk down young Calcutta

 A walk

 down the changing roads of Calcutta,

 you cant escape a couple of surprises.

 Firstly, multiplexes, residential projects, shopping complexes, food joints and most importantly, Sector V, are where the next generation of the Bengali bhadrolok is going to come from. 

 The college crowd and young couples have bid the Maidan good-bye. You will now find them at Barista sipping coffee. 

 Secondly, every time you look up to read the hoardings, your senses are assaulted by the Buladi campaign. We hear the campaign is over but Buladi still towers at you as enormous as ever. 

 Undoubtedly, some Calcuttans relive the popularity of her campaigns through SMS jokes. 

 But will this fast paced city just change its face? Or will it change its soul as well? 

 Lets wait and watch.

 East is the best

 The North

 may brag about its manicured gardens

 and the perfect-to-be-photographed

 painted hills by the majestic lakes

 This is what the East lacks and this is its forte. And I am speaking of the Arunachal.

 If one compares the beauty of the North to a supermodel scorching the ramp, the East may very well be compared to the girl who looks good just as she is, fresh and simple. 

 The East is vast and its virgin forests are full of mysteries, a lot of it still to be discovered. The trees and plants look alive as if they will turn around and speak to you. They look happy, visibly so. 

 In the pristine hills of Arunachal Pradesh, cloaked in fountains of fern and miles of a rugged terrain full of strawberry blossom, one can actually feel closer to God. The unbelievably clear rivulets and streams are divine, as are the waterfalls, which give the impression of being frozen in motion.

 There are rhododendrons of every colour, growing in profusion in every direction you look. 

 One may get lucky and catch a glimpse of the not-so-well-known but nevertheless stunning Brahminy ducks, their white wings and pink chests merging with the snow capped mountain tops. 

 You have to see them to understand why they are considered auspicious by the locals a simple and gracious race, away from the hustle of city life.

 A lucky few have visited these awesome hills and a blessed few will visit them in the future. 

 But we all must share the responsibility of keeping the place intact and free from filth.

 Mrinalini Basu,

 Loreto College

 Gunshot rocks Assembly

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The West Bengal Assembly. A Telegraph picture 

 A bullet fired from the carbine of a head constable in a toilet of the Assembly on Wednesday evening set off panic on the premises.

 The cop, Tapan Mondol, has been suspended and a probe ordered to ascertain whether the bullet was fired accidentally or intentionally, said P.K. Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 The incident occurred around 5 pm, 15 minutes after the House was adjourned for the day. As soon as the shot rang out, securitymen from all over the premises rushed in and broke open the toilet door. The bullet had left a gaping hole on the toilet wall.

 It seems that Mondal didnt adhere to the safety norms. Or else, the catch of the weapon should have been locked, said an officer.

 Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim was first to react to the sound of the gunshot. Acting on Halims instruction, marshal Jayanta Majumder stepped out and inquired about it. 

 The Assembly has 20 dedicated securitymen. About 130 members of the armed force assist them while the House is in session.

 A golden journey

 Half a century is a long period and to survive for so long, dedicated to the theatre of conscience, is no mean feat, and Sundaram has achieved this with flying colours. So now its time for celebration. A year-long festival beginning today, has been slated to commemorate the occasion. The first phase of this programme begins today with Reliance Suvarno Sundaram, a five-day festival of plays from the Sundaram repertoire, written and directed by its founder member, dramatist, actor Manoj Mitra. Curtain to this prestigious cultural event will be raised this afternoon at Academy of Fine Arts at 3 pm with a play-reading of Ja Nei Bharote. Manoj Mitras take on the great epic, Mahabharta, is from a very different perspective and hence, very contemporary and refreshing. Distinguished actors from various theatre groups of Calcutta will present a shruti-natak (play-reading) of this play. Participants include: Ashok Mukhopadhyay, Meghnad Bhattacharjee, Soumitra Mitra, Koushik Sen, Shyamal Chakraborty, Prabir Dutta, Anish Ghosh, Suranjana Dasgupta, Dolon Roy, Mayuri Ghosh, Sushmita Hati and Manoj Mitra. The presentation will be conducted by Bibhas Chakraborty. In the evening at 6.30 pm, the historical play, Galpo Hekimsaheb (a still from the play appears here), will be staged. This classic Sundaram production is often considered a milestone in Bengali theatre. Directed by Mitra, this play has been revived after a long hiatus and the audience will be treated to a rare fare today.

 Event: Five-day theatre festival by Sundaram When: Till August 19; 6.30 pm (Today at 3 pm amp; 6.30 pm) Where: Academy of Fine Arts (August 15 - 17) amp; Madhusudan Mancha (August 19)

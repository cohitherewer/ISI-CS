 Cricket plus cruise

 - WORLD CUP WATER TOUR PACKAGES

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Cricket, cruise and calypso the countdown for the World Cup on the Caribbean islands has begun and the fans are preparing to float from one venue to the other. 

 The cost of the tour packages announced for the sporting extravaganza has, however, forced many an itinerant fan to back out. On the other hand, first-timers are drawn to the prospect of combining cricket with a cruise.

 The eight-night, 12-night and 20-night packages cost between Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 5.8 lakh, excluding airport taxes and visa charges. The cruises will initially be stationed in Barbados, from where they will sail overnight to venues like Grenada and St Lucia.

 There are several last-minute bookings, but some regular travellers are not going to West Indies because of the expense involved, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI).

 The packages were about 50 per cent cheaper during the last World Cup in South Africa, he observed.

 Some tourists are apprehensive about the facilities that will be available. Actor Jeet said he would have definitely attended if the World Cup was in Australia.

 Sachin Rampal of Thomas Cook, India, stated: There have been substantial bookings, many of them individual, for Team India matches. The response is better than that for the last World Cup.

 With the hotels on the islands booked for the World Cup, the tour operators are forced to plan packages with a cruise. The guests will sail from one venue to another, starting with the crucial Group Eight matches.

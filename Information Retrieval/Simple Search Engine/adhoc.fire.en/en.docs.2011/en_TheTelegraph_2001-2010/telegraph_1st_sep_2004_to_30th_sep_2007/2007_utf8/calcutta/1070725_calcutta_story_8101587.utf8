 Green light for ferry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The ferry service in the Kestopur canal will resume on August 5. A team of officials from various agencies involved in the project will conduct a trial run on Friday.

 The decision was formalised on Tuesday at a meeting attended by representatives of Hidco, transport department, police and fire service, as well as the chairmen of the Bidhannagar, Rajarhat and North and South Dum Dum municipalities.

 The West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation will operate the service, for which Hidco has earmarked Rs 30 crore. The money will be spent on buying four launches, dredging the canal, constructing five jetties, and arranging power supply and other facilities.

 The service on the 6.4-km stretch between Chitpur and Baisakhi will continue from 8am to 6pm. During rush hours in the morning and evening, the launches will ply at an interval of 35 minutes.

 The stops on the route are Chitpur, RG Kar, Ultadanga, Lake Town and Baisakhi. The service will be extended to Rajarhat with stops at Tank No. 8 (in Salt Lake), Nayapatti and New Town after two months. The fares will range from Rs 3 to Rs 5.

 The ferry service was started on an experimental basis in September last year, but was discontinued after the canal was found unsuitable for navigation. During the first trial run on August 8, two launches carrying ministers and bureaucrats got stuck in the silt near Ultadanga. 

 The VIPs had to get off the vessels midway and irrigation department officials had to face the wrath of housing minister Goutam Deb for not desilting the canal properly.

 Sadhan Das, the former irrigation secretary and technical adviser to the Hidco chairman, downplayed the incident on Tuesday.

 The launch used in the trial run was too big and heavy for the Kestopur canal. The 63-ft-long vessel was of the type that plies in the Sunderbans. This time, were deploying 42-ft-long launches which can carry 50 passengers each, he said. The launches will be flat-bottomed.

 The civic chairmen expressed the fear that the ferry service would raise the water level in the Kestopur canal and affect the citys drainage system. 

 Hidco officials, however, did not agree with the view. Water from Bagjola canal now drains into Kestopur canal. We explained to the chairmen that water would continue to flow into Kestopur canal even after the launches start plying.

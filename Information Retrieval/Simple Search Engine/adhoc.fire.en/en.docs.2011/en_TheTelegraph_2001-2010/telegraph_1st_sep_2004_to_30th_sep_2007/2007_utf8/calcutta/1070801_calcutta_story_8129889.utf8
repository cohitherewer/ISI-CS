 Nursing link to baby safety

 More than 11 lakh babies die each year before they are a month old, while another 5 lakh die between the ages of two and 12 months, according to the Breast-Feeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI).

 However, 22 per cent of neonatal deaths can be prevented if breast-feeding is started in the first hour of birth. India ranks sixth amongst eight south Asian countries in implementation of policies, programmes and practices of breast-feeding. 

 The BPNI encourages women to breast-feed their babies for the first six months and continue the practice for at least two years along with adequate complementary feeding. 

 The network is organising World Breast-Feeding Week from August 1. The theme is initiation of breast-feeding in the first hour of childbirth. 

 The World Breast-Feeding Week is all about making mothers aware of the advantages of feeding their baby in the first hour of its birth, says Parbati Sengupta, the state co-ordinator of the BPNI and paediatrician attached to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan.

 The awareness week will commence with a conference at College of Nursing, on the SSKM hospital campus. The programme will be attended by the BPNI members and paediatricians from across the city. 

 Breast-feeding improves the reflexes of a child and ensures that he or she gets Oxytocin, a hormone produced in the mothers body, useful for the growth of the child.

 Breast milk nourishes babies and develops immunity. Breast-fed babies have lower rates of ear infection, diarrhoea, rashes and allergies than bottle-fed babies, says Sengupta. 

 Specialists recommend that babies be breast-fed for at least the six to 12 months. Human milk contains the right amount of fatty acids, lactose, water and amino acids for digestion, brain development and growth, adds Sengupta. Breast-feeding also burns calories, helping the mother to lose the weight put on during pregnancy.

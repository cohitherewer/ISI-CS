The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Gloria Estefan

 You are a good judge of people. You are a born diplomat, endowed with a careful and secretive mind. At work, you are graceful and perfect, so people rarely have ill-feelings about you. Self sufficient solo work suits you better than teamwork. In relationships, you have the logic and common sense to take the good with the bad.

 Kusum Bhandari

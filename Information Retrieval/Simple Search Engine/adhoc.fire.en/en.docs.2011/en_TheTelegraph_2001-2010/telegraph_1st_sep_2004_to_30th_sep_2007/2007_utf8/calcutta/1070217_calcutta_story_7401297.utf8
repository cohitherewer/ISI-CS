 The soul of ikebana

 A traditional Japanese form of flower arrangement, ikebana creates a harmony of linear construction, rhythm and colour. Emphasizing the linear aspects of the arrangement, its entire structure is based on three main points that symbolize heaven, earth and humankind. Consulate-General of Japan and Ikenobo Calcutta Chapter present Ikebana 2007, a ikebana demonstration by Toshiharu OKA, of Ikenobo, Japan. Considered the place of ikebanas origin, Ikenobos history encompasses both traditional and modern, and encourages new development in todays ikebana. Changes over the centuries in customs and living environments are reflected in the evolution of Ikenobos ikebana styles. Each age has brought new challenges for ikebana to express the spirit of the time. The styles in tomorrows display include rikka, shoka and, specially, the modern free style.

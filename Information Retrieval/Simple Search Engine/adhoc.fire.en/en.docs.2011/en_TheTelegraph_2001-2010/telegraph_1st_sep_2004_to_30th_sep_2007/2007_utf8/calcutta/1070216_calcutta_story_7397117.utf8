 A STAFF REPORTER

 With a sizeable chunk of students from India going abroad to pursue higher studies, Australia has come calling for students from this part of the country.

 On Wednesday, Perth Education City, a body funded by the industries and the government of Western Australia, organised an education seminar in the city to showcase the benefits of studying Down Under.

 We want to spread awareness about Perth as a destination for Indian students, said Jamal Qureshi, South Asia regional marketing manager, Perth Education City.

 The daylong event started off with a seminar on education structure in Western Australia, followed by one-to-one meetings with university representatives. 

 Most students were interested in programmes on business management, biotechnology, information technology and international business.

 Western Australia has a booming economy This provides students job opportunities not only after the completion of the courses, but also part-time jobs while they are studying, added Qureshi.

 According to him, the cost of enrolling in an undergraduate diploma course (two years) is Rs 3.6 lakh per annum. For undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses, it is around Rs 7.2 lakh per annum.

 The participating universities include Curtin University of Technology, Edith Cowan University, Murdoch University, University of Western Australia, Perth Institute of Business and Technology (PIBT) and the Guilford Grammar School.

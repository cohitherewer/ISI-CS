The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Worlds most sensitive city

 Martin Waelde, the outgoing director of Max Mueller Bhavan, thinks City of Joy is a romantic Western tag. He would rather discuss Calcuttas strengths, says Subhro Saha

 He has problems with Calcuttas City of Joy image, a romantic Western concept that doesnt do justice to the worlds safest and most sensitive megapolis. He would rather take away with him notions of the amazing physical and mental strength of the people of Calcutta, where poverty has the most human face possible.

 As he counts out the last days of his stint in the city and packs his suitcases for next stop Warsaw, Martin Waelde, the outgoing director of Max Mueller Bhavan, can look back with a sense of fulfilment at the four-year experience.

 Calcutta is a huge, complex laboratory of social life, architecture, arts, history, economy and politics. Here the poor have more chance of surviving in the heart of the city and not get dislocated as in most other Indian cities, he says.

 A shutterbug fascinated by people, he has captured countless interesting portraits on his Nikon D200. It zoomed in on the flower market at six in the morning, the riverside rituals, the laughing club in Gariahat, or the old palaces of north Calcutta

 Two of the most painful events for me were the restructuring and downsizing of the institute and the closing down of the library, he recalls. Things are expected to change though, since India is now the focal region for Goethe-Institut and secretary-general Hans Georg Knopp is an India expert. The budget allocation will increase, which will obviously have an impact on Calcutta and the library should be back by this year-end, once his successor Reimar Volker settles in, Waelde promises.

 When I arrived in March 2003, we had commissioned a study aimed at repositioning Max Mueller Bhavan. We needed new faces, and it was difficult, given the wide array of seductive entertainment options available, he points out.

 However, with events like the exhibition of prints of Georg Baselitz, Pina Bauschs Tanztheater Wuppertal and the photographic documentation of heritage buildings in north Calcutta by Peter Bialobrzeski and his students from the College of Arts, Bremen, Max Mueller Bhavan has managed to attract youngsters.

 There are regrets. I feel we havent done enough for children during my tenure and maybe we could have worked on a long-term project on environment education. I could have explored more opportunities in music and picked up some Bengali

 Another area that needs a prop-up is the language courses, feels Waelde, since Calcutta continues to be a laggard and Delhis turnover is five to six times more. There has been a 30-40 per cent increase in demand in the past few years, but thats mostly call centre-driven. Individual students are more important than corporate batches, Waelde says.

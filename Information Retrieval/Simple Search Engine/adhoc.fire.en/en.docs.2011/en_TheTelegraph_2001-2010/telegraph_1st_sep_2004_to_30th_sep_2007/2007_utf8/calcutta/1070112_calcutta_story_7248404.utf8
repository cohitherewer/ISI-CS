 Science City: Role model. A Telegraph picture

 The syllabus: science made simple. The classroom: Calcutta. Following in the footsteps of American, Australian and Chinese experts, Finnish science communicators have come calling at the city headquarters of National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) for tips to upgrade their science park.

 The purpose of the park is to teach basic science principles in an appealing way to people of all ages. The NCSM has gained expertise in developing science exhibits using very simple techniques. We have decided to work jointly with the organisation to generate better ideas for our science park, said Mikko Myllykoski, leader of the team and experience director, Heureka Science Centre, Finland.

 For example, elaborated Myllykoski after a session at Science City with NCSM experts, Heureka will have exhibits demonstrating the science behind the sweet notes of the jaltarang to illustrate the relationship between sound pitch and the height of water in a bowl.

 Our indoor science museums are highly advanced and there is no dearth of hi-tech equipment. But the exhibits displayed in science parks have to be different from the ones kept in museums and must be designed in such a way that everyone can understand the underlying principle. We are keen on adopting the NCSM concepts in this field, clarified the Finnish team leader.

 There are 27 NCSM science centres in the country, including Science City.

 According to officials, the Finnish team is the latest from abroad to evince an interest in collaborating with NCSM. Experts from the US were first in line, followed by their counterparts in Australia and China.

 A park like Science City is an interactive hub, where an element of fun is interwoven into the learning of science. The visitors get an opportunity to test scientific principles first hand, said NCSM director-general Ingit Mukherjee.

 Learning as fun is what the foreign teams are keen to adopt. The concept of a park for learning science was pioneered by NCSM in the country. We opened our Mumbai centre back in 1979. Even the Americans have adopted our concept, stressed an official.

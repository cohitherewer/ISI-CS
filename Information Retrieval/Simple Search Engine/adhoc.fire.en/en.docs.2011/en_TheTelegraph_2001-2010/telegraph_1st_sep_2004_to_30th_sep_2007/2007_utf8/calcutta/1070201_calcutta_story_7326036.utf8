 After Lake police station, its the turn of Beniapukur thana to host a school for street children on its premises. And the credit for both goes to officer-in-charge Anil Jana, serving Beniapukur after Lake.

 The school in Beniapukur to be run by NGO Vikramshila Education Resource Society is being built for over two months. Spread over 550 sq ft, the single-storeyed structure will accommodate around 80 children.

 Vikramshila will shift to Beniapukur the students of Debendra Vidyapith, which it used to run in Linton Street but had to close down, said Sutapa Chakraborty, coordinator of the organisation.

 The area behind the police station had been lying unused. I thought of putting it to some good use and came up with the idea of constructing a school, said Jana.

 He discussed the idea with four of his friends and they readily agreed to help him in his mission. They are as determined as me to see the project through, Jana added.

 Commenting on his subordinates philanthropic zeal, deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) Partha Sarathi Ghosh said: All of us must remember that its not enough to become just good cops. We should also be good human beings. Its heartening to see that our men are dedicating themselves to social work.

 The school is likely to be inaugurated towards February- end by police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

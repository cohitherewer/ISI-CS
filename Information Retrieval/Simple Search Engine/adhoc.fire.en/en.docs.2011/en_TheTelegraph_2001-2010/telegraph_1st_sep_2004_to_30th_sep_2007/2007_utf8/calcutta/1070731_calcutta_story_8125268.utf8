 Tribute to a trailblazer

 An artist who perennially drew on the delicate nuances of relationships and multitudinous aspects of life, Gobardhan Ash commanded immense variety in the style and substance in his work of art. Though human figures remained his core subject throughout his life, he never got stuck into a predictable stylistic groove. What he aspired to create was a reality of coherent and vital images with expressive lines, shapes and forms. He stripped bare the harsh reality of life in portraying the life of the people of rural Bengal. Moved by the plight of the people during the Bengal famine, he created a captivating series of works on it, using gouache as a medium. Commemorating his birth centenary, the ongoing exhibition featuring works by the legendary master painter also pays a fitting tribute to his invaluable contribution to the world of Indian contemporary art.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Gobardhan Ash When: Till August 5; 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Aakriti Art Gallery, 12/3A Hungerford Street, 1st floor

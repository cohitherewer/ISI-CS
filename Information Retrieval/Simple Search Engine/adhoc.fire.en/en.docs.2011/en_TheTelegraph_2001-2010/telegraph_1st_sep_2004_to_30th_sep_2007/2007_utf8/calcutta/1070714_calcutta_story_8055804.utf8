 An eight-ft-long raised strip of tram track pierced through the undercarriage of an Alto on Lenin Sarani on Thursday evening. The driver was not hurt but the incident brought back memories of May 2003, when a metal strip impaled Amit Dalmiya in his car and killed him. 

 More such incidents are waiting to occur across the city. At the Rashbehari crossing, the concrete below and around the tram tracks has eroded long ago. Motorist Soumen Ghosh, 34, shudders at the prospect of a mishap. I am not safe even when I am in my car, he says.

 On Charu Avenue, in front of the Rabindra Sarobar Metro station, a pointed metal strip juts out precariously. Motorcyclists and cyclists are the most vulnerable, as two-wheelers can easily skid on the metal. 

 The tram tracks on the Sealdah flyover are worse. They protrude at various spots, posing a threat to both motorists and pedestrians. Two-wheelers often skid and fall, says a sergeant on duty.

 Between the Shyambazar five-point crossing and RG Kar hospital, a part of a tram track points upwards and remains suspended in mid-air. Drivers coming from the opposite direction can meet with a mishap anytime.

 It is not possible to repair all the tram tracks at the same time. Our engineers will check the state of the tracks, says the HRBC chairman, Swadesh Ranjan Chakravarty.

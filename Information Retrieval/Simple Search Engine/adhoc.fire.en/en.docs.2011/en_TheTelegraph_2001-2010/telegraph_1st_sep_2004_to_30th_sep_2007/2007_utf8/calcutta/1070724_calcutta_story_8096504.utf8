 She removed her slippers and closed her eyes. The high levels of concentration were evident on her face. She wasnt giving a shot. She was spiritually healing a room full of women.

 Doors in Consciousness: The Enlightenment of Man, an interactive event organised by The Ladies Study Group at Taj Bengal on Monday afternoon, saw the emergence of a new Manisha Koirala. The actress, who had once scorched the silver screen with films like Bombay and Dil Se, has moved on.

 I have always been a seeker, trying to find a meaning to life beyond all the glitter and the glamour, she told Metro. I have a friend who has been on a spiritual journey for more than 25 years. He introduced me to the Oneness University experience. And although I havent finished my whole course, it has changed my life completely. More than anything else, I am at peace and I am much happier now than I was before.

 Besides sharing her experience with members of the Ladies Study Group, who listened to Manishaspeak in rapt attention, the actress joined forces with Swami Namann of the Oneness University to conduct diksha the process of imparting energy through chanting to those present.

 It is about opening up the unconscious that dictates our action much more than the conscious; it revolves around the fact that there is just one mind, explained Swami Namann. We have had more than 160 million people benefitting from the Oneness experience across the world, including some very big names.

 Just because one explores spirituality does not mean that you have to give up the world or anything like that. I try to balance both the worlds, added Manisha, who was in Calcutta a few months back to shoot with Prosenjit for Rituparno Ghoshs Bengali film Khela. 

 The actress has been so moved by the Oneness experience that it is now even dictating her choice of films. I have just finished shooting for Sirf, which is about different classes of people reacting to material wealth in different ways. Yes, you can say that I did the film because I believed the content had spirituality in its heart.

 Police on hawker rein beat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police have been assigned the task of enforcing the civic bodys hawking rule, that allows vendors to occupy only one-third of the pavement and prevents them from selling their wares within 50 ft of major crossings.

 The drive will start from Saturday and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will provide all logistic support, including vehicles and payloaders, to the raiding teams.

 All police stations in the city have been alerted about their responsibility. We will intervene if there is any violation of the rule. We will also take action against shopkeepers who are stacking wares on the pavements, said police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 The decision to entrust the cops with enforcing the hawking rule was taken at a meeting between Mukherjee and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Tuesday evening.

 The deputy commissioners of 10 divisions of the city police attended the meeting at Lalbazar.

 A list of 43 intersections of 18 roads from BT Road to Rashbehari Avenue has

 been drawn for the vigil . Nine major roads and 27

 crossings in the Burrabazar-Sealdah-Park Street-Beadon

 Street belt have been identified for immediate action.

 Welcoming the move, general secretary of the Hawker Sangram Committee Shaktiman Ghosh said: The police and the civic body are free to take action against hawkers found violating the rule. No trade union leader will oppose the drive.

 He, however, blamed the police for the situation. It is the cops who take money and allow hawkers to sit on roads.

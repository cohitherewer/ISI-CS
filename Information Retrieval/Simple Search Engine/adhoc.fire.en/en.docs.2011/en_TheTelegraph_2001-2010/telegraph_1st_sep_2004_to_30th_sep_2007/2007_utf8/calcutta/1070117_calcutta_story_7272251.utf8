 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Given a chance to play cricket in the United States, would you shift? Moments after posting a Ranji Trophy ton at Eden Gardens, Sourav Ganguly was facing the question from a team of American television crew in front of the camera.

 If David Beckham can quit Europe and sign up for a Los Angeles soccer team, why not Sourav? But then, the selection committee meeting for the One-Day International squad had started in Rajkot and the man of the moment was waiting for a call-up to Team India after 16 months. Under the circumstances, Sourav broke into a laugh, both embarrassed and incredulous. No, never, he said.

 The team, from Craterlion Productions in California, was in Calcutta to shoot a documentary on hand-pulled rickshaws but could not ignore the photo-opportunity that cricket at Eden offered on Friday.

 Introduce him as the prince of Calcutta, a local suggested to the anchor, Jim Brochure (in picture above with Sourav, by Santosh Ghosh). The feed, after all, was meant exclusively for the viewers of Discovery Travel amp; Living in the Americas where a bat is what baseball is played with. So, Sourav Ganguly was likely to be a discovery.

 Brochure braved on, furiously consulting his notes, asking Sourav about his chances of playing in the World Cup. As he started to answer, the Californian youth unsuspectingly added two words. As captain? Sourav changed his shot and quickly shifted on to the back foot.

 The last question was reserved for rickshaws and their phase-out, where again the former skipper was diplomacy personified, expressing confidence that the state government would do the right thing.

 Before meeting Sourav, the crew, including US-based city boy Sashi De, was soaking in the sun from the sidelines. We are picking on different occupations for a series called Live the Life, said Ron Ambrose, the cameraman, adding that they would be travelling to Puri the day after to film deep sea fishermen. We also want to work on farmers of the Sunderbans and the shepherds of the Himalayas. I have been in the mountains and met them on my own.

 The cricket pitch was unfamiliar territory. Brochure had heard of Imran Khan, but given a choice between the two sports, he would choose soccer any day. I like more physical stuff. And all these hours here have left me more muddled about cricket, he admitted.

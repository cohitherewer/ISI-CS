 A study of rights

 - 60 schools adopt three-module course

 NABAMITA MITRA

 All have the right to live in peace without being involved in violence: Asian People Human Rights Document, 1998.

 Only a handful of students the future citizens are aware of the inalienable right of human beings, as enshrined in the document.

 To spread awareness on the subject, human rights has been included in the curriculum of a few private schools in the city including Loreto Day School (Sealdah), Don Bosco (Park Circus) and St Xaviers. It is also being taught informally in a host of government schools in Calcutta and some of its adjacent districts.

 The course is being introduced in association with the Institute of Human Rights Education (IHRE) Programme Peoples Watch, a Tamil Nadu-based organisation. It has the sanction of the UN high commissioner for human rights education and the Unicef.

 The course is divided into three modules, to be taught in classes VI, VII and VIII. It has been introduced in 10 states, including Bengal, said Christine Gupta, a member of the resource team that is training teachers from various schools in human rights. 

 The three modules basic human rights, child rights and discrimination (based on caste, religion, race, language or gender) have been adopted with respect to the social condition of each state.

 Till now, 35 government and 25 private schools have implemented the programme. With help from the district inspectors of schools, the course has been introduced in North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly.

 The response from the schools in North 24-Parganas has been very encouraging, said Amal Krishna Mondal, an inspector of schools in the district.

 Nilanjan Saha, a teacher in Hindu School, said: We are making the students aware of the basic human rights. We cannot implement the curriculum without the governments consent.

 He was among the two teachers from the school who had turned up at the five-day training session, attended by 105 teachers from 59 schools.

 Around 10,000 books on human rights have been distributed in Bengali and English-medium schools. Loreto Sealdah is taking the initiative to translate the books from English to Bengali. The cost is being borne by IHRE, said Sister Cyril, principal, Loreto Day School, Sealdah. 

 Seeing the reaction of student activists to the Nandigram incident, I strongly felt human rights should be part of the curriculum, said Sister Cyril.

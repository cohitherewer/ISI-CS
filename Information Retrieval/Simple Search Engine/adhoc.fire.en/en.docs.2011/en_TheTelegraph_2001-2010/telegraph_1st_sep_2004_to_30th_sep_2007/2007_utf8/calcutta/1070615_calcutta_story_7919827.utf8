 I dont think signing a mere bond can solve such a big social problem. Legal documents or agreements can be considered. But above all, children should understand that their parents need them. Rather than signing bonds and promising monetary assurance, the younger generation should change their attitude towards their parents.

 Sandip Mukherjee, 

 Bandel, Howrah

 It is totally a humanitarian matter and depends on how children feel for their parents. We cannot force children to sign bonds and make them commit that they would love us and take care of us. Children and parents should reach some adjustments for a peaceful life.

 Pritha Gupta, 

 Paikpara Row

 Parent-children relationship is not a business deal. Signing a bond may widen the gap between parents and children. The unconditional love of parents should make children realise their responsibilities. If taking care of their parents is force upon them it may result in bitter feelings. 

 Nidhi Poddar,

 Salt Lake 

 Children nowadays are self-centred and some norms are not a bad idea. But signing a bond will burden them further. You cannot force someone to take care of his/her parents. That has to come from within. I cannot impose my responsibilities on someone who is not willing to take it on. Children should realise what their duties are. If they dont, parents should remove them from the centre of their lives and lead their life independently.

 Subhankar Mandal, 

 Palta

 It will be a disrespectful move on the part of parents. You cannot make someone love you by force. Life is no contract that you make someone sign it and get security and love in return. Children should realise parents are no burden. And it pays to remember that history repeats itself across generations. 

 Debjani Sen,

 Salt Lake

 Signing of a bond cannot guarantee that your children will take care of you in future. Parents should do their duty without expecting favourable returns from their wards.

 Somdutta Ganguly,

 Pittsburg

 Signing a bond with teenaged kids is no solution and is rather funny. You cannot buy love and care. Instead, parents should try to illustrate the significance of family life by setting examples themselves. They should also make their wards realise the importance of their presence in their lives.

 Tapan Pal,

 Batanagar

 Bringing up a child is not a long-term investment. Similarly, parents are not a liability. Parents should bring up their children without any expectations. Signing bonds is a bad idea. I would not have gone for it.

 Anil Kumar Sen,

 All of us need such a bond for a secure old age. Children nowadays leave their parents in old age homes and forget them. They think their responsibility ends there. But they should realise that their parents need their company in their last days. 

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 For old age security and a peaceful life, I would definitely go for such a bond. Nowadays, children just dont care for their old parents. Then why should their parents spend their hard-earned money to bring them up? 

 Rathin Chatterjee,

 Dum Dum

 Parents today are helpless. They take all the pains in life to bring up the children only to see their children disown them or refuse to look after them in their old age. In such a situation, signing a bond is a clever idea.

 Dinabandhu Mukherji, 

 Behala

 Such bonds make no sense. You cannot make a person love his/her parents and take care of them. If children ignore their parents, they should move court or save money for their old age instead of spending it all on their childrens upbringing.

 Subrata Das, 

 Tollygunge

 It is a very good idea. Just like the insurance papers we sign or the money we save for the future, such bonds would ensure our security in old age. This is the perfect answer to children who can be selfish enough to forget their parents. Parents should not hesitate in drawing up such bonds.

 Probal Sen, 

 Chetla

 Care is not born out of a guarantee. It is rather a part of a mutual understanding that parents should try to encourage in their children, without ever spelling it out. Contracts, if made, can always be broken. But deep affection and mutual understanding always survive the ravages of time. 

 Sourish Mishra,

 Salt Lake

 Signing a bond is a good idea. Life is very unpredictable and we should take steps to secure our future. It is very unfortunate that children forget their parents, when they need them the most. If the children can be mean, why cant the parents make them sign a bond?

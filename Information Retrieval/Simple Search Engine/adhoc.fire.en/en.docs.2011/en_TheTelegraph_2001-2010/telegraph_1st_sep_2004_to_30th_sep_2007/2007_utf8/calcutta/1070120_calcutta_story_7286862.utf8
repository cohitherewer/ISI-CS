The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 One-act woman

 Way back in the 1960s, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown had acted in a school production of Romeo and Juliet, directed by her British teacher Miss Mann, in Uganda. At a time when white actors blackened up to play Othello, Yasmin the Uganda-born Shia Muslim of Indian origin played Juliet, John an African Christian played Romeo and Yasmins India-born Hindu boyfriend Tybalt.

 The casting was more volatile than any of them realised and the play triggered events that not only reflected the social sentiments of the time but also changed her life forever. It severed Yasmins relationship with her family (for kissing a black man) and made her understand the deeper tensions within her, between love and racism. It also snapped her links with the stage she loved.

 Nowhere to Belong marks Yasmins return to her first love, theatre. The 30th show of a sort of mishmash one-act play hosted by British Council in collaboration with Indian Council for Cultural Relations at Uma on Sarat Bose Road last Saturday (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya) recreates that defining moment in her life.

 Known as one of the foremost political journalists and writers in the UK, Yasmin was a victim of Idi Amins expulsion of Ugandan Asians in 1972. But she also remembered that a 1,000-strong all-white audience in England had been moved by her performance and allowed her to take digs at the whites of East-Africa. The solo performance at Uma, aided by recorded dialogues, music and a few props effectively recreates the build-up of racial tension.

 Nowhere to Belong was commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Society and Yasmin, a Oxford University alumnus with several books to her credit still cant get over her love for Shakespeare whose plays she feels carry more meaning for the coloured minorities and immigrants everywhere. Nowhere... is slated to tour four other countries and even come out in book form.

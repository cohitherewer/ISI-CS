 Custody for clinic owner

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Renuka Sharma, the arrested owner of Everest Nursing Home, from where several babies were allegedly sold, was produced in court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody for seven days.

 Her husband Babu, the other owner of the nursing home, is absconding.

 We will interrogate Renuka to find out more about the baby-sale racket, said Supratim Sarkar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 The primary objective is to identify the woman who had delivered the three-day-old girl child that a female attendant was smuggling out of the nursing home last Friday. The officers are also looking for the person who had booked the baby.

 On an average, two deliveries and abortions would be performed at the nursing home each month, of which no record would be kept. Many of the babies would die. There were also deliveries whose records were kept, said an investigating officer. 

 Apart from a trade licence issued by the South Dum Dum Municipality, the nursing home officials have failed to produce any paper required to run such a facility. The police said that it did not have the infrastructure to conduct even the most basic surgery.

 According to the investigators, the nursing home used to issue advertisements promising babies to childless couples. The three female attendants we have interrogated said they were threatened with dire consequences if they spoke about the nursing homes affairs, added the officer.

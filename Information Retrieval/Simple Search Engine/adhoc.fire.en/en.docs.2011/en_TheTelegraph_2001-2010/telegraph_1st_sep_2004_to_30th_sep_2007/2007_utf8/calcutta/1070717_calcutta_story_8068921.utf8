 Bali Island in the Sunderbans is a five- hour journey from Calcutta. As part of Forestry Week, school students from the city, all members of Kids for Tigers, a programme of wildlife magazine Sanctuary Asia, visited the island on July 15. 

 The members were there to spread awareness about conserving tigers in the island, one of 102 in the Sunderbans. A team of 20 went along with students and teachers of two city schools. 

 We launched our campaign, Save the Bengal Tiger on the day, informed Joydip Kundu, a Calcutta correspondent for the magazine. 

 More than 1,500 students from 15 schools on the island were also involved in the days programme. Most children here have seen tigers, said Kundu. 

 It was an interactive programme where the young tiger ambassadors from Calcutta shared their views with local children. I was surprised to see that the schools have well-functioning nature clubs. They are quite aware of how dependent their livelihood is on ecology, said Uma Rajan, the nature club in-charge at Birla High School for Boys, junior section. The club has been working with Sanctuary Asias programme for the last six years. 

 This is the first time we went to the Sundarbans for such a programme. If we save tigers, we save the forest and the ecology. That was the objective of the interactive session, said Tapti Dasgupta, the coordinator of the science club of La Martiniere for Girls, one of the two schools that went to the Bali Island.

 Debattama Das Sharma, a Class XI student of La Martiniere for Girls, was excited to know that one of the teachers in the area had touched a chloroformed tiger. 

 The students here had so much to share. Students of these schools are aware of the biodiversity and the problems we are facing, she said. 

 Programmes to spread awareness on tiger conservation were also organised. Students of local schools presented their views on placards they displayed on a road march. This was followed by a sapling-plantation ceremony. 

 The students from Calcutta presented slideshows on tiger preservation and the biodiversity of India. 

 With the help of seniors, we had put together slideshows on everything about the tigers from their birth. 

 I would love to go back to the forests to work on the Kids for Tigers project, said Srijan Basu Mullick, a Class IV student of Birla High School for Boys. 

 Sanctuary is planning to take more students from Calcutta schools to the Sunderbans. We will also bring students from other islands in the delta region in phases, signed off Kundu.

 Spreading wings

 Elaan, an NGO, works on issues of child sexual abuse and incest. It functioned as a youth group before being registered as an NGO in June this year. Founded in 2004, it celebrated its third anniversary on July 14 by launching its official website, www.elaan.org. The event took place at Seagull Bookstore.

 The evening began with a video on child sexual abuse (CSA) victims followed by a brief introduction of the NGO and its objectives. A slideshow presentation was organised on subjects including the problems faced by homosexuals and transgendered people, specific aspects of CSA like accommodation syndrome, its aftermath and the healing procedures of CSA. It also demonstrated myths and facts, Elaans law against CSA campaign. 

 Parents, professors, students and members of the homosexual and transgender were present for the programme.

 Through this event, Elaan wants to spread awareness about the prevalence of child sexual abuse and incest.

 Shout out loud

 Whats on your mind this week

 Ever on the tech radar

 With technology

 having made its way into every aspect

 of our lives, its difficult now to spend a harmless day at home, to leave that creepy friend out of your party, to miss parties given by creepy friends, or simply, to lie. There are too many tracks to cover. The cell phone has to be switched off and all electronic correspondence has to be given a miss for the day. You cannot be caught making inane conversation with friends on Orkut or be visible on the messenger list. The generation that has witnessed every technological boom there is, is also its victim. And sometimes, unwillingly. We love our mean little cellphones, can spend all day SMS-ing and playing with it. We are just situated on the other side of the horizon. We are the children of the flip side, lets say. We want to spend every waking minute scrapping, being scrapped or checking who is scrapping whom or getting scrapped. And we do that when we have feigned sickness to miss a day at work or college. But the whole world is out there now, from the boss to the snoopy colleague.

 Then, there are the strangers. They would send you an e-message (on mail or messenger or Orkut) asking you whether you wanted to make friendship with them. You tell them to bugger off but they are back the next instant telling you why you should give them a chance to show what a good friend they can be. They try to advise your exasperated self that you are there to make friends and why you should not turn down this excellent opportunity to be their friend. You push the ignore button, but you are alarmed at the similar way these strangers behave, from butt-pinching on railway platforms to pursuing women on the Net. Online democracy is clearly not yet for us. 

 Social networking sites are great places hang out in. Cell phones are great things to own. But with both, your movements are always under the scanner. Moms are harder to dupe. They have your cell phone number as well as your friends. The butt-pinchers, of course, are there on Orkut or Facebook. We are sentimental about technology except when we want to lie. We like it except when it ends up making us honest. Children of the flip side, arent we?

 Douse the flames

 Accidental

 fire outbreaks can claim lives,

 and every home and institution should

 be well equipped to douse fire.

 The recent fire outbreak in a city

 hospital, claiming two lives, is

 a case in point. 

 Many institutions in the city are not properly equipped to fight fire. In order to avoid such mishaps, certain measures need to be taken. Cooking gas cylinders should be safely stored in a relatively isolated place. Fire extinguishers should be installed at regular intervals and the expiry dates should be checked from time to time. The staff must also be trained to use fire extinguishers. There should also be adequate emergency fire exits and alarm systems. Rooms should have proper ventilation. Be it a hospital, a school or a site of interest, fire prevention is a must to ensure safety and avoid casualties.

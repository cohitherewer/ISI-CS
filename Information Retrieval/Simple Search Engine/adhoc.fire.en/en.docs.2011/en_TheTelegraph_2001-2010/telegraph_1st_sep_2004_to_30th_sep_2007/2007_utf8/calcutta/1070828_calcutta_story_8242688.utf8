 A noble sacrifice

 Hosted by EZCC as its theatre show of the month is Gopa (a scene from the play appears right), a play that narrates the story of its eponymous protagonist, Gopa, wife of Siddhartha of Kapilavastu, the prince of the Shakyas. Renouncing princely life after attaining enlightenment, Siddhartha Gautama became Lord Buddha, leaving his wife all alone with his infant son. Written by Arun Sinha, the play focuses on the young wifes courage, patience, calmness, strength, fortitude and various other qualities of head and heart, at a time when she feels all but abandoned by her husband. Later, she too embraces the religious path chosen by The Buddha and becomes a bhikshuni, a mere helpless, beggar begging for alms for survival. Forsaking a life of ease and luxury, she becomes an ascetic by choice, leading a life of frugality and austerity. Finally, she allows her son Rahul to become his fathers disciple. Direction: Suman Kumar.

 Event: Play in Hindi, Gopa, produced by Kala Jagran, Patna When: Today at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

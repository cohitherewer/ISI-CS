 Missing boy walks home

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A four-year-old boy, lured away from his Gas Street home by someone known to him, returned a few hours later on Wednesday.

 According to police, Mohammad Sarad Sohrab was playing near his house when someone took him away by promising a motorcycle ride. He walked home after around five hours. His mother and his uncle received a call demanding Rs 5 lakh ransom in the intervening period.

 The police arrested a 24-year-old local resident in connection with the kidnapping. The boys father, who works in the merchant navy, denied paying a ransom, but the neighbours believe otherwise. 

 Sohrabs mother raised an alarm after she could not find him around the house. The family members, along with neighbours, immediately started looking for the child.

 Mohammad Asif, alias Saheb, had picked up the boy and made the ransom calls. He was feigning ignorance but later confessed. We have arrested him, said deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) Partha Sarathi Ghosh.

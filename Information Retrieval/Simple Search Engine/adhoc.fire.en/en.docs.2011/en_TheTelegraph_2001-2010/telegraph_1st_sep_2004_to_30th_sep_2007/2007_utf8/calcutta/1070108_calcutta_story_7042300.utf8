 Its a return to childhood as smiling Disney characters and cuddly teddy bears greet you at the new Lee Road kids address. Over two levels and 3,500 sq ft, new-entrant All4kids has received a warm response from children and parents in town.

 Our aim is to develop a chain of kids stores and fortunately there are no other players in this category, says Manish Saraf.

 Manish is the managing director of Esbee Exim Pvt Ltd, the company that has set up a chain of toy shops and kid stores across the country. While the outlets stocking toys and games are called Toy Story, stores offering a wider range of baby and kids gear along with playthings are called All4kids.

 Our customer loyalty programme ensures that our customers stay happy, says Saraf. Under the Toy Story VIP Club, purchases are converted into points that may be redeemed for gifts. Parents can also host kids birthday parties here.

 Toy treat

 An unbeatable selection of toys and games decks the shelves on the ground level. There are interactive toys that teach children basic skills and help develop imagination. Then there are childrens games that teach math, colours, hand-eye co-ordination and how to use a computer.

 In fun toys for both boys and girls, there are skateboards, dolls, sing-along cassette recorders, Barbie collections, play make-up sets, Lego blocks, hot wheels, music organs, board games and more. The collection also spans every conceivable cartoon/comic character Winnie The Pooh, Mickey Mouse, Noddy, Donald Duck, Simba, Tom and Jerry...

 The recent craze of Dhoom:2 has sparked an interest in our heavy-duty motor range. Some of the racing cars can accelerate to 30 km an hour, says Manish.

 The ride-ons include racing cars, golf carts, bikes and Disney cycles that are priced between Rs 5,000 and Rs 17,000. 

 The shop also houses tech-toys like remote-controlled cars, robots, battery-operated guns, spy cameras and gaming console Xbox 360.

 An interesting section is the Shut-up toy range that begins at Rs 19. As the name suggests, it consists of games that divert the childrens attention and, more importantly, keep them quiet for quite a while!

 Wardrobe pick

 Apart from games and toys, there are furnishings, decorations, apparel and footwear. 

 Tiny vests, booties, winter jackets, frilly dresses, party frocks, nightclothes and dungarees find a place all splashed with cartoon prints and colour aplenty.

 Footwear for kids up to five years comprises sandals, slippers, sneakers and even formal wear. They are priced between Rs 150 and Rs 695. 

 Add-ons

 If your little one is scared of the dark, there are florescent cushions that glow at night and soft bunnies to cuddle when dozing off. Even bolsters take the shape of penguins and farm animals.

 Birthday accessories like masks, banners, paper plates, bags for return gifts and decorations are also available under the same roof.

 In stationery, theres everything a school-going child would need pens, notebooks, files, calculators, erasers, pencils and sharpeners.

 New needs

 All4kids also has an adorable range of newborn needs on the first floor. Its a one-stop shop, where a mother-to-be or mother of an infant can shop at a leisurely pace, says Archana, Manishs wife, who looks after the store.

 On offer are blanket sets with cartoon prints from brands like Disney and Enfant a perfect buy to keep your baby warm in these winter months.

 Add to this a comfortable range of prams, cots and baby walkers. The largest cot is three-feet long complete with net coil as protection. The pick of the lot is an automatic rocking pram with a device for regulating the speed. It comes for Rs 5,000. 

 Besides, you will find branded cosmetics for your baby and young child like Johnson amp; Johnson, Tolly Joy, Mothercare and Farlin. 

 Accessories include disposable diapers, bibs, nappies that are kind to sensitive skin, carry baskets, ear-buds and electrical steam sterilises for feeding bottles. The management is considering the inclusion of baby food to the range in the near future.

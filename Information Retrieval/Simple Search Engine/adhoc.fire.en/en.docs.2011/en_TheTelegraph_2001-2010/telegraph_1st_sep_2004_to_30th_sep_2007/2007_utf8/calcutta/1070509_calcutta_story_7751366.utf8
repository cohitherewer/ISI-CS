 Autos for rickshaws

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The state government has decided to rehabilitate rickshaw-pullers by providing them non-polluting autorickshaws.

 This came to light on Tuesday during the hearing of a case on the phase-out of hand-pulled rickshaws in the high court.

 Junior standing counsel of the state, Subroto Mukhopaddhaya, told Justice Dipankar Dutta: The government will provide non-polluting autos to the rickshaw-pullers. The vehicles will be purchased from a Pune-based company. The government is now making a list of rickshaw-pullers. The government has found that few rickshaw-pullers own the vehicles they ply, said the lawyer. 

 The pullers hire the rickshaws from the owners, who do not bother to obtain licences. So, the task of listing the names of rickshaw-pullers is quite difficult. The list will be ready soon.

 Mukhopaddhaya also told the court: At a time when the government is reluctant to stop plying of illegal and polluting autorickshaws, introduction of non-polluting vehicles should be welcomed. 

 In January, the government issued an administrative order directing the Calcutta Municipal Corporation not to renew the licences of hand-pulled rickshaws. 

 Two months ago, the same judge had passed an interim order asking the civic body to continue issuing licences till an amendment to the Calcutta Hackney Carriage Bill is made a law.

 The government lawyer challenged the validity of the interim order on Tuesday. He argued that the government had the right to issue an administrative order to stop renewal of licences.

 Justice Dutta asked for the administrative order to be placed before him on Thursday, the next date of hearing.

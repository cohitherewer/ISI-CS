 Paint to stay cool 

 - Research to prolong AC effect

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Jadavpur University has undertaken research to produce a paint that will help prolong the cooling effect of airconditioners (ACs).

 One feels cold inside a air-conditioned room because of the cool breeze released from the machine, said Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher of construction engineering and a member of the universitys executive committee. 

 But when the temperature outside is too high, the walls and roof of the room absorbs the excess heat, causing a rise in the room temperature. In such a situation, one feels a discomfort even when the AC is on, he explained.

 But the walls and the roof, if given a coat of the new paint, will not absorb the cool breeze. Instead, the paint will reflect the breeze towards the centre of the room. It will help in reducing electric consumption and increasing the longevity of ACs.

 The Indian Paint Research Centre and the Building Energy Group, both research bodies of the university, will carry out the research.

 Well be in a position to give the details about the cost of the paint once the research is complete. The university will try to involve paint manufacturers and work is likely to begin in a month, said Biswas.

 The university will also begin research on a low-cost paint, to be developed exclusively for houses made of mud and straw. 

 The paint will be durable for long and will be more resistant to rains and floods. Moreover, the paint will have a component which will make it resistant to cooking fuel used in rural areas, Biswas said.

 Officials of Indian Paint Association, an organisation of paint manufacturers, said they were aware of the research, but refused to comment.

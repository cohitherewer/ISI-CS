 Snap rap for power theft

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Power utility CESC will snap supply without notice and slap a stiff penalty to stop electricity theft. An amendment to the Electricity Act, that came into force on June 15, has empowered CESC to adopt stricter measures.

 We will now be able to check power theft better. We have instructed our vigilance wing to keep a strict watch on pilferage, said CESC director (corporate development) Santanu Chatterjee.

 Those found guilty of power theft will have to go without electricity for more than three months. For subsequent offences, supply could be cut off for two years. Supply to pilferers will be snapped without notice, added Chatterjee.

 The new measures incorporated in the act had been suggested by Bengal power supply agencies, said officials of CESC and the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited. Before the amendment, the act provided for imprisonment of up to five years for pilferers. That remains unchanged.

 Under the new provisions, those found guilty of pilferage will have to pay the cost of the electricity stolen. If the duration of theft cannot be proved, CESC will assume the period to be a year and the pilferer will have to pay a minimum of twice the cost of the stolen power.

 Earlier, domestic consumers had to pay twice the cost of the power stolen in three months and commercial consumers had to pay twice the cost of power stolen in six months.

 Those accused of pilfering power would also have to prove their innocence in court.

 Amar Goswami, a relative of an RSP leader, will be the first person in the city to be tried under the provisions of Electricity (Amendment) Act, 2007. He had allegedly stolen power from the supply line to his Bediapara factory, on the northern fringes.

 There are about 400 power theft cases in the CESC-served areas pending in court.

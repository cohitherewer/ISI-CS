 Plastic, sound amp; fire code

 A STAFF REPORTER

The state environment, fire services and police departments on Thursday spelt out the dos and donts for puja organisers.

 Environment minister Sailen Sarkar said the use of plastic bags has to be controlled. He, however, admitted that it is difficult to curb plastic menace during the Puja because of the rise in the number of small vendors.

 Sarkar said the puja organisers will have to use sound limiters and abide by the time limit 6am to 10pm for playing loudspeakers.

 Use of microphones in forest areas and bursting of crackers have been banned.

 Sarkar also stressed the need for removing the waste from the Hooghly within 24 hours of immersion to prevent water pollution.

 Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee said safety norms, including those related to the material used for constructing pandals, remain unaltered. 

 Fire-safety training for puja committee representatives will be held on October 11 and 12 at four places across the city, stated Chatterjee.

 He laid emphasis on keeping adequate exit and entrance space, so that people can be evacuated quickly during an emergency. 

 Utmost caution should be taken about the electric lines and source points, observed the minister.

 Citizens are, however, sceptical about the government measures.

 Few people will practise what the ministers are preaching. There is no point laying down norms now, when most pandals are half-ready, said a member of a panel that will judge city pujas.

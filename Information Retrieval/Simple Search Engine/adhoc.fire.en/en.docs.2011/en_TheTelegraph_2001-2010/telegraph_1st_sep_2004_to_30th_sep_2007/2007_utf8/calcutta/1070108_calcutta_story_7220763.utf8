The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Work on for new-look ward

 Subrata Dasgupta, CPM councillor of Calcutta Municipal Corporations ward number 103, met readers of The Telegraph and answered their queries. 

Participants included Tanusree Roy, Ruma Saha, Biren Gupta, Sumita Roy, Swapna Karmakar, Sandeep Banerjee, Subinoy Samaddar, Swadesh Karmakar, Goutam Neogi and Kaberi Ghosh

Subinoy Samaddar: In our area, roadside shops are gradually encroaching into the streets. At a few places, it is quite difficult for a vehicle to pass. Pedestrians have to struggle to cross the roads. What are you doing to control the illegal growth of roadside shops? 

 In order to prevent the illegal growth, we have decided to widen the roads by converting surface drains into underground drains. From now on, the roads will stretch till the boundary walls of buildings, on either side of the road. The road-widening work is on at Sukanta Road (between Sukanta Setu and Nilachal) and on Akali Kumar Majumdar Road till Subodh Park.

 Previously, we had made many appeals to the traders to remove their shops. Now, we will take strict action against them. Very soon, we will pull down these stalls. I can promise you that a lot of revamp work is on in our area to give it a new look. 

Swadesh Karmakar: There is a childrens park at West Road. A vat, just adjacent to the park, has become an eyesore for all of us. The garbage is not cleaned regularly. As a result, the rubbish decomposes and is unhealthy for the kids. How can you help us in getting rid of this vat?

 Just like you, I dont like open vats on the roads. This vat was previously located at Sandhyabazar. It was later relocated next to this park. I am scouting for a suitable spot to shift the vat, possibly on the banks of the drainage canal. I think such problems wouldnt have cropped up, if Kanti Gangulys proposed scheme of Bari te lorry was adopted by the civic conservancy department.

 Tanusree Roy: Purba Jadavpur Granthagar is a prestigious public library in this area. But it is now in a shambles. Most of the time, we find it closed. What is the problem? 

 I admit that due to poor upkeep, the library is in a shambles. The main reason is lack of funds. A fund of Rs 20 lakh is still lying unutilised. MP Sujan Chakraborty has agreed to extend help from his MPLAD fund. The borough committee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has also agreed to help us. 

 But there are many infrastructural problems. There is no power connection. The CESC has disconnected the line for non-payment of electric bills. 

 The library has been a victim of a long legal battle between two committees. A case is on between the old committee of the library and Santoshpur Vidyamandir.

 I have taken up a revamp scheme. The new library will be equipped with modern facilities, like CDs and computers. I have requested both the committees to settle their dispute outside the court for the greater interest of the people.

Sumita Roy: Why have you stopped the renovation and re-excavation work in Santoshpur Square? Have you dropped the beautification project?

 The 

 revamp work is very much on. Lighting arrangements are also 

 included in the scheme. The civic body is laying an underground 

 cable, so other works are now on hold. After its completion, 

 which is expected to be over by January 10, we will start 

 off with the second phase of beautification work in February. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is scheduled to open 

 it for the public in March. 

Shopkeepers and vegetable sellers at Santoshpurbazar have stopped using plastic bags. But the sellers at Sandhyabazar are still using plastic bags. Can you enforce a ban on the use of plastic bags in all the marketplaces?

 Sandhyabazar falls under ward number 104. However, since it is a crucial environmental issue, I will take up the matter with the ward committee at the next meeting. 

Swapna Karmakar: The road connecting Trikon Park and the main road is very narrow. Is there any scope for widening the road by demolishing the defunct pump room there? 

 Well, I can assure you that the 

 road will soon be reconstructed into a four-ft-wide road. 

 The water supply department of the CMC has already given 

 a nod for demolishing the pump room. There is a CESC transformer 

 in the room. I have written to the CESC to shift the transformer 

 elsewhere. The CESC has asked for Rs 1.5 lakh to shift it. 

 A local puja committee has damaged the railings of Trikon 

 park. The repair work will be taken up very soon.

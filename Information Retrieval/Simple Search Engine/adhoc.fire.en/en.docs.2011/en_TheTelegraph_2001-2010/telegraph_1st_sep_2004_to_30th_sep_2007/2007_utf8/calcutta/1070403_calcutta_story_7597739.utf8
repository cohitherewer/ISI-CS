The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court scan on foul air

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcuttas poison fumes came under the high court scanner on Monday, with a division bench asking the state government and its various departments to disclose the level of air pollution in the city.

 The bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh passed the order after admitting a petition by environment activist Subhas Dutta, who claimed that car emission had turned Calcutta into Indias most polluted city.

 The bench will take up the matter again after seven weeks, when the government and other respondents, including the transport and police departments, will have to state their policies on combating air pollution.

 Moving his petition on Monday, Dutta said: Pollution in the city has reached an alarming level. Thousands of people, mainly children, are being affected by various lungs diseases because of air pollution.

 Vehicles more than 15 years old and unlicensed autorickshaws, he pointed out, contribute most to vehicular pollution in the city. Moreover, the emission-testing system is quite inadequate here. 

 The division bench noted down Duttas submissions and asked the respondents to file affidavits.

 A fortnight ago, during the hearing of a petition by Dutta on vehicular pollution in the city at night, the high court had asked him why he had not mentioned pollution by day.

 Dutta submitted that the court had disposed of a case filed by him relating to auto emission by day in 2005.

 The division bench of Chief Justice Nijjar and Justice Ghosh then asked Dutta to file a fresh petition on day-time emission.

 Pollution caused by vehicular emission in 10 major cities, except Calcutta, is monitored by the Supreme Court or the high court concerned. 

 With the division bench accepting Duttas petition, Calcutta may lose that distinction.

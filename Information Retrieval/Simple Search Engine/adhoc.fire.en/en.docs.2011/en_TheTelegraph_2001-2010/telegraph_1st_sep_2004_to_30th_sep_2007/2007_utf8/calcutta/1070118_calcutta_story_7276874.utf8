 Randy Jackson doing a jig with American Idol co-judge Paula Abdul

 The biggest hits, the weirdest characters, the funniest goofs, the saddest tears and the loudest cheers are back on the small screen with the return of American Idol. Last season, almost 43 million fans tuned in to watch Taylor Hicks become the new American Idol. As he gets ready to shine on the big stage like Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and Fantasia, its time to find the next big star.

 If one man plays a big hand in picking the best of the lot, its judge Randy Jackson. And the man knows it. The show works because its the three of us (Randy along with co-judges Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell) on the panel and kind of what we do and how we interact, he says. I dont necessarily think that we need guest judges. When people come into the arena that we judge in, its often a little awkward and a little hard for them. 

 Its also been hard for Randy and company. We spend about two days in each city (in the US) and we generally see about 200 people a day, he says. Thats a lot of singing. A lot of being sung at. Fortunately for us, we are really 25-year-plus music industry veterans. Weve done every facet of it. Theres nothing we dont know about the music business. Being a musician myself and being on countless number of auditions when I was growing up, youre used to doing it. So I kind of know how to pace myself by this point.

 There is no change in what they are looking for. The qualities I look for is unbelievable, unique talent, and some sense of star potential, says Randy. That means some great personality, something thats going to engage people and also that confidence, that really eye-of-the-tiger kind of persistence. Elvis had all of that. If you think to whomever you love, whether its Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Prince or whomever, they all had all of those things. I think thats what makes up a great, great superstar.

 And will there be changes on the show format? Im going to come dressed like a Jedi every week like Gnarls Barclay, jokes Randy. We have a few things that we change, but I think the formula is pretty much what it is. I mean youll see a couple of wrinkles here and there, but, of course, I cant tell you what that is.

 But a certain Mariah Carey can land up on the show as a guest judge and go on to mentor the kids and sing on the show. Ive been thinking about it, admits Randy. Weve tossed it around a bit. I think shed be great because I think still, she, Whitney (Houston) and Celine (Dion) are those three big great divas, I mean some of the better singers of our time that weve ever known.

 So, get ready to be swept away by the next round of American Idol mania. It comes on STAR World, Wednesdays and Thursdays, at 8 pm.

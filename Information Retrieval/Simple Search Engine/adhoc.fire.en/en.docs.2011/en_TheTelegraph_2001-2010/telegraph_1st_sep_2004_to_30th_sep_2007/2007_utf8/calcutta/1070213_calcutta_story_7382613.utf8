 To motivate people to keep Calcutta clean, the civic body is producing a documentary called Eituku Kortei Hobe (This Much We Must Do). Directed by Rangan Chakraborty, the film features sweepers on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) payroll.

 The documentary will be screened shortly at Netaji Indoor Stadium or Citizens Park. It is part of a campaign conceived by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 The campaign will strive to persuade people to dump trash in a handcart or a vat by 7 am or keep it in a packet outside the front doors.

 Keeping the city clean now tops the CMCs agenda. Before trying to involve people in the campaign, we want to ensure participation of the civic conservancy workers and officers, said Bandyopadhyay.

 The conservancy department, house-owners, shop-owners, NGOs, councillors and ward committees all have active roles to play in keeping the city clean, the municipal commissioner observed.

 The process to involve them in the campaign started on Monday, when the first meeting of conservancy officials of block sarkar-level and above was held at Rabindra Sadan. The mayor, municipal commissioner and mayoral council member Chandana Ghosh Dastidar attended the meeting. 

 We have wasted enough time, energy and money in petty politics. It is time to explain to the young generation why the city is so dirty, said the mayor.

 The civic top brass feels it is impossible to keep the city clean with only 12,000 permanent sweepers on the CMC payroll and are thinking of employing private agencies to remove garbage in some pockets on an experimental basis.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Suniel ShettyYou are always full of enthusiasm 

 and out to do something new. You make jolly and entertaining 

 company. It is very difficult for you to make enemies. Travelling 

 is an important part of your life. Children love you naturally. 

 Absentmindedness may cause you losses.

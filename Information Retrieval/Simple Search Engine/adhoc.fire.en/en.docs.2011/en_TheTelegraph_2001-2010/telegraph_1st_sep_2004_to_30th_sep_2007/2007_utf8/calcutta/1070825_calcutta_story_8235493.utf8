The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Palm gallery on green patch

 - CITIZENS PARK WILL BE MINI BOTANICS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bengal Shelter Housing Development Ltd, which has taken over the maintenance of Citizens Park from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), plans to set up an exclusive palm gallery there, which will showcase exotic varieties of the plant collected from all over the world.

 We will also embark on a drive to collect rare species of plants for the park and will get prominent senior citizens to plant them, Samar Nag, the managing director of Bengal Shelter, told Metro.

 The company, which will spend around Rs 60 lakh a year to maintain the existing greenery and create a miniature botanical garden in the park, also plans to hold nature-study camps for schoolchildren.

 As part of the infrastructure industry, its our duty to create urban woods to tackle pollution and this is an effort to that end. We will run a nursery in the park and create points of interest by screening clippings of Bengali festivals, like Poush Mela, Nag added.

 By handing over the maintenance of the 11-acre park to a private firm, the CMC will save Rs 70 lakh annually, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Citizens Park came up in May 2005 as a collective effort of the army, city police and the CMC, at a cost of Rs 10 crore.

 Bengal Shelter also plans to turn the pavement in front of Academy of Fine Arts into an open-air exhibition-cum-sale gallery for budding artists.

 According to the agreement between the CMC and Bengal Shelter, no entry fee will be charged and the space cannot be let out for functions, said joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam.

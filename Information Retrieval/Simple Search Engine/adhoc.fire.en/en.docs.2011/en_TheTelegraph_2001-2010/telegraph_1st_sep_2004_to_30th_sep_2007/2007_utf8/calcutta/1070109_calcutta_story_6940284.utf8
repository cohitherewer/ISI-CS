 Restroom rules, direction-wise

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Feng Shui recommends having the toilet in the north-west of the house or in the north-west of individual rooms. The movements that rule this area help in a positive manner by moving out the polluted energy. It is also best to place the commode in the north-west of the toilet

Each and every direction of the house is associated with an important aspiration of our life. It is essential to have our toilets located in such places where their negative energy does not destroy the goodness of those particular directions. 

 The most important direction of the house is the north-east that is connected with pious energy of god. By no means can we have the toilets in the north-east as they mingle with pure energy and pollute the spiritual area. This spoils the physical and mental wellbeing of the residents. Feng Shui also prohibits us to have toilets in the north-east of each bedroom. 

 The next important area of the house is the south-west corner. The ruling earth energy of this place provides the residents with stability in life that gets disturbed by the unstable energies of the toilets. 

 The third important direction is the south-east, that is directly related with the wealth of the occupants. It is foolish to have a toilet in this area as it will not only prevent wealth from flowing in, but also become the cause of unnecessary financial drainage.

 The east is connected with the overall health of the residents. Having a toilet in the east means tampering with their health and incurring medical expenses. 

 The north is another important area of the house that is connected with ones business and career. The drainage system in the toilets here sucks away the water energy that rules the north. 

 The safest area for toilets would be in the north-west of the house or the north-west of each room. The movements that rule this area help in a positive manner by moving out the polluted energy of this area. It is best to place the commode in the north-west of every toilet. They should be located against the north wall of the north-west corner facing the south rather than being placed in the west of the north-west corner facing the east. This is because we all worship the rising sun and hence it is not advisable to use the commode facing east.

 If toilets and commodes are wrongly located, the best solution would be to install a large mirror on the toilet door from outside. At times, this solution does not seem to be feasible when there are young kids at home. It can then be substituted with a reflective sheet of metal, which can be placed as a mirror. You can also try placing a heavy boulder on the floor in the corner of the toilet to control the water energy being drained. 

 Ensure that the toilets are well ventilated and kept clean, dry and airy. Do not go overboard and decorate it with photographs of couples or children. Do not clutter or store tall bottles of toiletries on the shelves in front of the mirrors above the basin. This clutter stands between the person and his reflection and acts like a barrier on his potential. One should form the habit of keeping the commode cover closed when not in use. 

 The doors should also be kept shut. Another important thing to observe is the direction in which the doors open. They should never open into the bedroom as in this arrangement the entire negativity of the toilet flows into the room. Always check that the toilet doors are not facing the prayer room or the main entrance of the house. 

 It is not a good idea to choose a flat where the toilets do not have any kind of ventilation. These are termed as dead toilets where the negative energy gets accumulated and then circulates in the house since there is no other outlet. The negative energy disturbs and pollutes the positive energy that circulates in the house. This could directly have an adverse affect on the residents mental and physical wellbeing. 

 In Feng Shui, water is akin to wealth. Make sure that all the plumbing functions properly without any leakage and clogging. Pay immediate attention to dripping taps as they are symbolic of money being drained out of the house while clogged taps reflect money coming in too slowly. 

 Beds should be placed in the bedroom where they do not directly confront the toilet door. It is not auspicious to see the toilet door first thing early in the morning. 

 Tip of the week: Place fresh green plants along with a glass bowl filled with salt on the windowsills of the toilet to absorb the negative Chi of this area. Change the salt every week.

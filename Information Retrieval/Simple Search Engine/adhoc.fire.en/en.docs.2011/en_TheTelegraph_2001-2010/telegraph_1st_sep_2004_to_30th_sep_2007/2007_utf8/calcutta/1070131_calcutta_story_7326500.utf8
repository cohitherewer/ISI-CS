The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Live feed for a few homes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 No more than 25 per cent of cable and satellite homes in the city in the Netaji Nagar and Lake Town areas, CAS Phase I zone and TataSky subscribers will be able to watch Wednesdays ODI between India and West Indies live on Neo Sports.

 The rest will have to be content catching the seven-minute delayed feed to be telecast by Doordarshan.

 Sourav Ganguly is set to make yet another comeback at Vadodara after being rested at Chennai.

 Suresh Sethia, of Siti Cable, said on Tuesday that last weeks Delhi High Court order to Nimbus, the distributor of Neo Sports that has bought the rights to telecast all domestic and international matches on home turf, to share its signals with Prasar Bharati signalled relief for all multi-system operators (MSOs).

 After the first match, in which Sourav scored 98 runs, the pressure from consumers to watch the series has been mounting. The court order did help us stand firm on our demand for a revised rate, as the difference in tariff in the CAS and non-CAS areas was irrational, Sethia observed.

 Delhi High Court and the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal upheld the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) decision to accept the monthly tariff of Rs 37.25 per subscriber outside CAS areas, where the rate is Rs 5 per channel.

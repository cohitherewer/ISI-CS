 Chargesheet in IFA arson case

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The detective department chargesheeted two officials of the Indian Football Association (IFA) on Thursday and accused them of committing arson and setting important documents ablaze to destroy evidence. 

 Police mentioned in the chargesheet that accountant Kaushik Chandra, treasurer K.D. Paul and others had conspired to destroy evidence and suppress the misappropriation of about Rs 30 lakh.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said sleuths had found evidence which will prove how Chandra and Paul set on fire an IFA office room in Chandni Chowk on the night of March 13. Besides, the statements of other office staff will play an important part in the trial, Singh said.

 On March 13, a fire broke out in the IFA office and three fire extinguishers were used to put it out. Later, it was found that the fire was confined to just two racks of a cupboard in Chandras room, which forensic experts described as the seat of fire. Sleuths found out that it was a targeted fire. 

 They picked up Chandra from his Bauria residence, in Howrah, on March 28. By grilling him, sleuths came to know that he had misappropriated Rs 30 lakh in the past six to seven months with the help of Paul.

 The police discovered that on that day, Chandra had left office around 7.30pm, only to return around 8pm. He finally signed out around 9.30pm and took the durwan along with him for a cup of tea. When the guard returned, he noticed the fire.

 Our investigation revealed that Chandra possibly wanted to tamper with certain evidence related to the IFAs bank account, said Singh, the overseer of the probe.

 The police found some cheque books in Chandras possession which were not supposed to be with him. The IFA is conducting an internal investigation and we are sharing information. We have enough evidence to prove the accused guilty in court, said an officer working on this case.

 Some others are involved in the arson. We have mentioned them in the charge-sheet as unknown accused. We suspect that Chandras accomplices set the cupboard on fire after he went with the durwan for tea. Our probe will continue and if they are caught, they will have to face the same chargesheet, the deputy commissioner said.

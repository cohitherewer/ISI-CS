 Calcutta

 Universitys department of English

 is set to go beyond the boundaries

 of conventional education with its

 first self-financing programme called

 Postgraduate Certificate Course

 in English for Effective Communication

 (PGCC EEC). The six-month course

 will be introduced by the end of

 March. 

 The programme aims to develop and improve communication skills both at the personal and professional levels to help students adapt better to the changing globalised scenario, said Tanmay Ghosh, lecturer in the department of English, CU. 

 The syllabus will cover practical aspects of English phonetics, conversation and professional communication skills, which would include conference techniques, presentation skills in public speaking and interview skills. Related soft skills like interpersonal skills and positive personality traits will also be honed. The USP of the course is its aim to integrate four basic language skills listening, reading, speaking and writing, said Ghosh, who is the joint-coordinator for the course along with Shinjini Banerjee, the reader of the department. 

 Classes will be held thrice a week, with the course fee at Rs 6,000. Graduates of any age and stream are eligible to apply, but selection for the 30 seats will be on the basis of a written test.

 The course content will address a heterogeneous group and equip the students for jobs in BPOs, as medical transcriptionists, advertising copy-writers, teachers and in government and non- government organisations. The authorities claim the programme would be beneficial to professionals who wish to apply for a job in countries which would require them to be conversant in the English language.

 The new course will be a feather in the cap of CUs English department which is celebrating the centenary year of postgraduate teaching.

 French forum

 We had the opportunity to interact with two renowned personalities from France at a seminar on French literature and cinema, organised by CUs department of French on February 1.

 The chief guests at the event were Jean Echenoz, a well-known name in French fiction, and Jerome Beanjour, a sought-after scriptwriter in French cinema. During the session we asked them several questions with regard to the present scenario of and the public response to French literary works. The guests explained to us the difference between writing a novel and a script. They also told us that a good film could even be made despite a bad storyline.

 Echenoz then deliberated on some aspects of his style of writing. He explained that his novels were not autobiographies but an insight into his own experiences. He said his aim was to write less fiction and more reality. 

 We all loved the discussions and look forward to many more such events on campus.

 Mini models

 They were

 not professionals, stage fright

 got the better of some, while others

 just refused to step off the dais

 once they were there. But the baby

 show at Millennium Park on January

 28 was as much a head-turner as

 any high-profile fashion do (picture

 The show, presented by LauncherZ, was divided into four groups. In group A, kids between six months and two years competed for the Best Smile, Cute Look and Smart Baby prizes. The two to five-year-olds in group B were in the fray for the Best Smile, Smart Toddler and Best Walking Toddler awards. Children between five and 12 years were in groups C and D contesting in fashion show, group dance and talent show for the titles of Miss and Master Kolkata.

 Then there was a Mother and Me show where the kids walked on to the stage with their mothers. I have never taken part in a fashion show so it felt doubly great doing so with my kid in tow, said Bhumi Bhatia, mother of one-year-old Bhavya. 

 Not all were first-timers though. One-year-eight-month-old Disha had modelled for a news daily last Pujas, informed mother Sweta Doshi, who is a fashion designer.

 The children of groups A and B outdid even professional models in the denim round. Such was the performance of the kids that many parents were seriously considering letting them take up modelling when they grow up. I would not mind at all if my daughter pursued modelling, said Rashida Rehman, mother of 11-year-old Rubaba, who won the Miss Kolkata title in group D.

 The children and the mothers were groomed for a month by experts, while model Nicola helped with the choreography.

 The proceeds of the show went to the children of Refuge, an NGO.

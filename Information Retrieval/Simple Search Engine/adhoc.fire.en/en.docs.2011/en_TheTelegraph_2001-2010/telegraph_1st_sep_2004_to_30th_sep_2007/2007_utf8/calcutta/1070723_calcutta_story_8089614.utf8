 Daycare centre for children

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A daycare centre for children was inaugurated in Salt Lakes IA block on Sunday.

 The franchise of the first city centre of Kidzcare, an initiative of Zee Interactive Learning Systems (ZILS), is held by septuagenarian Kajol Mukherjee, who co-founded Durgapur Nursery and KG School in 1962.

 Ever since she moved to Salt Lake a couple of years ago, Mukherjee had been looking for an opportunity to put her teaching experience of 42 years to some productive use.

 Six months ago, I was looking for a crche for my granddaughter. I saw an advertisement of Kidzee, the pre-school programme of ZILS, and called them. Thats when I came to know about Kidzcare, Mukherjee said.

 ZILS chief executive officer Arun Khetan said the company has set very high standards for granting Kidzcare franchisee rights.

 We look for people from educated families, who are serious about work and have enough empathy for children. There were more than 80 applications, but Mukherjees background clinched it for her, he added.

 The need for daycare centres for children has been on the rise, with both parents going out for work and the disintegration of joint families.

 The first Kidzcare centre in the country was set up in Delhi. Such centres have also come up in Bangalore and Hyderabad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Spaced out

 Last evening, I saw a news clip of astronaut Sunita Williams talking to students in Punjab from space, and marvelled not at the ingenuity of it, but how commonplace all this has become. In three or four years time, we may well see Stephen Hawking in space, lecturing on the world, the universe and everything from a spaceship spinning 100 km over the earth. And if you, gentle reader, had enough money say $200,000 then you could also find yourself a passenger on Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic, which plans to offer sub-orbital spaceflights to the paying public from 2009.

 But later that night, a memory waved a tentacle from the murky depths of my subconscious: what would Kartik Chandra Paul have thought of all this?

 If you claim to live in Calcutta and do not know who K.C. Paul is, then I am afraid you are not the real article. For the past three decades, Paul has been the most tirelessly dedicated graffitist in this fair city, leaving his mark from Tala to Tollygunge without fair and favour. Working with nothing more fancy than whitewash and black paint, Paul has been proclaiming that it is the sun which goes round the earth, and not the other way round: Galileo, Copernicus, Aristarchus of Samos had all got it wrong.

 I met Kartik Chandra Paul 18 years ago when a friend and I had gone to interview him for a now-defunct magazine called Calcutta Skyline. We had sought him in deepest Howrah and had met a shy unassuming man, who lived in a two-roomed house by a pond covered with the ubiquitous water hyacinth. Amidst grazing cattle and waddling ducks, the man had stood gesticulating wildly as he talked of Ptolemy and cosmology. Behind him, the whitewashed walls of his house were covered with astronomical diagrams.

 Paul had told us that he was in the armed forces when he studied the movement of the evening stars and became suspicious about the position of Venus. After a course of self-study he came to the conclusion that while the heliocentrists were right about rotation, they had got it wrong on revolution. In 1974, he concluded that the earth stood still and the sun travelled around it with its orbit titled at an angle of 231/2. Among the other things he said was that Mercury and Venus orbited the sun, and the three of them were orbiting the earth as a system. The outer planets orbited the sun but were not moving along with it. Paul had even corresponded with NASA on the subject but the space body had politely told him that they were satisfied with the heliocentric system.

 Unfortunately for Paul, almost all of recent astronomy contradicts his theory. But I still remember how both my friend and I were charmed with the quiet assurance of the man, and his unshakeable belief that one day the astronomical textbooks would have to be rewritten. If Richard Branson has another free seat going on his ship, I would strongly recommend Kartik Chandra Paul for it.

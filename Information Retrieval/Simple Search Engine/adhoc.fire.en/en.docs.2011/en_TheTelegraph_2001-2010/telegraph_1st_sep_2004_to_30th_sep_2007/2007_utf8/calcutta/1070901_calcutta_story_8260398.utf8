 Protesters assaulted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A few students from Presidency College and Jadavpur University were allegedly beaten up by SFI supporters of Scottish Church College while they were holding a protest outside the institution on Friday afternoon.

 One of them was admitted to Medical College and Hospital with severe pain.

 The protesters, who had gathered under the banner of the United Students Democratic Front (USDF), lodged a police complaint against Vikram Poddar, Asish Manna and others.

 Seven USDF supporters had turned up in front of Scottish Church College to protest the recent assault on supporters of the Forum for Independent Students, allegedly by SFI members who rule the union.

 A large mob of SFI supporters came out of the college and charged at us around 1.30pm. All seven of us were beaten up, though we were holding a peaceful demonstration, said Dipanjan Sinha, the general secretary of the Presidency College Students Union. They tore up our posters and broke the microphones, he added.

 Subhasree Roy, a third-year student of Presidency College, said: When the SFI supporters were about to attack one of my juniors, I stepped in to hold them off. But they rained blows on me, without bothering where the blows were landing.

 She was taken to hospital, where she was administered a pain-killer injection. An X-ray revealed no haemorrhage, but I am still finding it difficult to move around, she added.

 Poddar and Manna could not be contacted, while Apurba Chatterjee, the SFI state secretary, refused to comment.

 Of the seven protesters, four were from Presidency College (Independents Consolidation) and the rest from Jadavpur University (Forum for Arts Students).

 Downpour ordeal in drainage disaster

 Smritikana Ghosh, a resident of Sukanta Sarani, in Behala, is living in fear, even as she prays for the skies to relent.

 An employee of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, Ghosh has to make a dash for her neighbourhood pharmacy to fetch emergency medicine for her ailing mother at odd hours. I have to wade through knee-deep, filthy water every time I step out of home, she rues.

 Most residents of Behala and Thakurpukur share her plight, as incessant rain for three days has made life miserable. Vast areas are still under water, including Mahendra Banerjee Road, Unique Park, Barisha, Gopal Mishra Road, Indira Devi Road, Sakher Bazar and Silpara, all falling under Borough XIII and XIV.

 According to local Trinamul Congress councillor Anjan Das, some of these areas have been flooded for the first time. While the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) pumps pressed into action have failed to make much of an impact, Sovan Chattopadhyay, chairman of Borough XIV, blames failure to desilt the canals in the area in time for this unprecedented waterlogging.

 City-based architect-planner Mukul Mitra agrees that encroachment on the natural drainage channel of the area, Begor Khal, and failure to adequately desilt other outlets, including the Charial Khal, have also contributed to the drainage disaster.

 Mitra feels unplanned and haphazard growth without the required infrastructure has aggravated the problem. He also holds the CMDA responsible for the lack of macro planning in the area, which saw a population explosion after the widening of Diamond Harbour Road.

 Arati Mukherjee, a resident of Sakher Bazar, who has been perched on her cot for three days now, is planning to temporarily relocate to a relatives place with her family, so her husband can go to work. With the weather office having predicted another 48-hour downpour ordeal, more marooned families in Behala are likely to seek drier havens.

 Experts also blame rapid urbanisation, leading to more and more paved surface areas, for the waterlogging. Earlier, we had a fair sprinkling of earth and soft surfaces in the city, which would absorb water. Now, even tramlines are being hard-paved, which is good news for motorists, but impeding natural absorption, says architect and urban designer Partha Ranjan Das.

 Deliberate filling-up of waterbodies in the area for housing purposes has been identified by planners as another key factor responsible for the deluge. Besides, Calcuttas topography is a perennial problem, since the city is shaped like a saucer between the EM Bypass and the river, and water tends to flow towards the low-lying zones, Das points out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The air we breathe, the water we drink...

 How green was our city. A Telegraph picture

 On the World Environment Day, Metro takes a closer look at the citys ambience and rolls out a wish list that will ensure cleaner surroundings for all of us... 

 Air

 Status: Several national and international studies conducted by the World Bank and other bodies have pointed out that 5,000-10,000 people die every year in Calcutta because of the dust they inhale. Calcutta and Delhi top the list of the most polluted cities of India. But while the situation in Delhi is improving, its in reverse gear in Calcutta.

 Problem areas: Automobile exhaust mostly from diesel-driven commercial vehicles and rampant construction activities all around. Industrial pollution has been largely controlled, though there are still some rogue pockets in the north and south.

 Wish list: Let the government implement the laws to check tailpipe emission and take initiatives to popularise safe fuel, says green activist Subhas Dutta.

 Water

 Status: Ground water is fast depleting, while the surface water supplied by the civic body has, at times, been found to be contaminated. The Central Ground Water Board says the ground water level has gone down by 30 ft in some areas. Arsenic poisoning is a cause of concern.

 Problem areas: Uncontrolled extraction of ground water, triggered by unplanned urbanisation (a major part of the city is still dependent on ground water).

 Wish list: Extraction of ground water has to be minimised, says a CMDA official.

 Noise

 Status: Calcutta is among the nosiest cities, though it was the first to witness judicial intervention to curb noise pollution. Studies by the state pollution control board have revealed that the noise level in various pockets is much higher than the optimum value of 65 decibel. Activists claim attempts at curbing noise pollution have slackened in the past few years.

 Problem areas: Vehicular noise, including honking of horns, and the noise generated by construction activities. Crackers and loudspeakers are also to be blamed.

 Wish list: Unnecessary honking, specially in silence zones, should stop. Its unfortunate that only a handful of hospitals has been designated silence zones, says Justice (retd) Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee.

 Waterbodies and wetlands

 Status: Realtors are eyeing the Ramsar-recognised East Calcutta Wetlands and its adjoining areas. A management action plan for the East Calcutta Wetlands is yet to be ready, while smaller waterbodies are being devoured by the realty.

 Problem areas: Rampant illegal construction across the city and on the fringes.

 Wish list: The government should come up with an action plan to preserve the East Calcutta Wetlands. There should also be proper enumeration of smaller waterbodies, says environmentalist and academician Mohit Roy.

 Open space and greenery 

 Status: A high court-appointed committee had said in 2000 that the city had less than one per cent organised open space, against the international norm of 12 per cent. The Maidan, comprising two-thirds of the citys open space, is under constant threat, often from the government.

 Problem areas: Unplanned urbanisation and lack of any serious attempt at increasing the green space.

 Wish list: We should plant more trees and make sure they survive. Trees should not be allowed to be felled without compensatory plantation, says environmentalist S.M. Ghosh.

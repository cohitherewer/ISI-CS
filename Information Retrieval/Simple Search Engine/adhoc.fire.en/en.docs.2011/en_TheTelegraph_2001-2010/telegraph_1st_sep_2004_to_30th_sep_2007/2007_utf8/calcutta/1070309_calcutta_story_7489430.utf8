 Light out of darkness

 Artists with originality and inner passion often build up a spontaneity of expression that is markedly different from the studied and polished styles of formally trained ones. The naivet of expression of Sumana Ghoshs paintings brings them close to the concept of pure invention. Exploring Darkness, the ongoing exhibition of her paintings and drawings, showcases images that bear traces of expressionist vigour and, at the same time, are touched with mystic serenity. Her intrinsic innocence, wonder and awe appear to guide the young artist into transforming the reality around her into art. Apart from linear forms with a few splashes of watercolour, Ghosh has mainly worked with tempera on hand-made paper and canvas. The two paintings in oil pastel on black pastel paper explore darkness as a means of exposing the loneliness of the self. This exploration then becomes the key that leads her on to extract light out of darkness in most of her paintings. 

 Event: Paintings and drawings by Sumana Ghosh When: Till March 9; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Chemould Art Gallery, 12F Park Street

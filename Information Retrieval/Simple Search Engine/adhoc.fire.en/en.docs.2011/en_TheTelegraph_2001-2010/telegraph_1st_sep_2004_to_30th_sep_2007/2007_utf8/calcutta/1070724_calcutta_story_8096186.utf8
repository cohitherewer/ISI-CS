The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Schools, not road rules 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Problem: Too many deadly drivers.

 Solution: Many more driving schools.

 Thats the foolproof formula in the simple world of Subhas Chakraborty, where licences are earned and not bought, where road rules are followed and not flouted.

 Worried by the rising accident graph due to rash driving, the state government is gearing up not to make the procedure to get, or renew, a licence more stringent, but to set up several motor driving training institutes in collaboration with the Centre.

 Announcing this in the Assembly on Monday, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said the institutes will be set up on the premises of 30 transport depots of the government in the city and its suburbs.

 Admitting that most road mishaps occur due to the fault of those behind the wheel, Chakraborty said the government will ensure that all those attending these driving schools are put to the test before being given licences.

 The demand for driving licences is rising every day. The number of good motor training institutes is inadequate. That is one reason why some people are getting driving licences before developing the required skill, rued the minister. And that is a major reason for the spate of accidents on city streets and highways.

 And how will the proposed institutes improve matters? They will provide rigorous training applying the simulator technique, claimed Chakraborty, adding that special emphasis would be on training those driving state transport vehicles.

 The minister was responding to a supplementary question by Barry OBrien, the MLA representing the Anglo-Indian community, on what the government was doing, considering that 80 per cent of the accidents occur due to the fault of drivers.

 It is no secret that the present loopholes allow procurement of a licence bypassing the test or by just going through the motions with the help of touts near the public vehicles department office or by paying driving schools an extra fee. The renewal process three years for drivers on commercial duty is also farcical, with bribes and contacts doing the trick instead of driving tests.

 To review road safety, a state-level convention on improvement of transport facilities will be held in September, said Chakraborty. Transport operators and officials will meet to throw up ideas. Their implementation is another matter altogether.

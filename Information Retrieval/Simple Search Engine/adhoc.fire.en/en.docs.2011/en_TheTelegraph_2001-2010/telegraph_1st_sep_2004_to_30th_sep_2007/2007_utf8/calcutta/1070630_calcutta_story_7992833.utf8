 Night of the blue moon 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcuttans will get to see the proverbial blue moon on Saturday evening when, for the second time in June, there will be a full moon. 

 The first full moon this month was on June 1. On Saturday, the full moon will be visible from 6.45pm. It can be seen overhead around midnight.

 Youll be disappointed if you expect a blue-coloured moon. Its an astronomers term which became a proverb. The moon will be silver or greyish white, as it usually is. But this will be a rare occurrence, which is usually seen after two-and-a-half years, said Debiprosad Duari, director (research and academics), MP Birla Planetarium.

 After June 30, people will have to wait till 2009-end to see the blue moon once again.

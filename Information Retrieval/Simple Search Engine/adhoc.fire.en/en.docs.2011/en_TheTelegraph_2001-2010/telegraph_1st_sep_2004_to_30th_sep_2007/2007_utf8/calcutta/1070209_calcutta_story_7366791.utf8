The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Schools slam the brakes

 OUR BUREAU

 Underage driving has to stop city schools are in chorus after a speeding car driven by a drunken Class XI student of South Point school, accompanied by four classmates, knocked down three girls near Nazrul Mancha on Wednesday. 

 To curb the menace, the authorities of reputed city schools have decided to approach the motor vehicles department to take appropriate measures and stop issuing driving licences to minors.

 Schoolboys cannot concentrate on their studies if they ride or drive. Instead, they get exposed to many hazards, which can spoil their careers and lives, said Reverend P.S.P Raju, bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India (CNI).

 Aware that a section of parents considers it fashionable to provide motorcycles to their wards even before they graduate to college, the school authorities want to involve the parents in the process.

 Our principals will soon hold meetings with guardians and chalk out a strategy to ensure that the ban on using two and four-wheelers by our students is effectively implemented, he added. 

 Utsav Dutta, the South Point school student, rammed his red Maruti Alto into three students of Basanti Devi College near Nazrul Mancha. 

 Dutta and his four classmates Abhishek Saha, Dipayan Rai, Deep Roy and Aniruddha Gupta missed school on Wednesday for an afternoon tipple at a friends place in Dhakuria. 

 Police had arrested Dutta on charges of drunken driving, but his friends were let off. 

 We are shocked and are investigating the matter, said Jayati Solomon, principal, South Point school. 

 Once we have collected all the facts, we will take action against them, she said, adding that the authorities will keep in mind the future of the students. 

 But Utsav, who spent the Wednesday night in Lake police station, has already learnt his lesson. He told us he was too ashamed to show his face at home or in school, said a police officer, who tried to counsel the young man, urging him to forget the past.

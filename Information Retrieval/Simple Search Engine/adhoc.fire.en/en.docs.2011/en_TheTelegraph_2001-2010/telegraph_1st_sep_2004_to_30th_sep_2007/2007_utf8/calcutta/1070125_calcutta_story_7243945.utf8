 Barbie for home amp; hair

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 For kids who love their Barbie 

 but are looking for a hi-tech twist to their playthings, 

 the blonde bombshell has a whole new range of homemaking 

 gizmos, just like mom has in her kitchen and dressing room.

 While Barbie traditionally has a host of fantasy accessories like cars, dream houses, castles and even offices, there is a real-life element to some of the latest offerings.

 There are items like washing machines and microwaves, which are pure make-believe, of course. The play washing machine is pink, but the sounds of washing, cleaning and drying create the illusion that your child keeps busy helping around the house! 

 She can have her own coffee maker too. There are also other gadgets, such as a camera, which takes real digital pictures and a CD player that will play its own set of Barbie CDs.

 Kids today are no longer satisfied with a Barbie doll, living room or bedroom Barbie sets. Girls love that hi-tech touch in their playthings. The items are flying off the rack fast, explains Deepa Seth from Queen Of Hearts, the City Centre store that is home to the Barbie goodies. 

 Girls aged three to 13 years have taken to the collection particularly enthusiastically.

 Utility aside, hair fashion is hot and happening with gadgets your child will love to handle. If you are tired of turning down your baby girls requests to try out your brand-new hairdryer, it might be time to get her one of her own. The Barbie-branded battery-operated blow dryer in trademark pink is bound to keep her happy for a few years at least!

 A hair-beader is an innovative contraption in pink and mauve, with flowers and heart-shaped buttons. It comes along with 90 assorted beads in a mix of shapes like stars, flowers and squares to embellish tiny tresses with colourful add-ons. 

 The hair wrap device is accompanied by bright coloured strings that can be wrapped around locks of hair. That is not the only way to provide a dash of colour to a young head. The Barbie hair-streaking kit will allow you to highlight those strands in washable hues of pink, blue or silver. All you need to do is squeeze colour on the hair tongs that come with the kit and press it across the locks. 

 The nail decoration studio is also sure to impress. False nails could be jazzed up with crystals, polish and a host of designs.

 These girlie goodies are priced 

 at Rs 430 onwards and can go up to a few thousands.

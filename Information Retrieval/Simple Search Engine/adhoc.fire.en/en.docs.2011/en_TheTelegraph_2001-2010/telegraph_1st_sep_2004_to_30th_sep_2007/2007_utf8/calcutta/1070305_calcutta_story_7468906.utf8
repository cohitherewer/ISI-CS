 Calcuttas corporate hospitals are fast catching up with their counterparts in other cities in India in upgrading their technology for the benefit of patients and their families.

 Taking the lead is Wockhardt Hospital, which has lined up a slew of information technology-related services that are likely to be commissioned by the middle of the year.

 The hospital will soon instal webcams in the patients rooms to facilitate virtual visits by family members.

 A small video clipping of the patient immediately after a surgery will be uploaded on the Net for relatives to access, said Rupali Basu, general manager, Wockhardt, Calcutta. Later, we will install webcams and patients will be able to interact with their family members through live chat.

 The facility had been earlier introduced in Wockhardt hospitals in Bangalore and Mumbai.

 The hospital will also set up wi-fi zones at its kidney hospital (on Rashbehari Avenue), medical centre (off Minto Park) and in the proposed multi-speciality hospital on EM Bypass.

 Executives who come for regular check-ups under corporate tie-up schemes can log on to the Net using a prepaid wi-fi card and carry on their work while waiting for their turn, explained Basu.

 The hospital will also have interactive kiosks, where patients advised a surgery or their relatives can have detailed information about the procedure and its fallouts. Doctors, too, would be engaged to answer the queries online.

 The hospital is also introducing Operating Theatre Image Management System mainly for the benefit of practising doctors and postgraduate students, said Basu.

 Explaining the system, an official said the three operating theatres of the kidney hospital will be networked and surgeries taking place there would be recorded online for study.

 Calcutta Medical Research Institute, too, has upgraded its information management system. Apart from introducing modules for admission, discharge and other services, it has introduced an SMS alert for doctors. Whenever a patient is admitted, the doctor will automatically get an SMS alert, said Rupak Barua, chief operating officer, CMRI.

 Apollo Gleneagles Hospital will introduce a system which will help relatives talk with patients even beyond visiting hours. A room with video conference facilities will be earmarked for relatives who cannot turn up during visiting hours. Doctors permitting, relatives can speak to patients through video-conferencing, said a hospital spokesperson.

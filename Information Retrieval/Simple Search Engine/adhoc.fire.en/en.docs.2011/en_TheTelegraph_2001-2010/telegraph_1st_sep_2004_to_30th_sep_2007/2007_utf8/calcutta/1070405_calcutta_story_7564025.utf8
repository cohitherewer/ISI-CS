 Rethink at tech varsity 

 - Heat on made-easy books

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Students of private engineering colleges are fast turning to made-easy books for better and easy marks in exams, much to the worry of the affiliating university.

 To buck the trend, the authorities of West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) are planning a slew of measures, including a revamp of the question pattern, to ensure that only students with a thorough knowledge of the textbooks could score good marks.

 Its a matter of concern that made-easy books for engineering courses are now available in the market and a section of students of our colleges is taking the help of such material, said WBUT vice-chancellor Ashoke Thakur. Students have to stop this practice, as it is against the universitys goal to produce engineers for the national and international markets, he added.

 Thakur warned the students that selective study would not fetch them good marks once the exam system is restructured. There will be no alternative to in-depth study of textbooks.

 The other measures the university has lined up to wean students off the made-easy books mostly written in the question-answer format include revising the syllabus in quick intervals, setting up teachers training centres, facilitating students access to e-books and e-journals and continuous monitoring of the laboratory facilities of the colleges. 

 Around 70 private engineering colleges in the city and elsewhere in the state are affiliated to the university.

 Students, however, claimed they are forced to study the made-easy stuff. Chunks of the syllabus remain untaught in our college every semester, as there are not enough teachers. Hence, there is no option for us but to study those made-easy books, pointed out an electrical engineering student of a college on the northern fringes of the city.

 A computer science student of a Salt Lake college said: Some portions of our syllabus are of the IIT standard, though our teachers are not a patch on those in the premier institutes. What else could we do except turning to made-easy books?

 Police are among those who have been hit the hardest by non-stop rain over three days. And unlike civilians, they have had to suffer in silence.

 The airport police station has been in such a shape since Tuesday that the undertrials have had to be shifted to NSC Bose police station. The officers had provided chairs and sofas for the undertrials to sit on in the flooded lock-ups, but they refused to stay. 

 The undertrials claimed that they would fall ill if they were kept in the lock-up. During court production, if they complain to the judge that they were kept in an inundated lock-up, we will be rebuked for torturing them. So we had to shift them, said an officer of airport police station. 

 Those detained are now being bought to airport police station for paperwork and immediately sent to NSC Bose police station.

 The situation highlights the inhuman condition in which the personnel of airport police station have to work in, with senior officers paying scant attention to the problem.

 The entire police station, including the barracks, is inundated. This happens every season but nobody cares, said another officer of the police station. The duty officer has had to sit for 12 hours in water. Those off duty had to stay put on beds a little higher than the filthy water. The armoury is submerged, too. 

 The problem is not restricted to airport police station. At the Baguiati traffic guard, officers had to keep a bucket on the table to work. Water is seeping through the roof of the adjacent barracks. Some officers went to sleep wearing helmets, fearing that the roof would collapse, said a senior officer.

 The officers of Lake Town traffic guard had to shift to a makeshift room next door because of water dripping from the roof.

 Most of the senior officers of these police stations, including the officers-in-charge, have stayed at home since the start of the showers. It is the subordinate officers who are suffering. We dont know what happens to the crores of rupees provided for modernisation, said an officer.

 North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar admitted the problem: We are identifying the worst affected police stations and will renovate them soon.

 Sleep well for safe delivery

 SANJAY MANDAL AND PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 If you are an insomniac mother-to-be, chances are that both you and your child are in danger, according to experts. The hazards may vary from frequent changes in hormone levels to cardiac problems.

 Pregnant women who suffer from insomnia also run the risk of physiological complications, which can affect the child, too. The incidence of such complications, say doctors, has gone up by nearly 10 per cent in the past five years.

 Insomnia in a pregnant woman can affect the growth of the baby, stated gynaecologist Ranjit Chakraborty. In some cases, doctors are forced to opt for premature delivery to avoid complications.

 Which, according to Apurba Ghosh, the director of Institute of Child Health, is unsafe. A child born before the 30th week of gestation needs intensive care.

 Almost 30 per cent of the total deliveries are premature and 70 per cent of those born before the 30th week do not survive, stated Ghosh. The organs of premature babies do not function properly. Their liver is prone to jaundice and their immunity level is low, rendering them vulnerable to infection.

 In such cases, the child is kept in an incubator and on ventilation to artificially create an atmosphere akin to that of the womb until the organs are fully developed. 

 During the gestation period, the mothers body undergoes a lot of hormonal changes, causing restlessness, sleeplessness and an increase in the blood volume and heart rate. 

 These are natures way of preparing the body for a safe delivery, said Chakraborty. Use of stimulants like caffeine and nicotine add to the woes. We sometimes prescribe soporifics in low doses.

 But self-medication can be hazardous. Some pills are not only addictive, but also cause cleft lip in the child if taken in the early gestation period, said the doctor.

 Insomniac pregnant women are advised to relax as much as possible for a safe delivery. Yoga, meditation, soothing music and comfortable room temperature are helpful. A glass of hot milk before bedtime may also help, said Chakraborty.

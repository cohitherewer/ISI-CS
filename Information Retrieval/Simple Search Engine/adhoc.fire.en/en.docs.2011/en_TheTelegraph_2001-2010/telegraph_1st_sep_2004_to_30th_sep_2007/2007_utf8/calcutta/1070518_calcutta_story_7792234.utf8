 Magic wand for GeNext

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Maneka Sorcar: Maya memsaab

 The magic wand has been handed down to GeNext.

 P.C. Sorcar Junior announced on Thursday that eldest daughter Maneka, 27, will carry on the family legacy of wielding the wand. 

 He himself had inherited the magic mantle from father PC Sorcar, known as the Maharaja of Indian Magic, in 1971. Maneka will make her solo debut at Star Theatre on May 23.

 Girls in this country are in no way inferior to men. Theyve established themselves in every field. So, it is only natural for Maneka to fill up the gap that still exists in the sphere of magic, which has essentially been a male bastion, said Sorcar Junior, while bequeathing the legacy to his daughter.

 Maneka, an MBA from Ohio University, held her first public show, along with her father, on February 23 (birthday of her grandfather and also observed as Magicians Day), 1999. Since then, she has been performing several magical feats, including bringing the Taj Mahal back after her father made it vanish.

 She recently filmed a docu-feature based on the life and works of her grandfather.

 About her week-long show at Star Theatre, titled Maya Vigyan, Maneka said: I will use the platform to blend maya (magic) with science. Apart from showing tricks made popular by both junior and senior Sorcars, the show will have my individual touch. It is contemporary in the way that I have feminised it... Very soon, I want to organise an all-woman show, she smiled.

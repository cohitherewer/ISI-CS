The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro VIP coach

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel vacated a crowded Metro Railway coach at Shyambazar station on Monday afternoon to create space for VIPs who were to board the train at Esplanade.

 About five officers boarded the first coach of the Tollygunge-bound train and ordered the passengers, including those sitting, to get off.

 Children, women and senior citizens were forced to move to the next coach through the vestibule.

 Later, some passengers were allowed to stand at one end of the coach.

 The VIPs were the members of a delegation from Dhaka who were in the city to hold talks with the government on the upcoming train service between India and Bangladesh. The members boarded the train at Esplanade and travelled till Tollygunge.

 We were surprised to find so many RPF officers at the station. I thought the security had been beefed up. But the men boarded the coach and asked us to vacate it, said Soma Roy, who was returning home with her daughter.

 As the train was about to leave Central station, an elderly man squeezed into the coach. Even as he was gasping for breath, the RPF officers asked him to move to the next compartment.

 Why should I? I am a bona fide passenger, asked the man, who later identified himself as Ajit Nath, a retired railway employee.

 The Metro authorities pleaded concerns for the security of the visitors.

 The delegation members wanted to see the Metro system as they plan to start a similar service in Dhaka, said a Metro official.

 They could have announced this before the train arrived. We could have easily left the coach empty, said a student of Rabindra Bharati, who boarded the train at Shyambazar.

 Foreign delegates should definitely be provided security. To ensure that, the authorities should not have allowed passengers to board the coach from Dum Dum, observed another passenger.

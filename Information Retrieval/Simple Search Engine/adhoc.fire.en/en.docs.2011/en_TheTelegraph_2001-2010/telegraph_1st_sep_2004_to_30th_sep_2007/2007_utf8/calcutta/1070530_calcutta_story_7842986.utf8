The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Thai focus on virgin locales

 A STAFF REPORTER

Bangkok, Phuket and Pattaya may be the most popular tourist destinations by far in Thailand, but there is a lot more to explore in the country. 

 The Thailand government is planning to promote lesser-known places to attract more travellers.

 A survey, conducted recently by the Royal Thai Consulate in Calcutta, has revealed that city tourists prefer to start a Thailand tour at Bangkok and move on to Phuket and Pattaya. 

 We are promoting new destinations to give tourists an opportunity to explore our country, said Manop Mekprayoonthong, consul-general of Thailand. 

 He was speaking at an interactive session organised by the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce on Saturday. We receive about 200 visa applications daily. This shows that the country draws a major chunk of tourists from the city, he said. 

 Mekprayoonthong stressed the need for cooperation in the tourism sector. A delegation of Travel Agents Federation of India (Tafi) will be visiting Bangkok on May 30 to explore the possibility of promoting new destinations.

 We need to explore new destinations as tourists want more options, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Tafi.

 A few virgin spots in Thailand

 are Koh Chang, Krabi, Limestone Islands, Than Bok Khorani

 National Park and the hot spring at Namtok Ron Khlong

 Thom .

 Koh Chang is a virgin beach, near the Cambodian border, where tourists can enjoy boating, canoeing, hiking and trekking. Krabi, an hours drive from Phuket, is cheaper than other Thai cities.

 The Thai government will soon open a trade office in Calcutta to strengthen ties, said the consul-general.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Jittery cablemen amp; confused viewers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fears over watching Saas 

The confusion over the conditional access system (CAS) is trickling down to areas beyond the parts of Calcutta, where the new regime was introduced on the first day of 2007. 

 A section of unscrupulous cable operators is misguiding the consumers by spreading the word that a decision on the roll-out of the next phase of CAS has already been taken by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). 

 The local cablewallah told me that CAS will roll out in our area in a months time and we need to apply beforehand to receive uninterrupted television viewing, said Binoy Mukherjee, a resident of Baguiati,

 His cablewallah kept pressing him to sign an agreement and apply for a set-top box (STB) the tool needed to access selected channels in the new regime. 

 As I had not seen any advertisement in the local dailies or on television, I was not sure and asked him to come back later, added Mukherjee. 

 Sticking to the new-year deadline set by TRAI, CAS entered cable homes in pockets of Alipore, New Alipore, Behala, Chetla, Budge Budge, Garden Reach, Thakurpukur, Tollygunge, Haridevpur and Mahestala. But TRAI has not taken any decision on the areas to be covered in the next phases. 

 We are holding meetings with broadcasters, distributors and multi-system operators (MSOs) and review the roll out results of the first phase Once we are through with it, we will plan about the next phases, clarified Nripendra Mishra, chairman, TRAI. 

 According to industry insiders, there is no possibility of the next phase roll-out before May, 2007. 

 But Ranajit Basu, a resident of Bijoygarh, was told by his neighbourhood cablewallah that CAS would be launched in the area by mid February. 

 I was given a deal The cablewallah told me if I applied for the STB now, I would get a discount of Rs 500, said Basu, who is missing some of his favourite channels for the past few days. We have been told that we can access them after opting for CAS and applying for a STB, Basu said.

 Residents of Salt Lake have also been informed about the CAS roll-out from mid-February. As direct-to-home (DTH) service providers like Tata Sky and DishTV are fast eating into their market share, local cable operators are jittery about their customer base. This feeling of insecurity lies behind such misinformation, explained a TRAI official.

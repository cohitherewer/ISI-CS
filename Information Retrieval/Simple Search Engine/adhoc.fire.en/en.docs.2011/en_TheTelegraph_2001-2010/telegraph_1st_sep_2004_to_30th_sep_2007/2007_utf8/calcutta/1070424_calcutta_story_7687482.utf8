 Hospital in probe heat

 - Death after halt of medicine supply under state scanner

 A STAFF REPORTER

The state health department has started a probe into the death of Patrick Cranston, 57, at a city hospital less than a day after the authorities stopped his treatment and medicine supply because of non-payment of dues.

 We have ordered a probe following a complaint against Mission of Mercy Hospital and Research Centre, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said on Monday. He, however, did not mention who had lodged the complaint.

 Director of health services Sanchita Bakshi said the complainant is a resident of Cranstons neighbourhood, not a member of his family.

 A health department team will visit the hospital on Tuesday as part of the probe, Bakshi added. We will question the doctors and other employees and check all documents related to the case. We will investigate the case from all angles to find out what had led the authorities to stop Cranstons treatment.

 Cranston was admitted to Park Street hospital, earlier known as Assembly of God Church Hospital, in a critical condition on Wednesday last. He had been suffering from diabetes, cardiac disorder and several other ailments and was taken to the ICCU.

 On Friday morning, a note from the office of medical administrator Jatrik Biswas (a copy of which is with The Telegraph) asked the ICCU sister-in-charge to stop all services and indenting medicine for Cranston, whose dues had run up to more than Rs 24,000. 

 The patient died in less than 24 hours after the despatch of the note, signed by Mariamma George, assistant to the medical administrator.

 Biswas said on Monday that an inquiry committee set up by the hospital has show-caused George, a decision some doctors have protested. George has been made a scapegoat, said one of the doctors.

 Biswas had said on Saturday that the authorities had intended to stop only non-emergency services and supply of medicines from the hospital pharmacy. By mistake, the note mentioned all services, instead of non-emergency services, Biswas had said. 

 He had also quoted the hospitals rules, which state that non-emergency services to a patient could be stopped if the dues run up more than Rs 5,000.

 A Supreme Court judgment, however, specifies that a private healthcare institution must treat an emergency patient even if he cannot pay the bills immediately.

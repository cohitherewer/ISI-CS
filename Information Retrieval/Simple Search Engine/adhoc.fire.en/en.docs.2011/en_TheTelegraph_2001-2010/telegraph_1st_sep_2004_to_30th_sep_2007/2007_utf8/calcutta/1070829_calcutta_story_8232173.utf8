 SFI form on political link irks students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The SFI-controlled union in Rajabajar Science College, backed by the authorities, is forcing students seeking admission to postgraduate courses to disclose their political leanings.

 The students are being given forms with queries about their links with the unions at the undergraduate institutes. 

 SFI leaders are distributing the forms from the office of Calcutta University (CU)s science secretary, giving the students an impression that it was part of the official process. The union, however, has its office on the campus.

 The students are being asked to state whether they were involved with the union in their undergraduate college; if yes, how; and whether they had ever participated in any social work. They are also being asked to state their caste and their parents annual income.

 The move, never witnessed before on any campus of CU, has created resentment among the admission-seekers. The union leaders are forcing us to fill up the form. They have no right to do so, said an admission-seeker, who did not want to be named.

 Since a union is always backed by a political group, asking us whether we supported it at college is the same as forcing us to state our political preferences. How is the information linked with the admission process? he asked.

 Another student said: I did not want to fill up the form, but the union leaders forced me to. The employees in the secretarys office spoke in favour of the union members.

 Shyamal Sarkar, the science secretary of the university, said the authorities had allowed the union to distribute the forms from his office because it had a noble intention in seeking information from the students. The union wants to know about the economic condition of the students, as it wants to help those who are from poor families.

 Sarkar, however, is in the dark about the other queries.

 Sanhita Bhattacharya, the joint secretary of SFIs Calcutta University local committee, said it was a routine practice for the union to collect information about new students.

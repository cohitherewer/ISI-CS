 In police net, for 46 cases

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fugitive killer Sheikh Abdur Rahman, alias Raja, wanted in at least 46 criminal cases, was arrested on Tuesday. 

 The 31-year-old on the run after killing former Forward Bloc councillor of Mahestala municipality Shah Alam in December 2005 was rounded up near Akra railway station, on the southern fringes of the city.

 One of Alams relatives had hired Rahman to carry out the operation. We were on the lookout for him since the murder. In the meantime, he also got involved in the murder of Suto, a local criminal of Mahestala, and a daring robbery at a petrol pump, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).

 Police recovered five kg ganja, worth Rs 20,000, from Rahman. Later in the day, two of his associates Raja Khan and Binod were arrested in a house near Mahestala market. Police seized two firearms from the duo. 

 Rahman led a gang that operated in parts of south Calcutta and the southern fringes, including Metiabruz, Mahestala, Zinjira Bazar, Akra and Budge Budge. From contract killing to drug-peddling, Rahmans gang was involved in various criminal activities 

 Finally, he has been arrested We can only hope that criminal activities will now come down in the area, said a local resident, heaving a sigh of relief. 

 Rahman had been arrested earlier, in 2004, in connection with a robbery, and he was sent to jail for six months. 

 A few days after coming out of jail, he killed the councillor against a hefty payment, said a police officer.

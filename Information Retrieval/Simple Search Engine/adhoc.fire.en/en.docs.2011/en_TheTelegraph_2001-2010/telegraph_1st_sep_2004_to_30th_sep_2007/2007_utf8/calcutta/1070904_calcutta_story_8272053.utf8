 Protestor thrown off bus 

 - Woman devotees harassed by youths, passengers silent

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Sheikh Abul Ehshan, 28, was severely beaten up and thrown off a private bus on Sunday evening after he protested against some youths who were allegedly disturbing several women devotees on their way to the shrine of Loknathbaba in Kachua.

 Ehshan was admitted to Barasat district hospital and is in a critical condition. 

 We have arrested Madhu Gharami from Kadambagachhi and are looking for the others involved in the incident, said S. Chakrabarty, the officer-in-charge of Barasat police station.

 The incident took place around 7.30pm when Ehshan, a garment trader, was returning home to Kadambagachhi by a Basirhat-bound bus. 

 Ehshan saw some youths teasing and passing lewd comments at some women, said his brother Abul Hossain. 

 The women were pilgrims on the way to Kachua. My brother watched the woman being harassed by the youths for some time. He intervened when two of the men tried to molest the women taking advantage of the crowd in the bus.

 Hossain added: Ehshan asked the youths to behave properly but they continued to harass the women. He tried to get the other passengers to protest but to no avail.

 Soon the youths started beating Ehshan up. He was punched several times on the nose. They banged his head against the iron handles before throwing him out near Dharmatala in Barasat, said Hossain. 

 None of the other passengers protested. Even the conductors did not help Ehshan. 

 Ehshan, who was bleeding profusely, managed to call his residence before losing consciousness on the road.

 We arrived at the spot and with the help of a few policemen took him to Barasat District Hospital, said Jasmin Biwi, Ehshans wife.

 Hossain later lodged a complaint with Barasat police station.

 The women devotees have not been traced.

 - Tourists offered array of destinations

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 From virgin beaches to a ride on a luxury train, the city tourist will soon be spoilt for choice. Officials from the tourism boards of several countries and states are in town, promoting their destinations at the ongoing Travel and Tourism Fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium.

 Calcutta is now looked upon as a major market by various tourism boards, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

 The tourism board of Indonesia has targeted 12 markets, including India, this year, said Thamrin B. Bachri, the director-general (marketing) in the ministry of culture and tourism, Indonesia.

 Though Indian tourists mostly visit Bali, we are promoting some lesser-known destinations like Lombok, Medan, Brastagi, Toba Lake and Palembang, he added.

 Mauritius is another preferred destination of tourists from eastern India and the number of tourists flying over has increased by over 30 per cent after the introduction of the Emirates flight from Calcutta, said Rajeev Nangia, the associate director (operations) of Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority.

 Closer home, Bengal is the biggest market, along with Gujarat, for the Uttarakhand tourism board. Prakash Pant, the tourism minister of Uttarakhand, said: We are focussing on yoga, meditation, adventure tourism and wildlife tourism. Adventure tourism is particularly aimed at attracting foreign tourists. We have introduced online booking.

 Uttarakhand is the biggest participant of all states in the fair.

 Down South, one can also look forward to a luxury train ride on The Golden Chariot, modelled on the Palace on Wheels, from Bangalore to Goa. It is set to roll off in November, said C. Somasekhara, the director in the department of tourism, Karnataka. Its 18 coaches will cater to all the requirements of the tourists.

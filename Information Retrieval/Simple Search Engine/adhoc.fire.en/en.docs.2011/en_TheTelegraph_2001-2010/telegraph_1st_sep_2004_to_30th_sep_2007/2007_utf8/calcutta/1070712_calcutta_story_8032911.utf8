 The civic authorities have taken up schemes to overhaul the sewers in the Free School Street, Samshul Huda Road, Madan Mohan Burman Street and Rani Rashmoni Road areas.

 Work will start immediately, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Wednesday. The total investment in the overhaul schemes will be more than Rs 7 crore, said a civic official.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and the municipal commissioner met civic engineers on Wednesday to find out what was preventing them from checking waterlogging in the city. We need a permanent solution to the problem of waterlogging, said the mayor.

 According to the engineers, a number of problems, specific to each of the streets, contributed to the waterlogging following the downpour on July 3.

 Lindsay Street and Sudder Street were inundated as the sewer under Free School Street was not functional, said an engineer.

 If the conduit under Rani Rashmoni Road had worked to capacity, SN Banerjee Road would not have suffered waterlogging, he added.

 The excessive waterlogging on Darga Road and Congress Exhibition Road, in Park Circus, is being attributed to heavy siltation in the sewer below Samshul Huda Road.

 Work on a bypass sewer for the Madan Mohan Burman Street area will start after the Puja, said a civic official. We will also try to create a new sewer below the pavements of Bidhan Sarani.

 According to the scheme, the sewage of Madan Mohan Burman Street will be diverted into the underground sewer of APC Road, via Vivekananda Road, before it reaches the underground sewer of Bidhan Sarani.

 The drainage revamp was finalised after a series of surveys carried out by the civic engineers.

 Presidency College: On the boil. A Telegraph picture

 After Singur and Nandigram, industrialisation and land acquisition have chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees alma mater Presidency College on the boil.

 Independent Consolidation (IC), which has been controlling the Presidency students union since 2003, is highlighting the issues to persuade students to vote against SFI candidates in the college elections, scheduled on Tuesday.

 A number of past and current members of IC have been actively involved in the movements against the governments policies in Singur and Nandigram. Some of them have also been arrested during demonstrations against the government.

 We are against the governments industrialisation and land acquisition policies and felt it necessary to focus on the issues in our election campaign.We are confident that the majority of students are against the policies and will vote in favour of IC candidates, said general secretary of the union Sayantan Saha Roy.

 According to SFI students, land acquisition and industrialisation are not appropriate issues for fighting the colleges students union elections.

 The IC-led union has been in power for the last three terms. But they have hardly contributed to the improvement of students facilities in the college, said Pushan Das, president of Presidencys SFI unit.

 Presidency has been chosen among the finest academic institutions in the country. Our primary concern is to ensure its all-round development. Industrialisation and land acquisition are non-issues in the election, he added.

 The immediate needs of the college, said SFI supporters, are administrative autonomy, a common placement cell, improvement in security arrangement on the campus, upgrade in library facilities and expansion of the campus. We have clarified our stand to the students, said Das.

 Among the SFI candidates are first-year students Saptarshi Deb, son of state minister for housing development Goutam Deb, and Hiya Mukherjee, daughter of tourism minister Manab Mukherjee.

 For the first time in the history of the college, SFI secured control over the union in 2001. It won the elections the following year as well. Former CPM party secretary Anil Biswass daughter Ajanta and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees daughter Suchetana were students of the college then.

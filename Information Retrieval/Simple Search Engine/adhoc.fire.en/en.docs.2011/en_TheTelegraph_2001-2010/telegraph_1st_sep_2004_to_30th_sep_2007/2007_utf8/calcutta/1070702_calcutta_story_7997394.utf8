 Folk entertainment

 As part of its ongoing initiative to promote cultural heritage, Hutchison Telecom East Ltd hosts Odeon 2007, a festival showcasing folk and contemporary forms of popular performing arts. On the cards this evening is a colourful Chhau dance presentation (picture right) followed by Baul songs. Chhau, Indias only masked dance, is a folk style of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Depicting enormous energy and vitality in its performance, Chhau is one of Indias most vibrant, pulsating folk art forms, which perennially inspires modern drama. Later, Gautam Das Baul will present Baul songs, an age-old yet powerful musical tradition of Bengal. Using instruments like ektara and gupi yantra, he will express the diverse, profound and esoteric strains of Baul philosophy and thought in typical fresh, light and lucid style.

 Event: Chhau dance and Baul performance When: Today; 5.30 pm amp; 6.30 pm Where: Nandan premises

 Bus conductor, aka brute

 A STAFF REPORTER

 College teacher Tapas Narayan Roy is not the only one to have suffered at the hands of a bus conductor. Several meet with his fate every day.

 Roy, of Rammohan College, was injured after he was thrown off a running bus, on route 78/1, by one of its conductors. The teacher had dared to protest rash driving and asked the conductor, Tarak Guha, to halt the bus at a designated stop. Guha has been held and charged with attempted murder.

 On May 10, Sujata Sinha, a Class XII student of Loreto Bowbazar, boarded a bus on route 237 while returning home from school. She wanted to get down in front of the Ultadanga bridge, a designated stop. But the bus, in a hurry to beat others on the route, did not stop there. 

 Sujata had to get down at the next stop, Lake Town. Her repeated pleas to the conductor to halt the bus at the Ultadanga bridge earned her a volley of abuse.

 In July, Jagannath Dey, a hotel management student, stood up to a gang teasing a woman on a bus in Salt Lake. He was beaten up by the harassers. The conductor, instead of coming to his rescue, forced him to get off.

 The Bus Workers Association blames rash driving on the commission system of payment fixed by the owners. The more the passengers on a bus, the more the income of the driver and conductors.

 Thanks to the system, the conductors are at times forced to instruct drivers to speed up, said Bani Duttagupta, the secretary of the Citu-affiliated association.

 Swarnakamal Saha, the president of Bengal Bus Syndicate, an association of bus owners, differed with Duttagupta. We always ask conductors to be careful about the commuters comfort and safety. The incidents are isolated ones.

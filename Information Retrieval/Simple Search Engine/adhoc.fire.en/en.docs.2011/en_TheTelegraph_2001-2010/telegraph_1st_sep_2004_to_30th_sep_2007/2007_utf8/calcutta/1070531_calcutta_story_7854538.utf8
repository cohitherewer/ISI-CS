The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fire at market

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Memories of the December 1985 fire that gutted over 400 shops in New Market came alive on Wednesday evening after some traders and civic officials spotted smoke billowing out of the window of Shop No. N2/113 in the new complex. 

 Panic gripped the area as traders rushed out of their stores after the flames were noticed around 9.10pm.

 It was madness, as power supply was snapped after the fire. Everyone was running through the dark, narrow alleys to save the valuables in their stores, said Taher, a trader.

 As six fire tenders rushed to the spot, the flames were doused before they could cause large-scale damage. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay supervised the 30-minute operation.

 It would have taken lesser time had the fire brigade personnel come armed with gas cutters. Some of us had to break open the shutters to enter the shop, said a New Market trader.

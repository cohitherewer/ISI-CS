 Jail inmates on education quest

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 A class in progress for inmates at Alipore Central Correctional Home 

 After spending years behind bars and with more time left to serve, Akhtar Ali, Bhagabat Hansda and Tapan Bauri have found a purpose in life. They are learning to read and write, thanks to classes started at Alipore Central Correctional Home as part of a government initiative.

 The three are not exceptions. Nearly 40 per cent of the 3,900-plus convicts in the state correctional homes are illiterate. Many of them have taken to the correctional home classes with zest.

 Helping the students are lifers like Asoke Chakraborty, Yusuf Gayen and Bangshinath Gayen of Alipore Central Correctional Home, who used to teach before they were convicted. Members of voluntary organisations and the staff of correctional homes also chip in with instructions. 

 The classes are held regularly. We try to ensure that no convict is denied a basic education. So far, we have been successful, said inspector-general (prisons) B.D. Sharma.

 Jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury, too, was all praise for the initiative. Members of the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama of Malda, Udayini Social Action Forum of the city and Don Bosco Prison Ministry of Behrampore, and anganwadi workers are conducting the classes, said the minister.

 The eagerness of the inmates to learn has taken us by surprise. An inmate whose mother tongue is Hindi has learnt to write Bengali, stated superintendent of Alipore Central jail Ranjit Mondal. 

 Inmates Uttam Guria and Gopal Ghosh will appear for Madhyamik. Utthan Pal, a lifer, will write his MA papers in political science. I have advised him to study law after MA, added Mondal.

 The learners are provided books and stationery under the central literacy programme or by the district magistrate.

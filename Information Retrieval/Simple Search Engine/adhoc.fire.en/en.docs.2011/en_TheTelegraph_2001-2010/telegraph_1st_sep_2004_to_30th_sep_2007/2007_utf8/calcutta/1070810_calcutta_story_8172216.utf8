 Tsunami aid pilfer outrages churches

 OUR BUREAU

 The storm over the alleged misappropriation of tsunami funds by some officials of the Church of North Indias Calcutta diocese will hit the streets on Friday.

 Members of 27 churches under the diocese alleged on Thursday that a section of officials had misused Rs 22 lakh donated by students and guardians of 27 city schools for tsunami relief.

 To protest the scam, members of Peoples Synod, a city-based organisation of Christians, will assemble in front of Bishop House on Friday and demand the removal of bishop of the diocese P.S.P. Raju.

 Bishop Raju was not available for comment on the allegations levelled by the Peoples Synod.

 The uproar comes a day after the diocese suspended the director of an NGO, backed by the Church of North India, for misappropriating funds meant for tsunami relief in the Andamans.

 London-based Methodist Relief and Development Fund, a British donor agency, has accused Calcutta Urban Society (CUS) of misappropriating a Rs 3-crore grant for tsunami relief work. Bishop Raju heads the board of CUS.

 We are shocked with the way a section of diocese officials has misappropriated funds donated by the British donor agency and also by schools for tsunami relief. This has hurt the entire Christian community of Calcutta. The guilty must be punished, said Dipak Kumar Nath, the convener of Peoples Synod.

 Nath alleged that Rs 22 lakh had been collected in cash from students and guardians of prominent schools, like La Martiniere, St Thomas, St James and Pratt Memorial.

 It is shocking how funds donated for the purpose of providing shelter to the homeless after such a calamity can be misappropriated is such a manner, said members of Peoples Synod.

 According to them, some diocese officials were also planning to surreptitiously transfer a large property belonging to the Church of North India on Elgin Road to a developer.

 We will launch a movement against such illegal transfer of church property for personal gains, said Reverend Sailesh Mukhopadhyay of Peoples Synod.

 A similar protest movement was witnessed in 2004, when a large number of church members had demonstrated to stop the transfer of Bishop House, on Chowringhee, to a developer.

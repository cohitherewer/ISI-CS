 Natural compositions

 The tradition of landscape painting in Indian art, as found in ancient cave and medieval miniature paintings, has come a long way. The onset of the 20th century witnessed the beginning of a trend in which landscapes came to be painted for their own sake, rather than as an environment to a poetic subject. Landscape in Modern Paintings, the ongoing group exhibition of works by eminent artists, attempts to understand the stylistic impulses as well as the diverse grace and grandeur of contemporary landscape painting. Participants include Dhirendra Krishna Deb Barman, Gopal Ghose, Indra Dugar, Satyen Ghosal, Kartick Chandra Pyne, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Shyamasree Basu, Manu Parekh, and Malay Chandan Saha (a painting by him appears right). Curated by Prasanta Daw.

 Event: Paintings by renowned artists When: Till May 15; 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Aakriti Art Gallery, 1st floor, 12/3A Hungerford Street

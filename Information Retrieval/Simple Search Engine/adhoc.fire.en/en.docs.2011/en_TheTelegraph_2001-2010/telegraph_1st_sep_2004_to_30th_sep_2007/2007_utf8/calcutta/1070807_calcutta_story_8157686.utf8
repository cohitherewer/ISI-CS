 HDFC Bank has joined hands with Icfai Business School, Calcutta, to launch a course in relationship management as part of the MBA programme.

 The two organisations signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday to offer the joint certificate programme at the Sector V institute. It will be an additional elective subject.

 My colleagues and I have been teaching at various institutes as visiting faculty. But this is the first time the bank, as an institution, is offering a course. It will enable students to get an industry view of relationship management, said Philip Matthew, the senior vice-president (human resources) of HDFC Bank.

 The module will be spread over 30 to 40 hours and include classroom lessons plus case studies and on-the-job training. The course has been designed and developed jointly by HDFC Bank and Icfai Business School, Calcutta.

 This course will give students on-the-job experience, which will be a value addition, said Santanu Ray, the director of the B-school. 

 He expects the tie-up to be beneficial to all concerned. We are looking at HDFC as a research partner and hope to develop case studies on best practices with the bank, he added.

 Apart from facilitating certification, HDFC will organise guest lectures and workshops for students. The bank will also train faculty identified by the institute.

 HDFC has even decided to organise field trips for the students.

 Those who opt for the elective course will be interviewed for openings at HDFC Bank during final placements. The bank will enjoy the right to interview and select the B-school students who have completed the module first.

 The students will gain through industry exposure. We will benefit by getting industry-ready professionals, stated Matthew, highlighting the advantages of such a course.

 The students will not have to pay an extra amount over the MBA course fee to study relationship management. The module will be on offer from the next semester.

 Plea for script copy

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The re-assessment of Higher Secondary (HS) answer scripts by a Calcutta High Court judge has prompted advocate Supradip Roy to file a petition that the HS council issue photocopies of answer scripts with marksheets.

 The council is claiming that the Supreme Court had upheld its decision not to re-assess the answer scripts of any aggrieved student. But in 2003, a division bench of Calcutta High Court had asked the council to ensure transparency in publication of results. This it failed to implement, advocate Roy asserted.

 The lawyer said in the past five years the court had observed several times that the process of publication of results and the method of scrutiny that the council follows were not up to the mark.

 The court had observed that the result publication system prevailing in the council for years should be changed, he claimed.

 The petitioner said an examination-conducting agency in Bangalore had achieved good results after deciding to issue photocopies of answer scripts along with the marksheet.

 A recent survey conducted in Bangalore has revealed that the rate of suicides by aggrieved students has declined significantly, he said.

 In West Bengal, too, some emotional students commit suicide each year after failing in school-leaving examinations. If the council could issue photocopies of the answer scripts along with marksheets, the rate of suicide will decline, the advocate asserted in his petition.

 The petition mentions that during the past three years, marks have increased in at least 30 cases when the answer scripts were brought to court for re-assessment. Not a single student should be made a victim of the system, stressed Roy.

 The petition is expected to come up for hearing next week.

 According to Roy, a large number of former school students and their guardians have voiced an interest in joining the case as added parties.

 Chaos on VIP Road

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Traffic to and from the airport along VIP Road came to a halt for more than two hours on Sunday as CPM activists welcomed their leaders to the inauguration of a local committee office near Baguiati AC market.

 Commuters waited helplessly in their vehicles as the processionists blocked the road to reach the venue.

 We were helpless, as our party members came in hordes to catch a glimpse of our leadership. However, it was the duty of police to maintain the traffic flow, said Subhajit Dasgupta, secretary of the partys local committee. 

 The cops refused comment.

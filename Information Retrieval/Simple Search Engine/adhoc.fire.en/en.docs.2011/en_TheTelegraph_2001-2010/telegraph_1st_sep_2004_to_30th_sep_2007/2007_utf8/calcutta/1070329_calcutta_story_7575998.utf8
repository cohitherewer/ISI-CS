 Dance with me

 Women filmmakers have carved a special niche for themselves in world cinema by virtue of their success in laying bare women-specific issues and problems related to gender discrimination. To be screened today as part of a film festival Look Back IIWFF, are three award-winning films by women directors that address social evils like abuse, oppression and persecution of women at various levels. Dunia (English title: Kiss Me Not On The Eyes; 3 pm), a film by Lebanese director Jocelyne Saab, enables the occidental and far-eastern spectator to lay new eyes on Arab society. Depicting the sensuality that runs underneath the surface of its highly traditional community, the film (a scene from it appears right) offers an interesting variation on the theme of desire and how it is expressed in individuals marked by a conservative education and upbringing. Having finished a degree in literature, Dunia, a young Egyptian woman, wishes to become a professional dancer. During a casting for an oriental dance contest, she meets the charming Pr Beshir. The latter is drawn to the young womans speech, as she dares speak of pleasure and the difficulties of being a woman in this society. In the film, Dunia will dance only after she discovers the sensuous pleasures of what she has already voiced in words. Also being screened today: Sleeping Child (dir: Yasmine Kessari, Belgium; 5 pm) and Wedding Dress (dir: Fiorcila Infascelli, Italy; 7 pm). Also, Reality amp; Beyond, a documentary (dir: S. Chatterjee, India; 6.30 pm).

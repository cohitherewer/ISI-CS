 Civic forum for feedback

 - Door-to-door response system from April after funds body prod

 What does it take to get the citys civic body to reach out to its citizens? A prod from a British government agency.

 The department for international development (DFID) has made sure that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) floats a feedback forum involving citizens in order to improve civic administration.

 The proposal of a door-to-door response system has already been passed in the mayoral council meeting and is expected to take shape from the next financial year starting in April, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 In Britain, the local authorities do not have to wait for people to tell them about their grievances. Londoners write to us on a wide range of subjects, said Tony Stewart, who works for the public liaison unit in the Greater London Assembly (GLA). 

 The GLA, headed by a very active mayor, Ken Livingstone, acts as an umbrella body for the local authorities in London who, in return for council tax paid by householders, provide a wide range of services from running schools to collecting rubbish, street cleaning, lighting and repairs. 

 On specific projects, the public is consulted. For example, the extension of the congestion charging zone in London.

 The consultation is being done by Transport for London, which has sent letters to all householders in west London, distributed leaflets and put up posters at bus shelters. 

 Once the feedback forum is in place, Calcutta would become the second Indian city after Bangalore to adopt such a system. The Bangalore model will be implemented here under the guidance of Public Affairs Foundation, based in the Karnataka capital, which will offer overarching support to the CMC, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 A report card prototype is being prepared. This will be something more than a survey since citizens will enjoy a privilege to express satisfaction or displeasure over the CMCs local activities, said Bandyopadhyay.

 People will have their say on the civic amenities they get and expect. Citizens can even contribute with innovative thoughts and suggestions to improve delivery of civic services.

 There is no place for complacency in running an institution like civic body and we welcome practical suggestions from the people. We are ready to reshape our policy accordingly for the betterment of the city and its citizens, stressed mayor Bhattacharyya.

 Specialised agencies will handle the process and record the peoples responses. They will submit regular reports to the CMC.

 In London, the GLA receives thousands of letters and emails every day. We are not a service provider but we reply to the letters and pass them on to the local authorities, explained Stewart.

 The CMCs move comes more than a year after it had, for the first time, published New Year Resolutions and given Calcuttans a glimpse of what to expect.

 Details of projects, expenses involved and expected dates of completion were declared so that people would be in a position to assess the CMCs achievements and failures. However, the progress report for 2006 turned out to be quite dismal, except in the road-repair sector.

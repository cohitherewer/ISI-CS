 A minibus crushed a 25-year-old youth under its wheels on Strand Road on Friday morning while overtaking a car and sped away. The man died on the spot.

 This was the third case of rash driving registered by police on three consecutive days, resulting in two deaths. 

 According to the police, Fridays mishap took place around 10am, when Govind Kumar Gandh was walking along Strand Road.

 The minibus ran over Gandh, a resident of Mint Colony, in the Taratala police station area, in front of the State Bank of India head office, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 The front wheels of the bus crushed the private firm employee, said witnesses. Pedestrians rushed to the spot but the driver managed to flee.

 A traffic constable took Gandh to Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Traffic movement was disrupted on the road for half an hour because of the mishap. Senior traffic officers visited the spot.

 The police said they were yet to trace the vehicle. We are contacting the depots and trying to find out the route on which the bus was plying. Once we have the information, we will go through the route schedule and track down the guilty driver, said Singh.

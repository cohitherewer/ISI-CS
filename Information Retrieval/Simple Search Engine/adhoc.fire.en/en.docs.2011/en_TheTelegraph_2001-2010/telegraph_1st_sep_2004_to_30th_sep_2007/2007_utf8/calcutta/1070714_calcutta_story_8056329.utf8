 Curb-hotels cry to save Memorial

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 An environment institute has called for curbs on issuance of fresh licences to set up restaurants and hotels on Park Street and its adjoining areas to protect Victoria Memorial from air pollution.

 A policy of restricted permits for new installations (which would use cleaner fuels and take proper pollution control measures) around the monument is suggested, National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has said in its report, placed in the high court on Friday.

 The institute has also recommended restrictions on traffic, especially old commercial vehicles, around the monument. It suggested a ban on public gatherings near the Memorial and creation of a stronger green buffer zone around it.

 In response to an earlier order of the court, the Victoria Memorial authorities on Friday placed the report before a division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice R.N. Banerjee.The court is yet to make a statement on the report.

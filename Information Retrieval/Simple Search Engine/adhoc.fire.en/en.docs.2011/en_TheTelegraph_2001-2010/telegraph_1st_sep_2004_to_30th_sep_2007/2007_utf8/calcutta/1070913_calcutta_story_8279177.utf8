 Slums in land knot

 - Mayor wants plot handover for upgrade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The 5,000-odd slums in the city will never benefit from any urban renewal initiative unless the land they occupy is handed over to the civic authorities, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has said.

 The slum land has been classified as thika land (owned by the government) and the residents pay rent to the controller of thika tenancy.

 The civic body has plans to construct houses for slum-dwellers, either with funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission or in association with private developers.

 But the primary condition for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to take up any housing project in the slums is that the land should belong to it. Despite my repeated pleas to the government, there has been no attempt to handover the thika land to the CMC, rued Bhattacharyya.

 The slums are spread across 10,000 bighas of prime land in the city. The mayor expressed concern that the mushrooming of illegal constructions in the slums is making it difficult for the civic body to take up any upgrade scheme.

 If the land issue is not resolved soon, the slums will be grabbed by illegal promoters and the CMC will not be in a position to take up housing schemes there, said a senior civic official.

 Mayoral council member (slum improvement) Abu Sufiyan said the civic body is also planning to improve basic amenities in the slums. His department has prepared a Rs 100-crore drainage scheme for the slum areas, which will be taken up with funds from the national urban renewal mission.

 Taking a dig at the mayors concern for the slums, Opposition leader in the civic body Javed Ahmed Khan (Trinamul Congress) said: The CPM will never undertake any real development scheme for the slums. It fears losing support of the slum-dwellers if their living condition improves.

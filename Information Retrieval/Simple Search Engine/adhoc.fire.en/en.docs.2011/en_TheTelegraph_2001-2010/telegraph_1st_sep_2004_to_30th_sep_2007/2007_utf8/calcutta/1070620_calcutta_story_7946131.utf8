 Fresh rap for HS scripts

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday asked the Higher Secondary (HS) council to produce the science answer scripts of a student to verify the marks. 

 Debapriya Sengupta, a student of Laban Hrad Vidyapith, failed in all her science subjects in the HS exam this year.

 She got a rank of 1,700 in the Joint Entrance Examination and scored 70 per cent in the pre-test and test examinations in the school. 

 She has secured pass marks in the other two subjects, English and Bengali. 

 Debapriyas father Debotosh Sengupta, a resident of Salt Lake, moved a petition before the high court after he was dissatisfied with the marks.

 A lot of students perform well in the entrance examination but get poor marks in HS. We have got a lot of petitions like this, said Subrata Mukhopaddhyaya, junior standing counsel and the lawyer for JEE board. 

 All the petitions will come up for hearing before the high court, he added.

 Sources said that Debapriya had got 72 marks in physics, 75 in chemistry, 79 in mathematics and 70 in biology in her tests. 

 But in her HS exams, she got 20 in physics, 29 in chemistry, 30 in mathematics and 30 in biology.

 She has got 78 per cent in mathematics in JEE. She scored 69 in English and 64 in Bengali in the HS exams. How can she fail only in the science subjects? asked defence lawyer Biswarup Bhattacharya.

 He added that Debapriya had been an excellent student. It is unbelievable that she could secure such poor marks in the HS exams, claimed the lawyer.

 After the hearing, Justice Biswanath Somadder asked the HS council to produce the answer scripts on June 26. 

 The judge also asked the school authorities to submit Debapriyas test examination answer scripts.

 This is not the first time that the high court has asked the HS council to produce the answer scripts of a student for verification.

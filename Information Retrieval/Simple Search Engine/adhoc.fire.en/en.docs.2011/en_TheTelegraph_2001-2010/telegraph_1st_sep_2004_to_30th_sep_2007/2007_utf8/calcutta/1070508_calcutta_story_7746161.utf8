 Biz-match deal inked

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Indo-American Chamber of Commerce in the eastern region signed a joint alliance with the World Trade Center-Rhode Island on Monday.

 Dennis McCarthy, managing director of World Trade Center, Rhode Island, and regional president of the chamber S.K. Jain exchanged signatures at the Bengal Club. 

 A business-matching programme between the countries is the key part of the new alliance. The alliance is intended to provide an effective platform for business and trade between India and the US. 

 One of the primary benefits for India will be easy access to business contacts in 130 countries that have a World Trade Center branch, Jain disclosed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hi-tech crime vs .303

 PRONAB MONDAL

 A 10-year-old Ambassador here, a brand new SUV there; the old and trusted .303 rifle here, the latest assault rifles there; a team of 13 men here, a team of more than 100 there. 

 The Special Operations Group (SOG), responsible for countering high-profile crimes in Calcutta, is facing a severe resource crunch. 

 That is the crux of a recent missive from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to the state government.

 Highlighting how the SOG lags behind its counterparts like the Special Task Force (STF) in Uttar Pradesh, Grey Hound in Andhra Pradesh and Crime Branch in Mumbai in terms of manpower and other resources, the CID has also submitted a set of proposals to the government. 

 We take the same risk, handle the same amount of stress and tackle the same type of crimes but lag behind in every other respect. The citys link with the militants has been proven several times, but we are not equipped to handle such crimes, said an SOG official in the Bhawani Bhavan headquarters of the outfit, which was set up in 1998. 

 The SOG has probed cases like abduction of shoe baron Partha Pratim Roy Burman and murder of doctors Chandan Sen and Sushil Pal. The members of the unit also track down terrorists. They have arrested more than a dozen Bangladeshi criminals, including those wanted by Interpol, over the past two months.

 In the letter, the CID called for structural development of SOG by providing it more manpower, sophisticated weapons and high-speed vehicles. The top brass forwarded the data provided by their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, Mumbai, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh to the state home department. 

 We are working under difficult circumstances. Ideally, the best officers should be in our team but not even one young and intelligent policeman is showing interest in joining the SOG. On the contrary, those in the unit are planning to quit, said an officer.

 The cops feel that the low salary is a vital factor. Our counterparts in other cities earn upto Rs 8,000 more than us every month. Besides, they have a special life insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh, said the officer.

 A group of three SOG officers recently visited the STFs office in Lucknow. They found a team of 138 policemen, all armed with sophisticated pistols and rifles of AK series. At least 20 new cars were ready in the parking lot for the policemen to move quickly.

 We saw some officers carrying two cellphones. One is for calls from their superiors and the other is for calls from their sources. We find it difficult to maintain a single cellphone because the authorities dont pay the bill, said another SOG officer.

 The trio also became the butt of jokes when they ran short of money after three days.

 An STF official asked them whether they were spending more time managing the dwindling funds than investigating cases.

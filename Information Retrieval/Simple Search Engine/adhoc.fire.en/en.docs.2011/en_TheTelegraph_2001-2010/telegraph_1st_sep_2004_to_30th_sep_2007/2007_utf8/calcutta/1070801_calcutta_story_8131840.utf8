The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cry for ban on film

 MLA Barry OBrien demanded

 in the Assembly on Tuesday that Anjan Dutts Bow

 Barracks Forever (a

 still from the film) be banned unless it carries

 a statement saying that the film is a work of fiction

 and bears no resemblance to anyone. The Anglo-Indian

 community has been shown in a poor light. The storyline

 about landsharks trying to grab Bow Barracks is far

 from the truth, said OBrien. Three key voices in

 the debate.

 Director Anjan Dutt: The story of Bow Barracks Forever is fictional. I celebrated the love and respect I have for those people in the film.

 Producer Pritish Nandy: There is nothing wrong in the representation of facts in the film. If there is an issue regarding insertion of such a line, I will fight my case but will do nothing under pressure from a politician.

 Bruce Lindsay, vice-president of Bow United Organisation: We had earlier decided to name our new complex Bow Barracks Forever, inspired by the film. But we were very disappointed after watching the movie and decided to rename it Bow Barracks Enclave. The spirit of Bow Barracks is missing in the film.

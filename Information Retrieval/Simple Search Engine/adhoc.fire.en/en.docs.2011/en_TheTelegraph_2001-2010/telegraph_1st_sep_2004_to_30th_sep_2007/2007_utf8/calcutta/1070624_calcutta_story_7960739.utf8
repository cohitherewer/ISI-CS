 Working marriage

 The matrimonial market has its ways of dealing with professional women, report Poulomi Banerjee and Shabina Akhtar

 He has many reservations. Women may be changing the gender ratio in all job sectors significantly, but some of the top jobs like a womans dark complexion are not allowed in the marriage market. 

 Relations, an ISO 9001 2000 certified marriage bureau, maintains a file of the blacklisted professions.

 Journalists top the list. This is because people have certain preconceived notions about journalists. They are thought to have irregular hours and people also think that all journalists smoke and drink, says Anindya Sanyal of Relations.

 Other professionals who do not fare well, says Sanyal, especially because of erratic work hours, include lawyers, doctors, policewomen and BPO employees. Credit card companies and personal loan agencies also look down upon journalists and lawyers. The marriage and money sectors always had a lot in common. 

 Says Soumendu Sen of marriage bureau Astha: Women in the IT sector face some difficulty because of their irregular working hours. So do lawyers. With journalists, one has to be careful, because they too are more demanding in their choice than others. 

 He adds: But in most cases more than the outright rejection of a profession, problem starts later. Men want their brides to accept their decision on whether they should work after marriage. Whether she will move with him in case of a transfer is also a question. 

 Om Prakash Hassanandani, business head, ShaadiPoint, the offline bureau of Shaadi.com, feels that the question of jobs depends on the community. Marathis and Bengalis prefer a working woman, who is also a little homely, where as Punjabis want housewives. Marathis prefer women in government jobs, Marawaris prefer a woman who has a small business of her own. 

 A media employee, who got married a year ago, recounts her experience. The broadminded grooms families would be first impressed by her profession. Then they would meet me for a second time when the guy would ask how serious I was about a career or whether I will consider taking up something with more conventional hours, she says.

 One person asked me whether I wouldnt be missing out on life when I came home and found my husband and kids already in bed. He also demanded to know who would help with the childrens homework, if I was not at home in the evenings, she laughs. 

 So though the ruling party at the Centre is headed by a woman, a woman President looks set to take over and Indra Nooyi is already looking after Pepsi, the profession for a bride that is most desired in the marriage market is of teaching, a womans traditional job.

 A teacher is most in demand when it comes to brides, says Sen. School teachers are more in demand than college lecturers. That is because schools are more in number, and the bride can work at a school near home. The salary is good and there are many holidays and vacations, says Sen.

 The jobs that might go against a woman make a man more desirable and vice versa. For women, IT employees and MBAs are the coveted professions in a husband. The common refrain of the bureaus is that no one wants teachers or government employees any more as grooms.

 There has also been a resurgence in the number of men who want a stay-at-home wife. Men would prefer a working woman because double income was thought to be a necessity. After 2005, there was a reversal. An MBA or an IT professionals earn so well that they prefer someone who will stay at home laughs Sanyal of Relations.

 Beauty test

 But all such considerations are secondary. For women the first test to pass remains the one of beauty. Beauty is the first thing that a man asks for, says A. Sengupta of Ekanto Apon, a marriage bureau. And dark is still not fair. Dusky actresses may be redifining the parameters of beauty in the glamour industry, but the groom and his parents are united in their desire for a fair and lovely bride, says Sen. Bipasha Basu would have found it difficult to get married. 

 Men still go for looks and fair complexion, says Murugaval Janakiram, CEO, BharatMatrimony. The times have changed, the demands remain the same. 

 I have the grooms family saying with pride that they dont have any demand. As if they are obliging the bride and her family by not asking for a dowry, says Sanyal.

 Caste rigidities remain. We even have a Search by Horoscope feature for members for whom horoscope matching is very important, says Vibhash Mehta, business head, Shaadi.com, a wedding portal.

 No wonder all marriage bureaus, online or off-line, are doing well, and so is arranged marriage. Our business dropped by 45 per cent when online marriage portals started, but in the last two years we have recovered, says Sanyal.

 He also feels that love marriages are on the decline. Arranged marriages have made a glorious return. The number of arranged marriages has gone up by 50 per cent in the past two years.

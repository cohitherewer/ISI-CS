 A recent report by a central institute has corroborated earlier findings that the air around the Maidan, while it was being mauled by the Book Fair last year, was pure poison.

 The report, by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, points out that the average suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (RPM) levels in the air around Victoria Memorial during Book Fair 2006 were 465 and 282 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively.

 The permissible limits for the two key pollutants are 200 and 100. In sensitive zones, such as the area around Victoria Memorial, they are even less 100 and 75.

 If such was the state of the ambient air at Victoria Memorial, think of the pollution levels at the fairground, said green activist Subhas Dutta, who has a copy of the report that was submitted to the high court. The pollution control board had pointed out that such high levels of pollutants could prove fatal for children and the aged.

 In 2001, the board had detected alarmingly high concentration of RPM at the fairground. While the average figure was 611, the highest was 1,316.

 But the board stated in the court early this year that the fair on the Maidan was not much of an environmental hazard. The court rejected the argument and ordered the fair to be shifted from the citys lungs.

 Tridib Chatterjee, of Publishers and Booksellers Guild, the organisers of the fair, said: We are not insisting on organising the fair on the Maidan. This years venue the lawns of the Salt Lake stadium was unacceptable to us. We want a better venue.

 The organisers had written to the army brass, seeking permission to hold the fair next year on the precious patch of green in the heart of the city. Following the armys denial of permission, they approached the chief ministers private secretary, Sailesh Mukherjee.

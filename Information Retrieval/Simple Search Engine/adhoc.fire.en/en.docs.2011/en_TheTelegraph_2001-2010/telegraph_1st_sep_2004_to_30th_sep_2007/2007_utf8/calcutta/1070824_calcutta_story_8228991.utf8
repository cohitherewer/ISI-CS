 The high court on Thursday directed the Alipore chief judicial magistrate (CJM) to issue non-bailable arrest warrants against the two accused in the 1999 Oxytown murder case, Lakshmi Narayan Chakraborty and Chandan Das.

 The CJM is directed to ask the administration to attach their properties if police fail to arrest them within a month, ruled the division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice Arun Kumar Bhattacharya.

 In March, a trial court had acquitted Chakraborty and Das of charges of murdering the four members of a family in Oxytown, Thakurpukur.

 Following an appeal by the state government against the acquittal, the division bench of justices Talukdar and Bhattacharya had ordered the duo to surrender in Alipore court within a week. That was a fortnight ago and the accused have since been absconding. The high court had also ordered the police to arrest the two if they did not surrender.

 Public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami submitted before the division bench on Friday that the accused had flouted the high courts order by not surrendering before the trial court. The police, too, have failed to arrest them.

 The bench then ordered the CJM to issue non-bailable arrest warrants against the duo.

 The police claim Chakraborty, a schoolteacher, and Das, an alleged contract killer, had murdered Bidyut Pal, 55, wife Manjulika, 51, and their daughters Sohini, 22, and Triparna, 16, on June 9, 1999. 

 The bodies were recovered five days later.

 Chakraborty, who lived next-door to the Pals, reportedly had an affair with his student Sohini and decided to wipe out the family after she pressed him to marry her.

 The two would have been granted bail had they surrendered in Alipore court. But todays order has ruled out that possibility, said a legal expert.

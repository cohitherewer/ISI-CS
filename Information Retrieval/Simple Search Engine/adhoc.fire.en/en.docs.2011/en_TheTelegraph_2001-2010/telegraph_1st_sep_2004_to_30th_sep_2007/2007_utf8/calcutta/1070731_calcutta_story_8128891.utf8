The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Two weeks time for South City

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Girish Gupta, on Monday gave the South City authorities two weeks to respond to the charges levelled against them by the state government.

 Carrying out an earlier order of the high court, a team of land experts had visited the project site on Prince Anwar Shah Road and filed a report on November 17 last year. The state land department alleged in its report that the authorities of the housing-cum-trade complex project, had illegally filled up a waterbody of .04 acres. The team had recommended that the authorities of the project be asked to return the waterbody.

 On Monday, the lawyers appearing for South City prayed for time to respond to the state governments allegations. The court fixed the hearing of the case on August 14.

 Trinamul Congress councillor Javed Khan had filed the case against South City. He had challenged the Calcutta Municipal Corporations nod for the project.

 The authorities did not obtain a no-objection certificate from the central pollution board, Khan had alleged.

 On the basis of the complaint, the high court had ordered the state pollution control board and the state government to visit the site and file reports.

 Both the government and the board had stated that the project authorities had violated environmental norms by converting the waterbody.

 Vagaries of memory

 As part of the ongoing retrospective of films by French director Alain Resnais (picture right; behind camera), being screened this evening is his third feature film Muriel ou Le temps dun retour (1963). A film about obscure, painful memories, it demands that we endure its theatricality and embalmed atmosphere in order to reflect, along with Resnais, about various kinds of unbearable pasts, personal and national. The city of Boulogne is itself a character in Muriel, rebuilt and unrecognisable after the bombings of World War II. Antique dealer Hlne, whose home is her gallery, lives in a jumble of distant French pasts, all the better to avoid her own. The home movie sequence in the film is one of the few in French cinema of the 1960s where the Algerian War has been depicted. However, one can see happy soldiers hanging out here, while the voice-over of Hlnes stepson recounts the rape and torture of the Algerian woman named in the title. Daring, in light of French censorship of any text that compromised state security during the Algerian situation, the film leaves the viewer with more questions than resolutions. Hosted by The French Association.

 Event: Retrospective of films by Alain Resnais When: Today at 6 pm Where: The French Association library

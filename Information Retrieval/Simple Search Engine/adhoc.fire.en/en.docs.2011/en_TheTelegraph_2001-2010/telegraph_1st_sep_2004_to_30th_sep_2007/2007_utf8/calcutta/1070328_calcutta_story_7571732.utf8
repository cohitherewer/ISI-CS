 A clutch of illegal settlers has made life difficult for residents of CIT Scheme 114A, in Lake Gardens, a stones throw from a mega showpiece housing estate coming up. The most affected are the ones who live on the southern and western sides of CIT Park.

 The residents have appealed to the authorities including the pollution control board, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and Calcutta Improvement Trust several times to evict the squatters, but in vain.

 Local MLA Kshiti Goswami, who is also PWD minister, urged the residents to endure the hardship for some more time, till the government identified a site to relocate the squatters.

 Residents said the settlers light up coal-fire ovens close to their plastic sheet shanties about 150 of which have come up there posing a fire hazard. They have also encroached on a key road in the locality, turning it into an accident-prone thoroughfare.

 Several of the settlers are rag-pickers. They dump plastic and other waste in front of the houses of the residents, causing environment pollution. To make matters worse, they relieve themselves in the open.

 Some residents complained that alcohol and drug abuse is rampant in the settlers colony.

 We do not protest the settlers activities, fearing attacks, said a resident of the locality. Those who had dared to protest were assaulted by the squatters. Even senior citizens were not spared. Police neither came to our rescue nor tried to rein in the settlers.

 The park in the neighbourhood turns into a criminals den after sundown, complained another resident.

 MLA Goswami (RSP) admitted that the situation was disturbing. I feel really bad for the residents. But they need to wait for some more time till we find a suitable place to relocate the squatters. I have also talked to the local councillor to keep the area clean, he said.

 Local councillor Ratan Dey (Trinamul Congress) said: We are trying our best to keep the area clean. If a resident makes a specific complaint, we will look into it.

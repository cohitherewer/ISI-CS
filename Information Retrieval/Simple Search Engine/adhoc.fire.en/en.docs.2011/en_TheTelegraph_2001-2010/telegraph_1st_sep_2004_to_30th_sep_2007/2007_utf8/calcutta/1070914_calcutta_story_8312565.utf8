 A question of faith

 Padatik presents Patton School One Act Play Competition based on the theme, Is my life, my life only? Teams from nine schools will be performing on stage. Each team has participated in a 10-day workshop at Padatik conducted by Shantanu Bose, an NSD graduate, and Ekavli Khanna, a theatre expert. Each performance shall focus on the search for identity that is an essential part of growing up. With emotional tumult and characteristic rebellion each one of us tries to adapt ourselves to changes within and without. In our times of deteriorating value systems, the question of priorities in life comes across as a major challenge. This is what each script will address by dwelling on issues universally relevant to the youth. Participating schools: Modern High School for Girls, La Martiniere for Boys, The Cambridge School, Apeejay School,Vivekananda Mission School, Calcutta International School, St.Augustines Day School, Ashok Hall Girls Higher Secondary School, and The Assembly of God Church School. Judges : Kunal Padhy, Zarin Chowdhury and Rohit Pombra.

 Event: An inter-school one-act play competition When: Today at 5.30 pm; tomorrow at 4.30 pm Where: Gyan Manch, 11 Pretoria Street

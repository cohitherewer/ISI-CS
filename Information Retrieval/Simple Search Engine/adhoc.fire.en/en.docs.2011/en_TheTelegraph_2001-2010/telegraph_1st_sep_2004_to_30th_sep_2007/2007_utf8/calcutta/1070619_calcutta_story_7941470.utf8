 Two days before Jamai Sashthi, Arindam Ghosh gave his father-in-law a rude shock by setting up an abduction drama and demanding Rs 15 lakh for his own release. 

 A few gaffes by the 27-year-old man, who claimed to be a techie, brought the curtains down on the 36-hour drama and he was arrested early on Monday on charges of cheating and hatching a conspiracy. His parents Swapan and Tapati have also been detained. 

 He told us that he planned the entire drama to squeeze money out of his rich father-in-law, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas). 

 But Ghoshs grand plans got punctured as he used his cellphone to make some of the ransom calls, which the cops traced, and picked him up from his friends house in Behala. 

 Claiming to be a computer engineer working in a Salt Lake software firm, Ghosh married Debashree Pal, daughter of Jhantu Krishna Pal, on January 22, 2006. 

 It took us less than six months to figure out that he had cheated all of us. He started borrowing money from my brother. He even sold the gold ornaments of Debashree, said Sushil Pal, Debashrees uncle, while his brother Jhantu Krishna was recuperating in a Salt Lake nursing home. 

 According to police, Ghosh scripted the abduction drama to pay for a flat in Baishnabghata and to invest in a business venture. 

 As planned, he left his Bakshi Bagan home in Behala on Saturday morning and called up his mother in the afternoon to inform her that he was going to the nursing home to meet his ailing father-in-law. 

 His mother received the first ransom call around 3.30pm on Saturday. Then she and her husband met the Pal family to discuss how to free their son, said an officer of Behala police station. 

 We asked them to get in touch with the police, said Sushil, recounting how the Ghosh couple insisted that the Pals pay up the ransom. 

 The Ghosh family lodged a complaint in Behala police station on Sunday morning. We took down the ransom call details and tracked Ghosh in a few hours, said the officer.

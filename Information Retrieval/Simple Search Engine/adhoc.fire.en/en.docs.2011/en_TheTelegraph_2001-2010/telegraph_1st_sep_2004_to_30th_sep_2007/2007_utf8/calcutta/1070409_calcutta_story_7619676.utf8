 The CIDs special cell, headed by a woman, has filed the chargesheet in a girl-trafficking case in record time.

 The racket was busted on February 16 with the arrest of a couple and five others, and the chargesheet was submitted in the chief judicial magistrates court on Saturday.

 A senior IPS officer said the speed with which the probe was conducted, under the leadership of deputy superintendent of police Niloo Sherpa, was unprecedented.

 The matter will come up for hearing next week. All seven accused are in judicial custody, the officer added.

 Acting on a tip-off, a 12-member team, led by a woman inspector, raided an apartment in Hossainpur, near Ruby General Hospital, and rescued three minor girls trafficked from Nepal. The trio was forced into prostitution a couple of years ago.

 The owner of the apartment, Soumen Acharya, was arrested on the charge of running the racket. Others held were Dulal Deb and wife Leena, Pintoo Mukherjee, Pradip Chowdhury, Ranjit Lal and Biswajit Deb.

 The racket was being run for quite some time, said an investigating officer. Acharya had converted the flat into a brothel and the rest brought in clients against a hefty commission. The girls were provided with food and pocket money. The clients included a few high-profile persons.

 The CID, in possession of enough documents, is hopeful of securing conviction for all seven. The sleuths had seized a register that has records of daily transactions at the apartment. A large number of contraceptives were seized from the flat, said an officer.

 UN tie-up: With the rise in trafficking of minor girls, the CID has tied up with the United Nations for upgrading its infrastructure and training officers to curb such crimes. Sanjay Mukherjee, deputy inspector-general (special), CID, recently completed his training at a UN office.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ex-govt official in PM letter scam net

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Former central government employee K.C. Chakraborty, 64, has been arrested in Delhi by a team from Calcutta polices detective department for issuing forged letters in the name of the Prime Minister and the President.

 Chakraborty worked for Regional Resource Development Organisation (RRDO) in Rajarhat, which had cheated clients of more than Rs 5 crore by promising loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard).

 Chakraborty has been brought to Calcutta. He will be produced in Bankshal court on Saturday, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner (detective department). 

 Chakraborty retired from service in 2005. He met officials of RRDO in Delhi and started working for them. He even used his contacts to obtain letters of endorsement from some legislators, said a sleuth.

 Officers of the special cell raided the RRDO office in August and arrested Partho Deb Roy, his wife Shivani, son Debojyoti and Saumitro Roy for allegedly cheating people using forged letters of endorsement from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. 

 We found the letters were forged when we contacted the offices of the Prime Minister and the President. Chakraborty also introduced the arrested four to senior central government employees. He said he was paid Rs 50 lakh for the job and owed another Rs 5 lakh from them, added the officer. 

 Partho and Debojyoti were directors of the company, while Shivani was the managing director and Saumitro, the CEO. Calcutta police had been on their trail since last year.

 The racket had been flourishing since 2005. A probe is on to find out whether anyone else was involved in it. The RRDO officials approached several firms and took 15 to 20 per cent of the loan amount sought in advance as the commission, said Kumar.

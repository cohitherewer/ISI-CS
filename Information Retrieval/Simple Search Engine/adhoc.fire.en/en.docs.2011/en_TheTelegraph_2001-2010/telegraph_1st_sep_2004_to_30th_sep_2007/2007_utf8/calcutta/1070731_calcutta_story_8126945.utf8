 Duo held on rape charge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two men in their mid-30s were arrested on Monday on charges of raping an 11-year-old in Maniktala. The arrest followed a complaint lodged by the victims mother.

 The child has been handed over to an NGO for medical examination.

 The girl indicated that she was raped. We started a case accordingly, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 The accused, identified as Shital Roy and Phanibhushan Roy, and the victim live in the same building on Muraripukur Road.

 The girl was standing in front of her room on Sunday afternoon when the men called her to theirs. They said they would show her pictures of wild animals, said an officer of Maniktala police station.

 As soon as the girl entered their room, the men bolted the door and started molesting her. Before letting her off, they gave the girl a chocolate bar and asked her not to mention what happened in the room to anyone, the officer added.

 The girl narrated the incident to her mother, who immediately lodged a complaint.

 Last month, a minor girl was raped by her neighbour in the Kidderpore area.

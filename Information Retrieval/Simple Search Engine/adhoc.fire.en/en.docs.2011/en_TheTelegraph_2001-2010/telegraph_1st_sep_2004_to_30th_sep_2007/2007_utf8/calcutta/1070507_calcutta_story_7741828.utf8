 More pollutants are dumped into the Hooghly in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area than anywhere else in West Bengal, the high court-appointed committee to monitor pollution of the river has found.

 A National River Conservation Plan team had also found the stretch of the river around Calcutta the most polluted.

 The Hooghly is polluted the most on the stretch under the jurisdiction of the CMC. There are a number of outflow channels that pour effluents into the river. There is also dumping of solid waste and encroachments on the banks, stated environmental activist Subhas Dutta, a member of the committee. His public interest litigation had resulted in the formation of the panel.

 Loading and unloading of goods vehicles in Bagbazar and Sovabazar, washing of cars and makeshift toilets on the banks are some of the other problems, added Dutta.

 There have been plenty of violations of environmental norms on the stretch. We plan to take immediate action, said environment secretary and chairman of the monitoring committee M.L. Meena.

 The CMC is trying to pass the buck to the Port Trust. The stretch along the river belongs to the Port Trust and we are not responsible for violation of environmental norms. The CMC only has a garbage vat near Nimtala Ghat, which we will remove if required, said Arun Sarkar, chief engineer (conservancy) of the CMC.

 The court committee is not buying the logic. The CMC cannot shirk its responsibility. It has allowed commercial activities near the river, which has resulted in pollution, pointed out Dutta.

 Senior law officer of the environment department and member-secretary of the committee Biswajit Mukherjee stated: We had directed the CMC and other civic bodies along the Hooghly to remove waste from the banks, ban use of plastic bags within 50 m of the river, keep the ghats clean by installing garbage vats and demolish encroachments. Apparently, not much has been done.

 The members of the panel, comprising representatives of the state and central agencies and Kalyan Rudra, an expert nominated by the court, surveyed the stretch on a speedboat on Friday.

 The committee, which will submit its findings to the court, is contemplating action against the CMC under the Environment Protection Act, after serving a notice, said sources.

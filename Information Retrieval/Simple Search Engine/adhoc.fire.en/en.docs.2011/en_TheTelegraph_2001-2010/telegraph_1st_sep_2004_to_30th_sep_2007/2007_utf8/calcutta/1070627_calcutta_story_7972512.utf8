 Sun and swim can cause eye ailments

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sunbath or swim can lead to critical eye ailments, experts have warned.

 Cases of cataract and various types of allergic conjunctivitis are on the rise in the city, thanks to rapid depletion of ozone in the atmosphere and excessive release of chemicals, like chlorine, in swimming pool water.

 There has been a 30 per cent rise in cataract cases in the city, confirmed ophthalmic surgeon Partha Bandyopadhyay. This is essentially because of the depletion of ozone, resulting in increased exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays.

 While most people know about the effects of UV radiation on the skin, few are aware of the damage it causes to the eyes. As a result, people do not take adequate measures to protect their eyes, pointed out Umang Mathur, head of cornea and refractive surgeries, Shroff Charity Eye Hospital, New Delhi.

 The skin, he explained, has a capacity to adapt to UV radiation by producing melanin, but the eyes have no such defence mechanism.

 Apart from cataracts (clouding of the lens inside), prolonged exposure to UV rays can also cause photokeratitis (sunburn of the cornea) and pterygium (a growth of tissue over the cornea, blocking the eyesight).

 Children comprise most of the risk group, as they spend a lot of time outdoors. According to doctors, 80 per cent of an individuals lifetime exposure to UV rays is complete by the age of 18.

 Wearing wide-brimmed hats or sunglasses is not enough to protect the eyes from harmful exposure. People wearing sunglasses should examine the label carefully and ensure they are 100 per cent UV-proof, said an eye specialist.

 Wearing appropriate eyewear is a must while going outdoors. Photochromic lenses adjust to the level of UV exposure. They are 100 per cent UV-proof and can be worn both indoors and outdoors, Mathur said.

 Experts have also suggested that swimmers wear special goggles to guard the eyes against waterborne bacteria and swimming pool chemicals. Among the various swimming pool hazards is the presence of excessive chlorine, which causes eye infections like allergic conjunctivitis.

 Clinic care for poor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A six-storeyed, multi-speciality hospital, with dedicated units for neurology, medicine, general surgery, dental care and paediatrics, is set to open its doors on Wednesday.

 Apex Institute of Medical Sciences, off the EM Bypass, is an initiative of a group of doctors, who have set up the speciality hospital without financial assistance from the government or private institutions.

 Two years ago, we had formed Apex Hospitex and Neuroscience Private Limited, intending to build the hospital. Around 75 members of our team have chipped in with resources to set up the hospital. We have a team of 48 experts, of whom 40 are doctors. Other members, too, have played an active role in setting up the health unit, said Susanta Bhattacharya, chairman of the board of directors.

 The hospital will be inaugurated by health and family welfare minister Surjya Kanta Mishra on Wednesday.

 Situated on an 18cottah plot at 1219 Survey Park, adjacent to Hiland Park, the hospital will initially have a multi-speciality outpatients department (OPD) and an emergency unit with 70 beds. Plans are afoot to increase the count to 140 in the next few months. 

 The initial project cost will be around Rs 8crore to Rs 10crore, a board member said. 

 The OPD will have two sessions. The first session will begin at 8am and will continue till 1pm. It will be for general patients. Underprivileged patients, who cant afford quality treatment at other high-end hospitals, will be treated at the OPD from 1pm to 3pm, Bhattacharya said.

 Our mission is to provide quality treatment at an affordable cost, the chairman signed off.

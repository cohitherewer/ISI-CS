 Cop body found hanging

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nirmal Roy, an assistant sub-inspector with the detective department of Calcutta Police, was found hanging under mysterious conditions at his Barasat residence, on the northern fringes of the city, on Friday morning.

 Police said the neighbours spotted the body around 10.30 am. Roys wife Bula and his daughter had gone to his in-laws house in Chandernagore.

 Police have not ruled out the possibility of the cop being murdered. We have got clues indicating that it might not be a case of suicide, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 Roy was wearing a shirt tucked into his trousers, a leather belt and even socks. It seems he was getting ready for office, he added. The sleuths have not found any suicide note.

 Local residents said Roy, 48, was last seen on Thursday evening at a market nearby. 

 On Friday morning, neighbours entered the house after seeing the door and windows open and found the body hanging from a rope. 

 An officer of Barasat police station said: Roys wife could not provide us with any information that might help us crack the case.

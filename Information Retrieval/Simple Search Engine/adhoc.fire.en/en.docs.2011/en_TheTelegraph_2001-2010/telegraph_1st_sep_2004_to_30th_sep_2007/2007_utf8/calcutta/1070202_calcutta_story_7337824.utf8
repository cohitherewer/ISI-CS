 A day after deciding to shift the 32nd Calcutta Book Fair to transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys home ground, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild was showered with sops by the government.

 Were giving out about 7.5 acres for the fair, the same area on which the fair was earlier held on the Maidan, said Chakraborty, adding that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had urged the sports department to provide all support to the Guild.

 So, the transport department will run special Book Fair buses, from February 10 to 21, every 10 minutes from Park Circus, Shyambazar, Maidan, Howrah, Sealdah and Ultadanga to the stadium.

 The transport link to the new venue has been a prime concern for Guild officials and participants. The shift to the Salt Lake site was, of course, forced by the high court decision not to allow Book Fair 2007 on the Maidan.

 The sports minister clarified on Thursday that soccer matches at the stadium would not be disrupted by the fair: Melar jaygaye mela hobe, khelar jaygaye khela hobe (The fair and the football will be held at separate spots).

 Chakraborty, however, ruled out the stadium as permanent venue for the Book Fair and said it should be held on the Maidan.

 Earlier in the day, Guild officials, including secretary Tridib Chatterjee and architect Sovan Banerjee, inspected the new site and held talks with representatives of the local administration.

 We will draw up the final blueprint by Friday and submit it to the district police and complete all necessary formalities. Only after weve received proper permission will we start our preparations, said Sudhangshu Dey, the ground convener. 

 The Guild will clearly play it by the book, after facing flak from the high court for starting work on the Maidan without the necessary clearances.

 The Book Fair will be held on the outer periphery of the stadium and there is no question of the main playground or even the gallery being used. No car parking would be allowed inside, asserted Bhola Nath Nandy, assistant administrative officer-in-charge of the stadium.

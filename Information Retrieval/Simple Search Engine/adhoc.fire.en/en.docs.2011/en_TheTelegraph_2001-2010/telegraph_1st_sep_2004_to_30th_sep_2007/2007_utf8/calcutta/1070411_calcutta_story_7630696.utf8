 Normalcy eluded Jadavpur University (JU) on Tuesday, with members of CPM-backed unions gathering on the campus while the students attended classes and sat for tests.

 Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, chancellor of the university, has written to vice-chancellor Shyamal Kanti Sanyal, deploring the events of April 5 and describing them as reprehensible.

 After the science faculty students union election results were declared on April 5, members of the victorious We The Independents were allegedly attacked by JU Karmachari Sansad members. Later that night, a mob ransacked the Sansad office and the universitys Science Club.

 According to officials, the governor wrote that he was glad an inquiry had been started into the incident. He mentioned that it is important to send a clear message to the campus that such acts will not be tolerated.

 The governor also asked the vice-chancellor to urge the JU Karmachari Sansad to call off their indefinite ceasework, said a university official. Gandhi, however, added that the members of the Sansad were justified in feeling victimised, the official said.

 Over 1,000 teachers, students, non-teaching staff and DYFI members attended the gathering at JU on Tuesday to protest the events on April 5.

 The Students Federation of India (SFI) leaders claimed credit for organising the meeting, but registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay said it was convened by the Sansad along with other unions. The banners carried by the protesters identified them as members of the West Bengal Ganatantrikayan Sangstha (JU unit).

 The meeting was organised to condemn the anti-social activities that took place on April 5 and before, said Anirban Ghatak, a member of SFIs Calcutta district committee.

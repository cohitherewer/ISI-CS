The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tease an impulse illness

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With three incidents of eve-teasing getting reported from various parts of Calcutta in less than 72 hours, the issue of womens safety in public places has come to the centre stage again. 

 It is evident from media reports that the number of cases of women getting harassed or molested is on the rise, said Mohormala Chatterjee, psychologist, expressing concern over the spate of molestation cases reported in the past few days. 

 But she has also found an encouraging trend in the recent incidents. It seems the women have become more confident. These days, a lot of them stand up against their tormentors and raise their voice, she added. 

 Last Monday, Gautam Singh was dragged to Gariahat police station after a Class VII student complained of being harassed by him. 

 The next day, a teacher of a reputed central Calcutta school lodged a complaint against her colleague, Prosenjit Mandal, for molesting her on the road. And on Wednesday, police arrested Sanjay Soni for harassing a college girl in an autorickshaw.

 According to Nilanjana Sanyal, a psychologist, people commit acts like molestation when they fail to control impulse. They do not think about the consequences of their act, she added. 

 Sexual disorder, desire to show supremacy over women and insecurity are some of the other reasons behind acts like molestation. 

 Whatever be the reason, it is an act of crime. If the offenders feel powerful by humiliating us, we must protest and bring their ghastly acts to others attention, said Meghna Dass, a postgraduate student of sociology. 

 Though molesters can be booked under the law, they get bail due to the loopholes in the system. In most cases, the victims do not report the incident. Besides, there are plenty of examples of police harassing the complainants. 

 The other big problem is indifference among people. So, it is upon us to protect ourselves, stressed Dass.

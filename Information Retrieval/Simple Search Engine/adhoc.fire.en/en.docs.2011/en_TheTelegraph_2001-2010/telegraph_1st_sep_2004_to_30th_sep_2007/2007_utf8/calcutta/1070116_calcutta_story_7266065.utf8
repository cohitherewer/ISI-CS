 Failure stick for colleges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University on Monday announced measures to monitor teaching standards in its affiliated colleges. The move follows a high percentage of failures in the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I exams, the first time they were held under the 1+1+1 system.

 From now, if too many students fail to the clear one or more subjects in the undergraduate examination, the authorities of the college concerned will have to provide a written explanation to the university. The colleges will also be answerable to the university for their overall performance. 

 The decision was taken on Monday at a special meeting of the universitys council for undergraduate studies.

 From this year, every college will be ranked on the basis of its students performance in the undergraduate examinations, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of university.

 The university will prepare a subject-wise database of the performance of its 170-odd colleges to determine their ranks. The principals of all poor-performing colleges will be asked for an explanation, asserted Das. 

 More than 40 per cent of the 83,288 examinees in the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part-I examinations failed to clear all five subjects. Nearly 31 per cent of students with mathematics as an elective paper, could not score the minimum qualifying marks.

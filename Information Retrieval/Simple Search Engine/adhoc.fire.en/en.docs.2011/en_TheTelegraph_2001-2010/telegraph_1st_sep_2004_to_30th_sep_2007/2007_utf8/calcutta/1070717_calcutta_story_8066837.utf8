 Loophole, apathy suit molestors

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A day after being beaten up for standing up to eve-teasers, Jagannath De spent hours with cops trying to piece together clues about the goons. On Monday evening, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee promised to find out more about the incident.

 The incident of the second-year hotel management students solitary voice of protest on a bus amidst the silence of an apathetic city adds another chapter to the book of brutality on city streets.

 CASES

 On June 14, Tina Mukherjee, an A-list model, was punched on the nose on Lake View Road when she resisted two youths in a Tata Sumo trying to molest her and snatch her bag around 9.30pm.

 Deepankar Singh and Pinku Sil were arrested later that night. Both are now out on bail.

 Six days before that, two youths, Hardeep Singh (Vicky) and Moloy Debnath, were arrested for molesting a woman in the Lake area. They were both drunk. Both are now out on bail.

 On the night of December 31, some armymen allegedly misbehaved with a woman in a hotel on Park Street. When the armymen were brought to Park Street police station, they allegedly beat up police officers and ransacked the thana.

 The same night, in 2002, sergeant Bapi Sen was beaten to death for protesting the teasing of a woman by a gang of reserve force constables. The accused are in judicial custody; the case is hampered by the absence of the woman.

 CAUSES

 Cops handling such cases claim the law is the loophole. The problem is that anything from staring at a girl to molestation everything short of rape is covered under Section 354 of the IPC. And the offence is bailable, says a senior officer.

 The other problem is the victim not turning up, either at the police station or in court. The woman in question more often than not keeps away. This is a problem we face while investigating eve-teasing or harassment or molestation. And even if arrests are made, the accused get bail, adds Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 The humiliation and the publicity that await her in police stations and in the courtroom often deter victims from pursuing the matter and punishing her tormentors.

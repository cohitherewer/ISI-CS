 Foreigner in hospital after pill overdose

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 45-year-old French national, who works for an NGO, tried to commit suicide by swallowing an overdose of sleeping pills at a five-star hospitality address in the heart of the city on Thursday afternoon.

 Darrial K. Dernandet Thierry, admitted to the intensive care unit at Calcutta Medical Research Institute, is yet to regain consciousness.

 Police have found a suicide note in his hotel room, in which he had written: I am very depressed and thats why I am taking this step. Inconvenience is regretted. I request you to cremate my body and scatter the ashes in the Ganges.

 He was rushed unconscious to CMRI. He is still unstable, though out of danger, said an officer of New Market police station. A preliminary investigation revealed that Thierry had been suffering from some ailments.

 Thierry is part of a France-based NGO Global Humaneteria which works among street children, especially in Asian countries.

 He arrived in Calcutta on June 19 and put up at the NGOs office in Lake Gardens, before checking into the hotel on June 25 evening. He has been visiting the city for the past 16 years. We are yet to know why he left the NGOs office and started staying in the hotel, the officer said.

 After lunch on Thursday afternoon, Thierry entered his room (202) and hung the do not disturb sign. The hotel staff became suspicious after seeing the room closed for more than seven hours.

 We knocked on the door for half an hour but there was no response. We tried to call Thierry through the intercom, but in vain. Seeing no option, we called New Market thana around 8pm and opened the door with the duplicate key in the presence of the police, said a hotel official.

 An empty liquor bottle was lying on the floor. Some sleeping pills were found in an empty glass, an officer said.

 Thierry, a bachelor, is a dedicated worker. He was to visit some districts in a few days, said an NGO official.

 Cricket talent crushed

 RITH BASU

 Nine-year-old Kaustav Bhattacharya: 

Under-13 all-rounder

Kaustav Bhattacharya, who died in a car crash on VIP Road on Thursday, was to play in CABs Under-13 Ambar Roy Sub-Junior Cricket Tournament for Sinthee Roypara Cricket Coaching Centre.

 His talent as an all-rounder sealed his berth in the team, though he was just nine years old, said Roypara coach Milan Biswas, Buroda to his students. He was practising at our club for the past three years.

 The club will remain closed on Saturday as a mark of respect for the Steve Waugh fan, who studied in Class III at South Point School.

 The club has also decided to name the Man of the Series award in the Under-13 tournament that it organises every year after the young talent.

 Kaustav was a middle-order batsman and a fast bowler. He played three Under-13 matches for Roypara against P. Sen Memorial Cricket Coaching Club at Digha from June 5 to 7. His scores were 25 and 10 he did not get to bat in one match. He also took six wickets.

 P. Sen club coach Swapan Dasgupta was so impressed by Kaustavs feat that he asked Biswas to let the boy practise at his club. But Kaustav could not make it to the P. Sen camp on the Maidan, as it was quite a distance from his Roypara home.

 Kaustav was running a temperature on June 4, the day the Roypara team left for Digha. He woke up late that morning because of fever and missed the team bus. But he persuaded his parents to take him to Digha. They took a bus from Esplanade later in the morning, recalled Biswas.

 Both his parents were enthusiastic about cricket. Kaustav would come to the practice accompanied by his mother. His father, too, would come occasionally, said the coach.

 Kaustavs friends at the club are devastated none more than Akash Ray, a Class III student of Adamas International School. 

 The two were the youngest members of Royparas Under-13 team. Akash was crying when he called his coach on Friday morning.

 Kaustav would watch almost every cricket match that was telecast. He used to update me regularly on scores, said Biswas, tears welling up in his eyes.

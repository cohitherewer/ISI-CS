 Kidnap trail 

with no clues

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Police are still in the dark about the disappearance of Naiyar Akhtar, who went missing after leaving his Royd Street residence on May 20.

 A team of officers from Park Street police station had gone to Gaya in search of Naiyars alleged kidnappers, but returned empty-handed early on Thursday.

 Shabbir Khan, the prime suspect who had called Naiyar on his cellphone the day he disappeared, could not be traced in Gaya.

 The other suspects Shanawaz, Zahid and Sahid too, could not be found. They are the sons of Shahjahan Khan, who was murdered in 2005.

 Naiyars father Javed and his uncles are behind bars in connection with the murder of Shahjahan, a Gaya resident.

 While looking for Shabbir we have come to know that he is related to Shahjahans family, said a senior officer of Park Street police station.

 Sleuths suspect the disappearance of Shahjahans sons is linked to Naiyars abduction, which could be the fallout of a long-standing family feud.

 The Akhtars are into various types of businesses, including construction of a runway at Gaya airport and laying of roads.

 I hope the police catch the kidnappers soon, said Janwad Ali, Naiyars brother.

 Buck pass on red light removal 

 A STAFF REPORTER

With seven days to go for the expiry of the Calcutta High Court deadline on removing unauthorised beacons from vehicle roofs, the enforcement is no more than a trickle against the deluge of offenders.

 After the court judgment banning beacons, Calcutta Police has stripped only 20 VIP vehicles of their red lights. 

 On February 23, the high court had ruled that only fire brigade, ambulance and police pilots could use beacons atop vehicles, while all other VIPs must fix the red light on the front bumper of their cars. 

 The case will come up for hearing next Friday, when the government will have to submit a status report on the compliance of the court order.

 To begin with, neither police nor the transport department the other agency responsible for implementing the court order has any estimate of the number of beacon-users in the city.

 After the court order, the state transport department has managed to confiscate only 33 beacons.

 A special squad led by an additional regional transport officer (enforcement) has intercepted 33 vehicles from various parking lots Most of these cars were being used by officials of secretary and principal secretary ranks from various departments, and also district magistrates, additional chief secretary (transport) Sumantra Chowdhury said on Thursday.

 The transport department began its crackdown on March 5, while the court order was issued on February 23. 

 We received a copy of the order on March 1 and it was only by March 2 that copies were made. The next two days were holidays, said Chowdhury, defending the delay.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb issued a circular to all departmental secretaries along with a copy of the judgment on March 2, while home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy also sent across copies to the city police commissioner and director-general of the state police for enforcement of the order. 

 Though cars flashing beacons are still a common sight in the city, the traffic department has claimed that the order has been despatched to offices of the excise and income-tax departments, BSF, CRPF and the army headquarters. 

 The results are showing The whole idea is to ensure that the order is carried out and people realise they just cant flaunt the beacons indiscriminately, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic).

 According to him, beacons have been removed from the cars of several senior officers in the state administration.

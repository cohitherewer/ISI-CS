 Dazzle of Don for D-day

 Priyanka Chopra danced the night away flaunting Vasundhara Mantris silver-and-polki earrings in Aaj ki raat in Don. Vasundharas jewels have also made it to the international ramp at the Rome Fashion Week (Couture), with Kiran Uttam Ghoshs ensembles.

 Then came Stylefile in Mumbai and the Vivah exhibition in Dubai. Vasundhara is on a dazzle roll, with the next stop being New Delhis Bridal Asia 2007, where she exhibits her designs from January 13 to 15 at The Ashok. 

 And she might also be part of Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week in March. 

 Just three years in the industry, the 25-year-old from Modern High School for Girls who trained at the Gemological institute of America, in New York, is understandably elated.

 Aki Narula picked up the earrings (for Don) from Silver Streak, a store in Bandra where I supply my creations and I couldnt believe it, smiles Vasundhara, now busy readying her Bridal Asia line. 

 She is going to display two distinct collections in the Capital one traditional and the other a funky cocktail line. The traditional range has almost real-looking pieces. I have used lots of pearls, green onyx, rubilites and turquoise stones with an antique gold finish. The pieces are also very traditional hathphool, heavy choker, maangtika and bracelet, she explains. 

 The line will see Vasundhara designing co-ordinated sets for the first time (for trousseau, people prefer picking up full sets, she feels). 

 The cocktail collection concentrates on neckpieces and some rings. The neckpieces boast of unusual stones with quartz as base, strung in ropes and leather.

 I have used quartz of various shapes and sizes, some broken, some fancy and these rock-like pieces stand out in clusters, says Vasundhara. 

 The colour palette will be subdued, with earthy hues like browns and greens making their presence felt.

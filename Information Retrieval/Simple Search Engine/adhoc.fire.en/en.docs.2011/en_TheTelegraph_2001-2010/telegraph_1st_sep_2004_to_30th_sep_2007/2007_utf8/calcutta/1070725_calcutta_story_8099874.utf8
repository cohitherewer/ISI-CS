 The seven-storeyed annexe of Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, which houses several facilities for modern healthcare, was unveiled on Tuesday.

 The day also saw the inauguration of the platinum jubilee celebrations of the hospital by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.

 The annexe, set up at a cost of Rs 10 crore on the Sarat Bose Road premises of the hospital, houses a general emergency department, an advanced paediatric unit, diagnostic facilities for outdoor patients, and a school and a college of nursing.

 A canteen, a waiting hall for patients relatives and an auditorium have also been set up in the annexe, named Adhish Chandra Sinha Memorial Building.

 Speaking at the programme, Swami Sarvalokananda, the secretary of Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, announced plans to install MRI facilities and a cathlab with provisions for angiography. We have plans to start cardiac surgeries in the near future. An undergraduate medical college will be set up, but not immediately, he said.

 In our country, 80 per cent of the infant mortality cases occur in the first 28 days, of which 80 per cent happen in the first week, said state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra. So, its important to have neo-natal intensive care units in all hospitals. We are trying to set up the units in all government hospitals across the state.

 The neo-natal intensive care unit at RK Mission Seva Pratishthan is equipped with ventilators, warmers and other facilities. The 50-bed paediatric department, in addition to the existing 70-bed unit, is spread across the second and third floors of the annexe.

 The operating theatre in the department is equipped with the state-of-the-art gadgets required for all critical surgeries. There are specialised sections for orthopaedics, ENT and medicine.

 The Sinhas from Kandi, Murshidabad, donated Rs 5.1 crore for the construction of building, named after a member of the family, Adhish Chandra Sinha, who died at the age of 59 following several ailments.

 Abha Sinha, Adhish Chandras mother, Mary, his widow, and other members of the family were present at Tuesdays programme. The dream which my brother had nurtured for long is fulfilled today, said Bikash Sinha, the director of Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics and Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, who is also a cousin of Adhish Chandra. He died before his dream came true but his mother and wife fought stubbornly to see it fulfilled.

 The platinum jubilee souvenir of the hospital was released by Swami Gitananda, the vice-president of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission.

 Swami Atmasthananda, the vice-president of the Math and Mission, Swami Prabhananda, the general secretary of the Math and Mission, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and R.K. Srivastava, the director-general of health services of India, were also present.

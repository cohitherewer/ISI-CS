 Attack on Mumbai police

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A police team from Mumbai came under attack when it reached a Howrah village on Monday to arrest two persons in connection with a theft at a gold jewellery shop. Five persons, including three policemen, were injured.

 The accused Sheikh Jumman and wife Zahirunnisa fled the village, Tajpur, in Amta, taking advantage of the chaos. Ten persons were arrested for the violence.

 The police said the couples sons, Nasir and Basir, worked in a jewellery shop at Lokmanya Tilak Marg, Mumbai, for two years. They went missing on a January day when jewellery, weighing 400 g, was stolen from the shop.

 Basir was arrested in Mumbai last month. He admitted to the police that he and his brother had stolen the ornaments and handed them over to brother-in-law Firoze. The cops tracked down Firoze, who claimed that the jewellery was with Jumman and Zahirunnisa.

 An officer of the district police said: Well help the Mumbai team arrest the duo.

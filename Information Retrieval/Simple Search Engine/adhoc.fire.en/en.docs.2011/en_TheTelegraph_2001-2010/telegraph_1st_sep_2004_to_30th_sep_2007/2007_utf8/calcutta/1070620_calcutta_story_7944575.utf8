 Killing fields: Boys at play, perhaps soon to go at each others throats. Picture by Biswarup Datta 

 I went to Tollygunge Service Station (1 NSC Bose Road) for the emission test of my motorcycle on May 15. I usually go to the service station for the test as it is close to my house. 

 I asked the man who was taking the test for his reaction to True lies of tailpipe tests that had appeared in Metro on the same day. He said: Dont worry. Only the date of the certificate will be checked. 

 That night I went through my certificate and found that the model of my vehicle had been wrongly mentioned as Street 100 instead of Splendor Plus. This prompted me to check the certificates that had been issued earlier after emission tests. In the first certificate, dated June 29, 2006, the model of the vehicle had been mentioned correctly. In the second certificate on December 16, 2006, the vehicles model had become Splendor. 

 I went back to the service station the next day. After taking a look at my certificates, the man who took the test asked me to ignore the matter. He even threatened me when I challenged him. 

 Avijit Das,

 Sodepur Road. 

 The introduction of moral and value education in schools was necessary (School lessons on anger management, May 16). It should be made mandatory for schools to offer the course. It is unfortunate that a number of children have recently died in fights at playgrounds and schools. Inclusion of yoga in school curriculum might also be helpful. Youngsters are being exposed to violence like never before. They need help to deal with anger. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala . 

 The death of a 10-year-old boy from a blow on the face by his classmate was shocking (10-year-old felled by friend blow; doctor under cloud, May 15). The classmate could not have known that the blow would be fatal, but he should have been taught that use of force to establish ones right is wrong in civil society. Unfortunately, children now learn to accept violence as a part of life. Also, if someone intervened at the start of the fight, it would not have ended in a tragedy. School and college authorities should be more vigilant. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala.

 It is sad that children these days fight seriously enough to kill their classmates. Guardians and teachers should try to make them aware of the significance of their actions. There should be counselling facilities in all schools. The doctors negligence in treating the injured child is just as alarming. The government should bring such doctors to book. 

 Rathin Chatterjee,

 Dum Dum. 

 Apropos the report Rookie crushes school boy, May 17, it is sad that a boy was crushed under the wheels of a car in front of his twin brother. Twins are deeply attached to each other and one does not know how the boy who survived will be affected. The youth who was driving the car without even a learners licence should be punished severely. It is an irony that the mishap happened within 48 hours of the Centre tabling a bill in Parliament proposing to double the penalty for traffic-rule violation and compensation to victims. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos the report CM sermon to cops, May 22, the chief ministers exhortations to the police commissioner regarding corruption in the force is unlikely to cut much ice. If a mere lecture could root out corruption, then it would have ceased to be a problem long ago. To repair the tarnished image of cops, the corrupt officers should be punished without consideration for political gains. Punishment is also the only way to ensure that the police deal with those who approach them for help fairly. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur. 

 Kudos to the state tourism department for its initiative to boost the tourism sector in West Bengal (Image boost for Bengal tourism, May 16). It is distressing that the state despite having tremendous tourism potential not only fails to attract many foreigners but also finds it difficult to draw domestic tourists. The government should improve the tourism infrastructure and go all out to woo travellers. This will also boost the economy of the state. 

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur. 

 Apropos the report Maid link in flat robbery, May 14, how could an armed gang of three rob an elderly woman in her Cornfield Road flat and beat her up without help from the maid? The fact that the maid is missing since the robbery confirms the suspicion. Such incidents have gone up in the city. And there is perhaps no way to get rid of the menace as elderly people living alone cannot do without help. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 Apropos the report Books a click away, May 15, it is good to know that the National Library authorities are going to offer free Internet access to readers. Its wonderful that readers will be able to go through old and new books preserved in a digitised form. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake.

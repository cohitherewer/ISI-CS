The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Transfer roster in cop fuel scam

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The fuel scam at the Calcutta Police wireless office on Ripon Street has started taking toll.

 Days after Metro blew the lid off the scam on April 7 (see grab below), around 100 drivers and the officer-in-charge (OC) of the Ripon Street unit have been transferred.

 Sources said the OC, S.K. Chowdhury, and the drivers will now have to report to the radio flying squad or the high radio flying squad.

 Metro had reported how a section of employees in the Ripon Street office were selling fuel issued for police vehicles.

 Four head drivers, involved in supplying fuel to vehicles, have been pulled up for discrepancies in the log book. They sold the fuel to outsiders, an officer said. 

 The petrol pump at the wireless office caters to 65 per cent of police vehicles daily. Each police vehicle gets a daily allotment of 10 litres of diesel or petrol. 

 The drivers at the Ripon Street office issued fuel for vehicles which were not in use and sold the fuel to outsiders. 

 A senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters said complaints of siphoning off of fuel were pouring in from several quarters and the transfer was aimed at stemming the rot.

 A detailed inquiry has been launched. Those found involved in the scam will be dealt with sternly. The transfer orders are just warnings, he added. 

 Deputy commissioner (wireless) Anand Kumar, however, said the transfers were routine. The drivers had been posted in the office for the past two years. As for the fuel scam, he said: We have also launched a probe.

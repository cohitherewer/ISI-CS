 With the Xponse expose raising questions on how a tech firm could conduct illegal business from an industrial township, the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority the tech hubs apex body has suddenly woken up to the need for a database of companies.

 In a knee-jerk reaction to the unprecedented raid on Xponse and the arrest of Sanjay Kedia, CEO and MD of the company, the authorities have decided to conduct a survey to collect company-specific data, like location, floor-area, total work force, nature of operations and amount paid as monthly rent. 

 We are looking at the key issues of Sector V, including the security aspects, and the survey will be of great help, said S.A. Ahmed, chairman of the authority. 

 On Wednesday, Ahmed held a meeting with some officers to draw up the broad contours of the survey and beef up security measures in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec). Over 300 IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) companies, which employ around 30,000 people, have their offices in Sector V. 

 But there will be certain limitations, because this survey will not be able to give us a peek into the exact details of a companys dealings with its clients, admitted a senior officer of the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority.

 Debesh Das, state IT minister, also admitted that keeping track of the dealings of the companies was an impossible proposition. 

 It is next to impossible for us or any other department to monitor the activities of individual companies, said Das. 

 According to Kiran Karnik, president, Nasscom the industry body adherence to the spirit of the law can be the best deterrent to such frauds. 

 Intervention of the authorities cannot do much A market-driven certification of companies can be of some help, said Karnik.

 Online nod for township plans

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has started sanctioning residential building plans in New Town, Rajarhat, over the Internet. 

 This enables plot-owners from any part of the world to get their plans passed quickly without physically visiting the township.

 Over 52 plans have been sanctioned online between August and the first week of September.

 In the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area, it takes at least three months to get a building plan sanctioned. In the online system, sanction can be obtained in a day.

 Hidco claims to be the second authority in the country, after Pune municipality, to introduce online sanction of building construction proposals. The details of the procedure are available at www.newtownsanction.org.

 The website, developed by the Regional Computer Centre, was launched on December 2006. The online sanction service was started in August after training of Hidco staff by the centre.

 We are currently sanctioning online plans for private and cooperative residential buildings not taller than G+4 and not covering more than 1,500 sq m (approximately 22 cottah), said Uma Ghosh, the senior general manager (building plan) of Hidco.

 Architect Dulal Mukherjee said: It is good news for the plot-owners as well as architects and civic engineers. In this age of speed, wastage of time for routine check cannot be accepted. We hope the CMC will take a similar step.

 A plot-owner or an architect assigned by him can fill up the form online. For signing in, a plot-owner has to furnish some basic information. After signing in, he or she will be able to access the main form. The sanction papers will be handed over after payment of the fees. The Hidco estate management department is maintaining a database of plans.

 Trust him to steal the limelight every time a Bachchan or a Roshan makes some noise. Now with the sounds of shaadi filling Jalsa, Shah Rukhs new mannat is a music video to promote Kaun Banega Crorepati. If there was any doubt, well, the STAR people confirmed that it was SRK who came up with the idea of the video. It went on to be conceptualised, choreographed, and sung by Ganesh Hegde. Vishal-Shekhar has done the music and the lyrics are by Shabbir, R.D. Telang, Kumar and Asif Baig. 

The title and also the opening line of the video goes Kar le, kar le tu ek sawaal. The three-minute video will premiere on STAR Plus on January 22 at 9 pm just before the new KBC takes off. Till then you can catch 15-second teasers with Shah Rukh in a bizarre cross between Don and Riddler!

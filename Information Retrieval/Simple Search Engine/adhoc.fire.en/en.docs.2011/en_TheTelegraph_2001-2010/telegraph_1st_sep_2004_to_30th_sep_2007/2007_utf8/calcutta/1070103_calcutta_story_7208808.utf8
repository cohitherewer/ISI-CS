 Wake up to a new brew

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Calcutta will soon boast of a Costa Coffee outlet 

 For the rising count of coffee buffs in the city, theres more steaming news brewing, and for the retail revolution, another significant signpost.

 Costa Coffee, UKs largest and best-known coffee brand, is set for a Calcutta foray with its finest flavours of roasted coffee including the special blend of Mocha Italia and its signature Frescato range of semi-frozen drinks by the third quarter of this year.

 We plan to have six stores operating by the end of the year. Calcutta is a high-potential market for Costa and we are confident the citys refined taste buds will appreciate our product basket, says Rocky Kalra, chief operating officer.

 Devyani International, exclusive master franchisee of Yum! International for Pizza Hut, KFC and Costa Coffee in the east, has signed up for the first Costa Coffee outlet at The Terminus Mall in Rajarhat being developed by Bengal Greenfields. 

 The mall will also house Pizza Hut and KFC.

 City Centre II in Rajarhat and Mani Square on the EM Bypass are the other properties likely to house Costa Coffee.

 Owned by Whitbread Inc, the 1.8-billion UK-based leisure company, Costa today has close to 500 stores in the UK and over 650 outlets worldwide, with an annual turnover of 150 million. It plans to open 2,000 outlets globally by 2010.

 The chain was started in 1971 by the Costa brothers, Sergio and Bruno, who drew on their Italian lineage to establish Costas unique roasting style. 

 Since the launch of its first outlet in September 2005 in Delhi, Costa Coffee has opened 18 more stores and is expected to have around 45 Indian outlets in place by end-2007. 

 With outlets being plotted in Bangalore and Mumbai, the long-term plan is to open 300 coffee shops in the next three-four years.

 Costa Coffee is a very exciting brand and we are happy to facilitate their arrival in Calcutta, which can look forward to a clutch of other international F amp;B brands, says Abhijit Das, associate director of property consultants Trammell Crow Meghraj.

 The design concept, following an international template, aims to bring the brand value and personality to life with the warm, deep red leitmotif. 

 We believe in a hospitable, genuine, full-of-life Italian coffee experience, wherever the outlet is located, stressed Kalra.

 The coffee retail market in India is expected to grow at an annual rate of over 30 per cent in the next couple of years riding a GeNext wave, and most of this growth is being witnessed in major metros and large towns.

 Besides the popular Mocha Italia and the Frescato drinks in different flavours like Coffee, Vanilla, Mango, Lemon, Summer Fruit and Caramel, Costa Coffee will serve innovative, premium and indulgent food originating from the Mediterranean.

 The globally consistent range of espresso-based coffee and drinks will be the Costa mainstay. 

 The range, packaging and merchandising evokes the feel of an up market deli, providing the consumer cues of handmade, fresh Italian food, promises an official of Devyani.

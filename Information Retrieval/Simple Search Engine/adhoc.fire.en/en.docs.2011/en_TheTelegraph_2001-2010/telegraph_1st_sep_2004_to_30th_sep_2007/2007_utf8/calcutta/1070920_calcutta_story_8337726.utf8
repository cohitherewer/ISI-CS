 Joke turns fatal fight

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chanda Singh, 18, deflated the cycle tyre of Sanjib Jha as a joke. Little did she know this would lead to an altercation between her family and a neighbour, leaving one dead.

 On Tuesday, Jha came to give private tuition to the children of Joyprakash Jha, 45, the next-door neighbour of Chanda, in Mahestala. 

 Chanda lives with her mother Kaushalya, brother Jackie and uncle Bejoy. 

 After tuition, Jha came out and saw Chanda running away with the valve of his cycle tyre. 

 Jha requested her to return the valve but she refused. So, he entered her room and took the valve forcefully from her.

 On noticing this, Jackie and Bejoy dragged him out of the room and started beating him up. Hearing the ruckus outside, Joyprakash came out to save Jha. Jackie and Bejoy then started beating Joyprakash till he fainted. He was rushed to Vidyasagar Hospital, where he was declared dead. 

 According to neighbour Deepak Naskar, there was an old feud between the families. Bejoy has been arrested and Chanda and Kaushalya have been detained. Jackie is on the run, said D.P. Singh, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas. 

 Murdered

 Bikram Chanda, 27, was murdered on Tuesday night at Thakurpurkur. Bejoy Das has been arrested. Police said Bikram, Bejoy and another man got drunk on Tuesday and started a fight, in which the duo smashed Bikrams head with a brick. A hunt is on for Bejoys accomplice.

Calcutta High Court on Thursday denied bail to Renuka Sharma, mother of the three owners of a nursing home that allegedly sold newborns to childless couples.

 The order passed by the division bench, comprising Justice Amit Kumar Talukdar and Justice Prosenjit Mondal, said: Renuka Sharma cannot be granted bail as her three sons are still at large.

 The judges observed: Granting bail to Renuka will send out a wrong message. People will think that the judiciary is not taking requisite steps to curb crime.

 The 72-year-olds sons ran Everest Nursing Home at South Sinthee, in Dum Dum. Ashimesh Goswami, the public prosecutor, said: The babies of unmarried women were delivered at an advanced stage of pregnancy on the pretext of abortion. They were kept in incubators, away from the mothers, and later sold to childless couples against hefty payments.

 Police were informed about the racket on August 17 when a local resident, Rana Ghosh, lodged a complaint against the nursing home with Dum Dum police station.

 The police raided the nursing home on August 19, and seized a three-day-old girl. The nursing home authorities had planned to sell the baby for Rs 85,000 to a couple who admitted the fact before the police, said Goswami.

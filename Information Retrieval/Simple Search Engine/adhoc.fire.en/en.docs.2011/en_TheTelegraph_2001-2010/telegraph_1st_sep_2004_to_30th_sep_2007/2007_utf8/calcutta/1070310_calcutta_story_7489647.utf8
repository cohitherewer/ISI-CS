 Help, let a girl live

 - STEM CELL THERAPY ONLY OPTION

 Sumona Das the year she fell ill

 Sumona Das, now 32, was undergoing teachers training at Loreto House when all of a sudden, she fell ill in May 1999, with what appeared to be a cold and a respiratory problem.

 While being transported through hospital in a wheelchair, she fell off, only worsening her condition.

 An error in the application of the oxygen ventilator left her in a coma, from which she has never been able to recover. Since 1999, things have improved, but only marginally. Now, Sumona can only utter monosyllables and follow simple commands.

 After six years in an incapacitated state, things are beginning to look up for Sumona. Her teacher trainer from Loreto House, Ayesha Das, has led a campaign to raise funds for her to undergo stem cell treatment in Delhi, at the hands of doctor Geeta Shroff. 

 Das wrote a great deal of letters appealing to ex-Loreto students, their friends and families for help in raising money for the therapy.

 Sumona has undergone the first phase of the treatment, but stem cell therapy is a very expensive and long process, said Das.

 With the initial cost of the treatment being estimated at Rs 7 lakh, Sumonas family and Das have so far managed to raise only Rs 3 lakh.

 The full course of the treatment is to run between 18 months and two years. Subsequent visits to the hospital will probably be three to four weeks at a time, confirmed Das.

 Nursing home expenses stand at Rs 5,000 a day and the charge of a physiotherapist and a neurologist is in the region of Rs 2,400 a week. We reckon that the cost of the full treatment will be around Rs 10-12 lakh, said Das.

 The teacher feels its quite difficult to get significant donations for such a cause. Many see people in the streets, and admirably give their money to help put a roof over their head. But Sumona has no life at all at the moment. If people give money for this treatment, they are helping to give a girl another shot at life.

 For contributions to Sumonas treatment, please contact Ayesha Das at 9830408509.

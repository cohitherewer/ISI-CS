 A tapestry of vibrant hues

 Asincere artist is not one who makes a faithful attempt to put on to canvas what is in front of him, but one who tries to create something which is, in itself, a living thing William Dobell. A group of contemporary artists, both senior and upcoming, is currently exhibiting a selection of their figurative works titled, Tradition in Modern. Art always had a high place in the Indian way of life and the Indian view of life. Akin to the highest experience of human life, it led to an intuition of reality and subtle identity. It is, however, not exclusively an Indian view, it is a universally shared view held by the Neo-platonists, Goethe, Blake, Schopenhauer and Schiller, and supported by Croce and others in modern times. Bengal art has been holding on to this tradition for nearly two centuries. Gradually artists felt an urge to expand their vision further. This show is a gorgeous tapestry, richly woven in diverse strands of vibrant hues, comprising images of three decades of contemporary realities divergent in each artists personal experience yet converging in certain aspects of the stylistic and formal values. Participants include Manoj Dutta, Prokash Karmakar (a painting by him appears right), Partho Pratim Deb, Avijit Dutta, Abhijit Mitra, Subroto Pal and Chhattrapati Dutta.

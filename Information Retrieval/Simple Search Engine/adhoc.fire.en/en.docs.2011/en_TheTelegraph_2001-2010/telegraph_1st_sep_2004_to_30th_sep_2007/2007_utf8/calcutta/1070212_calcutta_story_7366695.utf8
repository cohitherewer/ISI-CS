 Inspiring biz bosses

 - Positive response to initiative 

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 In the early part of the last century, some of the countrys biggest business families started their journeys in Calcutta. The city lost its sheen in the 60s and the 70s, with the exodus of both capital and capitalists. 

 With big businesses renewing their interest in the state, the wheel has again turned in favour of Bengal and the impact can be felt across campuses. 

 Officials of the National Entrepreneurship Network (NEN) a non-profit initiative to inculcate entrepreneurial mindset among students were pleasantly surprised when 28 premier academic institutions signed up with them in less than four months. 

 We wanted to bypass Calcutta because of its history, but now we are looking to expand to other parts of the east, said Abhijan Ganguly, consultant, NEN Calcutta. We had aimed to bring on board at least 14 institutions by March 2007. The response has surpassed our expectations. 

 NEN is part of Wadhwani Foundation promoted by Romesh Wadhwani, a Silicon Valley-based entrepreneur and chairman of the Symphony Group set up to inspire, educate and support Indian entrepreneurs. The network has over 150 member-institutes across the country, including premier B-schools and tech schools. 

 Presidency College was the first academic institution in the state to sign up with NEN, followed by Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Institute of Engineering amp; Management, St Xaviers College, Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management and NSHM Academy. 

 E-cell or entrepreneurship cells will be opened at these centres. In the first year, NEN will provide support by organising workshops and lecture sessions. From the second year, NEN will help colleges start entrepreneurship courses. 

 The faculty of the member-colleges will undergo entrepreneurship educators course, developed in partnership with Stanford University.

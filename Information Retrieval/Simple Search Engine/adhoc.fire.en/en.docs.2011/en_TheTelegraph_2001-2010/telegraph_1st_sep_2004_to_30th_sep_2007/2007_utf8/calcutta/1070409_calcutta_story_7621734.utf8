 Traffic cops operating signals with remote control or even SMS could soon be a reality on Calcutta roads. 

 As part of a modernisation drive, the Calcutta Police traffic department is installing advanced signalling systems that allow remote and automatic operation. 

 We recently held a meeting with the city-based manufacturer of the signalling systems. We asked for a demonstration. I also asked them to expedite the upkeep of the signals, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim. 

 The new system will allow better utilisation of manpower, said officers of the department. 

 Constables will be able to operate the signals while handling traffic on road. Currently, a constable has to be posted at each crossing only for operating the signals, explained owner of the company Bimal Duari.

 The new signals can be operated even through the Internet. The system will also allow single-channel operation, which is not possible in the existing system. For example, if one channel of a road is closed, its other channel cannot be opened. Moreover, sensors can be fitted to the signals, which can then be programmed to operate automatically. Thus, the signal will automatically change to green when the road on which it is installed becomes congested, added Duari.

 Such comparative signalling is needed at multiple-point crossings during rush hours, said traffic officers. Use of cameras can enable police to control the signals from a centralised location, without officers being deployed at the spot. However, this comes at a price. The new machines will be thrice as expensive as the old ones. 

 According to traffic officers, the system will allow them to design green corridors. It is a challenge for traffic police to keep signals open at each crossing for smooth movement of VIPs. We explained to the cops that this could be easily achieved with our signals. The sensor will open one route and close the others when a VIP comes within 200 m of the signal. This way, signals will open one after the other without any monitoring by the traffic department, claimed Duari. 

 The department is going hi-tech in other ways, too. Deputy commissioner Shamim said within a month, officers would get simple computer-based handheld devices. These will help them to quickly dispose of cases and track regular road-rule violators. We have completed the formalities and expect the devices to be delivered to us soon, said Shamim.

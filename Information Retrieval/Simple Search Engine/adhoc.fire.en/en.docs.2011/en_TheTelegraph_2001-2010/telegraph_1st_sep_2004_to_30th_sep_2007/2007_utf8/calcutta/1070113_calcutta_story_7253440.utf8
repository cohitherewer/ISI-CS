 Faith and fidelity

 Of all cultural features, perhaps those relating to love and sexuality differ most widely from land to land, age to age. Examining the question of cultural mobility, Greenblatt of Harvard University and Mee, a Broadway playwright, have taken a lost play of Shakespeare to work out the implications of the original problem it presents, according to the local tradition of different societies. The second of such attempts, a Bengali version by Sukanta Chaudhuri, is the subject of Jaha Chai..., Nandikars latest production. Its plot runs around the relationships between three pairs of young people, including a newly-married couple. Playing out their relationships in a spirit of irony and jest, the characters, however, surprise with their sudden sallies into romance, sentiment and introspection. At the most obvious level, the play is a rollicking comedy; at another, a serious exploration of minds and relationships; at yet another, a quizzical treatment of philosophic themes like truth and representation. Direction: Rudraprasad Sengupta and Goutam Halder.

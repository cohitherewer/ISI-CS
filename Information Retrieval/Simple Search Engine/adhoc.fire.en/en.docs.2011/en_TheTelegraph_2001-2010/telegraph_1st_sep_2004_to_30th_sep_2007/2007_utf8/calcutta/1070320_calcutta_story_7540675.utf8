The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Only Connect 

Strike the right chord

ONLY CONNECT 

 Abhijit Gupta 

 I am writing this column in the middle of the afternoon, in a deserted four-storey building. On most days, this place hums with the comings and goings of thousands of teachers and students, from morning to late evening. Not today. The only thing I can hear is the buzzing drone of the computer in front of me.

 It is March 16, 2007 today, and a statewide bandh has been called to protest against the massacre of villagers in Nandigram two days ago. In the department where I teach, all but two of my students have elected to stay at home. None of my colleagues can be seen on the premises. The office staff is however present. I am here because of two reasons: I stay close to the campus; and I do not believe that a bandh is a valid means of protest.

 Having said which, I should also add that for the first time in over two decades, I did not feel like coming out on a bandh day. I did not want to teach, I did not want to work, and I did not want to write this column. This was not a conscious, well-thought decision. It was as if a part of my brain had shut down and gone on strike, numbed by the endless onslaught of images on the television set, on newspapers and on computer screens. 

 This column, as many of you know, is about connectedness and about the wonderful new technologies which enable it to happen. It celebrates the playful and the trivial, and pays tribute to those who tap-dance on the tightrope between reality and illusion. It is not about agriculture and industry, and it is certainly not about politics.

 But on days like this, when there are no voices to be heard in the corridors, no strumming of guitar strings in a distant classroom, no constant slamming of lift doors, no voices raised in slogans or united in song, the minds ear begins to supply its own sound effects: the screams of fleeing people, the thuds of lathis striking human bodies, the muffled blasts of bombs, the scream of bullets. I can hear the groans, and the dying voices, and the cries for help.

 This column appears in a page for young people, for many of whom this will be the first exposure to an event of such magnitude and horror, not occurring in some distant killing field but practically next door. Only Connect does not presume to tell them what to think, or how to make sense of the events. It can only urge them not to forget.

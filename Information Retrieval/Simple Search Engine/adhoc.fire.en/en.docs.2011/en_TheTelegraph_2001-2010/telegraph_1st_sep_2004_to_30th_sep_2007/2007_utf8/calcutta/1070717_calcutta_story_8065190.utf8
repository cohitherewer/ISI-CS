 An appeal for justice

 A play that stands on our ability to give credence to the testimony of an anti-social, Dastak (a scene from the play appears right) brings us face to face with one of the most dangerous evils of modern urban society. The play begins on a note of suspense, with a thief trying to enter the house of a judge. But, he is no ordinary thief. He has come on an important mission: to speak to the judge about a secret, which only he is aware of. The judge is naturally surprised and sceptical of the intentions of his nocturnal visitor. And, as he listens, he is all the more shocked to hear a tale of brutal crime and murder that he can hardly believe. A group of builders, interested in setting up a shopping mall at a particular site, had set fire to a row of shanties that stood there. A boy, who was witness to their crime, was also killed by them. The thief has come to inform the judge of this truth, the day before he would deliver judgment on the case. But, will respectable guardians of society pay heed to the statement of a mere thief? What are the chances of justice being delivered or denied? These uncomfortable questions confront the audience as the play draws to a close. Direction: Aloke Chakravorty.

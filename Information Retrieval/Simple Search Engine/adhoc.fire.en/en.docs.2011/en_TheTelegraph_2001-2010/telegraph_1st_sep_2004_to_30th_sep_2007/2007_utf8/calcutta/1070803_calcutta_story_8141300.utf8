 Loan agent makes off with Rs 1.9 lakh

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Javed Ahmed opted for a bank loan to fulfil his dream of a home. But his agent took advantage of his ignorance and siphoned off Rs 1.9 lakh from his bank account. 

 Another innovation in financial fraud came into light on Thursday, with the arrest of four persons, including three employees of an agency working for a private bank. 

 They tampered with a post-dated cheques he had given the agent as equated monthly instalment (EMI), said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (south). 

 Ahmed, a resident of Park Street, had taken a home loan of Rs 4.5 lakh from a private bank. He did not approach the bank directly but took the help of agents to get the loan sanctioned, added Shamim. 

 As Ahmed, a businessman, had all the relevant papers, his loan was sanctioned. To repay the amount, Ahmed handed over eight cheques to the agent, identified as Anirban Roy, to repay the loan in 15 years. Roy convinced him to give them an extra cheque and he obliged, said an officer of Park Street police station. 

 Everything was fine the first eight months and Rs 5,700 as EMI kept getting deducted from Ahmeds account. But in the ninth month, he saw Rs 1.9 lakh was missing from his account. Ahmed contacted the bank and learnt that the money was transferred to the account of some Arun Shaw. He lodged a complaint with Park Street police station.

 During the course of investigation, police first tracked down Shaw. Shaw, an associate of Roy, confessed that he withdrew the amount from Ahmeds account by tampering with the cheque and forging his signature, said an officer.

 Shaw also disclosed the names of his associates Dhiraj Singh, Sheikh Nasim and Sheikh Shamim who were arrested on Thursday. But Roy, believed to be the mastermind, has managed to flee. All of them were employees of the agency the bank had hired to sell its products, said the Park Street police station official.

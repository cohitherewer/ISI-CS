 Club bends gender bar

 The Calcutta Club. A Telegraph picture

 Sorry, men only. Calcutta Club has broken free of this 100-year-old membership clause in its centenary year. It will now welcome women as independent members.

 We thought that in a democratic country, everyone must have equal rights. The gender bias should not be there. Its a fundamental policy that was lacking and has now been amended, said club president Dipak Mukherjee. The selection criteria for membership for women will be the same as for men. There will be strict scrutiny and a screening committee will scan the applicants, he added.

 Formed in 1907, Calcutta Club cloned the tradition of London clubs where women members were not allowed. Women whose husbands were members enjoyed the facilities and services of the club as dependant members. Special membership was granted to widows choosing to avail of the facility. Even NRI and corporate membership was restricted to men.

 Calcutta Club is the only social club in the city that does not allow women members. That changed on Friday evening, when an open forum with 13 speakers, including past-presidents and senior members, and many more as part of audience, revisited the tradition and voted for change. 

 The best thing about the evening was that instead of a point of debate, this became a point of unison, said senior committee member Kalyan Chowdhury.

 Previous to the evening, each member was sent a letter that listed two primary agendas the first one was about making election procedures transparent, and the second was about lady membership.

 Shedding the past and moving on is a positive change. Sons of members are usually given preference; I hope that now applies to daughters, said 46-year-old Runu Agarwal, a dependant member for nine years at the club.

 Ironically, Calcutta Club has an existing Ladies Advisory Committee, which actively participates in annual events like the International Evening, carnivals and flower-shows and holds regular coffee meets and cookery sessions. Now with the inclusion of ladies as members, we hope to do much more for the club, said Jhamru Mukherjee, first lady, Ladies Advisory Committee.

 Next target for woman power at Calcutta Club? The centenary year committee elections this July.

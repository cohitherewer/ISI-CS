The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Khandadhar

 Much of western Orissa is rocky and barren due to inadequate rainfall. However, towards the north, along the states border with Chhattisgarh, there are lush green forests and blue hills. Further east is Rourkela, home to a steel plant. Ninety-two km from the steel town is Khandadhar, the highest waterfall in Orissa.

 The journey from Rourkela to Khandadhar via Lohanipara and Kuthgean is memorable. The first part of the trip is along National Highway 23, which cuts through a dense forest and hills. There are small villages within the forest, where tribals, mostly Mundas and Santhals, live.

 From Lohanipara, the road splits into three. One arm heads towards Sambalpur, the second towards Barsua and the third towards Khandadhar. The condition of the district highway from Lohanipara to Khandadhar via Kuthgean is very bad. There is bus service on that route, but Trekkers are more easily available.

 Khandadhar falls can be seen from far away. The water cascades down from a height of about 245 metre. All around are dense growths of kendu, kusum, sal, segun, mohua, palash and akashmoni. The view will take your breath away. The surroundings are tranquil. You will only hear the rustle of the leaves against the breeze.

 Wild animals like bears, wild boars, elephants, jackals and wolves move freely in the region around the falls. A bridge connects two of the hills. At the foot of one of them are three tiny shops selling tea and light snacks. A trek of a couple of kilometres from there will take you to the upper reaches of the waterfall.

 There is a cluster of tribal villages a few kilometres from Khandadhar. The inhabitants of the hamlets survive by collecting kendu leaves (used for making bidi) or wood. The tribals are in festive mood on moonlit nights. The hills reverberate with the beats of madal on full moon nights.

 Spring is especially wonderful here when the trees are in full bloom. 

 Going 

 Rourkela can be reached by Mumbai Mail (via Nagpur), Gitanjali Express, Ispat (Sambalpur) Express. The distance from Calcutta is 416 km. From Rourkela, break your journey to Khandadhar at Lohanipara and Kuthgeon. For a comfortable trip, hire a car. The approximate fare from Rourkela to Khandadhar is Rs 2,000

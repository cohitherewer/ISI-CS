 Travel back in time to savour Wazwan fare from the sigris of undivided Kashmir, tuck into an Oriental crab cake or sip a laid-back cappuccino. On your way out, check out the latest that BMW has to offer in its first showroom in eastern India. Mainland China and Tangerine, Caf Coffee Day and Amber all under one roof, right here on the burgeoning Bypass.

 Silver Arcade, Calcuttas first retail format focused primarily on fine F amp;B, next to Spring Club and the Silver Spring condo complex, is ready to open its doors to a clutch of top-notch taste-bud ticklers.

 The concept of the mini mall evolved from the growing exclusivity of the location, with two more five-star hotels about to come up. Our objective is to offer an eclectic spread that can compete with the star addresses, says Piyush Bhagat, director, Springfield Projects, developers of the mall.

 Anjan Chatterjee of Speciality Restaurants, who is bringing the Mainland China brand and also Calcuttas first Sigree lost cuisine from undivided India to the mall, agrees that Silver Arcade would provide competition to the five-stars. Our effort is to bring to the city forgotten dishes, like Pakistani Nihari Gosht. The strong recall of our brands will draw guests even from the five-stars, Chatterjee tells Metro.

 While Sigree will be a 140-cover restaurant, Mainland China II will seat 150. Both the eateries, taking up nearly 20,000 sq ft, are set to entertain diners by the year-end.

 Another popular restaurant brand, Tangerine, was the first big name to move in, flagging off its banquets last week. Our banquets will offer multi-cuisine fare, catering to corporate bashes, theme parties and product launches, declares Jyoti Pandey, director, Tangerine.

 Silver Arcade is Calcuttas first informal mall for evening relaxation, explains architect J.P. Agrawal, who has designed the 75,000-sq-ft retail rendezvous. Amber, which has taken up 2,500 sq ft, is doing a lounge- bar and a 90-seater restaurant, also set to open by the year-end.

 High-end cars have great synergy with fine food. Besides the exclusive BMW showroom, Glix will set up a car-detailing spa in the mall, says Bhagat.

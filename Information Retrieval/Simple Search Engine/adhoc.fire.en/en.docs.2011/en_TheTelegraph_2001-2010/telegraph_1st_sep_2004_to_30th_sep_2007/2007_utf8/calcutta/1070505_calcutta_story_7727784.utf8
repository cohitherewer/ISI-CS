The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has allotted Rs 5 crore to the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) to beautify parks and waterbodies in the city and on its fringes. 

 The parks under immediate consideration include Park Circus Maidan and Rabindra Kanan, in north Calcutta. The Padmapukur swimming pool-cum-park, near Kidderpore, and three waterbodies in Sarsuna, on the southern fringes of the city, will also benefit from the beautification drive. 

 We plan to make each of these spots a visual treat for first-time visitors to the city, said Santanu Basu, project director, CEIP.

 The procedures have been finalised, and CEIP an ADB-funded project is awaiting the final nod from Delhi. We hope to begin our activities after monsoon, said Basu.

 According to the plans chalked out by the CEIP, the Park Circus Maidan will have a new pathway, a coffee and ice-cream parlour and a flower garden. A fountain of drinkable water and a park for women and children will be created, and the lighting arrangements will be overhauled. 

 We will also reconstruct the worn-out railings and boundary walls. The drainage system of the playground will be improved, said a CEIP official . 

 Similar plans are afoot for the beautification of Rabindra Kanan. A new open-air stage, with arrangements for after-dark performances, a flower garden and a fountain will be created. 

 Trees, pathways, flower gardens and benches will encircle the waterways, which will be cleaned of the waste now dumped in them, added the official.

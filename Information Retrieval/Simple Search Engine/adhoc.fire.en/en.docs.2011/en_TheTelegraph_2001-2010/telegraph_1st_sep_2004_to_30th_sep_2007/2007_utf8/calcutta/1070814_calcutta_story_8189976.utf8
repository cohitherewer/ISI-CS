 Mother abandons newborn

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A woman fled from a hospital in Kamarhati, on the northern fringes, on Sunday morning, a day after giving birth to a girl child. 

 The baby was found lying on her mothers bed wrapped in white cloth.

 According to police, the woman, in her early 20s, identified herself as Asha Devi while taking admission at Sagar Dutta Memorial Hospital on August 8.

 A man, who identified himself as Rajesh Kumar, signed the necessary papers as her husband, said a hospital official.

 The hospital authorities informed Belghoria police station. We went to the address in Belghoria provided by the two in the hospital register and found it was fake, said an officer. We even searched the adjoining localities, but no one could provide us with any lead.

 Asha had a normal delivery. She nursed the baby on Saturday. Rajesh had also come to meet her. The other patients did not find anything odd in their behaviour. Around 6am on Sunday, nurses noticed the baby crying alone, said the official. 

 Several women patients of the hospital offered to adopt the baby. The sub-divisional officer of Barrackpore, J. Chatterjee, however, said: We will send the baby to a state-run home and interested people will have to apply to the court to adopt the baby.

 Art and society

 The crossroads where art and politics meet is almost always difficult to negotiate. Trained in both India and Paris, for many years Probir Gupta practised a refined form of abstract painting, rigorous yet distant from his interests in Marxist thinking and subaltern discourse. From mid-1990s onwards, he began to forge a route from which he could address the subjects of human rights, civics, class and communal tensions or labour relations through forms, materials and images. These multiple influences fused his art into expressions of expanded scope, vision and scale. His paintings are some of the most ambitious, in both size and subject, while his sculptures are increasingly experimental and challenging. Found Objects, the ongoing show of his paintings, installations and mixed media works, documents the efforts of an inquiring mind, the physical manifestations of an artists attempt to agitate the surface of both a complacent social sphere and a conservative art market. Hosted by Anant Art Gallery.

 Event: Paintings, installations and mixed media works by Probir Gupta When: Till March 20; 12 noon - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts (all galleries)

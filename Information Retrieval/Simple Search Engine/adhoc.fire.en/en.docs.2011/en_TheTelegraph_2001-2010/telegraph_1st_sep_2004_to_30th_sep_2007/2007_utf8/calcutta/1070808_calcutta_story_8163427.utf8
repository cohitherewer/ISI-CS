 Oxytown accused to file appeal 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The lawyers of Lakshmi Narayan Chakraborty, the prime accused in the Oxytown murder case, said on Tuesday that they will move an appeal against Mondays order of Calcutta High Court.

 Chakraborty and Chandan Das, a co-accused in the case, have been ordered to surrender before the trial court within seven days. They were acquitted in March.

 The duo had allegedly wiped out a family of four in Oxytown, Thakurpukur, on June 9, 1999. The decomposed bodies of Sohini Pal, her sister Triparna and their parents, Manjulika and Bidyut, were found five days later.

 Chakrabortys lawyers, Dipankar Ghosh and Amitava Roy, said they had not received a copy of the order. We will go through it and decide on our course of action, said Ghosh.

 Chakraborty, who left home on Monday morning, has not yet returned. I have been trying to contact my husband over his cellphone but in vain, said Kalpana, Chakrabortys wife.

 Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), said his men would comply with the court order as soon as it reaches us.

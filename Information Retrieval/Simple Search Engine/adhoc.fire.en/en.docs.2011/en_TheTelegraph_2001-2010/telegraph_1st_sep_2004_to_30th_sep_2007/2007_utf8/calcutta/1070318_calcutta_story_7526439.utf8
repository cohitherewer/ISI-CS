 Blue billion and a bully 

 The Pepsi World Cup commercial is gripping, but blurs the line between encouragement and heckling

 AdLib Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 May I have your attention please? Every single ad that you see is making this plea to you. Some you turn your head to, others get only a fleeting glance. There are quite a few that are overlooked partly because you do not fancy them and partly because your mind wants to ease the information load. The advertiser is well aware of this traffic jam in your mind and that is why he tries so hard to grab a moment in your mind. 

 It is this anxiety that is driving advertisers more and more. Use of celebrities has thus become the flavour of the season. Others are coming up with storylines that make you sit up. A combination of the two, celebrities in a gripping script, is deadly. 

 But is it always that? Witness the Pepsi ad launched on the occasion of the cricket World Cup. Yes, this is the same ad which starts with Sachin picking up a bottle of Pepsi and turning to offer it to his teammates Rahul, Sehwag, Dhoni et al. A kid snatches the bottle and a battle begins. Dhoni is heckled, Sehwag is manhandled. Presumably chasing the precious Pepsi bottle (why else would such stars take such huge risks?), they reach what definitely looks like a railway platform.

 It is deserted. Suddenly they discover the crowd on the overbridge. The crowd takes off their overwear to disclose their identity. They are the blue billion the fan club of the Indian team. They spur the stars to fight and a group of tigers leave the cricket field. The tagline says you win only if you fight. The message the blue (Indian colour) billion (Indian population) is egging the cricket team to fight so that they win. You succeed only if you try. 

 In the early hours of the World Cup these could be words of tremendous encouragement. But it could also misfire, especially in the audience mind (the cricketers are already in the West Indies). There is a constant tension between the cricketers and the fans. The way the players are heckled, many would interpret it as hostility. In the final sequence, where the blue billion is disclosed, the chant appears to be urging the cricketers to fight the fans rather than other teams. Even the tigers leaving the cricket field probably cannot salvage the damage done. The sentiment of encouragement is probably lost. This Pepsi film runs the risk of misinterpretation. 

 Yet, the film is very striking. The celebrity presence and the drama in the script do not allow the viewer to overlook it. It grabs the attention, which is likely to be the problem. Indeed, the ad concentrates so much on seeking attention that the creators may have become a tad careless about the feeling that the film leaves.

 Finally, when you tell some one to get up and go for it, you assume that he is relaxing. What were we, the blue billion, doing when Rahul and each one of his teammates were in their 24th lap early in the morning?

 Rules eased for mutation 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Good news for over a lakh flat- owners who have so long been denied mutation by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on the ground that the arrear tax of the mother plot has not been cleared. They will get mutation from August by paying their proportionate share of the arrear tax only.

 For example, if 10 flats come up on a plot and if a total of Rs 2.5 lakh of property tax has remained unpaid to the CMC, an individual flat-owner can get the flat mutated in his name just by paying up his proportionate share of Rs 25,000 of arrear tax. 

 The mutation will be allowed even if owners of the other nine flats do not pay their respective shares of the arrear tax, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 The Left Front board in the CMC, led by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, is introducing a bunch of policy reforms relating to adjustment and refund, no outstanding certificate (NOC), transfer of pro-rata share to child assessee, dishonoured cheques and waiver scheme from next month to give tax payers some relief.

 As of now, in case of a dispute over payment or adjustment, the onus lies on the house-owner to prove that he has already made the payment or deserves adjustment.

 The details of the policy order will be posted on the civic authorities website soon after it is passed by the civic house this month. 

 The policy was passed by the mayoral council meeting last week.

 The municipal commissioner said that according to the new policy, the relation between the CMC and tax payers will be complementary. If a tax payer produces documents to the effect that he has actually paid his dues though the civic record does not show it, the particular house-owner will be exonerated from the charge of being a defaulter.

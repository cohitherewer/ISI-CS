 Girl drugged, abducted

 - Passerby rescues abandoned 12-year-old, police and family clueless

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 12-year-old schoolgirl was found wandering in a drugged state on Bondel Road on Friday, two hours after she had disappeared from the Tiljala neighbourhood where she lives. 

 Nazia Parveen had left her Roycharan Ghosh Road home around 8.15 am to buy snacks from a neighbourhood shop. 

 She goes to the shop everyday to buy her tiffin. She was supposed to come back from the shop in a couple of minutes, put on her uniform and leave for school, said Saina Khatoon, the girls mother.

 When Nazia did not return after 15 minutes, we started looking for her. But she was nowhere to be seen, she added. Nazias father Shabbir Hussain deals in hardware.

 Two hours later, the girl found herself on Bondel Road. She sought help from passer-by Kaushalya Biswas, who lives in the area. Biswas called up Nazias home. 

 Her family members rushed to the spot, about two kilometres from Tiljala, and took her home.

 Police havent made headway into the case. Nazias family members said they did not receive any ransom call. We could not talk to the girl because she was sleeping, said superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta.

 Nazia could not recall what exactly had happened. I first went to the snack shop, but the owner was not at the counter. I started walking to another shop, a few metres away. An uncle came up to me and offered to help me buy food. He then took out a handkerchief and pressed it to my nose. I cannot remember what happened after that, the girl told her family members.

 She also said: I can vaguely recall being in an autorickshaw with the uncle. After we got down, he gave me a bottle of water and disappeared.

 Nazia then turned to Biswas for help. I was going to the market, when someone tugged at my anchal and called me kakima (aunt), said Biswas. I turned around and saw a shivering girl. She asked me if the road led to Sealdah. I asked her if she was alone. She said she was with an uncle who had disappeared.

 Biswas alerted the local shopkeepers. We called up Karaya police, said Dipak Pal, who owns a shop on the road.

 Kidnap cases are not uncommon in the area. Sandeep Singh, who studies in Class VI, has been missing from his Bondel Road residence since April 24. Sandeep lives in the area where Nazia was wandering. He had left home to escort his younger brother to a nursery school in the neighbourhood, but did not return. We have not received a ransom call yet, said Gurbinder Kaur, Sandeeps aunt.

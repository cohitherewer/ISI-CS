 Flight path: The reduction in airline ticket prices has fuelled many a common mans dream of flying 

 Apropos the report Air fares go crashing, February 21, it is great that the air fares have come down significantly. Airlines are being forced to scale down their ticket prices to remain in competition with low-cost, no-frills carriers. The fall in fares will not only save money for frequent fliers, but also will allow many a common man to fulfil their long cherished dream of flying.

 The report Honesty of jobless youth, February 21, was heartwarming. The incident might appear insignificant, but it provides an insight into what makes Calcutta tick. The 24-year-old unemployed youth who found Rs 25,000 in a near-empty bus could easily have taken it home. But he chose to hand it over to police. Even the cop was moved by the youths honesty. All those who feel like giving up on the city only need to remember such heroic acts to draw hope. 

 P.B. Saha,

 Salt Lake. 

 The report Honesty of jobless youth, February

 21, made for a wonderful read. By handing over a packet containing Rs 25,000

 to police, the youth has set an example. He should be rewarded for his

 honesty. Corruption has now permeated every level of society, but we still

 read reports of beggars, rickshaw-pullers and taxi-drivers returning packets

 of cash and valuables. This proves that poverty cannot make people dishonest.

 Those who are basically honest can overcome any temptation. They would

 rather fight poverty than surrender to corruption. Our society needs more

 people like that.

 The report Benefactor trust betrayed, February 16, reveals the real picture of a consumerist society. The murder of the middle-aged woman for money is shocking and raises questions about how safe we are in our own homes.

 Stop that: A convoy of cars with

 Apropos the City Diary item Smoking Vigil, February 21, it is a welcome initiative of the Calcutta University to seek the help of police to ban smoking on the campus. Smoking is a dangerous habit and all effort should be made to discourage it.

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report Cooking up an airy mess, February 15, the mayors decision to ban cooking on the pavement is laudable. But the ban should have been implemented long back. Environmentalists raised a hue and cry over holding the Book Fair on the Maidan, but are quite okay about food being cooked and sold on the pavement. The practice also causes pollution besides creating terrible problems for pedestrians. The hawkers are almost impossible to dislodge. I hope the mayor finds a way to discipline them. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road. 

 Apropos the report Signboard in Bengali, February 21, it is heartening to see that organisations like Bangla Bhasa Prosar Samity are convincing the government to use Bengali in official documents. The initiative by the civic body to introduce Bengali on signboards of shops is a welcome move. Other municipal corporations in the state should follow suit. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Bandpur, Hooghly. 

 Apropos the report Parking lot unveil, February 16, car-owners will be pleased about the development. They are regularly fleeced and harassed by people posing as parking lot attendants. 

 Hefty fees are charged by these unscrupulous people in the guise of parking lot attendants even in free parking zones. They produce fake civic body receipts at the drop of a hat. The administration needs to crack down on these imposters . 

 Anil Kumar Sen,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. 

 Apropos the report Light turns red for red light, February 24, the misuse of beacons is a common nowadays. The high court is justified in passing the order. It should be implemented immediately. 

 Ronita Dutta,

 Jadavpur.

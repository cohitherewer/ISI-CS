 Celebration of culture

 For close to one and a half centuries, the Prinsep Memorial, a symbol of the citys colonial legacy, has stood witness to the citys growth and evolution as a hub of cultural activity. Hosted by HSBC and INTACH, the Prinsep Ghat Cultural Festival is a prestigious event that premieres choreographies in two major Indian classical dance styles. Both productions, built around specific themes, generate a unique interaction between the performers and the heritage monument. This evening, Anjika stages The Throw of Dice, a Manipuri presentation choreographed by Priti Patel. Portraying the truth that the world is a playground in which people are players, it depicts the way in which games played by kings affect the lives of lesser mortals. War and destruction are the consequence of playful wagers laid by kings, the sufferers being innocent women and children. Tomorrow: Wrana-Rang, a Kathak presentation inspired by Tagores Hori-Khela. Choreography: Pandit Birju Maharaj.

When: January 5 amp; 6; 6.30 pm

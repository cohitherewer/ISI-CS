 Ruling shift on damages

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A lawyer cannot claim a share of the amount his client is paid as accident benefit, ruled Justice Indira Banerjee at Calcutta High Court on Wednesday. She was hearing the petition of a truck driver who lost one of his legs in a road mishap in 2000. 

 Sheikh Aurangzeb, the driver, a resident of Dhobi Gali, on Kashinath Mukherjee Road, in the Jorasanko police station area, met with an accident at Jhargram, Midnapore, his lawyer Phiroz Edulji said.

 Aurangzeb moved the Workmens Compensation Tribunal in 2000, demanding damages. The tribunal awarded him a compensation of Rs 5,23,593 on May 6, 2007. 

 But the lawyer appearing for Aurangzeb in the tribunal case claimed that as he was fighting the case free, half the amount should be paid to him. The judge awarded him Rs 1 lakh in cash and decided to pay the rest by draft, said Edulji. The lawyer has no right to claim a share of the compensation without the consent of his client, Edulji argued. 

 The ruling is significant as many subordinate court and tribunal judges pass orders directing the respondents to pay an amount of the compensation money to their lawyers.

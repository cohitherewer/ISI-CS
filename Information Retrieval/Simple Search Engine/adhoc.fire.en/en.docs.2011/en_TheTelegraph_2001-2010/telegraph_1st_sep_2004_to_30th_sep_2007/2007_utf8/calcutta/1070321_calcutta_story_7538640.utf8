 A four-day extravaganza has been organised in the city to celebrate the third edition of Rajasthan Diwas, which commemorates the birth of the desert state from the princely province of Rajputana. 

 The event, showcasing the art and culture of Rajasthan, will kick off at Bengal Rowing Club and Hindusthan Club on March 30.

 At the meet to announce the programme, Speaker of the Rajasthan Assembly Sumitra Singh recounted the states history. She also spoke about the need to be proud of the countrys culture and heritage.

 The idea is to breach the growing divide between communities inhabiting the city, added H.M. Bangur, managing director of Shree Cement and president of Rajasthan Foundation, the organisers of the event.

 Also present were industrialists Harshvardhan Neotia and Sandeep Bhutoria.

 Folk performances have been lined up to celebrate the foundation day. Artistes will be flown in for the performances.

 On the anvil are shows of Kacchi Ghodi (a form in which dancers dress up as horses or mares), Bhavai (which brings alive the bravery of the bandits of the Bhavai region) and Nat-natni (the court dance).

 Foodies can sample authentic Jodhpuri Besan Guttha and Til Papdi from Mewar, whipped up by chefs from Rajasthan. The entry fee has been pegged at Rs 50, while the buffet spread is priced at Rs 150.

 Health scan on Howrah bridge

 SIMI KAMBOJ

No Howrah bridge, no Calcutta. Thats Mira Nairs one-frame philosophy in The Namesake, where every cut from New York to Calcutta is marked by a shot of the Howrah bridge.

 Realising that the iconic structure is under stress, Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) owners of the bridge has decided to put the 64-year-old connector between the twin cities of Calcutta and Howrah through a thorough health check-up.

 We want to ascertain whether the bridge is safe under the loading pattern prescribed by the Indian Roads Congress So, we have asked RITES to conduct a study, said a senior CPT official. 

 The government of India enterprise, functioning as consultants, engineers and project managers, has been given the Rs 3-crore project to scan Calcuttas famed senior citizen, formally known as Rabindra Setu.

 RITES, a consultant of the bridge for the past 25 years, will kick off the exercise by end-2007 and submit its report in 24 months.

 We are conducting a comprehensive investigation of Howrah bridge after a gap of 25 years, said the official. 

 The 1983 audit had found corrosion and distortion in over 25 locations in the structure and concluded that some parts of the bridge are over-stressed.

 In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the usage of the bridge and the load factor has also risen. With a carriageway of 71 ft, Rabindra Setu has a capacity of carrying 60,000 vehicles, but over 88,000 vehicles use it everyday. 

 In June 2005, the bridge suffered a blow when a barge hit the structure and damaged two of the six main structural members supporting the bridge deck. The bridge deck was also damaged.

 Rabindra Setu is under severe stress. Unless maintenance and overhauling is carried out on the structure and traffic load practically halved, the bridge might not remain usable in another 10 to 15 years, said a retired CPT official, now on deputation with the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners. 

 Trucks weighing up to 16 tonnes are safe. But these days, the vehicles are always overloaded, many weighing even up to 25 tonnes, said a CPT official.

 To evaluate the load factor, fully-loaded trucks will be lined up, bumper to bumper, on the entire bridge deck to study the impact and stress caused by the load. Traffic on the bridge will be closed totally during this exercise. CPT has also requested that hawkers be removed from the bridge during that period.

 RITES will place closed-circuit television and ultra-sonographic sensors on the bridge to examine its state of health. The objective is to understand the problems and initiate corrective measures, said the CPT official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fish of many parts

 Nothing goes to waste. At least in a fish. Ever seen someone extracting a grain-like substance from the severed heads of rohu or katla at a fish stall with an implement that looks like a long needle? 

 He doesnt buy the heads. But for each extraction, he pays 50 paise. He is, in fact, extracting the pituitary gland of the fish. 

 Another group collects air-bladders of the bhola-bhetki. Yet another collects all the other discarded parts, except the scales. The last group doesnt even have to pay, because it is actually cleaning the stalls. 

 The pituitary gland is used for artificial breeding of fish. Air bladders of bhola-bhetki are exported and used in the manufacture of casings of medicinal capsules.

 Europeans prefer the natural casing to the synthetic gelatine one. The refuse is the favourite food of African magurs, notorious carnivores among fish.

 Cutting-edge coffee 

 From long, long ago, before Barista was born, before CCD was a distant rumour, before Irish Coffee was so abundantly available in Calcutta, the streets had been serving it all. Coffee House is not the only place where you get good ol infusion for Rs 5. Take Mahadebdas teashop. 

 This small shop on Prafulla Sarkar Street has been serving black coffee in a small glass for 18 years. But you can have all the variations: coffee with milk, coffee with milk and sugar, coffee with no milk, but with sugar. Same for tea. Add to that lemon tea. No mean feat, considering the stall would measure about 2 ft x 4 ft. 

 Coffee connoisseurs may look down upon the variety of coffee used instant coffee but for Rs 3 for a glass this sometimes sweet and milky (and at times bitter) provides a warm welcome break from the air-conditioned confines of the offices nearby.

 A kings abode

 The Schwerings have lived at 21C Raja Santosh Road for almost five years. Now after the retirement of this German diplomat they will move to their house in Chennai, where they plan to live six months a year. The rest elsewhere or Cologne. 

 This used to be the house of Raja Santosh till 1985. It stood out by virtue of its clock tower. This zamindar family had bought the house from sahibs and the clock tower was constructed in 1912. Then the house was partitioned and what remains of that once-sprawling mansion is now dwarfed by the huge condos that surround it now. 

 The Schwerings lived in one section of it and they had the good sense to turn it into a lovely modern house which did not need air-conditioning. They never touched any of its heritage elements. The grandest feature of the house is the marble staircase adorned with two large marble urns.

 The other surviving section of the Santosh mansion was separated by a high wall and this is where the clock tower used to stand. A couple of months ago this turret was knocked down. The Schwering house and garden remained intact but it did not look the same way any longer. 

 Now the Schwerings have finished packing up, but the lady of the house, Angelika Schwering, takes comfort from the fact that this beautiful house which they had made even more beautiful will definitely last some more years, if not more. Their successor has also decided to live here. If only all buildings were this lucky.

 Spelling lesson 

 Spelling mistakes have ceased to shock. But here is a primary school in north Calcutta which seems to take pride in spelling the same words differently on different notice boards. The word kindergarten is split into two and kinder is once spelt with an a. Standard has an e at its tail-end, and etiquette has an o in place of q.

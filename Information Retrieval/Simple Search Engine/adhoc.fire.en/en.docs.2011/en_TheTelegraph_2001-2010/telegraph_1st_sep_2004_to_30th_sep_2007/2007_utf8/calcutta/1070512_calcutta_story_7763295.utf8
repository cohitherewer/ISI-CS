 Art from the music land

 The name of Maihar in Madhya Pradesh is indelibly linked with legendary figures of Indian classical music like Ustad Alauddin Khan, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, Annapurna Devi and Pandit Ravi Shankar. Since the last few years, Maihar has been the centre of an annual art workshop hosted by Gallery Sanskriti, providing opportunities for creative and social interaction among some of the countrys finest artists, in a purely aesthetic and culturally rich ambience. Last years workshop brought together seven veteran artists of Calcutta Suvaprasanna (a painting by him appears right), Ashoke Mullick, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Suhas Roy, Dipali Bhattacharya, Suman Roy and Sipra Bhattacharya with six young artists of Mumbai, Sanjay Sawant, Vanita Gupta, Ashutosh Apte, Rajshree, Prakash Waghmare and Satish Wavbre. Showcasing a vibrant and diverse flow of creativity, the ongoing exhibition features works conceived and developed at the workshop by its participants.

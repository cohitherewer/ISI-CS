 Tradition and individualism

 Demystifying conventional notions about Jamini Roys Kalighat series of paintings, TraditionModern: Bengal Art, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, drawings and sketches by the legendary artist, seeks to portray tradition in art as a stepping-stone to modernity and individualism. Kalighat patas were an invented tradition of patuas, who were essentially urban folk artists. They gave expression to icons from episodes in the puranas with elliptical sweeps of heavy contour lines, embellished with coloured parallel shades; a style that had very little sanction of any older tradition. A self-conscious individual, who had set out to realise his own artistic objectives, Jamini Roys journey into the tradition of Kalighat patas was simply an attempt to build an autonomous system of art , giving allowance to exhibit his distinctive signature. The selection of works on show clearly bear evidence to the truth that, rather than carrying forward any ancient tradition, Roys prime objective was to arrive at a non-descriptive, non-narrative art, which is capable of standing on its own through the sheer use and configuration of elements into its construction.

 lEvent: Paintings and drawings by Jamini Roy lWhen: Till June 30; 3 pm - 8 pm lWhere: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

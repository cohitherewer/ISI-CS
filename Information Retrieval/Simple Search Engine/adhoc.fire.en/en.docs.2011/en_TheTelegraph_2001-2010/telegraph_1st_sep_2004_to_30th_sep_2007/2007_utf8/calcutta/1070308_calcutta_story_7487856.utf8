 Online hazards 

 It is undoubtedly a great feeling to find someone you have been trying really hard to look for, right in front of you, and when contacting them and sending a message is just a click away, you almost get a rush!

 This is the main reason behind the increasing popularity of online dating and friendship sites like Orkut, hi5 and Fropper. Its always a relief to find that ones friend is close by. But if the person is far away, beyond the reach of telephone and you cant remember his e-mail address, these search engines help you do just that. 

 These sites often host communities, on anything from your school, college, burning issues of the day to your favourite icons. 

 So, if you know, for instance, where your friend has completed his education from, type it, and chances are that you might find him in his school community. 

 But recently there have been cases where this whole idea doesnt look pretty anymore. People put up their pictures, which can be downloaded and saved onto a personal computer. The photographs can be distorted at will using software like Photoshop. A scary thought indeed. Within the communities, you can also come across strange people, the last kind you would expect to find on the list.

 There are people who list themselves as Pakistani army officers in the list of an Indian Army community! Not that someone might give away secrets, but it does strike one as odd. 

 There are all kinds of people in the world and anything can happen when details about you are displayed on the net, accessible to one and all. 

 But if you thought that third person perspectives offered an unbiased picture, think again. You can not judge someone by the testimonials his friends have written him on Orkut (many of which might be acquired by arm-twisting a reluctant friend) or the messages in his scrapbook, and what he has to say about himself. 

 And take care not to fall for the picture. Appearances can be deceptive!

 The next time you log onto Orkut or hi5, keep these facts in mind. Keep yourself out of danger as well as embarrassment, and dont let yourself fall casualty to the marauding of unseen eyes. The Internet is a great place to be in, as long as you and your details are safe.

 Moulding characters

 Nibedita Centre for Challenged Children conducted a two-day clay modelling and painting workshop in February at their Park Circus centre.

 The workshop, the first of its kind in the organisation, encouraged the creativity of the children and helped in the co-ordination of the finger movements. Since these children are slow learners, the motive was to encourage their eye-hand motor co-ordination with clay modelling, said Sampa Roy, a school psychologist. 

 Ordinary

 clay, water and sand were used to

 make different models of animals,

 human figures, houses and jewellery.

 With no mould to work upon, children

 gave different shapes to clay with

 their hands . While eight-year-old

 Papia Das insisted on wearing the

 bangle that she made out of a chunk

 of clay, Debayan Ghosh, 20, claimed

 that his clay fish is a whale. 

 The workshop was a breather in the otherwise routined lives of the children. The element of play can be incorporated in their learning process and thats what we proved through the workshop, said Dr Tapasi Mitra, centre-in-charge and psychologist.

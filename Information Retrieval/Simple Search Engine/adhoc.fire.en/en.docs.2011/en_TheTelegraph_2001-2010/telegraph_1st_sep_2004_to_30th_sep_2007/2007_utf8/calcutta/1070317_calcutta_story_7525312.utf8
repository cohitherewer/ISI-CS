 The recently-constituted, high-powered noise monitoring committee met for the first time at Writers Buildings on Thursday and finalised an action plan to keep the decibel devils in check. 

 I will write to senior police officers and apprise them of the decisions taken, said state environment secretary and chairman of the committee M.L. Meena. Under the central noise act, police are responsible for penalising the violators.

 It had been decided earlier that the primary function of the panel would be to coordinate among the pollution control board, police and the district administration.

 Police and the pollution control board would jointly monitor noise pollution in sensitive areas, including schools, and the offenders would be booked instantly, added Meena. 

 The board had found in a study near Minto Park that school students were the most affected by the noise of vehicles and honking. 

 Those using air horns will be punished severely, said the environment secretary.

 The panel, with representatives from the environment department, pollution control board and police, has also agreed on the need to enforce the Supreme Courts order on noise pollution control in a more stringent manner, said senior law officer of the environment department and member-secretary of the panel Biswajit Mukherjee. The order covered vehicular and industrial noise and use of loudspeakers and fireworks. 

 I hope the decisions dont remain only on paper, was the reaction of a green activist to the development.

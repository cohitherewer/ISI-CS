 Placement cry on campus

 - Students protest CU apathy to make contact with recruiters

 MITA MUKHERJEE

At a time when B-schools and tech schools across the country are leaving no stone unturned to place their graduates in topnotch corporate houses, Calcutta University is leaving its bright young brains to fend for themselves. 

 Fed up with the apathy of the authorities to their long-standing demand for a placement cell, students of the universitys Rajabazar Science College campus have launched an indefinite movement, starting this week.

 We will continue our movement till the university takes a concrete measure and sets up a placement unit with conference room, group discussion facilities and adequate staff to coordinate with corporate houses, said Abhishek Sengupta, a student leader. 

 Most engineering institutions have full-fledged placement cells. The placement cell at Jadavpur University works round the year to identify potential employers. 

 But to date, placement through campus interviews at Calcutta University have taken place on the personal initiative of some teachers, who keep in touch with potential employers and follow up whenever the companies approach them for recruiting fresh graduates.

 As a stop-gap arrangement, the university had appointed a placement coordinator, who worked as the single-point contact with the corporate houses. 

 Big companies like TCS, CTS, IBM and Haldia Petrochemicals have offered lucrative jobs to our students in the past two years But we do not know what will happen this year, said Biswajit Kamilla, president of the students union at Calcutta Universitys Rajabazar Science College. 

 The SFI-led union is steering the agitation, sparked off by resignation of the placement coordinator apparently on grounds of the authoritys lack of interest in the cell. 

 In four months, the final batches will passBut the authorities have not yet started any communication with the companies for placement interviews, said a student. 

 The university has over 500 students in B.Tech and M.Tech courses in streams like radio physics, electronics and communications and computer science and engineering. 

 Calcutta University registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay admitted that the students had a point. It is a matter of concern for us that campus interviews for the batch of 2007 have not been finalised. We have convened a meeting on Monday to resolve the crisis, he said.

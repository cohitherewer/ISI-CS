 Ailing get rights in hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

To prevent the innocent from being duped by doctors, Ruby General Hospital has introduced patients bill of rights.

 A hospital is bound to give its patients certain rights. In Calcutta, patients are hardly aware of these rights. As a result, in many cases, they cannot enjoy the rights. Therefore, we have empowered our patients with these rights, said hospital founder-chairman Kamal Kumar Dutta.

 Besides, in order to cater to more patients and offer them better services, Ruby General Hospital is planning to expand its area and facilities. 

 At present, the hospital has 150 beds. The capacity will be double by 2008, hospital officials said. 

 We are investing more than Rs 10 crore in this expansion project. The new wing will come up in the same area, off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, added Dutta. 

 The new wing will house super-speciality maternity, paediatric and trauma-care units. A nursing training school will also take off by July. Initially, we will train 40 students a year. The response will determine the future, added Dutta. 

 He held out the assurance that in coming years, services at the hospital will be available at reasonable rates. We are taking a number of steps to slash our treatment costs. Our aim is to give quality healthcare facilities at a lower cost, which will be at least five per cent less than other private hospitals, claimed the chairman.

 The hospital is also planning to rope in specialists from the US for patients in city. Calcutta lags behind many cities in the healthcare sector. By bringing in specialist from abroad, our patients can avail of international-standard services right here. It will be a boon for the states healthcare, signed off Dutta.

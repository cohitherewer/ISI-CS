 The Rs 4,500-crore Kolkata West International City (KWIC), the first real estate project in the state with 100 per cent foreign direct investment, has included on board Bengal Unitech Universal to add marketing muscle and for better logistics.

 Yes, Bengal Unitech Universal Ltd (BUUL) is doing the marketing for KWIC and purchasing materials for the project. However, there is no dilution of equity from the Salim Group in the venture and the investment and planning remain the responsibility of the overseas consortium, Prasoon Mukherjee, chairman of the Jakarta-based Universal Success Group, told Metro on Friday. 

 NRI businessman Mukherjees Universal Success is a partner in the tripartite venture of KWIC, coming up on 390 acres off NH 6 and abutting on Howrah-Amta Road. The Salim Group and the Ciputra Group are the other partners in the consortium. Bengal Unitech Universal is a 50:50 joint venture between Unitech Ltd and Universal Success, and is developing UniWorld City, the 100-acre residential complex and Infospace, the 50-acre IT park, in Rajarhat.

 Mukherjee said the decision to involve Bengal Unitech Universal in the west Howrah complex, for project management and technical consultancy, was only a logical progression. I have a company which is developing 15 million sq ft in Rajarhat (residential and IT), 10 million sq ft on the Kona Expressway (the logistics hub) and another 10 million sq ft in the New Town convention centre. Since Im buying that much cement and steel, if I combine the purchase of KWIC, I get better prices and save a lot of money, he said.

 The first phase of the west Howrah project, spanning 80 acres and comprising 840 bungalows, is expected to be completed by end-2008. We will probably alter plans and do the next phases as highrises to save on scarce land, said Mukherjee. KWIC will also have branded and shop-house retail, a hospital, schools and a sports-and-leisure club spread across 11 acres.

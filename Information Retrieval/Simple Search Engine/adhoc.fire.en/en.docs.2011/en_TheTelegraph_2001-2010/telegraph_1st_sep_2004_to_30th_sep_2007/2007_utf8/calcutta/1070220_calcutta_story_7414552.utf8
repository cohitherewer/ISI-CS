 Spurned teenager in acid attack

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Howrah teenager, spurned in love by his teacher, who is nine years his senior, hounded her for one-and-a-half-years and threw acid on her face on Sunday night, a month before her marriage.

 Imtiaz Khan, 18, wanted to marry his 27-year-old neighbour Anjum (name changed) in Bally, Howrah. She, however, turned down his proposal and agreed to a match arranged by her family. 

 An infuriated Imtiaz threw concentrated acid on Anjums face while she was returning to her home on Dr HK Chatterjee Street around 8 pm on Sunday. He is absconding since.

 Hearing the womans cries, some local residents and her family members rushed to her rescue. She was taken to a neighbourhood hospital, where she is admitted. 

 Anjums cheeks and parts of her throat have been badly burnt. It appears that there has been no serious damage to her eyes, but we cant say that for sure immediately, said a hospital official.

 We are looking for the teenager. The woman had apparently refused to marry him, said additional superintendent of Howrah police Milan Das. 

 Imtiaz has been threatening Anjum ever since her marriage was arranged. He had told her that if he couldnt get her, he would ensure nobody else will, said a relative of Anjums. 

 Anjum used to teach at a local higher secondary school, where Imtiaz used to study. He had developed a crush on her, stated a police officer.

 According to Anjums relatives, Imtiaz used to visit their house, but they had no idea that he harboured feelings for his teacher, who treated him like a brother. It came as a shock when we found out how Imtiaz felt about Anjum, said her maternal aunt. 

 Things started taking a turn for the worse when Imtiaz proposed marriage to Anjum 18 months ago and she summarily rejected the proposal. After that, he started accosting her on the road, whenever she would go out alone, added the aunt.

 Scared, Anjum quit her job soon after. We couldnt allow Anjum to go out, as Imtiaz was hounding her. She would cry the whole day and look dejected. So, we decided to arrange her marriage, stated Anjums brother. 

 We have found out that Imtiaz studied at the school till Class V. He then gave up studies and took up a job at a foundry. In his spare time, he used to hound Anjum, said an investigating officer. We are not sure what acid Imtiaz threw at Anjum. It appears that he had plotted the attack for some time. 

 We are ruined. What will happen to my sisters marriage? cried Anjums brother.

 She is such a nice girl. We are stunned, said Iftikar Ahmed, a neighbour.

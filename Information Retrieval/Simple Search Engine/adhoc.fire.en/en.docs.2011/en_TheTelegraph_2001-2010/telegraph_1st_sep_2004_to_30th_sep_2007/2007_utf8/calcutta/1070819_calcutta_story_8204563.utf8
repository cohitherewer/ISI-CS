 Trees on traffic path

 The problem 

 The city is on a tree-cutting spree in the name of widening its roads. The latest on the hitlist is Beleghata CIT Road once called Krishnachura Avenue for the abundance of the flowering tree.

 Recently, I noticed that the the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) workers had demolished a part of the footpath between Beleghata post office crossing and Phoolbagan, reducing it to less than half the original width. As a result, the trees and the green verge lie exposed to traffic.

 The CMC officials have unofficially said that the trees would also be cut sooner or later to increase the width of the road. There are at least a hundred trees on the stretch, including some very old ones. 

 Complaint

 When it was pointed out that there is hardly a traffic snarl on the road, the CMC officials blamed the traffic police, saying that Calcutta police has for a long time been pressing for the widening of the road. However, when, we the residents of the area contacted the traffic police, they seemed clueless about the matter.

 Officially, the CMC maintains the stand that it is yet to take any decision regarding the cutting of the trees. We fear the worst since they said the same thing while the road was being widened from the direction of Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

 The trees outside the new footpath were chopped down and only a handful of those were replanted in a nearby park. The same thing has happened in various other stretches of the city. We urge the administration to refrain from cutting trees and adding to the pollution.

 What CMC should do

 Identify the roads that need widening through a survey with relevant agencies like Calcutta police.

 Find a way to increase the effective width of the roads by removing encroachments due to hawkers and illegal parking.

 The footpaths of the roads that still need widening can be reduced but the trees must be protected and conserved. The space between two trees can be used for parking.

 If trees must be cut, there should be compensatory planting at least two monsoons before the widening project.

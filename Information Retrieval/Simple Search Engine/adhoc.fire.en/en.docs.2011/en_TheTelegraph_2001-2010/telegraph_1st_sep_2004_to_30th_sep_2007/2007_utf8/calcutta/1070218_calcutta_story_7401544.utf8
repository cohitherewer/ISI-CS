The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Code of the old world order

 A New Years Eve at Calcutta Club, where women are still not allowed as independent members. A Telegraph picture 

 Dalhousie Institute (DI) has a funny rule going (and this is the recently amended version). Men are allowed to enter the main bar and lounge dressed in shorts only till 6 pm, after which they must change in the dressing room, into full pants and collar wear, says Kumar Mitra, convener of the entertainment committee, DI. 

 Which means that a change of clothes and an eye on your watch must accompany a day out at the Jhowtalla Road Club. Women are free to move about in their shorts and slippers any time and anywhere in the club, Mitra smiles. Looks like women get away with anything. But then again, if women didnt dress down, it would mean no crowd post 6 pm! 

 On the online rulebook of RCTC it is stated that membership can be terminated if the member is a subject or a citizen of a country at war with the Union of India. What can the poor guy do if his country has decided to go to battle? It may not be his choice. 

 The race gets tougher. At Saturday Club, a member can sign in a guest only four times a month (which includes the spouse). At CC amp;FC, it is a little more relaxed with the count going up to not more than eight times in a month that a member can introduce a guest. Thats encouraging constant, devoted spouses and partners to adopt several false names or go in disguise. 

 From membership rules move on to dress code rules. Playing a sport means sporting comfortable gear, does colour really count? But at Calcutta South Club, the dress code for tennis players is the colour white. Anwar Ali, tennis coach at Calcutta South Club, feels: We practise a discipline that is close to the standards of the Wimbledon. Hey, all you fashionable free-handers out there you could always change into that lil black dress once youre done wearing the lil white one!

 At Bengal Club, by rule, there are different types of members. Two categories stand out: town members (those who live in Calcutta) and mofussil members (members who live in Delhi, Mumbai or elsewhere). This dates back to the days when Calcutta was the centre of the British Raj and the rest of the country was regarded as the backwaters, says a spokesperson from the club, with a twinkle in his eye.

 At the century-old Calcutta Club, things go a step further. By an age-old rule, women cannot be independent members. At the onset of its centenary year, the club is bringing in many changes, including a new look in the hall and a limitless entertainment menu. Hopefully it will shed the traditional taboo against allowing womens membership, too!

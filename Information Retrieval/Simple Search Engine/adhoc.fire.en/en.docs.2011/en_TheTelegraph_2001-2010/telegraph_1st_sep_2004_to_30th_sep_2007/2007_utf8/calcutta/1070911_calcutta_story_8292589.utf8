 Rash auto takes a tumble

 JULIUS GOMES

 On the way to office, I took an autorickshaw to Gol Park from Jadavpur police station on the afternoon of September 4. I was sitting at the back, in the left corner.

 The three-wheeler wove through the traffic and approached Dhakuria bridge at full speed. All four passengers requested the auto driver a thick-set man in his 30s to slow down, but in vain.

 Once on the bridge, he started overtaking vehicles with a vengeance. Suddenly, the auto swerved to the left and crashed into a car, probably a Maruti 800, smashing its tail light. Then, the auto overturned, toppling over on its left side.

 I tried to protect my head with my arms, but as the three-wheeler skidded along, the side of my face hit the ground with a thud. Everything went dark.

 The next thing I remember were some muffled voices. Slowly, my eyes focused on a crowd that had gathered. I could make out the driver of the car we had hit shouting at the auto driver. There were also some police officers from Lake police station, I later learnt.

 I had been flung out of the auto, which was lying on its side, a few feet away. Two young men helped me into another auto and took me to AMRI Hospital nearby. I blacked out on the way.

 I regained consciousness on a hospital bed with doctors and policemen looking at me and nurses tending to my injuries. One of the doctors was apprehensive about an injury close to my left temple. He asked me to watch out for anything abnormal for the next month, before allowing me to leave. I had no broken bones, but extensive muscle and ligament injuries along with severe cuts and bruises.

 You had a miraculous escape, said the sub-inspector who took my statement.

 In the absence of administrative checks, only a miracle can save us from the anarchy of autos.

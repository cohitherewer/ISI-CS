The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Private scan on bidders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has undertaken a drive to usher in better transparency in selecting a bidder for a project.

 In the new system, the agency will no longer be involved in shortlisting the bidders. Instead, it has hired a private firm, Bengal CES, to list the bidders for a project based on their experience, technical expertise, financial capability and other criteria.

 A marking system has been evolved for preparing the list.

 The CMDA will issue the offer letter to the firm topping the Bengal CES list. If the firm refuses to take up work, the one next in line will be considered.

 Our aim is to select the lowest bidder with the required capabilities, said Debdas Bhattacharjee, chief engineer in the CMDAs traffic and transportation section.

 Earlier, the bidders were selected by a committee comprising technical experts and senior CMDA officials. The previous system was quite effective, but the new one will usher in better transparency, Bhattacharjee claimed.

 The new system will select the bidder for the flyover from the EM Bypass to Kazi Nazrul Islam Sarani (VIP Road). The Rs 72-crore flyover will be funded by the Centre (under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission), state government and the CMDA. The system will also be followed in the tendering process of the flyover from Parama Island to Park Circus Bridge No. 4 and the Vivekananda Road flyover.

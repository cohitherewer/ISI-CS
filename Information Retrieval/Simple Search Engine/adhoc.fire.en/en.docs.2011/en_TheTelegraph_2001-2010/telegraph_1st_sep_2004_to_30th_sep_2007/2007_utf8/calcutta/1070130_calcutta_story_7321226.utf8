The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Second booster station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The foundation stone of the second of three water supply schemes undertaken by the Left Front civic board for 2007 will be laid on February 1.

 State finance minister Asim Dasgupta will lay the foundation stone of a booster pumping station of two-million gallons per day (MGD) capacity in Siriti, which will cater to pockets on the southwestern fringes that were added to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in 1985.

 The project to be executed by Kirloskar Brothers will call for an investment of Rs 17.5 crore, which will include setting up the booster station and laying pipelines, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Monday.

 The foundation stone of the first project a three-MGD booster station in Daspara, on the south-western fringes was laid by Union minister S. Jaipal Reddy early this month. The project cost was pegged at Rs 38.12 crore.

 The third scheme is a 30-MGD water treatment plant, to be set up in Dhapa at a cost of Rs 98.75 crore. Tenders for the project have been floated and the foundation stone is likely to be laid in March.

 The mayor is also considering taking up a Rs 500-crore water supply infrastructure project under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. The scheme laying a 26-km, big-diameter alternative lifeline connecting Calcutta with Palta waterworks is likely to roll out before the Pujas.

 The projected expenses of the Left Front board to augment the water supply system in the city will cross the expenditure incurred by the previous Trinamul Congress board, which was around Rs 400 crore.

 From 2001-2005, the Subrata Mukherjee-led board had set up seven booster stations and augmented the capacity of the Palta waterworks by 80 million gallons.

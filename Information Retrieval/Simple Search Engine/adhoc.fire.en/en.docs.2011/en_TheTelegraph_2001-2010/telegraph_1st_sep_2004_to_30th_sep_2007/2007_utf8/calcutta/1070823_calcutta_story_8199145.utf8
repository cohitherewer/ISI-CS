 Confusion over JEE shift

 - Students suffer as board drags feet over changes in format

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thousands of Plus II students preparing for the joint entrance examination (JEE) are in a fix, as the government is yet to finalise the changes in the admission system of medical and engineering colleges.

 The changes scrapping the JEE is a possibility are being considered to prevent a repeat of the recent medical entrance scam.

 While the JEE is usually held in April, sources in the government said the new system is not likely to be announced before October this year.

 Which means if the government retains the test but makes some changes in the question pattern, the students will get only five months to prepare according to the new system.

 We have no clue how to prepare for JEE. There is not much time left for the test, if it is held at all, said a Plus II student of a Park Street school, who wants to become a doctor.

 I had taken admission to a JEE coaching centre a year ago and have already paid Rs 35,000. If the changes in the admission procedure are not announced right now, the money will go waste, she added.

 The changes the government is considering include:

 Scrapping the JEE and admitting students on the basis of their Plus II marks

 Holding separate tests for medical and engineering streams

 Replacing multiple-choice questions (introduced in 2005) with short answer-type questions.

 Tushar Banerjee (name changed), a Class XII student of a Ballygunge school, said he has been practising multiple-choice questions for the past few months. Barely eight months are left for JEE 2008. If the government changes the question format, its time they announced it, said Tushar.

 Satarupa Mondal (name changed), whose son is a Plus II student of South Point High School, said: I have paid Rs 7,000 to a coaching centre for model multiple-choice questions for JEE. Now, the tutors are saying the questions will be of no use. The confusion is hampering my sons studies.

 Government officials, however, pleaded helplessness in making an early announcement about the changes. We will be able to formalise the system only after receiving a report from the JEE board. The board will review the present system at a meeting in the first week of September and submit the report by the end of the month, said a higher education department official.

 For now, JEE board member-secretary Bidyut Bhattacharya advised students to prepare according to the existing system. There is no order from the government about any change.

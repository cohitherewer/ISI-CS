The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bomb scare at bank door

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Traffic on Raja Subodh Mullick Road, in Jadavpur, the chief ministers constituency, was disrupted for nearly three hours on Thursday after a bomb scare. Around 10.30 am, a customer of the Jadavpur branch of UCO Bank noticed a bomb-like item on the staircase. He informed the bank officials, who called up Jadavpur police. A bomb squad was sent.

 The cops found a plastic box with excreta inside. Two wires were sticking out of the box, giving it the appearance of a bomb. The box was burnt.

 Clash arrest: Youth Congress leader Sajal Ghosh and two others were arrested on Thursday for their alleged involvement in a clash between the partys cadre and activists of the Trinamul Congress off the Sealdah flyover on Wednesday night. On Thursday, Congress supporters, allegedly led by Sajal, hurled bombs and damaged a fast-food stall.

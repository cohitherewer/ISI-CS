The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Toll almost double on new bridge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The toll on the Second Vivekananda Setu will be nearly double that on Vidyasagar Setu. 

 And theres no chance of the toll being reduced on the soon-to-be-commissioned link between north Calcutta and Howrah, the company that built it has told the government. 

 In a letter to public works department minister Kshiti Goswami, officials of the Second Vivekananda Setu Tollway Company pointed out that it had invested Rs 900 crore in the project and has 30 years to recover the amount.

 The bridge will have to be handed over to the government after 30 years.

 Goswami had last week written to the company authorities requesting them to charge toll on a par with Vidyasagar Setu. The companys letter was in response to the request.

 The high toll is going to hit heavy goods vehicles hard. Trucks with more than six wheels will not be allowed to ply on Howrah bridge once the Second Vivekananda Setu is commissioned, the transport department declared in a notification earlier this month. 

 Satyajit Majumdar, general secretary of the Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Association, the mother organisation of heavy goods vehicles in the state, said he would move court if the government forced heavy vehicles off Vivekananda Setu (Bally bridge) and Howrah bridge.

 Trucks will only be able to take Vidyasagar Setu and the new bridge, both of which have toll, to cross the Hooghly.

 We had approached the minister after the PWD declared that plying of goods vehicles will be restricted on Vivekananda Setu once the new bridge is commissioned, said Majumdar.

 According to him, truckers cannot afford Rs 240 for a return passage on the Second Vivekananda Bridge.

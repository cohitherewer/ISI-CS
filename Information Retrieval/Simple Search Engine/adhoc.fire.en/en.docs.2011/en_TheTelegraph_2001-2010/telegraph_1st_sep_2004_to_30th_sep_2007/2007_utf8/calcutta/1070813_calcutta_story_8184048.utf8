 A casual observation overheard seven years ago at a meeting in Johannesburg has inspired an exhaustive documentary on global water scarcity.

 Film-maker and Miami University professor Sanjeev Chatterjee decided to produce One Water after hearing a stray comment that the next world war will be fought over water. He directed the film with colleague Ali Habashi. 

 The 66-minute documentary shot in 14 countries, including India took over five years to make. Several foundations, United Nations Development Programme and the university supported the project.

 Media institute NIMC recently organised a preview of the film in the city, the first outside the United States. The world premiere is scheduled for the end of this year.

 We should not forget that water is a finite natural resource. One Water is meant to spread awareness about the global crisis of provisioning of safe potable water in a visually compelling way, Chatterjee told Metro.

 The documentary has interviews of the Dalai Lama, Robert Kennedy and Vandana Shiva. I took up the project after the shorter and non-verbal pilot proved a success, added the film-maker, who once wanted to work in Bollywood.

 He has plans to follow up the film with shorter-duration documentaries, mainly on the water policy front, to be filmed in at least five countries, including India.

 The water crisis in Rajasthan and the environmental degradation of the Hooghly figure prominently in the documentary. There are images of the river being polluted near Howrah bridge.

 The film is well-made. However, it could have been slightly shorter and more focussed. It might have touched upon a possible solution to the enormous problem, said water expert Tapas Ghatak.

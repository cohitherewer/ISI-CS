The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A trip thats different and daring 

 - Adventure sports the new fad while planning annual getaways

 SANJAY MANDAL

The Daswanis love to go on tour every year, both in the country and abroad. While in Bali two years ago, the daughter of the family, Samira, developed an itch for something different, something adventurous.

 She took up a three-day crash course in scuba diving. This March, the Class XI student of La Martiniere will be in the Maldives, scuba diving in the Indian Ocean and tracking sharks.

 Now, while choosing a destination for our annual getaway, I ensure that it has lots of scope for adventure tourism, like scuba diving and parasailing, Samira smiled.

 Adventure tourism is fast becoming the fad among Calcuttans. The concept is gaining ground and is very popular among young couples and honeymooners. More and more people are buying packages that include adventure tourism, said Sachin Rampal, senior manager, corporate communications, Thomas Cook India.

 Skiing, paragliding, hang-gliding, scuba diving, bungee jumping, river rafting and trekking are no longer for a handful. In the past few years, there has been a significant shift towards destinations that have enough opportunities for adventure sports, confirmed Anil Punjabi, chairman of the Travel Agents Federation of India (eastern India).

 Adventure lovers who cannot afford to go abroad need not lose heart. For, India, too, has a fair share of spots such as Jaisalmer, Kulu and the Kumaon range for the braveheart tourist, said Punjabi.

 Although Australia and New Zealand are known as the hot spots for adventure tourism outside India, a number of tourists are now prefering Southeast Asia for the comparatively cheaper rates.

 In Phuket, Thailand, one can live aboard a ship for four days and also enjoy night diving, said Samira.

 Within India, parasailing is fast gaining popularity. The spots famous for it are Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Pushkar, all in Rajasthan.

 The joy of being aloft in the air and the thrill of defying the elements draw us to parasailing and ballooning, said an adventure enthusiast.

 Unlike in other aero sports, in these one can be on his own once off the ground, pointed out Rampal.

 India is also an ideal destination for paragliders. 

 Here, one can indulge in almost all types of paragliding over the mountains, coasts and flatland.

 An international competition in paragliding has recently been held in Billing, Himachal Pradesh.

 Kulu and Kangra valley, also in Himachal, lure hang- gliders.

 Skiing is another adventure that has gained popularity in India over the past decade. The favourite destinations are Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and the Northeast.

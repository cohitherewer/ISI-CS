 Death shadow on life term appeal

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A murder convict serving a life term could see the sentence changed to capital punishment, following his appeal in Calcutta High Court against the trial court order.

 In an unusual ruling, a high court division bench hearing the appeal asked the jailer of Presidency jail on Wednesday to produce Balaram Mondal, convicted of murdering his wife.

 The bench would like to question Mondal on September 14 to find out more about the case and decide whether he actually deserves to be hanged for his crime.

 It appears the trial court did not complete some legal formalities before awarding him the sentence. The lower court did not ask the accused why and how he killed his wife, observed the bench of Justice G.C. Gupta and Justice K.K. Prasad.

 The judges said the conviction was based on circumstantial evidence and that if Mondal is questioned properly, he might reveal details that could make the case the rarest of rare, fit for capital punishment.

 Mondal, a taxi driver, was convicted by the Alipore court of killing wife Subhra on September 24, 1997, and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2002.

 The case diary stated that that the relationship between the couple, who stayed in Santoshpur, had soured over Mondals affair with a woman, also named Subhra.

 According to the prosecution, Mondal killed his wife for the other woman. He took her body to his ancestral house in Bhowanipore in his taxi and hid it under a cot. Police later recovered the body. 

 A case was started after Mondals father-in-law Suresh Sarkar lodged a complaint with Kalighat police station.

 Mondals appeal in the high court was moved by Jayanta N. Chatterjee.

 Legal experts dubbed Wednesdays ruling an unusual order, as seldom does the court ask the convict to be produced during the hearing of an appeal plea. 

 The high court usually goes through papers related to the trial. Todays order is significant as the court felt it necessary to hear out a convict before deciding on his appeal, said junior standing counsel Subrata Mukhopadhaya.

 Criminal lawyers, however, pointed out that the Criminal Procedure Code has a provision empowering high court judges to summon convicts before delivering a verdict on a sentence of the lower court.

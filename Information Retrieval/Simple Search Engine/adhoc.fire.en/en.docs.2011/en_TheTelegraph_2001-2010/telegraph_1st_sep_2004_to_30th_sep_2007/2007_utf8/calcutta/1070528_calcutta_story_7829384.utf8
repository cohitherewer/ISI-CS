 Less damage to the hips

 - A replacement surgery that can benefit young patients

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A hip replacement surgery that minimises damage and ensures faster recovery and shorter hospital stay, recently performed in the city, holds out hope for a wide range of patients, including the younger segment, doctors feel.

 The surgery was performed on a 68-year-old woman with hip arthritis at the Howrah Orthopaedic Hospital earlier this month, using a hip implant, specifically designed to preserve more of her bone and soft tissues.

 This hip replacement procedure is custom-designed for a minimally invasive surgery. It minimises muscle and tissue damage during a replacement procedure, Ian Learmonth, a British expert on joint replacement surgery, tells Metro.

 Learmonth, director of the Bristol Implant Research Centre who along with Italian orthopaedic surgeon Francesco Saverio Santori designed the implant (Proxima) was in town for the surgery. 

 He feels it could be a boon for patients with avascular necrosis, osteo-arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, particularly the young.

 Earlier, hip replacement surgery was only for the old and the infirm. But this prosthesis, which gives you a more natural bone-loading regime, will be suitable for a host of young patients, he says. 

 Patients with chronic pain and destructive arthritis of their hip joint, who dont respond to other medical therapies, are prime candidates for a total hip replacement.

 In this surgery, more bone is preserved, since the size of the implant is smaller than the conventional ones. The stem uses a round-the-corner technique, which helps preserve muscle and soft tissue, says orthopaedic surgeon Chandan Pathak, who was in the team performing the procedure.

 Experts say the design helps the implant achieve a more natural and anatomically correct distribution of weight to the thighbone and an increased longevity. It also eliminates thigh pain. The implant allows the thighbone to bend in a more physiological manner.

 It should provide maximum benefit to the 25-55 age group, since effective motion can be achieved quickly after this implant, adds Learmonth, who sees a huge emerging market in the Asia-Pacific. A total hip replacement is expected to provide pain relief to 90 to 95 per cent of patients. 

 Vikash Kapoor, senior consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the Armenian Church Trauma Centre, agrees that this prosthesis is the future of hip-joint replacement procedures.

 Proxima can really benefit young Indian patients, if there can be a size accommodation to suit the average physical structure here, says Kapoor. 

 Learmonth has trained surgeons worldwide on conservative hip arthroplasty, tribology and high-performance bearings. He currently runs a medical training camp in Chennai and hopes to return to Calcutta soon with concrete collaborations to reach out to a wider patient base.

 Different shades: Bangladesh

 The report Gun drama at clinic, March 15, reminded one of a crime thriller. How could an armed gang of relatives storm AMRI hospital and whisk away a patient admitted for a week, on a trolley from the second floor of the general ward, holding the employees at gunpoint without paying the treatment bill? 

 There are no words to condemn the goons who disrupted treatment of other patients too. Perhaps the hospital employees and the security men on duty at the gate hardly had an alternative, other than allowing the patient to be taken away by the gang who threatened to open fire, if resisted. 

 Just beefing up security by deploying more guards at night and other stringent security measures perhaps would not suffice to stop such incidents. The state government has to come forward and stringently discipline the unruly relatives of the patients who often run amok in hospitals.

 With reference to the report Boys in green with hearts, April 2, its gratifying to see the Bangladesh team, considered minnows in the World Cup, perform so well. They made it to the Super Eight, thanks to their determination to put up a fight. In the very first match, they inflicted a humiliating defeat on star-studded India. 

 The win gave Bangladesh the boost they needed. It was particularly delightful to watch the 17-year-old stylish opener Tamim Iqbal playing with the maturity of a seasoned batsman. 

 With India out of the tournament, support for Bangladesh has gathered momentum in Calcutta. Personally, I too want newer feathers to be added to the team under the able coaching of Dave Whatmore. Ive my roots in Bangladesh which I left way back in 1956. They may not make it to the semi-final, but whatever they have achieved so far surely bodes well for their future.

 The predicament of the countrys largest library underlines the governments extreme lethargy (Woes aplenty at library, March 14). 

 The number of readers is dwindling day by day and the rest are facing utmost inconvenience. Though the authorities spent tax-payers money for erecting the annexe building Bhasa Bhavan to preserve valuable books and manuscripts, they could not find any solution to protect its property from inundation.

 I was shocked to learn that an HS examinee, Abhirup Dutta, was not enlisted to take the exam as he failed to satisfy the attendance criteria (Court nod for examinee, March 14). I am also an examinee this year from a private school in the city. I had taken some time off to prepare for my exams. My attendance was less than 70 per cent, but my school authorities submitted necessary documents to the Board and I got through easily. 

 Such inconsiderate attitude is shown by many private schools because of lesser number of admissions in the next academic session. It is shameful that Abhirup had to bear so much harassment and needed help from the court to get enlisted.

 Apropos the report Coffee house runs dry (March 10), I was surprised to learn that the civic body snapped water connection to the famous building. Despite the nostalgic passion associated with the address, thanks to the thronging of intellectuals there in the past, the place is fast eroding due to lack of patronage from the present generation.

 One should remember that Coffee House is not

 just a place for drinking coffee but is a cultural monument, connected

 to so many historical figures.

 I have lived outside Bengal for more than five decades. A lover of theatre, I made use of my short stays in the city to watch as many plays as possible. I had the opportunity to witness all the doyens from Sisir Bhaduri and Ahindra Chowdhury to Kamal Mitra, Chhabi Biswas and Utpal Dutt in action. It gave me immense pleasure to know that Paschim Banga Natya Akademi finally has its theatre complex (Permanent hub for theatre society, March 7). It will be a boon for theatre-lovers.

 The photograph of cattle, captioned Crores for Slaughterhouse (March 8), was heart-rending. While cattle are slaughtered, no one addresses the high price of milk. And milk remains unavailable to most infants and patients. The CMC and the state government should use the services of veterinary surgeons to check the health of cattle, and adopt measures so that our animal wealth is not exhausted prematurely.

 Apropos Red ravage on the greens (March 12) , it is painful that the Maidan, a spectacular patch of vibrant green, has once again been damaged by political rallies. It is time we, as sensible citizens from all walks of life, step forward to put an end to these unscrupulous activities and further spoiling of the greenery. If a permanent venue for the Book Fair is possible to preserve the Maidan, a permanent venue for rallies should also be thought of.

 The article Summer time, sabbatical time (April 12) contains inaccuracies. First, I am attending the eight-weeks Advanced Management Program (AMP) which is very, very different from the OMP programme. 

 Second, I am not coming back to India to join PwC in any advisory capacity. I remain a full equity partner of PwC.

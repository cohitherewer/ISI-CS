The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Darjing

 Blue hills and green forests surround Darjing, 47 km north-west of Rourkela. But the tribal settlement itself is rocky and barren. Mostly Santhals and Mundas live here. 

 National Highway (NH) 23 touches Darjing. The river Brahmni also flows past the settlement to disappear into the forest of sal, segun, mahua, kendu, palash and akashmoni.

 On the bank, theres a wonderful bungalow of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). From its balcony, you can hear the wind rustling the leaves in the forest. Spring is pleasant with palash and simul in bloom.

 Norwesters are common during spring. The rain and storm reduce the temperature to around 15 degree Celsius in the evening. 

 There are wild animals in the forest. Elephants are common. There are also bears, wolves, jackals, wild cats and boars. There are several types of birds, including the migratory ones that fly over in winter.

 The lovely sunset ushers in the tranquil night. During festivals, the tribal villages reverberate with the sound of the madal in the evening. 

 Going 

 There are several trains to Rourkela from Howrah. Take a bus to Darjing from there

 Staying 

 The NHAI bungalow can be booked at the NH23 executive engineer rsquo;s office in Rourkela

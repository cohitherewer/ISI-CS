The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Traffic-stoppers amp; road risks

 tt for city 

 The chief minister couldnt be bothered.

 The transport minister pleads helplessness.

 The police wont lift a finger.

 lThe motor vehicles department is busy passing the buck.

 The bus union is brazen.

 But what about you? Take this test to find out how you are adding to the chaos at the crossroads and making the city streets more unsafe and uncivilised.

 I Ride a Two-Wheeler

 I never wear a helmet.

 I wear a helmet but the pillion rider does not.

 I drive with a child standing in front without a helmet.

 I frequently take two/three people on my two-wheeler.

 I dont care about traffic lights or zebra crossings.

 If you tick 0 out of 5, you are a role model. If you tick 4 out of 5, you should get off that two-wheeler at once 

 I Drive a Car

 I paid a driving school/bribed a tout to get a licence without a test.

 I never fasten the seat belt while driving. I never tell the person sitting beside me to fasten the seat belt.

 I change lanes without signalling and overtake from the left.

 I take calls on my cellphone while driving.

 I dont wait for the lights to turn green if there is no cop in sight.

 If you tick 0 out of 5, you are a role model. If you tick 4 out of 5, you should surrender your licence at once

 I am a Pedestrian

 I never use the overpass/underpass to cross the road.

 I never use the zebra crossing.

 I walk on the road even when there is a pavement.

 I wave at approaching vehicles to stop and then cross.

 I just run to cross the road; its up to the cars to stop.

 If you tick 0 out of 5, you are a role model. If you tick 4 out of 5, you should stay indoors

 l am a Bus Passenger

 When the bus is racing. I encourage the driver to go faster.

 When the bus is racing, I sit back and enjoy the ride.

 I do not protest if the bus forces people to hop off without stopping. Sometimes, I even hop off the moving bus when I am in a hurry.

 I do not protest when the bus hits someone/something.

 I flag down a bus even if it is not a bus stop.

 If you tick 0 out of 5, you are a role model. If you tick 3 out of 5, you have blood on your hands

 I am a Bus Driver

 I always race other buses on the same route.

 I do not stop at designated bus stops and pick up passengers from the middle of the road.

 I barely slow down to drop off passengers.

 I never take the bus bay.

 I flee the accident site. I seek union support to cover-my tracks after a mishap.

 If you tick 0 out of 5, you are a role model. If you tick 3 out of 5, you should be arrested and never allowed to drive

 I am a Traffic Cop

 I am often absent from the intersection assigned to me. 

 I turn a blind eye to racing buses.

 I do not respond to a complaint against rash driving.

 Instead of hauling up errant drivers, I make a settlement.

 I do not help an accident victim as its not part of my job.

 If you tick 0 out of 5, you are a good cop. If you tick even 2 out of 5, you should resign

 Five chief ministers, senior Union cabinet ministers, a clutch of CEOs, policy makers and bureaucrats will troop down to Calcutta in September to brainstorm on Managing New India. 

 The three-day mega meet is organised as part of the 34th national management convention of the All India Management Association, which has joined hands with the Asian Association of Management Organisation (AAMO), for the programme, between September 6 and 8. 

 The convention will have five arms. The theme of the convention, Managing New India, will be taken up at the chief ministers conclave, said Ramesh Rajan, the chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), while rolling out the detailed programme schedule. 

 Chief ministers of West Bengal, Orissa, Assam, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are expected to attend the national convention, which has been organised in Calcutta this year to mark the golden jubilee celebrations of Calcutta Management Association. 

 From discussions on how to make India an economic superpower to strategy sessions on optimum utilisation of people the three-day meet will focus on an entire gamut of issues linked to the future of India Inc. 

 Sanjiv Goenka, the vice chairman of RPG Enterprises, and B. Muthuraman, the managing director of Tata Steel, will steer the convention as chairman and co-chairman, respectively. 

 According to Goenka, such an event will have a positive impact on brand Bengal as it will give the state the much needed visibility. 

 Echoing his views, Subir Raha, the president of AIMA, said: Time is right for such a convention in Calcutta, where management education first began in the country. 

 The list of speakers at the conclave will include Baba Kalyani, the chairman and managing director of Bharat Forge, Y.C. Deveshwar, the chairman of ITC, J.J. Irani, the president of AAMO and the director of Tata Sons and MP Jyotiraje Scindia. 

 Besides providing a platform to discuss some of the key issues facing India Inc, the meet will also give budding managers an opportunity to hone their managerial skills through simulated management games. 

 The convention will be preceded by Asian Management Games, to be held in the city from September 3 to 5. Eight teams from countries like Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macaw and India will participate in the competition.

 Easy target: A view of Sudder Street 

 Apropos the report Kids in crime for a fast life, July 13, police officers always have explanations to offer for children taking to crime. A criminal bent is the latest one. 

 The government makes no serious effort to educate slum children. No survey is ever conducted to find out the number of drop-outs among children from underprivileged backgrounds, but the police expect these children to stay out of crime. 

 A section of the kids seeks easy money and modern comforts but do not have the means to get them. Erosion of values and lack of morality in every aspect of life have paved the path to crime for these children. 

 The breakdown of social order is a matter of serious concern. Proper education for all underprivileged children is the only way to keep them away from crime.

 Apropos Molested and harassed, July 12, it is deplorable that foreign tourists are being targeted by criminals. Our guests from abroad have been molested and raped in the Capital. Now, it is the turn of Calcutta to show its ugly face. 

 The inaction of police is inexplicable. The force was once known to be as sharp as Scotland Yard. These days, the police show the door to victims of crime. They have to approach the police with representatives of either a political party or an NGO to register a complaint. Sudder Street is the hub of foreign tourists in central Calcutta. Why cant the police maintain vigil there?

 While the government is trying to woo foreign tourists to the state, criminals are sure to scare them away. Senior police officers need to look into the incident at Sudder Street. The reluctance of police officers to lodge complaints is cause for grave concern.

 The British couples experience in Chowringhee has exposed the fragile law and order situation. It also proves that the area around Indian Museum remains a danger zone. It has always been so but nothing has been done to improve the security there. Instead, police are often hand-in-glove with criminals in the area. 

 K. Bera, 

 Garia 

 The attack on a British couple by drunk motorcyclists must be condemned. Though it was clear that local goons were at work, the police officers made the two go round and round. The police should at least help foreigners. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road 

 It is unfortunate that a young British woman was molested and her husband beaten up in the tourist district. That the police harassed them is shocking. If the guilty are not caught, the couple will return home with the idea that Calcutta is a happy hunting ground for criminals.

 Apropos the report Dilemma over dogs, July 13, it is foolish on the part of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the NGOs to quarrel over the number of dogs in the city and stop their sterilisation. The point is to save people from being bitten by street dogs. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

Apropos the report Curb-hotels cry to save Memorial, July 14, its a laudable initiative by the National Environment Engineering Research Institute to seek curbs on setting up of hotels and restaurants on Park Street and adjoining areas to protect Victoria Memorial from air pollution. It also makes sense to create a green buffer zone by planting trees around the Memorial to protect it from dust and pollution. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 BandBox was founded in 1953, and not 1950, as mentioned in A clean slate, August 8. The founders were late MR Malhotra and late AN John. M.L. Bahri joined as a manager in 1954 and was later inducted into the management. The Malhotras have eight fully-owned units plus 18 independent franchisees at present. 

 Samit Malhotra,

 Sarat Bose Road

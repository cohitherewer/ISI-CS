The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Second hostage found

 A STAFF REPORTER

 One of the two pimps abducted from central Calcutta on Tuesday night was spotted by police walking on BT Road, near Chiriamore, on Thursday afternoon.

 Mohammad Imtiaz, alias Bhaiya, was immediately taken in custody and will be produced in court on Friday.

 Rishi Srivastav, the other abducted pimp, returned to his Bowbazar residence on Wednesday evening. He was produced in court on Thursday. The kidnappers are yet to be traced.

 The police said the abductors allowed the duo to leave after they were paid cash and jewellery worth Rs 2 lakh. We think the duo owed the amount to the abductors, who, too, are pimps, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Imtiaz, a Ballygunge resident, and Rishi had hired a Tata Sumo on Tuesday night and picked up four girls in central Calcutta. Four other pimps joined them near Indian Museum. 

 While the group was travelling around aimlessly in the car, an altercation broke out between Imtiaz and Rishi and the other four pimps.

 When they reached Madan Street, one of the four youths took out a revolver and forced the driver to move towards Creek Row.

 A Qualis was waiting on Creek Row. Once the group reached there, the four dragged out Imtiaz and Rishi and whisked them away in the Qualis, said an officer working on the case.

 The duo told the police that they had been blindfolded in the car. We had no idea where we were headed for. We were finally taken to a dilapidated house, where we were kept confined, they said.

 The sleuths, who were keeping a watch on Chiriamore following a tip-off, said Imtiazs aides had handed over the cash and jewellery to the abductors.

 Deputy commissioner Kumar, however, said the entire incident was not clear to the investigators. There were several inconsistencies in the statements of Rishi and Imtiaz. We are examining their role in flesh trade. There are a number of factors that we need to clarify, he said.

 Expressions of courage and torment

 Rediscovering and re-establishing links between the past and present gain a new, poignant significance in The Times: Then and Now (Samay Takhan, Samay Ekhan), the ongoing exhibition of photographs on the historic Tebhaga movement and the recent human disaster and carnage in Nandigram. Depicting the grim brutality of the state on the one hand and the indomitable spirit of the peasants on the other, the Tebhaga photographs (one among them appears right), taken on-the-spot by late Ananda Pal, one of the first staff photographers of Swadhinata, the organ of the undivided CPI, are a major attraction of the exhibition. The courageous faces and defiant attitudes of the peasants (many among them women) of Basirhat, Kakdwip, Jalpaiguri and Narail (Jessore) come alive through Pals stark, eloquent photographs. On the wall opposite, hang the cruel, grim and silent images of Nandigram a corpse being carried away like a beast on a bamboo contraption, bruised, blackened and traumatised barely-human faces, or a little girl staring vacantly with large, doleful and tearless eyes.

 Event: An exhibition of photographs on the Tebhaga movement and the recent Nandigram debacle When: Till June 20; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Boi-Chitra, top floor, College Street Coffee House

 Incessant rain through the night may have brought life in the city to a standstill on Tuesday, but it was business as usual at Sector V. There was waterlogging at the IT hub, too, but alert civic staff pumped out the water so that the 24x7 industry was not affected. 

 There was very little waterlogging at Sector V in the morning. We have been clearing the drains for the past year and the results are evident. In the morning, there was waterlogging near Infinity because of some repair work. Twenty pumps were activated to clear the water. There were no traffic disruption in Sector V. The IT and the ITES companies registered almost 100 per cent attendance, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which provides civic services in Sector V. 

 Most techies walked into office a little late. However, that was due to continuous rain rather than waterlogging. 

 The attendance in our office was almost 90 per cent. There was waterlogging in Sector V in the morning, but the water was gone by noon, said Rupali Ghosh, who works in TCS.

 At 2pm, the streets were swarming with techies out for their lunch. None of the vendors are absent. Its unbelievable that Sector V is not under knee-deep water after so much rain, said Rahul, who works for BNKe Solutions. 

 Nabadiganta received a thumbs-up from the tech company staff. The authorities have done a decent job. The way Calcutta was under water in the morning, I was afraid that Sector V, too, would be waterlogged, said an official of Wipro.

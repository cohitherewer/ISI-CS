The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Catch the cricket stars 

Fine time for fringe stars

 - The Telegraph Twenty20 with Team India players

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh

 Will Yuvis knee survive a step-out drive or a sliding stop? Can Viru blast one over the point fence with his trademark nonchalance? Can Kaif electrify the crowd with a direct hit?

 Catch a clutch of Team India stars present imperfect, past perfect continuous, past perfect, future tense... right here, right now.

 The Telegraph Twenty20 cricket tournament, presented by the UB Group at CC amp;FC from January 18 to 21, will boast a strong field of India internationals and first-class players battling it out for top honours in the countrys only competitive tournament in this slam-bang format.

 The six teams in the four-day fray are Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), Chemplast from Chennai, ONGC, Indian Airlines, local outfit Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and Sri Lanka Masters from the island nation.

 While all the teams are packed with big names, Yuvraj Singh of Indian Airlines and Virender Sehwag of ONGC will surely be the biggest draws, says Deepankar Nandi, CEO of CC amp;FC.

 Yuvraj will also have former Team India colleague Mohammed Kaif on his side, besides Reetinder Singh Sodhi, Vijay Dahiya and Nikhil Chopra, all with India caps.

 Chemplast will have the likes of Dinesh Mongia, S. Badrinath, Hemang Badani and Laxmipathy Balaji in its ranks.

 An interesting battle will unfold when KSCA, last years champion, takes on CAB in a dress rehearsal of the Ranji Trophy semi-final tie at Eden Gardens, featuring the two state sides.

 CAB, which is resting Bengal bowling spearhead Ranadeb Bose, will be skippered by India discard Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who leads a strong squad starring the likes of Sourashish Lahiri, Subhomoy Das and Sourav Sarkar.

 CC amp;FC, all of 214 years old, had introduced the Twenty20 format to the country through a competitive meet last year, during Utpal Gangulys tenure as president.

 When we started, even though the format was a huge success in England, Australia and South Africa, the BCCI was trying to swim against the tide, Ganguly recalls.

 CAB did see merit in the meet and sent an outfit, while the outstation teams went back and spread the good word around. The second edition of the CC amp;FC tourney also provides great opportunity to fringe players to shine.

 We are committed to the format long-term and are planning to go international in a big way next year, adds Noomi Mehta, present president of the Ballygunge club.

 This is a big year for Twenty20 cricket, with BCCI rolling out the format in April and the World Championships coming off in South Africa in September.

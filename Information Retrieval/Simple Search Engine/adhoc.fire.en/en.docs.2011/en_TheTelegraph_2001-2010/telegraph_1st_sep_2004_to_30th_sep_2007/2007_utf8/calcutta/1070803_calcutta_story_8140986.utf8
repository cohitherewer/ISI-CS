 A 30-year-old homemaker was found dead at her Salt Lake residence on Thursday morning, and police suspected suicide following mental torture by her conservative in-laws.

 Sunita Deys mother, however, alleged that her daughter had been murdered by her in-laws, who could never accept her wearing sleeveless blouses or any other clothes that they thought did not conform to tradition.

 Four members of the in-laws family husband Sandip, father-in-law Dhananjay, mother-in-law Manju and sister-in-law Aparna have been arrested and remanded in judicial custody. They have been charged with causing harm in violation of the private defence and torture.

 It seems to be a case of suicide, though we are exploring all other angles, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police (north 24-Parganas).

 Sandip has been allowed to keep his one-and-a-half-year-old son Siddhartha with him in jail, as Sunitas mother, a widow, or other members of her family refused to take his custody.

 All my savings had been spent on marrying off my four daughters. I cannot take the responsibility of my grandson, said Sunitas mother Krishna.

 Alleging that her daughter had been murdered, Krishna said: When I went to her HA block house with one of my sons-in-law, we found her lying on the floor with blood oozing from her mouth. There were black spots on her hands and other parts of the body, suggesting that she had been beaten up with a heavy object.

 Krishna alleged that her daughter was often subjected to mental torture, as she refused to follow her in-laws conservative way of life. They would never let her wear a sleeveless blouse or any other so-called modern dress.

 Sumita, a sister of Sunita, said: No one saw her hanging. Besides, the noose with which she was said to have hanged herself was not properly tied. We would also like to know what had led Sandip to bring down the body before the police arrived.

 Around 5am, Sandip called the residence of Nabanita, another sister of Sunita, and informed her husband that his wife had died. I immediately conveyed the news to my mother. Soon, she and my husband left for Sandips house, said Nabanita.

 The police came to know during investigation that Sandip, who owns a sweet shop off College Street, and his parents were conservative in their outlook. They had tried to impose a dress code on Sunita and also asked her not to step out of their house. Sunitas sisters even fought with Sandip on the issue, said an officer working on the case.

 Sandips septuagenarian father, Dhananjay, denied the allegation that Sunita had been murdered or that his family had instigated her to commit suicide. He, however, admitted that his son had committed a mistake by bringing down the body on his own.

 We came to know about the death around 5am, when my son woke up and saw Sunita hanging from the ceiling, said Dhananjay.

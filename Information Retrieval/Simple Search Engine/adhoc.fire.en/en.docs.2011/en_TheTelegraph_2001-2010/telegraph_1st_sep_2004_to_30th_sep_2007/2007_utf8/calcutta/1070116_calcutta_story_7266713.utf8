 Schoolteacher Indrani Gangopadhyay, three of whose fingers were almost chopped off by dacoits as she warded them off in her Garia flat on Saturday night, is on the road to recovery.

 Doctors treating the 32-year-old at SSKM Hospital said on Monday that her fingers will not have to be amputated. A surgery was carried out on the fingers. She may require a reconstructive operation, stated surgeon S.S. Chatterjee. 

 The four dacoits had broken into the flat, off Garia Station Road, and entered the room where Indranis mother Sati Chattopadhyay was sleeping. They beat up Indranis husband Atanu when he refused to hand over the keys to an almirah in the room.

 When Indrani, who teaches in a secondary school at Dakshin Barasat, tried to protect Atanu, one of the gang members slashed at her hands with a chopper. The four men fled after neighbours were alerted by her cries for help.

 Criminal Investigating Department (CID) officers said a dispute over keeping caretaker Debdas Kharati in the building could have triggered off the attack. 

 He quit and left for Nabadwip four days ago. Before leaving, he had advised the Gangopadhyays, who were in favour of retaining his services, to be careful. Once Kharati is traced, several questions will be answered, said a CID officer.

 A handful of dignity

 Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been, said Mark Twain. But is it really so? What is it that you might miss the most when you grow old? It might be the morning tennis or a swim in the pool...it might be your daily jog or a wrestle with your German Shepherd....God forbid, it just might be your dignity. As gerontologists around the world struggle to make life less painful for the aged, many old people carry the heavy burden, that is life, fraught with pain, neglect and diseases, on their frail shoulders, hoping and dreaming for a dignified existence in this civilised world. They hanker for death to put an end to their miseries, but even death eludes them. They are our very own parents and grandparents who gave up their youth and happiness for us and, yet, how easily we deny them their rightful place in society and their right to lead a life of dignity. Debarshi Roy has witnessed these elderly men and women from a very close quarter and felt a deep pain and anguish within. He uses vector graphics (also called geometric modelling or object-oriented graphics) perfectly to reproduce their efforts to grasp life like a handful of sand as it slips through their infirm fists. A Handful of Dignity showcases his collection of digital vector artwork in an exhibition which begins this evening at 6. Part of the proceeds will go to Dignity Foundation. 

 lEvent: Digital art by Debarshi Roy lWhen: Till June 6; 10.30 am - 7 pm lWhere: Oxford Bookstore

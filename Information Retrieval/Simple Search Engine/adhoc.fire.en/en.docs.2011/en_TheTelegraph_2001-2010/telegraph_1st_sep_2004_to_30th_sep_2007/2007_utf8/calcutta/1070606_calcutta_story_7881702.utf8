The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Upgrade of traffic system 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta police have invited six companies to make presentations on upgrading the traffic monitoring system.

 Starting Wednesday, the companies will demonstrate their technical skills for introducing a vehicle tracking module based on the Geographical Information System and the Area Traffic Control (ATC) system.

 The vehicle tracking system will use satellite images to draw a detailed map of the city that will indicate the volume of traffic on each road at a given time.

 The ATC, on the other hand, will coordinate traffic signals based on the computerised reading of the volume of traffic.

 Calcutta police had floated an expression of interest for introduction of the Integrated Traffic Policing System. Twenty companies had responded, of which six were shortlisted by a committee comprising experts from National Informatics Centre, Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University, said Kuldiep Singh, special additional commissioner. 

 According to the scheme, vehicles will be fitted with transponders that will emit signals so that when someone in distress seeks help, the nearest police vehicle can rush to him. This will cut down on the reaction time of the police.

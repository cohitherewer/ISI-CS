 Personal compositions

 Coincidentally united by their common location and gender identity, eight women artists from Santiniketan showcase their works in the ongoing exhibition, Intimate Thoughts ... Pristine Fables. All participants operate on distinctly individual ideological and thematic preferences, presenting unique thoughts and perspectives in accordance with their personal experience. Incorporating embroidery in her works, Rima Kundu consciously uses it as a new artistic medium rather than as a conventional feminine activity. Shrabani Roy combines her painted figures on transparent PVC sheets with forms woven in raw silk fibres executed with rare painterly vision. The paintings of Mini Sivakumar (Lady of the Rings; picture right) reveal an entirely intuitive, spontaneous creative process, portraying naive, yet lyrical forms, in bright, gorgeous, decorative style. Pampa Panwar works with premeditated precision, the repetition of forms on her painted canvas being her characteristic mode of expression. Also featuring paintings by Manjari Chakraborty, Chandana Hore, Mahjabin Majumdar and Chandrima Bhattacharyya.

 Event: Paintings by artists from Santiniketan When: Till June 24; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Akar Prakar, P 238 Hindustan Park

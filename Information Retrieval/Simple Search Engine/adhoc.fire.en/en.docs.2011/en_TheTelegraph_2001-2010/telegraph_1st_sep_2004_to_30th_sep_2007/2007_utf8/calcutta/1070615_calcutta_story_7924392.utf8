The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Capital nod for third runway

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Delhi has given the nod for the third runway at Calcutta airport. This was announced by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at a Cabinet core committee meeting on Thursday.

 The need for the third runway is already being felt, but it will soon become an absolute necessity, said S.P.S. Bakshi, regional director (east) of the National Airport Division.

 Even now, flights stay in queue while taking off and have to be put on hold in air while landing during peak hours. In another few years, the airport will be completely clogged, added Bakshi.

 Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport has been struggling to cope with the sudden rise in flight count with just two runways.

 In the past two years, there has been a 45 per cent increase in the number of flights. 

 To make matters worse, only the primary runway has the instrumental landing system (ILS) facility and so, can be used at night and during conditions of low visibility.

 The secondary runway is also shorter and cannot be used for the landing of larger aircraft. It is being extended by 440 metres to take more load.

 The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had earlier submitted a proposal to the state government, seeking 2,000 acres of non-cultivable land in the Narayanpur area. 

 Along with the third runway, a maintenance hub can be built there, said Bakshi.

 According to the proposal, two terminal buildings could be built on the plot and linked with the main airport through a corridor. 

 There is no time-frame in place, as the 2,000 acres are yet to be identified and then acquired.

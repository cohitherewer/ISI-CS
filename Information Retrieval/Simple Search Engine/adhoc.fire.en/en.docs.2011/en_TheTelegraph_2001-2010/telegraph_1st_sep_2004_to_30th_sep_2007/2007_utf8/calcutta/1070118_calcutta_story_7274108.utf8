A caring cop came to the rescue of a critically-injured medical representative on Tuesday and saved his life.

 Thanks to timely intervention by Nirmal Kanti Saha, a sub-inspector of the special cell in the detective department, Ashok Shaw is now undergoing treatment at NRS Medical College and Hospital. 

 Shaw was returning to his Kanchrapara home by local train on Tuesday evening. As the train was entering Dum Dum station around 8.45 pm, Shaw, who was precariously hanging on, fell off.

 I spotted people circling around a body while my train was entering Dum Dum station I got off and rushed to the spot, where this man was lying unconscious in a pool of blood, recounted Saha.

 When the sub-inspector sought help from the bystanders to provide medical attention to Shaw, they asked him to wait till the Government Railway Police (GRP) arrived.

 The man was lying there for over 30 minutes, but no one was ready to help me take him to the station, said Saha, who finally went and requested the GRP officials to take prompt action. He also urged the station master to intervene.

 But, as his pleas fell on deaf ears, Saha decided not to wait any further and risk the life of Shaw. He collected a memo from the station masters office necessary for hospital admission and with the help of some youths, brought Shaw to the station.

 We took a train to Sealdah and reached there around 10.15 pm. I contacted the GRP office and requested them to arrange for an ambulance to shift Shaw to NRS Medical College and Hospital. But they did not respond, added Saha.

 The police officer then hired a rickshaw-van and took Shaw to the emergency ward of the hospital. The doctors advised immediate operation, but first asked Saha to deposit Rs 600 for a CT Scan to ascertain the gravity of the injury. Then, Saha stayed put outside the operating theatre.

 Shaw had sustained serious injuries on his head and chest. He was brought here in time, otherwise it would have been too late, said a doctor. 

 The young medical representative is still critical, but on Wednesday, he had his family by his side. I informed his family members from his cellphone, said Saha, who waited till they arrived.

 The good cop has even lodged a complaint about GRP apathy. We have ordered an inquiry, said Barun Mullick, superintendent of railway police, Sealdah.

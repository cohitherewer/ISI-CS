 Reign of terror

 As part of its ongoing initiative to promote the citys cultural heritage, Hutchison Telecom East Ltd is presently hosting Odeon 2007, the seventh staging of a festival of quality plays. Featuring this evening is the premier performance of Bishesh Bishesh Khobor, a topical play dealing with the theme of global terrorism. In it, a newscaster loses his sanity upon repeatedly narrating horrifying incidents of terror, violence and crime that are taking place each day in every corner of the world. The protagonist of the play realises that education has failed to save the people of the world from terrorism and fascism. Leaving behind his own family, he himself takes up the responsibility of investigating the case of his friends daughter, who has been kidnapped. Direction: Debashish Sarkar.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Bishesh Bishesh Khobor, produced by Unity Malancha When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Madhusudan Mancha

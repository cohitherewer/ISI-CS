 Trafficking arrest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Feroz Khan, 30, was arrested on charges of trying to sell off his 13-year-old sister-in-law to a brothel owner in the port area on Tuesday afternoon. The girl has been rescued.

 Police said Feroz had gone to his in-laws house in Cossipore in the morning. He asked sister-in-law Sultana (name changed) to get ready as he would take her to Victoria Memorial and Alipore zoo. An unsuspecting Sultana agreed to accompany Feroz.

 We got a tip-off from a pimp in the area and raided the brothel. Feroz was sitting in a room with the brothel-owner where our men raided the place, said an officer of Watgunge police station.

 A probe revealed that Feroz and Sultana boarded a bus at Cossipore and came to Esplanade where they had lunch. Around 3pm, he hired a taxi and took Sultana to a red-light area in Munshigung.

 He knew a pimp and went to his house. After half-an-hour, the duo went to a brothel asking Sultana to wait there. A deal was struck with a brothel-owner, who agreed to pay Rs 20,000, the officer added.

 The duo returned after 20 minutes to take Sultana along. When we went there, the girl was locked in a room and Feroz and the brothel-owner were finalising the deal in another room. The owner managed to flee, the officer added.

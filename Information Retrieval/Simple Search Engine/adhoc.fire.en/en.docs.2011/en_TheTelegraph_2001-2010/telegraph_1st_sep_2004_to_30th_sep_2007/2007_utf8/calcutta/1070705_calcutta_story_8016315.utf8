 The first-ever career lounge in the city a hang-out, counselling centre and training institute rolled into one will open in Chowringhee on Thursday.

 Students are not always comfortable talking to counsellors in a formal atmosphere. Often, a chilled-out atmosphere helps them relax. So we thought of opening the lounge, said Ayan Chatterjee, CEO, FutureSoft Management, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems training institute. 

 The lounge, which has flat-screen televisions, coffee-vending machines and gadgets popular with the young, will cater to the career needs of GeNext engineers and professionals who just started out, said Chatterjee.

 A mini gym and a Playstation gaming console have been installed so that students can de-stress after long hours of training, he said. We will train students with industry experience to take on functional consultant jobs, where they have to understand a business process and configure software according to the needs of the client.

 Students will also be trained on various ERP modules, like sales and distribution, production planning, financial accounting and controlling, human resource, materials management and customer relations management, said Chatterjee.

 The Career Lounge will provide training on technical modules like BASIS and ABAP, where the students will have to look into the installation and programming of the ERP software, he said.

 We will provide placement opportunities to our students, he added. 

 Classes start in July-end for a batch of 15 students. The course will be three-and-a-half months long followed by another month of project work. The functional course will cost Rs 50,000 and the technical course Rs 40,000.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Timeout

 Yesterday once more

 Radio has traditionally been a favourite companion to Calcuttas music-crazy audience. A city which has grown phenomenally even after its tercentenary, still boasts of avid listeners of the radio who have grown up on a steady diet of hit programmes like Razzle Dazzle, Nightflight and Binaca Sangeetmala. Radio Ga Ga, an event that will take music-lovers on a trip down memory lane, presents two generations of performing artistes Gopa Ghosh and Jojo. Ghosh, a popular host of Western music programmes, will perform international radio chartbusters of the last eight decades. Her repertoire includes songs by Mitzy Gaynor, Bing Crossby, Diana Ross and ABBA (picture right). Jojo will belt out evergreen chart-toppers rendered by Geeta Dutt, Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar and others. Concept and direction: Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee.

 lEvent: Music performances that relive the magic of radio of yesteryears lWhen: Today at 6.30 pm lWhere: Oxford Bookstore, Park Street

 An inexplicable relationship

 Cine Club, in collaboration with Nandan Cinema, presents the screening of French film Son Frere (a scene from the film appears below), directed by Patrice Chereau. Director of the controversial film, Intimacy, Chereau returns with yet another powerful narrative depicting human relationships. Portraying the complex nature of relationships under strange and adverse circumstances, it unfolds the story of Thomas (played by Bruno Todeschini), who has been estranged from his brother Luc (played by Eric Caravaca) for several years, partly owing to Thomas difficulty in dealing with Lucs sexual preferences. When Thomas is diagnosed with a rare blood disease, which is difficult to treat and impossible to cure, he decides that he wants to bring Luc back into his life. The brothers soon become inseparable, with Luc constantly at Thomas side. Thomas vainly struggles against his disease on one hand, confronting the indignity of treatment on the other. As Thomas and Luc become closer, their new relationship begins to alienate their significant others, who cannot understand or justify the nature of their mutual feelings. Moreover, Thomas father (played by Fred Ulysse) cannot comprehend as to why his son does not fight against his illness with greater vehemence. Hosted by The French Association.

 Event: Screening of French film, Son Frere When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Nandan III

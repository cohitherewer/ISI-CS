 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation on Tuesday started demolishing the two floors that were being added illegally to a building at 5F Palm Avenue, barely 500 m from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees residence.

 I had issued a demolition order in February after finding the construction illegal. Our officials, along with policemen, began the demolition today, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Metro had published a report on January 31 revealing the illegal construction and also an attempt by the promoter, Amir Khan, to connect the building with an adjacent one, at 5G Palm Avenue, violating civic rules.

 Khan was arrested the next day at his Narkeldanga house. The civic authorities subsequently issued a stop-work notice, asking landlord Manik Majumdar to pull down the illegal portion in a month. Majumdar, however, failed to execute the order.

 On the contrary, the promoter and the landlord carried on with the construction at night, after covering the illegal portion with a polythene sheet, said a civic official.

 It will take us another couple of days to demolish the illegal floors. We will also raze the part connecting the adjacent buildings, the mayor added.

 A probe had revealed that the landlord had engaged Khan to construct the two additional floors in November. The local Karaya police station had turned a blind eye to it, despite repeated complaints from local residents.

 According to civic records, around half the 600,000-odd buildings in the city are illegal. Tangra, Topsia, Tiljala, Garden Reach, Palm Avenue and Kidderpore are among the areas that have a high concentration of such buildings. 

 The demolition drive will be undertaken wherever there are illegal buildings. Stern action will be taken against those involved, the mayor asserted.

 In the backdrop of the recent unrest surrounding the age-old debate of the merit of agrarian societies and industrialisation in West Bengal, St. Xaviers College (Calcutta) Alumni Association put up an apt motion for the XVIII Fr. Joris Memorial Nihil Ultra Trophy debate.

 The motion, Rural development is the only answer to West Bengals economic problems was taken up by an eminent list of speakers. The debate has no political connotation, said Father P.C. Matthew, principal of St. Xaviers College.

 Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh, a Xavier alumnus, acted as moderator for the debate, which saw industrialists pitting oratory skills with Xaverians.

 The team of Xaverians speaking for the motion was led by Suman Mukherjee, director, Birla School of Management. Those speaking against the motion were led by Vinod Kothari a financial consultant.

 Speaking for the motion were sports commentator Kishore Bhimani, retired general Shankar Ray Chowdhury, Rahul Roy and Tapan Mitra. Those speaking against the motion included Dipankar Chatterjee, Hemant Kanoria, Atri Bhattacharya and Sanjay Bajoria.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, chief guest for the occasion, addressed the audience laying down his views on the issue. One of the biggest problems facing us today is the way of checking migration from rural areas into Calcutta. To address this, we need to have equal growth in the cities and villages and not the uneven growth there at present. We need to have satellite cities and an all-out economic plan for even growth, especially rural development, he felt.

 The industry representatives speaking against the motion were more convincing and took away the trophy.

 Green quizine

 For the group of avid quizzers gathered at ITC Sonar Bangla for the third Green Biz Quiz 2007 on April 21, fielding questions on the environment problems in Happy Feet or the marine species that killed Steve Irwin was a piece of cake. As were questions about the Bhopal gas tragedy, the Chernobyl and Seveso disasters, and the Kyoto protocol. 

 The competition was organised by the Environment Management Centre of Indian Chamber of Commerce in association with the American Center to commemorate Earth Day. Billed as the only corporate quiz on environment management, it saw 21 teams, including CESC, ITC and Ernst amp; Young, participating. Six teams emerged as contenders after a written screening round comprising multiple choice questions. 

 There were six rounds dealing with environmental awareness, industrial disasters, environmental protocols and legislation, and an audio-visual round. There were special questions for the audience too.

 Sailen Sarkar, state environment minister, present to give away the trophies to the winners, remarked: Programmes like the Green Biz Quiz help to spread the message of conservation. As good corporate citizens, industries have the responsibility to minimise the negative impact of their activities. He was echoed by Henry Jardine, the US consul general, who recalled the initiation of Earth Day in the US in 1970 by Senator Gaylord Nelson: Todays quiz highlights the extent to which the corporate world is aware of the problems plaguing the environment. Aman Chopra and Ravi Shankar of Haldia Petrochemicals won the trophy for the Best Green Team while the participants from Sembramky took away the runners-up trophy.

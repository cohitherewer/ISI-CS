 City Lights

 Pondicherry to London book fair

 Beating 51 others, S. Anand, 34, was chosen the Indian Young Publisher of the Year at a city five-star last Sunday. He runs the Pondicherry-based Navayana Publishing that does certain books for as little as Rs 60. 

 Anand (picture above) will now compete for the International Young Publisher of the Year Award at the London Book Fair in April 2007, which carries a cash prize of 7,500, plus a free stall at the London Book Fair 2008. The international award is a collaboration between the British Council and London Book Fair. 

 Anands website says Navayana is publishing for social change. The judges were impressed by his ability to act quickly and effectively on ideas for books gleaned from everyday life in India.

 Silver dust 

 Alex Stenghel is an Italian artist who lives in Paris. He has visited India frequently, often enough to create a body of work inspired by Jain architecture that is being exhibited at Akar Prakar gallery.

 There is an aura of mysticism in the works. Stenghel creates shadowy impressions of phallic symbols, the shapes of leaves and other architectonic designs in the softest of shades, and dusts the space around with silver.

 He also works with scraps of paper pulp in dark shades and colourful shreds of cloth. It is all very exotic and a typical foreigners view of India.

 Telling tales 

 Are you married? Do you have children? asks the diminutive lady. These very questions were asked of her some half-a-century back when she had approached a senior lawyer of the high court to do an articleship with him.

 Go get married, he said. I said, I already have. Then go have a child. I had already had Vikram. Well, then have a second child. I had had Shantum in London, by then. Then join office from tomorrow, he had said gruffly. 

 Leila Seth is a born story-teller. Had she not retired from active practice and broken her ankle, we would have almost missed having On Balance, the autobiography of the first Indian woman chief justice. 

 I enjoy every bit of fame that comes to me as mother of Vikram, says Leila, in town for a personal visit. But does it rankle that perhaps On Balance is read more because of Vikram? Like a deft lawyer, she dodges the question: Its been extremely satisfying to have such wonderful children. I will have it no other way.

 Fine prints

 A work by Haren Das

 Haren Das (1921-1993) was a complete printmaker who could do woodcut, wood engraving, lithograph, drypoint, linocut, etching and aquatint with a finesse unsurpassed even today. Das was a student of Ramendranath Chakravarty. A prolific printmaker, his works have an innocence that continues to surprise us.

 Art critic Sandip Sarkar has written a slim volume on him entitled Haren Das, Printmaker Par Excellence, which will be released at the Academy of Fine Arts on Monday at 5 pm at an exhibition of Dass prints.

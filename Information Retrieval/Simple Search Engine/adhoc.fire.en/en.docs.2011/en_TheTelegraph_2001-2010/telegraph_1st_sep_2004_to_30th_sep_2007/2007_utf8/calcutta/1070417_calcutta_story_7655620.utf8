 This summer, the city chapter of a mountaineering club will make the first Indian civilian attempt to scale one of the most challenging peaks in the Himalayas. 

 Led by retired Air Vice Marshal Apurba Bhattacharya, the 11-member team from Himalayan Club will begin the expedition to Mount Nilkanth on May 18. The mountaineers are expected to return to the city on June 27.

 The team includes three members from the clubs successful expedition to Indias third highest peak, Mount Kamet, last year. Two of the members are from the Indian Navy.

 At 6,596 metres, Mount Nilkanth is among the most technically demanding peaks for climbers. It is couched between the Satopanth and Panpatia glaciers in the Garhwal Himalayas.

 The peak has been scaled only four times since the first attempt by Frank Smythe in 1936. Two army teams climbed it in 1974 and 1993, followed by a Scottish team, led by Martin Moran, in 2000 and the Slovenian team of Marko Prezelz in 2001. Six members of a Japanese team died while trying to scale the peak in 1993.

 Bhattacharyas team will attempt to climb the peak from the west ridge on its southern face. We will also explore the possibility of opening a route from the south east ridge. Smythe failed in his attempt to do that, said Bhattacharya. 

 The budget for the expedition is about Rs 4 lakh. The club will provide 60 per cent of the amount. The rest of the money will come from the members.

 The inclusion of a doctor, who is also a qualified mountaineer, in the team is an advantage for us, stated Bhattacharya. We expect to find exposed snow in the moraine zone of the glacier, which will make it more difficult to negotiate.

 The entire south face is avalanche prone, according to climbing leader Gautam Ghosh. We will have to negotiate ice walls of 70 to 80 degrees gradient. We will use fixed ropes for a large part of the route after base camp, he said.

 Ghosh, who has climbed more than 20 peaks, added: Though we hope to succeed, a safe return is the highest priority.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boost for wireless Net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Wire-free Internet connectivity in the city may receive a boost this week, three months after Pune went completely wireless.

 Representatives of Denmark-based Wireless Innovation Platform (WIP) Labs will call on the information technology (IT) minister to finalise plans of increasing wireless Internet coverage in Calcutta.

 It is certain that the wireless connectivity project will go ahead, said an IT department official.

 The advantage of a wireless network is that it allows anyone with a Wi-fi or WiMAX-enabled laptop, mobile phone or personal digital assistant (PDA) to access Internet on the move. The metros have hotspots, usually places of business interest, hotels and airport lounges, where wireless Internet access is possible.

 WIP Labs will also set up Indias first centre for developing fourth generation (4G) telecommunication products in the city by investing Rs 200 crore. Allocation of a 20-acre plot will be discussed. It was initially decided that the plot would be opposite Vedic Village, 10 km from the airport. But the location has changed. The details of a joint venture company, in which the state government will have a stake, will be worked out, said the official.

 WIP Labs had earlier submitted a plan to the IT department to make the city wirelessly connected at an infrastructure cost of Rs 8-10 crore. The company, a joint venture of Sabita Holdings and Xfon Holdings, is likely to do a pilot project in Sector V and then cover the rest of the city.

 Webel, the nodal IT agency in the state, has provided a document to WIP Labs on the structure of the project.

 Wireless networks are here to stay. There are significant merits in cities taking up wireless connectivity projects, Kiran Karnik of Nasscom had stressed.

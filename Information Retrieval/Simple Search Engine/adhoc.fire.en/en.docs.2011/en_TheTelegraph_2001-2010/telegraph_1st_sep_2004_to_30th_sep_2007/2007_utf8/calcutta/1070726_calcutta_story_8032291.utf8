The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A history of errors

 - INACCURACIES ABOUND IN TEXTBOOKS

 JULIUS GOMES

 The daughter of Nur Jahans brother was married to Jahangirs third son Khusrau (Shah Jahan). The French governor of Pondicherry during the Anglo-French conflict was Lord Dupleix.

 These nuggets of information all wrong have been lifted from history textbooks of students of classes VII and VIII of reputed English-medium schools in Calcutta. And there are several other mistakes.

 Khusrau, in fact, was Jahangirs first son, while the third son was Khurram, who later became Shah Jahan. He married Mumtaz Mahal, Nur Jahans niece. French governor Dupleix was never a lord, though his British rival Robert Clive was. 

 The books dishing out the inaccuracies to young learners are The Trail (Books Two and Three, for classes VII and VIII), published by Oxford University Press (OUP), and Transitions, published by Madhubun.

 These books have been withdrawn in our school after teachers pointed out the errors, but students of some other schools are still studying them, said the principal of a reputed school and a member of an association of heads of schools.

 Mistakes ranging from wrong page numbers to inaccurate facts and dates have become a cause of concern for us, said the mother of a Class VII student.

 What do the publishers have to say? While Vikas Publishing House, the parent company of Madhubun, declined comment, OUP officials said the revised versions of the books do not contain the errors.

 Our editors have gone through the list of errors that you had sent. Quite a few of them have been rectified in subsequent impressions, Tilak Raj Sharma, of OUP, told Metro. We will carefully examine each of the points raised by you and in discussion with our author and experts, make the necessary changes.

 One of the books brought out by OUP says the Lok Sabha has 550 members (the correct figure is 545) and the Rajya Sabha has 250 members (five more than the actual figure).

 Sharma, however, claimed that according to India 2007 (Publications Division), the Lower House of Parliament has 552 members. History, especially dates, is a source of controversy and debate.

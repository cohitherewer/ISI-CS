 At a time when the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) is running in the red, a German expert has done a SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, threat) analysis of the oldest public transport system in the city.

 Martin Schneider of the University of Applied Sciences in Erfurt (Germany) conducted the study, with the help of city-based NGO Environment Governed Integrated Organisation between March and August last year. The report Tramways in Calcutta; A Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threat Analysis, vis--vis the Urban Transport System blames infrastructure problems, inconsistent schedules, lack of integration with other transport systems and poor planning for the condition of the tramways.

 The governments indifference in sustaining the eco-friendly mode of transport and the clout of CTC workers unions have been highlighted in the report as threats to the companys survival. Examples of other cities have been cited in the report to suggest ways to solve the CTCs problems.

 The study, carried out at Wellington Square, Rajabazar, Maidan, Rashbehari crossing and other areas, exposes the weaknesses of the system. Passengers sometimes have to wait 45 minutes for a tram, said Debasish Bhattacharya, who guided the project for the NGO.

 He pointed out that tram services have been discontinued on some stretches and on some others, the vehicle plies along the middle of the road, making it difficult for passengers to board the cars. 

 There are problems with scheduling, infrastructure and stoppages. We plan to take remedial action, said Rajdeo Goala, chairman and managing director of the CTC.

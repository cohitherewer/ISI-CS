 Power of red

 The success of figurative art depends upon the artists creative handling of his distinctive style and technique. A figurative painter in every sense of the term, Samir Sarkar is very much the creator of his own dream world. He creates his figures in his unique surrealistic style, achieving heightened strength and sensuousness through bright, primary colours. One of the most endearing features of his works is that his ideal, mythological figures are placed right in the middle of real-world situations without apology. His Krishna loses nothing of his divine charm or character on wearing the artists signature style cap or bright-coloured attire. Sarkars works amuse, attract and please our aesthetic senses; they invite us to be part of the happy and idyllic dream world conjured by him on his canvases. The Red Palette, the ongoing show of his recent paintings, highlights the artists excellent, effective use of the colour red to impart a surreal energy to his works.

 Shades of South

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A watercolour by Viswanadhan

Six artists from South India have been highlighted in Akar Prakars current exhibition. 

 They have two things in common all the artists, with the exception of one, use hot colours in a way that was common practice about two decades ago. But then all these artists are quite senior. Besides, all these works are non-figurative, never mind the occasional human form. 

 V. Viswanadhan is the best known of the six and his large painting in fiery red and green comes in its usual format that bears a close resemblance to the slats of windows. The glowing colours stand out from the wall. Viswanadhans two small watercolours on paper look beautiful with their rainbow hues. They are brilliant, like light refracting through a prism. 

 K.M. Adimoolam daubs blue, green, red and orange pigment on a backdrop of beige, giving it a distinctly posterish look. The colours look gaudy, without adding much to the painted surface.

 Once again, red, orange and black are the favourite colours of Achuthan Kudallur, but his paintings are more structured. Black and yellow lines form the wings of butterflies decorated with yellow and orange dots. 

 P. Gopinath has painted flowers, faces in profile and twirling lines on his paintings with acrylic on paper. They look highly decorative but retro fashion. 

 Both Akkitham Narayanan and R.M. Palaniappan offer relief from this colourful onslaught. Narayanan uses the tools of geometry and soothing colours to create works that remind us of traditional paintings. Palaniappan uses brown and red conti to draw lines that define pyramids, rectangles and sections of circles within circles. With these ingredients and no more, he creates a sense of harmony. Minimum used to maximum effect.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bomb scare at airport

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Security was boosted across Calcutta and there were three bomb scares at the airport the day after the Hyderabad blasts.

 Plainclothesmen are on the lookout for anything suspicious at vital installations, including malls and multiplexes. The entry and exit points of the city are being monitored, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). Police have appealed to the people to alert them if they see any suspicious item lying around.

 The first bomb scare on Sunday occurred around 11am when the CISF was alerted about a bag lying near the checking counter of the domestic terminal. Security personnel cordoned off the area and sent for the bomb disposal squad.

 While the experts were at work, M. Madini, a passenger on an Indian flight to Aizawl at 11.30am, claimed the bag. She said she had left the bag behind and gone to her car to fetch her ticket. Madini was fined Rs 100.

 The second hoax occurred around 12.45pm, when CISF personnel spotted another unattended bag near the domestic terminal lounge. Again, the area was cordoned off and the bomb disposal squad called in. Samir Deb, who was to fly to Agartala, claimed the bag. He told the officers that he had gone to the washroom. He, too, was fined Rs 100.

 Barely an hour later, another unclaimed bag was seen in the domestic terminal and the security drill repeated. Another Agartala-bound passenger, Prahlad Saha, claimed the bag after paying the fine.

 Burglary in flat at Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sudha Dutta, 75, gets up early every morning and goes down to collect flowers for puja. At 5am on Sunday, she had a chance encounter with one of the men who had just burgled the flat of her ground-floor tenant but claimed he was in charge of it.

 J.K. Bal, a senior officer in Power Development Corporation Limited, had rented the space two years ago. 

 A gang of thieves had broken open the ground floor flat of EC-185 in Salt Lake, where Bal lives, and decamped with cash and jewellery. Police could not ascertain the value of the stolen articles as the family is visiting Bals ailing father-in-law in Cuttack. Widowed Sudha Dutta lives on the first floor.

 She locked herself inside her flat as the young man roused her suspicion. At 6.30am, Tulsi, the domestic help who works in Bals flat and lives with her family close by, was passing by and noticed that the flat was open. The Bals were to return on Sunday evening. When Tulsi entered the flat it was in a chaotic state. She raised an alarm. Bidhannagar (North) police station detained some labourers of the City Centre area for interrogation.

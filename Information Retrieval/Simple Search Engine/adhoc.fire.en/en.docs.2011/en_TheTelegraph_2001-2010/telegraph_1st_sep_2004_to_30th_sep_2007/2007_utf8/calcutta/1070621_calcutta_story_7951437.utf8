 Subhas tirade in Salt Lake tax war

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty took a dig at the judiciary for clamping down on Bidhannagar Municipalitys move to generate taxes at higher rates from Salt Lake residents.

 Chakraborty was addressing a 200-strong convention organised by Laban Hrad Mancha. The judges would have thought differently, had they actually lived in Salt Lake and were aware of the situation, said the minister.

 With all due respect, I can say that a verdict alone cant deliver services to people. Only elected representatives can do that, said Chakraborty.

 The convention sought to address the question of generating funds for the municipality, as it is reeling from a Supreme Court directive that ruled out the collection of taxes at the new rates.

 Only some people in Salt Lake have protested, Chakraborty said.These are people who do not have any work but want to project themselves in the limelight by taking such steps in the name of welfare.

 Most of the members of the civic board addressing the convention, too, were critical of the Bidhannagar Welfare Association (BWA), which moved court against the civic boards assessment of the new tax rates that were effective from June last year.

 They should have been more responsible before taking such steps. Perhaps, these people understand welfare as the means to stop paying taxes at all, said Chakraborty.

 However, the members of BWA, who boycotted the convention, refuted the charges levelled against them.

 We are not against paying taxes and we can pay at higher rates. But the municipality should first clarify the procedure by which they are determining taxes. They have to ensure transparency, said Basab Aich, secretary of the BWA.

 We were initially baffled when we learnt of the apex courts verdict, said Biswajiban Majumder, chairman, Bidhannagar Municipality. Well start collecting service taxes and also taxes from traders whove been avoiding payment.

 Well abide by the rules and try to work out a solution. But we will not deny civic amenities, despite all the crunches were facing, added Majumder.

 The municipality spends around Rs 75 lakh per month from its coffers.

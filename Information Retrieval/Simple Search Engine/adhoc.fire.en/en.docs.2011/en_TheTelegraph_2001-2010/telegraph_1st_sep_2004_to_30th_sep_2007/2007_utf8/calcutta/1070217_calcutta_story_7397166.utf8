 Cheaper executive medicare 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Executive rooms with LCD monitors, mechanised beds, library, lounge for visitors and other state-of-the-art facilities for patients will now be available at a subsidised rate.

 Mission of Mercy Hospital and Research Centre (formerly Assembly of God Church Hospital, on Park Street) has introduced an executive wing where patients can get the amenities of a corporate hospital at a cheaper rate. 

 The unit was inaugurated by film director Goutam Ghose on Wednesday.

 We have introduced the unit to provide good medicare at a cheaper rate and also raise funds for free treatment of underprivileged patients, said Sanjay Prasad, hospital CEO and executive director. 

 The executive unit, built with an investment of Rs 1 crore, has 16 rooms with mechanised beds, library, LCD monitors and other modern state-of-the-art medicare equipment. 

 Patients will have the facility of bedside admission and discharge procedures. Patients kin will not have to run from one department to another for completing the formalities, an official said. 

 The charges for a room in the executive unit are around Rs 3,000 a day, compared with Rs 5,000-Rs 8,000 a day at a corporate hospital. 

 The hospital was co-founded in 1977 by US-based couple Huldah and Mark Buntain, who came to India in 1954 and worked for the uplift of the poor. 

 The hospital provides free treatment to more than 40 per cent of its patients. 

 Efforts are on to revamp the existing wings and introduce more facilities for the poor. 

 Partho Bandyopadhyay, head of the ophthalmology department, said the eyecare wing has been refurbished with an investment of Rs 50 lakh. 

 Imported eye power testing machines, non-contact tonometre (used for testing eye pressure) and automated field analyser (to diagnose nerve damage by glaucoma) have been installed.

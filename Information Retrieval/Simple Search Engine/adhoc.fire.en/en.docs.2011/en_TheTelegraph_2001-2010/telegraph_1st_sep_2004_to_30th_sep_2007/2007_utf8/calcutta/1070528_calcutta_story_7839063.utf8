 Executive in kidnap net

 - Teen nephew taken hostage, family feud behind abduction

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 A deputy sales manager of Coal India has been arrested in Ranchi for allegedly kidnapping his teenaged nephew from Baguiati. A family feud was behind the kidnapping, said police.

 The executive has reportedly confessed to the crime. He was arrested in his Ranchi residence early on Saturday and brought to the city on Sunday.

 Parakh Raj, a Class X student, was abducted near a coaching centre in Baguiati last Thursday evening. He was traced to a hotel in Bagnan, Howrah, within hours, after his father lodged an FIR with Rajarhat police station.

 According to the police, Hitesh Verma, the executive, masterminded the kidnapping of his nephew. The boys mother is the sister of Vermas wife.

 During the raid at the Bagnan hotel, we picked up two of the abductors. They provided us leads about Verma. A joint team of Rajarhat and Bagnan police immediately left for Ranchi, said an investigating officer.

 This is the second time the Coal India executive has been arrested. He was held on October 26, 2004, on charges of killing his wife Sanjana over dowry-related problems, 11 years after their marriage.

 Verma had been suspended and sent to judicial custody at Birsa Munda Central Jail, in Ranchi. Members of Parakhs immediate family deposed against Verma during the trial.

 Verma was released from prison 14 months later, after the police probe confirmed that Sanjana had died of natural causes. Relations between Verma and Parakhs family have been strained since then. 

 Sarojbala, the executives mother, alleged that her son had been falsely implicated. Sanjanas maternal uncle is a Jharkhand minister and is behind all the problems. He is trying to implicate my son in the abduction case, she alleged.

 Superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar said Verma has confessed to abducting Parakh. 

 We interrogated him this morning after he was brought to the city. He has confessed to the crime. It seems he had planned to kill the Class X student to take revenge on his family members. Verma feels he would not have had to go to jail if Parakhs family members had not deposed against him at the trial, said Kumar.

 The police are looking for the remaining members of the gang of abductors. According to our sources, they have fled to Jharkhand. We hope to catch them soon. Verma will be produced in court tomorrow, said an officer investigating the abduction.

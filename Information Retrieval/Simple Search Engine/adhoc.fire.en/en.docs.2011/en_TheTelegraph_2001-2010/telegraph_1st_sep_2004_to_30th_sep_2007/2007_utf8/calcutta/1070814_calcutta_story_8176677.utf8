 A cellphone tower set up two months ago on the roof of Ballys Durgapur Pallimandir Balika Vidyamandir has local residents up in arms. They have launched a signature campaign highlighting the harmful effects that the tower could have on the schoolchildren.

 According to scientists, exposure to strong electromagnetic radiation can lead to memory loss, giddiness, headache and, in extreme cases, tumour or cancer in the brain.

 We have sent letters to the state pollution control board, the district magistrate of Howrah and the authorities at various levels with signatures of more than 300 residents, including the parents of the schoolchildren, said Ganesh Sengupta, the president of Ganatantrik Paribesh Raksha O Gana Unnayan Committee of Bally Durgapur.

 Sushanta Mondal, whose daughter Sushmita studies in Class VI in the school and suffers from a congenital cardiac problem, started the campaign after reading about the harmful effects of electromagnetic radiation in a magazine. 

 The LIC agent said he would transfer his daughter to another school if the tower is not removed soon.

 Somnath Narayan, an environmental engineer with the pollution control board, told Metro that in the absence of a law on cellphone towers, the boards hands were tied. He confirmed receiving letters from various organisations and individuals against the tower.

 The board has asked the service provider to appear before the hearing officer at Paribesh Bhavan on Friday, failing which the authorities will issue the necessary regulatory order and take legal steps. 

 Gana Unnayan Committee has also been asked to attend the hearing.

 The company declined to comment on the matter.

 It is mandatory for cellphone service providers to set up towers at least 150 ft from the ground, said Zafar Haq, the CEO of Cogent, a Delhi-based organisation that conducts radiation audits. In the Bally school, the children on the top floor are hardly 15 feet away from the tower.

 Haq also stated that research has shown that electromagnetic radiation affects children more than adults. 

 The company has donated Rs 75,000 to the local panchayat and has paid the first instalment of the monthly rent of Rs 7,500 to the school for setting up the tower.

 Panchayat pradhan Mitra Mukherjee and headmistress of the school Alpana Majumdar said they were not aware of the harmful effects of electromagnetic radiation. 

 The Rs 75,000 that the company donated to us was kept for the construction of a science lab at Durgapur Pallimangal Boys School. However, if the government directs us to remove the tower, we will obviously do so, said Mukherjee.

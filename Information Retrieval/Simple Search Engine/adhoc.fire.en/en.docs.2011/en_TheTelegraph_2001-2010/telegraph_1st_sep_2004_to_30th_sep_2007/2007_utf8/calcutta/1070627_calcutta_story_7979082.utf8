 Doctor, estranged, found dead at home 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The decomposed body of a 45-year-old doctor of a government hospital was found at his Sinthee residence, beside empty phials of medicine, on Tuesday morning.

 Debajyoti Banerjee, who worked in the medicine department of BN Bose Hospital in Barrackpore, had not been to work since June 21.

 His wife Sikha had moved out with their 12-year-old son Jishu in August last year. They are staying at her parents in the city.

 We tried to contact Banerjee but found his mobile phone switched off. The calls to his landline phone went unanswered, said D.K. Biswas, superintendent of the hospital.

 The doctor had been staying at Vinayak Apartment, in Sinthee, since 2001. His neighbour Amar Pradhan said: We had not seen the doctor for several days. On Tuesday morning, a foul smell was coming out his flat No. 208 in O block.

 The neighbours went to the second-floor flat and peeped through a window. They saw Banerjee lying on the floor. We informed Baranagar police station. The officers broke open the front door around 12.30pm, said another neighbour.

 The cause of the death can be ascertained only after the post-mortem, said North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar.

 It appears the doctor had committed suicide because of family problems, said an investigating officer. The cops are trying to find out if Sikha had started divorce proceedings.

 Banerjees neighbours and colleagues said he had been depressed since his wife left him and hardly interacted with people.

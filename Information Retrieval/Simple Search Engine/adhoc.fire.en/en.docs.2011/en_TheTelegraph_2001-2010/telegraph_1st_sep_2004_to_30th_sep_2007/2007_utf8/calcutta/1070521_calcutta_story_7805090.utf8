 A group of school students, all members of a popular social networking website, has come to the aid of 15 starving inmates of a childrens home in Madhyamgram.

 The residents of Sishumanjil had been starving after the owner cut off food supply following the inmates complaint to the governor about irregularities in the running of the home.

 Metro had carried a report on the plight of the home inmates last Tuesday. The members of the group learnt about the inmates from the report.

 The students study in different schools but a number of them take math tuition at a coaching class in Bhowanipore. They also keep in touch over the Internet.

 After reading about the starving children, we discussed the matter among ourselves at the coaching class. We were trying to find a way to help the kids. We posted our plan on the portal of our community on the website. We also discussed the issue with our teacher, who encouraged us to help the inmates, said Avideep Bhattacharjee, a student of Class IX at St James School.

 As the students sought help for the Sishumanjil residents on their community page on the website, many chipped in. Two of them, sisters Aina and Taniya Bansal of La Martiniere, said: When our friends who go to the math tuition classes asked for help, we decided to do our bit.

 The students asked the mathematics teacher to help them send the aid. The tutor contacted NGO Diganta, which delivered food to the children.

 The mathematics teacher, who lives close to the office of our organisation, approached us. We decided to help the students as they had shown great social responsibility. Abiding by our organisations rules, we asked the students to provide rations for the home inmates, said secretary of the NGO Utpal Roy. The rations reached the inmates on Friday.

 The students prepared a list and collected rice, cereals and other cooking items for the Sishumanjil kids.

 The students sent rice and even cooking oil. The food they sent is enough for at least 15 days, said the warden of the home, Biranjan Das, who is now running it with help from local residents.

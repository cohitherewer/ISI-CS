 SOUMITRA DAS

 A photograph by Yann Toma

 Gjon Mili had once taken a fascinating photograph of Picasso drawing a Minotaur in thin air with light in a darkened room. Picasso drew the mythical beast with a flashlight in the air, and the film recorded the kinetic light. Subsequently, many artists have done the same. The photographs may look hi-tech but it is only a question of exposing the film for the right number of seconds and clicking the shutter at the right moment.

 Yann Toma, whose works are being exhibited at Chitrakoot Gallery, takes similar photographs in colour with the difference that fibres of light intertwine Tomas subjects like an aura or a nimbus. Often, this linear effulgence creates human figures.

 The French photographer needs introduction. According to a website, in 1991, Yann Toma bought the rights to Ouest-Lumire, the fictitious French electric company nationalised under EDF in 1946. Toma has said in an interview: I made them pose with make-up and I moved with my special lights real fast, so that when the pictures are taken Im not seen, but the lights are. Those lights represent the energy and aura of the artistes.

 So, we see these bands of electricity resembling optic fibres creating squiggles in a classroom full of children, around a man in a dimly-lit shop, a model in a dark field just before nightfall, an old woman in a shanty and a young woman, presumably a model, resting in the peace of her home or studio. 

 Mysterious and lonely havelis look even more enchanting when these bands of light dance in front of them, creating skeletons glowing like phosphorus. The light snakes around a group of workers in a power plant. The photograph was taken in the harsh light of sodium vapour lamps and this lux fantastic distances it from immediate reality. 

 The photographs are by themselves not that remarkable, but what sets them apart is the huge size and high quality of the prints. The most remarkable of these photographs is the one of a sance, with two men in front of an Ouija board, and a third revealing himself, leg first. Is Yann trying to pull the viewers leg?

 Two of Mahatma Gandhis direct descendants came together on the eve of a bandh called to protest state violence.

 Sixty years after Gandhi spent the day of Independence fasting and trying to bring about peace in Calcutta, there is still strife, this time not over religion or caste, but over economics, said Tushar Gandhi, whose book Lets Kill Gandhi was launched at Crossword on Thursday evening.

 Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi attended the launch, hours after visiting a Tamluk hospital where some of those injured in the Nandigram firings are battling for life.

 Talking of Nandigram, the author warned: Divisions could turn into fissures that would lead to complete fragmentation.

 Having written a 987-page tome on Gandhis last years, Tushar Gandhi stressed on senseless violence. The title of the book, a little naughty, the author admitted, reflects the deep-rooted conspiracy and the complete official apathy towards Gandhis security.

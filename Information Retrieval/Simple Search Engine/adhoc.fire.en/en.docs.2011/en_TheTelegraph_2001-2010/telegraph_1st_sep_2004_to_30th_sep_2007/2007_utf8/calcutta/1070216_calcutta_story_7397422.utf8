 The sheen of enamels

 - Liberation in drawing

 SOUMITRA DAS

 One of the works by Vasudev on display at Galerie 88

 The most striking aspect of S.G. Vasudevs works, being exhibited at Galerie 88, is the finesse with which he creates matt surfaces on his canvases with oil paint. Some of the canvases are pretty large. From a distance the canvases look like this senior artist from Bangalore has used enamel instead of oil colours. They have that sheen and glow.

 Faces of doe-eyed, Nefertiti-like women in profile form the focus of many of his works both small and large in burning red, green, deep blue and ochre. The women have long swan-like necks and even when they are full frontal, they have the same physical attributes. The colours, indeed, have the glow of enamels. But these paintings look constricted for he repeats the same feminine image over and over again. And this can be bothersome. 

 Even coition looks insipid, though he leaves nothing to the imagination. In his mithuna paintings, the couples never manage to get things heated up. They could as well be corpses. 

 His landscapes, in ochre and cream, look more structured, with their boulders piled upon boulders and trees mushrooming all over. They remind one of forests painted in Persian and Indian miniatures with their masses of colour. 

 Vasudevs pen-and-ink drawings with their fine, wiry lines also depict faces and trees but they are a lot more fanciful than his paintings. Here, Vasudev breaks free of all obstructions and his lines flow lucidly. The faces emerge from hills like huge balloons and roll on wheels. The trees seem to have a life of their own. The patterns on dresses seem to blossom life flowers in bloom. One wishes the painter could have unshackled his imagination in the same manner in his paintings, too.

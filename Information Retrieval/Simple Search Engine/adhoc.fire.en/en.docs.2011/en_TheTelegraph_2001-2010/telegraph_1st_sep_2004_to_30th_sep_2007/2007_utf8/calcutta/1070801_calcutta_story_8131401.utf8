 Complaint withdrawn

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The parents of Tabassum a Class VII student who stood up to an eve-teaser and helped police arrest him have withdrawn the complaint against the accused, Gautam Singh.

 Following the withdrawal of the complaint late on Monday, we had no option but to release Singh, said an officer of Gariahat police station said.

 The parents may have got scared, thinking that the complaint and the subsequent police probe might have earned their daughter a bad name. They said they wanted to forget the incident considering her career, the officer added.

 Tabassum, a student of Cartouche School in Park Circus, was returning home on a bus on route 45 on Monday afternoon when she was allegedly harassed by Singh.

 She raised an alarm and the driver stopped the bus on seeing a traffic sergeant. The accused was caught and handed over to Gariahat police station. The girl, too, went to the police station and recorded her statement.

 Tabassum came to school on Tuesday, accompanied by her father. Other students said the girl was looking upset.

 Tabassum broke down and said the man had been stalking her soon after she got into a bus on route 240. Sensing trouble, she got off the vehicle at Ballygunge Phari and boarded a bus on route 45. But the man followed her to the second bus, too, kept passing lewd remarks at her, said Shabnam Hossain, a teacher of the school.

 The teachers of Cartouche School were upset that Tabassums parents had withdrawn the complaint.

 Her father might have feared that the tormentor would create problems for Tabassum. Since she commutes alone, they didnt want to take any risk, said Archana Dutta, another teacher.

 Shabnam rued that the accused had to be let off. He should have been brought to book. Cases of eve-teasing against are on the rise. Stern action needs to be taken against the perpetrators, she added.

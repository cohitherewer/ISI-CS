 Landlord hand in mystery murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A murder mystery gripped the Regent Park area, on the southern fringes of the city, from Tuesday morning after a body bearing multiple injuries was found near a hydrant.

 By the end of the day, a landlords hand in the murder of his tenant had been revealed.

 There was confusion about the identity of the mutilated body. We have learnt that his name was Madan and he was around 40 years old. But we do not have any more details about his identity, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas. 

 Police zeroed in on 35-year-old Chhotka Das, Madans landlord. We found a bloodstained mat outside Chhotkas residence, some 10 yards away from where the body was found, said Gupta.

 Chhotka broke down during interrogation and admitted that he knew Madan, who had moved into his Sonali Park house as a tenant barely a week ago.

 The accused also revealed that he and Madan were partners in brokering property deals in the area now a realty hotbed.

 Chhotka, Madan and another person were drinking on Monday night. Madan was killed soon after that, said an officer, claiming that the trio had criminal antecedents.

 According to Chhotka, the third person at the drinking table first hit Madan with a heavy object and then slit his throat with a sharp weapon.

 Then, the two wrapped Madans body with a mat, dragged it to the nearby hydrant and dumped it.

 We are looking for the third person to understand the motive behind the murder, added the officer. 

 While police continue their search for the other accused, residents drew attention to the rising crime graph in the area due to the construction boom. 

 We are all shocked with the incident We hope police will finally take some action, said Dinesh Bose, a resident of Sonali Park.

 Insider in theft at ATM 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The defalcation of Rs 5.5 lakh from a State Bank of India (SBI) automated teller machine (ATM) could have been the work of insiders, suspect police.

 The theft was discovered last Tuesday, after users spotted a zero account balance and reported the discrepancy to the banks branch manager in Ghoshpara, Bally.

 This is a sophisticated kind of a theft, where the thieves have not broken open the vault. Instead, they opened the ATMs vault by using its secret password, said Niraj Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (Howrah).

 We have examined the closed-circuit TV footage and fingerprint experts have been pressed into service, said Kumar.

 Only four people in a bank are supposed know the password of a particular ATM vault. They are the banks manager, chief accountant, the field officer and an officer of the agency maintaining the ATM. We shall interrogate all the employees of the SBI branch, the police superintendent said on Sunday.

 The manager of SBIs Ghoshpara branch, however, refused to comment on the defalcation. He had closed the ATM on orders from the SBI zonal office.

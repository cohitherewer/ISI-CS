 It took the city 15 hours to find a hospital bed for a 12-year-old girl suffering from cerebral haemorrhage.

 Starting late on Monday, Tumpa Khatun went from one state-run hospital to another, in vain. She was finally granted admission to SSKM Hospital from where she had been turned out twice earlier in the day following the intervention of state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra on Tuesday afternoon.

 Tumpa is a Class VI student in a local school at Kalitala village in Murshidabad district. Her father, Amjad Sheikh, is a daily wage earner. She was hit by a two-wheeler late on Friday near her house and sustained serious head injuries. She was admitted to Behrampore State General Hospital. A CT scan revealed cerebral haemorrhage and a fracture.

 Tumpas condition started deteriorating on Monday as she complained of pain in the back of her head. Doctors referred her to Calcutta. She was first brought to Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital around 11.30pm.

 After waiting for an hour in the emergency ward, doctors told us to take her to SSKM, said Muffazul Sheikh, Tumpas uncle.

 At SSKM, the medical officer in the emergency ward examined her but refused admission. They said there was no bed and advised us to take her to some other hospital, recounted her uncle. She was writhing in pain by then.

 Next stop, Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital. It was well past midnight. Doctors said the hospital did not have the infrastructure for neuro surgery.

 Tumpa was rushed back to NRS, where there was no bed. In a last-ditch attempt, her family members took her to SSKMs outpatients department in the morning. She was referred to Bangur Institute of Neurology and Psychiatry. Doctors at Bangur said she could be treated at SSKM and sent us back, said Sheikh.

 By then the matter had come to the knowledge of the health minister who instructed the SSKM authorities to admit the girl. Around 3pm, Tumpa was finally admitted to the paediatric surgery ward.

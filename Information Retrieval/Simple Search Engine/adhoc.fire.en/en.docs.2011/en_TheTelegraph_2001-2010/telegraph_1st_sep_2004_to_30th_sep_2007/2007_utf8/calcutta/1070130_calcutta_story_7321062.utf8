 Kathak creations

 Celebrating the colourful diversity of Indian dance, Nava Disha presents original choreographic creations in modern styles, keeping intact the essence of Kathak, on which the individual numbers are based. Showcasing the various tributaries and dimensions of Indian dance, it portrays the way in which Indian dance can modulate itself along the curves of contemporary ideas, while staying rooted to a traditional, classical form. The programme commences with short duet compositions by renowned choreographers Nirupama and Rajendra of Bangalore. This is followed by three items by students of Upasana Centre for Dance. Based on the cycle of nine beats, Naba Chhanda shows the transition from traditional to modern dance concepts. Reminiscences is choreographed by four students, with guidance from their mentor Ashim Bandhu Bhattacharjee. A philosophical piece, Togetherness conveys our sense of belonging with death and loneliness in life, by depicting the eternal cycle of life and death.

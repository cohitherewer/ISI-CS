The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Black belt in crime battle

 Calcuttan Of The Week 

 Picture by Bishwarup Dutta

 Name: Niloo Sherpa Chakraborty

 Whos she? The deputy superintendent of Criminal Investigation Department (CID), in charge of cybercrime, missing persons investigation and the womens grievance cell. Women are the biggest victims of online crime, says the spunky ever-smiling 35-year-old who is the fourth woman police deputy superintendent in the state.

 How did she get here? Niloo, born and brought up in Darjeeling, was barely 15 when she ran away to join a nunnery, only to be dragged back home within two hours. I was a tomboy and a black belt. I lied to my parents about going on an excursion and instead came to Calcutta for an All India Karate Championship that I won. The next day my picture was in the papers. My parents were happy, says Niloo, who completed her graduation in economics from Darjeeling Government College. 

 A deputy superintendent at 21, Niloo moved around north Bengal for more than 10 years before settling in the city. I used to be quite strict. While some used to call me names like Hunterwali and Phoolan Devi, some would fall at my feet, shocked to see a woman in police uniform. Being a woman in this profession has never been a problem, except for a lack of proper ladies toilets. 

 Memorable case: The first cyber crime case in Bengal. She steered an investigation to track down the men who had posted a fictitious profile of a married lady with her contact number on an adult website. Niloo was also part of an international team of police officers who were selected for the UN Mission to Kosovo.

 Her mantra: It is important to be a good listener. I try to give people a clear picture of the investigation. She believes in prayers, mediation and draws inspiration from Kiran Bedi. It is a must for women to be educated and financially independent. 

 Extra-curricular: Niloo tied the knot with Rajarshi Chakraborty, an excise officer, in 1996 but work kept them apart most of the time till she returned to the city in 2005. She speaks flawless Bengali now, thanks to her husband.

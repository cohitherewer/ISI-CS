 The real problem

 When it comes to obeying traffic rules, these children are more cautious than adults. They prefer to use the zebra crossing. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta 

 The Supreme Court stay on the implementation of 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in central institutions of higher education has once again turned the focus on the problems underlying the issue.

 When the quota system was introduced for those belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), it was considered a compensation for centuries of injustice meted out to them by the upper castes. But the question of their economic development has remained unanswered.

 The quota system, created ostensibly for the benefit of the backward classes, has hardly served its purpose. It has largely benefited those belonging to the upper strata of the SC/ST and the OBCs. The system has failed to cater to the economically backward section. 

 To make the quota system effective, the government should ensure that children from the weaker sections get primary and secondary education. Secondly, if a quota has to be created, it should be on the basis of economic condition and not on the basis of caste. 

 There are many general students who cannot afford to pay for higher studies. 

 The government should be cautious while introducing the quota system. The law should apply equally to all.

 Fighting pollution

 If we

 were to consider one major problem

 plaguing the world today, it would

 be the increasing level of pollution.

 This was why the Calcutta Book Fair

 was shifted from the Maidan to the

 Salt Lake stadium this year. 

 An issue discussed most frequently today is global warming and depletion of the ozone layer. But are we consciously fighting this problem? Is there any effort to spread awareness about environmental hazards? 

 Various boards in India have introduced environmental education into the curriculum to make students aware of the problems plaguing the environment today. 

 But this is hardly enough. To make the subject interesting, schools should also take the initiative to organise exhibitions, video screenings and awareness programmes that can help students interact and also promote audio-visual learning. 

 Traffic congestion is another major problem. Traffic control needs to be more systematic. 

 It is time the authorities got into action to control air pollution as the hazards that come with them can lead to agonising situations, affecting human welfare and development.

 It should be ensured that two-stroke engines gradually convert to four-stroke ones and that more vehicles switch to LPG. 

 For noise pollution, penalty is a must. Owing to pollution-related problems, health hazards are on the rise, with a marked increase in bronchiolitis, pneumonia and other respiratory problems among children and the aged.

 In addition, there has also been a rise in the number of gastro-enteritis, cholera and typhoid cases in the last five years. 

 The government needs to provide suitable alternatives to the existing scenario. But the drive also needs to come from within the individual, to contribute to the building of a better nation.

 Under threat

 Have you

 ever thought about where the jackals

 are going? The jackal, Indian fox,

 Small Indian Civet and common mongoose

 are vanishing from the city. These

 mammals play an important role in

 the ecology.

 Jackals could be seen in plentiful near Douglas Ground in Behala in the early 60s. Now a few jackals can be seen in only a handful of pockets like Salt Lake Central Park, Tolly Club and Royal Calcutta Golf Club. 

 These animals have also been observed in different parts of Jadavpur, Santoshpur and Behala. Mongooses are seen around wastelands and in the wetland areas of the city. But they are also under threat due to illegal trade. 

 In the Bikramgarh area, a group of people from Canning, South 24-Parganas, catch mongooses to sell them. 

 No proper study has yet been carried out on the mammals in the city. There is no database of their population. Vasundhara, a city-based environmental organisation, has carried out a brief study on the population of these mammals. 

 In this study, it was predicted that there are about 60-70 jackals on the premises of Royal Calcutta Golf Club. They live in a defined territory and are harmless. They have close resemblance to native dogs.

 There is no management plan for the protection of these animals which have remained in the city despite human encroachment. The authorities concerned should take immediate steps to protect the endangered animals, or they will be extinct in no time.

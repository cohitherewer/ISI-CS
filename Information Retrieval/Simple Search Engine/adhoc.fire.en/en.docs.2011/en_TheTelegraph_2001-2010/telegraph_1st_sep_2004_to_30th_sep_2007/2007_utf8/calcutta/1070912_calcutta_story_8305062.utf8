 Showcause on temple affairs

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The president, the secretary and two other members of the Kalighat Temple Committee on Tuesday appeared before Calcutta High Court following contempt proceedings moved against them for their alleged failure to manage the daily affairs of the temple.

 A division bench of the court, headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar, stated that they need not personally appear in the court for the time being but asked them to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be drawn against them for flouting the courts directive.

 Earlier, the court had passed an order asking the committee to follow the guideline it had framed for managing the temples daily affairs and offerings to the deity.

 The court in its guideline had asked the committee to stop the sebayets from selling palas and maintain the time of offering bhog to the deity. The committee was also directed to follow the rules framed by the Supreme Court and make an inventory of the deitys ornaments.

 But Ashok Haldar, a sebayet of the temple, moved a writ before the high court alleging that the committee had failed to carry out the orders.

 His advocate Pradip Roy told the court: Sebayets are still selling palas and the committee has been a mute spectator. In some cases, committee members help the sebayets sell palas.

 The committee was not taking steps against the priests who do not maintain the time of offering bhog to the goddess, he added.

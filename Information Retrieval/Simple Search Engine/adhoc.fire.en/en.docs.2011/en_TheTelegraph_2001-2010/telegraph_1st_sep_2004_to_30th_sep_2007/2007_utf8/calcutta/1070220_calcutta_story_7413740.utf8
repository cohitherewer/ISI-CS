 Rule relax for brilliance

 OUR BUREAU

 On the eve of Madhyamik, the high court on Monday directed the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education to allow an underage boy, a girl undergoing psychiatric treatment and 11 physically-challenged candidates to write the examination. The move signals a relaxation of norms for special candidates.

 Among those receiving the court nod is thirteen-and-a-half-year-old Snehasish Mahapatra of Bonhooghly School. The board had refused to issue him an admit card, citing his age. According to its norms, students below 14 cannot appear for Madhyamik.

 Justice J. Biswas of the high court directed the board to allow Snehasish, who has a brilliant academic record, to appear in the examination. 

 My client is from a poor family. His father, a mason, is mute and deaf. His mother suffers from mental ailments. Still, Snehasish has stood first in the class examinations and third in the test. But the board is not issuing him an admit card because of his age, Mahapatras lawyer told the court.

 Justice Biswas observed: It is not fair on the part of the board, considering the economic condition of the student. It should have deviated from the rules and issued him an admit card.

 In another order, the division bench of Justice P. Roy and Justice T. Giri directed the board to allow Mousumi Sinha, a student of Beltala Girls High School, to appear for the examination.

 Mousumi was denied an admit card because she has been undergoing psychiatric treatment and could not attend school regularly. The board should allow the student to write Madhyamik on humanitarian grounds, observed the judges.

 The division bench also asked the board to allow 11 students of Mahanad High School in Hooghly, who had not received their admit cards for unspecified reasons, to appear for the examinations. Police on Monday announced measures for the smooth conduct of the examination at the 136 centres in the city. 

 The thoroughfares leading to the centres will be manned and there will be curbs on use of loudspeakers and photocopiers around the venues.

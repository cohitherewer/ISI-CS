 Miniature marvels

 The Fables of Jean de la Fontaine, written towards the end of the 17th century, comprise probably one of the most famous collections of French poems about India. The French Association, French Embassy in India, in collaboration with The Palladian Lounge, Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, present Miniatures, an exhibition of miniature paintings by Imam Bakhsh Lahori, illustrating de La Fontaines fables. Jean de La Fontaine never set foot in the India of his fables. Nor did Imam Bakhsh Lahori, the artist from Punjab, know anything of the country from where his order originated. Yet these miniature works constitute the most accomplished and, perhaps, the most beautiful production of the Lahori School under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Interestingly, they also comprise the jewel of the collections of the Muse Jean de La Fontaine in France. Currently, these precious and exquisite paintings are back in India thanks to the initiative of the French Embassy. It is touring now in the Alliance Franaise network in India.

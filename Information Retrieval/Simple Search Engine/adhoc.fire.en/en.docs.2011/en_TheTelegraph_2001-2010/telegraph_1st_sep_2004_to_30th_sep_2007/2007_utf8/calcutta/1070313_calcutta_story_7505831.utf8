The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Plucky sergeant saves two

 - Governors escort in repeat of courage feat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Prosenjit Chatterjee: Sergeant braveheart. A Telegraph picture

 A traffic sergeant on governors escort duty helped avert a disaster in an LIC office in Taratala and rescued two men from being burnt to death on Monday morning.

 Prosenjit Chatterjee, the sergeant, entered the office in a fifth-floor apartment while it was in flames and braving a thick pall of black smoke, turned off the nozzle of a gas cylinder that could have exploded any moment. Had the cylinder exploded, part of the apartment could have blown off, said a fire officer. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. Chatterjee has done an excellent job, said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 Chatterjee joined duty at 6 am and was deployed at the Taratala crossing (as the governor is on leave, the sergeant has been asked to report to the south-west traffic guard). Around 8.30 am, a local youth told him the LIC office was on fire.

 I immediately informed the control room so fire brigade could be called in. Taking along a traffic constable, I then headed for the building on Diamond Harbour Road, recalled Chatterjee.

 The office staff had not yet turned up; only four canteen employees were working in the kitchen. Two of them managed to come out but they were too scared to help the sergeant.

 There was thick black smoke between the fourth and fifth floors. I crouched and entered the canteen, where the oven was in flames. The plastic pipe from the cylinder and the nozzle, too, caught fire. I covered my face with a handkerchief and turned off the regulator, which had started melting, said Chatterjee.

 He suffered breathing problems because of the smoke, but that did not deter him from rescuing the two canteen workers trapped in the kitchen.

 Last year, too, Chatterjee had shown an exemplary performance, earning kudos from the governor. While escorting Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Chatterjees motorcycle skidded because of a wire on the road. Though injured, he promptly stood up and joined the convoy. Gandhi came out of his vehicle and ordered him to immediately meet a doctor.

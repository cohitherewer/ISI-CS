 Lease of life for rally suit

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The case relating to the curb on weekday rallies on city roads is set to be reopened at Calcutta High Court.

 Following an order from Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar, the paper book of the case, which contains all relevant documents, was produced before his bench on Friday.

 On September 29, 2003, Justice Amitava Lala of the high court had issued a contempt rule against police for their failure to take action against the organisers of a rally that had obstructed his car.

 The judge asked the police not to allow rallies on city roads from 8am to 8pm on weekdays. On October 1, 2003, a division bench issued an interim stay on the order, after the state submitted that it would chalk out a plan to solve rally-related problems.

 The case has not come up for hearing since then. A couple of days ago, advocate Idris Ali told the chief justice that he suspected a conspiracy, as the paper book was not being produced. Justice Nijjars order followed the submission.

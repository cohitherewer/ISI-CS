 Hunt on for blast aides

 - Arrested Lashkar operative had links in Jorasanko, say sleuths

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 City-based Lashkar-e-Toiba operative Sheikh Sameer, arrested for his links with the prime suspect in last Fridays Hyderabad blast, had associates in Jorasanko, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has found. 

 The detectives are on the hunt for the associates, who they believe have information on Mohammad Andul Sahed, alias Bilal, identified as the mastermind behind the blast at Mecca Masjid. 

 Sameer, who was based in Jorasanko and is in Mumbai Police custody, has confessed to meeting Bilal and discussing the safe points along the Indo-Bangla border for terrorists to sneak in. The two had also discussed the use of explosives. 

 The reports of Sameers narco-analysis tests have arrived. After going through the transcripts, we will probe deeper for information about Bilal. We have handed over information about the SIM card found at the blast site to Hyderabad Police, said additional director-general of the CID Bhupinder Singh. 

 The sleuths are also on the trail of Babulal Yadav, who bought the SIM card from a shop in Asansol. He had made three calls, of very short duration, during the period the SIM card was active, according to the CID.

 One of the calls was made to a coaching centre in Varanasi, the other to a man in Delhi and the third to Uttar Pradesh. The SIM card was de-activated after the service provider found that false information had been provided in the application form for the card.

 We have a photograph of Babulal and are in the process of finding out more about him. It appears that the three calls made by him using the SIM have no bearing with his supposed links with the terrorists. The calls may have been made to divert attention, said a senior CID officer.

 The detectives believe that a handset may have been used as a timer with the defunct SIM. They are trying to find out how Babulal had obtained a forged driving licence and where it was made. 

 It is not clear whether Babulal lived in Asansol or was passing through.

 According to sources in the CID, some members of a Bangladeshi gang suspected of being part of the blast plot are still holed up in the city and its adjoining areas. Hyderabad Police have reportedly sought help from the CID to trace the gang members. 

 If Hyderabad Police seek help from us to hunt down anyone, we will cooperate fully. Our team is on the job. Whatever we find, we will share with our counterparts in Hyderabad, said a senior CID officer.

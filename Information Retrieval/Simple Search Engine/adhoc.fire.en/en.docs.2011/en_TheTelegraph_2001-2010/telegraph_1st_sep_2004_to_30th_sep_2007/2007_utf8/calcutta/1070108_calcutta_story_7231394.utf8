 The city police stand accused of illegally occupying a building meant for the rehabilitation of evicted hawkers.

 The Gol Park building, owned by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), was rented out to police in 2001 when Gariahat thana was being renovated. The force had reportedly assured the civic authorities that it would vacate the premises as soon as the renovation was over.

 The police station moved to its original address in August 2006, but the force is still occupying the three-storeyed building, opposite Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, for housing a Reserve Force battalion.

 In an attempt to take possession of the building, the civic body has decided to take up the matter with the state home department.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the building was constructed to rehabilitate hawkers. Now that Gariahat thana has shifted to the original address, I dont know why Calcutta Police is still occupying the building. It should vacate it immediately, he asserted.

 Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Kumar Chatterjee refused comment. I do not have any knowledge about it. You should ask Sudhir Mishra, joint commissioner (organisation). Mishra could not be contacted.

 A senior civic official said the Reserve Force battalion had moved in a day after the police station shifted to the renovated building.

 The building has turned into a barrack. Senior officers had assured us that it would be handed over to the civic body in September, but things have remained the same. We have no option but to write to the home department, seeking intervention, pointed out.

 Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, during whose tenure the building was rented out, said police had violated norms.

 They had approached me for hiring the building for a brief period, as Gariahat police station needed to be renovated. Considering the problem, I agreed to the proposal, but they were supposed to hand the building back to the CMC as soon as the renovation was over, Mukherjee said. But they have not done so, in gross violation of the agreement. The present board, too, has been lackadaisical.

 A senior police officer indicated that the Reserve Force battalion had to be shifted to the building because of a lack of space at Bodyguard Lines, the armed police headquarters in Alipore. The Centre has released funds for modernisation of the force... We have plans to construct highrises, where the barracks will be shifted, he added.

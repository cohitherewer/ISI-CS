 Children killed in mishap

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A 16-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl were killed after a truck hit the motorcycle they were riding near Mohammad Ali Park, on Chittaranjan Avenue, on Saturday night.

 The children, residents of Syed Saleh Lane in Mechhua, were on their way to a dawat on father Mohammad Mustak Ahmeds motorcycle.

 The 52-year-old rammed into a road divider after being hit by the truck from behind. Tahrin, 11, and Tanzeb, 16, who were riding pillion, were thrown off the two-wheeler. 

 The truck ran over Tahrins head and Tanzebs abdomen. They were taken to Medical College and Hospital. Tahrin died minutes later, while Tanzeb was shifted to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, where he died on Sunday morning, said an officer of Jorasanko police station. 

 The boy had severe head injuries and was in such a state that it was not possible to operate on him, said a doctor at the hospital.

 According to Ahmed, the driver of the truck was moving very fast to avoid traffic policemen at the Mahatma Gandhi Road-Chittaranjan Avenue Avenue crossing, who were collecting bribes. 

 The police denied the allegation.

 Ahmeds cousin Rehman Latif said: Immediately after the mishap, my cousin asked the constable on duty at the crossing to come to his aid, but he refused, saying it would not be possible for him to leave his post till a traffic sergeant turned up. A part of the night show crowd from Moonlight cinema came to Ahmeds rescue.

 He added: Officers from the local traffic guard and Jorasanko police station turned up much later.

 Tahrin studied in Class IV of an English-medium school off Zakaria Street, while Tanzeb was a Class VIII student of an English-medium school in Bowbazar.

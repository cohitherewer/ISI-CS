The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Prince Charles and Team India chance 

 Cyber Cal 

 Cricket invades the virtual space as it does our bedroom with India having played its first match of World Cup 2007 on Saturday.

 Cricket lovers have formed communities like The Blue Billion Rises in anticipation of victory. Such a huge upheaval is a scary prospect, but if there is one thing that can unite Calcuttans with the rest of their countrymen, it is a love for cricket, especially since Dada is there.

 The Prince of Calcutta Sourav Ganguly Fan Club and Win The World Cup Sourav Ganguly (started by namesake Saurav Banerjee) communities aim at the same thing. To encourage Sourav who has risen from the ashes. 

 Orkut is also betting on who will be the man of the series for the World Cup. There is little doubt, it seems, that India will win the Cup.

 As Calcuttan Tathagata Maulik scribbles in one of the communities: Cup to hamara hai.

 In another community, Tarun reasons: In 1981, Prince Charles married, Liverpool became the champions, Aussies lost the Ashes, the Pope died. Two years later in 1983 India won the World Cup. In 2005, Prince Charles married (again), Liverpool became the champions, Aussies lost the Ashes, the Pope died. Two years later in 2007 India wins the Cup?

 Votes for the man of the series slot is shared by Dada and the man who has also long enjoyed Bong loyalty, Tendulkar. One scrap is unkind enough to question what Rahul Dravid will do when mentor Greg Chappell leaves after the World Cup, but another member reminds that the focus now should be on the match. 

 Novices to the game will do well to browse through Sudiptos preview, where he touches on everything on Indias choice for the opening slot, Virendra Sehwags scanty runs and the problems in the bowling section.

 And as if the men in blue needed more musical motivation! Presto Studio from Calcutta has uploaded the song ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 Cheer up India on www.youtube.com.

 Responses to the video range from very good to not a very professional attempt to bad. There should be a ban on any more World Cup music. 

 P.S. Is it a good thing to be reminded again and again that we are a billion-strong nation, even if we are blue?

 Civic eye on attendance 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After e-governance, the civic body has turned its focus on work culture.

 Funds from the Rs 220-crore capacity-building programme will be spent on installing advanced gadgets to ensure employees are punctual in entering and leaving office.

 A civic official said the scheme on work culture will replace attendance registers, which leave enough scope for manipulation, with a foolproof, computerised data recording system.

 An official pointed out that such a system is the need of the hour, as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), like Writers Buildings and other state government offices, has been plagued by late attendance.

 Early this week, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya paid a surprise visit to some sections and found that over 40 per cent of the employees had not turned up even 45 minutes after the attendance timing. All of them were marked absent.

 There are, however, several employees who come to office on time and if need be, stay beyond the duty hours. And these employees are not all officers. There are several who are in the Class IV category, said mayor Bhattacharyya.

 A consultant advising the CMC on work culture said most civic employees in the upper levels are more disciplined than those in government offices.

 Its unthinkable to come across officials and engineers in government offices at 8pm. In civic offices, its a daily sight, said the consultant.

 Civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the authorities are yet to decide on the type of gadgets to be installed to monitor the attendance of the 37,000-strong workforce. There are several options. We will choose the one that best suits the civic body.

 A source, however, said the authorities are not considering a smartgate-type solution. 

 A smartgate opens on swiping a distinctive card, like the identity card. But then, employees can hand over their cards to a colleague who will swipe them on time. Were considering a system in which each employee will have to be present before the gadget to register his attendance.

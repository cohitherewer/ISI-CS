 When Celina Jaitley, in town for the inauguration of the Health amp; Glow Clinic at Salkia, stepped out of her cherry-coloured Sonata, little did she know there was no beating the Howrah hullabaloo when it comes to star-gazing. Broken glass pane, camera clicks vs security cordon, the mammoth crowd awaiting a glimpse of the Janasheen girl it was chaos spelt with a capital C.

 But miss congeniality chose to brush it off as the love and adulation of the public. No one the organisers, the crowd or the security is at fault. Dont politicians face the same situation? Isnt there stampede at the Kumbh Mela? smiled Celina, all covered up in a black sari.

 Minutes later, the former Miss India spoke to GoodLife about beauty, Bollywood and more. 

 Cosmetic call: With Celina, what you see is not what you hear. She looks all Botox and silicon but insists that nothing about her is cosmetic. The only surgery that I had was an appendix removal as a kid. I am 100 per cent, ISI-stamped natural, said Celina, with a cosmetic laugh.

 On a more serious note, she advocated beauty through alternative medicine. The biggest of skin problems have their answers in homeopathy and Ayurveda.

 Her prescription for beauty treatment at home: besan-and-milk pack. 

 Fitness facts: The secret behind that sexy figure eating right and exercise keep me fit, internally and physically. Yoga and meditation is also a must.

 Body beautiful: The Bollywood belle is hardly complaining about her bombshell tag. After all that crowd appreciation, should I be complaining? There is a fine line between vulgarity and sensuousness. I never try and go overboard, she argued.

 The bikini acts might have backfired at the box-office, but Celina has taken it in her stride without any regrets. Today, wearing a swimsuit is not an issue. I definitely know where to draw the line. It all depends on the director you are working with and the comfort level you share.

 Career moves: Post Janasheen it was comedy, comedy and more comedy. Currently I am looking at roles with variations. I want to do good work and restrict myself to three-four films a year, said Celina. Forthcoming films for the sexy siren include Red with a PLU (people like us) look and Suneel Darshans Shaka Laka Boom Boom with a glam image. 

 New Year notes: I do not make New Year resolutions. I take life as it comes, signed off Celina.

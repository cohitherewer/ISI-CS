 Xponse Technologies defied the 24x7 work principle of the tech town on Thursday as no one logged into the computers. 

 Instead of the normal hustle-bustle, the seventh and eighth floors at Kariwala Towers, in EP block of Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec), wore a deserted look. 

 The drawn shutters, padlocks snapped on the gates and the panchnama pasted on the wall were indicating the bumpy ride ahead for over 350 employees of Sanjay Kedia, who was arrested on Sunday for alleged dealings with a US firm linked to a drug cartel. 

 The employees left yesterday after the police sealed the office and no one came to work today, said an employee of Kariwala Industries, which owns the building. 

 Only a young man, who claimed he was supposed to join Xponse from today, turned up As the office was closed, he went off, added the man, in charge of building maintenance. 

 With Xponse dragged into a controversy over selling of drugs and sealed by the Narcotics Control Bureau for some time, the young man will have to look for a new job. 

 Though some Xponse employees are on a wait-and-watch mode, a majority of the 350-plus workforce has already hit the job-street. 

 I have received applications from Xponse employees, said a senior officer of a Saltlec-based software company. 

 For Xponse employees, bagging a new job will be easier said than done, feels a section of the recruiters. 

 A prospective employer is bound to ask about an applicants previous work experience and if the company is in disrepute, it will definitely not be an advantage for him or her, explained Siddhartha Mukherjee, vice-president, Cognizant Technology Solutions. 

 But there are others, who think that the company tag will not be much of a problem. 

 The employees cannot be blamed for the promoters mistakes. It is true that Tier 1 companies may not employ them, but there are a number of small companies, which need people with experience, and they will scoop up the best of the resources, said the HR head of a leading IT company.

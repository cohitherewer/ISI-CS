The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Loneliness of urban space

 - SAMIT DAS S SHOW REFLECTS HIS FASCINATION FOR BUILT

 ENVIRONMENT

 SOUMITRA DAS

 There is a building boom at Galerie 88. Youngish Samit Das of Delhi has imaged his fascination for the built environment of metros on various large and small canvases and paper works. As the title of the exhibition, B/W, suggests, all the works are in black and white with the exception of dashes of rust. 

 Das creates a world of shadows and light, a composite of vertical and horizontal planes, of greys and sepia, of grids and secret pathways, circuitous plumbing lines (perhaps), and sunlight seeping through the slats of jalousied windows.

 An element common to most of his works is the flight of stairs leading into undefined space. The steps are often sunlit. Yet there is not a soul in sight. Depeopled urban space deepens the sense of loneliness. 

 These landscapes of silence look more stark because of the sharply contrasting shades with which they are defined.

 Some of his small drawings and larger canvases remind you of structures as complex and eccentric as the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris with its exposed service elements outside the buildings framework. He tries to get things inside out. Das often supplements his art work with architectural elements recreated with paper and superimposed on the surface of either paper or canvas.

 Dass works often remind you of the paintings of Gaganendranath Tagore once he was exposed to cubism. They are also reminiscent of the sets of the Bohurupee production of Tagores play Raktakarabi. They have the same aura of mystery, although Das uses photographs to produce the desired effect. This is not surprising, for Das was trained at Santiniketan and he is an avid photographer.

 He has also created books similarly structured which you can leaf through. Like his paintings, these books are layered with multiple planes made of paper (not far removed from the excavated remains of some ancient metropolis), photocopies of sections of structures and painted areas all merging into a single entity that has every possibility of disintegrating through constant thumbing. 

 Quite as vulnerable as the spaces they depict.

 Strokes of realism

 An idealist who desired to savour every nuance of simple, rustic life, Bhaskar Mukherjee consciously moved away from the city to make Birbhum the centre of his prolific creative activities: sketching, drawing, painting and sculpting. Rooted in Realism, the ongoing exhibition of his paintings and drawings, reveals his multi-faceted talent as an artist. His realm of expression transcends beyond the simplistic depiction of his co-habitants in Birbhums villages like santhal men and women, birds and insects, flora and fauna. His works are, in fact, a bold, powerful, living statement of his vision and philosophy of life. His brush strokes portray nature in full bloom, as also in its terrifying, violent aspects. Human faces, dogs, goats or even lizards stare at the viewer, as if to tell the woeful tale of the erosion of old values, or of the sad urbanisation of villages. Questioning the viewer at every stage, Mukherjees works evoke mixed feelings of scepticism and optimism, distress and happiness.

 Event: Paintings and drawings by Bhaskar Mukherjee When: Till June 2 (except Sunday); 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Kanishkas, 2/1 Hindustan Road

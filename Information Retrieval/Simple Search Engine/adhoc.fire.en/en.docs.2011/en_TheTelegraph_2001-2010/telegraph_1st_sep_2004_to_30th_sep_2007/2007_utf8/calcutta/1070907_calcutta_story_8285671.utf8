 Trouble broke out at Medical College and Hospital (MCH) on Thursday morning after a three-day-old girl died due to alleged negligence of the hospital staff. The babys relatives claimed they were beaten up by hospital guards. 

 My wife Suman delivered a girl in the maternity ward of Eden block on Sunday. Everything was fine till Wednesday evening. Suddenly on Thursday morning, we were told that the baby had died, said father Deepkumar Das. 

 But that was not all. Later in the day, when he tried to take his 12-year-old niece to visit his wife, the security guard at the gate refused to let her in.

 Things turned ugly as the guard, Sheokumar, allegedly demanded money to let the girl enter. He persisted with the demand, paying no heed to the fact that my baby had just died, said Das.

 A quarrel broke out and the guard and three of his colleagues started manhandling Dass female relatives. They tried to push us out but when we resisted, the four guards started beating us up, said Sujata, Das relative.

 A group of about 25 people, claiming to be the patients relatives, was trying to go in. They were hurling abuses at me and even started beating me up once I opened the gate. Some of my colleagues, who were standing nearby, rushed to my rescue and a melee followed. We, too, kicked and punched some of them to save ourselves, said Sheokumar. 

 Amarendranath Biswas, the deputy superintendent of MCH, however, admitted that the guards had beaten up Dass relatives. We have started an inquiry. If he is found guilty, we will take action against Sheokumar, he said.

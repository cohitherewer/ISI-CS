 Calcutta airport on Thursday had three unusual passengers Rustam, Bhopu and Brahmaputra. They were one-horned male Indian rhinos who boarded a Singapore Airlines flight on their way to San Diego zoo, in the US. Rustam and Bhopu came from Patna and Brahmaputra from Delhi.

 The trio was being sent to the US zoo as part of an exchange programme. Earlier this month, San Diego zoo had sent three giraffes (two female and a male) and four female rhinos to Patna and one male and two female zebras to Delhi.

 The US zoo needs male rhinos and we need females and hence, the exchange, explained Rakesh Kumar, director of Patna zoo. We need to maintain genetic variability among the animals. There are 10 rhinos in our zoo. If the same animals are used for reproduction, the offspring might develop critical diseases that can even lead to their death.

 Rustam is five-and-a-half years old and weighs 2.5 tonnes, while Bhopu is two years younger and weighs 1.5 tonnes. They reached Calcutta on Wednesday night in a truck. Three-year-old Brahmaputra, weighing two tonnes, arrived on a cargo flight.

 They will reach Singapore early on Friday and from there, will take a 20-hour flight to Los Angeles, said Amin Khan, of Singapore Airlines Cargo Ltd. Two veterinary doctors are accompanying them.

 Airport officials said the three had meals comprising 120 kg of grass, a 12-kg mixture of wheat and gram and six dozen bananas. Ten jars, each containing 25 litres of mineral water, were finished in seconds and had to be refilled, said Khan.

 Rock rhythms of France

 On the occasion of The Fete de la Musique (World Music Day), the French Embassy and the French Association host a nine-city music tour of India featuring popular, new-generation performing artistes of France, who share the stage with Indian bands representing new-age Indian music, like No Idea, SOAP and Span. This evening, Mademoiselle K and her troupe (by the same name) showcase their unique brand of rock music, offering the audience an opportunity to soak in the true spirit of pure, unbridled rock n roll. The Parisian rockers will be preceded by local band Span, performing an acoustic set of their intelligent brand of originals. Rages and break-ups, failures and crashing deceptions, all to the sound of throaty vocals, is what describes Mademoiselle Ks music best. With influences as diverse as Nina Simone and Radiohead, the quartets music sits between leather-clad rock and garage punk sounds, built over crushing guitars and plodding rhythms.

 Event: Music concert featuring French artistes and Indian band Span When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Princeton Club, 26 Prince Anwar Shah Road

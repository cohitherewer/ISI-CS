 IFA accountant in net, hint of swindle

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two weeks after a fire broke out at the office of the Indian Football Association (IFA), the detective department of the city police arrested an employee of the soccer body. 

 Kaushik Chandra, accountant of the IFA, was rounded up from his Bauria home in Howrah on Tuesday morning. The 32-year-old, whom police suspect to be behind the mystery fire, was later produced in a city court and remanded in police custody till April 2.

 Till now, it appears to be a case of arson. We think Chandra possibly wanted to tamper with certain evidences related to the IFAs accounts, said Gyanwant Singh, city detective chief. 

 Police claimed that Chandra played a role in misappropriation of funds around Rs 30 lakh in the past five to seven months in the IFA.

 There is surely more than what meets the eye, said detective chief Singh, adding that more details of mismanagement are expected to tumble out as the probe progresses.

 Late on the night of March 13, a fire broke out at the Chandni Chowk office of the IFA. It was doused by three tenders.

 According to police, Chandra left office around 7.30 pm that day, only to return after half-an-hour. 

 He finally signed out around 9.30 pm and took the durwan along with him for a cup of tea. When the durwan returned, he noticed the fire. 

 Probing the case, the detective department officers turned up with forensic experts the next day and found that the fire was confined to just two racks of a cupboard in Chandras room. 

 An inquiry was going on in the accounts department We got some cheque books and it was clear that something was wrong, said an officer. 

 While scanning the IFA accounts books, the sleuths also spotted anomalies in payments made against vouchers. We have slapped a case of falsification of accounts against Chandra, said Singh.

 Nurses stop work 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Treatment of patients at SSKM Hospital was disrupted on Monday morning when nurses agitated for more than four hours, demanding punishment for a police officer who allegedly assaulted one of their colleagues on June 15.

 Police arrested Pronab Sarkar, a Calcutta Police employee, on Monday evening.

 Sandhya Ghosh, the nurse allegedly beaten up by the officer, went on a fast at the hospital around 8.15am on Monday. This prompted some of her colleagues to rush in from various wards and operation theatres and participate in a relay sit-in.

 A number of surgeries were delayed at the gynaecology and cardio-thoracic departments, said Ashok K. Ghosh, SSKM medical superintendent. Other medical work was also affected by the stop work.

 The nurses first gheraoed Ghosh and the hospitals nursing superintendent. Later, they started a sit-in on the ground floor of Lytton Building, which houses the nurses hostel. 

 The evenings arrest did not satisfy the agitating nurses.We want exemplary punishment for the man who hit our colleague. Only arresting him will not do. If he gets bail, our agitation will continue, quot; said an agitating nurse.

 The superintendent said: The allegation of assaulting a nurse is serious and we are dealing with it. Ghosh met the agitating nurses and Sandhya, who is now being treated in the Queens Ward of the hospital.

 While assuring Sandhya and her colleagues of necessary action, the hospital superintendent also criticised the stop-work by the nurses. We are standing by our staff and based on their deputation, have lodged a complaint with the police. But the way a section of nurses stopped work cannot be tolerated, Ghosh said.

 After the meeting with Ghosh, the agitating nurses decided to resume work but continued with the sit-in. 

 Police officer Pronab Sarkar allegedly hit Sandhya in the new casualty block of the hospital on June 15. 

 He was accompanying his brother Prabhat, officer-in-charge of Bhangabera police camp in Nandigram, who was hit by a bullet while on duty on June 15 and rushed to SSKM around 3.55pm. 

 Pronab felt his brother was not being properly attended to in the hospital.

 Schools global ties

 Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA) 

 recently won the International School Award instituted by 

 British Council. The award aims to build ties among schools 

 in India and abroad. 

 With liberalisation, the world 

 has come closer and in this global village a citizen ought 

 to be a world citizen, said principal Meena Kak. While 

 working for the award, we tried to bring about a shift in 

 traditional teaching methods by exchanging ideas with other 

 schools, she explained.

 Students from classes I to X shared 

 projects, including a comparative study of British and Indian 

 English and folk tales around the world. They created painted 

 paper aprons with scenes from daily life and discussed the 

 contribution of human resource rich countries to the United 

 Nations.

 Through the year-long initiative, 

 LSA built up ties with participating schools in other countries, 

 including Pakistans Lahore Lyceum School, Prince Henrys 

 Grammar School Specialist Language College in the UK and 

 Seyhan eas Anatolian High School, Turkey The students exchanged 

 ideas through post and email. 

 There was Out of the Front Window, 

 a project where students represented the scene outside the 

 school premises through sketches. These would be exchanged 

 with students of other countries.

 The award has helped bring uniformity 

 in the curriculum. This will help young minds find easy 

 access to schools and universities the world over, believes 

 Anjali Chopra, headmistress, LSA.

 Shout out loud

 Whats on your 

 mind this week

 A relative of the Guwahati 

 blast victim grieves on September 1 

 Face of terror

 A group of engineering students, 

 a young boy celebrating his success in the medical entrance 

 examination and other innocent people including children 

 they all have one thing in common. They are victims of 

 terrorism who lost their lives in the Hyderabad blast that 

 shook the country once again on August 17. 

 For hundreds of families, time 

 had come to a standstill. Fear of more bloodshed loomed 

 large and life was paralysed. 

 But the situation is not limited 

 to Hyderabad alone. Terrorism has gripped every corner of 

 the globe directly or indirectly. A group of people, not 

 happy with the socio-political development around them, 

 are targeting the common man, shaking society to its roots. 

 These groups believe their acts of terrorism are divinely 

 sanctioned. 

 It seems that mankinds fight 

 against terrorism is like a game of chess, only that the 

 opponents moves are unpredictable and incomprehensible. 

 No cause can justify the game. So what if the lives of innocent 

 people are at stake. It still remains a holy war where 

 innocent people are scapegoats.

 Real trouble

 The West Bengal governments policy 

 of banning the hand-pulled rickshaw not only means no more 

 traditional rickshaws on city roads but also that the decision 

 will affect more than 20,000 people, directly or indirectly. 

 The livelihood of these people is at stake. 

 According to the government, the 

 the drive is being undertaken on humanitarian grounds 

 and in the chief ministers words: They were clogging the 

 already-congested city streets. In that case, tramways 

 should be the first choice in the government list, but it 

 argues that the latter has heritage value. Does that mean 

 that the hand-pulled rickshaws dont fall under the category? 

 The ban on hand-pulled rickshaws 

 means almost 12,000 people losing their jobs. Most are unskilled 

 labourers and cannot be absorbed into other sectors. So 

 the most pertinent question is whether the government has 

 plans to provide alternative means of income to these men. 

 Though the state government had 

 promised compensation to these rickshaw pullers, it is highly 

 doubtful when the promises will materialise.

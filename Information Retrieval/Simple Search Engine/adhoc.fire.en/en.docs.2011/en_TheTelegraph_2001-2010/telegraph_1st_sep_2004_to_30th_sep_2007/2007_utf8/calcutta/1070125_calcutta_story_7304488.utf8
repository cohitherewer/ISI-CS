 Bling bags 

 othes have gone simple. Bags have got themselves bling. The look balances out beautifully. Handbags have had it great the last few seasons. Flashy leather numbers, denim jholas, batuas, metallic hobos, tiny clutches The style story has followed quite an eclectic route. The drama reaches quite a climax this time around. The bag is shiny, shimmery and shocking.

 Designer Manish Malhotra says that bags just have to be full of bling. He adds: The base should be shiny. Or a matte base can be made OTT (over the top) with embellishments.

 The shape and size varies. Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee says that nothing right now in fashion is a medium size. Everything is either too big or small. It applies to bags too, he says.

 Gold gala 

 The neck continues to be the focal point this season. The colourful beaded mala has given way to chunky metal. 

 Lots of chains in gold encircle the neck. The look at the moment is very Versace. It is very chunky, very gold, not at all matte, very bold and bright and very sexy, adds Sabyasachi.

 Designer Anamika Khanna is all for the inter-linked chain look. She suggests putting together different fun pieces to get the right effect. Use four or five mismatched strings, throw in some danglers, maybe a few charms and also a rudraksh or two for the quirkiness. The effect should be chunky and irregular, she suggests. 

 Belt it 

 After years of the waist going low, lower and still lower, inspiring terms like muffin top (that indicate popping fat above low-waist clothes), today it is back where it belongs. Higher the better is the mantra for the waist now. And with the rising waistline, belts too have climbed up the ladder.

 The belt has gone slim and metallic this season. Wear it to dress up even a sweater, points out Anamika. 

 Sabyasachi agrees: Last year was all about big, broad belts with chunky buckles, but because of the strong secretarial look, the belts are not more than an-inch-and-a-half. It is most often glossy, in patent leather, teamed with a cotton dress. The look is then very poor-Cinderella-meets-Paris Hilton sort of innocence meets sensuality. 

 Shade story

 So you bought them last year? The good news is that you can hang on to them this season too. Wear them big. Wear them bright. When it comes to your shades, retro is still in all through spring-summer 2007. They are perfect to face the spring sun in Calcutta and take you through the hotter summer months too. 

 If you havent bought yours yet, get going fast. Make sure they are oversized, shell-framed and everything filmi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A queue conundrum ails the airport

 - Space crunch, lack of X-ray machines and dearth of check-in counters cause long wait

 Queue 1: To enter the airport building. Queue 2: To proceed to the check-in area. Queue 3: For X-ray of registered luggage. Queue 4: To check in at the airline counter. Queue 5: For security clearance. Queue 6: At the boarding gate. Welcome to the queue raj at the airport.

 Shortage of space, lack of X-ray machines for security check and registered luggage scan, narrow entrances to the check-in lounge and dearth of check-in counters have translated to interminable waits for fliers at the airport. The infrastructure crunch has been exposed by the increase in air traffic from about 130 daily last year to about 210 daily now.

 During peak hours, it takes nearly 90 minutes for a passenger to complete the formalities before boarding a flight, complained ghazal singer Aruna Kundanani, a frequent flier.

 According to airport officials, four domestic flights and two international flights can be handled every hour at the airport with the existing infrastructure. But in the mornings and evenings, eight to 10 domestic flights and three to four international flights take off and land per hour, they said.

 The Airports Authority of India has taken up a Rs 10-crore project to expand the domestic terminal and add facilities. Airport director V.K. Monga also said the airports capacity is being boosted. The results are not showing yet. 

 The plans include erection of a canopy to increase the lounge space. Fourteen more check-in counters have been set up at the domestic terminal, taking their number to 42. Three cash counters have also been set up. But the queues continue. The narrow entrance to the check-in lounge will cause a bottleneck, predicted a CISF officer. 

 To avoid congestion in the security hold on the ground floor, five X-ray machines will be installed in two new security holds on the first floor. Monga said the counters would be commissioned by May. 

 According to the officials, this will not make the queues disappear. The men at the counters and the X-ray machines are overworked, explained an official. A hand baggage X-ray machine is supposed to scan 300 bags in one hour, but during peak hours, at least 100 more bags are scanned, he added.

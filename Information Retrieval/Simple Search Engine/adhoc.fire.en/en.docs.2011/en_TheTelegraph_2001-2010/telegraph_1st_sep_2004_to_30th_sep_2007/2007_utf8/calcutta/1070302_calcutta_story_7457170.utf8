The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Purse for ponds and parks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The environment department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will get its first allotment of funds in fiscal 2007-08.

 The department was set up in 2004-05, when Subrata Mukherjee was mayor, but has since been functioning without funds or an office of its own.

 Sources said the civic budget for 2007-08 will propose an allotment of within Rs 2 crore for the green wing. The decision was taken on Wednesday, after a meeting among major Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and mayoral council member (environment) Sushil Sharma.

 The sources indicated that the total outlay of the 2007-08 budget to be tabled in the last week of March will be around Rs 2,000 crore, up from Rs 1,200 crore in the last fiscal.

 According to the plan, a pollution management unit will be set up under a deputy chief engineer. A bulk of the allotment for the green wing will be utilised to preserve ponds and open spaces across the city.

 The environment has to be taken into account in any development plan, though its proper upkeep requires a lot of funds. We will do whatever we can with our limited resources, said the mayor.

 Civic records reveal that there are around 3,500 ponds in the city, mostly on the eastern fringes and in pockets of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur. Certain pockets in north Calcutta, like Cossipore and South Sinthee, too, have a fairly large concentration of waterbodies.

 The CMC had hit upon 4,571 waterbodies across the city while preparing a list in 1997-98, based on an aerial survey in 1979. Which means more than 1,000 ponds have been swallowed up by the realty boom in 10 years.

 Whatever be the allocation, my department will strive to preserve the ponds and open spaces, said mayoral council member Sharma.

 The civic commissioner refused to comment.

 Dressed in a uniform

 -There rsquo;s a code for every aspect of American social life

 Americans are individualistic. They dont follow social norms and do what they want. Not true. The longer you live in the US, the clearer it becomes that there are unwritten codes that everyone follows and usually without question.

 Since its right after NY Fashion Week, I will start with clothes. You can easily identify the working men in New York City just by their clothes. Khaki pants and blue shirt is the norm, sometimes alternated with a white shirt or checks. If it is a suit, it has to be blue or grey. White T-shirts can be worn, but only during summer.

 Come winter everyone switches to black. For the adventurous women, the winter colour palette can stretch to brown or grey. This is doubly surprising when you consider that self-expression and creativity is the argument for not having uniforms in US schools. 

 High heels are another such rule. Working women will invariably wear high-heels, no matter how many band-aids they need on ankles, toes and knees. One of the most common sights during 9/11 and the famous black-out of 2004 was that of discarded high-heels on the sidewalks, as women too tired to walk in them abandoned their favourite footwear. But, of course, they were back at work the next day in yet another pair of stilettos.

 Social norms dictate many other aspects of American life. The trains and buses in the morning are dream-like in their silence. No one ever talks, in sharp contrast to the Calcutta minis! The protocol is such that if the regulars do talk, they do so in hushed tones and keep their conversations brief. People speaking loudly are met with disapproving glares and you know for sure that they are hapless tourists. Even on Election Day 2004 when Bush won the second term a day of high drama the trains were silent. It was as if nothing had happened.

 As a newcomer nobody tells you these rules, you just learn them. Rules make life easier, for everyone knows what is expected. Take for instance the casual dinner party on Saturday nights. You go with a bottle of wine for the host and hostess. Always? Yes, always and if you want variety, a box of chocolates. It is a well-known secret that these bottles are hardly ever opened by the recipients. They are often passed onto other hosts at other dinner parties, and its common to see a distinctive bottle you gave a friend at another common friends house.

 In sharp contrast to the big, chaotic Indian weddings, American weddings are planned, every-detail-worked-out affairs including a rehearsal dinner the night before to iron out any kinks! The bride and the groom will set up a gift-registry which lists items that they would like to receive. With the wedding invitation comes information of the fancy store where the gift registry has been set up. Guests can browse in the store or go online and pick out what the would-be couple wants. Of course you can choose not to pick from the gift registry and surprise the couple with a new selection. But who wants to keep guessing? 

 Its hard to say when and how these rules started, but codes on conduct, clothes and festivities certainly take the guesswork out. Or, I wonder sometimes, do they just make life more predictable and less interesting?

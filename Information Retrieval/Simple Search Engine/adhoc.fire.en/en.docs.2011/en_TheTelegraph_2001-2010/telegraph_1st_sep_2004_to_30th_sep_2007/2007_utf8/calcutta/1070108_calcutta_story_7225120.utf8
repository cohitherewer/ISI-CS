 Drive to stop water waste

 A STAFF REPORTER

 While the civic authorities are spending crores every year to set up and maintain booster pumping stations, waste of filtered surface water continues unchecked.

 In an attempt to rectify the imbalance, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has undertaken a campaign to motivate around 50,000 house-owners to instal ball-cocks in their underground reservoirs.

 The target: to save 40 million gallons of filtered water daily equivalent to the combined capacity of all the booster pumping stations worth Rs 14 crore.

 There are 2.36 lakh underground tanks in the city, but the civic authorities have identified 50,000 in the first phase of save-water campaign.

 The ball-cock it takes Rs 200 to instal the device and the house-owners will have to bear the cost plugs a reservoir automatically when it is full.

 I seek active cooperation from the house-owners to make the scheme a success. It will ultimately benefit each of them, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said it is a crime to waste filtered water when it takes Rs 3 to treat and supply 1,000 litres of water. The cost for setting up a 40-million-gallon-capacity water-treatment plant is over Rs 200 crore, he pointed out.

 The decision to launch a vigorous campaign for installing ball-cocks has been taken following the success of an experimental scheme in Garfa.

 By motivating only 1,200 house-owners to instal ball-cocks, filtered water worth Rs 34 lakh could be saved. 

 Besides, the water pressure in the neighbourhood improved significantly.

 Water flowing from road-side taps even after supply hours is a common sight in Calcutta, said director-general (water supply) Bibhas Maity. The water is coming from your reservoirs, as in most cases, the inlet pipes are much below the brim.

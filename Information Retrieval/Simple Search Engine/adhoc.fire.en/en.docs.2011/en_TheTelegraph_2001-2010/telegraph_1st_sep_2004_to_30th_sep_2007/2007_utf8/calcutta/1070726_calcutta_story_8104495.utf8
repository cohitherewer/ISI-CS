 CU, JU science wings upgrade plea snubbed 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The University Grants Commission (UGC) has rejected the applications of two science departments of Calcutta and Jadavpur universities for an upgrade to the level of a centre of advanced studies.

 The physics department of CU and the mathematics department of JU had moved the applications under the UGCs special assistance programme.

 We do not know what had prompted the UGC to reject our application. The funding agency has not pointed out any drawbacks of the department, said Gautam Gangopadhyay, a senior teacher of physics at CU.

 The university had sent the application in 2003, though the UGC carried out the inspection only recently. We have no clue why they took so long to conduct the inspection.

 The JU authorities, however, attributed the rejection to a communication gap over the last date of submission of the application.

 Parthapratim Biswas, a member of JUs executive council, said the rejection was not linked to the performance of the mathematics department. 

 There was a communication gap between the UGC and the university over the last date of sending the application, he said. The application was submitted early this year.

 CUs physics department has been getting UGC funds under the special assistance programme for the past 15 years.

 A key objective of the programme is to identify and support university departments that are capable of undertaking quality teaching and research. 

 The funds are provided under three categories. Departments chosen for the first phase are called departments of research support (DRS). After getting funds for three terms each of five years a department can apply for an upgrade to the level of department of special assistance (DSA). 

 In the third phase, a department is upgraded to the level of centre of advanced study (CAS).

 The rejection of the applications means that both departments already enjoying DSA status will have to start afresh from the DRS level.

 CAS is one of the most prestigious schemes under the UGCs funding projects, for which the authorities maintain a rigorous screening procedure, said an official.

 A CAS department gets as much as Rs 1 crore in five years. The funds under the DRS and DSA schemes vary from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 60 lakh.

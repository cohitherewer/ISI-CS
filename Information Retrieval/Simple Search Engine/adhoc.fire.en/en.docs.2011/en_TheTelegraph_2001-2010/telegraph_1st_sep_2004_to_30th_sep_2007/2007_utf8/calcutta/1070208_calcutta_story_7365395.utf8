The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Jagjit Singh

 You have a very kind, generous and loving nature. Your simplicity is charming and makes you likeable. Your style of work is very methodical; you are able to look at both minute details and the big picture. You are most productive when you have family support. Do not be disappointed in people if they are not as selfless as you are.

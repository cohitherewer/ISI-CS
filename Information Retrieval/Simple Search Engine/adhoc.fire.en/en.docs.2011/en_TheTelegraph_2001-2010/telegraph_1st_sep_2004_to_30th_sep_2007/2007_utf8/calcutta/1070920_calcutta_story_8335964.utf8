 Conductor targets girl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Class VIII girl and a woman in her early-30s bore the brunt of rogue conductors on Wednesday morning.

 Neha Sharma, of St Margarets School, was pushed off a moving private bus on Vivekananda Road as she pleaded with the conductor to stop the bus and allow her to get off. She was on her way to school to take an exam.

 Around the same time, 10.20am, the conductor of a minibus abused Dalia Dutta and forced her off the vehicle near Khanna cinema, when she demanded a ticket for the fare she had paid.

 Neha had boarded the bus, on route 215, near her home on Cotton Street. As it sped past YMCA, she requested the conductor to stop the bus so that she could get off. When the bus did not slow down, she shouted out to the driver to stop. 

 The conductor pulled me to the footboard and pushed me off the bus. I fell on the road and rolled over, injuring the right side of my head and my elbows, recounted the teenager, who still managed to note down the registration number of the bus.

 A woman in an autorickshaw helped Neha reach school, where the teachers alerted her parents. The girl broke down on seeing her mother Manju, who later said: I went to Amherst Street police station and lodged a complaint against the conductor. 

 Late on Wednesday officers at the police station said a hunt was on for the conductor. 

 The minibus conductor who harassed Dalia did not get away, thanks to prompt action by passengers. They handed over 22-year-old Bishnu Dev Singh to a traffic sergeant after he subjected Dalia to a volley of abuses and then forced her off the vehicle. 

 Dalia, who runs a sari boutique at her home on Ultadanga Main Road, had paid the fare soon after boarding the bus at Ultadanga.

 The conductor said he would give her the ticket later. He started abusing her when she asked for the ticket near Aurobindo Setu. Before getting off at Khanna, when Dalia demanded the ticket, Singh shouted at her and then pushed her off the bus.

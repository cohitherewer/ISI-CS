 Abstract imagery

 Beauty has an all-pervading presence in our lives. Yet, preoccupied with material pursuits, we find it difficult to see what lies before our very eyes. In imitating life, art captures that elusive grace and lays before us those simple joys and pleasures to which we had hitherto been oblivious. Bratati Mukherjees first solo exhibition of paintings seeks to crystallize the evanescent grace of the world and conquer and, perhaps, even transcend its savagery. Here, art functions in redeeming mankind; it depicts abstract, fantastic images to evoke emotions of tenderness and sensitivity in the minds of the viewer. Stimulating the depths of human thoughts and passions that lie beneath and beyond the surface of our conscious, purposeful beings, the paintings attempt to cleanse the invisible windows of perception and liberate the fetters of the mind, enabling us to touch infinity.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Bratati Mukherjee 

When: Till February 1, 3 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hot words, scuffle and herded off

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In the hotel 

 Raja Roychoudhury, from Krishnagar, was partying away on the last night of 2006 with two friends in the banquet room of a star hotel on Park Street, when he witnessed the face-off between a man who claimed to be a major in the Indian Army and a woman.

 On Thursday, he gave Metro a blow-by-blow account of the trouble (between Major Chandra Pratap Singh and a woman) that later triggered the vandalism at Park Street police station.

 It was around 11.30 pm when I, along with my friends, came out of the banquet room to meet another friend who was waiting downstairs. We saw a smart-looking young man exchanging angry words with a young woman in the lobby leading to the banquets. He seemed to be leaving, while she was on her way in.

 The woman was repeatedly shouting: You just pushed me and this is misbehaviour. You will have to say sorry because you have done it intentionally.

 But the man was not ready to apologise. He shouted back: It was not deliberate... I am a major in the Indian Army and I will not say sorry.

 The woman, in a black skirt and top, then asked the security personnel of the hotel to intervene. Immediately, a scuffle broke out. 

 The security personnel told the man to leave the place immediately, but he refused. He said he would not leave because he was authorised to be there till the end of the party.

 By then, the woman was nowhere to be seen. I saw some members of the hotel staff calling up someone and soon three policemen in uniform entered the place. 

 One of the cops, who looked like an officer, ordered the man to leave the place with him. But the man protested: Why should I go? I have the entry pass and I am entitled to be here.

 Suddenly, the officer pushed the man and a constable tried to slap him for misbehaving with his superior. They then almost dragged him away.

 We followed the policemen and saw them herd the man into a police jeep and drive off towards Park Street police station. We, too, started walking towards the thana.

 The police station was crowded. The man was sitting on a wooden bench and shouting at the policemen, demanding an explanation for his detention. He was sometimes speaking in Hindi, but mostly in fluent English. We then thought we had seen enough and returned to the hotel.

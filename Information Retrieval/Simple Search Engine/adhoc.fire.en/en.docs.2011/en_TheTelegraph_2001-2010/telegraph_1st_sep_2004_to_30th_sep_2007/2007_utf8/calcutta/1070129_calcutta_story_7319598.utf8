Surviving SRK, by Gauri

Screen On amp; Off

 Episode 4 of KBC saw contestant Vasu Jaitely, completely smitten by host SRK proposing marriage to King Khan. In Episode 5, Shah Rukh carries a letter from wife Gauri to rollover contestant Vasu, which he will read out on the Monday show at 9 pm.

 In the letter Gauri warns Vasu that if she does go on to marry Shah Rukh, what is in store for her. Yeh kab ghar aate hain, kab jaate hain, pata hi nahin chalta, she writes about the late hours SRK devotes to shooting everyday.

 Then she writes about Shah Rukhs favourite pastime spending hours in the bathroom. Kabhi kabhi lagta hai, itna bada ghar lene ki zaroorat hi nahin thi... Four-bathroom-hall-kitchen hi achha tha!

 Finally Gauri writes about how Shah Rukh would snatch the childrens toys and start playing with them, forget all the anniversaries in the family and some times even forget her name!

 Watch out for this hilarious love triangle on Monday, STAR Plus.

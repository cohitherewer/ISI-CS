FD 415 is poised to make dubious history by becoming the first address in Salt Lake to be reclaimed by the government for violation of the lease deed by being used for non-residential purposes.

 In a notice served by the urban development department, on behalf of the Governor of West Bengal, Haradhan Majumder has been warned that failure to remedy the breach of lease contract will force the government to re-enter into possession of the land.

 The address, opposite the Bidhannagar Municipality office, has an STD booth, a photocopying outlet and a stationery store. These commercial units are used by municipality officials and visitors.

 Majumder got the lease sanction for the plot on December 16, 1982. The deed clearly mentioned that the plot would be solely used for residential purposes and no other activity would be allowed without proper clearance from the government.

 I have received a notice from the Governor asking me to stop commercial activities at once, but there is no question of compliance, Majumder told Metro on Sunday.

 The combative 80-year-old added: I have a family to run. What will I do if I shut down the shops? If the municipality or the government tries to use force on this old man, I will have to take legal recourse.

 Things have come to a head with Majumder refusing to respond to notices served by the municipality. We have inspected the site and found some unauthorised construction for commercial activities. We have repeatedly notified him but he has paid no heed, said an official.

 We even threatened to slap a fine at the rate of Rs 100 per square metre of the floor area per month, but to no avail, added Tapas Chowdhury, executive engineer of the municipality.

 Action against Majumder could run into resistance. Why penalise the old man when so many big names are allowed to carry out commercial operations in residential areas? demanded a neighbour.

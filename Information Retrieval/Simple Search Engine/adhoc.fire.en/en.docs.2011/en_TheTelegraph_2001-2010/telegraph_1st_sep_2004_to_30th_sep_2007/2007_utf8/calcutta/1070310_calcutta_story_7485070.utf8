 Missing with crores

 - Small-time trader on CID most wanted list 

 KINSUK BASU

 Goutam Majumder was a suave man with impeccable manners, popular with everyone who knew him. So, when he went around seeking investment from his acquaintances with the promise of good returns, not many questions were asked.

 A year-and-a-half later, the 46-year-old from Bosepukur, in Kasba, is on the most wanted list of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). The allegation: He has gone missing with over Rs 2 crore that he took as loans from his acquaintances and banks.

 The victims include not only the well-heeled, but retired men who entrusted their lifes savings with him. Majumder also took a series of personal loans from private banks, where he knew the officials.

 According to police, the amount defalcated could cross Rs 3 crore.

 Majumder seems to have cheated a number of people over months after winning their confidence by providing good returns initially. As the word spread and more people started depositing money with him, he became greedy and disappeared with a large amount in September 2006, said inspector-general of police (CID) D.P. Tarenia.

 Majumder ran a small beauty parlour, apart from some stalls, before he started seeking investments from people. His first client was Shom Shankar Banerjee of Dhakuria, from whom he used to take computer lessons.

 Majumder used to visit our house often and was on excellent terms with my family members. He offered to pay interest at the rate of three per cent per month if we invested money with him. For the first six months, he paid the interest on time. Then he asked for more money. We trusted him, only to lose our lifes savings, recounted Pralay, Shoms father.

 Majumder allegedly cheated the Banerjees of nearly Rs 7 lakh. Others lost between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 9 lakh. Majumder has admitted his son to a good school and even bought a car, claimed a man who had invested money with him.

 There were times he failed to pay the interest, but he would return after a few months with a huge sum of money. From January 2006, he became irregular with his payments. By that time, he had convinced us to take bank loans and invest the money with him, said Nabarun Mahalanabis, who also invested with Majumder. 

 About 15 people have complained against Majumder at Kasba police station. The CID has recently taken over the case.

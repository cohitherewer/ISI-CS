 Drainage stations on cards

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will set up two new drainage pumping stations at Marcus Square and Gokhale Road to solve the waterlogging problem in the areas. The work will start in the first week of June.

 The project was finalised at a meeting of civic engineers and officials on Friday. 

 We have given the contract to McKintosh Burn. I hope the stations will be ready by monsoon 2008. The CMC will invest around Rs 7.5 crore for the project, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. 

 With the addition of these two stations, the number of pumping stations in the city will become 20. The combined draining-out capacity will go up by 30 cusecs or 6.72 lakh gallons per hour.

 The pumping station on Gokhale Road will improve the waterlogging situation on and around Harish Mukherjee Road, Elgin Road and Sambhunath Pandit Street. Parts of Chowringhee and AJC Bose Road will also benefit. 

 The pumping station at Marcus Square will solve the prolonged waterlogging problem on Muktarambabu Street, Rajen De Road, MM Burman Street and parts of MG Road, Chittaranjan Avenue and Bidhan Sarani.

 After last monsoon, the civic body had for the first time constituted a technical team headed by chief engineer (project and development) Nilangshu Bose and chief engineer P.K. Dhua to assess the waterlogging situation in the city. Following the teams report, the projects at Marcus Square and Gokhale Road were taken up. 

 The team had also called for a bypass sewer line under the western pavement of Bidhan Sarani to solve the waterlogging problem in and around Mecchua, MM Burman Street, Kalabagan, Mahajati Sadan and Ram Mandir.

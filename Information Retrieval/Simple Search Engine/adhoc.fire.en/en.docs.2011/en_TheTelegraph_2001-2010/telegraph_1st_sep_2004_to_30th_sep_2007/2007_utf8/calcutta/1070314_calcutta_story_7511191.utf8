 Air foul amp; fair: 

 A private bus emitting fumes on a city street. (Above) 

 A new CNG-run bus in Delhi 

 Apropos the report Held for drunken 

 joyride, February 8, the mishap near Nazrul Mancha in which 

 five intoxicated Class XI students of a reputed south Calcutta 

 school rammed into three college girls is another instance 

 of juvenile delinquency. 

 The fact that Utsav Dutta was driving the car at over 70 km per hour is proof of growing indiscipline among youngsters and their propensity to lead fast lives. This is a matter of serious concern as thousands of teenagers do not think twice about breaking the law when they should be concentrating on studies and building a career. 

 The fact that Utsav has a driving licence raises questions about the system of issuing licences. The people who grant licences without proper safeguards must be punished heavily. Police seem to come into the picture only after such mishaps occur, not beforehand. The youngster should have been stopped before he hit the girls. 

 The legislations also need to be strengthened to deal with such mishaps more firmly. 

 Jayantabishnu Mukherjee,

 Address not given. 

 Apropos the report Buddha eye on CNG, February 7, it is good that the state government is taking an initiative to control pollution by introducing CNG in Calcutta. But at the same time, it is looking the other way on the issue of banning old buses that discharge a huge amount of polluting fumes. Many are suffering from diseases like asthma due to the plying of such buses in the city. The introduction of CNG will not have much of an effect on pollution, unless the old buses are taken off the road. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report A school in police station, February 1, Anil Jana, an officer of Calcutta Police, is doing a splendid job for streetchildren. Such efforts should be lauded and encouraged. If more policemen take up such work, peoples perception of the force will change totally. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge. 

 Apropos the report Motorcycle mishap fatal, February 5, it is a matter of concern that fatalities on the road are on the rise. The vigilance by traffic police needs to be strengthened. What has not helped is the easy availability of powerful vehicles. Their advertisements, too, influence impressionable youngsters to drive fast, resulting in accidents.The government must lay down guidelines to curb such advertisements. 

 A.S. Mehta,

 New Alipore.

 Despite hue and cry after every 

 road mishap and hundreds of newspaper reports, nothing seems 

 to be done to make the city streets safer. Even guardians 

 seem least bothered about the safety of their children, 

 who are often seen riding pillion without helmets. Police 

 must take strong action against traffic rule violators to 

 bring down the number of accidents. 

 Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos the column Mystery of the missed viewer, February 4, gone are the days when the viewers would silently bear with the highhandedness of the broadcasters. Television channels now cannot further their interests by inconveniencing viewers. Numerous competitors are waiting in the wings to lure the audience away. 

 Avinash Gupta, 

 Bandel. 

 It was wonderful to find out about a 97-year-old cricketer who had represented the Indians against a touring MCC team led by Douglas Jardine, who is considered one of the best captains the game has seen. I wish Ardhendu Bhashi Das a long and peaceful life. 

 Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos the report A batsman 

 and a gentleman, February 8, kudos for making the public 

 aware of a forgotten hero. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata. 

 Apropos the report Locked in, to toil and die, February 8, it is shocking that seven labourers of an illegal sari factory on Bon Behari Bose Road were burnt alive in a blaze. No words are strong enough to condemn the owners of these illegal sweatshops. The labourers are forced to live in the units amid inflammable items and work very long hours. The governments laidback attitude in this regard defies logic. Surprisingly, the residents of the area where these factories have sprung up have not tried to shut them down. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road. 

 Apropos the report 30 ill after meal in school, February 7, it is unfortunate that students fell ill after having their midday meal at a school on Eliot Road. The matter should be investigated and action taken against those responsible. Reports of students falling ill after having midday meal in rural schools is quite common. Finding cooks and maintaining the quality of food served are persistent problems. That can be solved if dry food is served to students. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala.

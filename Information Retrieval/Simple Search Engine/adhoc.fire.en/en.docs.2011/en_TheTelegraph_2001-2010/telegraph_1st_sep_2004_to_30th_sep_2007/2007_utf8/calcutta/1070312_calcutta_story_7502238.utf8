 Telescope at college

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 In an attempt to provide community service, Kalyani Government Engineering College has set up an astronomical observatory.

 The observatory, built as part of the Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP), funded by the World Bank, was inaugurated on February 23.

 The primary reason behind setting up the observatory is to allow people to understand the sky better and get rid of superstitions, said head of the physics department of the college Sisir Kumar Bose. He is also chairman of the Committee for Services to the Community and Economy, under TEQIP.

 According to him, the observatory will educate people on the science behind all astronomical phenomena. Most people do not have a clear concept about astronomy. The availability of the observatory will help build a scientific temper, added Bose.

 The observatory, built over three years, has a revolving dome with a 10-inch Newtonian reflective telescope. The telescope will allow people an extended view of astronomical objects, without disruptions due to the rotation of the earth, added Bose.

 The technical branch of the state higher education department had initially provided a Rs 1.10-lakh grant to the college for buying the telescope. 

 The construction of the observatory, later, became part of the World Bank project.

 We have utilised about Rs 2 lakh from the Rs 12-lakh grant we received from the World Bank for the first phase of the construction of the observatory, stated Bose.

 St Xaviers College and Presidency College have their own astronomical observatories. However, the facility at St Xaviers has become defunct, while the Presidency observatory requires an upgrade.

 The observatory will not only help the common people, but will motivate engineering students in developing an interest in astronomy. It can also be used for research, said Debiprosad Duari, director (research and academics) of MP Birla Planetarium. He inaugurated the observatory at the Kalyani college.

 The college authorities also have plans to start courses in astronomy and astrophysics.

 Wanted Bangla trio held 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Three Bangladeshi criminals were arrested in Garfa on Wednesday on charges of entering and staying in India without valid papers.

 All three Lombu Selim, alias Biplab Rehaman, Babloo and Rafique figure on the most-wanted list of the Bangladeshi government. 

 They are associates of Joy, who has several cases pending against him in Bangladesh. Joy was recently arrested in Rajarhat.

 Joy had extorted crores from several Bangladeshi businessmen, said a senior officer of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

 The three youths arrested on Wednesday had allegedly entered India through the North 24-Parganas border a year ago. They were desperately looking for Indian ration cards, the officer added.

 A probe revealed that the three had rented a house in Garfa, close to the SD4 bus stand, posing as businessmen from Bangladesh. They changed houses several times to avoid the suspicion of local residents.

 The three have been charged in several cases of dacoity, extortion and murder in Bangladesh. Selim was arrested in Bongaon a few months ago. But he was soon out on bail, as the police failed to ascertain his identity. He was arrested for helping a local gang, said an officer of the CID.

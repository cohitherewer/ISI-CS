 Spurned suitor rips girl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 22-year-old student of a New Alipore college slashed the neck and abdomen of a classmate after she turned down his proposal for marriage on Tuesday evening.

 The girl, bleeding profusely, was taken to a private hospital in the area and later shifted to SSKM Hospital, where she was administered more than a dozen stitches.

 Subhajit Senco was arrested following a complaint lodged by the girls father and charged with attempt to murder. A city court on Wednesday remanded him in judicial custody till September 5.

 The incident occurred around 5.30pm on Bramho Bandhab Upadhayay Sarani, in New Alipores M Block, around 200 yards from the college. The two were walking towards New Alipore station, on their way home in Akra-Santoshpur.

 It seems Subhajit wanted to marry the girl, an English (honours) student, on Tuesday. He lost his head when the girl turned down his proposal and slashed her neck and abdomen with a blade. Later, he cut his hands with the same blade, said an officer of New Alipore police station.

 Local residents, alerted by the girls cries, caught hold of the youth and informed the police. The college authorities and the students union refused to comment on the incident, as it did not occur on campus.

 But some of Subhajits friends said the youth looked possessed when he met them on Tuesday morning and expressed his determination to marry the girl.

 We saw the two discuss something animatedly. A few minutes later, Subhajit walked up to us and asked for Rs 500, saying he was going to marry the girl, said one of his friends. He claimed that he earns enough as an agent of a life insurance company to support a family.

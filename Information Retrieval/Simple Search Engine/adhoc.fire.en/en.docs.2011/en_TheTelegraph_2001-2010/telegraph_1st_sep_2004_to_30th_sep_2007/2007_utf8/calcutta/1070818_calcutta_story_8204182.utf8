 10-year RI for fatal assault

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Alipore court on Friday sentenced three men convicted in the Biswarup Roy Choudhury murder case to 10 years rigorous imprisonment (RI).

 The convicts Paresh Mukherjee, Notan Talukdar and Kochi Haldar will also have to pay a fine of Rs 2,000 each and spend a year in jail for assaulting the wife and son of the victim. 

 The prison terms will run concurrently, said the judge, Suryendu Biswas.

 Roy Choudhury, the owner of an eatery on Lake View Road, called Pink Giraffe, died on Saptami night, 2004, after being assaulted by the convicts over a dispute over vacating the restaurant premises.

 Mukherjee, the landlord of the building in which the eatery was housed, and his two accomplices beat up Roy Choudhury, and his wife and son. Roy Choudhury succumbed to his injuries the same night. The trio was arrested the next day. 

 While convicting the three on Thursday, the judge had said: This is case of culpable homicide. The accused had assaulted the victim but had no intention to kill him.

 The lawyer appearing for the convicts said his clients would move an appeal in the high court. He said he would also seek bail for them. 

 According to the case report, Mukherjee had repeatedly asked Roy Choudhury to vacate the premises, as the three-year contract was over. But the eatery owner refused to do so. He, instead, demanded compensation for the damage caused to his eatery, which he attributed to Mukherjees negligence.

 Rajarshee, the victims son and main witness to the assault, deposed in court on Thursday.

 Tips to good tennis parenting

 - Club embarks on ambitious grooming programme with booklet to sensitise families of its trainees

 A STAFF REPORTER

 How will we find the next Leander Paes? Served this question, South Club has volleyed an answer first find the next Vece Paes. Acknowledging the role played by tennis parents, the Woodburn Park club, where Premjit Lal, Jaidip Mukerjea, Akhtar Ali, his son Zeeshan, and Leander honed their skills, has embarked on an ambitious Tennis Development Programme. 

 We are trying to make our tennis training programme more comprehensive, said club president Rajat Majumder. The first step in that direction is a move to sensitise parents of tennis trainees to the needs of their wards.

 A 54-page booklet, Being a Better Tennis Parent Guidelines to help parents of young tennis players, compiled by Majumder, was distributed at a seminar at the club on Friday. Sports medicine experts, physiologists, fitness trainers and psychologists from Sports Authority of India and National Institute of Behavioural Sciences were at hand to answer queries. Chief coach of the club Akhtar Ali was also present.

 Be a good parent to be a good tennis parent was the panels message. Parents expecting high returns for money and time spent on their childrens tennis training actually hinder their development, said Majumder. Parents are either completely uninvolved or over-involved.

 Ali cited the case of Vijay Amritraj, written off early in his career because he was asthmatic. Similarly, Ramesh Krishnan was thought to be too fat and short for tennis. Ali asked parents to be patient and not intervene too much.

 Tennis has evolved a great deal and the old training systems have become obsolete. In Germany, the potential of four-year-olds is being gauged by computers. Back in the 70s, a scientist had predicted that a four-year-old would become a great serve-and-volley player. The kid was Boris Becker, said Majumder. It is this scientific approach to the game that he wants to usher in. 

 Ali will run the programme with the help of a team of professional coaches certified by the Indian Tennis Federation. Biomechanics experts and specialists from the Bengal Tennis Association will also chip in. Height, weight, body fat, speed, endurance, agility, strength, flexibility and mental aspects of the trainees will be monitored, said Majumder. There will be lessons to develop motor skills. Even muscle biopsy might be carried out to spot talent, according to the club president. 

 Each tennis player has his own style. For example, Nadal has power, while Federer has a greater range of strokes. Each child needs to be trained according to his or her potential, said Ali.

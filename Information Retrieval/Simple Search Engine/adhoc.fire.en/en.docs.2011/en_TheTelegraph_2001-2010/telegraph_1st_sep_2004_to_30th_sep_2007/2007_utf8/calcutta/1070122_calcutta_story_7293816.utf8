The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 KBC 

 is my next big entertainer

 Screen On amp; Off

 Pratim D. Gupta puts SHAH RUKH 

 KHAN in the hot seat hours before the King Khan invades our 

 homes and lives

 Now that you have shot a few episodes of KBC, does 

 the chair fit the King?

 It is a little high and big for 

 me but I am hoping that whatever I have done I will be able 

 to entertain people through it. See, I am an entertainer 

 and I am giving my best shot. I have finished my initial 

 work. Some of the episodes were really funny and nice. Everyone 

 said its good. But then again, after every film, everyone 

 says its good. Finally whos going to decide? The people 

 who will watch it. I am hoping my best effort is appreciated. 

 If its not, then I will try harder and make it better.

 Obviously, the inherent aspect 

 of the whole show is the game itself, which is very exciting. 

 A lot of the show depends on the people sitting and answering 

 questions on what they say and how. I am trying to take 

 the show forward without making it my show. The show is 

 about the people. I have to be there without disturbing 

 them or troubling their concentration, by joking with them, 

 trying to make them feel easy. They must have a good time 

 and win lots of money. 

 You are hosting a TV show for the first time. Is it more 

 exciting than speaking the scripted lines of a movie?

 I think hosting comes a bit naturally 

 to me because even during my stage shows I do this live 

 interaction with people I dont know at all. I do a little 

 dance with them, talk to them, make them have a good time. 

 My theatre background helps me with that. I am very fond 

 of talking to people, finding out what is good and bad in 

 their lives and helping them out. These are sides of me 

 people do not normally get to see. All they see are characters 

 played by me in films. I am a sociable kind of a person. 

 I have a sense of humour and I am young enough for people 

 to be a little informal with me. Thats what I bring to 

 the table as a person who is hosting the show.

 Freeze kiya jaye? The many 

 moods of Shah Rukh Khan as the host of Kaun Banega 

 Crorepati, which starts on Monday at 9 pm, on STAR 

 Plus

 So, are you being yourself or are you playing Shah Rukh 

 Khan?

 I am trying my best to be myself. 

 But to be really honest, somewhere down the line, a bit 

 of acting does come in. I am trying to lose that as I go 

 along. The first few episodes may be a little jagged because 

 of that. But I am trying to make it as real as possible. 

 I think I am 95 to 97 per cent there with the first five 

 episodes. And Inshallah as I go along I hope I will 

 be 100 per cent me.

 We all heard about your rehearsals. Did you watch the original 

 shows and Mr Bachchans shows again?

 Theres a lot of talk about it 

 but the reality is, everything that we do, we do rehearse. 

 It was done at my place strictly because of convenience. 

 We prepared everything. You have to, because you are presenting 

 something to people who are expecting to see a good thing. 

 In terms of a model, I have seen 

 the English shows... I have seen the Indian show with Mr 

 Bachchan in it, of course. I have just seen them to see 

 the technical part of the show. Everything from which question 

 comes, how it all flows through... The sound and the lighting 

 on the show are all computerised, it goes completely like 

 clockwork according to my talking, my commands. Now, I cant 

 mess up on that. I wanted to practise so much that it became 

 like second nature. Only then can I be free, have fun and 

 enjoy the show with everyone. 

 How would you review your performance vis-a-vis all the 

 other hosts you have seen?

 I think I bring a lot of humour 

 into the show. Incidentally, the first few reviews of the 

 original Who Wants To Be A Millionaire did actually 

 say that it is one of the funniest shows on television. 

 I read a few books written on the show and spoke to people 

 who have seen these shows. I have also done this huge music 

 video for it. Through the video I am telling people that 

 I am bringing to the show a lot of fun and a bit of irreverence. 

 But still, the essence is ask the question because only 

 then can you get the right answer which will change your 

 life.

 What about the new phrases you are bringing into play?

 When we were rehearsing, once 

 we were playing with the kids and I said kachchakachcha 

 ya pakka-pakka, Siddhartha (Basu) and his 

 team at Synergy said: This sounded damn good Shah Rukh. 

 Lets try this on the show a little. So, during the rehearsals 

 some words came out like freeze it (for locking the answer) 

 or alag palat for Flip the question or Ladies 

 and gentlemen, boys and girls Theres also a line I kept 

 saying before going to the break Main aapka intezaar 

 karoonga.

 When someone tunes in to your show, which is called KBC 

 and not KBC 3, is he supposed to blank out the previous 

 two seasons from his mind?

 We are strangely unsecular about 

 cultural activities because we analyse them. But people 

 who just watch them, they watch it with only one aspect 

 in mind. Did I enjoy this or not? It is as simple as that. 

 We complicate the issues. Entertainment ki memory 

 bahut short hoti hai aur woh khatam ho jayegi. 

 Yes, analysts, critics, me, you will take a few months to 

 get over this. 

 Am I trying to erase the memory 

 of the old KBC? No. I, as a matter of fact, will 

 do exactly what the old KBC did and that is to entertain 

 people. Of course, we will put our best foot forward. There 

 will be this grand video at the start, a lot of dancing, 

 singing, the colour of the set has been changed... But all 

 these are just peripherals. What will matter is the good 

 story we are trying to tell which will hold the interest 

 of the audience.

 So in many ways KBC is your next big movie...

 KBC is my next big entertainer.

 And is there some pressure to deliver, some pressure to 

 live up to the expectations?

 Yeah, yeah, I wont lie. Like 

 any big film of mine, which comes out and is sometimes torn 

 apart and sometimes appreciated Yes, I am pressurised. 

 I am anxious. I am worried. I am waiting. I also know that 

 once the hoardings come out of a movie, I have no control 

 over it. I wish I had more control. I wish I could clone 

 everybody who likes me and tell them to love me.

 Are you still happy with your decision to take up KBC?

 Yes, I am thrilled with the decision 

 of being able to meet people, to entertain them. I am also 

 thrilled with the fact that at an age and stage where I 

 can take it very easy in my life and be in the comfort zone, 

 I still have the guts to take on something which is such 

 a high-risk opportunity as KBC. I know the risk involved. 

 I have done it with Baazigar, I have done it with 

 Darr, I have done it with loads of things and I am 

 glad I am able to do it once more all over again with KBC. 

 I am very proud of myself. I will be prouder if I am able 

 to pull it off. I am glad I have not lost the edge to take 

 on things which challenge me. My children will be proud 

 of me. I am a good or bad actor, all that is not important. 

 But do I have the guts to try something new? I think, I 

 have.

 Your son Aryan used to call Mr Bachchan Crorepati Uncle. 

 What is he calling you now?

 He calls me Papa. He always will, 

 I hope. I hope that my brand is not better known at home 

 than the fact that I am his father. I hope I am always their 

 father and that they dont mind whether their father slips 

 or becomes bigger.

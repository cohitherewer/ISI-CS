 Traders in the College Street market started shifting to their temporary stalls in Marcus Square on Friday to make way for the construction of a nine-storeyed commercial complex.

 Following an order from the high court, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has arranged for all basic amenities, including electricity, at the new site.

 Demolition of the market started during the day.

 The traders were shifting their articles on their own, but there was discontent over the choice of the temporary relocation venue.

 Do you think we will get business there? One smart shower will flood the entire place, said Biswabrata Ghosh, a garment trader whose shop is more than 55 years old. Besides, we have to pay for the shifting twice now, as well as while coming back.

 Joint civic commissioner Sahidul Islam said if redevelopment work proceeds smoothly, the traders would be brought back within 18 months.

 There was, however, a difference of opinion over the number of traders in the market. While Dinesh Jaiswal, of the College Street Market Dealers Association, claimed the traders number 1,254, a civic official said there are altogether 970 traders. 

 Of them, 404 do not have any stalls, he pointed out. However, alternative arrangements, will be made for them.

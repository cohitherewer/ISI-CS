 Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi sees a crisis in the quality of education. A Telegraph picture

 Students no longer trust their teachers; nor do teachers have any faith in their students. A crisis of confidence, as summed up by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, has been plaguing the countrys education system, and it needs to be resolved at the earliest.

 Gandhi made the statement while addressing a programme organised by Calcutta University on the College Street campus, to mark the end of its post-centenary golden jubilee celebration.

 The Governor, also chancellor of the university, urged the authorities to take immediate steps to restore the trust, as the crisis could downgrade the quality of education.

 I have heard teachers telling me about the way they experience the fluctuations of the mood and temper among students nowadays. At the same time, students also complain that they often find it difficult to communicate with their teachers, as they are busy with other work most of the time, Gandhi observed.

 According to him, teachers and students are making such complaints, as they no longer trust each other. Something has to be done to overcome this crisis.

 The governor did not just identify the problem; he also offered a solution. Efficient and devoted teachers, he feels, are the need of the hour. 

 He suggested that good teachers be reappointed after their retirement. In my opinion, it is a waste of intellect if experienced teachers are allowed to go into oblivion after retirement, Gandhi said.

 Retired teachers can play a big role in enriching the knowledge of students in the respective fields in which they are pursuing their studies, he added. But the lectures to be delivered by the retired teachers should be different from the conventional kind and more informative.

 Gandhi also suggested that the university take steps, like approaching former students, to raise extra funds to pay the retired teachers.

 Referring to a statement by vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee, who compared the 150-year-old university to a banyan tree, the governor pointed out: There is also another banyan tree in the city, in the Botanical Garden. The banyan tree there is more than 200 years old, but we do not celebrate its birthday.

 He stressed that unless the situation changes for the better, this banyan tree (the university) will not be different than the other one (in Botanical Garden).

 Later, Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) said the university will soon examine the governors proposal and contact former students, settled both in India and abroad, for financial help for the remuneration of retired teachers being reappointed by the university.

 University Grants Commission chairman Sukhadeo Thorat and Pratap Chandra Chunder, academician and former Union education minister, were present at the programme.

 After scaling the seven highest peaks in seven continents in record time, IIT and IIM alumnus Malli Mastan Babu has taken the first step towards using treks and expeditions to offer leadership training to corporate executives. 

 The 33-year-old recently led an expedition to Uhuru (Mount Kilimanjaro), the highest peak in Africa, with executives from India. Uhuru in Swahili means freedom. Our aim was to reach the summit on the 60th anniversary of Independence, said Malli.

 The team comprised K. Jayshanker of Empowered Learning Systems from Pune, Ulhas Deshpande, the COO of Adventity from Mumbai, Umar Teekay, the managing director of Teekays Interior Solutions from Bangalore and P. Shreekanth, the IT security in-charge of Centurion Bank from Mumbai.

 They started the climb on August 10 and reached the summit on the morning of August 15. The team descended two days later. 

 With this climb, Malli became the first Indian to summit the mountain thrice and Shreekanth, who has polio in his right hand, became the first disabled person from India to make it to the top of Uhuru.

 While Malli oversaw the mountaineering matters, Jayshanker looked after leadership and personality development. He gave us case studies. We interacted and analysed to understand how the days activities were educative, said Malli.We wanted to design an expedition where the participants had to stretch themselves to achieve goals. We also wanted to relate the experiences to work, said Jayshanker.

 The climb was a life-changing experience for the team-members. This was one training where we had to face real-life situations that require problem solving, determination, will power, patience and teamwork, all of which are very relevant to corporate life, said Deshpande.

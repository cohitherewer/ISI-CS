 Hitmen trapped in Patna

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two fugitive hitmen, accused of pulling the trigger on Howrah businessman Kishanlal Jain, fell into the police net in Patna on Tuesday. 

 We had the duos cellphone numbers and we were tracking their movement. As we were sure that the duo was in Patna, we alerted our counterparts and they were arrested, said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general of police (operations), CID.

 A CID team will leave for Patna shortly to bring the duo to Calcutta.

 On January 23, Amit and Chandan on a motorcycle intercepted Jain a businessman dealing in iron scrap as he was returning home on his scooter. They pumped three bullets into his head and chest. He died on way to hospital.

 The daylight murder of Jain on JN Mukherjee Road in Malipanchghora police station area of Howrah shook the locality and the sleuths were under pressure to catch the killers.

 The recent arrest of three persons, who had provided the duo with a motorcycle, gave the sleuths some key leads in the case.

 Investigators learnt that Amit Chowdhury, who controls the iron-scrap auction business across the country, paid Rs 50,000 to the duo to eliminate Jain, a business rival. 

 After the operation in Howrah, they went to Bhadrak in Orissa and committed another crime, said a CID official.

 Of structures and dimensions

 One of the foremost contemporary researchers in the realm of sculpture, Gopal Prasad Mandal uses his imagination to deconstruct the imitative element in art. Experimenting with almost every medium and playing with forms in an uninhibited way, his art illuminates his quest to explore and discover strange, uncharted areas through which he can express his creative fantasies. An artist much ahead of his time, his art is quintessentially eclectic. To him, the root of any artistic expression lies in the atom of life; whether it is a tiny seed or a gigantic tree, the human body or a divine icon. His knowledge of realism allows him the freedom to travel into the world of the non-formal and the make-believe in his works. In Search of Micro to Macro Organic Sculptures, the ongoing exhibition of his works, features sculptures in bronze, marble, brass, wood and terracotta, representing the sculptors amazing control over forms, shapes and dimensions.

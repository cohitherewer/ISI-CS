 Todi surfaces for sleuths

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Six days after Rizwanur Rahman was found dead, his father-in-law Ashok Todi appeared at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) headquarters for prolonged questioning.

 Todi entered Bhabani Bhavan at 3.40pm on Tuesday and emerged at 6.50pm after giving sleuths a detailed account of what had happened since he came to know of daughter Priyankas registry marriage with Rizwanur. He mentioned the names of all the police officers he had met for assistance.

 After recording Todis statement, Bhupinder Singh, the additional director-general CID, echoed what chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said at Writers Buildings earlier that no officer would be shielded.

 We have taken his statement and will cross-check it with whatever he had told others on previous occasions. We will talk to all those who got involved in this case, including police officers, said Singh, overseeing the probe into the mysterious death of Rizwanur on September 21.

 Where was Priyanka? CID officials said she was traumatised and so, had stayed away. But we will definitely question her as soon as possible, said Singh.

 The CID had told Todi to appear for questioning at Bhabani Bhavan on Thursday.

 Just after 3.30pm, a steel-grey Chevrolet Tavera (WB02 X3621) came to a halt in front of the CID headquarters. Todi, in a white shirt and black trousers, stepped out, along with one of his employees and two lawyers.

Sleuths waiting in front of the main entrance whisked him away to the office of Niraj Narayan Pandey, the deputy inspector-general (CID).

 He told us that he fell ill on September 7 and was admitted to a private hospital. We will check the records of the hospital, Singh later said.

 Todi also mentioned that the written agreement between his relative Anil Saraogi and Rizwanur with the assurance that Priyanka would return to her husband after seven days was flouted because of family problems.

 Earlier in the day, CID officials visited Rizwanurs Tiljala Lane house and spoke to his family members.

 They asked for a copy of a the marriage certificate of Rizwanur and Priyanka. They also took away some photographs of Priyanka and Rizwanur. Then they asked us in detail what had happened the day Ashok Todi had come here to take his daughter home, said Rukbanur, Rizwanurs brother.

 Sleuths on Thursday also questioned Sadique Hussain, one of the witnesses in the marriage of Rizwanur and Priyanka. Sadique told CID officials how some officers of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad had threatened him after he refused to give a false statement that Rizwanur an ex-student of St Xaviers College (1999 batch) had married Priyanka against her wishes.

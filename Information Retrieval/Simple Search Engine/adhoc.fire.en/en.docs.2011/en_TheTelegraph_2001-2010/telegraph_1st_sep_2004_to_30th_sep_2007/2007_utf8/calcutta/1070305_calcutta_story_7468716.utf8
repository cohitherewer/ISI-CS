 The foundation stone of an innovative information technology (IT) park, Ecospace, was laid in Action Area II of Rajarhat on Sunday morning by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee.

 The joint initiative of Ambuja Realty and Bangalore-based RMZ Corp is coming up on 20 acres, owned in equal measures by the partners, and is scheduled to be ready in 30 months.

 Keeping in mind the need for protecting the environment, we have decided to keep open 63 per cent of the land, which will be extensively landscaped, said Harshvardhan Neotia, of Ambuja Realty. 

 The technology park will cover eight state-of-the-art IT towers of eight floors each, to come up on a built-up area of 2.06 million sq ft.

 To support 24x7 operations, the park will also have a gymnasium, speciality restaurants and incubation centres.

 The state has become a key destination for global IT players who are making big investments here. This gives rise to the need for proper infrastructure where these firms will operate from, said Neotia. With Salt Lake Sector V reaching saturation point, Rajarhat is going to be the new IT hub.

 About Ecospace, Neotia stressed that it is not a joint venture, but a joint initiative of Ambuja Realty and RMZ Corp, which own 10 acres each. RMZ will provide the master plan and execute the project on behalf of Ambuja Realty.

 RMZ Corp, which has built over seven million sq ft of office space for companies like Accenture, Shell, Airbus, Reuters and Google, has bigger plans for Calcutta.

 We plan to develop more than 50 million sq ft of corporate, retail and hospitality space in the next five years. On our agenda is setting up one hotel each in Calcutta and Rajarhat. The announcements are likely to be made in the second quarter (of the next fiscal), said RMZ Corp managing director Raj Menda.

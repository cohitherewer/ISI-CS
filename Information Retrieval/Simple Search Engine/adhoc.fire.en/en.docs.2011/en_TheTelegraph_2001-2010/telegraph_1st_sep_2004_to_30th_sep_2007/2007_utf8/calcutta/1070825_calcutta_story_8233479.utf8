 CID scan on Bypass land deals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state land and land reforms department has sought a CID probe into illegal deals related to 89 acres of vested land off EM Bypass.

 Land and land reforms commissioner P.K. Agarwal has written to Bhupinder Singh, the additional director-general of CID, asking him to take up the matter.

 Six people have lodged FIRs with Jadavpur (East) police station, alleging that they have been duped into buying government plots off the Bypass, where a realty boom has been pushing up land prices.

 The FIRs followed the arrest of Gobinda Haldar on July 27, on charges of fencing off a part of the vested land and trying to pass it off as private property. A probe revealed that Haldar had sold off the land to several people, and even same plots to different people.

 The government suspects that several other people are involved in the racket. 

 One of the complainants, Sambhunath Adhya, alleged that he had paid Rs 96 lakh for a plot that he later came to know was owned by the government.

 In its complaint to the CID, the land reforms department has also referred to the case of Shantiniketan Cooperative Society, which has built a housing estate on a part of the vested land. The land reforms department is planning to build an office there to prove that it owns the plot.

 More such cases have come to our notice. We dont want people to be duped into buying government land, said Agarwal.

 Words are all he has

 Gulzar at The Park last Saturday. Picture by Aranya Sen 

 Whatever you write will be picturised like Beedi or Kajra Re. As Gulzar pauses, one tries to follow his vacant gaze through the thick bifocal lenses getting caught in the confines of the hotel room. Is it sadness or anger? 

 Where is the quality of the films made by Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha, Bimal Roy? That literature Jarasandhs Bandini, Ashapurna Devis Sujata...? Lyrics have to be a part of the same film. You are bound with the situation, with the character, with the language of the character the wizard with words had launched a verbal volley before lapsing into that pregnant pause. 

 But Gulzar also takes pride in the positives that Indian cinema has achieved Look at the polish of the films; we are in the mainstream of the world today. Plus, he has taken up the challenge to rise above the constraints while sticking to a films idiom. 

 Take this underworld man (in Satya). He says, Dont tell me to think. Its the thinking that creates problems. The character shooting around cant sing Dil e nadan tujhe huya kya hai. He cant sing Ghalib. He will sing Goli maar bheje mein, bheja shor karta hai.

 So after Aanewala pal jaanewala hai, Tujhse naraaz nahin zindagi and Mera kuchh saamaan... Gulzars pen today is guided by self-imposed principles: Dont be vulgar, dont be two-meaning, dont lose your aesthetics. And the pop awards still stream in. With Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, Just Married (daughter Meghnas next project) and Blue Umbrella lined up for release in 2007, the run promises to continue.

 The lyricist still takes heart from a chance to work with a Mani Ratnam. You hardly get directors who ask for abstract imagery. Gurus imagery is so beautiful. Another person he thanks is Aishwarya Rai, for her on-screen innocence in the film.

 He will have no finger-pointing for what is happening around him. If Hindi films have come to this, what have the directors come to? It (Beedi) is the same Vishal (Bhardwaj) with whom I worked in Maqbool, it (Kajra re) is the same Shaad (Ali) with whom I worked in Saathiya. Only the film is changing and I have to walk along with them. That is the challenge.

 The listening experience, Gulzar points out, is changing from drawing room to the dance floors. In Omkara, theres O saathi re very beautiful melody, a thumri-style song by Rahat Naina, and there is Beedi. Vishal gave a beautiful range. Given all this on a platter, if you pick up only Beedi thats your choice. In Bunty Aur Babli, Chup chup ke is one of the finest melodies of Shankar. They picked up Kajra re, the Padmabhushan awardee shrugs.

 As he nears his 72nd birthday, Gulzar still loves to play to children. Lakdi ki kaathi (Masoom) is one of the most popular songs of children. Then, Chaddi pehen ke phool khila hai (for DDs Jungle Book) it goes with the imagery of Mowgli. 

 He is now coming out with a complete album of limericks. It is a beautiful form. Take Ha Ja Ba Ra La. Sukumar Ray is genius of a poet. Machchhar malarui, the first poem of my collection, will be like that. Its on a mosquito which flies about whistling like a loafer. I try to kill him and he thinks I am clapping and starts dancing. There will also be a collection of short stories from him this year. I would also like to do something with the longer poems of Tagore.

 But what Gulzar takes the most satisfaction in is the release of Koi Baat Chale. The album, which brings him together with Jagjit Singh seven years after Marasim, has seen a three-lined form of poetry he has invented finding musical expression for the first time. The third line changes the meaning of the first two lines which seemed complete by themselves. I named it triveni. Like at the sangam in Allahabad, Ganga and Jamuna are the two apparent colours of the water, the gupt one is Saraswati; after the first two lines if you can show a Saraswati, it becomes a triveni. Gulzar feels very few composers can work on words, that too for a ghazal. This is where Jagjit is a master. In India I dont see anybody else doing it with such expertise.

 The conversation has been long. Gulzar picks up the booklet of lyrics of the album. The room resonates as he recites: Humko Ghalib ne yeh dua di thi/Tum salamat raho hazaar baras/Lekin yeh baras to dinon mein gaya! A triveni.

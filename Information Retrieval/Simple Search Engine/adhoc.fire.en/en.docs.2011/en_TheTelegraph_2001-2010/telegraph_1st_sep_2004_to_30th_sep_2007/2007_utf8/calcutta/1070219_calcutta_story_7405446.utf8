 Bonsai beauty

 Popularly known to be a traditional Japanese art, bonsai, the specialized technique of aesthetic miniaturization of trees by growing, pruning and training them in containers, actually originated in China. According to Japanese tradition, three forces come together in a good bonsai: truth, essence and beauty. Japanese bonsai are meant to retain the essential qualities of the plant being used. In all cases, they must look natural and never show the intervention of human hands. A successful bonsai is definitely a horticultural masterpiece. Bonsai can be developed from seeds or cuttings, from young trees or from naturally-occurring stunted trees transplanted into containers. Common subjects for bonsai include pine, maple, elm, flowering apricot, Japanese wisteria, juniper, flowering cherry, azalea and larch. The plants are grown outdoors and brought in to be displayed on special occasions when they most evoke the current season. As part of Japan-India Friendship amp; Exchange Year 2007 programme, Consulate-General of Japan, Calcutta presents a bonsai demonstration by Anjana Mukherjee, this evening at 6. The plants will be on display till tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sick flier forces landing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A passenger suffered a miscarriage mid-air, prompting the pilot to make an unscheduled landing at Calcutta airport on Monday.

 Nimade Sari Orawati, 32, a software professional from Singapore, was operated on at a city nursing home, where she has been kept in an intensive care unit.

 Orawati, of Indonesian origin, had gone to London on an official assignment and was returning home on a Singapore Airlines flight.

 After flying for several hours, she suddenly started bleeding. The passengers there were more than 300 on board panicked as her condition worsened.

 Some of the passengers told us that she lost consciousness several times. They could guess that she was having a miscarriage, said an airport official.

 With her condition deteriorating, the pilot decided to divert the flight to Calcutta airport, which was the nearest with the infrastructure to handle a big aircraft, said a Singapore Airlines official.

 The flight landed at Calcutta at 1.05pm and Orawati was rushed to the international terminal building in an ambulance, which was waiting in the bay. She was still bleeding and her blood pressure was quite low, said Sujit Bakshi, the medical officer of the Airports Authority of India, who examined Orawati.

 The airline officials took Orawati to the nursing home, where she underwent a surgery. Her condition was quite critical. Had there been any delay in treatment, the situation would have gone out of hand, said Barnali Ghosh, the gynaecologist who operated on Orawati.

 The flight finally took off at 3.20pm.

 In another incident, an Air Deccan flight from Dibrugarh to Calcutta made a priority landing at 9.30am after one of the passengers complained of uneasiness.

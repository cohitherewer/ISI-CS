The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Panel to decide on pond banks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 LET NATURE PREVAIL: The embankments of Rabindra Sarobar (Dhakuria Lakes) have been concretised, and environmentalists say this will affect the biodiversity of the waterbody. A Telegraph picture

 The state environment department has set up a committee to suggest the type of embankment ideal for waterbodies.

 Environmentalists have long been championing the cause of natural embankments. Concrete embankments, they argue, destroy the ecosystem of ponds.

 The panel, headed by environment secretary M.L. Meena, will look into this and other views and come up with recommendations by the end of this month.

 Representatives of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the state pollution control board are on the panel.

 There have been a few complaints against the move to concretise the embankments of ponds. The committees recommendations will help the government formulate a policy on the issue, said Meena.

 Since 2000, some government agencies have been trying to concretise the slopes of waterbodies in the city in a bid to protect them.

 There were efforts to replace the natural embankments of Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar with concrete ones. We protested the move, as it would affect the biodiversity of the ponds and turn them into swimming pools, said Mukuta Mukherjee, the secretary of the NGO Friends of Wetlands and Wildlife.

 In 2004, the organisation had filed a petition in Calcutta High Court, seeking an order against the move. The NGO said the case was disposed of recently after the civic body and various government departments agreed to its logic.

 Concrete embankments also prevent seepage of water from the side and contribute to waterlogging in the city, added Mukherjee.

 Sushil Sharma, the mayoral council member (environment), said the civic body was aware of the problems caused by permanent embankments. We welcome the formation of the committee, which will help sort out the problem permanently. According to Sharma, there are 3,000 ponds, big and small, in the city.

 Ponds should be left with natural embankments as far as possible, said environment activist Mohit Roy. If a wall has to be erected, it should be away from the slope to ensure the ecosystem of the pond is not affected.

 The committee is expected to hold its first meeting in the second week of July.

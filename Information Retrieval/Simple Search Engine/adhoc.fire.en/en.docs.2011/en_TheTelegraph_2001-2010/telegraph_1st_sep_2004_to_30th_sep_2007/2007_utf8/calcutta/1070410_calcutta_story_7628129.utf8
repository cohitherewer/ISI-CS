 Obituary

Fr. Gerard Beckers came to India in 1954 and fell in love with the country. The Belgian became an Indian citizen in 1978. Affectionately called Babu by his colleagues and students, this charismatic professor of chemistry at St Xaviers College, Calcutta, was known for his compassion for those less fortunate. 

 A doctor in biochemistry and a student-friendly teacher, he involved the college in helping poor students and those from rural areas. 

 He was an inspiration to many students, especially those from the tribal belt, for whom he started the Ananda Bhavan hostel on the college campus in 1964.

 All India Catholic University Federation (AICUF) flourished from 1959 when Babu was appointed adviser. With a view to inspiring social involvement, he organised work-cum-leadership camps on weekends and during vacations. 

 These camps helped students from different regions and religions meet rural people and understand their harsh realities.

 Fr. Beckers led the AICUF students rescue operations in the aftermath of the communal riots of 1964. Later, during the Naxalite movement, two failed attempts on his life left nine stitches on his scalp. A pamphlet had dubbed him a running dog of the imperialists. On the background of this radicalism, National Service Scheme (NSS) was introduced in St Xaviers College and Babu became its first director.

 Blood donation and eye donation movements received a fillip in West Bengal under his leadership. Fr. Beckers was the highest blood donor in Asia till 1990, when a fellow Jesuit from Chennai overtook his record. St Xaviers still maintains the tradition by organising bi-annual blood donation camps. 

 Following his death in December 2006, his mortal remains were handed over to NRS Medical College and Hospital as he had donated his body and eyes for furthering medical research and education. 

 In 1972, Fr. Beckers had organised a walk called, Walk for a fuller life, which raised Rs 2 lakh. The fund was used to build the second floor of the Students Health Home at Sealdah with an additional 20 beds. 

 The 1979 Sherpur Project another brainchild of his turned the faltering economy of the Murshidabad village on its head. 

 After retiring from St Xaviers in 1984, he characteristically spent many years among the santhals in Kalna, Pandua and Charmusai. He had to spend the last few years of his life in the St Xaviers School infirmary. He had been suffering from Parkinsons Disease.

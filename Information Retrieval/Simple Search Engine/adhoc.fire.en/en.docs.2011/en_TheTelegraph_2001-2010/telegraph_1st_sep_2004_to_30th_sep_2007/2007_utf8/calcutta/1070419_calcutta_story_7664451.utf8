 A division bench of Justice P.C. Ghosh and Justice B. Somadder on Wednesday directed the state government to immediately put covers on open manholes and drains to avoid accidents.

 The order was passed on a petition by Taz Beghum and others. The petitioners had demanded compensation for the family members of 6-year-old Ashish Yadav, who died after falling into a manhole on August 19, 2006. The court did not pass any order regarding payment of compensation to the family.

 The chairman of the North Dum Dum municipality, where Yadav had fallen into the manhole, was summoned to the court in connection with the case. Dilip Bhattacharya, the chairman, told the judges that he would take steps to cover manholes in the area within his jurisdiction. 

 The judges said the municipality chairman and the state government should draw lessons from the death of people who fell into manholes.

 The petitioners counsel, Idris Ali, told the court that in 2001, a 20-year-old man died after falling into a manhole in Maniktala. Following a public interest litigation, the high court had directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to provide a job to a family member of the victim, said Ali.

 The CMC had pointed out to the court that there were gangs stealing manhole-covers across the city. It has become an impossible task for the CMC to keep a regular vigil. But the civic workers take immediate action if they see an open manhole, said CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Repairs on airport runway

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The primary runway of Calcutta airport was shut down for repairs for more than six hours on Monday. Services were not disrupted, as planes took off from and landed on the secondary runway.

 An airport official said 28 flights took off from the 2,399-metre-long runway between 11.40am and 6pm, when the 3,627-metre-long primary runway was closed. The same number of flights landed on the secondary runway during the period.

 The primary runway was repaired after its surface was found to have become uneven. The maintenance work had to be completed before the arrival of the monsoon. So, the runway was shut down, said airport director V.K. Monga.

 The repairs couldnt have been taken up without suspending the flight operations. It is for the safety of aircraft and passengers, he pointed out.

 A stretch of one of the taxiing bays, which connects the main runway with the parking bays, is also under repairs. It will remain closed till June 9. 

 Around four months ago, the primary runway was shut down for two hours for maintenance work, said the official.

 In November last year, the runway had to be closed down for one-and-a-half hours after an aircraft of a private airline made a sharp turn towards a taxiing bay, peeling off a layer of concrete.

 The primary runway had last undergone an overhaul nearly two years ago.

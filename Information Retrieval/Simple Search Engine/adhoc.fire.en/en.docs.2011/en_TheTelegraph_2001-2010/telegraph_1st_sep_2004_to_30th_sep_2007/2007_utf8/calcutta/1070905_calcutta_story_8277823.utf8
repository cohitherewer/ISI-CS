The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Roster of rights, services

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Calcuttans will soon be armed with a citizens charter, which will set a deadline for civic services being carried out.

 The charter, which aims to improve public life, is being prepared at the behest of the British governments Department for International Development (DFID).

 The department, which has been providing grants to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for infrastructure upgrade, has been insisting on improvement of civic services and a mechanism to help citizens enforce their rights.

 The mayor will announce the charter next month, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Tuesday. It will be published in newspapers and also posted on the Internet.

 The charter will spell out what a Calcuttan can expect from the civic authorities, the deadline for delivery of services and the fees to be paid.

 To increase accountability, names and phone numbers of the officials responsible for dealing with citizens complaints will be mentioned in the charter.

 If an official fails to complete work within the stipulated time, he has to explain the delay, said Bandyopadhyay.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the exercise is aimed at fixing responsibility and getting work executed smoothly.

 Once the charter is introduced, he added, the citizens, too, must shoulder some responsibility to make the city a better place to live in. They should report any instance of illegal construction, filling up of ponds or felling of trees in their locality.

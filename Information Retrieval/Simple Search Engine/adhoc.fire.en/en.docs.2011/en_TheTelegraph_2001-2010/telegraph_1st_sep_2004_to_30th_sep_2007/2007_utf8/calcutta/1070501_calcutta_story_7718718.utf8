The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rescued woman reads newspaper

 A STAFF REORTER 

Madhabi Das spent her third peaceful day at Antaragram, a rehabilitation centre in Baruipur, on the southern fringes, on Monday. She was rescued on Saturday from a first-floor room of her Uma Charan Ray Road home, where she had been kept confined by her in-laws for the past 15 years. 

 On Monday, Madhabi (Telegraph picture) conversed with the inmates of the home as she watched television and had her food without any help, said Swapna Jha, the doctor supervising her treatment at Antaragram.

 When she was brought here, she couldnt utter a word. On Sunday, she could tell us her name and her husbands. Today, she exchanged a few words with the other inmates and even read the newspaper, said the doctor. Though there are gradual signs of physical recovery in Madhabi, the wounds in her mind will be hard to heal, added the doctor.

 On Saturday, neighbours and members of the local club, Sangram Sangha, rescued an unconscious Madhabi from her dark, dirty room. She was mentally unstable. 

 We are quite concerned about her health and are visiting her regularly as there is no one to look after her, said Kaveri Chakraborty, the Dass next-door neighbour.

 General secretary of the club Rajendra Prasad Gupta said on Monday that the neighbourhood has started making preparations for Madhabis treatment and rehabilitation, with support from the local MP Sujan Chakraborty.

 We are concerned about her rehabilitation, as it will be not possible for her to stay at the centre for an indefinite period, said Gupta.

 On Saturday, the police arrested Madhabis husband Madhu Das, her daughter and mother-in-law Amala for torturing and confining her for years in an inhuman and claustrophobic condition. 

 The accused were remanded in judicial custody for two weeks by the chief judicial magistrate on Sunday.

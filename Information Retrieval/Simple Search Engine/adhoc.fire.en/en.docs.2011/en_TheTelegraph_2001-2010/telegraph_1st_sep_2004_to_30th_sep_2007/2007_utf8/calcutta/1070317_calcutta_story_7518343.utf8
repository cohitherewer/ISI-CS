 Housewives need not feel left out any more while their husbands talk shares and stocks. Heres Millennium Mams for them a study circle working to empower married women with the knowledge of economics, market trends and the art of investing.

 There are many married women who are not involved in any profession and are ignorant of the business world. We want to boost their confidence, so they could start their own venture or lend a helping hand to their husbands businesses, said Bishnu Dhanuka, who had initiated the project along with Sanjay Bhuwania.

 We organise seminars across the country and have visited several girls colleges to spread awareness, added Dhanuka, director of Millennium Mams.

 The Crystal Room at Taj Bengal was abuzz on Wednesday afternoon, with an eager group of women coming together to observe the 12th annual conference of Millennium Mams. Textile designer Sujata Sarawgi was awarded for her efforts to improve the living condition of rural weavers.

 The organisation now has 80 students enrolled in its interactive course that involves reading and analysing papers to understand inflation, GDP and other related issues. It has two other sections Mams Forte, which hosts seminars and discussions, and Millennium Youth, designed for college-goers who are taught the fundamentals of the capital market at a month-long camp every year. Seats for Millennium Mams classes are limited to only 35 women.

 Details about the organisation and the courses can be obtained from its website www.mmamsindia.org.

 2 detained for girl death

 Moushumi Sutradhar: Unnatural death 

Two young men have been detained in connection with the unnatural death of an 18-year-old girl, whose body was fished out of the Hooghly on Monday night.

 A boatman and his assistants saw the body of Moushumi Sutradhar, who lived in the Sinthee police station area, being borne away by the low tide near Sarbamangala Ghat, in Cossipore, around 9pm.

 Moushumis father Narayan accused Dilip Sau, a student of Class XII, and Deepak Jha, a commerce student, of being involved in her death, said a senior officer of North Port police station. The youths live in Cossipore.

 The girls elder sister, Rekha, alleged that Deepak had a relationship with Moushumi but later refused to marry her, and finally, killed her.

 Deepak denied any relationship with Moushumi and said he was going steady with a woman from Lake Town.

 My sister left the house around 7.30pm on Monday for a local public call office, where she worked. Around 9.30pm, someone called our home and told us that she had met with an accident and had been taken to hospital, said Rekha.

 The call was made from a cellphone, she added.

 According to the police, Moushumi called Dilip around 9.30pm and requested him to ask his friend Deepak to come to the Sarbamangala Ghat jetty, where she would wait for him.

 It seems the girl was fished out soon after she dropped into the river from the jetty. We have to find out whether she tried to commit suicide or somebody pushed her into the river, the officer of North Port police station said.

 Winged visitors

 A visitor views migratory birds

 at Santragachhi Jheel. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta

 The weed-choked

 Santragachhi Railway Jheel displays

 a brown surface. With two telescopes

 and several binoculars doing the

 rounds, however, one discovers these

 are hundreds of brown Lesser Whistling

 Duck or Saral on the surface of

 the waterbody. A second look through

 the binoculars and it is a pair

 of Common Teal staring back at you. This species is rarely seen in Calcutta. This is the first pair we have spotted here, said

 Supriyo Samanta of Prakriti Samsad,

 an association of nature lovers

 that organised its third annual

 bird watch on January 27 and 28.

 The event drew youngsters eager to partake of the variety of winged visitors to Santragachhi this winter, including the Swinhoes Snipe and the Northern Shoveller. Anita Prasad, a history teacher at Modern High School for Girls, who accompanied 90 students from Class VII remarked: The students were very enthusiastic, even though they had to give up a holiday to come here. The visit is part of their project in environmental studies, a mandatory subject for them. They are eager for a second trip.

 Tanmoy Haldar, a first-year student of botany at Vivekananda College, who had dropped in, said: Our professor told us about the bird watching session. I was especially impressed by the large numbers of Cotton Pygmy Goose. There were about 30 of them.

 Prakriti Samsad had distributed copies of a checklist of the English and local names of the migratory birds to all the visitors so that they could tick off the species they had spotted. Secretary Kushal Mookherjee explained: The birds leave to forage for food in the evening and return to the waterbody early in the morning. Thats when they can be seen in large numbers. Birds like the Northern Pintail and the Northern Shoveller come here from North Asia and Europe.

 Yet, all is not well with Santragachhi Jheel. Sudipto Saha, a postgraduate student of zoology at Maulana Azad College, rued: There is a great variety of birds here. But the lake is in a very sad condition, being partially choked with algae. Despite the presence of waste bins, people throw garbage into the water.

 Mookherjee said: This is one of the last resorts of bird life near Calcutta. The number of birds this year was 4,797. It is a good site for birds since they return despite local disturbances. But there is an urgent need to save the waterbody from pollutants.

 The

 Diary

 How have you been?

 How

 have you been my scarlet girl? 

 Are

 you still afraid of the flutes? 

 What

 did you do as the universe slowly died and

 left behind ashes and claws? What did you

 do when the birds lost their way home and

 shed their wings upon the city? 

 Did

 you hear the shriek of the city as the

 universe

 disappeared? 

 I

 was there too when it happened but

 I was looking at the poem outside my window 

 and

 at the light coming from your room 

 I

 was revolving in my mouth 

 a

 thousand prayers for your soft veins 

 But

 you watched it whole, didnt you?

 So

 tell me, what did you do 

 when

 violet

 babies laughed 

 in

 a sky of jaguars and archangels?

 Inam Hussain Mullick, 

 English, JU

 The

 cupids kit 

 Life is dreary and slow

 yet we keep expecting more and more 

 The

 path we are to tread is surrounded by mist 

 And

 yet we strive to run the race for eternal bliss

 Happiness

 is bleak and I carry a mourning heart learnt

 to be meek 

 They

 say love is a rare treasure to find

 Today

 I know Ive craved for it coz it was

 always on my mind 

 Just coz I didnt

 get it doesnt mean I dont want it

 Hope

 still keeps me hoping that someday

 my prince will come to me carrying

 the 

 Cupids kit.

 Cops talk turf as mishap man dies

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 What happens if a bus knocks down a man in front of a police station during a change of shift? He bleeds to death, while the cops decide whose responsibility it is to take him to hospital. 

 Around 10.30 pm on Tuesday, Amit Yadav was run over by a bus on Prince Anwar Shah Road, a few yards from Jadavpur police station. The officers chose to wait for their colleagues from the next shift to make the first move and then, on realising that the accident spot was not within their jurisdiction, passed the buck to officers of Lake thana.

 This, despite students from the Jadavpur University hostel in the neighbourhood urging the officers to act.

 All the while, the 27-year-old employee of a mobile phone company lay bleeding on the road. He later died at MR Bangur Hospital.

 A day after the mishap, the South 24-Parganas police top brass admitted that it was unjustified to have left the youth bleeding on the road citing jurisdiction problems.

 At a meeting to address traffic problems in the area, the officers agreed that the incident could have been handled better a realisation that will not mean a thing for Amarnath Yadav of 14/4 Roopchand Roy Street, in Burrabazar, who lost his son.

 There was a problem due to the timing of the mishap. The staff was busy with the change of shift. But that cant be a justification for the inaction. Besides, there was no need to cite jurisdiction. The guilty officers will be brought to book, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.

 On Wednesday, a team of senior officers, led by additional superintendent D.P. Singh, submitted a report to Gupta stating the events leading to Amits death.

 The report, insiders claimed, says that when the students rushed to the police station from the hostel, they came across an officer and asked him to intervene. He was busy talking on his cellphone and asked the students to contact the officer on duty, who in turn took a long time to react. 

 He sought the help of the mobile team out on rounds. By the time the team turned up, Amits condition had deteriorated. The officer heading the mobile team realised that the area was under the jurisdiction of Lake police station and informed the officers there.

 By the time we reached, the youth had almost died. The traffic department is probing the death. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said an officer of Lake police station.

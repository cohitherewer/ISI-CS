 From a tribute to Mozart through Indian classical and contemporary dances to an international workshop by ace choreographers to a show at Max Mueller Bhavan, the Sapphire Dance Company is going places with its daring creative innovations. 

 On January 15, Sapphire explored the nuances of Mozarts music with innovative and distinctive dance idioms, first of its kind in the city. Odissi exponent Dipanwita Roy and her troupe danced to Mozarts Allegro in a traditional Odissi mangalacharan style.

 Mitul Ghosh Sengupta, Kathak dancer, and Ronnie Shambik Ghosh, from Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts, danced to Mozarts Rondo. 

 Recorded music by Jean Francois Paillard was played in the background, as the two dancers presented their creation combining bits of Kathak, ballet, jazz, tap dance and martial art. Chiranjoy Poddar, Kuchipudi exponent, effectively used Mozarts Allegro Aperto and presented an illustration of Sita harana from Ramayana.

 Very few Calcuttans listen to Mozart. Our effort was to help people relate and react to the maestro. So, we thought that if the classical and the contemporary dancers could give their reactions to the soundscapes evoked by Mozart, it would be more catching, explained Sudarshan Chakravarty, director of Sapphire.

 The group is also conducting an interactive session for its students at Sapphires Salt Lake headquarters between January 20 and 30, which will feature international artistes from various fields like dance, film-making and art. The interactive session will culminate with a performance by the ace dancers at Max Mueller on January 31.

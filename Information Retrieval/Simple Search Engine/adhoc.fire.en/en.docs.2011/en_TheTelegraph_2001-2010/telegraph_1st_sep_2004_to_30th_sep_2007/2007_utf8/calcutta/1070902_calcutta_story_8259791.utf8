 Electric train chorona gari chharle uthona/Emon moja pabe na, chokhey koyla jabe na

 Forty-five years ago, hawkers at haats, the weekly village markets, would go around singing this ode to the new sensation, the electric train, and selling the lines on single quarto sheets (one sheet folded in half twice at right angles to make four leaves). It was called Current-er Garir Gaan.

 The rhyme was on the back cover of a work of fiction titled Narir Hatey Riskawala Dakat Jobdo (Woman Tames Robber Rickshaw-puller). In the hawkers stock would be other salacious fare Kumarir Santan Prasab O Premer Samadhi (A Virgin Gives Birth and the Death of Love) or Kolir Bodhur Swamir Ghar (The Marriage of Woman Too Modern). The lurid occupied pride of place. 

 These books, called heto boi (books sold in haats), never reached the confines of a library or the drawing room of the respectable. Yet street literature comprises a total subculture, revealing significant reading practices of the time, says Sukanta Chaudhuri, professor of English at Jadavpur University and director of the School of Cultural Texts and Records. A wealth of such printed chapbooks is being digitally archived at the school. 

 Last Wednesday, the school unveiled some of its work. There was an audio feast of Hindusthani classical music, sourced from private collections and digitally recorded. An audio-visual collage of poet Shakti Chattopadhyays interviews and recitations is part of it too. A software, christened Pathantar, which compared different versions of a text, was demonstrated with Tagores Bisarjan. Work is now on to collate manuscripts of Tagores Manasi and Sonar Tari. 

 The heto boi is a thrust area. These books are published across Bengal, have a wider reach and range of subjects and a still more popular clientele than the bot-tala titles which were published from a fixed address in Chitpur, Chaudhuri said.

 Project fellows are scanning various specimens from joke books to poems on events of the day. Subhaser Apurba Lila paints Netajis feats in fantastic colours. The writer, Mahadeb Saha, knows the tricks of the trade. Agrim dosh ti naya paysa diya boi loiben notuba deoa nishedh (Pay 10p in advance or else the sale of the book is prohibited), he warns on the cover.

 One interesting acquisition for the school is kissa literature, its language heavy with Arabic-Persian influence. Starting backside up and read right page first like Urdu texts, a large number of such texts, priced at 20p, were printed by Osmania Library in Mechhuabazar Street and carried the logo of a mosque high up on the cover. Kissa (tales, but with a hint of scandal) and kechchha (scandal) were innocent words then. A Laila-Majnu story may start with the announcement kechchha shuru and launch straight into praise of the Poigombor. 

 Another interesting specimen of a morality tale, brought out by a different publisher, is Paap Agune Biman Dhongsho. For Re 1, it tells the story of a burqa-clad devout belle how she boarded an aeroplane with every inch of her flesh covered in a burqa and how that garb of modesty turned into an all-purpose life jacket when the plane was hijacked and blown up. The burqa had ballooned into a parachute. 

 It wasnt as if such miracles were confined to a single community. There is Sadhoker Deho Smashaane Phule Parinata (Ascetics body turns into a flower at the burning ghat), printed in 1966 and costing 14p, that claims the authenticity of history (kahini itihas hoite songrohito). The appetite for believe-it-or-not facts remains undead. As recently as 1991, a series was on sale called Ajob Khobor Ashchorjo Ghotona, costing 50p. 

 These books are always innovative, be they from the 40s, or the 70s or today, closely reflecting the times, Chaudhuri says. If the market for street literature has shifted from the haat to the running train or long-distance bus, the self-help books have evolved from Repair a Radio to Repair a Cellphone today.

 Tagore, freed from copyright clauses, sells in a low-cost avatar for Rs 20, so what if he has to withstand the editor of Sunirbachito Rabindrasangeet appropriating the credit for the music and lyrics! Changes over time are more marked in production. Though still cheaply priced, their covers are now bright and garish, no longer black and white.

 With increasing literacy, a huge demand exists for these books that fulfil a wonderful social need by catering to neo-literates who have little formal publication to fall back on, says Chaudhuri.

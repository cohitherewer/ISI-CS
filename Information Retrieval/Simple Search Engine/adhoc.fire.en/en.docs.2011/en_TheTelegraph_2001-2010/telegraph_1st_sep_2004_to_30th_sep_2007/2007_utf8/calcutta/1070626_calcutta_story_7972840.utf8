 Whoop of joy blocks bail

 - Court refuses to free teenagers alleged killers on cricket field

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Mohammad Imran, 18, clubbed to death with cricket bats on the Maidan

 The public prosecutors submission was clear: There was no repentance. As the teenager lay unconscious on the ground, bleeding from the mouth, his assailants laughed. There were whoops of joy and celebrations. It was a very cruel act.

 Ashimesh Goswami was trying to convince the division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice Arun Bhattacharya not to grant bail to the alleged killers of 18-year-old Mohammad Imran. The boy was clubbed to death with cricket bats and wickets during a dispute over vacating a patch on the Maidan on April 30.

 The judges turned down the bail prayers of the four accused, who had moved court on Monday. The other three arrested for the killing did not plead for bail on Monday. 

 On April 30, Imran and his friends were playing football on the Maidan. Around 4.15pm, 15 to 20 youngsters with bats and wickets asked them to vacate the ground.

 Producing the report of the investigation conducted by Hastings police, Goswami said: When Imran and his friends refused to budge, the other teenagers started to beat them up. His friends fled but Imran fell down and was hit repeatedly with bats and wickets.

 A seriously injured Imran was taken to SSKM Hospital and then to BM Birla Heart Research Institute, where he died.

 During interrogation, the accused revealed how they had beaten up the boy mercilessly while he cried for help and tried to fend off the blows. The accused reacted to a minor incident without any sympathy and did not repent for their action, said the prosecutor.

 He told the court that even after blood started oozing from Imrans mouth and head, the youths kept beating him till he lost consciousness. Instead of feeling remorse, they were cheering and laughing and celebrating as Imrans limp body lay on the playground.

 Goswami argued that this was tantamount to organised crime, which is increasing across the city. 

 Both the state and the central governments have decided to revise criminal laws to tackle the alarming situation. Juvenile crime has resulted in frequent deaths and is becoming a threat to the society, he argued.

 The lawyers appearing for the four accused Bikash Paswan, Mohammad Anwar, Anwar Ahmed and Sukhdeo Dolui, aged between 16 and 18 and all residents of Ekbalpur submitted that the incident was merely an accident.

 The teenagers did not have any intention of killing the boy. The blows from the blunt weapon somehow turned fatal. Therefore, they cannot be called murderers, the defence lawyers stated.

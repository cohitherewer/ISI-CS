 Tankers on route to normality

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The five-day strike by the West Bengal Tankers Association (WBTA) was called off and oil tankers were allowed to roll out of depots in Budge Budge, Mourigram and Haldia from 4 pm on Tuesday to ferry gas to filling stations across the city

 Though Calcuttans, gasping for gas supplies for five days, heaved a sigh of relief, the situation will not return to normal before Wednesday evening, the time taken for tankers to reach the filling stations.

 The public transport system in the city was badly hit. On Tuesday, over 70 per cent public and private buses stayed off the road. Only 10 to 15 per cent of the citys taxis plied and many private cars were perforce confined to their garages.

 Were keeping our terminals at Budge Budge, Mourigram and Haldia open till 10 pm so that we can supply till late at night. We want to ensure one load of petrol and diesel each for all pumps, said an IOC spokesperson.

 The WBTA decided to defer its strike on a request from transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. Union petroleum minister Murli Deora told me that he would be back from Libya in 10 days and requested that the strike be deferred till his return, when he will take up the issue, he said.

 The tug-of-war between the tanker owners and the oil companies was over hiring charges offered. The WBTA, unhappy with the Rs 111.77 per kilolitre per km rate, was demanding Rs 130 per kilolitre per km, while the oil companies offered to go up to Rs 122.67 per kilolitre per km.

 IOC marketing director G.C. Daga met chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb at Writers Buildings on Tuesday to take stock of the situation.

 Though the strike has been called off, Ajit Das, WBTA general secretary, said: We will not sign a new agreement with the oil companies unless we get better rates.

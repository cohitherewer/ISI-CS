 Voice-based service to find matches 

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 If you want to impress your prospective mothers-in-law, sing a Rabindrasangeet. If you are an ace guitarist, woo your brides-to-be with a romantic number. And speak in whichever language you want to. All of this over a recorded message over the cellphone.

 BharatMatrimony has launched Indias first voice-based matrimony service in alliance with Airtel and OnMobile. Termed the first of its kind, the service allows users to record, listen, and also send and receive voice messages on their mobile.

 Psychologists say an impression can be formed of a persons character from ones voice, explains Murugavel Janakiraman, founder and CEO, BharatMatrimony. One can also express oneself better through speech. There is no restriction on the time to record a message.

 Match-making online has been in vogue in India for some time. The marriage portal, which has earned a place in the Limca Book of Records for facilitating the highest number of marriages, has been growing by more than 100 per cent annually for the past four years. This is a midway between love and arranged marriage. While individuals make the initial choices, parents get involved later. 

 But, according to Janakiraman, the web-based form lacks in interactivity. Voice Matrimony would address that deficiency by enabling registered members of BharatMatrimony to record, listen to, send and receive voice messages.

 The recorded data of the members will be hosted on the server of OnMobile after a validation of content by BharatMatrimony. When a member receives a new message, he will be notified by SMS. This way you do not need to reveal your mobile number. The charge will be Rs 6 per minute.

 The matrimony solutions provider had earlier launched marriage bureaux across the country, including five in Bengal. Unlike the website, this was targeted at offline parents who come, register and get printouts on compatible matches. It has hosted match-making events too. With mobiles reaching every hand, the service is being offered on a new platform. We do not want to push technology on users. Rather, technology has to suit customer needs, he sums up.

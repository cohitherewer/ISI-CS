 2 in net for reservoir murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A CMDA supervisor and a labourer supplier were arrested on Monday in connection with the murder of the man whose body was found floating in the reservoir of Padmapukur Water Treatment Plant in Howrah on Friday.

 Police believe that the body could be of 30-year-old Shakeel Murmu, a CMDA contract labourer from Sahebgunj in Jharkhand. He was working at the site. A police team has left from Sahebgunj to ascertain the identity of the body.

 A murder case has been started after injuries were found on the body. It has been sent to Medical and College and Hospital for another post-mortem. Shakeel had been missing since September 4. A bag containing his clothes was found near the reservoir.

 Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh said: Achinta Mandal, the supervisor, suppressed the fact that Shakeel had not been seen since September 4.

 After preliminary investigation, the police are sure that the youth was killed inside the water treatment plant.

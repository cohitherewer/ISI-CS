 A pool car carrying eight children to school rammed into a tree in Salt Lakes EC block on Tuesday morning. The driver and his help were flung out by the impact and the right side of the car was badly damaged, but the children escaped with minor injuries. 

 A guardian travelling in the car to ensure the safety of the children was also injured.

 Police found that the car had re-treaded tyres, two of which burst, causing the driver to lose control. Some other parts of the car were also not in roadworthy condition. 

 The children, between three and four years old, said the car was being driven very fast.

 I was standing near EC 39 around 7.45am. The front right and rear tyres of the Tata Sumo burst. It hit the tree and then rolled on to collide with a lamp post. Some local residents and I rescued the children, said Sukumar Jana, a rickshaw-puller.

 The eight children study in the preparatory class of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. They were taken to a nearby private hospital and discharged after first aid. 

 We have started a case against Sambhu Ghosh, the driver, said Ashoke Biswas, the additional superintendent of police (Salt Lake). 

 Apart from Ghosh and his help Ranjit, Mounak Chowdhury, the father of Samrik, one of the children, was in the front seat of the car. 

 We are ready to pay extra money to these pool-car operators. But they still drive fast to make more trips. Today, they picked up the last child barely 15 minutes before school was to start. Naturally, they were driving fast, risking the lives of the children, said Kaushik Chaudhury, father of three-and-a-half-year-old Koustav, who was in the car. 

 Uncle was driving very fast. Suddenly, something happened and I was hurt in my leg and below my eyes, said Koustavs classmate Soham, who was also in the car. I dont want to ride the car again.

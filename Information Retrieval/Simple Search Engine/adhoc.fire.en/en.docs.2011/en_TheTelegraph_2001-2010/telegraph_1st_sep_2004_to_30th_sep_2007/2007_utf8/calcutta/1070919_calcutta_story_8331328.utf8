 Beyond academics

 - B-school on campus site hunt

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 Plans to set up an Icfai university in the state have been put on hold, as the proposal is still under government consideration. But Icfai Business School (IBS) is going ahead with setting up a full-fledged campus in the city in the next two years.

 IBS is scouting for land on Diamond Harbour Road and Kona Expressway to set up a residential campus for students and teachers.

 We have not given up on the university. But we are yet to hear from the government. For now, we are concentrating on a residential campus for IBS because management education is not just about academics. It is a way of life, said Santanu Ray, director, IBS, Calcutta.

 The B-school has been operating out of a 100,000-sq-ft campus, spread over three different locations in Sector V, as land in and around the area is over the budget. 

 We will be able to buy only five acres at our price in the Rajarhat area. Which is why we are looking at land a little further away from the city, said Ray, at a press conference to announce the opening of admission tests for the class of 2010.

 The campus will see an investment of Rs 100 crore and will be spread over 30 acres and is expected to be ready in two years.

 IBS Calcutta is also expanding its other activities. Apart from conducting management courses and research, it is taking on consultancy for corporate houses and the government.

 The institute will prepare a skill bank for the Shalboni area, where the Jindals are setting up a steel plant. The competency mapping will look into the skill sets that the people of the area have, which will enable the company to provide them suitable jobs. The team working on the project is currently finalising the proposal.

 Icfai Republic School, an English-medium school for slum children, started in April, will be replicated in other places across the city. The second school in Beleghata will be ready in the next couple of months. Ten more are to come up in another year. 

 IBS has applied for deemed university status. It will take time for the decision to come through, said Ray. Once the parent body in Hyderabad gets the tag, all we will need is a no-objection certificate from the state government, added Ray.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Fab four of jazz fusion

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Final Flourish 

After the acoustic concert with jazz luminaries Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter along with The Thelonious Monk Institute Band last Sunday, Calcutta is in for a treat with four musicians from the US here to electrify the Congo Square JazzFest on the final evening.

 The Scott Kinsey Group is led by Scott (top picture), the keyboard mastermind (Tribal Tech, Joe Zawinul, piano contributor for movies such as Oceans Eleven, Oceans Twelve, Analyze That).

 ongside Matthew Garrison, probably the hottest bassist in the world today, he has contributed to hundreds of albums and toured with the likes of Herbie Hancock, John McLaughlin and John Scofield.

 Powerhouse drummer Kirk Covington, ex-member of the Zawinul Syndicate, Tribal Tech and Allan Holdsworth, and saxophonist Seamus Blake from The John Scofield Band, who also happens to be the winner of the Thelonious Monk Competition 2002 (judged by Wayne Shorter) complete the line-up.

 The group will perform two sets of electrifying music at Dalhousie Institute (DI) on Monday, January 22.

 AbstractLogix Recording artiste Scott Kinseys album Kinesthetics (picture above ), released worldwide in October 2006, has been one of the top-selling fusion albums getting rave reviews. Downbeat gives it three-and-a-half stars and AllaboutJazz calls his music Weather Report thinking forward. Keyboard Magazine calls the album fun, energetic, captivating music, the kind that lifts you by the seat of your pants up into the clouds to boogie the night away.

 President of AbstractLogix and Calcutta native Souvik Dutta says: This ought to be an amazing event. We had legends of jazz last weekend in town and next week well have the leaders of the next generation here. Scott Kinseys music is very upbeat, energetic, groovy and full of African and world music elements that will have people on their feet. These guys are stellar and they are as good as they come.

 Dutta feels the gig would be very entertaining not only for jazzheads, but for rock and dance music fans as well, and people of all ages and kids too. His music defies categorisation. For me, its very special. We are very excited to work with our friends at Congo Square again in bringing high-quality music to Calcutta, he says.

 In addition to his work with Tribal Tech (featuring Scott Henderson and Gary Willis), Scott has performed and recorded with Bill Evans, Robben Ford, Gary Willis, Joe Zawinul, Sonic Trance... Matthew is son of bassist Jimmy Garrison (played with John Coltrane), grew up with godfather Jack DeJohnette and bassist Dave Holland.

 His professional career began with the likes of Gary Burton, Bob Moses, and Lyle Mays. Matthew moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 1994 and has performed and recorded with artistes like Herbie Hancock, Wallace Roney, Joe Zawinul, Joni Mitchell, Steve Coleman, Pat Metheny, John McLaughlin, The Gil Evans Orchestra, John Scofield and Chaka Khan.

 Kirk Covington is recognised as one of the most versatile and dynamic drummers of today. He is the Wild Man From Texas that jazz-fusion audiences all over the world, are talking about.

 New York-based tenor saxophonist/composer Seamus Blake has toured with John Scofield, worked regularly with the Mingus Big Band, and headed his own electronic group, the Bloomdaddies.

 He was included in the 1997 Downbeat Critics Poll as an artiste deserving of wider recognition. Pat Metheny has described him as the best tenor player Ive heard in a couple of years (JazzTimes April 1997). John Scofield, who hired him for his Quiet Band, calls him extraordinary, a total saxophonist.

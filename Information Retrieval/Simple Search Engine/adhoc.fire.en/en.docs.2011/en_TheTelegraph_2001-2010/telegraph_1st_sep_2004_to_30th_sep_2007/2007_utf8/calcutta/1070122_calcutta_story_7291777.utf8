 Success via self-belief

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sourav Ganguly: Focussed

 The man: Sourav 

 Ganguly strides out to take strike for his first ODI in 

 15 months and scores 98 off 109 balls.

 The message: 

 If you are on the wrong side of 30 and facing a mid-career 

 crisis, send an SOS to Sourav Ganguly.

 Those who know a thing or three about being setting goals and achieving them doffed their hat to crickets comeback man on Sunday.

 Lets start with someone who helped kick-start the comeback process, quite literally. He never thought of giving up, says Montu Das, who trained Sourav in kickboxing for two months after he was dropped from Team India.

 Dada told me specifically that he wanted to improve his reflexes and flexibility. He said when he would rejoin the team, he would be competing with youngsters like Raina and Kaif and so he wanted to be fit and agile, adds Das.

 So, it was always a matter of when he would be back where be belongs, not if.

 That is the lesson budding managers must learn from Souravs down-but-not-out saga, says Arijit Biswas, regional head of human resources, TCS. The key to his comeback has been self-belief. The moment he was dropped, he chalked out an action plan, stuck to it and is now back with a bang.

 Anindya Sen, dean programme initiatives, IIM, Calcutta, sees Sourav as a role model: Our young managers can learn a valuable lesson from the way he has made a comeback, especially his focus and self-confidence, which are vital for battling career odds and being successful.

 A B-school case study on the comeback boy from Behala, anyone?

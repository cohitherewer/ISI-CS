 Green light for CU grant

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University (CU) has received the final nod from the University Grants Commission (UGC) to spend the Rs 10-crore preliminary grant, sanctioned to it last year for achieving the centre of excellence status.

 On the basis of UGC suggestions, the CU authorities held a meeting on Friday to finalise the utilisation of the money.

 The fund will have to be spent by March 2008.

 Even though the centre of excellence tag came in April last year, the grant had been beyond the universitys reach. This was partly due to a delay by the CU authorities in completing an important formality, of submitting their final action plan to the UGC on how they proposed to spend the total grant of Rs 30 crore.

 However, the UGC last week granted permission to the university to spend the funds.

 A report prepared by the UGC has identified certain areas that the university will have to develop by utilising the grant. 

 It has recommended that Rs 6.4 crore be spent on the upgrade of common facilities, and Rs 4 crore on the construction of a building for examination and result-related work.

 According to the report, general research should see an allowance of Rs 2.96 crore, and social science research another Rs 2.6 crore.

 A sum of Rs 1 crore each has to be spent on setting up a training centre for non-teaching staff and improvement of the central library and museum, and Rs 75 lakh will be allotted for computerisation of the accounts section, says the report.

 We will start implementing with immediate effect all the UGC recommendations under the centre-of-excellence funds scheme, P.N. Ghosh, dean of the universitys science faculty, said after Fridays meeting.

 Two days after Pampa Roy, a Howrah homemaker, found out that she was taking the wrong pill due to a fault of the chemist, she was admitted to a private nursing home after her physical condition deteriorated on Friday morning. 

 I was feeling very weak this morning and I could not even stand. My husband called up our doctor and he advised immediate hospitalisation, Pampa, lying on the bed No. 112 of Arogya Niketan, at Uttarpara, told Metro on Friday evening. 

 Several tests were carried out on her during the course of the day. According to the attending doctors, her condition improved in the evening. 

 The 26-year-old resident of Dewangazi Road, Bally, is paying the price of a faux pas at a local chemists. Her doctor Susanta Kumar Kundu had prescribed Riton to tackle excessive uterine bleeding. But at Relief Medical Centre, a chemists shop near Bally Bazaar, she was given Ritolan instead of Riton. 

 Pampas physical condition started deteriorating after she took the wrong pill. Price discrepancy during the repeat purchase of the medicine made it clear that she was popping the wrong pill. Sandip Roy, her husband, lodged a complaint with Bally police station on Wednesday. 

 But on Friday, Sandip withdrew the complaint that he had lodged at the Bally police station. As the owner of the shop has agreed to bear the medical expenses, I have withdrawn the complaint, said Sandip, amid rumours that Bally Bazaar Byabsayee Samiti had asked him to withdraw his complaint. 

 Sandip, owner of a shop dealing in CDs, is also a member of the association. 

 According to sources in the locality, the office-bearers of the association played a big role in making Sandip agree to the proposal of Aparesh Mukherjee, owner of the medicine shop. 

 Though there is no proof that the medicine was bought from my shop, I believe Sandip as he is also a member of our association. I have agreed to meet Pampas medical bills and they are happy with my gesture, said Mukherjee, relieved after the withdrawal of the complaint.

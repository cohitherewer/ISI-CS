 Sourav has returned to Team India with a bang. He is now more focused, determined and eager for runs and wickets. His present form will speak for itself. Moreover, his relaxed movement, temperament and improved fitness, has proved that he has worked very hard for this comeback. He has silenced his critics and Team India coach Greg Chappell, who once questioned his fitness and batting skills. 

 Moumita Majumder, 

 Madhyamgram

 Sourav is back with a lot of dreams and has proved his mettle with his performance against South Africa and West Indies. He had struggled to regain his lost position in Team India. His homework and practice have brought out the real player in him and has also proved that he is still better than many big names.

 To talk about a better Sourav Ganguly is an insult to a great player like him, who has made over 15,000 runs in international cricket. Every player, even Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, has had lean patches when they didnt get runs. Unfortunately, Ganguly, along with his bad performance, was a victim of internal politics. 

 Biswajit Ganguly,

 Sourav Gangulys performance and leadership qualities can never be questioned. Whenever he has got a chance to represent his national or state team, he has performed superbly. This was proved in South Africa and recently against the West Indies. His comeback has been quite dramatic. His fans have been waiting for this for over 16 months. He has proved that the team needs him.

 Elvis Robin, 

 Address not given

 Sourav Ganguly was a victim of politics between Jagmohan Dalmiya and Sharad Pawar. Greg Chappell cashed in on it. Sourav Ganguly has always been a good player. His problem was his form. After he was kicked out, the Indian team lost the killer instinct and the zeal to win matches. 

 Raju Sharma,

 Bijoy Bose Road

 Sourav Ganguly has made a spectacular return to Team India. His 16-month exile was a blessing in disguise helping him rediscover his batting skills. He has shown that nothing is impossible, if one is determined and patient.

 Ranadip Ganguly,

 Diamond Park

 Souravs 16-month exile has made him a better player. He will show his class in the forthcoming World Cup. 

Rahul Roy,

 Nagerbazar

 Sourav Gangulys exclusion from the national squad was a boon for him. It actually helped him rediscover himself as a finer cricketer. And he has proved his mettle, first in South Africa and then against West Indies.

 Rudranil Bag, 

 Hooghly

 We cannot conclude that Sourav has returned a better player. He was going through a bad phase in which he was not getting runs. Even Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara and Sanath Jayasuriya have faced such situations. In the past few months, he has played a good amount of domestic cricket as well as county cricket. This has helped him in getting back his lost form. But he is the same Prince of Calcutta and the same Dada.

Vinay Shrestha,

 Salkia, Howrah 

 Dada is one of the greatest captains India has produced. His confidence was put to test by selectors and his enemies. He rubbished all allegations and came back with a bang. All young players should learn from his determination and hard work.

 Rita Mukherjee,

 Dum Dum

 Sourav Ganguly is one of the finest players in the Indian team. His batting had suffered because of the pressures of captaincy. He was tense about the team and its performance. Now he is free and I hope he will perform superbly in the World Cup.

P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur Avenue

 It is unwise to assess whether Sourav has become a better player than before. Let him establish his credibility by consistent performance. Let him prove that he is dependable. Team India really needs a dependable leader for the forthcoming World Cup. 

T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge

 Sourav Ganguly, better known as desher gaurab, has returned a determined and polished cricketer. And he has proved that in the matches against the South Africans and the West Indians. The team is also doing very well. 

 Ronita Dutta, 

 Jadavpur

 Sourav Ganguly has come back with a bang. His performance in South Africa and against the West Indies was outstanding. He has come back a better player and is taking his batting and bowling more seriously than in the past. 

Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore

 Sourav Ganguly is the backbone of Indian cricket team. He invested the killer instinct that our players lacked in the team. He was just going through a bad phase. The selectors were very harsh to throw him out. Now, he has proved his mettle with an excellent comeback. 

Rathin Chatterjee,

 Dum Dum

 Greg Chappell wanted to play dirty games and had plans to break the morale of our team. He was successful as Sourav was kicked out. But now, with Dada back, Team India will be on a high and will smash all the teams in the World Cup. 

Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park

 Greg Chappell and Kiran More have got the best lessons of their life. They sidelined Dada and the team suffered. Ganguly has come back with more determination and will power and has proved his mettle. 

Prahlad agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

 Sourav Ganguly was ousted from the team for his bad form. It is too early to say whether his performance is better or worse. 

 Prasenjit Das,

 Jadavpur

 Sourav was always a great player. He has scored more than 15,000 runs. He has come back for good. His motivation and positive attitude will be a boon for the team members.

 Samiran Das,

 Duttapukur

 Sourav Ganguly has come back as a real player. Previously, his batting suffered due to pressures of captaincy. Now, he has proved that he is an outstanding player. Team India will get a major boost with Dadas comeback.

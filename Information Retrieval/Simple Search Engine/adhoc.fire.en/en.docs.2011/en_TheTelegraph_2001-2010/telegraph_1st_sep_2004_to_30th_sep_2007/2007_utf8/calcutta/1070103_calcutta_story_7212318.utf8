 The army is gearing up to punch holes into police claims of soldier excess on the last night of 2006 on Park Street.

 To start with, doubts have been raised about the tease charge levelled against Major Chandra Pratap Singh at the star hotel on Sunday night.

 One account from the Eastern Command said Major Singh was roughed up by four bouncers at the hotel, despite identifying himself as an army officer. Why he was targeted was not explained.

 The hotel security then took Major Singh to Park Street police station in a taxi, claimed army officials. When Captain Mahesh, also of 3rd Madras Regiment, came looking for his senior officer, he was allegedly taken into custody on a trumped-up charge of crossing the road at the wrong place.

 Neither the command nor the commanding officer of the 3rd Madras Regiment was informed. It was Captain Mahesh who rang up his unit headquarters in Salt Lake.

 Following this, Lt Col Pratap Singh and Major Kavi led nine other soldiers in two vehicles to the Park Street police station. But before they could reach, Major Singh was beaten up and put into the lock-up with Captain Mahesh. When the jawans saw the major bruised and behind bars, they were enraged but Lt Col Singh pacified them and asked the policemen to release the two. But the sub-inspector who had allegedly beaten up Major Singh refused, only to relent after a round of phone calls.

 Major Singh stepped out of the lock-up and punched the sub-inspector, sparking the attack on the cops by the jawans.

 Lt Col Singh, however, managed to restore order, sent the two freed officers and all jawans but two back to the Salt Lake barracks, while he and Major Kavi waited to meet senior police officers.

 Vendors foil carjack attempt

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Newspaper vendors and cops came to the aid of a taxi driver when his vehicle was being hijacked near Taratala Bridge on Tuesday morning.

 Sukumar Dhanesh and Avtar Singh boarded Arvind Paswans taxi at Howrah station and asked him to drive to Taratala.

 After crossing the Majherhat bridge, the two asked the driver to take a left turn towards New Alipore. As the driver stopped the car and asked them why they wanted to turn left, the two started beating him up, said deputy commissioner (south) Ajoy Kumar.

 Hearing the drivers cries for help, the newspaper vendor and two constables rushed to the spot. The cops detained the youths.

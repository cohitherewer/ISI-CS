 Bombs greet puja crowd

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 After Wellesley Second Lane on Saturday, it was Chetlas turn to witness a bombing spree on Sunday night.

 A woman was seriously injured late on Sunday when a gang of criminals hurled bombs indiscriminately at a crowd of devotees that had gathered at a temple for Sitala puja, at 113 Chetla Road, off New Alipore.

 This appears to be a desperate attempt by a gang, run by criminals Swapan Kori and Sridhar, to regain lost turf in and around Chetla and Tollygunge, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south). 

 According to residents of the area, the gang members crossed the rail tracks over the Adi Ganga canal, from the Tollygunge end, and started hurling bombs late on Sunday. 

 With the crowd busy with its puja, the first wave of explosions came as shockers. Before the devotees could react, another round of bombings sent everyone scurrying for cover.

 The area is close to a lock gate, where a railway bridge is coming up. The youths, evidently, came from the other side of the railway tracks, from the Jhaldar Math end, and crossed over to hurl their bombs, said a senior officer of Chetla police station. 

 The gang had carefully chosen the day of Sitala puja to make a strong show of its strength in the locality, he added.

 On Monday, cops from Chetla police station arrested two persons. A search has been initiated to track other members of the gang with the help of adjoining police stations, including Tollygunge and New Alipore. 

 We are working on definite clues and more arrests are likely to be made, said deputy commissioner Kumar.

 With Chetla and its adjoining areas witnessing a recent boom in real estate, criminal gangs are keen to make their presence felt in order to make fast bucks from the contractors.

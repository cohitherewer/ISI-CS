The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mercs on the move in this metro

 - First brand show in town to focus on two-door, four-seater model

 ANASUYA BASU

 The Mercedes CL class

 It promises the luxuries of a sedan and the looks of a coupe. And Calcutta is ready for it.

 Powered by growing interest and rising demand, the Mercedes CL class will be launched at The Sonar Kolkata on Saturday in the first-ever DaimlerChrysler brand show in town.

 All Mercedes models will be displayed over two days, but the showstealer will be the CL class. The fourth-generation CL class from the DaimlerChrysler stable is more premium than S class, the companys flagship sedan. The CL 500 bears a price tag of Rs 1.14 crore (ex-showroom Calcutta) and the CL 600, Rs 1.57 crore.

 The S class, launched last October in Calcutta, priced at Rs 77.73 lakh, has sold 10 units and there are four bookings, impressive by any standards, says Hiteswar Singh, CEO, Interkrafts. The sole Merc dealership in town has sold 44 Mercs, plus six bookings, in 2007-08. We are expecting a 15 per cent increase in sales over last year, adds Singh.

 With Merc on the move in this metro, the brand show has been timed to showcase all models with the spotlight firmly on the solitary CL display.

 The newly-launched car is a rare breed of a two-door four-seater with abundant power (388 hp in CL 500 and 517 hp in CL600) generated from a V8 engine in the CL 500 and a V12 engine in the CL600.

 The CL provides the comfort of a sedan with the handling of a sports car, claims a DaimlerChrysler spokesperson from Pune. Touted as a two-door version of the S-class, the coupe has taut distinctive lines merged with large tranquil surfaces. The absence of the B pillar (dividing the windows) gives an uninterrupted sleek curve of the side windows that are fully retractable. The CL has no competitor. It has created an entirely new segment of a two-door four-seater, adds the spokesperson.

 Back in Calcutta, Singh is upbeat about the Merc market. What is significant is the mix of the models sold here five Complete Built-up Units (CBUs), including two M class (SUVs), two SLK class (sports car) and one CLS class (four-door coupe) models, he explains.

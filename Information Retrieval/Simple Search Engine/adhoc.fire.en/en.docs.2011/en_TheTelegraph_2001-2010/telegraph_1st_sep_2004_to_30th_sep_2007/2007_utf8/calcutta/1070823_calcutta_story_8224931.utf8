The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Whisked away at gunpoint

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two pimps were abducted at gunpoint from Madan Street, in central Calcutta, allegedly by four other pimps, on Tuesday night. One of them returned on Wednesday evening.

 The six pimps were driving around central Calcutta in a Tata Sumo with four call girls. The abductors had made the driver go to Creek Row, where they dragged out the two and forced them into a waiting car, before driving away.

 The abductors didnt touch the girls, so it appears that the incident was the fallout of a spat, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner (detective department).

 According to the police, Rishi Srivastav and another youth named Bhaiya rented the Sumo from a travel agent. 

 They picked up two women in front of Jamuna cinema and the other two women from the New Market area. The four abductors joined them near Indian Museum, said an officer of New Market police station, where a complaint was lodged by the driver, Sanjib Pal.

 He said: An altercation broke out between the six pimps. When we reached a bar on Madan Street, one of the four youths took out a firearm and asked me to keep driving. A Qualis was waiting at Creek Row. The four dragged out Rishi and Bhaiya, forced them into the Qualis and sped away.

 According to Kumar, Rishi had been arrested for a theft in the mid-1990s and had become a drug addict after being released. He sneaked into his Bowbazar home on Wednesday evening. The police detained him soon after and were questioning him till late in the night.

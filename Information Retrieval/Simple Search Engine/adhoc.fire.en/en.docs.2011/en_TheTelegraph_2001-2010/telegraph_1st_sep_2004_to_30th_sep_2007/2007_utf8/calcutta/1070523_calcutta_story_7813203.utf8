 Trajectory of Indian art

 Tracing the journey of Indian art from modern to contemporary across recent decades is, perhaps, the ideal way to mark the launch of an art gallery.

Participants: Paritosh Sen, Akbar Padamsee, Bijon Chowdhury, Jogen Chowdhury, Kartick Pyne, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Partha Pratim Deb, Wasim Kapoor, Sanatan Dinda, Bose Krishnamachari, Birendra Pani and Partha Shaw among others.

 Event: Paintings and sculptures by eminent and upcoming Indian artists When: Till May 27; 3 pm - 7.30 pm Where: Gallery Kolkata, 41 Shakespeare Sarani, 2nd floor

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Job and home for blind chess player

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dibakar Pal: Help at hand. Picture by Aranya Sen

 Barely a fortnight ago, Dibakar Pal, a blind orphan who had won several chess championships at the state and national level, had no one to turn to in the city.

 Now, thanks to the city police, the 25-year-old Haldia resident not only has a place to stay, but also has a job. 

 Pal, whose story was published in Metro on March 2, has been appointed instructor in the chess school at the Alipore Bodyguard Lines.

 We were surprised to see his talent. We have appointed him instructor in our chess school to recognise his talent, said Zulfiquar Hassan, joint commissioner (armed police).

 The officers, he added, felt sorry to know that Pal had to borrow a shirt from one of his his neighbours before leaving for a tournament.

 Pal was staying at his elder brothers home, where he said he was feeling neglected. His sense of self-respect prompted him to leave the house on February 24.

 Sepoy Debasish Banerjee spotted him moving around aimlessly in Alipore a week ago and brought him to the barracks.

 Joint commissioner Hassan then called Pal to his office.

 The officer shook hands with me and assured me of help, recalled Pal. Till last week, I had no idea where I would stay. Now, I have a roof over my head and a source of livelihood.

 The youth, who could not afford to go to college despite a 75 per cent score in Madhyamik, will be given token money for tutoring the cops in chess. 

 I will try and save whatever I can. Last month, I could not take part in a championship in Mumbai just because I could not raise Rs 2,500, said Pal.

 He now dreams of going to London this year-end to take part in a tournament. I need at least Rs 80,000... My well-wishers have assured me of financial support.

 Hassan said he would talk to welfare organisations to raise funds for the youth. 

 We dont want his dream to represent India in an international tournament to die because of want of money, he asserted.

 The gang of 10, from diverse backgrounds, gathered at the watering hole on Wednesday night for a common mission. Metro digs into the police file for some details about the gang...

 Nadir: Aged around 24 years, 

 Nadir grew up in the Tiretta Bazar area, and became a bouncer 

 with a bar in Dacres Lane. Has been associated with the 

 gang for some time, ever since its members started visiting 

 the bar for late-night drinking sessions. 

 Deepak Agarwal: A resident 

 of Diamond Harbour Road, he hosted Wednesdays get-together. 

 In his early 20s, the man is involved in women trafficking 

 and has deep pockets. To reclaim a huge amount pending with 

 some Sonagachhi strongmen, Deepak was roping in toughies 

 into his gang. Known in the circuit as a big spender at 

 parties. 

 Sunil Bagaria: This Sambhu 

 Chatterjee Street resident of north Calcutta loves flaunting 

 his 9-mm pistol, which he was carrying when the cops raided 

 the bar. With business interests as diverse as transportation 

 of goods from the Jorasanko area to recovery of bad debts 

 of banks and individuals, the 20-something man was in a 

 hurry to make quick bucks. 

 Selim Hossain: Barely 20, 

 Selim grew up in Narkeldanga North Road honing his skills 

 in extortion and bomb-making. Out on bail after his arrest 

 in a bombing case, Selims skill came in handy for roping 

 in the right men to carry out operations. 

 Mohit Lundia: Son of a 

 Burtola Street businessman, this 25-year-old had links with 

 Selim and came in contact with Deepak barely a fortnight 

 ago.

 Mohammed Nasim: Aged around 

 22 years, Nasim was involved in extortion cases in the Narkeldanga, 

 Maniktala and Phoolbagan areas. Well networked in the world 

 of crime, Nasim is a prize catch for the cops.

 Biz brains going lateral

 - Work experience adds an edge to B-school placements

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 Final placement is barely two months away but the spotlight is on the laterals for students with work experience at Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta.

 So, companies like the Sun Group, TESCO, Arcelor-Mittal, M.H. Alshaya, Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) and Motorola are competing with each other to scoop up the best B-brains for offshore and onshore assignments. 

 The objective of lateral placement is to post students with work experience at levels commensurate with their experience, explained Anindya Sen, dean, programme initiatives, IIM Calcutta.

 As more and more experienced students are joining the institutes flagship postgraduate management programme, laterals is fast becoming the most important event in the B-schools annual roster.

 Over the years, the average work experience of the batch has been steadily increasing This year, around 77 per cent of the batch is eligible for lateral placement, compared to 60 per cent in 2006, said Pradeep Sangatramani, a placement cell representative. 

 The phenomenon conforms to the global trend, as the top B-schools across the world admit students with relevant industry experience 

 Some preference is given to people with work experience. This is primarily because such recruits bring in a lot of domain knowledge, said Siddhartha Mukherjee, vice-president, CTS, a key recruiter from the Joka laterals. 

 Lateral placement for the class of 2007 started in the last week of December and will be over by the second week of February.

 Students with 10 months work experience are eligible to sit for laterals, but different companies use different yardsticks to select students on the basis of nature and duration of previous assignments. The final placement is for the entire batch. 

 Though the institute does not release data with comparisons on salaries offered in the lateral and final placement, laterals are more attractive because of the package and the profile.

 One of our seniors has been offered the post of assistant vice-president in a reputed financial institution this year Generally, salary levels are higher in laterals, said Chandan Ghosh, a placement cell representative.

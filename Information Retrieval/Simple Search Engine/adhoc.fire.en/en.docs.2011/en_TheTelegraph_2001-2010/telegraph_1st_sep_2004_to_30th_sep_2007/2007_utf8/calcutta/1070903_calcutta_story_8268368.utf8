The guardians of the children admitted in the hospital ransacked several departments in protest. The situation was brought under control after police arrived.

 ower went off around 1.30am. M.K. Chatterjee, the medical superintendent of the hospital, said back-up supply from generators had kept emergency services, like the life-support systems, running. CESC was immediately informed, he said. The superintendent, however, admitted that the power cut caused considerable discomfort to the patients and their relatives.

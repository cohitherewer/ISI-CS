 What: Preview of a new whisky from Diageo-Radico Distilleries Private Limited.

 Where: The Oberoi Grand.

 When: Tuesday afternoon.

 Take a sip: Master distiller Peter J. Warren from Scotland has blended a unique whisky that will cater to the Indian palate and will give the customer something well-balanced with a great taste. The product set to launch this quarter will be a mix of Indian grain and scotch. The scotch will come from Scotland and the whisky will have the heritage of Booths (Philip Booth and Company Distillers) behind it. The name of the new blend? Lets keep the suspense going... Its too early to reveal that, smiles Peter.

 Interestingly, Peter was born in a brewery (by accident) and got married in a distillery (by consent). The distiller has also had a long tryst with India. I came to Bangalore to join my father in 1965 and my three children were born there, says Peter. The man with Indian roots and experience looks at the launch as a new doorway that has opened in the market. 

 Peter feels that the future of blending is big in India, the largest whisky-consuming nation. The product will belong to the segment of semi-premium whisky. From barley (the raw material for whisky) to the bottle, from single malt to blended, the distiller feels that consumers are more aware of what they want. 

 Voiceover: Scotch has never been a drink for just the elderly as it is perceived to be. Youngsters, too, can enjoy it. Its all about the way you enjoy your drink, whether you sip it in front of the fireplace or have it with plenty of people around you, Peter signs off.

 Tradition yards

 What: Southern Weaves, a sari exhibition.

 Where: Kanishka, 2/1 Hindusthan Road in Gariahat.

 When: February 1 to 3, between 10.30 am and 8 pm. 

 Take a look: On display is a treasure trove of classic silks from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. You can lay your hands on lovely gadwal cotton and silk saris or make a dash for dressy kanjeevarams or simple Chettinad temple saris. You can also stack your bags with telia saris, woven in ikkat style and dyed in groundnut oil. 

 The colour palette revolves around vibrant hues like ochre, reds, mustard, blue (both turquoise and peacock), pink and more, with traditional motifs like flowers, temples and paisleys adorning the flowing yards. 

 The collection was launched with a percussion performance titled Taal Vadya, featuring Pandit S. Sekhar (mridangam), Subrata Manna (tabla), Somenath Roy (ghatam) and Gopa Kumar (chenda).

 Pocket pinch: The saris range between Rs 2,750 and Rs 20,000.

 Voiceover: This collection, put together over a span of seven months, showcases indigenous traditions and craftsmanship, says Prateek Raja, director of Kanishka.

 New den

 What: Launch of Indus Valley Express.

 Where: Indus Valley at 53 Syed Amir Ali Avenue, opposite Ice Skating Rink.

 When: Saturday afternoon.

 Take a look: The eating-out address opposite Modern High School for Girls now boasts of a cosy lounge called Indus Valley Express. The dcor of the 20-seater den is a blend of vintage and modern looks. Wooden benches, huge glass panes, fresh ferns, miniature artefacts, glass jars stacked with cereals and flowers complete the look. 

 You can throw birthday bashes and kitty parties or host small conferences at the new nook, which has separate smoking and non-smoking zones. Call at least 24 hours in advance to book for a party.

 The parent restaurant Indus Valley also wears a new look, done up with murals and glass paintings. 

 Pocket pinch: Indus Valley Express can be booked for parties or conferences at the rate of Rs 200 per head (not exceeding 20 heads). 

 Voiceover: I wanted to give Indus Valley Express an informal look yet retain the old-world charm that goes with the Indus Valley name. The new corner will provide great ambience at reasonable prices, says Neerja Nopani, owner of the restaurant.

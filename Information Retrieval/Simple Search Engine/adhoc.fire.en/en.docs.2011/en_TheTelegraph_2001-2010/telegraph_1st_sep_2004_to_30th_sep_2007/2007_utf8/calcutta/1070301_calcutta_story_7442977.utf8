 Celebration of biz spirit on campus

 - 28 institutes take part

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 The stage is set for the Institute for International Management and Technology programme at Raichak

 One does not need a B-school degree to be an entrepreneur. 

 That was the message that came across as 28 educational institutions in the city participated in programmes organised as part of the first Entrepreneurship Week.

 Entrepreneurship Week aims to celebrate the opportunities in India today. It also strives to improve the entrepreneurial culture and climate in the country, said Abhijan Ganguly, consultant of National Entrepreneurship Network, Calcutta, which is organising the programmes across the city. 

 Over 100 academic institutes across India are taking part in the events, along with corporate partners like HSBC, Symphony and Oracle.

 St Xaviers College flagged off the events in India on February 24 with Father Felix Raj, vice-principal of the institution, lighting a lamp. A thousand students pledged support for the programme. 

 The college has planned an industry visit for students and a discussion on the budget. A business plan competition is on the anvil.

 Institute for International Management and Technology organised a programme to celebrate the culture of Bengal in an entrepreneurial way. Bengali songs and dance was followed by a Bengali lunch for 60 guests, who were charged Rs 450 each.

 The students of the college managed 40 per cent operating profit, showing their entrepreneurial talent, stated Ganguly.

 Rajib Chanda, director, National School of Hotel Management Knowledge Campus, launched its entrepreneurship cell, Enterprise First, on the Durgapur campus. The Calcutta campus has lined up a number of management and networking games, which will be held through the week.

 Head of the economics department of Presidency College Prof Amitava Chatterjee launched the Presidency Entrepreneurs Club on February 24. The college will be organising idea-generation sessions, where the students will have to chalk out business plans.

 On February 24, Heritage Institute of Technology organised an idea-generation session with 150 participants.

 Students of Eastern Institute for Integrated Learning in Management and St Xaviers College have been selected to participate in the Global Innovation Challenge. Six teams from India will participate in the competition, organised at Stanford University to celebrate Entrepreneurship Week. The competition will involve creating innovative ways of marketing household products, said Ganguly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shekhawat who? The car-stopper

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Till Thursday morning, more than 60 per cent Calcuttans did not know the name of the vice-president of the country. Thanks to the large-scale traffic disruptions, by the evening, a lot of people learnt about Bhairon Singh Shekhawat the hard way. 

 Is there a major problem in the city? asked a man in a car, waiting for over 30 minutes on Thursday evening near the Hazra crossing. 

 A taxi driver replied, Vice-president esechen (The vice-president is here). The executive of the Calcutta-headquartered corporate giant got the answer, but failed to recollect the name of the vice-president of the country. 

 As Shekhawat criss-crossed the city on Thursday, throwing traffic out of gear, Metro commissioned a survey to figure out awareness about the vice-president of India. 

 According to the GFK-Mode survey, over 60 per cent respondents, out of a random sample of 80 people, said they did not know the name of the countrys vice-president. Only 55 per cent of this lot could name Shekhawat as vice-president after they were offered four options. 

 But the days disruptions across the city from VIP Road in the morning to Judges Court Road in the evening raised GK levels.

 We had made all the arrangements to minimise traffic congestion But during VVIP movement, it is difficult to manage, a senior traffic officer of Tollygunge Traffic Guard said in defence. 

 But it happens only in Calcutta. In Delhi, the city of VIPs, jams are over in 10 minutes.

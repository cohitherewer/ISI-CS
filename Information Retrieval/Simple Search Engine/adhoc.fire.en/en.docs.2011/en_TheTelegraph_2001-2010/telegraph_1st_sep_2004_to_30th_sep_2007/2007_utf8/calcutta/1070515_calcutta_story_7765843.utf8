The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Safer, cheaper and better

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 Patients suffering from critical blood ailments, like leukaemia and thalassaemia, can look forward to a safer, cheaper and better form of treatment in the city, claim a team of government researchers.

 Under the conventional treatment, patients suffering from such diseases undergo bone marrow transplants and do not recover fully before six months to a year.

 But the researchers claim that with their alternative method, the patient can go back to normal life alive and kicking, three months from the time of the transplant.

 We wont transplant the entire bone marrow as in conventional bone marrow operations. Our method is to introduce only the stem cells necessary to rectify specific blood-related problems, said Samaresh Chaudhuri, head, department of biochemistry and medical biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine (CSTM).

 He said the CSTM researchers have already conducted trials on animals and humans. The results are very promising. We are now waiting for the approval from the authorities to begin the therapeutic application of the technique, he added.

 The city, at present, does not have the facilities to carry out bone marrow replacements. 

 There is a major problem with conventional bone marrow transplantation, said Chaudhuri. Even after a successful transplantation, the transplanted marrow contains some other cells, which force the recipients body to reject the entire transplanted marrow.

 A traditional transplant costs at least Rs 12 lakh. The entire process is lengthy and can cause serious toxic side effects and other life-threatening complications, said Sharmila Chandra, a haematologist and consultant at the Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Medical College Hospital, Calcutta.

 The CSTM team collects stem cells from umbilical cords of pregnant mothers, with their consent, from Medical College and Hospital.

 During the transplantation, well give the patient only purified and isolated stem cells, after identifying the specific disease affecting the blood, said Chaudhuri.

 This technique will nullify the rejection syndrome in the patients body. As we will give only the required stem cells, no other unnecessary cells remain in the marrow that can trigger the rejection mechanism.

 He claimed that the technique will have no toxic side effect or post-transplantation infection and that the entire process will be as simple as blood transfusion. Lengthy hospitalisation, a must in conventional bone marrow transplantation, will be out of the question in our method.

 The technique, he said, is the fruit of our research spreading over around 14 years. CSTM is the first institution in India that started stem cell research, he pointed out.

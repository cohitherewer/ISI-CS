 Biz team heads for Vietnam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Vietnam can become the next big destination for Bengal business, both in terms of trade and investment, as a delegation from the Bharat Chamber of Commerce (BCC) leaves for the country in August.

 For us, the purpose is to look into the prospects of investment in Vietnam. Trade will, of course, be on our agenda, but it will be of secondary importance, said Ashok Aikat, chairman, global trade standing committee, BCC, while speaking at an interactive session organised by the chamber.

 The 15-member delegation that will visit Vietnam between August 11 and 18 will consist of representatives from the sectors of textiles, steel and mining, housing and information technology.

 The Vietnamese government has expressed keen interest in having India invest in their country, said S.B. Ganguly, chairman, Bengal Initiative.

 They were very upset over the fact that Indias investment in the country is the lowest, even when the two countries have had close relationships, said Ganguly.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who had visited Vietnam recently with a 26-member team, shared his experiences at the session. 

 He pointed out that there was scope for investment and trade between the countries in the area of information technology, pottery and silk, leather goods, tea, restaurants, batteries, agro industry and real estate. We can help them in the marketing of leather products, he added.

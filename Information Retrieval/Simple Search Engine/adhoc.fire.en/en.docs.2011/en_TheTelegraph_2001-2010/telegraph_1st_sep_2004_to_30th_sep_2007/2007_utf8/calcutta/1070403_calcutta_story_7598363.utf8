The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Uneasy calm in war zone

 - AFTER MOB FURY, POLICE IN SOUL-SEARCH

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Charred remains of a public bus and shards of broken glass strewn all around, near-deserted lanes and by-lanes and heavy police presence an uneasy calm prevailed over Watgunge on Monday, as signs of Sunday nights unrest were visible everywhere. 

 Early on Monday, the news of the death of Madan the man accompanying Shakil Ahmed Khan in a taxi on Sunday evening when the duo met with an accident at Hastings reached the area that saw bitter mob-police clashes on Sunday night. 

 Leaving nothing to chance, the count of police pickets along Karl Marx Sarani and its adjoining areas was stepped up. As police patrolled the lanes and bylanes, Watgunge went into a shell, with most traders downing their shutters and mourners visiting Vijay Market, atop which Shakil Ahmed lived.

 On Monday, Shakils body was kept at a mortuary, as his relatives including his elder brother Naseem Khan hurried down from Delhi. The burial will take place on Tuesday, when all the shops and markets will be kept closed.

 We have arrested some people There was a strong surge of emotion last night that possibly led to the outburst. An inquiry has been initiated and necessary steps are being taken, said Rajeev Mishra, deputy commissioner (port). 

 Police arrested nine persons from Bhowanipore, eight from Watgunge and three from the South Port police station area in connection with separate incidents of violence at SSKM Hospital and at Watgunge since Sunday evening. 

 But that was just the official part of it. Police also launched a probe to figure out why the group, which had turned up with the body of Shakil Ahmed at Watgunge police station, suddenly turned violent. 

 On Sunday evening, we discussed various issues with some of the local people. They wanted us to take a few steps regarding traffic management and we agreed. Then, suddenly, a section ran out and soon after, things spun out of control, said a senior officer of the Watgunge police station. 

 From setting a police motorcycle on fire to pelting stones at the men in uniform and attacking the vehicle carrying the officer-in-charge of Watgunge police station to heckling deputy commissioner Mishra the cops are trying to ascertain why the mob went berserk. 

 People even heckled fire services personnel We are probing the case, added the official. 

 But on Monday, Shakils family distanced itself from last nights violent protests and said the trouble-makers, who went on the rampage in the area, were not known to the family. 

 They were people whom we never seen in the past in this locality. Probably, they wanted to cash in on the situation, said Naseem, Shakils brother.

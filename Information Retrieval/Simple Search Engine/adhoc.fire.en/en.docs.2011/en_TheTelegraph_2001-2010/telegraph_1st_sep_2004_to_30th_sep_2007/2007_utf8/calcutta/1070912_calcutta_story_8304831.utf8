 Murder for missing mobile 

 - Mason tortured, killed by developer over theft suspicion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A small-time developer killed a 27-year-old mason after accusing him of stealing his cellphone, late on Monday.

 Raghubir Vajpayees body was found on the EM Bypass, near Kamalgazi, on Tuesday morning, a few hours after he was murdered in Boral, Garia.

 Meghdoot Adhikari and two masons working for him, Shankar Maity and Sajal Bhattacharya, were arrested.

 An officer of Regent Park police station said Adhikari had confessed to the crime. The cellphone is yet to be found.

 Vajpayee was one of the masons hired by Adhikari to construct a building in Garia. Around 9pm on Monday, Vajpayee was summoned by Adhikari and accused of stealing his cellphone.

 The phone had gone missing a few days ago. When Vajpayee denied the charge, Adhikari started beating him up. He was soon joined by Maity and Bhattacharya, the officer said.

 The trio then took Vajpayee inside the building and subjected him to electric shocks. The mason probably died on the spot.

 We heard someone crying out in pain from inside the building, but did not dare venture out in the dark, said a neighbour who did not want to be named.

 After a few minutes, Adhikari called a rickshaw and put a man on it with the help of two other men. I could make out from the way the man was lying limp on the rickshaw that he was not alive, the neighbour added.

 Police later said the body was dumped at a spot on the Bypass some three km from the building under construction. It is also close to the place where Vajpayee had been living with wife Renu. They had married two months ago.

 The body was spotted by morning walkers who alerted the police. Some of them had seen Vajpayee earlier. The masons wife was called to the spot to identify the body.

 A police team picked up Adhikari from his home around noon and then rounded up his partners in crime from Canning, South 24-Parganas.

 Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said: The post-mortem report will help us ascertain how Vajpayee was killed. Construction work at the building has been stopped and a police picket has been posted.

 Residents of the area have been demanding an immediate beef-up of security. Several buildings are coming up in the area. We want the police to take immediate action to tighten security, said Boral resident Shyamal Dutta.

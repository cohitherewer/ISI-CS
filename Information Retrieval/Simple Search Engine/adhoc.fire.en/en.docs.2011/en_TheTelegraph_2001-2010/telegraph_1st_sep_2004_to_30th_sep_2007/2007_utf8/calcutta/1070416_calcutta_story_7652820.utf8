 Oxygen therapy for traffic cops

 Rising pollution and soaring temperatures have prompted the city traffic police to draw up a healthcare package for the sergeants and constables. The prescription includes a daily dose of oxygen and oral rehydration solution (ORS).

 After each eight-hour shift, the traffic policemen will inhale oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes. We have also bought more than 3,000 ORS pouches. Traffic personnel will be given one-litre bottles of the drink twice daily to prevent dehydration, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 Oxygen concentrators, used in hospitals to administer oxygen to patients, have been provided to 10 traffic guard offices.

 As part of the scheme, the traffic department is also distributing ultraviolet ray-resistant sunglasses among its personnel and replacing the old black umbrellas used by them with large white ones.

 White umbrellas will be cooler than the black ones. Buckles will be provided to attach the umbrella with the uniform, so that the hands are free for traffic control. We are trying to find sponsors to maintain a supply of the items. Some banks have shown interest, added Shamim. 

 According to the deputy commissioner, the increase in the pollution level means the cops are exposed to higher amounts of respirable particulate matter (RPM), resulting in respiratory diseases.

 While the national average for RPM, mostly emitted by diesel vehicles, is 60 micrograms per cubic metre, the Calcutta average is 93. In areas like Behala Chowrasta, Shyambazar and Topsia, the RPM count has touched the 100-mark.

 The pollutants are small enough to be inhaled and lodged in the lungs, often causing irreversible damage to the respiratory system. To minimise their effects, we have arranged for doses of oxygen for constables. The sessions will revitalise their system, explained Shamim.

 However, according to doctors, oxygen inhalation does not lessen the pollution-related damage. The harm caused by foul fumes cannot be eliminated, as the pollutants are deposited in the lungs. Oxygen provides temporary relief. It rejuvenates a person who has been exposed to polluting gases for a long time, said Plaban Mukherjee, head of pulmonary diseases at National Medical College and Hospital.

 Lawyer suit on HC graft

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Calcutta High Court administration stands accused of failing to protect lawyers and litigants from harassment during collection of certified copies of orders.

 The allegation has been made by a lawyer of the court, who moved a petition on Wednesday before the division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar.

 The lawyer, Madan Lal, made the chief justice the main respondent in the matter.

 Since the petitioners allegations are against me, the chief justice declined to hear the case and assigned it to the division bench headed by Justice Asim Banerjee. 

 The matter will come up for hearing in a couple of days.

 The petitioner referred to a few instances of corruption and highhandedness of court employees that lawyers and litigants encounter while seeking certified copies of orders.

 Lal claimed that employees extract a handsome amount, many times more than the stipulated fee, from lawyers before handing over certified copies. The lawyers, in turn, realise the amount from their clients.

 Citing an instance of irregularity, Lal referred to an interim order issued by the court in favour of one of his clients on December 12 last year. The court had asked the mandamus department to ready the paper book within eight weeks. On behalf of my client, I had applied for the certified copy of the order on January 2, he recalled.

 Let alone getting the copy, Lal is yet to know the fee for it. I had lodged a complaint with the registrar (administration), but in vain. In the absence of the certified copy, the paper book cannot be prepared and the hearing of the case cannot resume, he alleged.

 In another case, he said, he had applied for the certified copy of the order in mid-2006. It was only in March 2007 that I got to know the fee. The payment was made immediately but I have not yet got the copy. 

 Lal also pleaded for a modification in the Appellate Side Rules to bring about a uniformity in the fee structure for certified copies, which he said would help prevent extortion by employees.

 Lawyer Tapas Bhanja claimed that he had made a similar move in 1993 before Justice Padma Khastagir.

 The judge had asked me to file a report stating the names of employees who were taking bribes. I had submitted the report, but no action was taken, he said.

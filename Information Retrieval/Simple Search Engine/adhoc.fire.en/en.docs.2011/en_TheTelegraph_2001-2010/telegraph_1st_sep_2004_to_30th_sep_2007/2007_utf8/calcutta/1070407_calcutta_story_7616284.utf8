The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tardy cop duo named, probe on

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police have divulged the names of the two officers of Jadavpur police station, who had allegedly refused to attend to accident victim Amit Yadav as he bled to death on Prince Anwar Shah Road on April 3. 

 A departmental inquiry was initiated on Thursday against sub-inspectors Biswanath Ghosh and A. Ghosh, who were on duty at the time the young man was knocked down by a speeding Behala-bound government bus a few metres from the police station.

 However, confusion over the jurisdiction of the two neighbouring police stations Lake and Jadavpur led to a delay in attending to Yadav and his struggle for life ended. He was declared brought dead at MR Bangur Hospital. 

 According to district superintendent of police S.N. Gupta, a team of senior officers, led by D.P. Singh, additional superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), submitted a report on Thursday after a preliminary probe into the incident.

 We will hear out the officers before initiating departmental action against them. The process will take some time but if they are proved guilty, they will be dealt with appropriately, said Gupta. 

 The superintendent added that attending to the sick and injured is part of a policemans job.

 It is important to take exemplary action against the two so that others perform their responsibilities with care. It is not enough to maintain law and order and we need our men to keep up to the expectations of the people, Gupta asserted.

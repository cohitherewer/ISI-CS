 Eighty-six puja committees from the city and its suburbs, including prominent ones like those of Sreebhumi and Adi Ballygunge pujas, have been blacklisted by the state pollution control board for violating noise norms during the last festive season.

 The board has asked police to not permit the committees to organise pujas this year unless they pay a mandatory fine, of Rs 2,000, and submit an undertaking that they will not violate the norms in future.

 While announcing this on Wednesday, state environment minister Sailen Sarkar admitted that noise pollution had gone up in the last festive season, compared to the preceding years. 

 We have prepared the list of violators on the basis of our findings, said the environment secretary and acting state board chairman, M.L. Meena.

 The blacklisted committees did not comply with a board directive asking them to pay the fine. We had hauled up 100 puja committees, of which only 14 paid the fine. About two weeks ago, we directed the police to withhold permission to the blacklisted pujas, stated board member-secretary Debal Roy.

 However, most big pujas on the list including Park Circus, Bosepukur Talbagan and Chaltabagan have started work on their pandals. Big pujas do not care for our permission. They start erecting pandals long before receiving permission, said an officer of Kasba police station when asked about the nearly complete Bosepukur Talbagan pandal in the area under its jurisdiction.

 A puja at Police Abasan in HC Block of Salt Lake, organised by the men in uniform and their families, is also on the blacklist.

 Whats the meaning of having all these nodal officers from the police if an order by the board cannot be implemented? asked an environment department official.

 The environment minister also released a guideline for puja committees. It calls for restricted use of loudspeakers between 6am to 10pm and bans noisy crackers. There are also strictures on plastic bags and trimming of trees. The idols have to be taken out of water after immersion. 

 The senior law officer of the environment department, Biswajit Mukherjee, discussed the details of implementation of the green norms with officials from different municipalities and NGOs.

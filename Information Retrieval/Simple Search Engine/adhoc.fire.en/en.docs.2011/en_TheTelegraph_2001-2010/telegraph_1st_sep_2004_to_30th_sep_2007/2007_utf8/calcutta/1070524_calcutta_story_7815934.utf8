 AMIT ROY IN CANNES

 Raka Dutta savoured her moment of triumph in Cannes as she stood in bright sunshine on the balcony of the Palais des Festivals with the palm tree-lined sweep of the Croisette behind her, far away from her home in Lake Gardens.

 It was a dream come true for the 27-year-old post grad from the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI), whose 28-minute feature without any dialogue, Chinese Whispers, is one of 16 entries in competition in a category called La Selection Cinefondation. These are students the film-makers of the future, observed Sophie Merle, a spokeswoman for the Cinefondation.

 From the balcony, Raka could see the milling crowds on the Croisette and the white yachts bobbing up and down on the azure waters of the Mediterranean. She was at pains to point out that it was not true to say there was no Indian film in competition at Cannes. In fact, this year, hers is the only one.

 Where the Dravids and Tendulkars

 of the cinema world have failed, a junior has succeeded.

 ldquo;I have just completed

 my post-graduation diploma in film direction and screenplay

 writing from SRFTI, rdquo; she

 said. ldquo;It is a three-year course but it takes

 a bit longer. Before that I did my graduation in

 geography from Lady Brabourne. rdquo;

 Chinese

 Whispers is her graduating film. ldquo;It rsquo;s

 about urban life. It rsquo;s fictional. It rsquo;s

 28 minutes on 35mm. And there are no dialogues in

 the film mdash; though the sounds are ambient, rdquo; explained

 Raka. ldquo;There are four characters who come

 from different backgrounds but we mainly see a

 man and a woman who are not related. They pass

 each other every day but they remain strangers.

 They don rsquo;t talk

 to each other. It rsquo;s like you pass someone

 everyday on your way to work and one day you

 don rsquo;t

 find that person mdash; there is some sort of

 connection. rdquo;

 Raka

 had been striving for a Cannes entry since the start. ldquo;For

 the last four years I have been thinking that my

 diploma film will be selected here. rdquo;

 Her

 institute has built up quite a record at Cannes.

 From

 previous SRFTI batches, Tridib Poddar also secured

 a Cannes nomination with Khoj in 2002 and Anirban

 Datta with Tetris last year.

 It

 was not difficult for Raka to get her film financed. ldquo;Our

 institute is under the ministry of information and

 broadcasting so the government provides the funds.

 My airfare was sponsored by the French embassy in

 India, my daily allowance in Cannes is provided by

 my institute and the four-night, five-day accommodation

 provided by the festival. rdquo;

 She

 met the other competitors who came from Finland, France,

 Brazil, Serbia, the US, Argentina, Russia, Israel

 and other countries.

 ldquo;I am very excited about this place. I find this

 to be quite a happening place and for a film-maker

 this place can be really helpful, rdquo; said Raka.

 So

 far, eight people have sought access to her film and

 one has sent a response to Raka rsquo;s mail box with

 the single word: ldquo;Beautiful. rdquo;

 Raka rsquo;s ambition is

 to make a full-length feature,

 possibly without dialogue.

 There

 was cinema in her blood, she conceded. ldquo;A long

 time back my grandfather, Tarit Ghosh, was a lyricist mdash; he

 did music also for 42 and Bhuli Nai, very famous Bengali

 films on Indian Independence. I am a complete movie

 buff, rdquo; smiled Raka.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hungry tide terrain

 It was a trip to the land of mangroves where people worship Bonbibi, the place, approximately 130 km from the city, where civilisation co-exists remarkably with wilderness. 

 Twenty-three students from Calcutta International School, accompanied by three teachers, visited the Sunderbans Tiger Camp in February. Reaching Sonakhali by school bus, we took a launch to our resort in the Sunderbans. It was a five-hour journey.

 It was a two and half day tour, where we took in everything from launch rides into the network of numerous creeks, visiting watchtowers and a even a walk through a village that seemed out of idyllic fancies. Our guide was an interesting man. A poacher, he also used to collect honey. But he stopped it after his uncle was killed by a tiger. He had accompanied his uncle on the fateful day and shared his memory of the incident with us. He had been a teenager when it happened.

 At the bonfire organised at the resort, students performed and played games. One of the attractions of the Sunderbans is the Bonbibir pala (the story of Bonbibi), enacted by local performers. A single show is charged at Rs 1,500.

 We didnt have the luck to spot the Royal Bengal tiger, though. We did see an amazing variety of birds and even a wild boar. Many people are unaware of the fact that dolphins are found in the Sunderbans. They are called Gangetic dolphins or Platanista gangetica. Some of our students claimed to have spotted some of these dolphins, but I could hardly identify them.

 Sunderbans,

 the creeks, mangroves and the Gangetic

 dolphins reminded me of Amitav Ghoshs

 book, The Hungry Tide where

 the author gives a vivid description

 of the land. He talks about life

 in the islands (picture

 above) and the hostile environment.

 We also saw shrines of Bonbibi in the forests there. The mangrove trees with their breathing roots propped up above the soil was a fascinating sight. 

 Our trip to this country was exotic, thrilling and an experience worth cherishing for the rest of our lives.

 World of toons

 In years to come, a career in animation is expected to be a lucrative option. Already a fair number of young people are into the industry. So, if you like to doodle and are thinking of pursuing it professionally, Academy of Animation, Arts and Technology (AAAT) has announced a new global curriculum in animation. Providing training in 2D animation since its inception in 2003, the academy is offering three new courses in digital and 3D animation from this year. A diploma in classical animation for one year, a certificate in entry level animation for a duration of six months and a certificate in digital animation for a duration of six months. The course fee is Rs 95,000 for the year-long courses, and Rs 50,000 for the others.

 The minimum qualification for the courses is a pass mark in Class XII. For the diploma in classical animation and certificate in entry level, one needs to take a drawing exam to enroll. 

 Rajini Mukherjee, head of AAAT, said: Our aim is to provide comprehensive training and create animation professionals who would be well equipped to take on global demands that are now turned towards India. Our students have a strong base, which will be further strengthened with the new digital training. 

 Successful students get chance to work with animation studios Metaphor Studios in Calcutta and 2NZ in Mumbai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hacker hero in cyber saga

Only Connect

Abhijit Gupta

Cyberpunk, here we come. Last weeks Only Connect had featured a totally weird book by William Gibson, but the mans real claim to fame is that he more or less booted the cyberpunk genre into life. This was in 1984, when he wrote a novel called Neuromancer about a console-cowboy, but you already know about that.

First principles: cyberpunk is a portmanteau word = cybernetics + punk, no points for guessing that. Two claimants for the parenthood of the word: the improbably named SF editor Gardner Dozois who popularised it, and SF writer Bruce Bethke who coined the word in his 1980 eponymous short story. The opening lines of the short story are something like this:

 The snoozer went off at seven and I was out of my sleepsack, powered up, and on-line in nanos. Thats as far as I got. Soons I booted and got 

 CRACKERS/BUDDYBOO/8ER

 on the tube I shut down fast. Damn! Rayno had been online before me, like always, and that message meant somebody else had gotten into our Net and that meant trouble by the busload! I couldnt do anything more on term, so I zipped into my jumper, combed my hair, and went downstairs.

 This was in 1980, mind. Someone give the man a biscuit and read the rest of the story at http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/cpunk.htm.

 In this genre, the terms Internet or the worldwide web are conspicuous by their absence instead you have cyberspace, the Wired, the Metaverse or the Matrix. Understandable since much of the stuff was written before the widespread diffusion of the Net.

 Protagonists tend to be hacker types who spend most of their waking hours hardwired to some kind of mainframe. Mostly men or boys, they tend to have no social skills whatsoever but usually find themselves ranged against big business or government. More often than not, they come to a sticky end. The dominant template is Orwells 1984, or Zamyatins We: big brother is watching you through all the surveillance technologies at his disposal, and youd better watch out!

 The setting is usually the near future, with Tokyo a particular favourite. As Gibson outs it: You can see more chronological strata of futuristic design in a Tokyo streetscape than anywhere else in the world. Like successive layers of Tomorrowlands, older ones showing through when the newer ones start to peel. The dcor is black leather-and-chrome, lit by the pearlescent backlight of a mobile set.

 As with much else, there is a now post-cyberpunk manifesto, written in 1998 by Lawrence Person and promptly translated into Portuguese for some obscure reason. It is a short piece and can be read at http://slashdot.org/features/99/10/08/2123255.shtml. It explains why post-cyberpunk is more uplifting and less dystopic than cyberpunk, where the protagonist must necessarily get his ass wasted on page 37 of a 455-page novel. Not any longer, we are told; the future is a country where man and machine will live in harmony. Amen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Air passage minus luggage

 - Passengers on London-Calcutta route complain of bags lost in transit, tedious hours to lodge complaint 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chhaya Ghosh, a 72-year-old cardiac patient with diabetes, was scheduled to take the British Airways (BA) flight from London to Calcutta on July 3 on her way back from the US, where her son lives. She had deposited her luggage and collected the boarding pass at Heathrow. 

 When we were about to proceed for the security check, we were asked to vacate the terminal. After waiting outside for over four hours, it was announced that our flight had been cancelled, she said. 

 When she tried to retrieve her luggage, the airline officials told her that it was not possible to look for the bags then. After an overnight stay at a hotel, Ghoshs son arranged for her return on another airlines flight. 

 In Calcutta, she contacted the local BA office. The officials directed me to the Delhi office. After several phone calls, I have got back one bag. The other is yet to be arrive, she said.

 Ghoshs case is not an exception. Several passengers have landed without their luggage on the London-Calcutta route recently. The last incident occurred on Sunday morning.

 Nupur Chowdhury, one of the 252 people who took the BA flight, found at the conveyor belt that her bags had not arrived in Calcutta. She has come for a wedding and all her dresses are in the missing bags, said one of her relatives.The bags of 59 of her co-passengers are also yet to arrive.

 Mahima Basus experience was worse. She reached Heathrow from the city on an Air-India flight on July 28 without her bags. She received the luggage three days later but some valuables were missing. Moreover, she was made to wait two hours to lodge a complaint.

 The airlines representatives at the airport often behave coldly with those who approach them with problems. They have to wait two to three hours to lodge a complaint, alleged Tarakeswar Singh, the chairman (eastern India) of IATA Travel Agents Association. 

 BA officials denied the charge. Sundays problem was because of a glitch in the baggage tunnel at Heathrow, said an official. Regarding long waits to file a complaint, the explanation is that the process is tedious.

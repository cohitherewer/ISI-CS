The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City on MP tourism radar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Madhya Pradesh has its eyes set on Calcutta as a potential market for tourism.

 Officials of the states tourism board, who were in town for a roadshow, said several projects have been initiated to attract visitors.

 Calcutta is one of the predominant markets. A large number of tourists from the city visit our state each year, said G.S. Chahal, the executive director of Madhya Pradesh Tourism. 

 According to Chahal, West Bengal, along with Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, are being targetted for promoting tourism.

 The Madhya Pradesh tourism board has launched a project to develop towns and other areas along both banks of the Narmada.

 We spent Rs 16 crore for developments along the banks last year and the same amount will be spent this year to beautify an area of 1,200 sq km along the banks and upgrade infrastructure of five major towns, including Jabalpur and Hosangabad, said Chahal.

 The popularity of the Narmada Queen, a cruise operating on the Bargi Dam near Jabalpur, has prompted tourism officials to plan another cruise from September. 

 The cruise will ply over the 80-km stretch between Bargi and Mandla, en route to Kanha National Park. 

 The broad-gauge rail coach restaurant in Bhopal is also a major crowd-puller. We plan to launch another of this kind, said Chahal. 

 According to tourism agents, at least a crore of visitors flock to the states favourite destinations, like Kanha National Park and Tiger Reserve, heritage sites like Khajuraho, Bhimbetka and Sanchi, hill resort at Panchmari, Marble Rocks near Jabalpur and Gwalior fort. Nearly 60 per cent of the visitors are pilgrims. 

 Despite certain infrastructure problems, people love to visit Madhya Pradesh, said actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty. The rough and rugged terrain feels almost like a beautiful movie set, he said.

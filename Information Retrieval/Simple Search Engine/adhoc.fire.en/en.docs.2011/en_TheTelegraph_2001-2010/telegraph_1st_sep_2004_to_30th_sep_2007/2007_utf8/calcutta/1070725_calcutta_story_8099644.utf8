 Impetus to talent hunt

 - Science scholarships

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The interest of the student community in Jagadis Bose National Science Talent Search (JBNSTS), one of the oldest scholarship programmes of the country, had been on the wane, as revealed by the dwindling number of applications.

 To revive the glory, the JBNSTS authorities are reaching out to a wider section of students and also trying to rekindle interest in the study of basic sciences.

 We werent getting the desired number of applications, said Papiya Nandy, the honorary director of JBNSTS, which awards scholarships to first-year undergraduate students studying basic sciences, engineering and medicine.

 To spread awareness about the programme established in 1958 by BC Roy, Jehangir Ghandy and others to mark the birth centenary of Jagadish Chandra Bose the authorities have been visiting colleges in the districts to solicit applications. 

 And the results are showing. Till 2005, we used to receive around 350 applications a year. Last year, the number shot up to 870, said Nandy.

 The department of science and technology (DST) of the Union government and the state government have joined hands in spreading awareness about the scholarship.

 The DST has recently announced 10,000 scholarships of Rs 1 lakh each. The first one per cent of students on the merit list of all board exams, the first 15,000 IIT rank-holders and all JBNSTS and Kishor Vaigyanic Prahotsan Yojana scholars will be eligible for the scholarship, said Nandy.

 To enable more students to apply for the scholarship, the authorities have decided to advance the qualifying exam date. The test used to be held in January, when the candidates were well into their first year of study. This year, the written test will be held on September 23. The last date for submitting applications is August 20, said the honorary director.

 Another area of concern for the JBNSTS authorities is the lack of interest among most meritorious students in studying basic sciences.

 The JBNSTS awards scholarships to 25 students every year. Of them, hardly five or six are from pure sciences, pointed out Nandy.

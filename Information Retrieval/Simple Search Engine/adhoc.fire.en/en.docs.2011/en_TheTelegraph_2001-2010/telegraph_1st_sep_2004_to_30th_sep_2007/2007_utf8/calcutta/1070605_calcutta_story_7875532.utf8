The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Car fume code sought from court

 - State wants guidelines on automobile emission to check air pollution

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The state government will ask the high court to frame guidelines to curb automobile emission, the primary cause of air pollution in the city.

 On Monday, during the hearing of a case related to auto emission, advocate Alok Ghosh told the court that the government wants to submit an affidavit stating its stand on the issue.

 The government is eager to solve the problem. It wants to submit an affidavit stating the difficulties it faces while trying to curb air pollution. The state wants the court to frame guidelines on the matter, said Ghosh. 

 The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice K.J. Sengupta gave the government three weeks to file the affidavit. The hearing will commence after that. 

 Advocate Ghosh told Metro that orders passed by Calcutta High Court had put the government in a dilemma. The state tried to phase out vehicles more than 15 years old but a high court judge did not allow that, the lawyer said.

 When the government issued a notification stating that only Bharat Stage II vehicles would be allowed in the city, the court ruled against it, Ghosh added. Now, we want guidelines from the court.

 The court also asked environmental activist Subhas Dutta, petitioner in the case, to submit orders passed by Bombay High Court while supervising the effort to check auto emission in Mumbai. 

 Dutta had claimed before the court that the high courts or the Supreme Court supervise auto-emission problems in metro cities other than Calcutta.

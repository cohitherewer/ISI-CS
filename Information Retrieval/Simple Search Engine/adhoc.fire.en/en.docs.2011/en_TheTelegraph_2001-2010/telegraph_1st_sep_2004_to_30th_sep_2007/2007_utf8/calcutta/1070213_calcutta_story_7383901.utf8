 Ex-cop in murder net

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A former constable of the State Armed Police was arrested early on Monday for his alleged involvement in the daylight killing of scrap iron trader Kishan Lal Jain in Howrah last month.

 Accused Shankar Mishra was picked up from his sisters house in Kasba, South 24-Parganas. Police suspect Mishra, who worked as a middleman of some scrap iron dealers, had helped the killers identify Jain. The assassins, professional killers from Ranchi, may have been engaged by Jains business rivals, said an officer of Bally police station.

 Mishras arrest is the first breakthrough in the case. We hope the killers will be arrested soon, said Niraj Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (Howrah).

 Immediately after the murder, Mishra left his Abhaynagar residence, in Bally, and took shelter at his sisters home. He even once got himself admitted to a nursing home in south Calcutta to evade arrest.

 Police said Mishra had joined the state force in 1989. He took voluntary retirement in 1994 to join the scrap iron trade. 

 Two motorcycle-borne youths shot Jain, 48, from point-blank range at the crossing of Abhay Guha Road and Girish Ghosh Road, in Bally, on January 23 afternoon. Two bullets were pumped into his head.

 The weapon used by the killers were very sophisticated, said an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department, probing the case.

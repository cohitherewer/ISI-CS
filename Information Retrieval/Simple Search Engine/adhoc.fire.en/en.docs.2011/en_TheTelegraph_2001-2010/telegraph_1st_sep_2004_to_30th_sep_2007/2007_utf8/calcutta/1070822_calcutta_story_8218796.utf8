 Bhojpuri ballads

 In the warm and arid Bhojpuri heartland of Bihar, menfolk are often compelled to leave their homes, families and loved ones behind and wander all over the country in search of a better livelihood. Their lives are bound by rigours of hard labour, combined with loneliness and an acute feeling of desolation and dislocation arising from being detached from their native place. Bideshia, this evenings programme of Bhojpuri folk songs presented by M.K. Singh, Debjyoti Mishra and the group Ae Babua, attempts to reflect the varied moods, sentiments and emotions felt by people living in an alien land (bideshias). With lyrics enriched in texture, rhythm and emotion by an extraordinary fusion of traditional folk music with modern accompaniments, the songs are full of pathos and melancholia, narrating workers heartache poignantly, through delicate nuances of native expression. Hosted by Padatik and Shrachi.

 Event: Bhojpuri folk songs by M.K.Singh and group When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Gyan Manch

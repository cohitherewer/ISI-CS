The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Roads amp; highways set to roll

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will take up next month the projects chalked out by the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Committee (CMPC) to improve the transport infrastructure.

 The projects that will be implemented in the first phase, according to a blueprint submitted by the CMPC to the central government in 2001, include laying and widening of roads. The combined cost will be nearly Rs 4,000 crore. The work will have to be completed by 2025. 

 The public works department, irrigation department and the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority will assist the CMDA. The majority of the funds will come under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. The state government will provide the rest of the money. 

 Arterial roads will be laid in the eastern and southern parts of Calcutta under the project. The roads will include an expressway (from NH34 to Baruipur Road) and Salt Lake Bypass (from EM Bypass to VIP Road).

 Thirty major arterial roads will also be built, according to the plan.

 The chief engineer (traffic and transport) of the CMDA, Debdas Bhattacharya, said the execution of the projects will depend on availability of funds. If theres no disruption in the flow of funds, we hope to finish the entire project on time, he said.

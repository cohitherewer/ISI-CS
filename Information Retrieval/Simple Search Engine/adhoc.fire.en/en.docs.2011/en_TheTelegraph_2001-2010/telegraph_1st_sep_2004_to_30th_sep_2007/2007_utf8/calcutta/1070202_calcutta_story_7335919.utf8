 Culture pill in prisons

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has introduced cultural therapy for the uplift of inmates of correctional homes. The step has been taken to stem a rapid rise in the number of suicide deaths in jails.

 Attention must be paid to the physical and mental well-being of every inmate. But at present, we cannot take care of the mental health of the inmates as we do not have psychiatrists and nurses, stated B.D. Sharma, inspector-general of prisons at a seminar on mental health education in prisons on Thursday.

 To make up for it, we have organised recitation training and jatra workshops at correctional homes across the state, he revealed. 

 Jail officials, too, admitted that more and more inmates are falling prey to depression and other mental disorders. Absence of psychiatrists in correctional homes is a key factor behind the rise in the number of inmates with mind maladies, according to the officials. 

 A plan is afoot to build a hospital and sensitise jail workers as well as police to the condition of inmates suffering from depression. Such inmates are sent to Pavlov Mental Hospital, Park Circus, for treatment. Voluntary organisations and NGOs are also entrusted with their treatment.

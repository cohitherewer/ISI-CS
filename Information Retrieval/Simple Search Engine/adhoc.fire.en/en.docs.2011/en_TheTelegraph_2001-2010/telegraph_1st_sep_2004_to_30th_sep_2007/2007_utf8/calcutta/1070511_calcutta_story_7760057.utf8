 The move will restrict brainy students from coming to our state. In this globalised era, we should give more scope to students across the country. Closing the doors on them will send the wrong signals to big industries planning to invest in our state. To garner more funds, we can ask the examinees to pay extra as test fees. 

Nidhi Poddar,

 If all other states close their boundaries, then where will the huge bulk of students go? The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) can admit a handful of students. What about the others? The state should not block the opportunities for bright students. It should plan out the whole schedule efficiently. That would solve the problem.

Narayan Das,

 The regional level entrance tests for various professional courses are essentially regional. The recent decision of the government to do away with the outstation centres reflects this narrow view. The administrative problems, if any, could have been solved by more efficient handling of the issue. For the high cost of hiring examination centres outside, the government could have charged a greater amount. Brilliant students of other states should always be welcomed at the cost of mediocre local pupils. In addition, the government should concentrate on developing a highly meritorious pool of students rather than scrapping the open-door policy.

 It is a bad decision as it will minimise competition for the local candidates. In fact, good students would get demoralised by the lack of competition.

T.R. Anand,

 No, stopping outside candidates from applying for JEE in Bengal is not correct. Why should outside students be deprived when our students keep applying to colleges in different states? This is indeed a divide-and-rule policy which needs to be condemned. How could the government adopt such a narrow-minded attitude? With India already divided into 23 states and many regions keeping their fingers crossed to get the green signal from the central government, such a step does call for flak. Lets hope that the government rolls back the policy for national weal.

 Yes, I do feel that it was an absolutely correct decision to stop outstation candidates from appearing in the state JEE. It is a highly competitive exam and because of the rising student population of West Bengal and the limited seats available in the affiliated colleges, it remains a dream for many brilliant students to get admission for higher studies. Outstation students were decreasing their chances of getting admission. Thus, it was good to stop outstation students from appearing to the entrance exams.

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala

 It was not wrong. A facility allowed to some imposes responsibility, including financial burden, on others. To hold outstation admission tests, the JEE West Bengal authorities had to take various preparations every year. The new arrangement may have a discouraging effect on some outstation candidates. But they can always come over. As the admission tests are over in a day, they will have to stay here for a short period. To minimise their problems, they may be accommodated in schools which stay closed in April when JEE is held.

Saurish Misra,

 Salt Lake 

 No, I do not agree with the move. There are many students who want to get admitted to colleges or universities here as these have better infrastructure, teaching faculty and great past records. The authorities should not deprive them just because they stay outside the state.

Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 We are within our rights to stop outstation students from taking JEE. Bengal has seen a tremendous increase in population and there is an urge among a huge number of students to make a career in medicine or engineering. So our state will be benefited if all the candidates passing out of medical and engineering colleges are local. There are many states which do not allow outstation centres for JEE.

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 Yes, it was certainly the right decision to stop outstation admission tests for JEE. All competitive examinations should be held only at the home centres so that poor local students who are meritorious can get a better chance to qualify.

 Saumitra Das,

 Ganesh Chandra Avenue

 The measure will affect several thousand students across the country. The engineering courses in state institutes, like Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University, are much in demand all over the country. The state government has no right to deny students from other states the opportunity to study in these institutes.

 Krishna Banerjee,

 Jodhpur Park

 When so many seats are being eaten up by the SC/ST/OBC quota students, what is the need to invite students from other states over? Holding the test outside was an unnecessary expenditure.

 Art, illusion and materialism

 Though they began life in Calcutta, painters Abir Karmakar, Debraj Goswami and Uday Mondal trained at Barodas MS University. CIMA Gallery hosts Reality Bytes, the ongoing exhibition featuring the recent works of these three young artists. Karmakars main concern is depicting flesh in all its materiality and corporeality. His series, In the old-fashioned way, confronts his academic training at Indian Art College with the Baroda University credo. Trained as a printmaker, Goswamis images are decisive. He appropriates slivers from celebrated masterpieces, giving them a twist all his own. As a painter, Mondal could not have been more expressive. At first glance, his paintings look like photographs. Then, the illusion is shattered as the viewer realises that the large swathes of white, orange and yellow on his canvases could not have been there in real life. The play between illusion and reality in his works is indeed enchanting and intriguing.

 Event: Recent works of three young artists When: Till April 12; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: CIMA Gallery, 46 Ashutosh Chowdhury Avenue

 The state government is setting up a training institute for officers of correctional homes to ensure they behave properly with inmates.

 The institute, to come up at Dum Dum Central jail, will provide training to both junior and senior officers. Its main objective will be to impart behavioural tips.

 The officers must be taught how to interact with inmates, said B.D. Sharma, the inspector-general of correctional services.

 He had sought more funds for the purpose in a recent meeting with central government officers, who had come to review the progress of a modernisation programme in the correctional homes of Bengal. 

 The courses offered at the institute will include modules on management, police, law, correctional home procedures and finance. A team of experts will formulate the syllabus.

 According to sources in the correctional services department, the decision to set up the institute was taken after several complaints from inmates about bad treatment by the staff.

 We want to familiarise the officers with all aspects of correctional home administration. This will benefit them in the long run. We even want to send officers abroad to make them aware of the international practices, added Sharma. The planned trips abroad are part of the modernisation programme.

 A team of inmates from the state will soon fly to Delhi for a stage performance, said Sharma. The team comprises 24 convicts, serving life sentences. Two months ago, they had performed Tagores Tasher Desh at Rabindra Sadan.

 The inmates had rehearsed in a prison cell. We have been emphasising on various cultural activities in correctional homes for a long time. Music therapy facilitates cognitive, physical and psycho-social functions, said Sharma.

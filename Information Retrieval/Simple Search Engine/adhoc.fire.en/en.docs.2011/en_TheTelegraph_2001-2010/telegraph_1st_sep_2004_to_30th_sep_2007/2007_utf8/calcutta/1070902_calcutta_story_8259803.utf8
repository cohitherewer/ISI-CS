The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Folk roots in urban nook

 Calcuttan of the week 

 Name: Ratan Khanna (picture beside by Pabitra Das)

 Claim to fame: He is the ektara man at Swabhumi, trying to revive folk music of Bengal. His niche at Swabhumis Karigar Haat, which he calls Sursadhan, has ektaras, dotaras, dugdugis (a small drum), gubgubis (a small drum open at one end) and the croaking frog among other instruments. He can be found singing an old folk number to the accompaniment of one of the instruments during the evenings, something that he calls a demonstration. 

 On song: Dont go by the name. Khanna knows little Punjabi. My French is better than my Punjabi, laughs the English literature graduate from Jaipuria College.

 He is a Punjabi, but born and brought up in Calcutta. The resident of New Town began his forays into the interiors of Bengal when, after college, he became associated with a group of creative young men. We would visit baul melas at different places. That was how my passion for folk music grew. I was interested in music, especially Rabindrasangeet, from my childhood, but never learnt, he says. He is an auto-didact. I would watch the folk musicians closely. 

 He fondly recalls a visit by Salman Rushdie. I sang and played the gubgubi for him. He was so enthralled that he took the instrument with him. 

 Man of many parts: Music is one of his many passions. Khanna runs a little magazine, Ek Akshar, and has attended a workshop in cinematography at Chitrabani. I have toured film festivals, some of them abroad, with my documentary on the lives of Purulia artists who make masks for the Chhou dance. I am now working on a documentary on folk music of Bengal, he says.

 The restrictions of a nine-to-five job are not for Khanna. I worked at an agency for some years, but I prefer being the master of my own time , says the man, who is also shooting rural Bengal for a French organisation. 

 Future: I have two scripts for feature films that I want to direct, says Khanna. I have so much to do I feel young and enthusiastic. I am 18, says Khanna, who is 45-plus.

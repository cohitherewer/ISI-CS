The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On course, corporate camaraderie

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bunny Laxman Singh has been playing the meet for three decades now

 Back in the early 1960s, Richard Duckworth could be seen hitting golf balls in the shade of the Maidan trees in the Theatre Road corner. He imparted golf lessons to keen kids, while perfecting his own swing.

 Duckworth was one of the many expatriate corporate executives alongside the locals for whom the second and third weeks of July were meant to be lived up on the fairways of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), with a vigorous round and endless mugs of beer.

 The British gave us a Merchants Cup in almost every sport, even bridge, but the golf competition, teed off in 1906, remains one of the oldest platforms for corporate camaraderie in the country, says former national champion Bunny Laxman Singh, playing the tournament since 1977.

 Of course, the field has shrunk from 90-plus, six-member teams in the early 1970s to 40-odd, four-member squads at the seventh edition of The Telegraph Cup Golf Competition (July 17-20). But its not because of lack of corporate enthusiasm for the game, its just that so many companies have moved out, says Singh.

 The tournament, however, has retained its charm and is being constantly enriched by new-age sectors, feels Brandon DSouza, the president of Tiger Sports Marketing, which manages the event.

 Of late, we have seen interest in new quarters, like self-owned business enterprises (for instance, ex-Royal captain Ashit Luthras Manpasand Manpower) and big-time realtors like DLF, South City Projects and Unitech, says DSouza.

 Pradeep Sureka of South City Projects agrees if a marketing executive plays golf, it gives him scope for better networking. While Bangalore is set to host the Nasscom IT Open golf meet in December, with nearly 400 techies teeing off, our own Sector V is chipping in as well.

 We have Cognizant in the fray and others are coming on board, says Jaideep Chitlangia, the chairman of the organising committee. His team, Madhya Bharat Papers, the defending champions, will face a stiff challenge from nine-in-a-row winner Williamson Magor.

 From when Geo Henderson amp; Co won the first edition of the meet in Barrackpore till the 80s, the Merchants Cup was more laid-back. We downed a few drinks before teeing off around 8.30am and no one went to work afterwards. Now, we start early and its a touch more grim, smiles Singh.

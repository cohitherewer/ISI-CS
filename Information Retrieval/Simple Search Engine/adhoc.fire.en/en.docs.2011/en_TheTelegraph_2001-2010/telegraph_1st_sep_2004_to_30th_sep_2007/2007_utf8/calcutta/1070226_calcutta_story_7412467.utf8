 More than half the products meant for defence personnel are finding their way into civilian homes. From liquor to consumer durables and groceries a range of goods are available at subsidised rates at defence canteens spread across Calcutta. 

 Due to tax exemptions, the products are 30 to 50 per cent cheaper than in the open market. But it is illegal to buy provisions meant for defence personnel. 

 When my niece got married last year, we procured over 90 per cent of the supplies, including alcohol and electronic goods, from the defence canteens. We ended up saving more than Rs 4 lakh, said a businessman in central Calcutta.

 Alcohol from the army quota, which costs 40-45 per cent less than in the open market, is used for large parties, including New Years eve bashes, claimed the businessman.

 Selling of alcohol meant for defence personnel in the market or for consumption of civilians is an offence. Excise is not levied on these bottles. It is clearly mentioned on the bottles that they are only meant for the consumption of defence personnel, said an excise department official. 

 Civilians only need to know an officer to access defence supplies. There are more than 15 defence canteens in Calcutta. They are divided into dry canteens, which sell groceries and other edible items, wet canteens that sell alcohol and canteens for stationery, clothes and consumer goods.

 The defence officers deny that the goods from the canteen are being sold in the market. Nothing from the defence canteen is being sold to civilians. At least, nothing like that has come to our knowledge, said army spokesperson wing commander R.K. Das. 

 The lower-ranked defence personnel can withdraw a fixed amount of goods. The senior personnel enjoy a very large quota. The officers are provided with a smart card which they have to swipe while buying provisions.

 The dependants of the officers, on producing their cards, can buy everything, except alcohol. If any officer is caught selling defence merchandise outside, his card will be cancelled immediately and action will be initiated against them, said the manager of one of the canteens in Fort William. 

 According to him, officers have been caught in the past selling alcohol outside. When some officers were caught selling groceries from the canteen, we took action against them, added the manager.

 Three newborns crammed into a cot, while two share an oxygen tube the scene that greets a visitor to the states only paediatric referral hospital remains unchanged, even after a series of crib deaths over the past few years.

 The infrastructure crunch at BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children could have eased a lot had the authorities kept their promise of commissioning the new building on the premises by January.

 The new wing is supposed to house two intensive care units and 110 beds. Only a portion of it two of the three general wards has become operational.

 Besides, neither has the number of doctors and nurses been increased, nor has the essential equipment to treat critical babies been procured.

 The state government had allotted Rs 2 crore for constructing the building. 

 Another Rs 1 crore former Indian cricket skipper Sourav Ganguly himself had donated Rs 70 lakh was later allotted for installation of state-of-the-art equipment.

 The hospital has been rocked by crib deaths several times the last in November 2006, when 22 babies died in 72 hours. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had visited the hospital then and announced in the Assembly that the new unit would be operational by January 2007.

 Asked about the delay in commissioning the building, director of health services Sanchita Basak said: We wanted Sourav to attend the inaugural programme, but he was away at the World Cup. Now that he has returned, we are trying to fix a date.

 Hospital superintendent M. Basak admitted that the second floor of the building was not ready. Two wards in the new building are functional now.

 The health department has sanctioned five posts of medical officers and 40 posts of nurses for the hospital. The doctors and nurses are expected to join work in phases, Basak added.

 The three general wards of the building will have 30 beds each, while the neo-natal and paediatric intensive care units will have 10 beds each. The hospital does not have any intensive care unit now, said an official.

 We have requested the health department to expedite the appointment of doctors and nurses, he added.

 The old building has 250 beds, but the number of patients often exceeds 400. Of the beds, 40 are paid and 50 surgical. 

 The rest are often shared by as many as three patients. Between 13,000 and 16,000 patients are admitted to the hospital every year.

 Panel on retaining law seats

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta University on Tuesday set up a three-member committee to explore ways to retain the 240 seats in Surendranath Law College.

 There has been a stalemate at the college for the past two weeks after students, under the banner of Chhatra Bloc (students wing of Forward Bloc), started an agitation against the decision to reduce the number of seats to 120 from this year.

 The decision to set up the committee was taken by the university at a special meeting of its syndicate, its highest policy-making body. The panel has been asked to negotiate with the state government and find a way out of the stalemate, said Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).

 According to the bar council rules, undergraduate law colleges should maintain a teacher-student ratio of 1:40. But Surendranath Law College does not have a single whole-time teacher.

 The committee will also ensure that the college gets at least six full-time teachers as early as possible. We have no problems in retaining the number of seats if the teaching posts are filled up, said Das.

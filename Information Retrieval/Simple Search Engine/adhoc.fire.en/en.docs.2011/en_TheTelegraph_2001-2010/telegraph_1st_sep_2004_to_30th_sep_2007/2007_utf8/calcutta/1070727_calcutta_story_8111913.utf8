 Braveheart homeless in clean-up

 - Salt Lake eviction drive razes shanty of youth shot by fleeing thieves

 SUCHETA CHAKRABORTY

 Siddhartha Shreshtha: Bullets and bulldozer

 Bidhannagar Municipalitys eviction drive along Kestopur canal on Wednesday, to check the robbery spurt in Salt Lake, did not spare the shanty of Siddhartha Bahadur Sreshtha.

 The 20-year-old braveheart was shot in the stomach while chasing two thieves who were fleeing after trying to break into the house of Ram Agarwal, of AB 85, in Salt Lake, on July 14. The cleaner-cum-driver, now rendered homeless, is in hospital fighting bullet injuries.

 The clean-up drive on Thursday was carried out by the municipality and police at the behest of Salt Lake residents, who blame the shanties along the canal for the rising crime graph in the township. It is on residents demand that the eviction drive took place, clarified Biswajiban Majumdar, the chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality.

 Ashok Biswas, the additional superintendent of police (North-24 Parganas), said the eviction drive was a routine municipal affair. We have no knowledge of Siddharthas home being razed. Some of the shanty-dwellers had tried to draw attention to the bravehearts dwelling. We told the authorities that this was Siddharthas house but they did not pay heed, alleged Tapan Adhikary, a rickshaw-puller.

 A fortnight after Siddhartha was the toast of the township, having taken the fight to a gang of robbers, his 55-year-old widowed mother sat alone, huddled under a plastic sheet propped up by a bamboo stick at the eviction site. 

 What could I do? cried Maya Sreshtha, as the skies opened up. Nobody has come forward to help us, not even those for whom my son risked his life. My elder son Sunil is trying desperately to raise the money required for Siddharthas treatment. No one is bothered.

 Maya, a domestic help who came to the area 12 years ago from Habra, has not visited her son in faraway Nilratan Sirkar Medical College. Where will I get the money to go and see how he is recovering? she asked.

 When the municipality chairman heard of this, he said: If the family asks for assistance, we would be glad to help, provided the local residents support his cause.

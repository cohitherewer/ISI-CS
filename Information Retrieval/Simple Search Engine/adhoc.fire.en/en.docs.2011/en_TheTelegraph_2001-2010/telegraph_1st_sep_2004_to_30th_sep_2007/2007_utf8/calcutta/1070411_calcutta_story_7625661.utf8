 A gold hallmarking factory in a congested Burrabazar neighbourhood has the residents up in arms. According to neighbours, GN Hallmarking and Refinery is engaged in melting precious metals, for which it does not have permission, and is posing health hazards.

 The unit is housed in a four-storeyed building at 6 Adi Banstala Lane. It is owned by Shashikant Shinde. The nitric acid used for hallmarking gold is allegedly stored in drums on the fourth floor. The chimney often spews acid fumes, causing pollution. 

 The nitric acid fumes cause breathing trouble among children. The factory is also behind other health hazards, complained Surendra Sharma, who stays in the locality.

 Cooking gas cylinders are also stored in the house. The cylinders are meant for domestic use, but are being used commercially, said another neighbour. 

 We use modern imported machines for soldering. How can anyone say that we stock gas cylinders? countered Shinde. We use measures to check pollution. The allegations are baseless, he added.

 There are hospitals and schools nearby and their authorities have complained about the nitric acid fumes. But most are afraid of taking steps against Shinde, said an official of Bangiya Swarna Shilpa Samity of Burrabazar.

 Shinde had permission to set up a G+2 structure. He constructed the third floor illegally. The concrete roof was covered with asbestos, complained Kamal Kadel, who has an office on the first floor of the building. 

 The tenants of the house and the neighbours have submitted complaints at the mayors and the executive engineers office. On Tuesday, executive engineer Tushar Dasgupta denied that there was any illegal construction in the building.

 The local residents had submitted a petition to the state pollution control board in February. Deepak Chakraborty, chief scientist and head of the technical cell of the board, said: Once we receive the complaint from the regional office, we will take the necessary action after inquiry.

 The factory does not have the required permissions. Otherwise, it would not have stopped work for a week after a joint petition to police early this year, pointed out Rajesh Sinha, general secretary of the state Youth Congress. 

 The neighbours have also submitted complaints to Posta police station and deputy commissioner of police (central) Ajay Ranade. Both Ranade and the officer-in-charge of Posta police station denied comment.

 - Software 

 to bridge knowledge gap 

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 Students can bunk tutorials and cheat teachers, but they cannot ignore CLEaRS.

 CLEaRs (Computerised Learning, Evaluation and Review System) is a patent-pending educational software launched by Learning Accord. The software is designed to address the knowledge requirements of a student and evaluate his academic progress.

 A number of educational institutions, like Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission School, Don Bosco, Kendriya Vidyalaya and MP Birla School, have opted for the software and are promoting it as a learning supplement for students.

 Students attend the same classes and study the same books, but a few do better than the others. The problem is about uneven learning. In conventional learning systems, individual knowledge gaps go unattended, as one teacher looks after a large number of students in a class. CLEaRS identifies these gaps and addresses them, explained Shyamal Sarkar, CEO of Learning Accord.

 The idea was conceived by Shyamal Sarkar, an NRI businessman, who worked with a team of professors to develop a software based on the concept of private teacher to address individual knowledge gaps.

 CLEaRS was launched in the US and mainly catered to MCAT students. It has been modified to meet the needs of the students here and has been launched in the city for the first time in India.

 The software covers five science subjects physics, chemistry, math, botany and zoology. It prepares students for the 11th and 12th board exams and also for the entrance exams. 

 Students have to load the software in their computers. Then they have to specify the exams they are appearing for. The software prepares a study plan and then evaluates the progress of the student, explained Nirmalya Gupta, area manager, Learning Accord.

 CLEaRS contains five interactive modes two learning modes (nurture mode and the concept mode), two evaluation modes (auto mode and filter mode) and a simulated exam mode. All the modes are interconnected and the performance in each mode is taken into consideration during evaluation.

 The text content of CLEaRS is broken up into chapters, topics and sub-topics. It is equivalent to 25 textbooks and has 61,000 multiple-choice questions, 8,000 images and diagrams and 113 animations.

 The software, like a private tutor, evaluates a student by asking questions and awarding marks. The questions get harder as the student clears the levels and also adjusts the questions as per the students requirement. 

 Currently, around 2,000 copies of the software, priced at Rs 3,000, are in use in the state. It is available at the companys office on Chittaranjan Avenue.

 Factory rob gang in cop net

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 The key members of a city-based gang behind at least 15 factory robberies in Calcutta and the adjoining districts over the past five months have been arrested. 

 The last arrest was carried out on Tuesday. Bapi Mandal, 28, and Jagannath Banerjee, 26, two leaders of the gang that had looted goods worth about Rs 50 lakh, are among those held.

 At least 50 people have been arrested. We are on the lookout for some other members of the gang, said superintendent of Howrah police Neeraj Kumar Singh. 

 The gang had robbed factories on the citys fringes, Murshidabad, Hooghly, Howrah, Nadia and Burdwan. At least four of the robberies were carried out in Howrah.The spate of robberies had forced police to set up a Special Task Force (STF), comprising 10 officers. 

 Mandal and Banerjee employed five experts who specialised in breaking locks, handling arms and other such tasks. They comprised the core of the gang. These members hired criminals for short-term operations. Most of the recruits are from Murshidabad.

 The gang would identify a factory and keep an eye on it for a few days. They would then lay siege in a truck one night, overpower the guards and enter the factory. They stayed inside for hours. On occasion, the gang members even cooked a meal during a raid, stated an STF officer.

 By the time they left, there would hardly be anything of value left. The robbers targeted iron and chemical factories, added the officer.

 According to police, the gang used to hand over the loot to a receiver, identified as Dilip Jaiswal, who lives in Teghoria. Jaiswal allegedly sold the booty to a Maniktala resident, who is yet to be identified.

 The three-day extravaganza a one-stop matrimonial solution will be held from September 21 to 23 at Hyatt Regency.

 A matrimonial exhibition on such a scale will reach out to people in great numbers.

 With all plan-a-wedding requirements under an umbrella, the exhibition will surely generate a lot of excitement. People from near and far come wedding-shopping in Calcutta. The city deserves and needs an exhibition like this, said Sharbari Datta.

 Wedding wows will merge with vital marriage mechanics at the exhibition.

 Clash over college elections

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Supporters of the Students Federation of India (SFI) and Chhatra Parishad clashed outside South City College on Monday afternoon over the forthcoming students union elections. The two groups pelted stones at each other for more than 30 minutes.

 A Chhatra Parishad supporter sustained injuries on the head during the clash. The SFI supporters later put up a blockade at Gol Park for half an hour from 3.15 pm, demanding immediate arrest of the Chhatra Parishad supporters who had allegedly attacked them.

 According to police, the clash started around 2 pm, when a group of Chhatra Parishad supporters went to the college to file nominations for the students union elections, scheduled to be held on April 5.

 The trouble broke out in the college when the supporters started scuffling with each other, said deputy commissioner of police (south division) Ajay Kumar.

 The situation worsened after the groups came out of the college. They were joined by other supporters, most of them outsiders. The groups attacked each other, said an officer.

 The Chhatra Parishad supporters alleged that most of the SFI supporters were not students of the college. They chased us and beat us up. One of our supporters was hit on the head by a stone thrown by the SFI youths, said a Chhatra Parishad supporter.

 The Chhatra Parishad supporters were not allowing us to pick up the nomination forms. They prevented our candidates from entering the room in which the forms were being distributed. As a result, trouble broke out, claimed an SFI supporter.

 Police are investigating the incident.

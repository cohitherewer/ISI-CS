The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 They all dial him in distress

 - L.K. Mishras job is to keep every VIP phone ringing, 24x7

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Crisis One: The telephone line at chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Palm Avenue residence is suddenly disconnected. The OC (telephone) gets an SOS at night. He pulls BSNL strings and the line is restored. The bill is paid the next morning.

 Crisis Two: An IPS officers residence telephone goes dead. The OC (telephone) is woken up at midnight. He pulls BSNL strings, a team of engineers is despatched, the cable fault is repaired and the connection restored at dawn.

 Lakshmi Kanta Mishras telephone never stops ringing. For his task is to keep all telephones of Calcutta police, the chief minister, top ministers and bureaucrats ringing. It is very hectic, but I enjoy my work. Everybody is happy with my performance, smiles Mishra, officer-in-charge (telephone) of the city police for the past four years.

 From immediate restoration of VIP telephone connections to keeping track of telephone bills for 48 police stations, Lalbazar and the residences of all senior officers it all comes with the job. Mishra is the best man for the job. Everyone likes him for his sincerity, says an IPS officer.

 No wonder Mishra is the longest-serving OC (telephone) in the force. Having joined the force in 1979 as a traffic sergeant, he went on to become an instructor at the Police Training School. But it is as OC (telephone) that Mishra has built up quite a reputation.

 It is through his efforts that Calcutta police saves Rs 60 lakh every month, points out a senior officer. The monthly telephone bill at each police station has come down from Rs 8,000-9,000 to Rs 3,000-3,500, thanks to Mishras initiative in reaching the right agreements with BSNL.

 Seated in his third-floor office at Lalbazar, Mishra remains unflappable despite the incessant ring of his phone. Since I have been in this chair for many years, all senior officials call me whenever they have a problem with their telephones... I am on call round-the clock and they all give me due recognition for my work, he smiles.

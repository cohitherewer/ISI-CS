The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Figure hunt in test scam

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The medical entrance racket was active last year, too.

 Police said on Monday that the racket had fielded dummy examinees, students of various medical colleges, in place of genuine candidates in a medical admission test in 2006.

 The sleuths, however, are still in the dark about the number of students who have gained admission to medical colleges through the racket.

 Only two such students have been identified Kumar Singha Roy, who has been arrested, and Rupa Majumder, an Allahabad resident. A police team visited Rupas house, but had to return empty-handed.

 The racket trapped candidates by cashing in on its success stories, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (I), detective department. There are reasons to believe that the racket had fielded dummies in the postgraduate entrance test in Bangalore in 2006.

 The sleuths have come across a Patna link in the racket. Mihir Jha, a prime accused, ran a centre each in Calcutta and Patna that were allegedly involved in the racket. Jha, a resident of Patna, is a radiology student at SSKM Hospital.

 He also maintained support staff in Bangalore, who would attend to the dummies from Calcutta, said an officer.

 Jhas Patna roots brought him close to Ranvijay Pathak, a resident of that city, who is now a final-year MBBS student at Medical College. Pathak was subsequently drafted into the racket, but he later opened his own institute near Minto Park.

 On Monday, around 25 students from Medical College met deputy commissioner Kumar and submitted a complaint against Ranvijay and Ayan Mukhopadhyay, another alleged member of the racket.

 The sleuths claimed that the racket flourished ever since the JEE format switched to the multiple-choice question pattern.

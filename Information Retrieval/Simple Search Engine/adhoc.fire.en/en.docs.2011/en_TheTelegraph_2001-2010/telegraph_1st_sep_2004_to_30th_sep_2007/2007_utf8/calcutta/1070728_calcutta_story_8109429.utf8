The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Knowledge group for mega city march

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The first secretariat of the Mega City Association, formed under the aegis of the central government, was set up on the second floor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters on Thursday.

 The association, comprising civic managers of seven mega cities of the country, will act as a knowledge group for implementation of development schemes under the Centres Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

 Apart from Calcutta, the member-cities are Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore. Each has a population of more than four million and has been declared a mega city.

 While the mega cities will be core members, those that have not yet been accorded the status but have attained or are nearing the population benchmark will also be inducted into the group.

 The association was conceived after the authorities felt the need for closer cooperation among the Centre and the civic authorities for improving the quality of life in the mega cities, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandopadhyay.

 The Union urban development minister, Jaipal Reddy, is chief patron of the association, while the seven mayors will function as patrons. The municipal commissioners of Mumbai and Calcutta have been appointed president and joint secretary, respectively. Two programme managers have already been recruited.

 We have allotted a room for the secretariat office of the MCA at the CMC headquarters. The office, however, could be shifted if we could find a better location, said Bandopadhyay. The first meeting of the association will be held in Calcutta on August 10. 

 To set up an initial corpus, each of the seven municipal corporations has shelled out Rs 10 lakh.

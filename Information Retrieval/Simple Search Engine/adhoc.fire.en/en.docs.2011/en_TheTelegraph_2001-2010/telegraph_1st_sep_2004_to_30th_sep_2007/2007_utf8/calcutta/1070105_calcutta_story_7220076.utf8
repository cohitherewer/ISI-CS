 A Thought For Food

 What: A new menu at Dum Pukht, ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 When: January 5 onwards, 7 pm to 11.45 pm.

 Big bite: The New Year celebrations carry on at the star address as the exclusive dinner restaurant Dum Pukht gets a menu makeover. 

 The list has been revamped and engineered keeping in mind the special tastes of its elite clientele. 

 At Dum Pukht, you can enjoy a meal in a stylistic ambience, complete with new crockery and glassware to complement the new fashionable look.

 The ancient tradition of dum cooking is a detailed process where large cauldrons are filled with rice, meat, vegetables and spices and then sealed to make a complete meal. When the cauldron is opened, the first whiff of the rice is magically intoxicating. 

 At Dum Pukht, experience the ancient tradition of cooking using a round, heavy bottom pot or handi, in which food is tightly sealed, roasted, matured and cooked over a slow flame.

 Dum Pukht will also focus on a more authentic style of service. If you call Dum Pukht, you will hear an adaab greeting, smiles Dhruv Chanana, assistant manager, food and beverage.

 Following valuable customer feedback, a new dish called Dora Kebab will be prepared alongside the popular Kakori Kebab that is served at the restaurant.

 For starters, the chefs recommends kebabs like Dora Kebab, Dum Ki Trout, Hara Kebab Dum Pukht and Mirchi Ke Kebab. 

 Move on to the main course with delicacies like Murgh Handi, Ghosht Nihari, Kundan Quallyan (boneless chicken cooked in brown, onion or saffron base), Rann-e-Dum Pukht for non-vegetarians and Paneer Quallyan (cottage cheese in brown onion gravy), Dum Ki Khumb (a mushroom delicacy) and Subz Miloni.

 Team these with Rogani Roti, Naan-e-Backmuach and Paradar Paratha.

 End on a sweet note with Jaan-e-Azam and Chhena Payesh.

 Pocket pinch: An average meal for two would come for Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000. 

 Voiceover: We wanted to give the Calcutta crowd traditional Awadhi cuisine that is hard to find elsewhere. Keeping this in mind, we have done away with the other cuisines that were on offer and decided to focus on Awadhi and dum-cooked food only, says Manoj Aswal, junior sous chef, Dum Pukht.

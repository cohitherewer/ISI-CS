The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Timeout

 Calcutta canvas

 Embarking on her journey into the world of art at the astonishingly tender age of three, Ekta Singha is today considered one of the foremost upcoming talents from Bengal. Recipient of the Presidents Award along with several national and international recognitions, she has already displayed extraordinary depth, diversity and maturity in her works. The ongoing exhibition showcases 30 watercolours and acrylic paintings by the teenage artist. Mainly depicting images of Calcutta and its surroundings, she has portrayed the environment that has nourished and nurtured her creative spirit with a sensitivity and grace rare in one so young. Her paintings bring to life the glorious achievements of modern urbanisation as well as the dying traditions of a bustling metropolis. The series on rickshaw-pullers brings forth the suffering, despair and darkness in their lives, at the same time beautifully bringing alive the nostalgic charm of vintage Calcutta.

 Event: Solo exhibition of paintings by Ekta Singha When: Till July 1; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Gallery Exposure, 54B Mahanirban Road

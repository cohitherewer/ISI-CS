The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sit and sip, but is it safe?

 - Shootout underscores degeneration of office-para watering holes

 ZEESHAN JAWED AND PRONAB MONDAL

 Blood spilled at a central Calcutta watering hole on Saturday night when a man fired gunshots at an employee of Bower Bar for denying him a drink after closing time.

 While police are still looking for the unknown assailant and waiter Sanjay Paswan is recuperating in a hospital, questions are being raised on safety at the citys dark and smoky watering holes.

 I was a regular at these bars after work But the environment at the bars has changed and I prefer a drink at home these days, said Subhasish Banerjee, a middle-aged businessman.

 Banerjee and many like him have drifted from the bars and a new set of clientele has taken over these watering holes, which serve alcohol at competitive rates and also offer live music performance. The total number of bars in the city is more than 200 (see box). 

 No bar in central Calcutta can survive without a live band. The bands not only ensure entertainment of the customers but also ensure clients, who come to the bar to enjoy the music of that particular band. We are only surviving on the singers guest, said an official of Hotel Minerva, at 11 Ganesh Chandra Avenue, a stones throw from Bower Bar. 

 But the bar owners admit that though the change in the profile of patrons has increased cash flow, their problems have compounded scuffling, jostling and fisticuffs have become a regular event at these watering holes.

 The live band and reduction in prices of alcohol are drawing wrong elements Most of these people are snatchers and petty criminals. They create a lot of trouble, said an employee of May Fair Bar and Restaurant, at 25A Chittaranjan Avenue.

 Doing away with music is not possible, as the soirees draw in footfall and allow these low-priced watering holes to compete with their upmarket counterparts on Park Street.

 The beginners batch from decent families does not come any more The young generation has high disposable income and better options. They frequent the nightclubs, said Prashant Kumar Shah, owner of Sovereign Bar, on Prinsep Street, explaining how customer profile has degenerated down the years in these office-para bars.

 As Hindi music live is the demand from these customers, most bars have got themselves crooner licences from Calcutta Police to hold soirees in the room where customers sit and sip. 

 A licence is issued from the office of the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) with a lot of dos and donts. The fact that most of these bars employ dancers to woo customers reveals that police surveillance is slack.

 Dance performances are strictly prohibited. Everyone on the dais has to be a singer and the clients are not allowed to dance. Singers can only match steps and move hands to a minimum extent and according to the rhythm of the song.

 We issue licences after carrying out a proper investigation. After Saturday nights incident, we have formed a team of plainclothes sleuths, who will keep a vigil on these live music bars, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee.

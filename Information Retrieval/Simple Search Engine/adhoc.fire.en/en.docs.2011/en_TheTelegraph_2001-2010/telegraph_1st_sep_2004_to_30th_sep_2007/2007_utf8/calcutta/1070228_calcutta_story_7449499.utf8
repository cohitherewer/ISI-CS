 In a late night strike on Monday, a group of youths broke into a decade-old Shiva temple on Bagmari Road, in north Calcutta, and looted ornaments and accessories worth Rs 1 lakh.

 Two youths were arrested early on Tuesday for their alleged involvement in the robbery. A case has been initiated and officers of Maniktala police station have started interrogating the duo.

 Teams from the detective and forensic departments also visited the spot.

 We could never imagine that anyone could rob this temple. We managed to trace two of the thieves, who have been handed over to police, said Subir Kumar Mondal, a temple committee member.

 Local residents said the theft was noticed by a local trader, Sanat Ghosh, around 4.45 in the morning.

 He found the temples rear gate open and the locks under a tree nearby. 

 A three-kg silver snake, a silver throne, and a nose, eyes, and bindi all made of gold were missing, said temple priest Deepak Bhattacharya.

 In the morning, when I entered the temple, flowers and garlands were scattered all over and the ornaments and some cash were missing. The thieves tried to enter through the main gate but could not break the locks. They then broke the rear gate and entered the temple, said Bhattacharya.

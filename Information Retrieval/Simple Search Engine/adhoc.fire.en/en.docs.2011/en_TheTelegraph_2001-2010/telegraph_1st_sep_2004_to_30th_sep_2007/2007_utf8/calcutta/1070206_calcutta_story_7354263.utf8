 Throat slit, tourist tossed out of taxi

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A profusely-bleeding French tourist was found lying on Sudder Street on Sunday night. He had been thrown off a taxi around midnight, said local residents.

 Doctors at Assembly of God Church Hospital, where the injured man was admitted, said his throat had been slit and there were multiple injuries on the body, probably inflicted with a razor.

 The tourist, identified as Chimgainy Yoan, had checked into a Sudder Street hotel on Saturday. His wife, Caillon Nayyma, who had travelled to the city with him, had checked into a separate hotel on the same street.

 We are trying to find out why the two were staying in separate hotels, said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee.

 An officer of New Market police station, who spoke to Yoans wife, stated: She told me that her husband was addicted to drugs and hence, she had put up in a separate hotel.

 According to another officer of the police station, around Sunday midnight, local residents saw a taxi halt near the hotel where Yoan was staying.

 They noticed someone open the left rear door and throw out the tourist. The residents rushed to the spot and saw blood oozing out of Yoans wounds. Guests at the hotel identified him, the officer added.

 Police suspect that Yoan was a victim of snatching.

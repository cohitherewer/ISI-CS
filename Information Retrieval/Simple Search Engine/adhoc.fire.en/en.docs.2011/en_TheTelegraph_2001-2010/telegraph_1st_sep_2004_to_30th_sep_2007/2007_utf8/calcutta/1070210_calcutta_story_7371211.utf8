 The Indian Research Institute for Integrated Medicine, in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, plans to launch a software for tongue diagnosis.

 Tongue diagnosis is a traditional, non-invasive procedure for detecting ailments. Doctors say the tip of the tongue can assess the condition of a patients heart, lungs, stomach, liver and other organs.

 The tongue is the index of our body. We can easily assess the structural and functional status of different body organs by looking at the tongue. With the software, we will click images of the tongue that would help in treatment. You dont have to go through different tests, explains Debasis Bakshi, institute director, who is working on the software with Prabir Kumar Biswas of IIT Kharagpur.

 Tongue diagnosis is a cost-effective, easily-accessible alternative of contemporary medical treatments without any side-effects, Bakshi claims. 

 We are working on lifestyle diseases, like hypertension and peptic ulcers. At present, most professionals are suffering from such diseases due to higher intake of junk food and odd hours of work. We will conduct a study and then do a comparative analysis, Bakshi adds. 

 The software will be launched in 2009. The advanced technology of computerised digital photography and image processing is the biggest advantage for us. We are trying to bring in the software in two years. We will start marketing the software after we get a nod from the government, says Bakshi.

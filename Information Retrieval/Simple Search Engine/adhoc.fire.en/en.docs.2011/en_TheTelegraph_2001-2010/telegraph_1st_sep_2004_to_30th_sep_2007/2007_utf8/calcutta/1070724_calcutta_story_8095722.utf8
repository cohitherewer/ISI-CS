 Job skills for college folk

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Non-employability of thousands of engineering graduates from Bengal colleges and the subsequent shortage of skilled manpower, especially in the IT sector, has prompted the oldest chamber of commerce to make an effort to bridge the gap.

 Several institutes have already introduced training programmes for graduates and fresh recruits.

 To supplement the programmes and meet industry requirements, the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) has set up a wing that will provide training to students from various colleges and also offer them placement opportunities.

 The IT industry is buoyant, with the demand for employees outstripping the supply by three times. The companies are forced to recruit non-technical people, who need to be trained in technical skills. Training in soft skills has also become crucial because the employees have to work in teams and deal with clients from across the world, said Sandeep Mukherjee, of People Power, a city-based HR firm.

 The BCCIs training and placement wing, working with the chambers IT sub-committee and ALB Consultancy, has prepared a curriculum for students interested in IT and ITES, knowledge processing and outsourcing and BPO sectors.

 We will start with IT. Based on the success, we would like to extend it to other sectors, said Khokan Mookerji, the BCCI secretary-general. 

 The duration and the cost of the programme will depend on the requirement of the students, said chamber president S. Radhakrishnan.

 The chamber has approached around 30 engineering colleges across the state, including the National Institutes of Technology, Jadavpur University and Besu, seeking participation of students. Some non-engineering colleges, including St Xaviers, that offer computer-based courses have also been approached.

 The chamber will also invite companies to recruit students from participating colleges. The training and placement wing will conduct the initial screenings. The recruiters will be able to choose the best candidates from at least 10-15 colleges, said Kumar Shivam, director, ALB Consultancy.

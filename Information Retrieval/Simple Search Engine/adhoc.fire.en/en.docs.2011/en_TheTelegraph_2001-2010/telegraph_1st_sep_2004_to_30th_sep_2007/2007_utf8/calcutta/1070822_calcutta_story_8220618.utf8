 Hired killer netted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bijoy Bahadur Singh, 23, alias Badal, was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the murder of 54-year-old lawyer Shyama Prasad Roy in his flat in the Lake Market area.

 Badal is one of the five hired killers who entered the flat on August 14, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police(south).

 A resident of Liluah, Badal had taken shelter in a single-room flat in Howrah after the killing. He was arrested there early on Tuesday.

 Three people had been arrested on Monday in connection with the murder. We are on the lookout for five other members of the gang, including kingpin Sanjay. Badal was promised 10 per cent of the booty, added Shamim.

 The men had allegedly taken away a ring that Roy used to claim was worth a crore. The police have raided Sanjays hideouts in Howrah and Asansol but could not trace him. The ring is with him. They had decided to sell it and take their cuts. We have alerted the police in the districts, said an investigator.

 He added: Badal was a key member of the gang. He and the four other hired killers were from Bihar.

 On Monday, a missionary school-educated young man named Amlan Dutta, the son of a retired sub-inspector and a driver were held for the murder.

 Dutta told the investigators that it was Badal who had throttled the lawyer. We have to verify the statement. The case will be solved only after the arrest of the kingpin, said another officer.

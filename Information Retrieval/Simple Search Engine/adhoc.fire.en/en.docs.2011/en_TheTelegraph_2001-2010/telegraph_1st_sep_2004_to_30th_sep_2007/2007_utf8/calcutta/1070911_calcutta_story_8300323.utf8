 Door slams on outsiders

 - Engineering berths to be sole preserve of Bengal students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Students from other states, except Tripura, will be denied admission in state-run engineering institutes in Bengal from next year. There will be no such bar on private colleges.

 The move, sources said, will ensure that government subsidy on engineering seats in state-run colleges is not spent on outstation students.

 Candidates from anywhere in India can sit for the joint entrance examinations (JEE). But those from other states, except Tripura, will not be given a berth in any state-run college, higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri said on Monday.

 Why the preferential treatment for Tripura? Officials were tight-lipped but sources attributed it to old ties between the education departments of the two states.

 The bar on cross-country admissions does not cover Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, which are autonomous institutions. They are free to take their own decisions, clarified minister Ray Chaudhuri.

 The restriction will, however, extend to the Institute of Leather Technology, Institute of Ceramic Technology, institutes of textile technologies in Serampore and Behrampore, Jalpaiguri Engineering College and Kalyani Government Engineering College.

 Explaining the rationale, an official said the annual fee in a state-run college is around Rs 10,000, against Rs 45,000 charged by private institutes. 

 Ever since the government decided to open the doors of state-run colleges to outstation students in 2005, candidates from other states have been occupying 25-40 per cent of the seats. The bar will ensure that government subsidy, which keeps the fee in state-run colleges in check, only benefits students from Bengal and Tripura.

 In a move to curb malpractice in the JEE, the government has decided not to set up any test centres beyond Bengal from this year. An exception, again, has been made for Tripura.

 Till 2006, exam venues were set up in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Guwahati and other cities outside Bengal. The decision has been taken to check malpractice by candidates. The government has failed to arrange for proper invigilation at the outstation centres, claimed an official.

 The higher education minister also said the JEE board, which will meet on Tuesday, has been asked to consider whether the existing multiple-choice questions can be replaced partially with short-answer type questions.

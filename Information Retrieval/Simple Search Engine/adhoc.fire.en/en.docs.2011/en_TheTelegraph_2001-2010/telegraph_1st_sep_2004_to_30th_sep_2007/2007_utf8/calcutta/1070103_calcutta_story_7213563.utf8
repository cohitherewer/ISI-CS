 American desi: Brad Pitt

 All the good-looking men in Hollywood grow up to be great actors. Sean Penn did. Johnny Depp did. And now its Brad Pitt. Not that he was ever a pushover but his performance in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus Babel is being raved about everywhere and he has also garnered a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

 Brad is a partner at Plan B (production house) and was attached to the film before we signed with Paramount, says Inarritu. For the American couple (Pitt and Cate Blanchett) travelling through Morocco, who are in a sad, intense and personally emotional situation, Brad represented the type of American I needed for the story. However, it is not an obvious choice and its not a characteristic Pitt role that the public is familiar with.

 And it wasnt easy for Pitt. Many characters in Babel were cast straight from the Moroccan village where we were shooting, he recalls. They picked acting up really quickly. It took me down a notch seeing them play their roles so effectively.

 But it all turned out to be funny at the end. When I watched the movie, I had trouble distinguishing the seasoned actors from the first-timers. That gave me a bit of a laugh, Pitt says.

 In case you are missing his trademark one-liner, well, here it goes: Being part of an ensemble is always more fun, he says, you dont have to carry the film.

 Babels already released in Mumbai and should make its way to the Calcutta theatres by March.

 on the ball: Arshad Warsi with Andy Ansah as Boman Irani watches

 Arshad Warsi is a lazy man and he has no qualms about admitting it. So when Andy Ansah got him to sweat it out, our man Circuit wasnt a happy man. But the training sessions came with the contract for Vivek Agnihotris (Chocolate) forthcoming film Goal, also starring John Abraham and Bipasha Basu.

 Andy, of course, is widely acknowledged as the best in the business when it comes to bringing soccer to celluloid. The former English Premier League footballer and now a football choreographer, Andy has worked with the likes of Pele, Eric Cantona, Ronaldinho, David Beckham, Thierry Henry, Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. 

 Although he has been feeling rusty, Arshad confesses that he is in love with football, one of the reasons he agreed to do Goal. The other reason being getting to work with John Abraham again; he is an absolute delight, says Arshad.

 But there is a lot of difference between general football and film football, feels Andy. General football doesnt tell a story. And films are about emotions, about relationships, says the man who has choreographed the action in most Nike ads.

 And Andy loves the student in Arshad. He is good, he shoots.

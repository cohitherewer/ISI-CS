The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Thrown off moving bus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tapas Narayan Roy

 A college teacher was thrown off a moving bus by one of its conductors who was instructing the driver to rev up and overtake another bus on Bidhan Sarani on Wednesday morning. The teacher was on the footboard, waiting to get off.

 Tapas Narayan Roy, 48, head of the commerce department at Rammohan College, dashed against a stationary Matador and was seriously injured on his back and in the left hand.

 With blood oozing from the wounds, he went to Amherst Street police station and narrated the incident and even passed on the registration number of the bus to the officers.

 But the cops there directed him to Jorasanko police station, as the spot where he was thrown off was beyond their jurisdiction.

 But I was in severe pain and instead, went to Medical College and Hospital for treatment. From there, I went to my college on Amherst Street. My colleagues later contacted the police, recalled Roy.

 The conductor, Tarak Guha, was soon tracked down and arrested. We will take action against him, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Roy, a resident of Mandalpara Lane, in Sinthee, boarded the bus on route 78/1 at Sinthee More around 8.30am. I was on my way to college. There was no problem till Shyambazar. Soon after hitting Bidhan Sarani, the driver, goaded on by the conductor, started speeding recklessly, said Roy.

 The teacher and a few other passengers protested the rash driving. But the conductors and driver ignored us. As the bus approached Thanthania Kalibari, where I was to get off, I came up to the front gate.

 I asked the conductor to stop the bus at the temple, but he again ignored my words. Instead, he blocked the gate with one of his hands and hurled abuses at me.

 After the bus crossed the temple, I pulled the wire attached to a bell in the drivers cabin, signalling him to stop. The driver slowed down a bit. As soon as I stepped on the footboard, the conductor pushed me hard. I lost my balance and fell off the vehicle, Roy recounted.

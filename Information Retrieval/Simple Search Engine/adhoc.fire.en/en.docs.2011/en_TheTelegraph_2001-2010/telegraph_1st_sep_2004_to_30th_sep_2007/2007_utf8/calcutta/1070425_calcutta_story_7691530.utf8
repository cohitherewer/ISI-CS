 Cradle for able doctors 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Of the 2.5 million heart surgeries required in India every year, only 70,000 get done in the countrys heart hospitals. All the medical colleges together churn out a meagre 80 cardiologists annually, and an even more pathetic 40 cardiac surgeons.

 Numbers palpable enough to make your heart miss a beat. Add to that the distressing doctor-patient ratio of 5:1000 and the skewed distribution of medical personnel leaning towards urban centres, and we are staring at a catastrophic situation. 

 Udayer Pathe, an educational scholarship programme, aims to address this gap in manpower resources by tapping sapling talent in rural schools and nurturing them to become able doctors with mentoring and guidance.

 An initiative of Asia Heart Foundation (AHF) a public charitable trust chaired by cardiac surgeon Devi Shetty the scholarship programme designed to bring medical education within the reach of the bright indigent, was flagged off by state school education minister Partha Dey on Tuesday.

 This is a forward-looking project in which we are privileged to participate. The government realises we need many more doctors of real calibre and an initiative like Udayer Pathe will have a great impact on our social well-being, Dey declared.

 The programme will initially identify around 200 talented students promoted to Class VII in 24 government schools in small towns and villages of Bengal and will continue through Class XII. These students will be extended a scholarship of Rs 500 per month to meet study costs and provided medical treatment free.

 We feel its important to create a cachet of qualified medical graduates for the future, which would help India administer its healthcare system more effectively for the common man. This is critical because healthcare will soon be dissociated from affluence, like the mobile phone, observed Shetty.

 He felt the rural populace could throw up more cardiac and neuro-surgeons, areas of super-speciality often shunned by the urban students for the arduous hours involved. The programme, being kicked off in this academic year itself, will be grown to include 2,000 students every year, and will be replicated in other states.

 Calling it a visionary project, Nandita Chatterjee, principal secretary, department of school education, said: Scholastic achievement tests conducted by the NCERT have consistently found Bengal students top of the heap and an opportunity like this would inspire them further.

 Lamenting that there are no indices for measuring delivery of healthcare and that its often left in the hands of administrators, Kunal Sarkar, director, administrative services, AHF, pointed out there arent enough doctors to even man the coronary care units in Calcuttas private hospitals. The chasm puts the scholarship in perspective. In the next phase, focus will be on girls schools and nursing, he said.

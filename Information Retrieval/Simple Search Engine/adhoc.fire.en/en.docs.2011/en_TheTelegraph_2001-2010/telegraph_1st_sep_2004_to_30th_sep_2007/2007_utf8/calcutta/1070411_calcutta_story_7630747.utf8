 Infection spectre at clinics 

 - Sterilisation facility not up to mark, says German expert

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The operating theatres in most Calcutta hospitals lack proper sterilisation facility, according to a foreign expert.

 Ulrich Kaiser, German delegate in the standards committees of the European Standard Organisation and the International Standard Organisation, said in the city on Tuesday that hospitals in this part of the globe have not upgraded their sterilisation system in operating theatres. This has increased the risk of secondary infection of patients. 

 Over the past 10 years, surgical techniques have undergone a sea change. From conventional open surgeries, we have moved on to state-of-the-art minimal invasive surgeries, said Kaiser, in Calcutta to take part in a workshop.

 The equipment required in the new methods are more complex. More sophisticated sterilisation is required for the latest equipment, he added.

 While conventional surgical equipment like scalpels and scissors are solid and need to be washed, the equipment used in minimal invasive surgeries are hollow and need to be disinfected from inside. 

 These equipment require special reprocessing techniques that are missing in most hospitals here, said Kaiser. 

 According to him, gravity displacement sterilisers are generally used in Calcutta to de-activate germs on the outer surface of equipment. To remove germs inside hollow equipment, modern fractional vacuum sterilisers are required, Kaiser pointed out.

 The manual cleaning systems in hospitals need to be replaced by automated washers (disinfectors), according to the German expert. 

 Gas and steam sterilisation are used to disinfect minimal invasive equipment. Automated disinfection machine has been installed in our hospital for proper cleaning, said Tapan Kumar Das, senior executive in the sterilisation supply department of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital 

 An important advantage of minimal invasive surgery is the significantly lower chance of wound infection, compared to open surgery. However, laparoscopic equipment may cause infection because of improper sterilisation and cleaning of equipment, observed B. Ramana, laparoscopic surgeon at Wockhardt Hospital.

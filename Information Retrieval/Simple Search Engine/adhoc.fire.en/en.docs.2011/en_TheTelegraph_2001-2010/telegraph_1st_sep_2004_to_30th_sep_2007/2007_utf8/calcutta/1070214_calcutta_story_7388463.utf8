Teachers of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) went on mass casual leave on Tuesday to protest the delay by the Centre in upgrading the university to an Institute of National Importance (INI).

 We will undertake a prolonged agitation to push for the upgrade, declared Bengal Engineering and Science University Teachers Association president Sujay Mukherjea.

 The teachers will meet the vice-chancellor at 11 am on Wednesday to persuade him to seek a meeting with state higher education minister Sudarshan Roy Chowdhury over the issue.

 The association also wants the Union government to provide the 150-year-old institution a recurring grant to help meet the daily expenses and augment facilities on campus.

 We receive a Rs 12-crore annual grant from the state government for payment of salaries. Our monthly expenditure is about Rs 23 crore. Students fees, research grant and faculty consultation projects generate about Rs 8 crore. Occasional, UGC grants make another Rs 3-4 crore. We just about manage to break even at Rs 26 crore. How are we to sustain ourselves if we do not receive a recurring grant from the Centre? asked Prof N.R. Bandopadhyaya, head of material sciences department. 

 The association fears the upgrade programme might be shelved and the Centre might just sanction a block grant of Rs 500 crore, under the Eleventh Plan, in the coming budget.

 The mystery woman

 Treading in the footsteps of the classic ghost story, Shey relies on its eerie atmosphere, vivid locale and hints, glances and suggestions to build up events leading to a terrifying climax. Set in the desolate marshlands of the British east coast, it begins with the death of Alice Drablow, who lived all alone in a massive old mansion. Arthur Kipps, a junior solicitor in a legal firm, arrives from London to attend her funeral and sort her papers of inheritance. A city-bred young man, he is reluctant to stay in a remote, rural place, and is filled with a sense of dread upon reaching his new, unfamiliar surroundings. When he spots a mysterious, emaciated-looking young woman dressed in black at the funeral, he tries to find out who she is and her relationship with the deceased, but in vain. Puzzled and curious at the locals refusal to disclose anything about her, he waits until he meets her again. Finally, when the moment comes, she reveals to him her true identity and her terrible purpose. Story: Susan Hill. Play: Stephen Mallatratt. Direction: Saswati Biswas.

 Event: Shey, a play presented by Theatron When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

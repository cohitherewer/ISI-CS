 NGOs to fight sting squadron

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After running up a bill of Rs 100 crore over 20 years in trying to rid the city of mosquitoes, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to pass on the responsibility to NGOs.

 The Union ministry of health has offered financial help for the project, which will rope in NGOs to popularise insecticide-treated nets. Mosquitoes die on coming in contact with such nets.

 Additional secretary of central health ministry Deepak Gupta and director of the national vector-borne disease control programme P.L. Joshi held a meeting with joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam and chief municipal health officer (CMOH) Debdwaipayan Chattopadhyay in this regard at Swasthya Bhavan on Monday. 

 The civic body spends about Rs 5 crore a year to keep mosquito breeding in check. Since it is a labour-intensive exercise, participation of NGOs and private agencies can be helpful, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. 

 It has been principally agreed, pointed out the CMOH, that the CMC will supply the larvicide and other chemicals to the NGOs. The NGOs will also get funds from the civic body.

 The NGOs will get mosquito nets and chemicals for the insecticide treated net project. The Centre will provide Rs 10 for coating each mosquito net with chemicals. 

 We will involve private agencies in vector control without retrenching the civic staff responsible for the work, stated the municipal commissioner. 

 The civic body is committed to killing mosquitoes since they are the cause of malaria and dengue. We dont want to shirk our duty. Instead, we want to make the anti-mosquito drive more intensive with the help of NGOs and private professional agencies, said mayoral council member (health) Subodh De.

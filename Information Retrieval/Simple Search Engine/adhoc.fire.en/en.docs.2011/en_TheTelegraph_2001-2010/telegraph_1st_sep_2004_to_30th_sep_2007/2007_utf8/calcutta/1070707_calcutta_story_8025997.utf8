 Hilsa SOS to Buddha

 - Importers against ban

 A STAFF REPORTER

 DEAR DELICACY: Hilsa being sold in a city market. The price of the local variety is expected to shoot up, with the Bangladesh government banning the export of the Padma ilish. A Telegraph picture

 Hilsa importers have sent an SOS to the chief minister following a Bangladesh government ban on export of the fish to India. 

 We submitted a letter to the chief ministers office today, requesting him to intervene in the matter. We are in touch with the hilsa exporters of Bangladesh. They are trying to persuade their government to lift the ban, said Atul Chandra Das, the president of the Hilsa and Varieties Fish Importers Association, on Friday. 

 The ban has affected both hilsa-lovers and those associated with the trade.

 At this time of the year, hilsa is the biggest source of income for us. Wholesalers and retailers will suffer huge losses. The Indian government should pressure the Bangladeshi government to lift the ban, said Syed Anwar Maqsood, the secretary of the association.

 We had planned a lot of get-togethers thinking that we would be able to treat the guests to ilish preparations. The ban on the Padma ilish has spoiled our plans, said homemaker Sushmita Ghosh.

 At Lake Market, fish-seller Netai Mondal wondered how he would cater to Sunday customers of boro ilish. The only option is the local variety from Diamond Harbour and Kolaghat. Though they are not the first choice of my customers, their prices will shoot up because the Bangladeshi ilish is not available.

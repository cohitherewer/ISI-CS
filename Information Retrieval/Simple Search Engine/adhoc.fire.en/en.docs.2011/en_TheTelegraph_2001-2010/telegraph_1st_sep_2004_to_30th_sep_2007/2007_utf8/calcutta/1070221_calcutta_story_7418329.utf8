 Teacher attacker at large

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Eighteen-year-old Imtiaz Khan, who threw acid on the face of his former teacher after she refused to marry him and agreed to an arranged match, remained at large on Tuesday, more than 48 hours after the attack near their home on Dr HK Chatterjee Street, in Howrah. 

 We are sick with anxiety. I know Imtiaz since he was a child. He is capable of doing anything. We cant be at peace until he is caught, said the brother of the 27-year-old woman, Anjum (name changed). 

 There are seven to eight burns on her face, neck and forehead. It seems a moderately corrosive acid was used. Luckily, her eyes were saved. We will keep her under observation for a few more days, said Jyotirmoy Mukherjee, who is treating Anjum at a local hospital.

 Her brother, along with some friends, is keeping a vigil at the hospital. We cant risk leaving Anjum alone, with Imtiaz free, he said.

 He cant hide from us for much longer, said additional superintendent of police (town) Milan Das.

 Anjum used to teach at a local higher secondary school, where Imtiaz had studied before dropping out in Class V. The teenager used to visit Anjums house. None of us could guess that he harboured such feelings for Anjum, said her maternal aunt.

 The attack came soon after Anjum agreed to an arranged marriage in a months time.

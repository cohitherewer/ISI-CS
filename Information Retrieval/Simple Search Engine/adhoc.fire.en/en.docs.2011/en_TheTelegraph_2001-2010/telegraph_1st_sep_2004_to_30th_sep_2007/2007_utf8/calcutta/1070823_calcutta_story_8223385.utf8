 Universal language of dance

 Ancient Vedic texts blend harmoniously into the popular Biblical story of how the world was created in Katha Srishti, this evenings presentation by Nrtyamandala Dance Ensemble of Mumbai. Based on Bharata Natyam, it employs Indian classical style to interpret a Christian myth, truly underlining the thread of unity in religious, cultural and regional diversity. A unique experimental piece, the performance portrays Adam and Eve in Paradise, Satan tempting Eve to taste the forbidden fruit and culminating in the Fall of Man, with Adam and Eves banishment from the Garden of Eden. Verses from the Rig-Veda and Upanishads are used in the musical narrative as the Voice of God, carrying forward the dramatic plot. Fusing Indian and Western styles, the score interprets Christian philosophy through traditional Indian symbolism, representing lightning, sun, moon, birds and water through dancers formations. Concept and choreography: Prakriti Bhaskar.

 Event: Dance presentation by Nrtyamandala Dance Ensemble When: Today at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB 201 Salt Lake

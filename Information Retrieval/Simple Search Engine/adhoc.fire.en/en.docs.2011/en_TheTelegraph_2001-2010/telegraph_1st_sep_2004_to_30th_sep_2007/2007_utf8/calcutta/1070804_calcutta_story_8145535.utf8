 After JEE, marks glare on lawyers

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Police have identified 10 lawyers who have been practising in Calcutta High Court with fake Ll.B marksheets.

 We are framing charges against them and they will be arrested soon, said an officer of the detective department.

 The names of the 10 lawyers have also been sent to the West Bengal Bar Council, along with documents proving that they had applied for enrolment producing fake marksheets, the officer added.

 If the charges are proved, a council office-bearer said, the lawyers will lose their enrolment and with it, the right to practise in any court.

 The move against the tainted lawyers coincides with the probe into the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) scam that has led to the arrest of 16 persons, including two doctors.

 The 10 tainted lawyers have been identified during an investigation extending over two years into a racket that issued fake Ll.B marksheets.

 The probe, by the anti-fraud section of the detective department, is still on against 200 other lawyers who are practising in various courts in the city. We are gathering evidence before taking legal action against them, the officer added.

 Uttam Kumar Majumdar, the vice-chairman of West Bengal Bar Council, said they are yet to receive the names of the 10 lawyers. We will certainly cancel their enrolment if they are found to have submitted fake marksheets while applying for it and extend all help to the police.

 He added that the council now verifies the marksheets and certificates of each candidate seeking enrolment.

 The fake marksheet racket came to light following the arrest of two men in Jorasanko in 2004. A criminal case was lodged against them after several fake marksheets, bearing the seal of a few colleges and universities in Bihar and Jharkhand, were found in their possession.

 The detective department took up the investigation in 2005 and alerted the West Bengal Bar Council. The sleuths came to know that the two had been operating the racket from the city through agents in those colleges and universities.

 They told the police that they had handed over fake Ll.B marksheets to several individuals in the city.

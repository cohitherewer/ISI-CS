 HONOUR: Presidency College. A Telegraph picture

 Presidency College is set to add another feather to its cap. 

 The biotechnology department of the Union ministry of science and technology has chosen the college for setting up Indias first modern bio-science teaching centre. Presidency College is the only institution shortlisted after a screening.

 A four-member committee from the department, including three eminent scientists, visited the college last Friday for the inspection. The college is working overtime to ensure that the proposal takes concrete shape, said Mamata Ray, principal of Presidency College, which runs a bio-informatics centre now.

 The panel inspected our zoology, botany and physiology departments and also our chemistry section. They expressed satisfaction with the infrastructure, quality of faculty and other facilities, added Ray.

 The bio-science hub will be financed entirely by the Centre. It will also have facilities for advanced research.

 The Union government has plans to start bio-science teaching centres in a number of institutions across the country. The Presidency model will be adopted by the other institutions. 

 We are happy that Presidency College has been selected for setting up a modern bio-science teaching centre. It is an achievement for the college as well as the state. However, the proposal is in its initial stage, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, science dean of Calcutta University. He is also member of a committee set up by the state government to explore the possibilities of developing bio-science and biotechnology education in Bengal.

 Crash fuels Phuket fears

 - Calcutta tourists rejig plans to fly to Southeast Asia beach resort

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The plane crash at the Phuket airport, in Thailand, could not have come at a worse time for Calcutta tourists, and also travel agents and airlines flying to the southeast Asian country from the city.

 Just when the passenger traffic on the sector was picking up, riding high on the Puja fervour, news of the early Sunday mishap has several prospective fliers from the city rethinking their plan to visit Phuket.

 We have received a number of calls from tourists who are apprehensive about flying to Phuket. Some bookings are on hold. Such fears are common after any mishap at a tourist destination, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India. He is, however, hopeful that the impact will die down well before the Pujas.

 Travellers intending to visit Phuket fly to Bangkok, the Thai capital, from where most take low-cost carriers to the beach resort. The plane that crashed at Phuket belonged to one such carrier, One-Two-Go.

 Sanjay Lamba, a city-based businessman, had planned to be in Phuket later this week. I am on a business trip to Bangkok and from there, I was to fly to Phuket. But the crash has forced me to change my plans, said Lamba.

 Ditto with Aditya Sharma, an executive of a private bank in the city, who was scheduled to visit Phuket towards the end of the month. My parents are not allowing me to go there, after watching the news on TV, said Sharma.

 Being a cheap destination where a visa is issued on arrival, Bangkok attracts most Calcuttans among all tourist spots in the region. Every month, around 6,000 people from this part of the country go to Bangkok. During the four Puja days, 2,000-odd tourists fly to Bangkok from Calcutta. A large number of them make a touchdown at Phuket.

 With the Thai authorities deciding to relax immigration rules for tourists from October 1, the figure is likely to shoot up several notches.

 A Thai Airways official said its flights are going full. A Jet Airways spokesperson said: The rush will start from the end of this month and will continue till end-October.

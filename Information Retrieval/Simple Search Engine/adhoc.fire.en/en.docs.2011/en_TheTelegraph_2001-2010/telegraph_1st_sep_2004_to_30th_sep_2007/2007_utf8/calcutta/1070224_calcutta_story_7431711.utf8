 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is in a scurry to complete the restoration of Minerva theatre by Poila Baisakh. 

 The basic work has been completed. We are trying our best to unveil the new-look theatre on the first day of the Bengali calendar, said chief executive officer of CMDA P.R. Baviskar.

 Local CPM parliamentarian Sudhangshu Sil, who allotted money for the project from his local area development fund, also expressed hope that the project will be completed by Poila Baisakh, on April 15. 

 If everything goes smoothly, we should meet the deadline. Architecture firm Dulal Mukherjee and Associates have been engaged by the government for the work. The theatre will look quite unique after restoration, said the MP. 

 The 6/1 Beadon Street address carved a special place for itself on the Bengali theatre map, soon after its unveil in January 1893. Its founder-member, one of Bengal theatres leading men, Girish Chandra Ghosh went on to perform his last play here. 

 Since then, the theatre has changed several hands and also been gutted more than once. The golden era was probably the 1960s, when Utpal Dutt triggered a new wave of form and content in this hot seat of traditional theatre. From Angar to Titash Ekti Nadir Naam, Kallol to Ferari Fauj, Othello to A Midsummer Nights Dream Minerva rode high on a fine blend of eastern roots and western influences.

 Mukherjee said the restoration proved very difficult. The work has to be done carefully. The structure is not architecturally complex, but its historical value must be preserved, he stated. 

 A CMDA official said about Rs 5.5 crore will be spent on the project. Apart from the local area development fund, some money has come from the state government.

 The restored theatre will have two elevators and a car park for artistes. The number of seats in the auditorium has been brought down from 750 to 550, to increase free space. 

 There is provision for two fire tenders to drive up to the stage through the rear gate. In the adjoining building, there will be a coffee shop on the first floor and an archive and a library on the second floor for helping research scholars. We are stressing on a faultless acoustic system, said Sil.

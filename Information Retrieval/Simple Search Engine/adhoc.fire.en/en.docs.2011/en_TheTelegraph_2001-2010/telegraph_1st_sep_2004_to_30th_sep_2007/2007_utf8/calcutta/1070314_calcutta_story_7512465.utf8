 As mauling of the Maidan has become an issue following Sundays show of strength by the peasants wing of the CPM, the green lobby has decided to take its save-the-greens plea to the high court. 

 Though the rally organisers completed the clean up act on Tuesday morning, traces of the damage inflicted on the citys precious patch of green were staring in the face.

 These rallies cause irreparable damage to the greens. We are urging the Green bench to step in and provide suitable directives to save the Maidan, said S.M. Ghosh of Calcutta Green Network.

 Members of the fledgling body formed during the debate on the Book Fair venue met on Tuesday to chalk out their course of action.

 We are also writing to departments concerned, like environment and public health engineering, to highlight the environmental hazards of rallies, said Chiro Dutta, an environment activist.

 But Sailen Sarkar, state environment minister, said he was not aware of any violation of the environmental norms. If specific complaints are sent to us, we will definitely look into the matter, he assured.

 The green lobby has zeroed in on the major problem areas parking of vehicles on the Maidan, its use as urinal and toilet, use of plastic, noise norm violation and digging up of the field to create chulhas. 

 But the army custodian of the Maidan are maintaining silence before conducting an inspection, scheduled later this week. Everybody has seen what has happened to the Maidan But we can comment only after inspecting it, said an army spokesperson.

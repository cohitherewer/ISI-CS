 Low-cost home 

 glut 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government has announced the construction of 200,000 dwelling units for the citys urban poor, with a 24-month roll-out plan.

 State urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Wednesday that 60,000 low-cost houses have already been sanctioned and another 40,000 are in the pipeline. 

 He added that the stocks would be ramped up to 200,000 by 2009.

 Bhattacharya, at the inauguration of property exposition Home Front 2007 at Netaji Indoor Stadium, said: The fast pace of urbanisation throws up its own challenges and problems, which we cant ignore. Our effort to create housing for the economically-weaker sections (EWS) with the help of the private sector is one way of easing stress on the citys core infrastructure.

 Each of the dwelling units will be around 22 sq m in plinth and cost between Rs 80,000 and a lakh, depending on the location. 

 Pointing out the stifling pressure on urban services triggered by unplanned growth, Bhattacharya called upon the private sector to also actively participate in infrastructure creation to address the alarming urban sprawl in the peripheral areas.

 The Bengal chapter of Credai, the apex body of developers, has agreed to create this housing stock for the citys urban poor on a no-profit basis. The state hopes to get projects worth around Rs 3,000 crore sanctioned by the end of the year from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, a large portion of which will go towards the social housing scheme.

 Urban development secretary P.K. Pradhan expressed concern at the growing marginalisation of the urban poor and pledged that the state would act as a major facilitator to develop both civic and social infrastructure.

 The real estate boom is an indicator of Bengals economic growth. But we must adopt an inclusive approach, said Pradhan.

 The government has already received a couple of proposals from private companies one for a flyover in south Calcutta and another for a bus rapid transport system on the Kalyani Expressway.

 Credai Bengal president Pradeep Sureka said Bengal was the first to launch the public-private partnership initiative to alleviate the housing shortage through its joint and assisted-sector companies.

 Providing basic housing for the EWS at affordable prices would be a carry-forward of that initiative, he added.

 While Credai Bengal members concur covering even direct costs would be a struggle, they are speaking in one voice while committing to the cause of social housing.

 Its essentially replacement housing we are talking about, be it moving from kuchha homes or slums to these formatted units replacing a low-quality urban environment with a higher-quality one, observed Sumit Dabriwala, Credai state body vice-president.

 While this inclusive model of social housing is expected to impact at least six per cent of the Calcutta metropolitan area population in its first flush, the city developers forum is keen to cascade the model and create a larger stock of low-cost housing.

 Around 40 developers are showcasing more than 200 projects at the five-day expo organised by G.S. Marketing.

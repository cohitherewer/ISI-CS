The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Estate on occupied plots

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government will team up with builders to free about 400 cottahs of prime land in the heart of the city. The plots have been encroached on. The companies will build houses for the encroachers as well.

 The urban development department will invite tenders from realtors for building flats on a four-acre Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) plot in Bagmari that houses the dilapidated quarters of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority employees. Tenders will be floated for commercial exploitation of other encroached plots in Maniktala and Beleghata.

 This will be on a joint venture model. Well pay 50 per cent of the construction cost of the encroachers flats about Rs 1.2 lakh each. The beneficiaries will pay the rest. The promoters will be given extra land for building housing estates and malls. They will pay the government for use of the plots, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 On being asked why the government was building flats for encroachers, the minister replied: We cannot evict anybody without providing alternative housing. This includes even encroachers.

 About 930 flats, comprising LIG, MIG and HIG units, will be built on the Maniktala and Bagmari plots owned by the CIT. Tenders will also be invited for building flats for Gobindapur rail colony evictees.

 Big wars for small screen players

 - Slew of incentives to shore up viewer base

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

With the World Cup cricket barely two weeks away, the small screen is where all the action is taking place and the players in the television industry are rolling out attractive offers to push up their customer count. 

 If the direct-to-home (DTH) service providers are focusing on the city skyline, the cablewallahs and multi-system operators (MSOs) are targeting the conditional access system (CAS) Phase I area to sell set-top boxes (STBs). As the men in blue prepare for the Caribbean safari, the television manufacturers are also raising their sales pitch. 

 The companies are ready with their special-discount offers and we expect them to be announced after Holi As always, the sales of television sets are bound to rise before the World Cup cricket, said Mahindra Baid of Great Eastern Trading Company, gearing up to stock television sets before the demand picks up. 

 But the service providers feeling the heat of competition due to multiple options in the marketplace have already announced the goodies to ride on the cricket craze and notch up market share. 

 If DTH player Tata Sky is offering waiver of subscriptions for three months and an opportunity to watch the final match with actor Hrithik Roshan, competitor Dish TV has a promotional pack of six months free subscriptions for those availing the offer between February 19 and March 31.

 We are highlighting how the subscriber will be able to see the match from two exclusive camera angles of their choice (square leg and the stump-cam shots) apart from the live feed. He can also access match highlights and statistics at will, said Anjali Nanda, marketing head of Dish TV.

 To ensure that language doesnt come in the way of cricket viewing, arrangements are being made for commentaries in regional languages, like Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati and Malayalam, apart from the regular Hindi and English feed by Set Max.

 Tata Sky is promoting its interactive facilities, along with the celebrity and cost carrots. We are extending the free pricing policy to second, third and fourth television sets in a household and hope to reach one-million subscriber base by the end of this year, said Vikram Mehra, head, consumer marketing, Tata Sky. 

 As Set Max, where the World Cup feed will be available besides Doordarshan, is a pay channel, cable operators and multi-system operators (MSOs) are aggressively pushing STBs along with discount offers. 

 This is a great opportunity for us to sell the boxes to consumers, said Suresh Sethia of SitiCable.

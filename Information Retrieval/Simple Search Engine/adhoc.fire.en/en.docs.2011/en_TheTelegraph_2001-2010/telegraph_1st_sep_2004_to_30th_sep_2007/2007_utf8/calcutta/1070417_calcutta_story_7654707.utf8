 Bally battles enteric wave

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nearly 200 residents of Votebagan, Bally, have been admitted to hospital over the past two days, following contamination of drinking water. 

 The patients, including women and children, have been vomiting and suffering from stomach ache. For the want of beds, many are lying on the hospital floor.

 Bally Municipality has admitted that water contamination is behind the outbreak of enteric disease. It has sent a medical team to the area. The district administration has sent three teams with ORS, halogen tablets and bleaching powder.

 The disease was first reported in slums. It soon spread to other areas. More than 100 patients were admitted to Satyabala Infectious Diseases Hospital and about 75 to Tulsiram Laxmidebi Jaiswal Hospital. 

 Bally Municipality chairman Krishna Chandra Hazra said: The water got contaminated due to leaks in the pipeline. We have identified a leak and are plugging it. The medical team is asking residents not to drink contaminated water. We have sent 13 water tankers to Votebagan. The main overhead tank has also been cleaned. 

 Howrahs chief medical officer of health Sankar Saha blamed the municipality for failure to supply pure drinking water to Votebagan.

 We have sent 40,000 halogen tablets, 5,000 ORS packets and bleaching powder to the area, said Saha. He claimed the situation was under control.

 District magistrate Khalil Ahmed visited the patients on Monday and promised support.

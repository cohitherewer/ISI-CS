 Metro Railway introduced smart cards to make regular travel more convenient, but for some passengers, it has become a source of harassment. Thanks to shortage of gates with card readers.

 Since several station exits lack gates with smart card readers, passengers, many of them old and physically challenged, are forced to descend to the platform and then climb up to the other exits. 

 The smart cards, 60,000 of which are in circulation, work on the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. They have to be held within eight centimetres of a sensor, for the gate to which it is fitted to open.

 I climbed up a flight of stairs at Netaji Bhavan station, only to find that the exit had no gates with smart card readers. So, I descended to the platform, walked to its other end, climbed up another flight of stairs to exit the premises, said a Dum Dum resident, suffering from rheumatism.

 Anirban Chatterjee, who works in a private firm at Chandni Chowk, faces a similar problem every day: I cannot reach the platform through the west gate of the Belghachhia station using my smart card. So, I have to go down the east gate and walk half the length of the station to board the rear compartments of the train.

 It is not just the passengers who are facing problems due to the shortage of gates with smart cards. Commuters abuse us when we request them to use the other exit. If we let them out, they will lose Rs 7 for each ride. If the smart card has been swiped in, it must be swiped out, said a Metro Railway official at Netaji Bhavan station.

 We have complained several times to the authorities about the problem, but it has not been redressed, he added.

 The introduction of the smart card is a pilot project. We plan to adopt an RFID-based system and do away with paper tickets. We are toying with the idea of introducing RFID tokens for single rides. Once we decide on that, we will instal more gates with sensors, said Metro spokesperson S.C. Banerjee.

 For her next feature film, Aparna Sen is getting a Japanese girl to play Rahul Boses love interest. The Japanese Wife or Japani Bouma in Bengali will be an English film with some Bengali dialogues.

 It is based on a story by author Kunal Basu. The Bengali dialogues will be subtitled in English and the English portions will be subtitled for the Bengali audience in the interiors I think now is the time for multi-lingual films, Sen said on Wednesday.

 Starring Rahul Bose, Raima Sen and an actress to play the Japanese girl who is yet to be finalised, the film will be shot in Japan during the Cherry Blossom festival, in Calcutta, and in the Sunderbans.

 Rahul, for whom this will be the third film with Sen, plays an arithmetic teacher in the Sunderbans who doesnt know English. Its a beautiful and incredible love story. There are two women in his life. With one he has marriage but no domesticity, with the other he has domesticity but no marriage, said Sen.

 The love between the teacher and the Japanese girl grows through letters. And both have to consult dictionaries. Rahul looks up a Bengali-to-English dictionary, and the Japanese girl consults a Japanese-to-English one, added the film-maker, who starts shooting in March-end and hopes to wrap up by June.

 Raima plays a village girl in the film. I will be attending workshops with Rahul and Aparna Sen in Mumbai, she said from Mumbai, very excited about her debut in a Sen film.

 The Japanese Wife comes after two of Sens projects were shelved Gulel and Goynar Baksho. This film will be produced by RPG Enterprises, which is making a fresh start in Tollywood after two flop shows Mantra, a horror film directed by Rabiranjan Maitra, and Swapno, a Prosenjit-starrer directed by Haranath Chakraborty.

 Consolidating its film production business across the country, RPG Enterprises has formed a fresh team Aparna Sen as head of the Bengali film and TV business, B.R. Sharan as head of the Hindi film business and B.R. Vijaylakshmi to steer the Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam film units.

 Earlier, we used to evaluate scripts and finance projects, but now we have people at the senior-most level who can drive the business, said Subroto Chattopadhyay, president and CEO, entertainment sector, RPG Enterprises.

 We are looking at the Bengali-speaking population in and outside Bengal. We are looking at three-four films a year and this part of the country will be very important, he added.

 The Hindi movie biggie will be Rituparno Ghoshs Draupadi. This year we are also releasing Karma, Confessions and Holi starring Naomi Campbell and Sushmita Sen. We have clear marketing plans in place for our projects, said Sharan.

 The creative team for Bengali films will screen and choose scripts submitted by upcoming film-makers. There would be a good mix of different kinds of films. There will be artistic films, some middle-path films and some made by people like me, Rituparno and others, said Sen, whose last film 15, Park Avenue released last January.

 We want to be producers, not financiers, and we want to bring quality control to the films we make. I want to help young directors and take away the problems that I had faced as a young director. I will help them with the script, which is my biggest area of expertise, and also with the sets, cast and crew. My aim would be to marry quality with economic viability, stressed Sen. 

 At a later stage, RPG Enterprises will provide content for Bengali TV channels.

 Bus-owners point to Citu muscle 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Members of the Bengal Bus Syndicate met Ranjit Maity, the special secretary of the transport department, on Thursday and alleged that ill-trained drivers who have the backing of the ruling partys trade union wing Citu are often allowed to drive buses, resulting in mishaps on the city roads.

 We have no right to select the drivers and conductors. Yet, whenever there is an accident or violation of traffic norms, the onus falls on us, stated Rabindra Nath Saha, the vice-president of the bus-owners union. 

 Bus drivers and conductors should wear uniforms and carry identity cards so that accountability can be fixed. We are even prepared to bear the cost of these measures, the union said in a letter addressed to the Maity. 

 We request you to appoint only trained drivers and conductors, observed the letter. 

 It also asked the transport secretary to consider changing the commission system of payment for the conductors and drivers to avert overtaking and mishaps.

 The syndicate blamed the condition of the citys roads for the regular accidents.

 The condition of Prasad Naskar, who was beaten up by his headmaster on Saturday, has deteriorated and he is fighting for life at MR Bangur Hospital.

 The Class VIII student of Dakshin Durgapur Sreekrishna Chandra High School, in Baruipur, is in a semi-conscious state and doctors said the next 48 hours are crucial for him.

 We have carried out a CT scan and other tests and are waiting for the results, said a hospital official.

 Headmaster Prabhakar Das, who admitted to having hit the boy for not turning up in school uniform, is absconding.

 Subhendu Naskar, a member of the managing committee of the hostel where the boy stays, alleged that school secretary Sudhendu Biswas had forced National Medical College and Hospital to release Prasad on Sunday night.

 Biswas claimed Prasad was fine, though he was not looking so. Around 2am, he started vomiting and having seizures. We rushed him to MR Bangur Hospital. He has since been administered five bottles of saline, but is still writhing in pain, said Naskar.

 The boy seemed fine when I brought him back. I hope he recovers soon, the school secretary said.

 I want my son back, sobbed mother Anita, barely able to speak. Father Manoranjan said: I am a daily wager with five children to feed. Prasad is good in studies and we thought he would take responsibility of the family one day. God knows what will happen to him.

 Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), said: A probe has been ordered on the basis of a complaint lodged by the hostel authorities. A hunt is on for the headmaster.

 The school remained closed on Monday as students and teachers boycotted classes to protest the assault.

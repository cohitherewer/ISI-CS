 Rash driver loses life

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rash driving and violation of road rules claimed the life of a youth and left two of his friends injured on Sunday morning.

 Ganesh Munda, in his mid-20s, was riding down Basanti Road, in the Tiljala police station area, on a motorcycle. His friends were riding pillion.

 Witnesses said Ganesh was driving the motorcycle at breakneck speed. As soon as he took a small turn, he was confronted with a Matador. Unable to slow down the vehicle, he rammed into the Matador, said an officer of Tiljala police station.

 Police said the youths had violated all basic road rules. They were driving recklessly and none had a helmet on. Besides, traffic rules do not allow more than two persons on a motorcycle, the officer added.

 The driver of the Matador, however, has been arrested and the vehicle impounded.

 Boy dies in wall collapse

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A four-year-old boy was killed when a portion of a wall collapsed on him ,after being hit by a Matador, inside a colony on Coal Dock Road on Tuesday morning.

 The boy was rushed to SSKM Hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. The driver escaped but the vehicle was impounded and brought to South Port police station.

 According to colony residents, Vasisht Shaw was sitting outside his house on Coal Dock Road, off the Indian Navy quarters, along Birsa Munda Sarani. 

 The Matador was on its way out of the colony when the driver took a sharp turn and hit the wall, next to which Vasisht was sitting.

 A portion of the wall collapsed and Vasisht was buried under the debris.

 The bricks fell on his head and he was badly injured. Bystanders tried to extricate the boy out of the heap but it was too late, said an officer of the South West Traffic Guard.

 Residents said that for the past few days, development work was on in the locality.

 On Tuesday morning, vans were deployed to ferry garbage that was collected inside the locality. 

 After Vasishts death, residents went berserk and demanded that traffic constables be deployed in the colony to check rash and negligent driving.

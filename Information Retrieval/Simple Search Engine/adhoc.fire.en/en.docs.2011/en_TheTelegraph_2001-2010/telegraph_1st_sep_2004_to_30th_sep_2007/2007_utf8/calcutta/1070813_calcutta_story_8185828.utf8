 Tagores fantasy relived

 Though Tagore wrote He (Shey) to satisfy his nine-year-old grand-daughters incessant demands for stories, the book is not just for children but for the eternal child in adults as well. Even as Tagore began to compose his grand fantasy, he planned a story that would continue without end. To keep his tales spinning endlessly, he employed the help of Shey (He), a man constituted entirely of words and rather talented at concocting tall tales. In the delightful world of Sheys extraordinary adventures, readers encounter a bizarre cast of characters like ganja-addict Patu, a misdirected jackal, snuff-sniffing scientists and new-age poets; grotesque creatures like the Gandishandung and Bell-Ears; comic caricatures of contemporary characters and events, as well as mythological heroes and deities all brought to life through a sparkling play of words and vivid illustrations in Tagores unique style (cover illustration by Tagore appears right). In this first-ever complete English translation of Shey, including Tagores nonsense verse in his amusing, entertaining and enchanting style, translator Aparna Chaudhuri has brilliantly captured the spirit and flavour of the original. To be launched this evening by Penguin Books India and Oxford Bookstore Calcutta.

 lEvent: Launch of the English translation of Rabindranath Tagores book for children, He (Shey) lWhen: Today at 6.30 pm lWhere: Oxford Bookstore, 17 Park Street

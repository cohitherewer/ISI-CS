 Jonathan Routh and John Glashan had written an unusual set of small guidebooks: The Good Loo Guide (subtitled Where to go in London), The Guide Porcelaine to the Loos of Paris and The Better John Guide (about New York) in the Sixties.

 The Good Loo Guide began with a disclaimer that could have made any Good Food Guide proud: This is an impartial guide. Our visits to loos have been anonymous. We have not declared ourselves even after making use of the establishments facilities. Nor have we at any time accepted hospitality, but paid cash for all chargeable facilities we have used. The guides came with convenient illustrations. 

 Calcutta is yet to get a guide in print, but one concerned Calcuttan, university teacher and columnist Abhijit Gupta, has put up a blog called the Good Loo Guide, for this city and others. The blog has a five-point agenda: 

 1. A list of loos for those inconvenient moments in time and space, in all the major world cities. If you have any loos to recommend, please post the location in the Comments section, giving full details about opening hours, tariffs, softness of loo paper and so on. 2. A rating of all major loos, on a scale of one to five. 3. The loo in history. 4. Loo Read. 5. Loos of the future: a loo(k) at what the future holds in store. Not all questions are answered.

 The post on Park Circus Crossing goes: This is a tough one, by all accounts. Where does one go if caught short at the Park Circus crossing? National Medical College? Lady Brabourne (shudder)? Or the wide open greensward on Park Circus maidan, the only place in Calcutta where you can crap along with the hippo and the elephant? Or does one sneak into the tram depot? 

 There are extensive reports on loos at the 8B bus terminus, Jadavpur University and Prince Anwar Shah Road. Though one post complains that there is not much feedback from women.

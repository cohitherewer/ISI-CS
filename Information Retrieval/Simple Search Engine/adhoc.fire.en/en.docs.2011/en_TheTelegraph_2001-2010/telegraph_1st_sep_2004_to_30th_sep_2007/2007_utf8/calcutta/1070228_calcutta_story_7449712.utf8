 Everything to do with palms will now be within reach. And almost everything to do with greenery, too. 

 Calcutta got its first Green Mall on Tuesday, when Sunderbans development minister Kanti Ganguly inaugurated a one-stop nursery-cum-shop in South 24-Parganas. 

 Spread over nine acres about 10 km from Thakurpukur, the project is rearing 250 to 300 types of palms and 20 varieties of cycads. A 3,000-sq-ft conclave also stores nursery requisites like pipes, agro-shade nets, sprinklers and pots.

 This project will be the lighthouse in our nursery industry, said Ganguly, lauding the efforts of D.C. Rawat, chairman of Sahayog Hortica. 

 The area, as local MLA Rathin Sarkar pointed out, is the nursery belt of West Bengal. State environment and horticulture minister Mohanta Chatterjee was no less effusive.

 Rawat said he wanted to reach out to people living in the concrete jungle, wanting a bit of green in their lives but not knowing where to go for help. We will also be helping out small nursery-owners by providing them seeds, compost and saplings, he added.

 The green company has rubbed off on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Mayor-in-council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan announced a project to use palm trees as road dividers, in collaboration with Sahayog. We have identified three stretches AJC Bose Road (from the Taj Bengal crossing to DL Khan Road crossing), Raja SC Mullick Road (Jadavpur station to 8B bus stop) and Anwar Shah Road (Lords Bakery crossing to Jadavpur police station). 

 A tree census, by Calcutta Environment Improvement Trust and funded by the DFID, is set to start soon. We will also look into what kind of trees needs to be planted on which road, Khan said.

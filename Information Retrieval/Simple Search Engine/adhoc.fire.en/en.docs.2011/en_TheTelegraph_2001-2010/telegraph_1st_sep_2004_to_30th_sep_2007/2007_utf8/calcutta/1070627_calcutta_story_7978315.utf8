 Channels for a price

 - TRAI SURVEY ON RATE REGULATION

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A questionnaire issued by the telecom regulatory authority of India (Trai) has drawn several suggestions aimed at capping channel rates in non-CAS areas.

 Industry observers and consumer associations have pointed out in their replies that private players are pressing for an unjustified hike in channel rates despite a significant rise in advertisement revenue and the fact that digital compression of satellite signals has brought down the telecast cost.

 The price regulation can be carried out in two ways based on location and the type of channel being telecast, stated ORTEL, an industry observer.

 The monthly bill can vary from, say, Rs 350 to Rs 200 or even less per month, depending on the economic condition of an area. Or entertainment channels can be priced at Rs 5 each and sports at Rs 10 each, while news channels can be free, ORTELs report suggested.

 Another industry observer has argued against the proposal not to enforce a cap in non-CAS areas. That will lead to exploitation of consumers and defeat the very purpose of appointing a regulator for the broadcasting industry, the observer pointed out.

 A ceiling for channel rates and subscription fees has become necessary to promote digitisation. If the regulatory body fails to implement a price cap, the process of digitisation it has started will either stop or will give way to other digital services, like DTH and IPTV, that are not regulated, said VOICE, a consumer association.

 VOICE has challenged the idea of the rates being determined by market forces, based on the popularity of channels. Pay channels in many European countries are not allowed to air advertisements. Similar rules should be introduced in our country, too, it stated.

 A Trai official said an action plan will be drawn up after reviewing all the suggestions.

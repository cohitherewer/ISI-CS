The artefacts on display highlight the many levels of reality that exist for all of us, but are understood and projected by artists alone. From breathtaking renderings of landscapes to human forms, the exhibition has it all. There are works in acrylic, oil, mixed media and watercolours, and materials like fibre glass and metal sculptures in bronze. Shipra Bhattacharyas oil painting titled She (picture right) is one such masterpiece on show.

 Three minors robbed the fun from a couples day out in an amusement park. 

 Subarna Das and her husband Amit came all the way from Uttarpara, in Hooghly, to Salt Lake to spend Sunday afternoon at Nicco Park. 

 But the fun park turned frightening when the couple entered Scareee one of the most sought-after rides in the amusement park after a brief walk on the lush lawns. 

 As the couple was trying to adjust to the dimly lit interiors of the chamber dotted with models of ghosts and supernatural characters Subarna realised that someone was tugging at her gold necklace. 

 She raised an alarm. Amit, who was standing next to her, reacted instantly and caught hold of the boy standing behind his wife, said North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar. 

 Noticing commotion inside the chamber, the security personnel of the park rushed in and switched on the lights. Amit had managed to hold on to the boy, later identified as 12-year-old Mohammad Babar. 

 A few months ago, he was caught in the park while attempting a snatch. So the security guards could easily identify him. He broke down in front in the face of interrogation and pointed out two other boys, who were with him, said a spokesperson of Nicco Park. 

 The boys, who live in Belgachhia, admitted to the security staff that they spent Rs 90 each to enter the amusement park with the intention of snatching. 

 The park officials handed over Babar and the two other minor boys Mohammad Saddam, 16, and Mohammad Farheen, 15 to Bidhannagar (South) police station. 

 We produced them in the juvenile court, from where they were sent to a correctional home, said a police officer. 

 The Nicco Park authorities are not perturbed by the incident and have ruled out special measures to counter such attempts in future. We maintain tight surveillance on our compound. This is an isolated case, said a spokesperson.

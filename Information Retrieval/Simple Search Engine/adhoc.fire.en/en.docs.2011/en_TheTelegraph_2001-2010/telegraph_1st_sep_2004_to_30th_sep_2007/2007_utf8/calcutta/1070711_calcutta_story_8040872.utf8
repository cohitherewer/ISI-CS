 Gone with the green: A view of a city cemetery. Picture by Biswarup Dutta 

 Apropos the letters on harassment of a schoolgirl

 in a private bus (June 13), copassengers not protesting against misconduct

 by drivers and conductors is common. Autorickshaw drivers emboldened by political

 backing of unions are worse in this respect and often harass passengers.

 Nobody protests, only to avoid complications. 

 Twenty years ago, I had seen a gentleman aged about 60 protesting against harassment of a schoolgirl by two boys in a private bus. The other passengers, including me, were silent. The boys stopped the bus on Beleghata Road and attempted to drag the gentleman off the bus to teach him a lesson. When locals intervened, the boys escaped. I still feel ashamed when I think of the incident. 

 S.N. Chatterjee, the first Indian police commissioner of the city, had ordered suspension of licences for road offences in 1948. Seventeen licences were suspended in a month and rule violations dropped. Now, action is frowned on and indifference appreciated.

 Apropos the report Gandhi prod paves way for grave upkeep, June 12, in others parts of the country and in many other countries, cemeteries are lovingly maintained and look like parks. The two cemeteries the report dwelt on, Lower Circular Road and Scottish Church, are in congested parts of the city and are surrounded by shanties. The cemeteries, shaded by trees and with wide open spaces, can be day-time oases for the neighbourhoods. 

 The last thing that the cemeteries need is high boundary walls. Nothing is more welcome to those who misuse the grounds at night. They will find a way in and no one can see their drinking and debauchery because of the walls. Furthermore, the walls would all too soon be painted with slogans and plastered with posters. Lets have low walls so we can refresh our city-sore eyes with the greenery and adequate lighting at night.

 Apropos the report Cemeteries are now crime dens,

 June 13, it is most unfortunate that the city cemeteries have turned to happy

 hunting ground for criminals. The picture published with the report clearly

 shows that the cemeteries need immediate attention and care. It is good that

 the governor has taken an initiative.

 Gopalkrishna Gandhis attempt to ensure upkeep

 of the cemeteries is meaningful. The lackadaisical attitude of the authorities

 must be condemned.

 It is alarming that 14 surgeries had to be carried out at Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital under emergency lights (Babudom in dark at noon, June 16). The lives of patients undergoing surgery are always at risk. Also, if there is shortage of power, preference should be given to hospitals over Writers Buildings.

 Apropos the report Citizens powerless in their misery, June 7, it has become necessary to highlight CESCs poor emergency service. Power supply to a phase in our housing estate went off at dawn recently. Since 8am, I called up the CESC call centre six times (docket nos. 12972, 13179, 13379, 13393 ), but no one turned up. Around 10.30pm, we contacted the district engineer of CESC (south) through the power ministers brother who resides in our complex. Power was restored within half an hour. We learnt from the Jadavpur CESC office that the call centre had alerted them only at 6.37pm.

 Apropos the report Buddha car halts in its flooded tracks June 14, thousands of us suffer the same way every day on the Dum Dum station subway. It resembles a water park. And theres no way you can hurry through the stretch with scores walking in two lines on a 2.5 feet wide fenced-off path.

 Apropos the report Bravo, Braveheart, June 12, what teenager Debasish Saha did in real life should not be compared with what Shah Rukh Khan fakes on the screen. The comparison is an insult to what he has done.

 In Freedom fighter forgotten (June 15), Jatindranath Dass nephew Milan Das says All that our uncle has got is a Metro Railway station named after him. But the department of posts had issued a 30-paisa stamp on his 50th death anniversary on 13.9.1979.

 Apropos the report Grooming for globetrotters, July 3, SinGem was formed in 1997 by our chairman Puneet Srimal. Richa Daga joined the board of directors in 2003. She is currently managing two franchisees of Sin Gem at Salt Lake and Howrah.

 All work and no play. This was the mantra with which the students of the BBA Department of St. Xaviers College had gone to work for the inter-college extravaganza, Xaviers Management Convention. Organised in association with The Telegraph, the product of two months hard work bore fruit on March 10 and 11. 

 Day 1 of the two-day convention saw a panel discussion on the topic Resurgent Bengal: Challenges and Opportunities. Principal of St Xaviers College, Father P.C. Mathew felt that Bengal had been the destination for higher education and industry, but that a vacuum had been created that was yet to be filled.

 Roopen Roy of Price Water Cooper stressed that the problem of industrialisation in Bengal could be solved only by a partnership between the private sector and the government. Noomi Mehta, managing director, Selvel, touched a positive note when he informed that per capita income in Bengal had increased to almost 7.6%, the highest compared to other states. Abhirup Sirkar, professor of Indian Statistical Institute, remarked that although Bengal was well supplied with labour and capital, acquiring land was a serious problem towards industrialisation, as the labour-land ratio in Bengal was skewed. Rahul Saraf, MD of Forum Projects, said: We are going through a period of gestation. Infrastructure business is booming in Calcutta now, leading to the formation of retail chains across the city that create more jobs.

 Students from eight colleges across the country, including St. Xaviers College, Ranchi and St. Josephs College, Darjeeling, participated in a host of events like Ham, Ad lib, XMC Mf, hot seat, tranXact and Xsolve. City colleges like Bhawanipur Gujarati Educational Society College, Scottish Church College and J.D Birla Institute of Management Studies were also present. J.D Birla Institute led the winners line-up, followed by the BBA and commerce department of the host college who took the second and third positions respectively.

 Markets bleed civic coffers

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 A survey by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has tagged the civic markets white elephants that collectively cost the civic exchequer Rs 15 crore a year.

 The study the report is yet to be published coincides with the debate on whether private retail players should be allowed to take over the loss-making markets.

 Of the 20 markets run by by the CMC, the one at Jadavpur bleeds the civic coffers the most the annual loss has shot up from Rs 31 lakh in 2005-2006 to Rs 35 lakh in 2006-07.

 If the salaries of the employees deployed at the markets are not taken into account, the civic markets together earned a profit of Rs 6.3 crore in 2006-07. But if the salary component is added to the expenditure, the markets incurred a loss of Rs 15 crore, pointed out joint municipal commissioner (markets) Sahidul Islam.

 The losses are as high as Rs 21 lakh and Rs 17 lakh in some other civic markets.

 Though civic officials are mum on why the survey was commissioned, Opposition leaders have alleged that the Left Front board will use the report to pursue its aggressive privatisation policy.

 The basic objective of the survey is to hand over the prime plots on which the civic markets stand to private parties, who will mint money by constructing highrises, said the leader of the Opposition in the civic house, Javed Ahmed Khan (Trinamul Congress).

 A similar allegation was made by Congress leader Pradip Ghosh.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya asserted that the upkeep of markets is not the civic bodys responsibility. We want to get rid of white elephants like Citizens Park and the civic markets.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said redevelopment of the civic markets is badly needed to ensure that citizens get a sanitised shopping environment and also to protect them from profiteering.

 There are 24 civic markets, of which the Park Circus market is scheduled to be handed over to a private party. Redevelopment work is on at College Street, Lake and Lansdowne markets.

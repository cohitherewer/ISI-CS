 Extraordinary acoustic experience

 Formed in 2006, Pink Noise features Amyt Datta on guitar, Jayashree Singh on vocals, Gyan Singh on bass and Jivraj Singh on drums and percussion. The music Pink Noise plays is mostly about getting away from tired old formulas. The originals are harmonically and rhythmically challenging, taking as they do, elements from jazz, both mainstream and modern, rock and the blues. The tunes are not formatted like pop songs, but evolve as they are played and incorporate constant improvisation which adds to the energy and edginess of the music. This evening, Pink Noise presents a programme of Jazz-based experimental and original music, that promises to provide the citys music-loving audience an enthralling, exciting experience.

 lEvent: Jazz-based experimental and original music concert lWhen: Today at 7 pm lWhere: Starmark, 3 Lord Sinha Road

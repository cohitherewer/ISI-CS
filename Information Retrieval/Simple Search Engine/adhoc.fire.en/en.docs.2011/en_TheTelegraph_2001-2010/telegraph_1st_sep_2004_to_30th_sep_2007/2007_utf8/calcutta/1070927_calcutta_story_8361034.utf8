 Dig into Bavarian delicacies like Wrstchen (sausages), Ksesptzle (cheese noodles) and Sauerkraut (pickled cabbage) and wash them down with authentic German draught beer while swaying to the strains of a Bavarian Brass Band and last, but not the least, learn German in 15 minutes flat!

 Calcutta is ready to welcome a slice of Oktoberfest, complete with a Munich-style munch menu and music, dance steps and dialect, at a city star hotel off the EM Bypass a heady appetiser ahead of our own festive high.

 Oktoberfest is a traditional German festival held every year in Munich, capital of the state of Bavaria, in southern Germany, during late September and early October. It is the worlds largest folk carnival, with around six million revellers guzzling a special beer brewed for the occasion, served in a one-litre tankard called Mass.

 We are flying in two German chefs specially for this German week (September 29 to October 5) to rustle up regional German dishes like the Wrstchen and Hendl (chicken). Besides, Bitburger, Germanys number one draught beer brewers, will keep the beer flowing, the German consul in Calcutta, Juergen Fischer, tells Metro.

 Calcuttas carnival kicks off on Thursday at the MMB. We want to bring to our language students the spirit of Oktoberfest through miniature crash courses in the Bavarian dialect, Bavarian folk music with the tuba and the yodoe, dance steps, German refreshments and an exciting raffle, says MMB director Reimar Volker.

 Volker feels its absolutely crucial to immerse the students in the culture and spirit of the land, and not just teach them the tongue.

 Its more of a pedagogical initiative, where they can learn about life in Germany at a special workshop, added Volker. 

 The institute plans to carry the carnival into the Christmas season, with German cookie-baking courses.

 The German consulate office is flying in the Bayerische Blaskapelle, a Bavarian Brass Band.

 The chefs will also do a selection of freshly baked German bread and conduct cookery classes.

 In Munich, the festival is held in an area called the Theresienwiese. Beer plays a central role, and every festival begins with a keg of beer tapped by the mayor of Munich, who declares Ozapft is! (Which means: Its tapped! in Bavarian).

 The first Mass is usually served to the Bavarian Minister-President. Only local Munich breweries are allowed to serve this beer in a Bierzelt, a mammoth beer tent.

 Test-tube baby in mothers custody

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The high court on Tuesday refused to grant the custody of a one-and-a-half-year-old child, born through artificial insemination, to his US-based father and, instead, handed him over to his mother.

 Ayushs parents, Debashish and Adrija Mukherjee are locked in a divorce battle in a Pennsylvania court, in the US. But Justice Indira Banerjee of the high court ruled that a US courts order would not be effective, as the couple was married in Calcutta.

 In her petition, Adrija alleged that Debashish and his parents had been torturing her mentally and physically since her marriage in January 2001.

 The gifts and jewellery that were given to her were taken away by her mother-in-law. Her husband refused to share a physical relationship with her, said Adrijas lawyer Biswajit Basu.

 Adrija had to bear all her expenses even after settling down with her husband in the US in February 2001. She took up a job and also did her masters in telecommunication engineering from Columbia University after taking a student loan.

 When she expressed her intention to have a child, Debashish refused but finally agreed to donate his sperm. Following artificial insemination, Adrija gave birth to a boy in January 2006. The father refused to bear the expenses of the child and did not even turn up at his annyaprashan in Calcutta, Basu told the court.

 The relationship between the two soured so much that Adrija had to obtain an order of protection for her child and herself from the court of common pleas, Delaware county, Pennsylvania. 

 In June 2006, after the Mukherjees allegedly assaulted and abused Adrija and her parents at their Survey Park home, the woman filed a police complaint under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

 Debashish filed several proceedings in the Pennsylvania court. In April, he filed a divorce suit. He told Adrija to come down to the US and settle the issue, or else, he would get an ex parte order issued. It was then that she approached the city court, said Susenjit Banik, another lawyer representing Adrija.

 Hearing both parties, the court observed that Ayush required the care of his mother. In custody disputes arising out of matrimonial issues, the interest of the child is of paramount importance. This order restrains the husband, Debashish Mukherjee, from taking away the child from the lawful custody of the mother, the judge observed.

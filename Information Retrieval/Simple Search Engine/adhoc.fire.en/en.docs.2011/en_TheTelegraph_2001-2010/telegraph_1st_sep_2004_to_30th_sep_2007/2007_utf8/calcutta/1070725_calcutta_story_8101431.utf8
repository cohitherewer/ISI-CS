 Jobless youth kills self

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 21-year-old unemployed youth from Assam killed himself early on Tuesday, hours after being scolded by his mother for leaving her alone at home.

 Vinod Sharma had put up with his elder sister and brother-in-law in Jhamapukur Lane, central Calcutta.

 His mother called him up on his sisters cellphone on Monday evening and scolded him for leaving her alone in Assam. Monday was Vinods birthday and his sister had bought him a cake, said Alok Ghosh, the officer-in-charge of Amherst Street thana.

 Vinod left the house immediately after the call and returned at 9pm. He did not eat dinner and retired early. Next morning, when repeated knocks on the door went unanswered, his sister alerted neighbours, who broke open the door and found Vinod hanging from the ceiling. 

 He was rushed to Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead. 

 A preliminary probe revealed that he came to Calcutta in search of a job. He worked with a security agency for a fortnight, but lost the job.

 The police said he was depressed as he could not send money to his mother, who lives alone in Assam. His two brothers stay in Shillong.

 Bold lives, brave voices

 This time around, it wasnt just about the tales of ordinary women and their brave acts. The 2007 session of That Takes Ovaries on Thursday marked the beginning of a fresh chapter that allowed members of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) communities to step out of their closet in an inspiring story-sharing session.

 Leading A Bold Life, held on International Womens Day on the lawns of Hotel Hindusthan International, found members in the audience coming up to the mike to tell their story. 

 Leading a bold life is the first step towards individual transformation, said Mira Kakkar of Thoughtshop Foundation, which hosted the event along with Saathii, Swikriti and Spandan. Renu Roy read out short stories from Rivka Solomons book That Takes Ovaries.

 Dressed in a blue salwar kurta was Biswanath Nandi of Manas Bangla, a network of seven NGOs working for the LGBT community, who came forward to talk about the stigma of being a transgender. Stage actress Sohini Sengupta Halder was in the audience.

 Paromita, a lesbian, spoke about fighting it out with her girlfriends ex-boyfriend, while Kunal narrated his turbulent relationship with his father who could not accept he was a eunuch.

 The evening drew to a close with audience member Saira belting out Gloria Gaynors I Will Survive, which summed up the fighting spirit of the evening.

 Good ol theatre

 Souren Nag played the harmonium to an old song Aami chai na, chai na from Barbodhu just as he did in 1973, but the singer beside him at Star theatre last Wednesday was not Ketaki Dutta. The voice was Anandi Basus and the occasion was Theataari, a tribute to Bengali commercial theatre, at the Bidhan Sarani address.

 The programme was conceived and directed by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee at the food court, Sandhyatara.

 The evening began with a recording of Ketaki Duttas voice, followed by performances from a host of theatre, film and television personalities, interwoven with music. Memories came flooding back as Jagannath and Urmimala Basu read out from Subodh Ghoshs Barbodhu, the first adult play in Bengali. 

 Bijoylakshmi Burman read out a scene from DL Roys play Shahjahan, while Suchita Roychowdhury and Sujoy brought alive an extract from the 1959 thriller Ek Peyala Coffee. Sudipa Basu and RJ Sumanta presented Saheb Bibi Golam; Tamal Roy Chowdhury and Chaiti Ghoshal read out excerpts from Chowringhee.

 Manoj Mitra and his daughter Mayuri Ghosh took the stage to read his play Dampati.

 In my school days, I used to watch every single play at Star... Todays programme reminds me of those days, said Mitra.

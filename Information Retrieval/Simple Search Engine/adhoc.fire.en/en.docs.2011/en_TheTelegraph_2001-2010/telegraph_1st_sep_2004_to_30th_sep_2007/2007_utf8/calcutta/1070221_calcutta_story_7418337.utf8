 A primary school till two years ago is now functioning as a sweatshop, where children aged between 12 and 14 are toiling day in and out.

 In between, the building that still on paper houses the civic school, was rented out as a marriage hall and then as apartments.

 Though there is nothing secret about this metamorphosis of the double-storeyed building at 96/3 Collin Street, barely 100 metres from the CPM state headquarters on Alimuddin Street, the authorities at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation pleaded ignorance about it.

 There were around 1,000 students 10 years ago, but the number has dwindled to 20-30. Teachers hardly visit the school now and the students, too, have stopped coming, said Ahmed Ali, a local resident.

 Another resident alleged that local CPM and Trinamul Congress leaders, who claim to be arch rivals in the state politics, had joined hands to convert the school into a marriage hall in 2005.

 Six months ago, they rented out the premises to two families against a huge payment, the resident said. 

 Motiur Rahman, the tenant on the ground floor, has set up a leather factory in the building and employs children between 12 and 14 years of age. Rahman has even closed the main entrance of the building, prompting the other tenant to build another gate.

 Rahman claimed that the factory is legal as he pays rent regularly, but refused to divulge to whom he does.

 Asked about the school-turned-sweatshop, local Trinamul Congress councillor Iqbal Ahmed said: I do not have any idea about it. 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya expressed surprise when informed about the state of the school. This is unbelievable. I will look into the matter tomorrow.

 He said the civic authorities were trying to arrest the dwindling number of students in Corporation-run schools across the city.

 Several NGOs have been roped in to raise awareness among both students and parents. The situation has started improving, he added.

 Expressing concern over the rise in the number of drop-outs, CPM parliamentarian and West Bengal Minorities Development Finance Corporation chairman Mohammad Salim said: The trend is very alarming. We are concerned about the problems and have launched Banga Education Society to motivate students.

 Autocracy alert

 A psychologist and child rights specialist, Franck Pavloff has worked for many years in Africa and Asia, as well as in the outskirts of French cities, for the prevention of juvenile delinquency. He is also the author of many books for children, and also of novels for adults. Matin Brun, published in 2002, brought him worldwide fame. Written as a protest when the Rhone-Alps region of France leaned to the politics of the extreme right, it is an allegorical tale which denounces the insidious setting of a totalitarian state. The internationally acclaimed French author is now in Calcutta to launch the Bengali translation of this book. Published by Purple Peacock Books, Khaki: Khakir Abirvaab is highly topical to the contemporary global socio-political scenario, and cuts across the childrens book market, becoming relevant to readers of all ages. It aims to awake and sensitise readers to resist attempts at fascist rule. The book release function will be followed by a dramatised reading. Hosted by Purple Peacock Books, French Association and French Embassy in India. The book can be ordered at .

 Event: Book release of Khaki, the Bengali translation of Franck Pavloffs Matin Brun

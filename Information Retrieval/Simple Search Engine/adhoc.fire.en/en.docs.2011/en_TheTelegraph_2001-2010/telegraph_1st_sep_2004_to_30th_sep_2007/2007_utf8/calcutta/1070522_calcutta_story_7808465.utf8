 Films from Europe

 Presenting a selection of modern European cinema, the ongoing 12th European Union Film Festival aims to project the excellence of contemporary European film art. Composed of a bouquet of films that vividly reflect the cultural streams of Europe and describe European life in a certain socio-economic and cultural environment, it showcases a package of 17 films, each representing a member state of the European Union. To be screened today: Persona Non Grata (picture far right, top; Poland, 1.45 pm), A Long Weekend in Pest and Buda (picture far right, bottom; Hungary, 4.45 pm) and Small Secrets (picture above; Luxembourg, 6.30 pm). Directed by Krzysztof Zanussi, Persona Non Grata depicts the strange interplay of politics, love and betrayal against the backdrop of diplomatic relations between Russia and Poland. A Long Weekend in Pest and Buda is about a man who visits his own past and faces decisions about the three women in his life. Directed by Karoly Makk, the film creates a rich tapestry of intimate moments and human frailty. Small Secrets delivers a trip down the lane of childhood memories that is recognisable to one and all. Directed by Pol Cruchten, it provides an interesting study of mild offences in the face of church, school and parental authority.

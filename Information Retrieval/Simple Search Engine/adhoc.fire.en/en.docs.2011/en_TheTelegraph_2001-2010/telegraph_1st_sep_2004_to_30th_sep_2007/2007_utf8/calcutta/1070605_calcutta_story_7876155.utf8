The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 East-West Metro gets fresh fillip

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The East-West Metro is back on track, with the state deciding to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to implement the project.

 The state cabinet is likely to approve the SPV proposal at its June 14 meeting. The proposal will then be sent to the Centre for clearance. Officials in the transport department said the Centres clearance is expected to come around October.

 The SPV will work under the transport secretary till an official is appointed to head it.

 The economic affairs department of the Union finance ministry cleared the Rs 4,310-crore East-West project at a meeting between its officials and state transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and finance secretary Samar Ghosh in Delhi last month. The project has also been cleared by the urban development ministry.

 The Centre is expected to contribute 25 per cent to the SPV, its share coming to around Rs 800 crore. The state will bear 30 per cent of the cost, while the rest will come as soft loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).

 The Centre has made it clear that though it is willing to be part of the SPV, it will not shoulder any operational losses, said a senior transport department official.

 He also pointed out that though the Centre remains the guarantor for the loan from the Japanese bank, the principal and the interest will have to be repaid by the state.

 A fact-finding committee from Japan will fly down to Calcutta next month to make the final enquiries.

 In September, the JBIC will send its final appraisal committee, which will decide whether to finance the project or not. The final loan agreement is likely to be signed in February 2008, said an official.

 Last week, consultants engaged by the JBIC unveiled the the findings of a study that had concluded favourably on the viability of the project.

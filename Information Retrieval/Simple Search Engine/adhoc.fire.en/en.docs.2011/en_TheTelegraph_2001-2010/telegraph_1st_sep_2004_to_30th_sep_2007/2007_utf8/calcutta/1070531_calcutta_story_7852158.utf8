The Howrah administration has banned performances in bars after a brawl at Hotel Sish Mahal triggered a shootout that claimed two lives on Monday night. Sish Mahals licence has been cancelled.

 The bars cashier Dayanand Maharana was taken into custody on Wednesday, following owner Omprakash Agarwals arrest the day before.

 District magistrate Khalil Ahmed said: I have cancelled the licence of the bar for the owners failure to curb criminal activities on the premises.

 The administration has constituted a committee to probe activities at bars in the district. Twelve bars in the district had permission to host performances. 

 Police have decided to reward the two assistant sub-inspectors and the constable who chased and caught Dilip Singh, who allegedly shot dead Suren Singh and Prakash Singh outside Sish Mahal, in Alampur, on Monday night. 

 District police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh said: Samir Ghosh and Suman Chakraborty and constable Chittaranjan Maity had risked their lives. After being cornered by the three policemen, Dilip fired at and hit Ghosh.

 Dilip came to Howrah from Samastipur, Bihar, about a year ago, after stealing money from his mother, said the police superintendent.

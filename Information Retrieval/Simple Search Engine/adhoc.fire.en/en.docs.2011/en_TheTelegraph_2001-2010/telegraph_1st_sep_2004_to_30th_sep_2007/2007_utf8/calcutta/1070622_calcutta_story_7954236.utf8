 JEE bows to demand for transparency 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state joint entrance examination (JEE) board will take a series of measures to make more transparent the process of allotting seats to students on the medical merit list.

 Counselling for allotment of seats to students who have cracked JEE 2007 (medical) will be held at Sarat Sadan, in Howrah, on Saturday and Sunday.

 Our system of counselling has always been transparent, but the new measures will dispel any remaining doubts in the minds of students or guardians, a board official said on Thursday.

 An SFI delegation met Indrajit Ray, chairman of the JEE central selection committee (medical), during the day and demanded steps to usher in transparency in the counselling procedure.

 The SFI demanded that a digital display board be set up at the counselling venue to let students know about the latest vacancies in the various medical colleges.

 Any change in the seat position should be updated immediately. This will help the students take a decision quickly, said Kaustav Chatterjee, an SFI leader who was part of the delegation.

 The board has accepted our proposal and also decided to announce the seat position through the public address system, added Chatterjee.

 The SFI leaders also urged the board to direct counselling officials not to force any student to accept a seat against his/her will.

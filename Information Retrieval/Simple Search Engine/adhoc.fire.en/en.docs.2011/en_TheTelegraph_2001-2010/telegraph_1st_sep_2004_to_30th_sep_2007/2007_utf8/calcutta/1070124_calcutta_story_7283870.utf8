 The Church of North India (CNI) plans to set up branches of its premier educational institutions on the citys outskirts have started taking shape.

 To start with, CNI-controlled La Martiniere for Boys and La Martiniere for Girls will branch out in Rajarhat. A 15-acre plot will be divided equally among the two institutions to set up campus.

 The present school addresses, on Loudon Street, measure 12 acres.

 St James and Pratt Memorial schools, too, are in expansion mode and scouting for plots around Rajarhat.

 The legal procedure for getting possession of the Rajarhat plot for the La Martiniere schools is complete and a meeting will be held soon to finalise the date to start construction work, said Reverend P.S.P. Raju, bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the CNI.

 In keeping with Calcuttas go-east growth, the CNI had decided a year ago to set up branches of some of its better-known schools in Rajarhat and on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

 Our branches will have all the facilities expected of a modern school, said Sunirmal Chakraborty, principal, La Martiniere for Boys. There will be no compromise on our traditional strength imparting education for all-round development of our students.

 Chakraborty stressed that hi-tech infrastructure, mixed with La Martinieres tradition of imparting value-based education, will make the branches unique.

 The new campuses will have swimming pools, courts and indoor-games facilities. A proposal is being considered to introduce horse-riding and rowing. Besides, each classroom will have computers with Internet connection.

 A source in the diocese said construction is likely to start in the next six months. The schools will start admitting students to the junior classes by end-2008, the source added.

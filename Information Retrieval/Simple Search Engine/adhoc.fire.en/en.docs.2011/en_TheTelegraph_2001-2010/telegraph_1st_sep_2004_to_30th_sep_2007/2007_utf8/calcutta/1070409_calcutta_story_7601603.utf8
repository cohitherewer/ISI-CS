 Force keeps mum on killing of cross-dresser

 PRONAB MONDAL 

 A three-week-old mystery murder kept under wraps by the investigative agencies has once again trained the spotlight on the murkier side of the Maidan. 

 Two constables of Hastings police station saw something unusual around 5.30 pm on March 18. At a distance, they spotted someone running down the pavement of St Georges Gate Road and suddenly fall down. The duo rushed to the spot. They found a man dressed as a woman with a slashed abdomen, profusely bleeding.

 The constables took the man, later identified as Ronald DSilva, to SSKM Hospital, where the 32-year-old succumbed to his injuries. 

 Ronald was a cross-dresser and a regular in the citys party circuit, said an officer of Hastings police station, adding that the man was found in tight jeans, a floral top and womens innerwear. 

 Though a murder case was registered, the Lalbazar police headquarters learnt about the incident 10 days after Ronalds death. We learnt about the case more than a week after it took place. But we have told the local police station to carry out a full-fledged investigation, said Pradeep Kumar Chatterjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 But Ronalds family has complained of reluctance among the investigators in cracking the daylight murder on Calcuttas patch of green. 

 Anjali DSilva, the victims mother, has made several rounds of the police station to find out who killed her son. 

 But they just repeat their answer that the killing might have been the act of a mentally-deranged person, whom they are trying to trace, rued the mother, sitting in her two-room flat in Topsias dingy Abinash Chowdhury Lane. 

 Hours before Ronald was killed, he had accompanied his mother for Sunday prayers to a Hastings church. After the prayers, I came back home and he went somewhere else. He never came back, she recounted, in tears. 

 Anjali, who lost her husband in 1993, was aware of Ronalds fancy for dressing like a woman. He was about 15 when Ronald started behaving like a girl Then, he started dressing like one. I chided him several times, but it did not work, said Anjali, mother of two. Her daughter is married. 

 According to preliminary investigations, Ronald Bobby to his friends could be seen at various hangout zones in the Park Street-Camac Street-Theatre Road belt till late into weekend nights. 

 It appears that someone took Ronald to an isolated spot near Vidyasagar Setus ramps and murdered him after discovering he was not a woman, said an officer, on condition of anonymity. 

 If a thorough probe is conducted, fresh skeletons like the rise in prostitution and other illegal activities on the Maidan will tumble out, added the officer. 

 Even sleuths of the detective departments homicide wing, which deals with murder cases, did not show any interest in the case. The matter is being looked into by Hastings police station. We have not taken charge of the investigation, said an official. 

 But Anjali is still hopeful of getting justice.

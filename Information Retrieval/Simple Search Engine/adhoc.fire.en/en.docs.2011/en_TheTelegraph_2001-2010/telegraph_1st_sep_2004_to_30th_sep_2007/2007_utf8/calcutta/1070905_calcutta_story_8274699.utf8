 The city is set to host the 34th national management convention, organised by the All India Management Association (Aima) in collaboration with the Asian Association of Management Organisation (AAMO). The event will be held at The Oberoi Grand from September 6 to 8. 

 It is the emerging Indian economy with new challenges and issues that we intend to focus upon. Indian businessmen should have an understanding of the complexities of these issues to face the challenges ahead, said Kamal Singh, the director of Aima.

 Eastern India is emerging as an industrial hub and Calcutta is at the centre of it all, so it made sense to host the convention here, added Singh.

 The convention will discuss ways to develop management systems to utilise the resources available within the country to make India an economic superpower.

 Sanjiv Goenka, the vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, will be the chairman of the meet. The co-chairman will be B. Muthuraman, the managing director of Tata Steel. 

 Speakers at the convention will include Willem L.J. Brocker, a senior global adviser of PricewaterhouseCoopers International, J.J. Irani, the president of AAMO and a director of Tata Sons, Praful Patel, the Union minister for civil aviation, Subir Raha, the president of Aima, and Alan Rosling, the executive director of Tata Sons. 

 The meet is being preceded by the Asian Management Games, which provides young managers across Asia an opportunity to hone their skills. Seven teams from five countries Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau and India are participating in the competition.

 The winners will get the chance to participate in the Global Management Games.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 German team eyes business ties

 Millennium City, a prominent IT building in Sector V. The German biz team has chosen Calcutta over Bangalore for IT

 Amid the swirling unease post-Nandigram, a little cheer was spread on Wednesday by a biz team from Germanys most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia, with promises to look way beyond the current situation and forge enduring ties.

 Earlier, the only recall we had of Calcutta was Mother Teresa and the Ganges. Now we know its a booming city, much in sync with European culture and with great business opportunities, Wulf-Christian Ehrich, managing director, international department of the Dortmund Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told Metro.

 Ehrich, leading the IT group in the 21-strong German delegation, added they were looking for joint-venture partners and have chosen Calcutta over a saturated Bangalore in IT. During the two-day visit, the IT, services and steel groups will hold partnership meetings, with a trip to Durgapur Steel Plant scheduled for Thursday.

 The highly-skilled and dedicated workforce in Bengal would be a serious consideration for German companies, Gnter Wehrmann, German consul-general in Calcutta, said in his welcome address. Wehrmann felt while German business was keeping a keen eye on Nandigram, the present situation was unlikely to affect long-term business ties.

 They are looking at the bigger picture, which remains bright. The key is to take the people with you and then, the venture has to succeed, the consul-general stressed. His views were echoed by P.M. Narielvala, eastern region chairman of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce (IGCC).

 Democracy is also about peoples participation in the decision-making process. Somewhere down the line, we forget to involve the people. However, our fundamentals are strong and stable to overcome such hiccups, the veteran taxation expert observed.

 State tourism secretary G.D. Gautama promised the German team all possible assistance, underlining Indias status as a knowledge superpower and the contribution of Calcuttas mid-range software firms to major global projects. We have made a start. Its now important to consolidate, he added.

 IGCC regional director B.G. Roy felt the consolidation has started happening with such focused teams now looking at Calcutta and Bengal. We have had a steady flow of German business groups since 2005, and the fruits have started showing. Apart from Metro Cash amp; Carry and Lufthansa, two tie-ups have already been inked following the visit of the Saarland team, Roy said.

 Satish K. Batra, president of the Horizon group of companies, and residing in Germany for over 45 years, felt in any democratic set-up, protests would happen.

 We know the crisis (at Nandigram) will blow over and Bengals core strength in steel and knowledge can be leveraged, said Batra, leading the steel group.

 With the volume of bilateral trade with Germany topping 10 billion Euros three years ahead of target, the outlook is buoyant. The states participation in German trade fairs of late has served to correct perception further, Roy felt.

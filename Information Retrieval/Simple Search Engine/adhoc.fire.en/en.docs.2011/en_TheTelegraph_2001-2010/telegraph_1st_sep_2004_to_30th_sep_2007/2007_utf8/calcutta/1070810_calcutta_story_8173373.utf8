The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 JEE scam kingpin had made crores

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mihir Kumar Jha, the alleged kingpin of the joint entrance examination (JEE) scam, had amassed crores, a chunk of which was invested in immovable assets, police said on Thursday.

 The sleuths, however, are yet to unravel details of Jhas financial transactions, apart from figuring out that the former student of Medical College used to collect cash from customers.

 The details are necessary to find out the number of candidates who had tried to gain admission to medical colleges through the racket, said an officer working on the case.

 Jha is intelligent. Unlike Ranvijay Pathak, he has not kept any record of his transactions, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Whatever little details we have suggest that Jha has amassed Rs 1 lakh, which is nothing compared to the money he has made, he added.

 Interrogating Jha for the past couple of days, the police have learnt that most of the dummies he had fielded in JEE 2007 were brought from Patna, where he used to run a coaching centre. 

 Most of the dummies are MBBS students, who were put up in the city at two lodges on Mahatma Gandhi Road. The sleuths are trying to reach the dummies with the help of the addresses they had written in the lodge registers.

 Jha has claimed that MBBS students from the city were reluctant to appear in the JEE for fear of being caught. But we are sure that a few from Calcutta had appeared in the postgraduate entrance test in Bangalore as dummy candidates, Kumar claimed.

 Apart from the inputs being provided by those arrested, the sleuths are banking on letters, mostly from medical students, containing information about Jha and Pathak.

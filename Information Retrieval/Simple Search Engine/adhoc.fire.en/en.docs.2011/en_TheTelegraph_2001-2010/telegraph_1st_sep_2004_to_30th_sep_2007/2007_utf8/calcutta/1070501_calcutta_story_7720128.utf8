 Cover drive for men in blue 

 - Extra security in hotel and on pitch to guard Team India

 KINSUK BASU

 Security ring to keep the fans at bay. Extra security to keep the furious away. As Team India captain Rahul Dravid and his band of boys checked into a city hotel on Monday evening for the five-day conditioning camp before the Bangladesh tour, an unprecedented security cover was thrown around them. 

 Given the mood of the fans after the debacle in the World Cup, we cannot take chances, said a senior police official, looking after the security of the men in blue. 

 Extra deployment of policemen in the hotel, separate escort cars for player movement outside the hotel, special security team to shadow players and severe restrictions at Eden Gardens during the workout cops are ready with a long list of play-safe measures.

 Every minute detail has been taken care of, said Prasun Mukherjee, city police commissioner and Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president.

 On Monday, Vineet Goyel, deputy commissioner (Special Branch) held a meeting with senior officers of the special protection staff the dedicated unit for VIP protection and the final security blue-print was chalked out. Later, senior officers turned up at the Eden Gardens to take stock of the situation. 

 Key functionaries of the team like captain Dravid, coach Ravi Shastri and some senior players will be given separate escort cars for any movement outside the hotel.

 The cars for the purpose have already been requisitioned. This is a deviation from our norm, said a senior officer of the Special Branch.

 A team of constables will accompany a player, just in case he wants to step out of the hotel. In the past, several players had left the hotel without any security cover. At no point of time will any member of the team be outside the security scanner, said the officer.

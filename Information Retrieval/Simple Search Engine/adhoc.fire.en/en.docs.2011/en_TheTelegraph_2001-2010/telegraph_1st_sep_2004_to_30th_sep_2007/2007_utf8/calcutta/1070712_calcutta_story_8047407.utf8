 State eyes bio-tech centre

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 The state government plans to set up a medical genetics centre in the city to promote studies in genetically induced diseases and their treatment, Surjya Kanta Mishra, the minister in charge of the newly-created department of biotechnology, told the state Assembly on Wednesday.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has written to the Prime Minister, seeking the Centres help for setting up the centre, said Mishra.

 Even if we dont get the central support right now, the state government will initiate the project on its own, Mishra added. 

 The minister welcomed foreign investment in bio-tech industries in the state and said that the government will be offering attractive incentives to prospective companies. 

 A provision of Rs 4.5 crore has been made for the incentive schemes in the Rs 6-crore departmental budget for the current fiscal, he said.

 The bio-tech policy of our state will be updated with the aim to make it more comprehensive and in tune with all emerging possibilities, said Mishra. This includes the promotion of bio-tech parks, like the one cradled by IIT Kharagpur.

 Were not in favour of a blanket ban on genetically modified seeds or crops. But there have to be regulations in place to maintain bio-safety and food security. We welcome a debate on the issue, Mishra signed off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech campus on track

 MITA MUKHERJEE

With technology becoming the thrust area in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal, Calcutta University is setting up a dedicated technology campus in Salt Lake.

 Two seven-storeyed buildings, an international-standard guest house, separate administrative block and a state-of-the-art auditorium the tech cradle will have all the facilities of a modern campus. 

 Construction work is on schedule and we are expecting that a portion of the campus will be ready by 2007-end and we can shift some of our departments by the end of this year, said Shyamal Sarkar, secretary of the science and technology faculty. 

 Eight departments of the universitys

 technology faculty are located on its Rajabazar Science

 College campus, in north Calcutta, which is also the

 address of 16 basic science departments .

 With over 2,500 students of 24 departments sharing the five-acre campus, the authorities found it difficult to roll out new courses or set up facilities, mandatory for an institute of advanced learning. 

 Since there is no proper place to hold campus interviews, some companies do not visit our university, while they go to Jadavpur University. We hope this situation will change with the new campus, said a B.Tech student. 

 The authorities promise the 4.2-acre new campus will be equipped with modern facilities and all the eight technology departments will be shifted to Salt Lake in one-and-a-half years. The workshops, laboratories and libraries will be state-of-the-art, said a senior university official. 

 Apart from endowments, the state and central governments will chip in with funds for setting up the new campus of the 150-year-old university. 

 A new technology campus does not mean that basic sciences will be neglected, stressed the university officials. 

 The basic sciences departments will also get the necessary support to carry out research More elbow room on the present campus will help them, said an official of the university.

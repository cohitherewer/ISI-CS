 Bratya Basu and Kanchana in Hemlat: The Prince of Garanhata 

 Some years ago, Bratya Basu made a name as the enfant terrible of Bengali drama. This year, two out of three of his plays (with one more to go) have been just plain terrible. We may justifiably think that he spreads his undoubted talents too thin, writing too much and perhaps too fast.

 The most ambitious among them, Hemlat: The Prince of Garanhata, directed by him for Swapnasuchana, bungee-jumps off Shakespeare in the manner that only Bratya can. The vowel dyslexia gives Hamlets name the right downwardly-mobile Bengali inflection and, indeed, the first half has much to commend it as Bratya, through his corruption and displacement of Hamlet, holds a mirror to the corrupt society and decaying gentry of Calcutta.

 Hemlat belongs to a decrepit north-Calcutta family. His uncouth, profiteering uncle Kadu killed his catatonic father, whose sole excitement in life was old Hindi films. The neighbouring Paul, who loves his drink, has a wastrel son Lachchu and a daughter Shephali (a stronger equivalent of Ophelia), Hemlats lover. Unnecessarily, Bratya provides her with a sister who does precious little. 

 Hemlats friend, Harish, counsels him to no avail. In this pattern of nomenclature, why Bratya names Hemlats mother Manorama, when Gayatri was there for the taking, defies my reasoning.

 Although Bratya claims inspiration from a critic who profoundly referred to Hamlet as a play of ideas, things start deviating with insignificant new characters like the local councillor and promoter. The conclusion presents three male generations of Hemlats lineage, the youngest, though illegitimate, a symbol of hope for the future. Even here, Bratya creates possibilities with a flashback of the young hero and Shephali as schoolchildren, but ultimately not only does no sense of tragedy emerge, rather the play fades into nothing like the Woyzeck-like antihero, progressively wasting away and rendered mute. Bratya could have profitably rethought the second half.

 His acting in the lead evaporates like the role itself. Ironically, Rudratej Sengupta leaves the lasting impression as Kadu, all brawn and little brain, perhaps in keeping with Bratyas message that the meek shall definitely not inherit Calcutta. Shankar Debnath has designed an interesting multipurpose two-tier set.

 Bratya directed his own Page 4: Its Also a Game for Lokkrishti, and this is really much ado about nothing. He has a flair for satire, but it can easily degenerate into pointless fluff. Here, he paints Bengali art and culture as an underworld where mafia ganglords fight over turf and determine award winners. This may hold some truth, but by reducing it to absurd farce Bratya loses his chance to shoot to kill.

 The same trouble affects Operation 2010, which he mercifully does not direct. Unfortunately, Abhi Chakrabarti of Natyamukh from Ashoknagar (North 24-Parganas) directs even worse. This time Bratyas concept is pure fantasy: India playing in the next football World Cup. 

 As with Page 4 , the subject of our soccer woes is serious business, deserving either intense or scathing treatment, but Bratya merely has light fun.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A holiday for the master

 The private lives of celebrities may belong to the public domain, but they come with a price. They are to be used selectively. At least that is the norm. Not that everyone abides by it. The Picasso heirs, among them the jewellery and cosmetics designer Paloma Picasso, who lends her name to toiletries, were once given a dressing down for reducing the modern master to a piece of merchandise.

 But what would the custodians of the legacy of the other art icon of those times, Salvador Dali, say if they chanced upon a billboard above a public toilet near Girish Park? The billboard stands proudly above a Sulabh Shouchalay, with Dalis famous eyes glaring out of it, though the moustache meeting in a perfect arc with the eyebrow is left out. What could he be endorsing? A cheap holiday. Would the 20th Century great who led a lavish life have a taste for cheap holidays? For persistence of memory, the Philadelphia Museum of Art had laid out an outsized blow-up of the same photograph on its steps for its 2005 Salvador Dali exhibition. 

 Left out

 Artist Gobardhan Ash was lucky that at least a private gallery took the trouble of organising an exhibition to celebrate his birth centenary. More well-known names have escaped the attention in their home states. Earlier this year, an exhibition in honour of Benodebehari Mukherjee on his 100th birth anniversary was held at Gaganendra Pradarshashala. But that looked like mere tokenism as it did not seem much concerned about his multi-faceted talent.

 Only the huge exhibition held in New Delhi at the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) this winter did justice to the genius of this artist. Of course, if wags are to be believed, the exhibition got the green light only after the ministry concerned realised that Mukherjee used to be the mastermoshai of Indira Gandhi, too, in her Santiniketan days.

 Quite expectedly, the wonderful NGMA exhibition has in all probability bypassed Calcutta, the city where Mukherjee was born in Behala. This in spite of the best efforts of Gulam Sheikh, Baroda-based artist and teacher, and art historian Shiv Kumar, the two men whose tireless efforts made the NGMA exhibition possible. But without any initiative from the culturati of Calcutta how can the city even hope to see the best collection of Mukherjees works? Maybe he needs right marketing. Will highlighting the fact that he was also Satyajit Rays teacher on whom Ray had made the documentary, The Inner Eye, help? 

 Documentary talent

 Benodebehari Mukherjee 

 Debu Bhattacharyya formed Theme Entertainment to make high quality documentaries. By high quality he means aesthetically appealing, technically advanced and revenue-earning. Smart thinking, that, and the 28-year-old has already been selected as the India finalist for British Councils International Young Film Entrepreneur of the year Award. The finals will be held in London. 

 Bhattacharyya, who is from Calcutta, has specialised in film direction from SRFTI. He has strong views. But he doesnt want to mix production and direction. 

 The young entrepreneur admits that there is little demand for shorts in India. There are 183 channels in India and only DD National has a weekly half-an-hour slot for documentaries, he says.

 He also speaks candidly about the way docus are made. Most documentaries are one-man shows, but I believe in having a proper team, so that each can concentrate on his bit, he says. His first set of four documentaries are set to release in the middle of next year. 

 Downward ho

 It is something to do with the Calcuttans spirit, it seems, of going against the grain. Or swimming against the tide. Frequently at Metro stations, at the head of an upwardly-mobile escalator that leads to the exit, is spied a figure who wants to sprint down. Its no point telling him that the stairs are only meant to go up. Or that racing down stairs that are moving up can be dangerous for the others who are not defying convention. But there is something magical about these sprinters. One such young man, who had positioned himself above a Chandni Chowk escalator the other day, ready to fly down, was severely told off by a passenger and was bundled out. But he seemed to leap across Central Avenue with that speed, as if he was acting in a scene from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. There are Supermen all around us.

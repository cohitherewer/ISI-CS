 Therapy pushes parents to penury

 A bigha of farm land that Sutapa and Tapan Maity own was mortgaged long ago. Now, the couple sees no option but to sell it.

 All because state-run hospitals, even the premier ones, do not have the infrastructure to treat the Maitys three-year-old son Lokesh, who has been suffering from an acute form of paralysis, called Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS).

 The couple from Ramnagar, in Midnapore East, was forced to admit the child to a private hospital in Calcutta. He is much better now, but the bill Rs 2.34 lakh has prompted the parents to contemplate selling the mortgaged land to raise the money.

 We have already taken a huge loan to meet the cost of treatment. Now, to pay the final bill, we will have sell our land, said Tapan, a daily-wager.

 In February, Lokesh first exhibited the symptoms of GBS an ascending paralysis starting in the lower part of the body and spreading to the upper part, at times involving the vital brain centres as well. Within days, he had no sensation in the left leg and the left eye had shrunk.

 He was brought to BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children, where doctors administered him intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). But the paralysis kept spreading upwards, affecting the respiratory muscles. 

 The child had to be put immediately on a ventilator, but the states only referral hospital for children doesnt have one. We were directed to SSKM Hospital, where doctors said no ventilator was free. With time running out, we had to admit Lokesh to AMRI Hospital, Dhakuria, recalled Sutapa.

 At AMRI, too, he was treated with IVIG. But it had no effect, prompting us to put the boy on plasmafiltration, said Jayati Sengupta, who treated Lokesh at AMRI.

 The parents contacted SSKM again, this time for plasmafiltration, but were told the procedure was too expensive for a state-run hospital. Lokesh finally underwent the treatment at AMRI.

 He can now move his hands and try to eat on his own, though complete rehabilitation will take some time, Sengupta said.

 The parents are happy that their son is saved, though the shadow of a financial disaster looms large. The hospital authorities have promised a major discount, but that will hardly help the couple. We do not know how we will survive, said Sutapa.

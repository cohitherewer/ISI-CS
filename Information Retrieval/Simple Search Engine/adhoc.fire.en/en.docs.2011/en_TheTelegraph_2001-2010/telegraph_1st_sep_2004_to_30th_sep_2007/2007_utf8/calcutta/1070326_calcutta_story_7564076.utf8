 A STAFF REPORTER

 Come June, Calcuttas TV viewers will get their third choice after CAS and Direct-to-Home (DTH).

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) on Sunday announced the roadmap for the introduction of its Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) in the city. The service is ready for launch. It will be on trial for two months and the commercial launch has been scheduled for June, said S.K. Chakravarty, chief general manager, Calcutta Telephones.

 An IPTV subscriber will be able to see 100 TV channels and also avail of video-on-demand, telephone and high-speed Internet services.

 Any BSNL landline customer can subscribe to IPTV by buying or hiring a special set-top box, which will be much smaller than the conventional variety.

 BSNL premiered the service in Pune on March 15, in collaboration with MKCL (Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Ltd.) and Divinet, which provides the content.

 Calcutta, Chennai and Bangalore have been identified for the second phase roll-out, said A.K. Sinha, chief managing director of BSNL, who was in town on Sunday to launch a voice SMS service for landline and CellOne customers and a multi-party video conferencing facility.

 Officials said BSNL will spend around Rs 800 crore to introduce the service in 900 cities across the country.

 In Calcutta, subscribers will be able to watch 30 movies a month free. For more, they will have to pay between Rs 5 and Rs 10 for each movie, Chakravarty said.

 In the voice SMS service, a subscriber can record a message in any language up to 45 seconds, paying the charge of one call. For availing of the service, a subscriber has to dial 1256 from a BSNL phone.

 The multi-party video conferencing facility will benefit software professionals, business houses, educational institutions and hospitals, said Sinha. Two studios are being set up in Salt Lake and BBD Bag to run the facility. The official also announced that BSNL will introduce convergent billing in a year.

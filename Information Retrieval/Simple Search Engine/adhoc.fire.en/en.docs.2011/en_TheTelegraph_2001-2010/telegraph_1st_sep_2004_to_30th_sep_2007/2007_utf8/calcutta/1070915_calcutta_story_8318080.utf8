The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Little contestants at the virtual lawn tennis competition show off their trophies

 A virtual slam

 Calcutta kids had their first tryst with virtual lawn tennis 

 on Saturday and Sunday. ITC put up a virtual court at City 

 Centre as a prelude to the third edition of Sunfeast Open. 

 The $175,000 tournament begins at the Netaji Indoor Stadium 

 on September 17.

 It felt like I was playing in a grand slam final. The atmosphere was electric and the virtual audience was cheering at the top of its lungs, said Sukanya Mitra, a Class V student of GSS Girls High School, who won a cutout of a trophy and a goodybag. 

 Participants, young and old, played virtual doubles matches, with both teams looking into two back-to-back LCD screens, each facing one team. The screen showed animated versions of the opposition standing on the other side of the court. All four players had remote controls in their hands, which were acting as tennis rackets. 

 There was a giant screen as well, in which the live audience could watch an animated version of the match in progress. 

 If school and college kids flocked to the miniature court, many parents too were very keen to have a go at the sport. I have always wanted to play tennis but never got around to doing so. After all, in this city, you cant just drop in and play a few games anywhere you please. So, this was wish fulfilment for me though it took a lot of willing suspension of disbelief, said Pradip Chowdhury, 41, who had formed a team with his nine-year-old son.

 With the recently-concluded US Open tournament providing some high-voltage tennis and Sunfeast Open ready to ride high on glamour and talent, the city is surely warming up to the sport.

 Precious gift

 It was a gift from the old to the young generation. Members of the alumni association of South Suburban Branch School helped start a computer centre in the school recently. This will help students to upgrade their skills. The institute will provide all services, said Suniti Chatterjee, an alumnus. 

 Currently, the computer centre has three machines. The alumni association of South Suburban Branch School that started in 1926, helps in the development of the school. The association has plans to build a games room in the school premises.

 The Diary

 Rain scribbles here

 Drops of rain 

 Ethereal they are. 

 Listen to the voice of nature 

 That whispers 

 With a melancholic sadness; 

 As an orchestra plays 

 The unmatched rhythm 

 And with unfathomable continuity...

 My mind surrenders 

 To the heavenly imagery 

 Coming from the oblivious doorway... 

 That of His.

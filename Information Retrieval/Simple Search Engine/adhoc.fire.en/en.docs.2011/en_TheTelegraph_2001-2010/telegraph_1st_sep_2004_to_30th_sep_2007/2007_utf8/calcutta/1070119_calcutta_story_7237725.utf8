 Sore sight for eyes 

Apropos the report Queues longer than at zoo to view House vandalism, December 2, the vandalism at the Assembly by the so-called responsible representatives of the people was a reprehensible act. In the past, members of the House from the Left had torn books, thrown objects and insulted the Speaker. But Mamata and the members of her party have outdone everyone. I wonder how the legislators explained their action to their children. The incident has revealed them to be the ruffians they are. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Bandpur, Hooghly.

 Apropos the report City sulks, Bristol beams, December 8, it is good to know that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has made an initiative to preserve sites abroad that are associated with great sons of Bengal. However, one cant but point out that many such heritage sites in the city are languishing in neglect. Recently, the house of Rani Rashmoni in Janbazar collapsed due to lack of maintenance. And there are many other houses awaiting a similar fate. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report Painter, poet, writer, spy, December 6, London-based journalist Sraboni Basus meticulous research has brought to life the story of the greatgranddaughter of Tipu Sultan, Noor Inayat Khan. An account of her colourful life deserves to be preserved. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park.

 In a world driven by materialism, it is heartening to come across someone like autorickshaw driver Ratan Chakraborty (An honest, ordinary man, December 9). Despite financial hardships, he did not yield to the temptation of pocketing a folder filled with cash. I wish, like Chakraborty, everyone believed that adopting dishonest means would become an impediment in the fulfilment of their dreams. The world then would become a better place to live in. Honesty is moving, especially in the face of poverty. 

 Purnima Vasudeva,

 Rowland Road.

 In a society where corruption is rampant and the majority is out to make a quick buck, it is a matter of pride that there still exist individuals who can look temptation in the face and say no. The autorickshaw driver should indeed be felicitated. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park.

 The report Realty rape of Ramsar site, December 11, was most disturbing. One fails to understand why the chief minister is bent on destroying the ecological balance despite serious objections by the minister of land and land reforms. The government has allowed the land sharks to build huge housing estates on the wetlands in violation of all ecological norms. Of late, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees actions appear dictatorial, which is not good for the state. If he doesnt change his policies, he will be remembered as the destroyer of wetlands in the state. 

 A.S. Mehta,

 New Alipore.

 Apropos the report Splendid sheen, December 4, it is thrilling to learn that skilful lighting would conjure a moonlight sheen around Victoria Memorial. Given that the Memorial is one of the most loved landmarks of Calcutta, the authorities concerned should take steps to make the angel atop the dome twirl. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia.

 Apropos the report Boy death sparks rampage, December 1, patient death from alleged medical negligence, followed by physical assault on doctors and vandalism at the clinic concerned by family members of the victim have become routine affairs. Doctor bashing and vandalism can never be supported even if there has been medical neglect. Unless the government and healthcare administrators realise the underlying reason for unlawful behaviour by ordinary people and take remedial measures, hospital violence is not going to go away. 

 Kunal Saha,

 Ohio, US.

 It is heartening to note that the number of patients at the nature cure centre in Mourigram, Howrah, is fast going up (Nature cure within reach of every man, December 5). Ayurvedas environment-friendly methods offer effective treatment. Another factor that has contributed to its popularity is the high cost of allopathic treatment. The government should set up more ayurveda centres. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 The photograph with the caption Trotting through traffic, December12, highlights the pitiable condition we Calcuttans live and work in. Bandhs that bring life to a halt are being called every couple of weeks. Now, we have these agitations that are nothing but torture for the common man. In this scenario, one can only pity the people who are trying to work. 

 Kalyan Ghosh,

 Ballygunge. 

 The farce in the name of bandh has robbed thousands of Calcuttans of their daily bread (Cold shoulder to shutdown, December 6). How long will the tamasha continue? 

 K.K. Ahmed,

 Lalbazar Street.

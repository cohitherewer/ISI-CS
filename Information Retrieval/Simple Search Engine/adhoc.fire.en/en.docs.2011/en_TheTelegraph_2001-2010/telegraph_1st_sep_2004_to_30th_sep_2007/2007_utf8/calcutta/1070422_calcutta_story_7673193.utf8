 Spare the child

 In the nuclear family, the role of parents has changed.

 For many young couples, parenting is not something that happens on its own. It needs to be worked out and with enough respect for the child. A report

 Hitting a toddler is banned. It is always better to show a positive attitude. Never use foul language. If you drink and smoke, tell your child that what you are holding in your hand is a drink, and the white stick between your fingers is a cigarette and children should stay away from it. Follow a good book on child psychology. Treat him like your friend. Write blogs on motherhood, fatherhood and parenting. 

 Its not that rules have relaxed, but new-age parenting for young urban couples is far different from, well, parenting, thanks to an information boom in the sector. Knowledge drawn from traditional sources, didima or dadima or the extended family, is passe. They have been replaced by books, the Net, peer groups, the couples individuality and the children themselves, who are knowing and demanding. It makes parenting not something that just happens, but a management mantra. 

 Things to do

 For a lot of young couples parenting is not just something that should be left to instinct. It is something that needs to get done and be done effectively, says Atashi Gupta, a city-based psychologist. Hence many turn to books, not just on parenting but also on child psychology. 

 It starts at the very beginning. 

 I read five books on pregnancy, childbirth and pre- and post-natal depression when I was pregnant. There was nothing I didnt know. In the operating theatre, I was completely relaxed, says Sharmistha Pal, a private insurance company employee and an enlightened mother. And I knew I was going to have a boy before the birth, because they had done up the babys cot in blue, the boys colour. 

 Web wisdom and books

 Websites add to the knowledge. Among the numerous parenting websites, several are Indian. One of them, www.indianparenting.com, copiously lists the several ages of childhood. 

 Planning a baby, says the website, involves sex education, fertility issues, preconception and adoption. Parents of babies should know what new born care is its all about crying, diapering and grooming, bowel and bladder, bathing, babys sleeping, laundry. The babys diet involves information on all about breast feeding, bottle feeding, introduction of solids. Child development includes physical and intellectual development, teething, motor skills, speech-hearing-vision, social behaviour, toilet training. The advice extends up to teenage. 

 Earlier parents were not aware of proper parenting guidelines. But todays mums are conscious about the right way to bring up a child, says Anasuya Mandal, mother of two, who runs a kindergarten school.

 I think books help parents to know their children better. I follow a book called Time Life Series: Early Learning Programme, says Tandrima Bhattacharya, a working mother of a two-and-half-year old child. 

 The bookstores admit the rising demand of childcare books. The sale of such books has gone up in the last five years, says B. Kannan, store manager of Crossword. The perennial favourite of the parents is Dr Spock, a renowned child psychologist. Other books in demand are Johnsons Baby and Mother Care, What to expect series. Some books by Indian authors like L.C. Guptas Mother and ChildCare are also available. But clients mostly hunt for books by foreign authors, says Sridhar Ranganathan, store manager, Oxford Bookstore. The books range from Rs 200 to Rs 1,000. 

 Wisdom from the books can challenge the family doctor. Conflicting information from books read before pregnancy and the doctor leads to unnecessary mental stress, says Gupta.

 Several young parents are having a tough time balancing the new-age tips and age-old wisdom. Who does one listen to? Ones mother, or friends and the printed word? Parents are caught between keeping up with modern practices, the growing demand of children and conflicting advice, says Gupta. 

 Consensus

 But every young parent seems to agree on certain things. Parents should not be threatening, but be friendly with their children, says Rupali Dutta Majumdar, mother of 12-year-old Prantik. When the child misbehaves, the prescription is patience. If my child is misbehaving, I explain to him the consequences of doing so. Being strict doesnt mean that I have to hit or scold the child, says Soha Maitra, an NGO-worker and a mother of a four-and-a-half-year-old. 

 The elders, however, not exposed to such tolerance, are prone to bewilderment. 

 In the nuclear family, the role of parents has changed, says sociologist Prasanta Roy. They are apprehensive of emotional repercussions if they are too strict. So corporal punishment is out. No one asks children questions like why are you on the telephone for such long hours. 

 He points out another reason. Ads are aimed at children as upcoming consumers and they have a role in making choices for themselves and for the family, says Roy. It leads to early sovereignty for the child, he says. 

 Children are more aware. My daughter will not listen to anything if it is forced on her, but explain it to her logically, and she understands, says Poushali Mittal, mother of five-year-old Vandita. She feels that while earlier children were more content spending time with themselves, now they crave for attention. 

 Especially if the parents are working. I go out to work, so does my husband. My daughter hardly gets to spend time with us. As a result when we are at home she becomes very demanding, she says.

 I cant check mail without her coming up and demanding to play games on the computer. She resents the attention shifting from her, says Poushali.

 Sometimes parents are over-involved. Possessive parents often do more bad than good. The child loses self-confidence and becomes more dependent on his parents, says Tapashi Mitra, psychologist. The child becomes rebellious. 

 Ways out

 Not that there arent ways out, assure some. New-age or not, rules dont work beyond a point.

 It doesnt matter whether one consults books to raise a child. Parents should always try to have a balanced attitude. A child should be made aware of the limits of his or her demands, says Soha Maitra. 

 New support systems are evolving. Mitul Sarkar, an e-learning consultant, left journalism and night shifts for her son Aritro, seven. But when she had to stay in Mumbai for four months for work, her husband, a journalist himself, was a great help. When I was in Mumbai, he took on Aritros responsibility. 

 But as she also points out, it is still women who have to adjust their lives when the kid arrives. Sarkar had started a blog called Mums the Word, which is lying in neglect now.

 Updated Rule book

 Always try to explain things to your child

 Have a positive attitude and don rsquo;t scold the child in front of outsiders

 Question the child about his or her likes and dislikes 

 Do not shower costly gifts all the time

 Do not always oblige

 Be patient and do not get angry about small things

 Do not highlight the child rsquo;s weaknesses

 Try to be a good friend to your child, more than a good parent

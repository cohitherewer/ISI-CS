The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bashed up in Buddha backyard

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The chief ministers neighbourhood again erupted in violence on Tuesday night, with three youths being bashed up by a gang on Bondel Gate Road.

 Police allegedly refused to register a complaint, but relented only after local residents threatened to report the matter to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 The three youths were beaten up for resisting extortion attempts by the gang, said Sushanta Mohanty, a member of the CPM local committee.

 He alleged that criminal activities have been on the rise in the high-profile and high-security neighbourhood over the past year. 

 The police have remained a mute spectator to the worsening law and order condition. In fact, a section of cops has been hand in glove with the criminals, said Mohanty.

 The Bondel Gate flyover has become a crime den. Goons from other parts of the city gather there at night and drink sitting right in the middle of the flyover, he added.

 Tuesdays incident took place around 9pm, when Arun Ghosh, a resident of Hajipara 300 m from Bhattacharjees Palm Avenue residence had gone to Bondel Gate Road to buy vegetables.

 A group of criminals, led by someone identified as Capsule, accosted him and demanded money from him. As Ghosh refused, the gang beat him up with bamboo poles.

 A bleeding Ghosh returned to his locality and narrated the incident to neighbours, who accompanied him back to the spot. The group spotted Capsule and his associates sitting beside a tea stall and challenged them.

 Outnumbered, Ghosh and his friends were thrashed by Capsules men. Arjun and Partho Haldar were critically injured and had to be admitted to National Medical College and Hospital.

 Youths from Hajipara rushed to Gariahat police station, but officers there reportedly refused to register a complaint.

 Later, a group of 40 from Hajipara and Bondel Gate Road went back to the thana to protest the police inaction.

 It was 2am when we visited the police station for the second time with our complaint. The officers were still reluctant to act. They got scared and, finally, agreed to record the complaint when we told them that we would report the matter to the chief minister. We will surely take up the issue with the higher authorities, said a local resident.

 According to a section of residents, the area has become a haven for criminals enjoying political patronage. Extortion, snatching and clashes have become routine, said a neighbour of Ghosh.

 Nobody has been arrested. Raids are being conducted and we have detained some local youths, said an officer of Gariahat police station.

 Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner (south), said he was not aware of the incident.

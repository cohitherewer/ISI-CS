 Dilly-dally denies CU 100 crores

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A Rs 100-crore central purse for Calcutta University (CU) has remained elusive for the past one-and-a-half years because the institute has failed to firm up plans for spending the money.

 While announcing the grant in the 2006-07 budget to mark the 150th anniversary of the CU the Centre had specified that the money had to be spent on research and development of related infrastructure.

 A condition for disbursal of the funds is that the research should benefit the industry and has to be carried out in association with business houses. The university was asked to send details of tie-ups with business houses.

 The university had conveyed to the Union human resources development ministry that it would like to spend the money on research in nano-technology, but there was no word on tie-ups. A nano-technology centre has already been set up in Salt Lake.

 Sources said the University Grants Commission (UGC), which will release the money, has recently written to the university, asking for details of tie-ups.

 Samir Bandyopadhyay, the CU registrar, admitted delay in receiving the funds. We have been holding talks with various industrial houses. A proposal on the tie-ups has been sent to the UGC and we hope the funds will reach us soon, he said.

 The sources said the UGC has decided to release Rs 50 crore the first instalment of the funds by March 2008 if the proposal is found satisfactory.

 A similar grant was announced for Chennai and Mumbai universities, which, too, were celebrating their 150th year. All three institutions have been denied the grant, pointed out Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of CU and a UGC member.

 The UGC follows certain procedures for releasing funds. The money for our university will be disbursed as soon as the procedure is complete, he said.

 The Centre had allotted the funds under the UGCs Mother Universities Development Project.

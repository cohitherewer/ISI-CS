 What: Launch of hair care solutions from Kaya Skin Clinic.

 Where: Kaya Skin Clinic at 7/1A Loudon Street, opposite Monapali.

 When: January 11.

 Take a look: After offering an array of skincare services, the latest from the Kaya stable is tackling tress trouble.

 Dandruff, stress-related hair thinning, age-related hair loss, post- pregnancy hair loss, inherited genetic traits, hair woes due to extreme weather conditions and pollution Kaya promises all kinds of solutions.

 The process involves a detailed session with a dermatologist who identifies the problem areas. 

 State-of-the-art equipment helps check hair diameter, density, texture and dandruff. 

 The Intensive HairRoot Therapy is a service unique to Kaya. Vital nutrients and vitamins are delivered to the root of the hair that in turn reduces hair fall and stimulates growing hair. This is followed by after-care sessions.

 Hair care products include Hair Health Gel, Anti-Dandruff Lotion and Nourishing Shampoo. While the hair gel reduces mineral deficiency, the anti-dandruff lotion not only controls dandruff, but reduces itching and scaling. The nourishing shampoo with hibiscus extracts and almond milk promises lustre to the hair and reduces hair breakage.

 Pocket pinch: Hair care products are priced Rs 225 onwards, Intensive HairRoot Therapy for 13 sessions comes for Rs 15,000 (approx).

 Voiceover: We started working on ways to address hair-related problems a couple of years ago. We wanted to come up with a holistic approach and use expertise to get to the root of the problem, says Maithili Kamat, head medical advisory, Kaya Skin Clinic.

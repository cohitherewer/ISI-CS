 Water to ease wealth worries

 - Aquarium effect

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Aquarium effect - Water is akin to 

 wealth in Feng Shui 

 and is highly favourable when used in 

 commercial areas 

 in the form of aquariums and cascading water fountains. It must be accompanied with 

 wood energy because water nourishes wood element, and when 

 wood grows, finances start soaring too

Pay problems

Q: My brother has banquet halls in Kanpur that he lets out to clients for events like birthdays, weddings and anniversary parties. Though he gets good business all through the year, his clients are not making payments over the past few years. 

The total dues in the market amount to several lakh now. The dates they give for making payments always extend to further dates and their promises are never kept. Please suggest a solution so that he gets the money soon. 

 I have gathered from your articles that if the property has a cut in the south-east corner, then cash inflow gets affected. The banquet hall has a major cut in that corner. Could this be the reason for delayed payments?

 Shanta Arora

 South-east is definitely a powerful area that is directly associated with the wealth energy of the property. Having a cut here means depriving yourself of a big chunk of wealth. 

 The best remedy would be to introduce water and wood energy here.

 Water is akin to wealth in Feng Shui and is highly favourable when used in commercial areas in the form of aquariums and cascading water fountains. 

 But please note that it must be accompanied with wood energy because water helps nourish the wood element, and when wood grows, our finances start soaring. 

 Place an aquarium with bright-coloured fish in the south-east of your banquet hall. Use green or blue coloured pebbles and shells in it rather than artificial decorations. Fresh plants in or around the aquarium will add their own chi energy that will help grow your wealth too. 

 If this is not possible, then install a cascading water fountain here with green submerged lights in it.

 Also try to give water connection to the water body from the east of the banquet hall.

 Future wise

 Q: I was born on 26.6.1989 at 10.54 am. Please let me know my lucky number, colours, directions and animal sign. I would also like to know about my studies, career and future. Please advise.

 Your birth data reveals you are an extremely strong fire person. 

 You should balanced yourself with earthy and metallic colours like beige, cream, yellow, rust and white in your immediate environment. 

 Water element in shades of blue is also important for you as this element alone has the power to control excessive fire. Keep away from greens and vibrant colours like red, maroon, purple and peach.

 Your auspicious directions in order of preference are north, south, east and south-east. 

 Your animal sign is Snake and lucky number is 4. Presently, you are going through a productive period, which will bring with it a change in your lifestyle. 

 You can take up a profession connected with metal and water. 

 Metal can be associated with computers and water is related with banking, finance, media, communication and marketing. 

 Well woes 

 Q: I am a lawyer and am practising from my own chamber in Calcutta. I built a double-storied house and in a 12-feet open passage within my boundary, I made a well in the southern corner, which is deep and is used for storing water. My house has access from the south-west and north-east. Presently, the south-west entrance is functional. I could not think of any other place for the well and the entrance. Is this construction and entrance position against Feng Shui or Vaastu? If so, then what would be the best area for the well and the entrance? Please offer me a solution for this problem because my father does not keep well and my practice has also got affected ever since this house has been constructed.

 L. Banerjee

 Having an underground water reservoir in the south is definitely against both Feng Shui and Vaastu. 

 This area is ruled by fire energy that is presently directly clashing with the water element. Seeing an open well is also not considered to be auspicious. It is best to have underground tanks for storing water in the east or north of the property. 

 Also change the entrance into the house from south-west to north-east. 

 South-west is ruled by earth energy that provides residents with great stability. Having an entrance from here means continuous movement that disturbs the stable energy of this area. It is best to keep this area quiet and tap the pious energy of the north-east to enter the house. The spiritual energy flows in and blesses the house when we step in from this direction. 

 You will soon see changes in your life after the alterations are done.

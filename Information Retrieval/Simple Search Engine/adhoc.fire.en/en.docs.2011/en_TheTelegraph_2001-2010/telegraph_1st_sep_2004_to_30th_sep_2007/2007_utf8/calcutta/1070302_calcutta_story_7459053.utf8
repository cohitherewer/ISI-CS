 Metro Briefs 

 The city and its adjoining areas experienced rain, accompanied by gusty winds, on Thursday evening, following heavy incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The Met office expects more rain in the next 24 hours and has warned of a squall with a speed of 70-80 kph. Moisture is coming in under the combined influence of a cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) over Jharkhand and a low-pressure trough in the upper air, extending from Punjab to Gangetic Bengal.

 GeNext doing their usual holiday thing at their usual hangouts in their usual turned-up denims and tees Saraswati Puja, 2007-style.

 From Forum to City Centre to CCD (Cafe Coffee Day, of course), hardly any yellow saris, and just a few kurta pyjamas, were spotted on Tuesday. The JAH (just another holiday) was all about flaunting wow westerns and Indo-westerns and just chilling.

 Gone are the days when girls would wear churidars or spin on their mummys saris. Youngsters today wear saris with daring blouses to go out elsewhere but on traditional occasions like Saraswati puja, they prefer to sport westerns. One still saw some traditional outfits in north Calcutta, but the style story in the south was more trendy than traditional, said designer Agnimitra Paul.

 For Forum raiders on Tuesday like Vidhi Desai of Class VIII, saris are just too cumbersome and behenji-like, while friend Kanishka Shah found them uncomfortable.

 If the uber cool look dominated on Saraswati puja, it was also matched by the fun feel of a winter break. Its sad that we lost a holiday, said Karan Agarwal, 18, referring to the January 23 double bill, sipping on Iced Eskimo on the steps of City Centre.

 So, an elaborate bhog was replaced by light bites, from food courts to plex counters. This Saraswati puja meant pure fun and endless adda with friends in a mall, smiled 19-year-old Arunima Sinha.

 The one tradition that has, however, braved todays trends is the touch of romance in the Vasant Panchami air. Often dubbed Valentines Day for Bengalis, Saraswati Puja continues to have a flirtatious feel. The streets on Tuesday were teeming with couples, would-be-couples and wannabe couples, smiled Sananda Sen, 20, on Elgin Road.

 And then there are the precious few who go the rang de basanti way. My cousins and I make it a point to wear the colours of the festival. So, wearing something yellow is a must today, even if we dont participate in the para puja, explained Pooja Mehta, 20, in a designer lemon salwar suit.

 Doctor beaten up by hospital officials

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two senior officials of Mission of Mercy Hospital allegedly assaulted a doctor on Friday for trying to admit a former colleague with AIDS.

 Vineet Kumar Mittal was admitted in the intensive care unit of the hospital with chest pain after being allegedly beaten up by senior administrative officers Surojit Ganguly and Shantanu Lahiri.

 Mittal was trying to admit a former Group-D employee of the hospital who was diagnosed with HIV four years ago and is now terminally ill. I have been treating him and advised him to visit Dr S.K. Guha. On Friday morning, the doctor sent him back to the hospital for blood transfusion, said Mittal. 

 He alleged that medical superintendent Jatrik Biswas refused to admit the patient and informed the administrative officers. Ganguly and Lahiri barged into my room and threatened me with dire consequences. They pushed me to the floor, abused me and beat me up. Ganguly even threatened to kill me, Mittal said in his complaint with Park Street police. 

 It is unfortunate that a doctor serving the hospital for more than 12 years has been assaulted for standing up for a colleague who was in dire need of medical attention. Nearly 150 medical and non-medical employees of the hospital have submitted a memorandum to the management and the deputy commissioner of police (south), said a doctor.

 The hospital management denied that Mittal was beaten up and alleged that he is a habitual troublemaker.

 The patient was undergoing treatment in the isolation ward last month. He was given blood and intravenous fluids and was later released as his condition improved. Biswas was personally looking after the case and had even agreed to carry out a surgery on him, said doctor Partho Bandopadhyay.

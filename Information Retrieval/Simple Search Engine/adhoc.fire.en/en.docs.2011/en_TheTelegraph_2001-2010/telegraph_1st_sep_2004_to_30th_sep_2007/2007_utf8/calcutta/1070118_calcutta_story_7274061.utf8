 Revised rules for college entry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state higher education council on Wednesday directed universities to start revising their guidelines for undergraduate admission in view of the introduction of grades in Higher Secondary from this year. 

 The council issued the directive at a meeting attended by vice-chancellors and pro vice-chancellors of Calcutta, Jadavpur, Rabindra Bharati and other universities. 

 The universities have been asked to formulate guidelines according to their requirement, taking into consideration the changed circumstances, said vice-chairman of the council Subimal Sen.

 We will meet the university authorities again after a month to finalise the procedures the universities and colleges will have to follow while admitting students in the BA, B.Sc and B.Com courses from the current year, added Sen.

 There is confusion over the admission procedure in undergraduate courses following the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Educations decision to replace the practice of awarding marks and divisions with grades from 2007.

 The finalising of admission criteria has become problematic under the changed system, as there will be no mention of marks on the students results from Higher Secondary 2007.

 The university representatives at Wednesdays meeting observed that the marks obtained by students in the best of five subjects can be taken into consideration for admissions. The five subjects could include first language, second language and the three elective subjects. 

 Till last year, colleges could fix the admission criteria on the basis of the division and the marks obtained by students in individual subjects. 

 We will examine the matter thoroughly before finalising the revised admission procedure, said pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of Calcutta University Suranjan Das after the meeting.

 According to him, the 170-plus colleges affiliated to the university will be able to fix their admission criteria on the basis of their seat strength. But the colleges will have to follow our guidelines in determining the cut-off percentages for courses, emphasised Das.

 Several factors need to be examined before finalising the guidelines, he added.

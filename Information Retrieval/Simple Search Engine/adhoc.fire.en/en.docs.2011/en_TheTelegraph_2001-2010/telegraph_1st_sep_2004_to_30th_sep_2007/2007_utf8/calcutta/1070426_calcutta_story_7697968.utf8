The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Snag leads to blackout

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Large areas of south Calcutta went without electricity for nearly 11 hours, following a fault in the CESCs high-tension feeder line on Bondel Road, in the New Ballygunge area, early on Wednesday.

 Sources said the snag occurred around 3 am. The line was restored at 1.45 pm. 

 The power blackout led to severe water scarcity in Kasba, Haltu, Bondel Road and other areas in New Ballygunge. 

 While detecting the fault, three CESC employees were injured. Srinjoy Bagchi, S. Bhagat and Sujit Bag suffered burns and were taken to Ruby General Hospital. Bagchi was released after first-aid.

 The city on Wednesday also recorded the highest demand for power this year. A CESC official said during the evening peak hours, the demand touched 1,360 MW.

 The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company, the newly-formed state power distribution firm, supplied 450 MW to the CESC grid, helping the power utility cope with the high demand.

 The demand in the state grid was less, following a Norwester and rain in some of the districts, a power department official said.

 The weather office predicted the possibility of a thundershower and a Norwester in the next 24 hours. 

 Wednesdays maximum temperature was 35.6 degrees Celsius, which is normal. 

 There is a cyclonic circulation over Gangetic Bengal, which is helping to suck in moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal. The moisture is leading to the development of thunderclouds. We are expecting rain and some thundershowers on Thursday in the city and its fringes, a Met official said.

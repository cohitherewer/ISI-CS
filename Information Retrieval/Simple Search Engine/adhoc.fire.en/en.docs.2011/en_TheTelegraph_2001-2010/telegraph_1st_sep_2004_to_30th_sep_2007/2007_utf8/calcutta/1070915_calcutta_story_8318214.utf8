 A division bench of Calcutta High Court observed on Friday that morning-walkers should not be allowed within the Victoria Memorial Hall complex, citing environmental concerns.

 The bench, comprising Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice R.N. Banerjee, said during the hearing of a case on pollution at the Memorial: The monument authorities should not allow morning-walkers on the premises.

 The observation followed a report by a 13-member committee of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, which said: The morning mist lessens the pollution around the Memorial and also helps improve the condition of the marble.

 Following an earlier directive of the court, petitioner Subhas Dutta submitted a list of fees collected from visitors to various museums and monuments in the country. Taj Mahal charges an entry fee of Rs 20, while the fees at the museums in Delhi and Calcutta and Red Fort are Rs 10. The entry fee at the Ajanta Caves is Rs 50. Morning-walkers are not allowed at any of these places.

 On being asked why morning-walkers are allowed on the Memorial premises, A. Mitra, who appeared for the monument authorities, said: This has been a tradition.

 Dutta said: Many Calcuttans will be upset if the morning constitutional is banned on the compound. The courts observation is in the best interests of the city, though the question of public health is equally important. Like Mumbai and Chennai, he added, morning-walkers should be allowed inside the race course, without any fees.

 Mitra, however, informed the court that many of the morning-walkers have now started using the adjacent parks instead of the Memorial compound. 

 A fortnight ago, the bench had expressed a desire to raise the monthly entry fee of the morning-walkers from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000. A petition on behalf of the morning-walkers pleaded with the court to reconsider its view and also sought permission to park cars outside the compound.

 The court will pass its verdict on September 21. We will deliver a final judgment and dispose of the matter on that day, said Justice Bhattacharya.

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Water is the ruling element of the career area, which is the northern sector of the house. Hence, energising this area with pictures of flowing rivers or waterfalls brings success in your professional life. Placing a fountain in the north of the house or the garden helps attract unexpected opportunities.

An intact northern sector is considered to be good for successful career and business. If this area happens to be missing from the house, it becomes very difficult to find a job that is lucrative and satisfying. People even find it difficult to cultivate willpower and ambition so essential for career growth and personal development. If the area is extended, career opportunities flow in.

Hence there is always a need to energise the northern sector keeping in mind the principles of Feng Shui.

Clear clutter

There is a subtle connection between the northern area of the house and the magnetic north of the earth. We all know that the magnetic north is characterised by cold and darkness. Due to the absence of solar energy here, it is essential to ensure further blockages of energy are done away with. Hence removal of clutter should be the primary focus as it will result in good health and bring career success.

Water wonder

The walls in the northern area should have pictures of flowing rivers or waterfalls. However, pictures of still lakes, ponds and stagnant water bodies should be avoided as they may lead to stagnation in career opportunities. A novel way to energise the area would be to place a crystal light with a blue bulb. 

 If the entrance to your house happens to be in the north, hang a hollow wind chime with six or seven rods as it helps to raise the Chi energy and in turn enhances your chance of promotions. If nothing seems to be working right in your professional life, try placing a water fountain in the northern sector of the house or garden as this will help attract unexpected opportunities. 

 However, care should be taken to ensure that the placement is such that the water is pouring into the house rather than out of the house. 

 If a fountain is kept high, the water could drown instead of uplift you. Hence, it is advisable to keep it at a lower height. Care must also be taken to ensure that there is no obstruction in front of the fountain as water should flow freely into the house.

 Water is the ruling element of the career area. Placing a painting or poster of a sailing ship loaded with merchandise is symbolic of bringing home gold and prosperity. However, make sure the ship is not on a stormy sea. A model of a ship, sailing towards the house, can be placed on a console or coffee table in a plate of water. If the ship faces outwards, it means that your wealth is being carried away.

 Mirror mantra

 The use of mirrors would be very helpful in expanding this area and drawing more energy towards them. One may use rich metallic frames for the mirrors because this area is governed by water, which in turn is nourished by metal according to the production cycle. An empty metallic bowl or vase may be kept next to it as it symbolises new beginnings in life.

 Animal effect

 The Chinese believe that a picture or an aquarium with eight gold fish and one black fish in the living room brings luck and prosperity. The number nine represents completeness from heaven to earth. The black fish is supposed to absorb negativity and the gold fish are said to bring in wealth. 

 An elephant may be placed in this area to nourish the sector with power and energy. There is a common belief that if you place whatever you want on the back of the elephant your wish will come true. 

 Place a bowl of water with six or seven coins in it, on the back of a metallic elephant in the north of your living room and see your career grow.

 Tip of the week

 Place a pendulum or a revolving clock on the north wall of the living area so that the career energy is constantly stimulated.

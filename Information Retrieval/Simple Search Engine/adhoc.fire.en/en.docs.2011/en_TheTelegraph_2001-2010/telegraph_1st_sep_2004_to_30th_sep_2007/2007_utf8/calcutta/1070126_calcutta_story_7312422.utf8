The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Five years, 200 places, Rs 100 crore...

 Screen On amp; off 

 It is being touted as one of the most expensive programmes to hit Indian television. Produced at a budget of Rs 100 crore-plus, Discovery Channels Planet Earth took five years to make, going around 200 locations in the world. It is hitting the Indian screens on February 1, earlier than the channels hometurf the US.

 The earth may have a population of more than six billion people but there are so many places barely touched by humanity. This programme travels to such areas to capture incredible footage of how rarely-spotted inhabitants adapt to the extreme weather conditions, explains Rajiv Bakshi, associate director, marketing and communications, Discovery Networks, on a days tour of Calcutta.

 People know about migration of birds but how many know that animals migrate? he asks. In north Canadas wilderness, about three million caribou migrate across the Arctic Tundra, covering as much as 2,000 miles a year in search of fresh pastures, the longest overland migration by animals. Migration happens in the deep, too, as the great white sharks swim across oceans.

 The series starts with a look at the poles. Winter in Antarctica brings four months of darkness with temperatures dropping to minus 70 degree Celsius. Amid such extremities, the camera captures a polar bear walking into hibernation. And four months later, walking out, babies in tow. The crew had to wait for that magic moment in conditions that force even a polar bear to withdraw, Bakshi points out.

 If there is drama, there is humour and romance as well, cropping up though the series. The male Emperor Penguins (picture left) queue up to impress the female. They are a heroic lot. When all animals run away during winter from Antarctica, they are the ones who stay back to preserve their species.

 Narrated by natural historian Sir David Attenborough, Planet Earth, to air every Thursday at 8 pm, is possibly the first natural history series to be filmed entirely in high definition. Computer-generated graphics have been used sparingly, and to breathtaking effect, to take viewers where a camera cannot venture down an erupting volcano or deep inside the earth.

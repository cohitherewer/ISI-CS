 Upgrade package for Howrah

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government on Wednesday finalised a Rs 247-crore package for the development of Howrah town and its vicinity.

 The package, approved under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, aims at revamping the drainage, traffic and the water supply systems of these areas. Slum development, too, figures prominently on the list.

 The development scheme was finalised at a meeting called by urban development minister Asok Bhattacharyya at Writers Buildings on Wednesday. The Howrah mayor, Gopal Mukherjee, and other members of the municipal corporation attended the meeting.

 Representatives of Howrah Improvement Trust (HIT), railways and neighbouring municipalities were also present.

 The package that we have finalised will cover all aspects of development of Howrah and its surrounding areas. But special emphasis has been given on drainage, considering the recent spate of waterlogging, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharyya.

 The drainage and sewerage schemes will cost Rs 93 crore.

 The minister pointed out that the problem of waterlogging can be solved only if channels are dug to link the drains. Dredging of the Pancha canal is also a priority.

 A team comprising officials of the civic body, HIT and the railways will inspect Tikiapara, where the tracks remained inundated for three days following the July 3 downpour. Drainage revamp work will start once the committee submits its report.

 Around Rs 90 crore has been allotted for the improvement of the water supply system. Kanika Ganguly, the MLA from Bali, has submitted a Rs 50-lakh proposal, which includes construction of an underground reservoir and 16 overhead reservoirs.

 We aim to supply treated surface water from the Padmapukur water treatment plant to the people of Howrah and added areas, the minister said.

 For slum development, the package has allotted around Rs 64 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rs 1,000 a month for morning walk

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Victoria Memorial

 Calcutta High Court has suggested that morning-walkers in the Victoria Memorial Hall compound pay Rs 1,000 per month as entry fee. At present, the walkers pay a monthly fee of Rs 100.

 It could be Rs 500 for senior citizens, a division bench, headed by Justice B. Bhattacharya, said on Friday, while hearing a case on pollution in the Memorial area.

 According to the bench, the people using the Memorial compound are rich enough. 

 Most of the walkers arrive at the Memorial by car. I am sure they can afford the fee, Bhattacharya observed. The Memorial authorities, too, expressed similar views. 

 We have no objection if the court revises the entry fee, said Anindya Mitra, appearing for the Memorial authorities.

 The high court also asked police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee to deploy officers to collect a fine of Rs 100 from visitors found littering the Memorial complex.

 The amount will be spent on the upkeep of the Memorial and its surroundings, the court observed. 

 Environment activist and petitioner in the case Subhas Dutta said that the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) in its report placed before the high court had recommended removal of bus stands from Esplanade to keep the monument area pollution-free. The ruling in the case is scheduled for August 31.

 The Memorial authorities also filed an affidavit stating that 1,800 trees were planted around the complex, following Neeris recommendations.

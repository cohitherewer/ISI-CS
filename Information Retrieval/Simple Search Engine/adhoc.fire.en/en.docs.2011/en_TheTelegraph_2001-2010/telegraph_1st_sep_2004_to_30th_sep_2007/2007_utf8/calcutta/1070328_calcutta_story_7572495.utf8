 Green drive: Apropos

 the report For palms and all things green, February 28, the proposed measure

 by the civic body, if implemented, will completely change the look of the

 city roads. Full-grown palm trees will look wonderful as road dividers.

 The city needs as much green cover as possible. Moreover, iron railings

 and other structures used as dividers are regularly stolen. 

 The picture of the Hooghly bank (Filthy flows the

 Hooghly, February 27) came as a reminder of how miserably the government

 has failed to protect the river from pollution. 

 It is amazing that the authorities have spent Rs 400 crore under the Ganga Action Plan with almost no effect on the rivers pollution level. The government needs to explain to the public why it allows jute mills along the Hooghly to dump garbage into the river. Perhaps, slackness on part of the government employees in discharging their duties is all there is to the matter. 

 International agencies have repeatedly warned about the rising pollution level of the river without prompting effective measures from the authorities. Scientists, too, have time and again explained that environmental degradation is responsible for global warming. Yet, the government cannot be shaken out of its apathy. 

 Words are not enough. Sincere and vigorous effort is required for positive results. The government should remember that it is its duty to save the environment from pollution. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report Morgue rats on nibble spree, February 22, it is most unfortunate that Visham Rays body was nibbled by rats in the Sambhunath Pandit Hospital morgue. In November 2005, at the same hospital, ants had nibbled an eye of a patient. How could the hospital management allow a repeat of the dreadful incident? A probe should be conducted immediately and the hospital superintendent should step down if he is found guilty. State health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, too, cannot shrug off responsibility. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur. 

 Rats nibbling a patients body at Sambhunath Pandit

 Hospital betrays the callousness of the authorities. There are no words to

 condemn the incident since it is the second such happening at the hospital.

 The less said about the deplorable condition of state-run hospitals the better.

 Such incidents tarnish the image of Bengal. How long will the authorities

 remain silent spectators to the plight of the common people who cannot afford

 private healthcare services? 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road. 

 Apropos the report Probe into death, February 23, an era has come to an end with the death of distinguished film-maker Anjan Chowdhury. I am shocked that his family members have lodged a complaint of negligence. If a person like Chowdhury can die due to negligence by doctors, then one can only imagine the plight of the common people. The government needs to revamp its healthcare delivery system. 

 Atif Ayaz, 

 Serampore. 

 Apropos the report Killer blow, cruel bill, February 24, overcharging by nursing homes, with the state government watching helplessly, has become a routine affair. Diagnostic centres and private clinics without even the basic facilities have sprung up in all localities. One fails to understand how these establishments manage to procure licences. The healthcare system in the state is in doldrums with animals having a free run of the wards, while nursing homes and clinical laboratories are being run with the sole intention of squeezing out the maximum profit from patients. The chief minister must intervene to sort out the mess. 

 A.S. Mehta,

 New Alipore. 

 Doctors and nursing home authorities seem to

 have lost their humanity. Otherwise, how could the authorities of a nursing

 home insist on a hefty deposit to perform a surgery on a dying patient.

 The exorbitant bill that the nursing home handed to the patients family

 after his death points to lack of monitoring mechanism. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Beleghata.

 Apropos the report CCTV cameras in Sector V, February 23, the decision to instal closed-circuit cameras in the tech hub is important and timely. Criminal activity is on the rise in the township. Petty crimes like thefts and eveteasing have become quite common. Rash driving, which leads to accidents, is another problem. The condition is so grave that the administration should think of installing closed-circuit cameras in the entire township. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report Break-in at Shiva temple, February 28, it is sad that immoral and greedy people wont even stop at robbing gold and silver from the gods. The same days edition reported a suicide by a 22-year-old housewife (Dowry death) after being tortured for dowry. It is yet another example of greed getting the better of the human qualities. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos the report Commemoration, February 22, the rodent population at Curzon Park are indeed popular. While most people try to kill rats at home, at the park the pests are offered food! 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia.

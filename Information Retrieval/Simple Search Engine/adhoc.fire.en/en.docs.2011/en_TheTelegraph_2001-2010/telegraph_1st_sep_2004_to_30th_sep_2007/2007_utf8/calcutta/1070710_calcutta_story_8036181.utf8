 A 200-strong mob stormed Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital and gheraoed the superintendent on Monday morning, demanding immediate opening of a burns unit.

 The protesters said the unit had been set up with funds allotted by Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, under the MP local area development scheme, in 2001.

 Its lying closed because of the negligence of the authorities, said a protester.

 A hospital official admitted that the money had been spent on setting up the necessary infrastructure, but shortage of staff is holding back the commissioning of the unit.

 There are enough doctors, but we need 20 more hands in the nursing, security and other departments, he added. A part of the Jibanananda Das block has been earmarked for the unit.

 Tarun Kanti Manna, the superintendent who was kept gheraoed for an hour before being rescued by police, said a six-bed burns ward will be opened soon. We will first open a six-bed indoor ward by the end of this month or by next month.

 Reacting to the superintendents announcement, a protester said: We will wait for a month. If the ward is not ready by then, we will launch a bigger movement.

 The protesters, including a few Trinamul supporters, also handed over a memorandum to the superintendent, demanding immediate opening of the unit.

 The hospital caters to thousands of people living in the Bhowanipore, Kidderpore, Chetla, Tollygunge and Ballygunge areas. A burns unit is a must. We fail to understand why it is not being opened, said Malay Sarkar, a local resident who joined the protest.

 He said his father had died of burns a few years ago. Had there been a burns unit at Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital, he would have survived, he said.

 Apart from helping thousands of patients, the unit could have taken some load off SSKM Hospital, said Subrata Bakshi, the Trinamul MLA from Chowringhee.

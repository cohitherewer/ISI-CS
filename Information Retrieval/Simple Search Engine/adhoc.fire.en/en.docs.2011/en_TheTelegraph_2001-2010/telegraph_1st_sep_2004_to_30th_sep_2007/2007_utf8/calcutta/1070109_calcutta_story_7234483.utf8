 Varsities on retest route

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur and Calcutta universities will make special arrangements for those who could not appear for the exams scheduled for Monday because of the sudden bandh.

 Sources in both universities said the attendance in the exams was close to normal.

 We can make some arrangements for the absentee examinees if we find they were really unable to sit for the test because of the bandh, said Rajat Bandyopadhyay, registrar, Jadavpur University.

 We will take some measures if the students inform us in writing that they were affected by the bandh, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic), Calcutta University.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Delhi nod for East-West

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The East-West Metro project has cleared another hurdle, with the Planning Commission showing the project the green light on Monday.

 The Planning Commission cleared the project after a meeting with us. A written approval will be faxed to us by Friday, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and Chowdhury attended the meeting in Delhi. They explained the details of the project to Commission officials, including member-secretary Rajiv Ratan Shah.

 The Centres approval means that it has agreed to shell out its 22.5 per cent share of the project, which works out to Rs 1,100 crore. It also means that the project only needs a formal nod from the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) for start of work.

 A JBIC team will arrive on a final appraisal mission to the city on October 29.

 They wanted to know why we were seeking a loan instead of going for a public-private partnership (PPP). We explained that the JBIC is offering us a 30-year loan at two per cent interest. Theyve allowed a construction period of six years, following a 10-year moratorium, which means that the government doesnt have to repay any money before 2024, explained a senior transport department official. 

 In its presentation, the government also stated that most of the successful Metro rail projects globally are owned and operated through special purpose vehicles and not through PPPs.

 The government also argued that in a PPP project, high fares would have to be charged initially to service the debt.

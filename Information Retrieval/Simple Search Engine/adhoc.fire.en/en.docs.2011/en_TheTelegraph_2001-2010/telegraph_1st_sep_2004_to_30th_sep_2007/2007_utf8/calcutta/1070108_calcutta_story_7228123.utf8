 Wounds of people divided

 Stories of violence, of trauma, of crossing borders, of famine, questions of identity, stories of humanism there is no dearth of material to make gripping narratives on the partition of Bengal.

 And this is best exemplified in Bengal Partition Stories, An Unclosed Chapter, an edited volume of 39 translated stories by 31 Bengali authors starting inevitably with Tagore and including Annadashankar Ray, Manik Bandopadhyay, Narayan Gangopadhyay, Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, Syyed Mustafa Siraj, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Dibyendu Palit and Imdadul Haq Milan.

 At the launch of the volume on Friday evening at the British Council, the mood was both sombre and charged. Practically everyone present was touched by Partition, a disaster that affected nearly every home, in East Bengal or West.

 Writer-editor Bashabi Fraser raised pointed and poignant questions of partitioning people, their homes, their land, language, customs, rituals... Was it possible really? she asked, as she recounted figures: about 2,000 miles of a new territorial border; an exodus of 10-12 million; an estimated million, including 75,000 women, who never reached their destination... 

 Singer-lyricist Moushumi Bhoumiks rendition of Banglar Mati, Banglar Jal underlined these stories and figures.

 The book reopens the wounds to examine them afresh and the editors introduction places the stories in perspective. While much has been written on the western border, there is near silence around Bengal Partition.

 It was, in fact, historian Mushirul Hasans India Partitioned, The Other Face of Partition that prompted Bashabis current endeavour. When Hasan was confronted with the question why he never wrote on the Bengal Partition, he reportedly said: But there was no violence on a mass scale like in Punjab. 

 It was this misconception that Fraser sought to dispel. While there might not have been ghost trains as between Lahore and Amritsar carrying mutilated bodies, violence was no less here, countered Fraser. Partition of Bengal had not been explained as I wanted it.

 And the hardship and challenges of Partition continue, says Fraser, pointing to the rise of agitational politics in the refugee colonies when communist parties organised their mass base there.

 You are known to be one of the top motivational speakers 

 of the world. Who or what has motivated you the most?

 Although people frequently refer 

 to me as a motivational speaker, I am not a motivational 

 speaker. I try my best to comment on the correlation between 

 science and spirituality. My inspiration comes to me from 

 periods of inner silence.

 Creating health takes a front 

 seat in all your teachings. What would your five lifestyle 

 mantras for todays generation be?

 Take it easy.

 Dont eat anything that comes in a can or has a label.

 Sleep well everyday.

 Exercise every day.

 Meditate every day.

 The West has re-discovered Ayurveda 

 and yoga in recent years. What is your advice to young India?

 Young India must go through its own trials and tribulations and its own learning process before it re-embraces its own wisdom.

 What is the greatest lesson life 

 has taught you?

 Be independent of the good and bad opinions of others. What others say about me is none of my business. What I say about me is also none of my business!

 What is therapeutic to your soul?

 Silence.

 The new-age guru signing his book 

 in New York 

 Which, according to you, is the 

 most underrated virtue and the most overrated vice? 

 The most underrated virtue is 

 humility; and the most overrated vice is sex.

 Your association with Shekhar 

 Kapur goes back a long way. What is your take on mainstream 

 Bollywood? Do you like watching Hindi movies? 

 Im not familiar enough with mainstream Bollywood to comment on it. I have not watched a Hindi movie for a while. 

 Who are the film personalities 

 you are in touch with? 

 Not anyone on a regular basis 

 except for Shekhar. And these days Nicholas Cage, since 

 I am writing a script for his latest movie, Sadhu. 

 Also, on occasion, Mike Meyers the comedian.

 Have you got anything specific 

 planned for your Calcutta talk? What is your general impression 

 of our city?

 Calcutta has a soul, so I guess 

 I will talk about the soul. 

 Have you been closely associated 

 with anyone from Bengal? 

 At the soul level, with Rabindranath Tagore.

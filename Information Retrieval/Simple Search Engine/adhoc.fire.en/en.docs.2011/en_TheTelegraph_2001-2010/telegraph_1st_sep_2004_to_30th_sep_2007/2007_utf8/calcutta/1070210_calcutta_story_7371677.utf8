The 10-day visit to Calcutta, from January 15 to 25, was an eye-opener for Sangeetanshuman and his friends from 10 schools all over North and East India. During the run-up to Funrise 2007, a sports festival for 90 primary-section students of The Heritage School, the children discovered their hidden talents and gained the confidence to take up challenges. The festival, held on January 24, was a project of Dreams and Teams that required the 20 students, two each from 10 schools, to single-handedly organise the event. The initiative was a first in India by British Council in partnership with the Youth Sport Trust, a charitable foundation in the UK.

 The first phase of the project involved a two-day training for the teachers, one from each school, by Karen Arnold of Dreams and Teams, UK. The teachers, christened trainers, in turn honed the students skills.

 Explained Arnold who has been involved with Dreams and Teams for the past six years: Despite cultural differences, young people around the world are similar in their desire for a better world. The kids here are as eager as those everywhere else to experiment with new ideas.

 Sangeetanshuman, a student of Stuart School, Cuttack, was in-charge of public relations for the festival. He was trained, along with the other kids, in the management of space, task, equipment, people and success.

 The training sessions yielded good results. The students managed to lead 90 kids through a sit-and-draw contest and games like football, handball and relay races, played with modified rules. Explained Kaushik Barua of Faculty Higher Secondary School, Guwahati: For instance, you could score a goal only if you had passed a ball four times. 

 The students also learned how to put up a good show within a shoe-string budget. Said Niyati Jhaveria of Banyan Tree School, New Delhi, who put up a dance performance: The budget, only Rs 2,000 was shocking, as was the knowledge that we were to manage 90 children. I had 15 minutes to download the songs and organise the dance. At the end of the festival, it was a merry bunch that sang along to Knocking on heavens door and Jiski biwi moti to the twanging of guitar strings.

 Kaushik summed up the dominant mood before the event wrapped up: Ten days ago, we didnt know each other at all. Yet having lived and worked side for the past few days, it will be painful to go our own ways.

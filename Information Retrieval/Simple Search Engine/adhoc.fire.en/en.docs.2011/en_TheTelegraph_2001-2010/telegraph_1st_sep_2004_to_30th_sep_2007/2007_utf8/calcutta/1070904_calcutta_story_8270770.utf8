 A British firm, which acts as a consultant of the Thames Water Authority, will guide the city civic body in implementing its drainage revamp scheme.

 The Rs 400-crore project, which is scheduled to start in November, is being taken up under Jawharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

 Sources in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said the mayoral council members unanimously decided to appoint London-based Werm amp; Wink as consultant for the project till 2010.

 Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharaya has endorsed the decision to appoint the firm, which had quoted the lowest price in the bidding.

 The second lowest price, quoted by a German firm, was 50 per cent more than Werm amp; Winks figure. The British consultant has also agreed to offer five per cent discount on pre-tax rate ??? for its service.

 Civic principal chief engineer (project amp; development) Nilangshu Bose said Werm amp; Wink is a civil engineering firm which has worked throughout the UK for water, sewerage and land drainage infrastructure development.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had held a meeting with the British deputy high commissioner in Calcutta, Kevin McCole, to ensure Werm amp; Winks participation in the bidding.

 Werm amp; Wink will introduce the trenchless tenhique in the city to desilt and refurbish the century-old brick sewers running under main thoroughfares in the citys core area.

 The technique will cause minimum traffic disruption, as it does not involve excavation of the roads.

 The sewers are two-third full with silt. Once the silt is taken out, waterlogging will be considerably reduced in the core area, said an official.

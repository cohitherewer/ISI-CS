 Varsity plan to promote reading

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta University has taken up a programme to boost the reading habit and skills of students.

 From making students and young people aware of the benefits of reading to teaching them how to read better, the programme, the first such by the university, will include a variety of activities.

 Seminars and workshops will be organised in schools and colleges to provide tips to teachers and parents on how to motivate students to read more. Schools will be encouraged to set reading targets for students and reward those who meet the targets. 

 Reading must be a priority for students and young people. Our aim is to create confident readers, said Soumendra Nath Bera, the director of the universitys Centre for Studies in Book Publishing (CSBP), which was set up in August. The centre will implement the project. 

 A unique aspect of the programme, according to Bera, is that along with promoting reading, it will encourage students and youths to be more computer savvy. We will explain to students why they should be technologically aware. At the same time, they should spend more time reading books at home, said Bera.

 A study on the decline in reading habit among students has prompted the university to undertake the programme. The study does not show that students are reading less because they are spending more time on the Net. There are many other factors like syllabus load and competition, said a university official.

 Representatives of the CSBP will visit schools and colleges and deliver lectures on various aspects of books. The topics will vary from history of reading to the latest methods of book preservation, added the official.

 The university has already contacted publishers like the National Book Trust and Oxford University Press for organising joint seminars and workshops in schools, colleges and various localities.

 The programme will provide detailed information to students about availability of books. We are preparing brochures with details of libraries in the city and the books they house. There will be special mention of rare books, said the official.

 The project, however, will not be the primary focus of CSBP. According to another official, the main function of the centre will be to promote excellence in all aspects of book publishing. The centre will also offer postgraduate courses in book publishing, organise short training programmes for publishing professionals and create a resource centre on book publishing.

 The centre will be funded by the university and the state government. A significant part of the money will come from the fees paid by the students.

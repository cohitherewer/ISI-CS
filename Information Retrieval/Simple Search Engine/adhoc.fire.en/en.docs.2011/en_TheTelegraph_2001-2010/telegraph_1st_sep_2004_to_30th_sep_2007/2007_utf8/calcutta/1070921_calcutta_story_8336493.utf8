 Myth and magic

 Mon Art Gallerie, in association with Kynkyny Art Gallery, Bangalore, presents the recent works of Basuki Dasgupta and G.Subramanian. The works of both artists have the common binding factor of a strong influence of native or folk art. Myths have been part of the Indian cultural milieu and are to be found in our presentday coffee table conversations, literature, television and film imagery. Born in the polyvalent culture of multiple worlds, both these artists adopt the global with local sensibility in a fluid aesthetic; the folk, the popular and the classical coexist in magical harmony. While Dasguptas works can be seen as his tribute to the decorative found in folk and his obsession with the romantic, Subramanians collages show man caught in the flux of maya and his works throb with the sap of life or rasa. A work by him, titled Girls in Festive Mood, appears here.

 Event: An exhibition of art works by Basuki Dasgupta and G. Subramanian When: Till September 23; 11.30 am - 7 pm Where: Mon Art Gallerie, Hungerford Street

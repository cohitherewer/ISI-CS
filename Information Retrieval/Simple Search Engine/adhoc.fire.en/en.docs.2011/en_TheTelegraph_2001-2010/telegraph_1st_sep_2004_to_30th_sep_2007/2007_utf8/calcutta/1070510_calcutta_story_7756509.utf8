 State eyes defence land in Sector V

 Salt Lake Sector V: Full up. A Telegraph picture

 The West Bengal government is working overtime to lay its hands on a prime 60-acre plot in the Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec). 

 With companies queuing up at Writers Buildings seeking land, the government has requested the owners the defence ministry to release the prime plot in Sector V. 

 As price of land in Rajarhat has shot through the roof and the area near Vedic Village identified as the next IT hub is yet to be developed, the state government is banking big time on the prime plot opposite Wipros campus. 

 The chief minister wrote a letter to Union defence minister A.K. Antony last month to release the land, said chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb. 

 Sector V is spread over 300 acres, but land is no longer available. Though bigger companies like Infosys and ITC Infotech need 50-acre-plus plots, smaller outfits can be accommodated on the defence land. 

 We have no vacant space left in Saltlec, so it will be a bonus, said a senior IT industry official. 

 The proposal to the defence ministry for the plot in Salt Lake was initiated last year when Pranab Mukherjee was defence minister. But Mukherjee could not grant permission because of the rules followed by the defence cantonments establishment (the superviser and custodian of all defence real estate).

 A highly-placed source in the defence establishment told Metro the rule requires that the state government give an equal amount of land (if it is of the same quality) or more (if it is of poorer quality) in exchange of the original land. 

 As the plot the state government should offer is linked to its location, the government has zeroed in on a large chunk. 

 We have identified an alternative location of around 300 to 350 acres in Budge Budge and have also shown it to the local army authorities. But we are yet to get any feedback, said Deb. 

 With the state government taking the necessary steps, the IT industry insiders are hopeful that the 60-acre plot will be released soon.

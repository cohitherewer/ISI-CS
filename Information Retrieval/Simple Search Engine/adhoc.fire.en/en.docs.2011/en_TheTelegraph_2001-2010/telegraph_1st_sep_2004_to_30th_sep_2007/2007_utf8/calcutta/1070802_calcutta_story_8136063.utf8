Four men shot dead one of the most wanted criminals of Hooghly and a 17-year-old boy at Dasnagar, in Howrah, on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The gang crossed the railway tracks and walked to Melatala around 1pm. Kajal Banik, 28, was standing near a carpenters shop, watching some local boys fly kites.

 The men shot Banik twice and then Santosh Sahu, the teenager, once. The four then hurled two crude bombs before fleeing.

 Santosh was taken to Howrah district hospital, where he died. Bapan Mal, 17, one of the boys flying a kite, was hit by a splinter. He was admitted in a local nursing home.

 Banik was wanted in several cases of murder, dacoity and extortion in Hooghly. In Uttarpara police station alone, 19 cases six of them relating to murder were lodged against him. 

 Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh said: We have sought help from Hooghly police. Teenager Santosh does not have a criminal record. We are trying to find out if he had any link with Banik. We will ask Bapan to give a description of the criminals.

 The investigating officers said Banik had been staying in a rented room in the area for four months. The two sons of his landlord, Ajit Goswami, have been detained.

 Local residents said Santosh was an amiable boy. He worked in a factory in Kadamtala to support his family. His father, Ramchandra Sahu, a retired worker of Bharat Jute Mill, is old and infirm. His mother Bibha works as a help.

 Manju Mukhopadhyay, a resident of Melapara, said: I have no clue why they killed Santosh. Leave alone crime, he had never misbehaved with anyone from the locality. I came out hearing the sound of the bombs and saw the men walking towards the rail tracks. I did not raise an alarm for the fear of getting shot.

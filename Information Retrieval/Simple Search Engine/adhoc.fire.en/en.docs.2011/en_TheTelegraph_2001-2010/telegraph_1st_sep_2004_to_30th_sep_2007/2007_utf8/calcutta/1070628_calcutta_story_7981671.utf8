The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Campaign for Taj

 - Global vote for seven new wonders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Everybody knows it, everybody loves it and over the next 11 days Calcuttans will play a key role in affirming the status that the Taj Mahal claims.

 On July 7 in Lisbon, Portugal, the new seven wonders of the world, as chosen by people from across the globe, will be revealed by www.new7wonders.com, which has set up the international vote.

 The leader of the campaign for the Taj Mahal has come to Calcutta to drum up support. Bharat Kapadia, chairman of India Unites For The Taj Movement, said: Calcutta is obviously a major source of support for the campaign and we need all the votes we can get from here.

 Kapadia was surprised and shocked by the lack of awareness in India about the competition. There have been few voters because people didnt know about the competition. We decided to set up the India Unites For The Taj Movement to make sure that the Taj not only becomes one of the new wonders of the world but also that it is the most voted for.

 What are the benefits for India if the Taj becomes a new wonder of the world? Kapadia felt: In the age of Internet, we need good publicity on the world wide web. By becoming one the seven wonders, Taj will get enormous publicity, which will bring in billions of dollars of tourism money. According to him, It would be a national shame if the Taj doesnt make it in.

 Other major nominees include the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty and the Great Wall of China. Any structure built or discovered before 2000 is eligible for selection.

 Campaigning for the Taj has not been easy. Although the government provided verbal support, it did not provide funds for, which is a shame. Every other government has donated generously.

 A television advertisement has been made in support of the cause. An Anthem by A.R. Rahman was commissioned (along with a video) for the promotion of the project.

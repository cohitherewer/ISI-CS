 Murder cry in Behala

 A STAFF REPORTER

Mystery shrouds the death of 28-year-old Rabi Saha (in picture), a building material supplier and autorickshaw owner, in Behala on Thursday night. His family claims Rabi was murdered, but police say it was an accident. However, one person has been arrested in connection with the death.

 On Thursday night, residents of James Long Sarani heard an auto screech to a halt near a pile of bricks. When they drew closer to the vehicle, they saw a youth inside, bleeding profusely. He was taken to Vidyasagar Hospital, where he was declared dead.

 Ratna, Rabis sister-in-law, said he went out around noon on Thursday with a stranger. I was surprised, because he left home without telling us where he was going. Around 11.30 pm, we came to know that he had died in hospital.

 Rabis elder sister Sabita said: There were deep wounds on his head. It seems he was shot from close range. 

 District superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta said both Rabi and friend Ashim Seal were drunk. We have arrested Ashim for rash driving. Rabi died as the auto hit the bricks stacked on the road. We have sent the body for post-mortem.

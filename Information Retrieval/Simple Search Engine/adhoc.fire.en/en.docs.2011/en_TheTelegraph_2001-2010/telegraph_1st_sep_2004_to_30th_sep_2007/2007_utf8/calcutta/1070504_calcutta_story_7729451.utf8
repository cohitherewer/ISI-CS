 Loss-makers to cash cows

 - Owners flock to pay and legalise market stalls

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The dead assets have suddenly become cash cows for the civic body. 

 With the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) deciding to renovate the 23-odd civic markets across the city by joining hands with private players, the once loss-making markets have started filling up its coffers. 

 While companies like Reliance are shelling out huge sums of money for the markets, the vendors are queuing up at the CMC headquarters to legalise their stalls in these markets.

 In the past four months, the civic body has earned over Rs 20 crore from the vendors as stallage charge, or the one-time fee that a new owner needs to pay the civic body for changing the name of the stall-owner. 

 In the civic markets, at least 60 per cent of the stalls have long been transferred to third parties without the knowledge of the CMC. 

 These old markets will be demolished and new markets will come up But for rehabilitation in these new markets, the trader has to be a legal occupant. Thats why there is such a rush, said Soumen Maulik, superintendent, civic markets.

 But all these years, these stall-owners did not register their names as legal occupants to save on rent and escape the stallage charges. 

 For third parties, the rent goes up by 25 per cent and stallage charge is 400 times the enhanced rent, added Maulik. 

 At present, the daily rent for stalls in civic markets varies between 15 and 20 paise per square foot.

 So, the monthly rent for a standard 200-sq-ft stall is around Rs 900. For a third party, it would be Rs 1,125. 

 It means most of these traders saved around Rs 4 to Rs 5 lakh by not registering their names as legal stall-owners with us, explained Maulik. 

 As rehabilitation in the new market complexes is the main concern of the stall-owners, their association is telling the members to change the names at the earliest. 

 If the third parties do not get the civic market records corrected by paying the stallage charges, they will lose their rights So, we are telling all our members to follow the rule, said Pradip Chakraborty of SS Hogg Market Shopkeepers Welfare Association.

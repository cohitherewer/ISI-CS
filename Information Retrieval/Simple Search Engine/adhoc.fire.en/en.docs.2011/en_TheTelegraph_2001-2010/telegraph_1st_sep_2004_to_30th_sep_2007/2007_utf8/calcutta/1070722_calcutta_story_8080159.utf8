 Not many know her name, but her face is very familiar. She has stood behind the counter of one of the most well-known shops in the city for decades.

 Chetenyangjom Sherpa first came to Calcutta as a girl of about 13 with her parents. Back then, she would come down from the Darjeeling hills in winter to trade in Tibetan curio, till demand from the customers led her to make Calcutta her home and open Chamba Lama. The name is derived from Gyawa Chamba, which means the coming Buddha, the Buddha of Maitreyi (friendship).

 The Calcutta connection began almost 60 years ago. Now no lover of ethnic silver jewellery in the city can remember a time when she or he didnt shop at the shop. Theres more than jewellery there one can also spend hours browsing through the clutter of copper, brass and silver artefacts, the trays of earrings, rings and bracelets, the strings of beads and chunky pendants.

 Initially, I used to trade more in curio and copper and brass ware than silver jewellery. In the past 15 years, the focus has shifted to silver jewellery. Copper and curio today are picked up only by the true collector, says the jolly old woman, who says she is around 70 now. 

 Calcutta in the 1940s was very different, remembers Chetenyangjom. In 1949, when I first started coming here, Calcutta was a very clean city. There were many Britishers. Some of them still come back. 

 Before Chamba Lama happened, Chetenyangjom and her parents sold their ware on Park Street, in front of AN John. Many foreign ships used to visit the port then. My grandfather used to supply curio to them too, says Tshering Yangki, Chetenyangjoms daughter.

 But Chetenyangjoms parents would not stay in Calcutta beyond winter. So the rest of the time, it was left to her to run the store. It must have been hard work for her, but this was the only trade she knew and she persisted. After her marriage, which happened not long after the store was born, she had my father to help her, says Tshering. 

 According to her, Aparna Sen, Suchitra Sen, Irrfan Khan, Shivamani and Leslie Lewis have shopped at Chamba Lama. She says like Suchitra Sen, her daughter Moon Moon and now her daughters Riya and Raima, three generations from many families are her customers. 

 Their silver is good and the designs beautiful, says Debdatta Ganguly, a student at Jadavpur University who has shopping at Chamba Lama for six years. Harsha Khorana, a student at St Xaviers College, says he loves the place.

 The faces behind the counters have also changed. Chetenyangjom is not involved in the daily business. Daughter Tshering and daughter-in-law Norkila Sherpa run the store.

 I started working at Chamba Lama after college. Norkila is also from Darjeeling, says Tshering. The collection has also changed. They used to get the ware from Tibet. It is now bought from Nepal. We are also experimenting with Bengali karigars. 

 But Tshering and Norkila dont know if their children will work for the store. In Tibetan we have a saying that we know only today. When we sleep, who knows whether we will wake up again? asks Chetenyangjom with a twinkle in her eye.

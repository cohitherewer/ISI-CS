The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Loss of match, loss of appetite

 It is not just cricket fans who are finding the bashing at the hands of Bangladesh hard to swallow. Restaurants and nightclubs banking on our batting order are in serious danger of losing their appetite if Team India fails to make it to the Super Eight.

 This is traditionally a lean season and we had pinned our hopes on the World Cup mood, especially with the matches being played at night. But if India cannot make it beyond the group stage, business will be hit for six. Who will want to come out and watch matches on our big screen if India is knocked out? feared the manager of a nightclub.

 A host of food festivals and contests are being run by eateries keen to cash in on the cricket crowds. After being beaten and bruised by Bangladesh, all fingers were crossed on Monday evening. None more so than at 20G Park Street.

 Thats Souravs: The Food Pavilion, waiting to serve up Souravs Punch, Caribbean Crabs and more. We are praying that the Indian team strikes form against Bermuda and then beats Sri Lanka. That will definitely boost business, said Saikat Sarkar, general manager, Souravs.

 The cricket-means-business confession is candid from Vinay Jaiswal, director, operations, HHI: Our business is directly proportional to Indias performance on the field. People who are watching the match in a nightclub or restaurant get disgusted if India plays badly. That hits business. The Cricket Fever festival at the HHI lounge bar Virgose will fizzle out if Team India fails to fire.

 If the entertainment merchants are jittery, so are the bookies. The situation in Group B is very complex and if Team India does not win big on Monday, it would be in danger of coming home early. If both India and Pakistan are knocked out, the betting bazaar will go cold, said a Burrabazar bookie.

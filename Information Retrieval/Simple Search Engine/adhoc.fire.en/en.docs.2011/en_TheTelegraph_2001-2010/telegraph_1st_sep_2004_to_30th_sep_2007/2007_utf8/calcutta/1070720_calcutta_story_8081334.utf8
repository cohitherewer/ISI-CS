The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Muggles wait for Saturday

 - Blast-off begins to seventh and final book on boy wizard

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

 The sun will rise over Calcutta at 5.05am on Saturday. But the sun over the Muggle world will not rise till 6.30am on Saturday.

 For that is when the first copies of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows will start flying off the racks in city bookstores.

 Who lives? Who dies? Does Ron get together with Hermione? Does Harry find all the Horcruxes?

 Answers to the most frequently asked Harry Potter questions will start trickling out as the seventh and final book of the J.K. Rowling franchise nestles in the nervous hands of Potter fanatics.

 The countdown to blast-off begins at 5.30pm on Friday, with the t2 PotterWriter Contest winners all students reading out their versions of the final chapter at Crossword and grabbing a host of prizes.

 The fun carries on at the Crossword through the night. Never in the history of Calcutta has such a store been kept open all night. We have never done so much promotional activity before any Harry Potter book, says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword, which will stay open on Friday night with a treasure hunt for kids so that fans of the boy wizard dont have to queue up outside the Elgin Road store at dawn.

 Advance bookings for Harry Potter have never had it so good in India. At last count, it read 240,000, a good 80,000 copies more than what Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince had sold in 2005.

 Harry Potter is a stupendous global phenomenon, and the interest around the publication of The Deathly Hallows is unprecedented, says Hemali Sodhi, head of marketing and promotions, Penguin Books India, official distributors of Bloomsbury in India.

 Despite all the Pottermania in town, the humbling fact remains that with around 22,000 copies coming into the eastern region, it lags way behind the rest of the country, with the south ordering over 87,000, the north 80,000 and the west 40,000.

 Among the city stores, Oxford leads the Potter demand pack with over 2,000 pre-bookings and 500 online bookings. We have placed an order for about 10,000 copies, said Rajiv Chowdhury, CEO, Apeejay Oxford Bookstores.

 At Starmark, the Potter party begins on Friday with fancy dress, quiz contest, housie, crafts contest and more. We are doing up the entire store based on the Harry Potter theme, says Gautam Jatia at the Lord Sinha Road store.

 Blockade by schoolgirls

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Students of Ramkrishna Upanibesh Vivekananda Vidyapith for Girls blocked Raja Subodh Mullick Road on Monday afternoon, disrupting traffic for hours. The students wanted the arrest of school secretary Jayanta Sarkar.

 Headmistress Seema Sengupta has accused Sarkar of molesting students, assaulting teachers and misappropriating school funds.

 The blockade was not lifted till late in the evening. The school, in Jadavpur, was closed on Monday and the students, teachers and guardians held a meeting on the spot. 

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta said: We could not force the students to lift the blockade. We had to persuade them to disperse.

 Trouble has been brewing since Sarkar was elected secretary two years ago. He was involved in a scuffle with the teachers and the headmistress on the schools premises on Saturday. Local borough chairman Batakrishna Roy and other CPM leaders were with Sarkar at the time. 

 Sengupta has lodged an FIR against Sarkar and complained against him to Left Front chairman Biman Bose and the state human rights commission.

 Sarkar alleged: Sengupta was repeatedly asked by the managing committee to be more responsible, but to no avail.

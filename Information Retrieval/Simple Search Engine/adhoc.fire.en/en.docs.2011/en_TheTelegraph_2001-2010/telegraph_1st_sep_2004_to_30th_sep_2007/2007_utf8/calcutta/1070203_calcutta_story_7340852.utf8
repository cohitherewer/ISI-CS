 In a welcome departure from routine, the city civic authorities have embarked on an integrated urban renewal initiative to revive Calcuttas choked central business district, with advice from experts and by involving all the stakeholders.

 Dalhousie Square is a special zone, which was the administrative hub when Europe was reshaping the Orient. The sheer historic significance of this district calls for a celebration and we have decided on a consensual roadmap to restore it to its former neo-classical glory, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay tells Metro.

 The primary elements identified for the layered rejuvenation programme are sidewalks, railings, illumination, signage and landscaping, according to architect and urban designer Partha Ranjan Das, anchoring the design solution for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation project.

 A 300-m strip from the GPO to Clive Row has been earmarked for the pilot project, set to cost around Rs 1 crore. An advisory panel, comprising the likes of senior architects Prabir Mitra and Dulal Mukherjee, artist Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, conservation expert Samir Rakshit, restoration architect Manish Chakrabarti and green activist Bonani Kakkar is providing critical inputs.

 From redesigning junction boxes of Calcutta Telephones and CESC and garbage vats to relaying the pavements with grey and black granite for the old cobblestone feel and defining the edges by shifting lamp posts and using cast-iron bollards its a multi-pronged approach, explains Das.

 Replacing concrete foundations holding tree trunks by iron tree guards, installing more ornamental lamps for better illumination, transplanting fruit-bearing trees near Laldighi and redesigning police kiosks to meld with the new clutter-free ambience are some of the other plans.

 Both directional and informative signage will be embossed on a metal plate, often with a short history of the building inscribed. We are also redesigning all the iron railings, taking the one in front of Bankshal Court as the prototype, he adds.

 Methodologically, by broad-basing the approach and involving all the stakeholders, we have also kept provision for a mid-stream course correction, if required, stresses Bandyopadhyay. In the second phase, a basic restoration design template for the ground floors of all the buildings will be provided to the respective owners.

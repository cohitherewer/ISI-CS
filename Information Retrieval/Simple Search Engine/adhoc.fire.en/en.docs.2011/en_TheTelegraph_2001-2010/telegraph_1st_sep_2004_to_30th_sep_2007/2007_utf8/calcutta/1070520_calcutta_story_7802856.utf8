 Waterbodies 

 Stat Talk 

 Calcutta is no Venice, but it had close to 4,000 waterbodies in the mid-90s, according to a Calcutta Municipal Corporation report. However, encroachment and illegal filling-up of ponds, mainly for construction of buildings during the last decade, has diminished the number significantly. Now they number around 3,500.

 It is alarming that about 95 per cent of these are located in Jadavpur, Behala, Garden Reach or the eastern fringes areas that are witnessing most of the realty action. A Central Pollution Control Board report observed that the water-bodies in Calcutta they pegged the number at 2,000 are under serious threat from the realty lobby. 

 The report says 95 per cent of the waterbodies and ponds are used for bathing and 86 per cent for pisciculture. It estimates that about half a million people use the city waterbodies daily and they are a major water resource for poorer sections of the society. Many of them are extremely polluted.

 Unseasonal rain, accompanied by gusts of wind, put paid to Calcuttans hopes of watching Sourav Ganguly hit his maiden 100 at Eden Gardens in the One Day International against Sri Lanka on Thursday.

 And the weathers unlikely to improve over the next couple of days. The Met office said on Thursday that the showers are expected to continue in Calcutta and the adjoining districts for the next 48 hours.

 We detected on the radar tall columns of clouds over the city and the neighbouring districts. We see more rain, said an official of the regional meteorological office at Alipore.

 The weatherman attributed the showers primarily to a massive build-up of clouds over Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24-Parganas and coastal Midnapore.

 A trough of low pressure extending from Chhattisgarh to the Northeast resulted in the formation of clouds since Wednesday evening, explained the official. 

 As air has a tendency to move from high pressure to low, the trough is sucking in moisture from the Bay of Bengal, he added.

 A cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise circulation of air) over Bangladesh and Gangetic Bengal has also contributed to the incursion of moisture.

 This circulation, too, is drawing moisture from the Bay. The cumulative impact of the two atmospheric conditions is the cloud formation since yesterday, stated another Met official.

 There has been intermittent incursion of moisture from the Bay over the past fortnight. This manifested itself in the form of dense, early-morning fog in the city and its adjoining areas. Calcuttans on Thursday woke up to an overcast sky and cold wind. The weather is likely to remain pleasant, with the minimum temperature hovering around 19 degrees Celsius.

 If there is a heavy cover of clouds, the sun cannot shine through and hence, the mercury cannot shoot up. Since the incursion of moisture from the sea is continuing, the sky is expected to remain partly cloudy. Consequently, the next couple of days will be cool, said a Met official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta, Bhopal, Dubai

 - Held Bangla hitmen were hired by oil firm employee

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dubai-based Tapan Sarkar had employed Bangladeshi criminals Chandanmoy Nandi and Tamzit Ahmed to murder his relative Swapan Dey, a trader in Bhopal, claimed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Wednesday. 

 Tapans wife Shukla had left him with their three children and was living with Swapans family. The employee of a Dubai oil company, who is Nandis cousin, wanted her to return. He also wanted to get back the property he had purchased in Shuklas name.

 The CID, however, ruled out the possibility of the Bangladeshis crossing over, camping on the citys outskirts for months and hiring local goons only to murder the Bhopal trader. The sleuths said Nandi had taken a hefty payment from his cousin for the assignment. A part of the amount was spent on hiring local goons. 

 Tapan wanted to kill Swapan ever since his wife Shukla and their kids started living with the 43-year-old traders family, said P. Nirajnayan, deputy inspector general (CID). Tapan was also keen to get back properties bought in his wifes name.

 The Sarkars live in Bhopal. After Tapan left for Dubai, Shukla and their kids moved in with the Deys

 Tapan tried to make Shukla return but failed. A year-and-a-half ago, he had filed a complaint in court, alleging that Swapan had forcibly taken away his wife, said a senior officer of the CID. 

 The Bhopal assignment was not the only reason the contract killers came to Calcutta. We will get to know their motives only after a detailed interrogation, he added.

 Nandi, cops believe, had links in Madhyamgram, which prompted him to settle in the area and look for local goons.

 Apparently, Nandi and Tamzit were involved in procurement of arms. That explains why we found two 9 mm pistols on them. While interrogating Supriyo Nandy, another Bangladeshi national held in connection with a murder, we learnt that some Bangladeshi nationals were involved in the arms trade, said the officer. 

 Nandi and Tamzit have been remanded in police custody for 10 days.

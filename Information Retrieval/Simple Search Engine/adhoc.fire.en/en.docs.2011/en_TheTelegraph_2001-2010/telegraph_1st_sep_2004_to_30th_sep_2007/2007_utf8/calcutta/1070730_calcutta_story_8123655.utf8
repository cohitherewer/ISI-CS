 The devils deal

 EZCCs monthly theatre show features Banijya Bistar (a scene from the play appears right), a play that recalls Christopher Marlowes Dr Faustus. It unfolds the story of Sikander, a man of poor means, who becomes an easy victim of avarice. One night, he meets Shylok, a stranger who claims to be a businessman who buys whatever is offered for sale. He proposes to buy anything that Sikander may possess, even his past, and offers for it an unimaginably high price. Sikander sells his past and becomes a rich man. He buys a car and returns home armed with expensive goods and fashionable dresses for his family. Stricken by greed, Sikander now wants to sell all else that he possesses to Shylok, including the future of his son. His family is shocked and frightened. They try to reason with him, but in vain. Sikander also tries to free himself from greed, but it is too late as he has already sold his soul to the devil. Direction: Ashoke Pramanick.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Banijya Bistar, produced by Blind Opera When: Today at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

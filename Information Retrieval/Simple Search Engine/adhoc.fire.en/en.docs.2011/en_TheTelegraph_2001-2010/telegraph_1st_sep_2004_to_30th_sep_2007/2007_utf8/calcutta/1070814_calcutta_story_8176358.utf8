 Library in comeback mode 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The MMB library before it was closed down three years ago

 The Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB) library will soon be back, in a touch-feel avatar.

 The library, in its physical format, will return early next year. But unlike the 15,000-odd titles it held then, the new-style library will have around 5,000 books, says Reimar Volker, the new MMB director.

 The popular library on the German cultural institutes 8 Ballygunge Circular Road premises was shut down three years ago following concerns about sustainability among the Goethe-Institut brass in Berlin. A virtual library in the form of a resource centre took its place.

 The comeback library will be small and beautiful, cutting-edge and fast-reacting to current trends, promises Volker. The stress will be on English translations of German literature, with a special focus on India, and efforts will be made to make the library very accessible and interactive.

 Marilen Daun, South Asia head of the libraries of Goethe-Institut, is helping with the re-launch of the Calcutta library of MMB, which will include an audio-visual section and a cosy reading corner.

 We hope the return of the library will help us renew the special bond with Calcutta, smiles Volker, who has also been to some leading city schools to establish this connect at the grassroots level.

 MMB is rolling out a project involving students of city schools. Charpashe encourages children to shoot pictures of their immediate environment on a digital camera, as a medium to build bridges. The institute is also doing a childrens theatre project Akash Mati, Haoa, Jol an adaptation of a Grips Theatre production by Jayati Bose.

 MMB is also connecting with strains of music, across genres. A baul concert with Rathin Kisku is scheduled for August 16, while Signum, a classical string quartet, will perform on September 12 at St Johns Church.

 Lychee Lassi, a groovy jazz-rock band from Germany, with DJ Illvibe spinning vinyl at the console, will rock Tantra in October.

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 A gang of criminals active in the southern parts of the country is using Calcutta as a haven and had holed up in the city for over two months. 

 Trailing the criminals, involved in nearly 100 burglaries in and around Chennai in the past four years, three Chennai Police teams arrived in Calcutta three days ago with the objective of flushing them out and bringing them to justice. 

 For a change, Calcutta Police normally taken by surprise with the operations of police from other states is aware of the activities of its counterparts from Chennai. 

 The teams are led by an assistant commissioner, Shaukat Ali. They have got two notorious burglars, arrested in January, along with them to get to the other gang members, Tarun Mitra, officer-in-charge of Muchipara police station, told Metro. 

 According to police, all the criminals hail from Bangladesh, and had used the porous Indo-Bangladeshi border to sneak into the state and then head south. 

 Known as grille thieves, the gang members had a unique modus operandi of hawking bedsheets by the day and robbing houses after sundown. 

 Most of the times, they targeted temporarily locked houses, unfastening the grilles of windows and breaking in, said a police officer. 

 According to estimates, the gang had stolen 1,358 gold sovereigns, worth Rs 1.15 crore, and over Rs 23 lakh in cash over the past four years. 

 In January this year, a Chennai Police team arrested 11 members of the gang from Jadavpur in a joint operation with West Bengal Police. 

 Investigations had revealed that the gang members were from Madaripur district of Bangladesh. 

 Some of the gang members have passports and use Calcutta as their transit point. We have alerted the Border Security Force about it, a senior IPS officer said.

 Officers of the detective department and Criminal Investigation Department are also assisting the Chennai team to nab the gang members.

 We have picked up 10 burglars from across the city over the past couple of days and they have given us some clues, an officer of anti-burglary section said.

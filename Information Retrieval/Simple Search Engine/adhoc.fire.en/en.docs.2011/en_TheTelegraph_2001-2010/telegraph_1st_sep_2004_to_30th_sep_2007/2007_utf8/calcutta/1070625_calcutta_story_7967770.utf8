 He used to walk into seminars as a delegate and leave with the laptops of invitees. Sudip Singhas luck ran out last week when officers of the detective department arrested him in Karaya. 

 Four stolen laptops, including one that the detectives had been trying to trace, were found in the possession of the suave man in his mid-40s. 

 Singha had been arrested thrice for stealing electronic goods. But this is the first time he has been held for stealing laptops, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Gyanwant Singh.

 A network marketing company had complained to police that a laptop had gone missing during a seminar at Haldiram Food Plaza. More than 50 delegates attended the seminar and the complainants could not provide us any lead, said the officer-in-charge of the watch section, Asish Sengupta.

 The officers went through the footage of the closed-circuit cameras. It showed Singha, posing as a delegate, leaving the hall with a laptop during a tea break. We asked the organisers about him, but no one could recognise him, said Sengupta.

 The detectives then went through the records of the citys lifters and came across information about Singha.

 We activated our informants and arrested him in his rented apartment, said deputy commissioner Singh.

 Singha, whose father is a motor parts trader in Metiabruz, has confessed to stealing the seized laptops. He said he had also stolen laptops from Howrah and Sealdah railway stations and bus stops.

 His family disowned him after he was arrested twice for stealing, said an officer.

 We are trying to find out if Singha had committed crimes other than stealing electronic goods in the recent past, added the officer.

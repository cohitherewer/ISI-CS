The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pool cars run amok minus rein

 - Registration set to miss deadline

 RISKY RIDE: Schoolchildren packed in a poolcar. A Telegraph picture 

 Two accidents and the death of a Class III student have not jolted the authorities into reining in the errant pool cars.

 Last month, the government had issued a nine-point guideline for pool cars carrying children to school and back home. Not a single vehicle has yet been registered, the last date for which is August 15.

 Kaustav Bhattacharya, a student of South Point School, died when the illegal pool car in which he was travelling to school with other children crashed into a bus on VIP Road on July 19.

 Last Thursday, a vehicle packed with 13 schoolchildren lost control while trying to overtake another pool car, rammed into a lamp post and mounted the divider on James Long Sarani, before overturning. Four children were admitted to a nursing home with multiple injuries.

 An official attributed the non-enforcement of the guideline registration is a key component of it to a lack of communication between government departments.

 The public vehicles department, an official claimed, has not yet received any intimation from the transport department about the guidelines issued on July 25.

 We have only read in papers that the transport department has announced some guidelines for the pool cars. But since we have not been informed about them in writing, we cannot carry out the registration process, said an official of the regional transport authority. 

 The owners of a few pool cars did approach us and we handed over the forms to them. We cannot do much else right now, said the official.

 The guidelines state that the vehicles must have a permit to operate as pool cars, the number of kids in a vehicle should not be more than the number of seats and that every vehicle should have an escort.

 The government is not bothered about the safety of our children. Its shocking that a copy of the guideline has not moved from one department to another since July 25, said P. Mukherjee, the mother of a classmate of Kaustav.

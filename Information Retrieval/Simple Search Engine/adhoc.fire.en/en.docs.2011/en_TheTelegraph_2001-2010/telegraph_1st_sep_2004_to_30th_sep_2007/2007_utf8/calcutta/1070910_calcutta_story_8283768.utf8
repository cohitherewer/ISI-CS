 Implant for disc 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Himangshu Ghosh, a senior official in a public sector undertaking, slipped down a staircase. Apart from the usual aches, Ghosh, in his mid-40s, developed a rather unusual symptom a severe burning sensation and pain in both hands.

 Tests revealed that Ghoshs cervical disc between two vertebrae was damaged, resulting in compression of the nerve roots. He was advised surgery. 

 A damaged cervical disc is usually replaced by a graft taken from the pelvic bone. But in Ghoshs case, the damaged disc was replaced with an artificial disc.

 This is the latest high-tech titanium ball and trough joint, which allow normal movement of the neck immediately after the operation, said L.N. Tripathy, a consultant neuro surgeon at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Calcutta. Tripathy had led the team of surgeons that operated on Ghosh.

 The spinal cord, which carries signals to and from the brain, is protected by a vertebral column a series of vertebrae. In between the vertebral bones, there are soft jelly-like cervical discs that are vital for the movement of the spine. 

 Because of the damage in the cervical disc, the nerves carrying impulse to hands were affected, resulting in the burning sensation and pain, said Tripathi.

 In the traditional technique of operation, the movement of the neck gets restricted as the vertebrae are fused after bone grafting. To compensate for the lack of movement, the adjacent vertebrae bear the extra stress, which can later cause complications. Besides, removal of a bone from the pelvic region causes pain.

 The cervical implant, on the other hand, does not involve a surgery of the pelvic bone and the recovery period is much shorter than in the traditional method. Usually, the patient is discharged a day after the operation.

 Another equipment has been introduced in the city for curbing slipped disc pain spinal cord stimulator.

 This can be successfully used on patients with slipped discs who cannot undergo an operation, said Goutam Das, a specialist in spinal cord stimulator implant.

 The pain in the legs because of a slipped disc is intolerable and often leaves a patient invalid. In 10 per cent of the cases, back surgery fails to provide any relief to the patient, Das said. Like a pacemaker, the stimulator generates current that suppresses the pain signals sent by the damaged nerves, he added.

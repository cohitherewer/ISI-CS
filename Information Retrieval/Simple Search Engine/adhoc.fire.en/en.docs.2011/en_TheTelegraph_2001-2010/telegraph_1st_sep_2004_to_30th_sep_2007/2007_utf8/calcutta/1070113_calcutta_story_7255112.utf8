 - Land handover suffers setback with last-minute switch of consultant

 The beginning-of-the-year target for handover of 100 acres to Infosys for its city hub is set to be missed, with the state government changing the consultant for the Rajarhat Infocity project during the final countdown.

 The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) has made it public that Infrastructure Leasing and Finance Services (IL amp;FS) is no longer in charge of plotting, mapping and planning for the project, but the companys officials are in the dark. This is news to us, was how an official of IL amp;FS, a infrastructure management and consultancy company, reacted when informed of the chop and change.

 There was nothing being done that required the involvement of IL amp;FS, was all a senior WBIDC officer would offer by way of explanation.

 The new consultant will be Institute of Environmental and Social Management, a state agency. It has submitted proposals for the project to WBIDC. Around 800 acres of low-lying land opposite Vedic Village (10 km from the airport), is being acquired for the development of Rajarhat Action Area III. Between 200 and 300 acres of the zone will comprise Rajarhat Infocity. Within it, Infosys has been allocated 100 acres, Wipro 50 acres and ITC Infotech 50 acres. The rest of the information technology (IT) plots will be shared by smaller firms and biotech companies.

 The Infosys project has been languishing for more than nine months due to non-availability of a detailed map. ITC, too, has not had better luck. We are waiting for the government to get back to us with a detailed proposal containing the exact location of the allocated land, said an official on behalf of ITC Infotech.

 State IT minister Debesh Das had recently announced a March-April 2007 deadline to hand over land to Infosys. I cannot contradict my minister. I can only say that the process has been initiated. These things take time, a lot of time, stressed a WBIDC official on Friday.

 According to an IT department source, IL amp;FS had been given the responsibility of preparing a detailed map, plotting the site for each company and existing and probable connecting roads but had failed to deliver over the past seven to eight months. So, a shuffle was on the cards.

 Officials of the department in touch with Infosys said the company is willing to wait for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments proposal.

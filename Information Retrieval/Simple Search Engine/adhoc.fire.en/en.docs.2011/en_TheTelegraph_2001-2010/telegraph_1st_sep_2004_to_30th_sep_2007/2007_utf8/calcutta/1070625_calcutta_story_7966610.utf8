 Penniless parents fight cancer

 Four-year-old Sushamoy Chandra is fighting blood cancer. But a tougher battle is being fought by his parents an unemployed father and a housewife mother to gather money for his treatment.

 The symptoms were noticed in June last year and in August, Sushamoy was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).

 Parthapratim and Chandrani, residents of Behrampore, immediately brought their son to a nursing home in Dhakuria. But the doctors told us that chemotherapy would cost Rs 7 lakh. We did not have that much money and had to return home to collect funds, said Parthapratim, who lost his job in a two-wheeler showroom a few months ago.

 The couple managed to raise a lakh, by selling part of their property and from donations from relatives, neighbours and local clubs. They again came to Calcutta with Sushamoy and after getting him treated at a few nursing homes, approached a private cancer centre in Salt Lake.

 But by this time, all our funds were exhausted. The only option left was to sell our house. I wrote to the district magistrate, chief minister and even the Prime Minister, but there has been no response, recalled Parthapratim. The family survives on the meagre income of his father, who works as a law clerk.

 Just when the child was showing signs of improvement, the penniless parents were forced to discontinue the treatment and take the child back home.

 But we could no longer see him suffer and again started looking for money. One of my friends, Krishnajit Sengupta, helped raise Rs 30,000. With the amount, I fell at the feet of my sons doctor, U. Mani, who finally admitted him, Parthapratim said.

 Mani said Sushamoys chances of recovery would have been more had the treatment started earlier. Around 40 per cent of ALL-L2 patients get cured. But I am afraid the couple need to collect Rs 4 lakh more and have no clue how they will do it. I am trying my best, Mani said.

 Parthapratim and Chandrani, too, are clueless, though they are determined to get the best possible treatment for their son.

 State Bank of India has opened an account in Parthapratims name at the Bikash Bhavan branch to help the parents encash donation cheques/drafts.

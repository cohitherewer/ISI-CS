The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Every auto is lawless

 A STAFF REPORTER

 STREET ILLEGAL: The autorickshaw in Calcutta. A Telegraph picture

 Around 60,000 autorickshaws ply in the city. And not one plies legally.

 The state transport department has stumbled upon the startling fact while working on strategies to slam the brakes on autos plying without a proper road permit.

 Autos, like taxis, are commercial vehicles that run on a contract carriage permit. The rules state that vehicles under this category should run on a meter and should not have any assigned routes. Also, they cannot have any permanent stand, said a transport department official.

 Autos violate all three conditions of the permit.

 There are two types of commercial permits contract carriage permit and stage carriage permit. Autos enjoy all the benefits that are granted to buses under the stage carriage permit, thanks to political patronage, the official pointed out. 

 Like buses, autos do not run on a meter and ply on specific routes chosen by the owners. They also have fixed stands, like buses, that often encroach on busy roads. But unlike buses, passengers travelling in autos are not issued tickets.

 Most auto-owners are affiliated to Citu, that works like a parallel administrative body. It issues route maps and fare charts without the transport departments consent, the official said.

 All attempts by the public vehicles department (PVD) and police to take punitive action against illegal autos have been thwarted by Citu. 

 Citu state president Shyamal Chakraborty said the autos would no longer remain a cheap mode of transport if they were to run on a meter.

 The transport department official, however, asserted that a guideline was being prepared to curb the illegal activities of auto-owners. We will restrict the number of autos on each route. Besides, they may soon have to operate like taxis.

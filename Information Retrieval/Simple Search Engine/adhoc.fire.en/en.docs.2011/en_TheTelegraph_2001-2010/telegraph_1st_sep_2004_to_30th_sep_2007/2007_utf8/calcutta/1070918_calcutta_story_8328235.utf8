The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mishap petition in court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The recent spate of road mishaps in the city came under the scanner of Calcutta High Court on Monday, when the division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar admitted a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding its intervention.

 Advocate Tanmoy Goswami moved the PIL with a list of accidents that had claimed at least 23 lives from August 9 to August 31. The petitioner told the court that the government should be forced to take measures to curb such mishaps.

 The Telegraph has been carrying out a campaign against killer wheels for the past four weeks.

 The bench asked the state to file an affidavit stating the prevalent situation of the city roads and also the course of action, if any, it had taken to prevent accidents.

 A year ago, the same bench had passed a suo motu order, asking the state government to file a report stating the action it had taken against the drivers and conductors of killer buses. The state is yet to submit its report.

 Drivers and conductors work on commission basis. This should be abolished to control overtaking and rash driving, said Goswami. Stern action should be taken against reckless drivers.

 Basabi Roy Chowdhury, appearing for the state, said: Whatever the state has to say will be put in the affidavit.

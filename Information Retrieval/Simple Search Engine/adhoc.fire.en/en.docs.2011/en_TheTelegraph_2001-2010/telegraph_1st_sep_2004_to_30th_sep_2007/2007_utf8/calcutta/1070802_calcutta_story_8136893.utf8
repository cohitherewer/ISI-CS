 Two toughs, one of them dangling a revolver, chased a traffic constable down Karl Marx Sarani, in Kidderpore, in full public view on Thursday evening.

 Witnesses said a tiff over sharing money collected from an illegal parking lot had led to the role reversal they had seen only in films.

 Around 5.30pm, some local toughs were busy counting money they had collected from the illegal parking lot near Fancy Market, when two constables of Watgunge police station turned up to ask for their share.

 The goons refused, resulting in an altercation between them and one of the cops. The constable was chased down the road by the toughs, one of whom was brandishing a revolver, said Alamgir Hossain, a witness, who works in a shop at Five Star Market.

 The duo chased the constable till Mansatala, where they retreated on seeing a police jeep.

 We have seen criminals chasing policemen in films. This was the first time we came across such a scene in reality, said a local resident.

 This is bound to happen if cops develop a habit of rubbing shoulders with criminals, said another resident.

 An investigation is on and we are trying to arrest the goons, said an officer of Watgunge police station.

 Metro had earlier reported how Karl Marx Sarani, a busy thoroughfare, had been turned into an illegal parking lot by a section of policemen and local criminals.

 Vehicles are allowed to park right in the middle of the road, between Five Star Market and Babubazar, for a fee as high as Rs 100 for a couple of hours.

 The rate is not fixed, though, as the criminals, with the backing of some policemen, extort as much as they can from vehicle-owners.

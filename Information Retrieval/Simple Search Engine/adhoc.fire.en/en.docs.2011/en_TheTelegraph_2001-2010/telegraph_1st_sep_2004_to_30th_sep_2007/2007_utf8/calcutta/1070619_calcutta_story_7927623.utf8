 Dispute over licence fee

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Over 500,000 businesses are being run in the city with expired trade licences following a dispute between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and banks over payment of a service charge. 

 Traders have to renew their licences in April every year by depositing money at banks mentioned on the back of the renewal notice. Till March last year, the banks used to accept the payments on behalf of the CMC free of cost.

 Some banks subsequently declined to render the service unless the civic authorities pay a service charge for each transaction from April 2007. Since the dispute has not been resolved, the civic authorities could not print the renewal notice in March this year.

 How can we print the renewal notice without a list banks on it? asked a revenue official of the CMC.

 When traders fail to renew their licences, the CMC often puts up a notice on the walls of their establishments. Now, when the civic body has failed to send the renewal notice, it should apologise to the traders, said Taraknath Tribedi of Federation of Traders Organisation.

 Officers in the civic revenue department feel that the CMCs earnings from the renewal of trade licences in 2007-08 will be hit because of this impasse. 

 Four banks Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, United Bank of India and Bank of India had been accepting trade licence renewal fees on behalf of the civic body. At the beginning of this year, the three banks apart from Bank of India told the CMC that they would not accept trade licence renewal fees unless the civic body pays them a service charge of Rs 5 per transaction.

 Since paying service charge to the banks for the collection of trade licence renewal fees means outsourcing of a civic service, the CMC will have to take a policy decision.

 A civic accounts officer said the CMC will have to pay about Rs 25 lakh as service charge for the collection of Rs 40 crore as renewal fees. It roughly comes to an expense of 60 paise for the collection every Rs 100.

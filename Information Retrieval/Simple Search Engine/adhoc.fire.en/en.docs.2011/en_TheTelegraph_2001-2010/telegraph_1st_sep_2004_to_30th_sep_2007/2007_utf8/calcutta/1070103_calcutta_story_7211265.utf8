 Year 2007 is special for Calcutta Club. At the stroke of midnight on December 31, the club at 241 AJC Bose Road stepped into its centenary year.

 With the centenary preparations on in full swing, club members can look forward to a string of cultural and social events that began with a bang on New Years Eve. 

 Our centenary year celebrations started at the stroke of midnight. The yearlong celebrations will be on from January 1 till December 31, says Dipak Mukherjee, president of Calcutta Club. 

 Taking the club forward in its 100th year means that extra bit of hard work and living up to greater expectations. 

 The centenary year of Calcutta Club is very important for us and quite difficult at the same time. It is an inheritance of a legacy, which may be likened to batons changing hands in a relay race, says Mukherjee.

 One looks back with nostalgia and at the same time there is a vision of the future that will carry the club forward for betterment of society and also pragmatic views, explains the president.

 The celebrations for the year will revolve around festivities and fellowship with the chosen theme being Memories and Nostalgia.

 On New Years Eve, beats from a military band marked the first round of celebrations.

 During the countdown to midnight, the president raised a toast to the good health of the club and the members joined him in his toast. Nostalgic numbers like Auld Lang Syne filled the winter air.

 For the New Year, the managing committee has several functions lined up. On January 6 and 7, we will organise a classical music concert with Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Pandit Ullas Kashalkar and Ustad Rashid Khan, said Kalyan Choudhury, chairman, centenary projects and house building. 

 The International Evening of the centenary year will be organised on January 20 and a national debate will be held sometime in February-March. 

 Festivities will reach a crescendo on April 15 founders day of Calcutta Club with a classical music programme and much pomp.

 While all this is on the entertainment menu, the club will also wear a new look to welcome its 100th year.

 The Calcutta Club The Telegraph Hall of Fame is the new and revamped look that the club hall has recently sported. Even the lounge and the main seating area on the ground floor have been spruced up and the woodwork on the furniture wears a period design. Special lighting has been fixed on the club premises too. 

 We are ready for the centenary year, smiles the president.

 And is Calcutta Club ready for some more important changes? Recently, there was talk of the club opening membership to women.

 We will shed some of the old, which is not befitting to the future, is all that Mukherjee reveals.

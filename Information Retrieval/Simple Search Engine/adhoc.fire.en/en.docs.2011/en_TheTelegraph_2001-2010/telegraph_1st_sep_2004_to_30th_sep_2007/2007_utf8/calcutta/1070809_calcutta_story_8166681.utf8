 HS scrutiny in a month

 - Mistakes in results admitted, council cuts reassessment time 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state Higher Secondary (HS) council has resigned itself to the fact that its results will never be error-free.

 But in an attempt to ensure that students are not much inconvenienced by the mistakes, it has decided to announce scrutiny results within a month of the last date of receiving the applications.

 Scrutiny involves retotalling of marks and checking whether any answer has been left unmarked.

 The results of this years scrutiny were declared 37 days after the last date of receiving the applications. Last year, they were declared within 45 days. Till 2004, the council took nearly five months to declare the results.

 Council secretary Debashis Sarkar pointed out that the marks of 10 to 12 per cent of the students get changed after scrutiny. In most cases, the marks are increased.

 Mistakes in HS results are unavoidable, as we have to assess more than 50 lakh answer scripts a year. The errors are mostly committed by the examiners, claimed Sarkar.

 But we do not want the students to suffer. The examinees who apply for scrutiny should not remain in uncertainty for long. So, we are taking steps to declare the scrutiny results within a month of the last date of receiving the applications, said Sarkar.

 He, however, refused to disclose the number of students who had applied for scrutiny this year and how many of the results have changed. We will announce the figures after we finish compiling the results.

 Council sources said more than 10,000 HS examinees had applied for scrutiny in 2007. A large number of them have also appealed to Calcutta High Court, pleading for reassessment of their answer scripts.

 Officials pointed out that mistakes can crop up at any of the four stages of the evaluation. Some examiners do not evaluate all the answers, while some, by mistake, do not award marks to all the answers assessed.

 A few examiners err while adding the marks of each answer. In most cases, however, the mistake occurs in the fourth stage, when the examiner jots down the score of each examinee on a marks foil, said an official.

 Minors accuse father of rape

 - Police blamed for refusing to lodge complaint 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two girls, aged nine and 11, have accused their father of sexually abusing them for the past three months. Unable to bear the torture any more, the younger daughter approached her mother for help.

 Khokan Mullick, 42, is on the run following a complaint lodged against him by his wife with Nimta police station.

 We have received a complaint from Kamalika Mullick that her husband Khokan had raped her two daughters. We have sent the girls for medical examination. Khokan is absconding, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 The girls were taken to Sagar Dutta State General Hospital. We are awaiting the medical report before launching a probe. We have interrogated the girls and their mother, said Basab Dasgupta, the additional superintendent of police, Barrackpore. 

 The Mullicks live in Bardhanpara, ward No. 27 of North Dum Dum Municipality.

 Police said Khokan, a plumber, began to abuse his daughters sexually three months ago.

 We came to know about it after the younger girl complained to her mother, said Sunil Dey, a neighbour.

 According to Kamalikas police complaint, Khokan would abuse their daughters when she was away, working as an ayah.

 When my younger daughter came crying to me about how her father was attacking her, I could not believe my ears. She also told me how her elder sister was subjected to the same torture, said Kamalika.

 I lodged a complaint against my husband, as he has committed the most heinous crime, she stressed.

 On Wednesday night, as the word spread, neighbours alleged that when they went to Nimta police station to register a complaint against Khokan, the officials took the matter lightly and refused to register a case.

 We returned to keep a vigil for Khokan in the hope of catching him and taking him to the police station. But he must have realised that his game was up and there was no sign of him, said Dey.

 On Thursday morning, Kamalika went to Nimta police station to register a complaint against her husband.

 We accompanied her, as the thana had earlier refused to register the complaint. When this time, too, the cops turned down her plea to lodge a complaint, we demonstrated in front of the police station, forcing officials to finally register a complaint, said another neighbour of the Mullicks.

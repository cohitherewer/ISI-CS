 For a change, city civic authorities will make a documentary film on the citys past perfect, with special focus on heritage buildings.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has recently cleared a proposal for the film, which will explore the citys multicultural past, from the time when it was the capital of the Raj and a cradle of Bengal renaissance.

 The exchange of views, ideas and cultures between cities of different countries has changed like never before. This film will help visiting foreigners learn more about the cultural roots of Calcutta. And this will be helpful in promoting the citys interests, said the mayor.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the history outlined in the documentary will also help cosmopolitan Calcuttans develop a better understanding of their cultural past.

 We will take the help of Intach, historians and other professionals working on citys heritage to prepare the script, the commissioner added. 

 According to him: We want to roll out a professional documentary, which will be factually correct, informative and interesting. 

 However, there remains the need to redraw the list of heritage buildings in the city. The long list of 1,300 heritage structures has to be cut down, feel both the mayor and the commissioner.

 The connection to important historical occurrences and their architectural features will be the basic parameters to identify heritage structures, a civic heritage official said on Sunday.

 The process of identifying heritage structures is often problematic. Many buildings have been included in the heritage list just because Rabindranath Tagore had stayed there for a night, the official added.

 Anindya Karforma, director-general, project management unit, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, has been working on the revision of heritage list, the commissioner said.

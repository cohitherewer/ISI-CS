The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Civic man in fraud net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation 

A civic employee absconding for the past two months was arrested on Wednesday morning for his alleged role in the defalcation of Rs 18 lakh from the Gariahat treasury.

 A team from Gariahat police station picked up Asish Mukherjee, head assistant of the treasury, from a place near Ballygunge railway station, while he was on his way to meet a lawyer.

 Mukherjee has been found responsible for siphoning off Rs 3.48 lakh from the treasury, said an officer of Gariahat thana. He has been remanded in police custody till July 4.

 Debabrata Dirghangi, an accountant of the treasury, had been arrested earlier for the same crime.

 We have come across evidence of the involvement of Dirghangi and Mukherjee in the embezzlement, said P.K. Chatterjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters). 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation authorities had lodged a police complaint on April 4, a couple of weeks after detecting the theft.

 Chatterjee said Mukherjee had fled his Seoraphuli home, in Hooghly, after learning about the complaint.

 A number of raids were carried out to arrest him, but Mukherjee could not be traced. We had planted a source in his locality, but he did not return home even once during this period, he said.

 On Tuesday night, Gariahat thana was tipped off that Mukherjee would come to Ballygunge to meet a lawyer. We laid a trap and rounded him up, said an officer.

 He, however, pointed out that several other employees were involved in the crime. We are trying to identify and arrest them.

 Celebration of art

 Artspace India presents Baisakhi, its annual exposition of art by veteran, senior and young generation artists. A visual anthology that attempts to highlight trends in art in the new millennium, it also reveals the struggle of artists as they grapple with the substance of tradition and their individual propensity. Senior artists, including Paritosh Sen, Amitabha Banerjee, Suhas Roy, Jogen Chowdhury and Shuvaprasanna, along with their younger contemporaries Ashok Bhowmick, Samir Aich, Pradip Maitra, Atin Basak, Tapas Konar, Chhatrapati Dutta (a painting by him appears right), Dilip Mitra and others provide the foundation on which the edifice of the exhibition stands. Young generation artists amaze by the sheer abundance of their output. Deserving special mention are paintings and sculptures by Chameli Ramachandran, Manik Talukdar, Tamal Bhattacharya, Naba Kumar Maji, Partha Dasgupta, Somenath Maity, Mohammud Hussain and Kamar Alam, among a host of other inspiring and impressive works of art.

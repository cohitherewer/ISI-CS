 The seven-storeyed annexe of Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan will be unveiled on July 24, the day the hospital completes 75 years of service.

 The annexe Adhish Chandra Sinha Memorial Building will house a super-speciality paediatric unit, a state-of-the-art emergency ward, a nurses training centre and an auditorium, among other facilities.

 Around Rs 10 crore has been spent on building the annexe, which has come up on around 14 cottahs on the Sarat Bose Road premises of the hospital.

 Adhish Chandra Sinhas family has donated more than Rs 5 crore, the secretary of the hospital, Swami Sarvalokananda Maharaj, said on Tuesday.

 He said the hospital badly needed an expansion to cope with the rush of patients. It caters to more than 300,000 outdoor and over 21,000 indoor patients a year.

 Besides, we needed to install modern equipment for treating patients in a critical condition, including children. The new building will have an ultra-modern emergency unit and a super-speciality paediatric unit with surgical facilities. The 50-bed paediatric unit will be spread across the second and third floors of the annexe. The hospital already has a 70-bed paediatric unit, the secretary said.

 Bikash Sinha, the director of Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics and a brother of late Adhish Chandra Sinha, said his family has a close association with the hospital and Ramakrishna Mission in general. My brother Adhish suffered from various diseases since childhood. He always dreamt of a hospital that would cater to children. We are happy to contribute a little to this hospital, he said.

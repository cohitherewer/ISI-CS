 Course for builders

 - Initiatives to groom second generation

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Learn better to build better.

 Having been painted by the same tarred brush for long, thanks to the errant ways of a handful in the fraternity, city developers have moved to groom the second generation in a more scientific and structured manner.

 Besides the youth forum already kicked off for sons and young kin of the current active cadre, Credai Bengal, the umbrella body of city developers, has now tied up with St Xaviers College for a six-month certificate course in real estate.

 The programme for graduates has been drawn up in consultation with St Xaviers professors and will include classroom sessions as well as exposure at real estate development sites. We plan to flag off the course in August-end, Pradeep Sureka, the president of Credais Bengal chapter, tells Metro.

 The curriculum will cover issues like land use and real estate development, throwing light on areas where conflicts could arise, human habitat and the legal and statutory aspects of real estate development, accounting and taxation, project management and the like.

 The objective is to equip the students with a rudimentary knowledge on real estate-related topics. For instance, what are the responsibilities and liabilities of a developer, once a project is completed and handed over? points out Subhromoni De, the secretary-general of Credai Bengal.

 The faculty will be drawn from St Xaviers professors, senior members of Credai, architects and planners and also visiting legal experts. Students will be required to do an internship of four to six weeks at a project site to imbibe practical points.

 Real-time exposure to real estate is also the bulwark of Credais youth forum. The core principle is to prepare the next generation, which would eventually take over the reins, for the emerging needs and challenges of the real estate industry, says Rahul Todi, the managing director of Bengal Shrachi and a prime mover.

 The 20-odd members of the forum, in the age group of 19-25, meet and brainstorm to share ideas and new concepts, undertake site visits in the city and in different parts of the country, listen to discourses and attend seminars and trade fairs.

 Education trips to construction hotspots of Asia, like Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore, are also being planned.

 The main advantage is that we can learn from seniors and also become familiar with the emerging trends and best practices through our exposure trips. Also, we can request the senior Credai members to organise workshops, observes Gaurav Dugar, son of Surendra Dugar of the PS Group.

 Gaurav, along with the likes of Saket Mohta, son of former Credai Bengal secretary and Merlin Group managing director Sushil Mohta, are the young guards in whose hands lies the future skyline of Calcutta.

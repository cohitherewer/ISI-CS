The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tiffin box for bomb

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A stainless steel tiffin box inside a jute bag that lay unclaimed on a platform of the Dum Dum Metro Railway station kept officials and security personnel on tenterhooks for almost three hours on Monday. 

 A large contingent of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and members of the Calcutta police bomb squad rushed to the station. Sandbags were placed around the bag. Sniffer dogs, too, were brought in.

 Trains continued to ply from both platforms but there was panic among passengers. 

 Around 1pm, bomb squad personnel, clad in bullet-proof jackets and accompanied by the sniffer dogs, opened the tiffin box with a large crowd of passengers looking on. The box contained a meal of rice, bekti and curry.

 Around 10.25am, a Metro official alerted his seniors about the bag after it lay on the Up platform for a long time. The station authorities called in the RPF and then senior officers at Lalbazar. 

 The RPF personnel were the first to arrive. They surrounded the bag and asked passengers to move away from it. The sight of the bomb squad men and sniffer dogs on the platform caused panic among passengers. 

 The RPF men had to intervene to avoid a stampede. The situation prevailed till the tiffin box was opened. 

 It proved to be a wild goose chase. We brought the tiffin box to the police station. No one has yet claimed it, said an officer of Sinthee police station. 

 A senior Metro official noticed the jute bag lying unclaimed on the platform. He sounded an alert. The RPF men rushed to the spot. We later informed Calcutta police and the bomb squad, as the tiffin box appeared suspicious. We didnt want to take chances, explained a Metro Railway spokesperson.

 Somebody might have played a trick to scare passengers. Train services were not disrupted, despite the three-hour drama, added the spokesperson.

 Bananas for chain

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Cops at Bowbazar police station are feeding bananas to a lifter to make him part with a gold chain naturally.

 The police said Sheikh Munna had swallowed the chain immediately after snatching it from a woman in a car at the crossing of Ganesh Chandra Avenue and Chittaranjan Avenue on Friday afternoon.

 An X-ray on Munna at Medical College and Hospital revealed the chain, which weighs around 1.5 gram. Doctors advised us to keep him on purgatives, which will help wash out the chain. So, we are feeding him bananas, said a senior officer of Bowbazar police station.

 Munna snatched the chain from Sonali Paramanik, a Girish Park resident, who was on her way to Park Street to meet relatives. 

 Last month, the police station met with success after the applying the trick on Sheikh Mohasin, who had swallowed a gold necklace.

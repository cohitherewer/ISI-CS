 Goof-up charge in deaths

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Malini Sarkar 

A 31-year-old woman died on Thursday at a private nursing home after delivering a stillborn child, allegedly because the medical team had inserted the oxygen tube into her foodpipe. 

 Malini Sarkar, a resident of Bansdroni, was admitted to Eveland Nursing Home, in the Tollygunge police station area, in an advanced stage of pregnancy on April 28. Her husband Biplab, a garment trader, said Malini was under anaesthesia during the Caesarean section when the oxygen tube was inserted into the foodpipe instead of the windpipe.

 Biplab alleged that on Wednesday, his wife was taken to the operating theatre for a Caesarean section around 11 am. Soon, a nursing home official told me the baby was dead and my wife was in a critical condition. When she was under anaesthesia, the oxygen tube was inserted into her foodpipe by mistake, he said.

 Dr Rathin Ghosh, gynaecologist and owner of the nursing home, said a technical complication was responsible.

 The technical problem during the administration of anaesthesia before the surgery created hypoxia, a lack of oxygen in the tissues, he said. 

 An eminent city gynaecologist said hypoxia is caused primarily when the artificial oxygen supply to the body during anaesthesia is disrupted or the oxygen tube is mistakenly placed in the foodpipe.

 After the blunder, Malini gave birth to a stillborn baby. Her condition became critical, Dr Ghosh said. We shifted her to a nearby nursing home as she needed to be admitted to the ICCU immediately and we dont have this facility in our nursing home. Unfortunately, she died at the nursing home around 3.15 am on Thursday, he said.

 Malinis relatives and neighbours, outraged by her death, tried to ransack the nursing home, but a police team restrained them. 

 Our force brought the situation under control. A picket has been posted at the nursing home since late last night, said Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south), on Thursday.

 On Thursday morning, Malinis relatives lodged a complaint at Tollygunge police station, alleging that medical negligence had caused the deaths. We are investigating the matter, Kumar said. 

 We are questioning the people concerned and waiting for the post-mortem results, a police officer said.

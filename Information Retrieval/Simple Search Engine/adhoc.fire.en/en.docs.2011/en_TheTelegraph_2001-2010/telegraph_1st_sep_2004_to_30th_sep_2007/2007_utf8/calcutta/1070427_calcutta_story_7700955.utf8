 Paris in pictures

 As an Artist-in-Residence in France, under an Indo French cultural exchange programme organised by French Embassy in India in 2005-06, Leena Kejriwal focused on the uneventful, untouched everyday life of the people of Paris. Using photography as a medium to capture the beauty of daily life, On the Streets of Paris, her ongoing exhibition, depicts the work she had done during her residency. The photographs on show take us into the private and personal lives of Parisians behind doors and windows and, sometimes, into the back room of a caf. They introduce us to whole families, complete with aging grandparents and tiny babies, heartily tucking into an afternoon snack and enjoying themselves in the deep, red warmth of a tearoom to escape the winter chill. Hosted by The French Association, French Embassy in India and Aakriti Art Gallery.

 Event: Photographs by Leena Kejriwal When: Till April 29; 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Aakriti Art Gallery, 12/3A Hungerford Street

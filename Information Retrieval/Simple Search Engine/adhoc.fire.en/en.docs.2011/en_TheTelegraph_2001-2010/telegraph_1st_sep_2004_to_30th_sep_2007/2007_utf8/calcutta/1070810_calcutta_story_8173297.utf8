The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Car comes in Buddha way

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A car carrying a state government official suddenly came in front of the chief ministers convoy as it was entering Writers Buildings on Thursday afternoon.

 The security breach was reported around 4pm, when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was returning to the state secretariat after lunch.

 The car, hired by the government, sharply turned out of the parking lot and moved towards the state secretariat, just as traffic on the road had been stalled to make way for the chief ministers convoy.

 It was only after the car ended up ahead of the convoy, right in front of the pilot car, that the policemen posted on both sides of the road swung into action.

 The vehicle was steered towards the right and halted, while Bhattacharjees convoy, which paused momentarily, drove into Writers Buildings.

 PWD superintending engineer Kashinath Dey, who was in the car, said the driver had just arrived from Behrampore and was not accustomed to the citys traffic.

 I knew the chief ministers convoy was behind us and kept telling him to stop as he turned sharply, but I think he was too stunned to react. He has just come from Behrampore and is not aware of the rules here, Dey told the police.

 The driver was let off after a case of traffic violation was lodged against him.

 It seemed an unintentional intrusion. We have booked the driver for a minor traffic violation, said the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Gyanwant Singh.

 Officers, however, admitted that it was a serious lapse by the policemen deployed in front of the secretariat. How could they let the vehicle move when traffic on the road was closed? That such a breach could occur before Independence Day is even more worrying, said a senior officer.

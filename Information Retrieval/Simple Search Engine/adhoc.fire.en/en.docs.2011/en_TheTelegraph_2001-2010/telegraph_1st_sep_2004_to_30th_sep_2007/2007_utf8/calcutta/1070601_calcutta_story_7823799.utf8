 - Recycled for solar energy

 A city-based entrepreneur has introduced a technique of recycling waste produced by the semi-conductor industry into a basic ingredient for generation of solar power.

 Wafers made from extracted silicon and germanium can be used for making photovoltaic (PV) panels for solar energy systems, said Anupam Boral, who has started manufacturing the wafers in his Kasba factory.

 The semi-conductor industry generates a lot of waste during the production of items like integrated circuits, transistors and diodes. Silicon extracted from this waste is redone to make the wafers, said Boral.

 This is the first time such a recycling system has been introduced in the state, said S.P. Gonchowdhury, director of West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency.

 Such recycling is done in Singapore and any local initiative will help in developing renewable energy further, added Gonchowdhury.

 Used-up solar panels can also be put to good use in this recycling endeavour.

 Of the many solar panels now in use in our state, many were installed several years ago and have outlived their efficiency period. They are now dumped as toxic electronic waste, said Boral. But now we can extract the useful materials, like silicon and germanium, from the panels and re-use them.

 Moreover, as these are being made in an environment-friendly factory, there is hardly any chance of pollution, he claimed.

 The etching technique, however, is not always successful. A more effective technique, known as lapelling, can be used for producing wafers. But we are yet to have the machine that can carry out lapelling indigenously, Boral said.

 INTRUDERS IN HOUSE OF GOD: Armenian Church. A Telegraph picture

 Shrine under siege

 Shivnarayan Purohit: Armenian Church is a heritage structure. But I am surprised to note that more than 50 people have encroached upon the inner campus of the church. Is the civic body sleeping? Recently, the CMC has taken a decision to restore more than 2,000 heritage structures in the city. Have they forgotten it? 

 Armenian Church is an important heritage landmark of our city. And, therefore, its preservation is our duty. I will take up the matter with municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and request him to take steps to preserve the sanctity of the church. I will ask him to take strict steps against the encroachers.

Santosh Singh: The indigo-base paint and colour factories in the Chinabazar Street area have made our lives miserable and unhealthy. The unbearable stench of paints has given rise to diseases like respiratory disorders. The elderly and children are most vulnerable to such problems. What are you doing about it? 

 I am aware of the problems. But you are the first one to complain against the units. I would request you all to submit a mass petition before I approach the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the state pollution control board. 

Naresh Singh: There is only one CMC-run Hindi-medium primary school in the Chinabazar-Brabourne Road-Canning Street belt. There is one more school for poor children, Jain Vidyalaya. But I am shocked to learn that the teachers force the students to clean the drains and sweep classrooms and corridors. Is this humanity?

 I have written a letter mayoral council member (education) Kalyani Mitra in July, pointing out the miserable state of the school and the fate of 150 underprivileged students. They are not given mid-day meals and are being tortured by the teachers. But she didnt reply. I will send her a reminder. 

 This time, if she ignores my request, I will organise a roadblock along with the local residents. 

Santosh Singh: The Chinabazar area is more prone to malaria. I can give you examples, where all members of a single family are infected by malaria. What is the civic health department doing? 

 Well, you are responsible for the mess. I have seen puddles of water and piles of garbage in every nook and corner of the area. You should take steps to prevent malaria and please stop blaming the health agencies. 

Jaigopal Mishra: There is a serious shortage of domestic help, sweepers, washermen, cobblers, barbers and day labourers. Earlier, in the British era till 1980, these workers use to stay on campuses of the civic office, government offices and staircases of big houses. Now, they are allowed to stay there. Can you make some arrangements for them? 

 How can I manage a vacant plot in Burrabazar-Chinabazar belt? It is densely populated. You are talking about the era where rich house-owners allowed their servants to stay on the campus. Now, most of the big houses have been taken over by the promoters and builders. And they are not going to spare a single inch for you. 

B.P. Singh: Thank you for taking an initiative to resume the unfiltered water supply in the area. Why was the supply discontinued in the Chinabazar, Synagogue Street and Jackson Lane area?

 The Chinabazar area used to get its filtered water supply from Mullickghat pumping station. A small water treatment-cum- booster station project was taken up by former mayor Subrata Mukherjee at Jorabagan. The Jorabagan treatment plant got the unfiltered water supply from Mullickghat pumping station. So, the supply was discontinued. Besides, I have written to CPM parliamentarian Sudhanshu Sil to allot some funds for replacing the old pipelines. I am waiting for his response. 

Radhadevi Jain: Scarcity of water is a decade-old problem in the Old Chinabazar Street area. Can you help us out?

 You stay in a densely-populated area. Hence, when the supply is lesser than demand, there is bound to be shortage and scarcity. Besides, the age-old pipelines should be replaced for a better water flow.

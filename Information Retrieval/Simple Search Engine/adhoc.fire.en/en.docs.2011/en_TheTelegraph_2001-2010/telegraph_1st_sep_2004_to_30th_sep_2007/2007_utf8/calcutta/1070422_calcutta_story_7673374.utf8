 Big Brother and brown dogs

The soft-spoken Franck Pavloff looks an unlikely author of an Orwellian novella on the dangers of political quietism. But for the son of a Bulgarian anarchist who fled to France during the Second World War, writing is akin to a political stand. 

 In Calcutta for the launch of Khaki, the Bengali translation of his book, Matin Brun, he stresses that people have a responsibility to act for change when faced with repressive forces.

 Khaki is about the denizens of an unnamed city in a Hitlerian regime where homogenisation is the norm, where people conform to an increasingly repressive regime as the dictatorial government decides to put down all dogs not brown in colour, and arrest those who have failed to comply with it. Eventually, the order is extended to include all those who have ever owned non-brown pets.

 Pavloff, a psychologist and child rights activist, reiterates that the books worth is not in its political discourse, but in its ability to tell a story that might find echoes in our own lives.

 Written in reaction to the rise of the far right National Front in France in the 80s, the book picked up sales in the aftermath of its leader Jean Marie Le Pen picking up 18 per cent of the 2001 presidential votes, with Pavloff waiving his royalty to keep prices as low as possible. 

 But the author skirts political affiliations. It is more humanist than anti-communist, he says of the Orwellian metaphors in the novel that uses the death of animals to draw people out of their comfort zone and make them react to what they find wrong with the system. 

 My parents hoped that the horror of the war would never be repeated again. But nothing has changed.

 Chinese exotica and cycle vans

 A picture by Mala Mukherjee.

Xinjiang, once home to predominantly Muslim Turkish groups, is gradually being overrun by the Han Chinese. Mala Mukherjee was one of the 14 photographers from outside China to be recently invited to this province by the Chinese Photographic Association. Her photographs exhibited at Akar Prakar gallery show a land of flaming red forests, sparkling streams, shepherds and a people who bear a striking resemblance to Indians of the Northeast.

 Mosques with towers, red chillies drying in the sun, camels, rope bridges and colourful rugs are familiar exotica, but Mukherjee also records the cycle vans, the abundance of fruit and meat and the Mao portrait. This sets her photographs apart.

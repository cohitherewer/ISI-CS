 Branching out to beat space crunch

 In Elgin Road in 1969, at Ganganagar in 1976, at Kalyani in 1988 and now in Howrah. Its not another retail chain opening new outlets but a city school on expansion mode. Julien Day School has decided to start a branch on 11 acres in Howrah by the end of 2009. The foundation stone of the institution was laid on December 19.

 We run double-shifts in all our existing branches because of a space crunch. The new school can accommodate 245 students, said Julian Broughton, chairman, Julien Educational Trust. The Elgin Road branch, he says, is not big enough to support any extracurricular activity.

 The plan of a Howrah branch was proposed to the seven-member trust in 2005, the main criterion being accessibility. We had Howrah in mind from the beginning, said Tanmoy Bhattacharya, administrator, Julien Day group of schools. Though Calcutta has seen many new schools in the past few years, Howrah has been neglected in this respect, said Bhattacharya. 

 Howrah seemed to be the best place for us as we have around 315 students coming all the way from there to our Elgin Road branch, said Broughton. The existing three branches of Julien Day cater to 6,000 students.

 The Howrah school aims to operate higher secondary classes as well, but it will be some time before that happens. It has not been decided yet whether the branch will be affiliated to either of the Delhi boards or the Cambridge board.

 The blueprint of the Allahabad Bank-funded project will be tabled by the month-end. We are planning to start the school from April, initially till Class VI, said the chairman. In case another floor is not added to the building by April, higher classes will be held in a nearby rented building for a few months. The school also plans to provide hostel facilities, but those will be offered only when it upgrades till Class X.

 Besides academics, a structured vocational course and training in music and sports like tennis, cricket, football and basketball are on the anvil, Broughton said. He added that the vocational courses would be designed in a way so that they dont hamper studies. Moreover, I am against the culture of students taking private tuition. I want to provide complete education here, he said. 

 The star draws at the Julien Day Howrah branch will be a heritage centre with a museum open to public, and a subsidised childrens clinic on the campus. The district magistrate has promised full support from the government for these add-on facilities, said Bhattacharya.

 The new branch of the school has already received eight registrations from Howrah. That only proves the popularity of Julien Day, smiled Broughton. Shiuli Mukherjee, a parent, said: I have already registered the names of my two children. I think Julien Day will be the best bet in Howrah. Mukherjee, who stays in Ramrajatala in Howrah, thinks the school located at the crossing of Kona Expressway and Mumbai Road will be easily accessible.

 The Julien Day group is also considering setting up of a technology college in Howrah. But we cant say exactly when it will come up, said the administrator.

 The space constraint in Calcutta over the past few years has made many families shift base to the other bank of the Hooghly. Education being one of the key requirements, the satellite town is sure to benefit from the new branch of Julien Day.

 With so many international industrial projects coming up in Howrah we are encouraging reputed educational institutions to establish themselves here. The new Julien Day school is much needed, said Nandini Chakraborty, district magistrate, Howrah.

 Saddam death

 Saddam Hussein rsquo;s execution was just another opportunity for the Americans to show off their power and position to the world. It sends a warning signal to all who dare to voice their stand against Bush.

 I think that the event will make the situation in Iraq no better, instead it can take a turn for the worse. Killing one Saddam might give birth to thousands more like him. The person who deserves execution right now is Osama bin Laden.

 We knew that the execution of the former president of Iraq was a matter of time given the new political and administrative set-up in the country. 

 India was in a great dilemma on what stand it should take in the matter. Saddam had been a time-tested friend of India at times of crisis. Perhaps that is why India has always maintained a silence in the international arena and accepted the killing of the dethroned dictator without much protest.

 Throughout his life Saddam remained a controversial leader, enjoying power and popularity with one section of the population in his country and being condemned by another for his belligerent attitude and despotic lifestyle. However, we must be rational and totally unbiased in our views about him.

 The entire event of Saddam rsquo;s capture, trial and execution should serve as a valuable lesson to the world community on when and how to react to inhuman acts in any part of the world.

 Atrocities and cruelty against any human being cannot go unpunished for a long time. Hence, our fight for the right cause on any world issue must be firm with the focus remaining on humanity. Friendship comes only after that.

 Delayed justice

 Jessica Lal rsquo;s family surely got the best gift in 2006. They had been waiting for the judgement for years. With Manu Sharma being handed out the life sentence, there is much for them to rejoice. But at the same time, one should not forget that in a country where it takes a few minutes to commit a crime and seven long years for justice to be delivered, everything is not in order. There still are many like the Lal family who are awaiting justice. Our judicial system should be more efficient.

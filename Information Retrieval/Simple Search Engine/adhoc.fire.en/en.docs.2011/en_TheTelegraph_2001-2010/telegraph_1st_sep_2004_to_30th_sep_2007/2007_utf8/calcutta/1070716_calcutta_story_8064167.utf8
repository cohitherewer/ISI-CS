The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Shaun Pollock

 You are mature and experienced, and people come to you for advice. Although many may not know it, at heart you crave for adventure and fun. You are not aggressive, but you do not rest until you get what you want. The opposite sex is greatly attracted to you. Do not expect too much from others, or from yourself.

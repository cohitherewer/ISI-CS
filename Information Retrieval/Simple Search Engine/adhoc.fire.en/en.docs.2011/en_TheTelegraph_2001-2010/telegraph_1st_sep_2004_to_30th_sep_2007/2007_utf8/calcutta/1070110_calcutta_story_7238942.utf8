 An urban tragedy

 Doyens of literature, music, art, theatre and other forms of popular entertainment, come together in Swapnasuchanas latest production, Hemlat - The Prince of Garanhata. A play that takes Shakespeares Hamlet and places it in the modern context, it is a criticism of the extreme indifference and ruinous attitudes of the present generation. As in the original, the protagonists father has been murdered by his uncle, Kadu. Kadu, who now lives with Hemlats mother, Manorama, runs a catering business and is trying to sell the family home to promoters. Other residents of Garanhata are Hemlats childhood love, Shefalia, her drunkard father, Paul, the local councillor, Sukhen and a host of other characters who passively await the dawn of a new day. Events rush on to their inevitable, tragic end after the ghost of Hemlats father makes a sudden, dramatic appearance. Drama, direction and acting: Bratya Basu. Staged as part of the ongoing ninth Lok Krishti Natyotsav.

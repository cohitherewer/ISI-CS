 Kandla drown probe

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after Calcutta-based marine engineer Apurba Bhattacharyas body was flown into the city and the last rites were performed, the Kandla police claimed on Tuesday that the 41-year-old had possibly drowned and even cited post-mortem reports to justify their claim. 

 The police, however, also said there were grey areas, including the clothes in which the body was found, that demanded a probe. The police have sent a part of Bhattacharyas remains for viscera test and are waiting for the detailed post-mortem report before questioning those aboard the ship on which the engineer, whose bloated body was found on September 7 beneath berth No. 8 of Kandla Port, was supposed to be present. 

 The preliminary post-mortem suggests presence of water in the victims lungs and abdomen. It appears that he had even relieved himself in his bermudas before breathing his last, said B.L. Vave, the officer-in-charge of Kandla police station. But if Bhattacharya, a fourth officer, was on duty, we need to find out why he wasnt in uniform. Besides, we need to clarify whether Bhattacharya had left the ship, if he had returned, and if so, when. 

 The only son of Tarapada Bhattacharya, a 75-year-old railways employee, Apurba joined Indo Austria Maritime, a shipping company based in Mumbai, on August 25. Bhattacharya, the police claim, apparently boarded the ship for the first time to reach Kandla on August 28. The ship left to return on September 5. Next day, when the ship set sail from Kandla Port, the staff realised that one of the 22 members was missing. That was Apurba.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Baggage loss bane of air travel

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Pronab Sen and wife Sumitra were travelling from New York to Calcutta by British Airways (BA) on December 6. As the airlines connecting flight from New York to London was delayed, the couple missed the scheduled flight and was put on an Air-India flight.

 BA officials had promised that our luggage would reach us on time. But of the three registered bags two reached three days later and another after eight days, said Sen. Worse, a number of items including chocolates and saris were missing,

 A letter to the airline remains unanswered.

 Joydeep Mukherjee, an NRI travelling from New York to Calcutta on the same airline three days later, had a similar experience. His flights were on time, but a part of his luggage went missing.

 These are no stray cases. Bags, or items that otherwise would be carried as cabin baggage, going missing has become the bane of air travel. The reasons range from heightened security measures leading to airport chaos to fog delays to a scan-and-steal racket at terminals.

 Several cases against airlines involving loss of baggage and consignments are pending with the state consumer disputes redressal commission, said Prabir Basu of Bengal Federation of Consumer Organisations.

 British Airways apologises to all customers whose baggage has not been returned, a BA spokesperson told Metro.

 Several flights were cancelled or delayed in December because of fog. The disruptions affected the baggage belt system. A lot of baggage could not be connected from one flight to another, said an official.

 According to BA, what added to the problem was that the baggage belt at Heathrow was not working properly. We are tying hard to clear the backlog. Many of the bags have been returned to customers. Any complaints from any passenger will be investigated, the official added.

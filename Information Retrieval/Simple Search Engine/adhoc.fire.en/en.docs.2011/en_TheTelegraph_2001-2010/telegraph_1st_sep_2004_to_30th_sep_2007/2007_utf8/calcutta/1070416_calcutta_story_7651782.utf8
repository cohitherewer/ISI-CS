 Cuffed for false rob cry

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ajit Kumar Dubey, who worked in a Burrabazar-based firm, was arrested on Sunday for stealing his employers money. Police said the theft took place on Tuesday.

 What Dubey did was to spin a yarn of a theft in transit that fooled his employer, and even the cops till Sunday, when the sleuths finally managed to solve the puzzle.

 A.K. Agarwal, a cloth merchant, had handed Dubey a bag containing soiled and tattered notes totalling Rs 50,000. 

 Dubey was to deposit the amount at the Reserve Bank of India and get fresh notes in exchange. 

 On Tuesday afternoon, Dubey returned to Agarwals shop on Jamunalal Bajaj Street, looking hassled, and claimed that someone had slit the bag while he had stopped for tea and took out around Rs 20,000.

 Agarwal asked him to lodge a complaint with Burrabazar police station. 

 The officers initially believed the employees version, for he sounded convincing enough.

 A senior officer at Burrabazar police station said Dubey had foxed us into believing that someone had really cut his bag and taken out the money while he was on the way to the bank.

 But after days of probe, we realised it was a cooked-up story. Intense interrogation forced Dubey to admit to the crime. The entire amount was recovered from his house in Liluah, Howrah, the officer added.

 The notes were neatly tucked under the mattress of his bed and we have managed to recover them all, said the officer.

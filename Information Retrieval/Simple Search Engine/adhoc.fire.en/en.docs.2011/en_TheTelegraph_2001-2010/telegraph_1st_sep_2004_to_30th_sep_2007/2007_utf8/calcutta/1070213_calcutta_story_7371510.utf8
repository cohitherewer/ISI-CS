 Six weeks have passed since the conditional access system (CAS) made a formal entry into cable homes in parts of Calcutta, but the roll-out has been far from perfect. 

 According to cable television industry sources, CAS that lets the viewer choose and pay for only the channels he or she opts for has hit a technology roadblock. 

 To make the system functional, the multi-system operators (MSOs) are required to instal a software, called subscriber management system, at their ends to identify subscribers by unique codes assigned to each one of them. 

 But the software is not working, as the MSOs do not have the technology to encrypt the digital pay channel signals at their end, explained an industry insider. 

 So, the MSOs and local cable operators are giving pay channels free to the 44,000 subscribers, of the three lakh cable homes in the CAS Phase I area, who have purchased set top boxes (STBs). 

 The subscribers have been asked only to pay Rs 77 for the free-to-air channels that are being aired through our network, said a cable operator of New Alipore. 

 Competition from direct to home (DTH) players has also come in the way of CAS implementation. 

 People are switching to DTH As a result, both the MSOs and the cablewallahs are providing the pay channels free to hold on to their subscriber base, explained an industry insider. 

 But Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) chairman Nripendra Mishra sounded confident of the effective launch of CAS by the month-end. 

 Digital signals have not yet been encrypted and it needs to be done as soon as possible. All the MSOs have promised to get the system in place by February 28. Stringent measures will be taken against those who are trying to sabotage CAS, warned Mishra.

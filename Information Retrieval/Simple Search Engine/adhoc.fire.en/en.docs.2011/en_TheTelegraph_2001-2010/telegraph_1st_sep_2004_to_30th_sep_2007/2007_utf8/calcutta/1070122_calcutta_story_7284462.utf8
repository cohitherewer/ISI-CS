 What: 

 Inauguration of Sandhyatara, the food junction at Star Theatre.

 Where: Star Theatre on Bidhan Sarani.

 When: Saturday evening, 6.30 pm.

 Take a look: After the success of a month-long food festival at the rooftop, the newly revamped Star Theatre is ready with a range of permanent food stalls that have transformed the patio into an open-air food court. 

 Tollywoods leading man Prosenjit, flanked by local MLA Sadhan Pande and his daughter Shreya, were present to inaugurate the food court amidst a shower of confetti and a flash of fireworks. I started my professional career at Star Theatre with my first stage show Samadhan, so there is always a feeling of nostalgia associated with it. To have a food court at Star Theatre is a great idea, especially for people living in the north who dont have the pleasure of such entertainment in this area. Also, youngsters will have another place to hang out and enjoy, smiled Prosenjit. 

 The food court has eight stalls serving a wide spread of heavy and light snacks and beverages. There is a Cha Adda that serves a variety of tea and coffee. Next to it stands Garam Masala that serves momos, rolls and fries. A food plaza with patties, pizzas and pastries also boasts of a Hukka Bar. 

 Apart from the rolls, cutlets and pakoras, Arambaghs Adda Bites in the corner has a separate seating arrangement that serves Thai, Chinese and continental food along with sundaes and mocktails. An assortment of jams, jellies, squash and munchies are also available at one of the stalls. Theatregoers and youngsters can unwind on the dimly-lit steps of the food court, which will be open from noon to midnight on all days. 

 Pocket pinch: Dishes range from Rs 10 to Rs 110. 

 Voiceover: Were focusing on youngsters and couples who need a comfortable adda zone to relax. We plan to organise musical evenings, mime shows and karaoke in future to attract more people, said Arijit Dutta of Priya Entertainment Pvt Ltd.

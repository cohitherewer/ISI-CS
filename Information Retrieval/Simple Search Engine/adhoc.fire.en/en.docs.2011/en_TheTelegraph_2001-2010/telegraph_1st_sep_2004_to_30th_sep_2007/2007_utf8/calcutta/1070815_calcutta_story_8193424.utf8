 A bus full of school-going children mowed down a couple on EM Bypass on Tuesday morning. Anutosh Majumdar, 46, and his wife Madhumita, 30, were on their way to work when their motorcycle hit a pothole, lost control and ended up under the wheels of the schoolbus. The couple has a 10-month-old daughter.

 Anutosh, who was with the Subsidiary Intelligence Branch under the Union home ministry, was going to drop Madhumita to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, where she was a nurse in the endoscopy department. They were residents of Ashwini Park, in Baguiati.

 Like any other weekday, the two had left home at 9.30am after depositing little Anwesha with Anutoshs parents in their flat in the same building.

 They took the slip road towards Salt Lake that connects VIP Road with EM Bypass. The accident occurred as soon they hit the Bypass, heading towards Apollo hospital.

 The accident took place just after 10am. Their two-wheeler hit a pothole and lost control. The bus carrying children to Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, in Salt Lake, ran over the motorcycle, which got wedged under it, said a police officer.

 The driver of the bus fled the mishap spot, while the children were escorted to school by police and residents of the area.

 Witnesses from Duttabad blamed the tragedy on the poor condition of the road, post-rains, and the chaotic crossroad.

 An accident was waiting to happen at this point. The traffic lights do not function properly and theres a traffic free-for-all, said Parbati Banerjee. By the time we rushed to the spot, the man had died and there was no hope of saving the woman.

 Madhumitas sister Moumita was in a state of shock. I cannot believe it, she mumbled, waiting for the post-mortem to get over at NRS Hospital where her sister and brother-in-law had been declared brought dead when wheeled in after the mishap.

 Every morning before leaving for work, Anutosh and Madhumita would leave their daughter with his parents. This morning, Madhumita told me, My daughter hates getting up in the morning, I wonder how she will ever go to school. An hour later, I heard of this tragedy, recounted neighbour Hirak Dutta, while waiting at NRS.

 Madhumita had joined Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals in October 2005 after completing a nursing degree course under the West Bengal Nursing Council. Her duty schedule was 10am to 6pm and husband Anutosh would drop her off every morning.

 Laxmi Bhattacharya, the nursing superintendent of the hospital, said: We are all in a state of shock. She was so sincere and gentle. She handled her patients with great care.

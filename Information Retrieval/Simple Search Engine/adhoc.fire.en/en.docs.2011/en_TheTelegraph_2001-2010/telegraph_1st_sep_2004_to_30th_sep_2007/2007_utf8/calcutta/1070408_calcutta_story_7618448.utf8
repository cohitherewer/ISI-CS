The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Roads 

 Stat Talk 

 Statistics do reveal facts sometimes. Lets take the roads of Calcutta. According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), roads occupy only 6 per cent of the city area. A 2002 CMDA study claims it is a touch over 7 per cent.

 A few wards seem to have no roads, like ward 24 in central Calcutta, with roadspace amounting to 2.4 per cent. Dhapa in eastern Calcutta scores highest 19 per cent.

 In CMCs own estimate, Calcuttas requirement was at least 16 per cent, even four years ago, to accommodate its one million vehicles. The number during peak hours has increased at least another 300,000 in the city since then.

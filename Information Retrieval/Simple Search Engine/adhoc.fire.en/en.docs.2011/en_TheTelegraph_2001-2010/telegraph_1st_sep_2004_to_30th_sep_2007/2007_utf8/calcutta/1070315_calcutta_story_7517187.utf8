 Police pass hawker buck

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A day after the mayor came up with a plan to put the onus on police to clear encroachment on footpaths, the cops claimed that such a move would only add to the chaos on the roads. 

 Traffic police officers also questioned why they should do the civic bodys work. 

 There has to be a political consensus to ensure that hawkers dont encroach on pavements and roads. The civic body decided to allow hawkers to set up shop. It is now asking police to evict the hawkers. Who will take responsibility of the lawlessness that will prevail? asked a senior officer of the traffic department.

 The cops carried out raids on select roads on Wednesday to ensure that there were no illegally-parked cars and encroachments. 

 At a meeting of the civic committee on hawkers on Tuesday, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation top brass had stressed the need to rein in the illegal traders. 

 I will speak to the police commissioner to work out a policy making sergeants responsible for keeping footpaths encroachment-free, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had said after the meeting. 

 Police officers pointed out that the civic body had allowed hawkers to settle on several important roads even at the cost of affecting traffic flow.

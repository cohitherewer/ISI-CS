 Stories in motion

 The art of story-telling started as an ancient narrative technique, with court poets, priests and minstrels describing details of momentous, historical events orally at royal or public gatherings. Before the method of documenting events in writing came into practice, history, heritage and culture were passed down from generation to generation through performances of poetry, songs, street-theatres and jatras about folklore and legends at temples and village shows, kathakars performances at royal courts or through religious and ritualistic folk dance traditions. These oral traditions tell us about societies and practices in bygone eras, glorious achievements of kings and heroes down the ages, historical events of great importance and also stories in our epics and legends. This time-honoured oral tradition comes alive once again this evening in The Art of Story Telling, reliving ancient narrative styles in all their excitement and splendour. Participants: Kathak dancer Jayant Kastaur, stage artiste Lushin Dubey, veteran thespian-director Usha Ganguli, painter Suvaprasanna and choreographer-dancer Priti Patel, among others.

 Event: Story-telling session through folk and modern art forms When: Today at 7 pm Where: The Palladian Lounge, Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry

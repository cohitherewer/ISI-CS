 Drive against slum fires

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The spurt in the number of slum fires has prompted the fire brigade to launch an awareness campaign.

 The project, a part of the Fire Service Week events, was inaugurated at a club on Chawlpatty Road in Beleghata by state fire service minister Pratim Chatterjee and local legislator Rupa Bagchi on Wednesday evening.

 Twenty-one fires had broken out in the city slums over the past five years, according to state fire services director Gopal Bhattacharya. There are more than 4,500 registered slums in Calcutta. Most of them are prone to fire. 

 The awareness programme will teach slum-dwellers how to prevent fires, operate extinguishers and help firemen in case of a blaze, said divisional officer Bibhas Guha.

 He pointed out that slum-dwellers often store combustible material. Besides, bamboo and polythene sheets, which aid the spread of fire, are generally used to construct roofs of shanties.

 According to Guha, firemen often face problems in handling slum fires due to interference by residents. They often take away the hose to sprinkle water on the fire by themselves, he added.

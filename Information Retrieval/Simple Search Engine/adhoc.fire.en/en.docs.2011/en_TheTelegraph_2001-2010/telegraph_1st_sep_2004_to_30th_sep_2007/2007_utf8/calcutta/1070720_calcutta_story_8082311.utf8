The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Harass cry against cab

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A complaint was lodged against a taxi driver with Tollygunge police station on Thursday by Shagufta Hanaphie and Rajiv Lodha, accusing him of harassing them near the Rashbehari Avenue crossing.

 Lodha and Hanaphie, who own a public relations consultancy firm at Hazra, boarded the taxi at Lords crossing on Prince Anwar Shah Road, off Lake Gardens. According to the complaint, the taxi meter was giving faulty readings, which the driver was not ready to accept. 

 At the Rashbehari crossing, the driver started to abuse the passengers. When they protested, he pushed them out and fled.

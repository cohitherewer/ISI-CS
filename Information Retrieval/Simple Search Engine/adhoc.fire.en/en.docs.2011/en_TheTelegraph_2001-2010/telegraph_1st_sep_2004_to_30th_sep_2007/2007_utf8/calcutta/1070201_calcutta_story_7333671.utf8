 Winter off, viral on

 - Humidity, foul air amp; smog blamed

 SANJAY MANDAL

 As winter bids adieu, cases of viral fever and viral gastroenteritis are being reported from across the city. According to doctors, children and the aged are more prone to the ailments.

 The most common symptoms of viral fever are throat infection, joint pain, headache and respiratory disorders, while viral gastroenteritis causes loose motion and stomach ache.

 The infections are seasonal, caused by fluctuating temperature, humidity, air pollution and smog, explains Subrata Maitra, a city-based critical care expert.

 There are many viruses that cause flu. The influenza virus is one, Maitra adds. The present weather condition and pollution help spread the viruses and one should take precaution in advance.

 Normally, the fever lasts three to four days. In extreme cases, it might stretch for 10 to 12 days.

 Patients are coming to us with pneumonia, rhinitis (inflammation of the lining of the nasal passage), tonsillitis and throat and chest infections, says Milan Chetri, consultant, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.

 According to Chetri, those suffering from chronic bronchitis, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis are more vulnerable to the seasonal infections.

 There is no specific treatment for such infections. Paracetamol and anti-allergics help to some extent. Occasionally, antibiotics are required to treat underlying bacterial infections, Maitra points out.

 As for prevention, Chetri says: Influenza is not totally preventive, but vaccines can be administered to certain patients.

 There is also a sharp increase in number of viral gastroenteritis cases. Loose motion (with or without blood), vomiting, abdominal cramps and fever, along with fatigue, are the common symptoms. Urinary discharge of a patient should be monitored carefully. A low output is an indication of dehydration, says Mahesh Goenka, consultant gastroenterologist, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. 

 A patient with such symptoms should be given oral fluids and in extreme cases, intra-venous fluid should be administered.

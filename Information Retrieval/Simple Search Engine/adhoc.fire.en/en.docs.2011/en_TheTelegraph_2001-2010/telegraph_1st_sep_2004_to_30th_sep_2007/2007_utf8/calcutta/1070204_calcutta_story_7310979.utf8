 Two bars are not enough

More power to balle balle The Punjabi joie de vivre is set for more overflow. Calcutta Punjab Club Limited has got a lawn bar, is working on a food court and planning to build another bar inside the clubhouse.

 The management launched the lawn bar on Lohri, one of the biggest events on the clubs social calendar. A great spot to catch a quick snack or drink after a swim, is how new president Sanjay Lamba describes the bar. People lounged around on the strewn manjis, rubbed their hands in front of the bonfire, tried a puff of hookah and grabbed a glass of their favourite spirit.

 All this while a Punjabi troupe belted out folk songs to the 1,000-plus members of the evening. The event was in association with Seagrams and the lawn bar saw a great response on the first day itself, says Lamba.

The 67-year-old club at 21 Ballygunge Circular Road will enhance its wine-and-dine facilities. Theres Jharokha, a 35-seater north Indian restaurant, and The Golden Room, run by Astor. Coming up is a food court on the lawn. The club is midway through the construction of the food court, which is expected to open in a weeks time. The snack joint will have four counters, out of which two will go to the regular caterers.

 And there are a lot of Punjabis out there who dont want to appear with a chicken leg in one hand and a glass of beer in another. One of the counters will cater to vegetarians. An ice-cream corner will complete the spread.

 But two bars dont seem enough for the members from the land of bhangra palle who cant do without their evening dose of rum or whisky (thats if you can drag the fun-loving lot out of the packed card room at the club).

 The Calcutta Punjab Club management is on the verge of finalising plans with the architects to build a third bar where the Maharaja Lounge now stands.

 Every club has a couple of bars. We have two now, but the bar on the ground floor is outdated. We need a change, he explains.

 The 50-seater new bar promises to be a trendy place to hang out. A blend of the old and new, it will revolve around the idea of a pub. It should bring in the youngsters as much as the elderly, says Lamba. 

 A regular Business Lounge Bar was built on the first floor a year ago, which serves some of the finest wines and the best Scotch. There was a need for a bar with an informal atmosphere. The highlight of the new bar will be marble and stone and no visible woodwork.

 Further plans include a childrens zone on the lawn and renovation of residential rooms on the third floor. The club is keen to improve its service. Experts from hotel management institutes will be brought in to brief the staff on cleanliness and table etiquette.

 Even waiters will sport new liveries, replete with gloves. Time to wash hands of the old and guzzle down the new!

 War, memories and emotions

 One of Frances most distinguished and highly-acclaimed directors, the films of Alain Resnais have always challenged the boundaries and our assumptions of what cinema should be about, perhaps more successfully than any other director. His most famous films use innovative techniques that explore the subjectivity of memory in dealing with past violence and horrors. Hosted by The French Association, a retrospective of the films of Resnais is being featured every Tuesday this month, beginning today. To be screened this evening is Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959; a still from the film appears right), Resnais first full-length feature film. It is a romantic drama about a young Frenchwoman appearing in an anti-war film in the rubble and reconstruction of the city of Hiroshima. Her brief, unstable affair with a Japanese architect brings to light the political and cultural tensions that underlie even their most personal experiences and memories. With its masterly and sometimes revolutionary use of editing and camerawork, blended with a metaphorical story and highly-figurative, spare dialogue, the film creates a stunningly powerful and poetic evocation of time and memory.

 lEvent: A retrospective of the films of Alain Resnais lWhen: Today at 6 pm lWhere: The French Association library

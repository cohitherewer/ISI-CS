 The civic headquarters building, more than 150 years old, will soon be restored to its original design.

 As part of the plan, the third floor of the building, or at least a part of it, will be demolished. Officials said the floor was constructed in the Seventies, marring the architectural grandeur of the edifice.

 Conservation architect Partha Ranjan Das, looking after the development of the BBD Bag area as a heritage zone, will assist the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in the Rs 2-crore project to restore the architecture of the SN Banerjee Road landmark.

 The blueprint is being prepared and will be submitted to the mayor and the municipal commissioner by the last week of August, Das said.

 A similar drive was carried out two years ago, when the Accountant-Generals office, off Kiron Shankar Roy Road, was restored to its original design at a cost of Rs 4 crore.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, however, pointed out that the plans success depends on rationalisation of the use of space at the headquarters.

 The third floor houses several departments including building, revenue, estate and accounts. Unless these departments are relocated to other parts of the building, we cannot pull down the floor, he said.

 We can ill-afford the wastage of space in the building. I dont see any problem in creating space for the third-floor departments on the other floors, the mayor asserted.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay pointed out that when a cottah in the city is worth more than a kg of gold, space utilisation at the civic headquarters is only 60 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 First US school in August

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 The first American School in the city will open its doors in August, US consul-general Henry Jardine announced on Friday. Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai already have American Schools.

 The school will offer a niche educational programme following American methods. It will initially be housed on the premises of the US consulate and comprise five to 10 expatriate students. Only elementary classes will be held initially.

 Admissions will be restricted to children with foreign passports, landed immigration status or permission from the ministry of external affairs because of restrictions imposed by the central government. We would be happy to offer American education to the broadest range of children, but must abide by the rules, said Jardine.

 The school will fill a niche not catered to by the existing range of excellent educational choices The school will not compete with any other institution. It will complement the work of other organisations, he added.

 Jardine also explained the motivation behind the establishment of the school. For many multinational corporations seeking to invest in India, the kind of education available for the children of expatriate families can be a deciding factor. We wanted to be ahead of the curve, rather than experience a sudden rush for American education in eastern India.

 One of the first teachers will be the US consul-generals wife, Kathleen Dickinson Jardine, a licensed elementary school teacher. She outlined the philosophy of the education that the American School students will be receiving. The approach will be student-centred. We will focus on engaging the student and try to foster cooperative learning.

 She disclosed that there would be an Indian touch to the education offered. One of our subjects will be Indian Studies. We will look into different aspects of the Indian culture. There will be field trips and other measures to make the children feel integrated to some degree with the community, Kathleen said.

 Robert Hetzel, director of American Embassy School, New Delhi, voiced his support for the school via a video link from New Delhi. The establishment of American School in Calcutta reflects the increasing business that foreign companies want to do in the city. It is yet another indicator of a shining India, Hetzel said.

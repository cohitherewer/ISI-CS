The high courts intervention saved the Maidan from getting mauled this year, but the Book Fair organisers are re-training their guns on the greens for the fairs next edition.

 The Publishers and Booksellers Guild is now considering the area around Shahid Minar and the open space opposite Eden Gardens. 

 We need an area measuring around 22 to 25 acres and the plot has to be square, so that the stalls can be arranged in a definite pattern. Besides, people should have easy access to the site and there should be space for book-lovers to stroll around, said a Guild insider on why the organisers keep coming back to the Maidan. 

 The Guilds return to the greens hinges on two factors. First, the chosen area for the fair does not fall in zones where no activity is allowed, as per the court order. These are the Red zone (off Victoria Memorial) or the Blue zone (Book Fairs venue till last year).

 The second boost is that the Guild has the blessings of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 We would not like to comment on it right now But it is clear that seven acres in Salt Lake stadium is not enough for the fair. The chief minister has assured us a proper venue and we are hopeful, says Tridib Chatterjee, general secretary of the Guild. 

 Bhattacharjee had a meeting with the Guild top brass on Sunday evening, where next years venue was discussed. 

 Following the fuss over fairs on the Maidan, the government set a deadline to make the first phase of Milon Mela ready before next winter. 

 But it seems the Guild officials are not even considering the EM Bypass venue. 

 The two plots, adjoining Phase I of the fairground, are are locked in litigation Then, there is the issue of encroachment. It will take time, pointed out Chatterjee. 

 According to legal experts, the Guild can technically hold the fair on the Maidan if the army, custodian of the greens, gives the go-ahead. 

 But the biggest stumbling block will be the green activists, who forced the fair to shift from the Maidan. We will legally oppose any such move, asserted environment activist Subhas Dutta. 

 According to him, the area opposite Eden Gardens is the playing ground for budding cricketers in winter and a fair will disrupt the game. 

 Besides, there are pollution issues. There is less grass there and so the level of pollution is bound to be much higher, added Dutta.

 Market doll-up for plaza debut

 A STAFF REPORTER

 New Market will get a much-needed renovation, thanks to the scheduled commissioning of a parking plaza-cum-commercial complex under Lindsay Street.

 A fresh coat of paint and restoration of the damaged ornamental parts of the heritage structure thrown open on January 1, 1874 are the key highlights of the Rs 1-crore renovation plan.

 Work will be executed by Mackintosh Burn, which had built the market based on the design by Sir John Stuart Hogg. 

 Funds for the makeover have been allotted, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. A shabby New Market cannot be the backdrop for the hi-tech parking hub or the new pedestrian plaza on Lindsay Street. Hence, the decision to renovate the building, he explained.

 The LASER-guided and e-governed parking facility, built by the civic body and Simplex Projects Ltd, is scheduled to be unveiled by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Friday.

 The partners have decided to celebrate the commissioning of the project by organising a three-day photography exhibition, starting April 20, and screening a documentary on the emergence, growth, decadence and renovation of New Market. The docufilm has been directed by Tapas Sengupta.

 The venue of the exhibition is yet to be finalised, said B.K. Mundra, chairman and managing director of Simplex.

 The Bengal Chamber of Commerce auditorium, Town Hall and Chaplin Park are among the possible venues, said a Simplex official. 

 The company will bear the expenses.

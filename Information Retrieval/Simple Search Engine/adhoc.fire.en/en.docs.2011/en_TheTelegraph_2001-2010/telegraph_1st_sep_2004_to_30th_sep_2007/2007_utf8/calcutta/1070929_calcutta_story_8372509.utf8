The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Save Memorial, shift bus terminus

 - High court verdict in fight against car fumes

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 To save the Victoria Memorial, relocate the Esplanade bus terminus.

 Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered the state government to remove the bus terminus in the heart of the city to a distant location within six months to protect the century-old monument from pollution.

 The verdict followed reports by the Pune-based National Environment Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and a 13-member expert committee appointed by the high court to suggest ways to fight pollution around the monument.

 We accept the recommendation of the experts that the Esplanade bus terminus be shifted to a distant place. The shifting must be done within six months from today, said the division bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice Rudrendra Nath Banerjee.

 The bench also vetoed, on environmental grounds, a Rs 40-crore proposal of the London-based Calcutta Tercentenary Trust to build a three-storeyed building on the Memorial premises to house an exhibition-cum-symposium centre. The idea is contrary to the concept of protection of the historical monument, the judges observed.

 The bench also wants the memorial office to be shifted from the campus and ordered planting of trees on the roads around the marble monument to lessen air pollution caused by vehicular traffic.

 The court, however, did not impose any restriction on morning-walkers. But visitors, including morning-walkers, will not be allowed to enter the compound with any articles. They have to deposit them with the gatekeepers, the bench ruled.

 The court directed the city police to ban parking of cars on the roads around the Memorial. The authorities are free to collect a fine of Rs 100 from those found guilty of disturbing the environmental condition of the area, the order said.

 We accept the recommendation of Neeri that the Memorial should stop lifting ground water and, instead, start rainwater harvesting to meet its requirements, the bench said. It also stressed the need to repair the roof of the monument and install a damp-proof system.

 The court directed the departments concerned to ensure that hotels and restaurants near the Memorial use clean fuels. In an earlier interim order, the bench had directed the government not to issue any permits for opening hotels and restaurants in the area.

 Fridays order was the last in a series of 64 rulings on the Memorial that followed a petition by environment activist Subhas Dutta in June 2002.

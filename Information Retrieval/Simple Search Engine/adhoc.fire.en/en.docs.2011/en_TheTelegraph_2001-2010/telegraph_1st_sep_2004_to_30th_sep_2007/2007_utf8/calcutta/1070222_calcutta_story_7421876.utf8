 The state public works department (PWD) fears that the laying of a fifth underground water pipeline from Tallah to Palta will damage BT Road and lead to severe disruption of traffic on the busy artery linking the city with its northern suburbs.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has drawn up a Rs 500-crore scheme under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission to lay the five-ft-diameter pipeline.

 Officials in the civic water supply department said the much-needed overhaul of the existing four pipelines under BT Road would be taken up once the new conduit is operational. A thorough repair of the pipelines had been put off on several occasions to stave off a drinking water crisis across the city.

 A PWD official said: Only last year, we spent around Rs 20 crore to repair the entire stretch of BT Road. Work for laying the fifth pipeline will not only lead to traffic congestion in several parts in north Calcutta, but also damage the road badly. We may have to invest the entire amount once again, said PWD chief engineer S.K. Das.

 The CMC, however, is confident that the project will be executed smoothly, with minimum disturbance to traffic and damage to the road.

 Chief engineer in the water supply department Bibhash Maity said: We, too, are concerned about the possible fallout of the project. So, we have decided to opt for an expensive method, called the trench-less technique.

 Under this method, around 200 metres will be dug up in every kilometre of the road to lay the pipeline. This will help minimise traffic congestion as well as the damage to the road.

 The CMC has used the technique to lay a water pipeline from Durgapur Bridge to Victoria Memorial Hall without causing any disturbance to the traffic on AJC Bose Road.

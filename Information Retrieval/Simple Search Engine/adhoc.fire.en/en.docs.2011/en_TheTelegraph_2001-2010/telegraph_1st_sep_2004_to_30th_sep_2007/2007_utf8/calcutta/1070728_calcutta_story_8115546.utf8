 For better teachers, a method

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A two-day workshop for teachers to help them improve their interaction with students got under way in the city on Friday. 

 Akshar, an inclusive school affiliated to the ICSE board, and ITC has organised the event at Regency Convention Centre, on Hungerford Street.

 Principals and teachers of 15 schools from across the city, like Birla High, Delhi Public School, Loreto House, La Martiniere for Boys, Modern High for Girls, Future Foundation and Apeejay, are attending the workshop.

 The event, facilitated by the Teacher Foundation of Bangalore, deals with Jenny Mosleys Whole School Quality Circle Time, a model that nurtures self-esteem, emotional intelligence and teamwork skills among students and teachers.

 The method has been successfully applied in other cities, said N. Singh, the executive director of Akshar.

 Through this initiative, we will be able to learn about new methodologies of teaching, said Reena Mukherjee, a coordinator of Future Foundation School.

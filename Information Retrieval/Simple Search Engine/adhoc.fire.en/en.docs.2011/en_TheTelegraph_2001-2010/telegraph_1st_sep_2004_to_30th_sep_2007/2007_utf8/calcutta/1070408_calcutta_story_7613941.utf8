The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Poet on the tiger trail 

 Ruth Padel does not look her 60 years. It is six in the morning and Padel has had a hectic schedule. A cancelled flight at Bhubaneswar had also cancelled her plans of a reading from her travelogue Tigers in Red Weather in the city the day before. 

 Padel, dressed in a pair of crumpled cotton trousers, a chunky necklace, blue eyeliner over tired eyes, and a ready smile, is a poet who spent three years on the trail of the tiger in Asia. She is also the fourth generation descendant of Charles Darwin and takes things in her stride, much like her predecessor who braved a hard voyage to the South Pacific islands. I havent been bitten as much by leeches, or bothered by ticks, as real conservationists, she remarks. 

 Seeing a tiger is like falling in love, she remarks, recalling her first sighting of a tiger at the Kanha forest reserve in Madhya Pradesh. It happens only if you are lucky. Does her preoccupation with tigers not fit the prototype of the jaded Western tourist searching for the East? Most people in the West dont give a damn about what happens to tigers here. They are more concerned about which mobile phone to get.

 She put in four years of hard work tramping the jungles of Asia into the travelogue. 

 India is at a tipping point in conservation, she says. When I was working for the book, there were still tigers in Sariska. It is frightening to think that India might very soon be a land of the imaginary tiger.

 I found it hard going back to British society, she recalls. In the jungle, I was living life as it really is, away from the masks of civilisation.

 Her next book will bring her to India again. It is about Manasa, the snake goddess, in whom she developed an interest while working in India.

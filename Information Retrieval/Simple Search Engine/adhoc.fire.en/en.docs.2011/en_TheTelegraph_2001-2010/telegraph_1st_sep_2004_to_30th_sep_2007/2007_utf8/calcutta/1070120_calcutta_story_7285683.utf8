 Bus turns turtle on Bypass, two killed

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two persons were killed and six seriously injured on Friday morning when a small chartered bus, carrying office-bound passengers, overturned on the EM Bypass.

 The bus driver was trying to avoid a cyclist who had suddenly come in the way of the speeding vehicle.

 Of the two victims, Manik Surya, 22, was the drivers help. The other was the cyclist. They were taken to NRS Medical College, where doctors failed to save the two.

 Some of the injured were rushed to Ruby Hospital. The bus driver managed to flee. 

 The accident took place around 9.55 am on the Bypass and slowed down office-hour traffic near the Science City roundabout for an hour.

 The driver was speeding down the Bypass, headed south, when a cyclist suddenly cut into his path. As he slammed the brakes and swerved at high speed, the bus toppled over and fell on its left side. The cyclist and the help were trapped under the bus, said a senior officer of Sealdah Traffic Guard.

 The bus was so badly damaged that the cops had to tow it to Parama Investigating Centre to make way for traffic.

 Investigations revealed that the bus was one of the citys 500-plus contract carriages that ferry either schoolchildren or office-goers. Many of them speed down congested routes to meet their deadlines and squeeze in as many trips as possible.

 When the twain meet

 Two classical dance forms, Odissi and Manipuri, are interwoven in Mohanam, a choreographic presentation portraying the theme of love. The similarities and differences between the two forms are retained and revealed through its solo performances. Champu (the classical style of singing in praise of Lord Krishna and Radha in Odissi) and Ras (the Manipuri style of singing and dancing) have been exploited to their fullest through compositions enriched with spiritual expressions of the sentiments of Radha and Krishna. Gotipua (male dancers of Orissa who performed in temples) and Pung (Manipuri mridanga performed as invocation during Raslila) artistes capture the mood of the presentation through pulsating performances that captivate the attention of the viewers. Choreography and direction: Suman Sarawgi and Piyali De.

 Event: Dance presentation based on Manipuri 

 and Odissi classical forms When: Today 

 at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, 

 IB-201 Salt Lake

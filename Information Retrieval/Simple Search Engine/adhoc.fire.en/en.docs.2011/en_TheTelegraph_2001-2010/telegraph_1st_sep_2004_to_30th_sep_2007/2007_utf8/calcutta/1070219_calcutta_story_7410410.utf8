 The City Diary

 Traffic was disrupted on EM Bypass and in parts of Salt 

 Lake on Sunday afternoon and evening, following a huge turnout 

 at the Book Fair and the Mohun Bagan-Dempo football match, 

 both at Yuva Bharati Krirangan. The chaos forced the convoy 

 of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who returned 

 from New Delhi late in the evening, to take the New Town 

 bypass on way to the city. 

 With the crowd spilling over from the barricaded footpath 

 on to the Bypass, vehicular movement was disrupted on Narkeldanga 

 Main Road and Beleghata Main Road. Several visitors had 

 to park their cars on roads leading to Salt Lake, as the 

 car park at Subhas Sarobar was chock-a-block. 

 Two persons were killed in road accidents in the city on 

 Sunday. A 50-year-old woman was knocked down by a private 

 bus on Mahatma Gandhi Road, near Chhabighar cinema, around 

 1.45 pm. She was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, 

 where she died. 

 In the other mishap, a man in his mid-20s was hit by a 

 private bus on the western slope of Narkeldanga bridge. 

 He was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where 

 he died. 

 An Alliance Air craft had to be grounded at Calcutta airport 

 on Sunday, following a drop in the cabin pressure. The plane 

 first took off for Dimapur at 10.25 am, but had to return 

 at 11.03 am. 

 Later, it made another attempt to leave for Tezpur and 

 Jorhat, but failed. An airline official said some passengers 

 were put on another flight, while the rest will leave for 

 their destinations on Monday. 

 A huge quantity of smuggled items, including Chinese-made mosquito nets, were seized on the Darjeeling Mail at Sealdah station on Sunday. The raid on the train followed a tip-off.

 More than 400 students from 45 city schools have been selected for the state-level final of the 9th Science Olympiad, to be held in New Delhi. The students are from Class III to XII. The selection followed a test at Future Campus School, in Sonarpur, on Sunday.

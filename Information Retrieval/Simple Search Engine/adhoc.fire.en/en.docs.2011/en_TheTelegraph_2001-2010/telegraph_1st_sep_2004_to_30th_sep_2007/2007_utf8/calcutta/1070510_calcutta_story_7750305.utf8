 After the Earth-like planet, the massive stellar explosion reported by American astronomers on Monday will find a place in the shows at MP Birla Planetarium.

 The planetarium authorities are collecting information about the cosmic phenomenon, believed to be the most powerful explosion observed from the Earth, so that it can be incorporated in the shows.

 We have always tried to inform people about important celestial events. This time, too, we will make arrangements to spread awareness, said Debiprosad Duari, director (research and academics) of MP Birla Planetarium.

 The planetarium incorporated information about an Earth-like planet in its shows soon after the planet was discovered.

 We have started gathering information about the stellar explosion. We will also try to assess the interest of the people in the phenomenon. Our programme will explain the complicated theory of stellar evolution in simple terms, Duari added.

 The explosion took place 240 million years ago. We are seeing it now because the stars are located 240 million light years away. It took 240 million years for the light to travel to the Earth. The explosion cannot be seen by the naked eye, explained Duari.

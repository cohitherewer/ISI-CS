The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 When PK is the art muse

 Caleidoscope

 Bemused: P.K. Banerjee in his home. A Telegraph picture

 Pradip Kumar Banerjee, alias PK, the affable, friendly and voluble father-figure of the Maidan, is known for many feats. The erstwhile dashing forward with bullet-like shots and accurate heading is also known to shoot verbal volleys about the state of Indian football now especially.

 To him is attributed interesting flourishes of language apparently he once described the football, cutting through the field like a banana. He will also be remembered as a formidable coach. But PK as a form of art? 

 The footballer has inspired something not many of his Indian colleagues have to their credit an art exhibition. Three artists, Narayan Bharadwaj, Sayanti Ghosh and Bimal Acharya, are displaying their works at an exhibition on PK organised by the Bengal Young Sports Journalists Association at GC Laha Centenary Fine Arts Gallery, Laha Paint House, CR Avenue, from June 23 to June 30. Called Life and Time of Padamsree (sic) Pradip Kumar Banerjee, it will presumably show PK on the canvas in many moods. What is extremely confusing, however, is the information at the bottom of the card. It says: Lubricants are: Washim R Kapoor. 

 Er, is Mr Kapoor some kind of a football accessory? The artists were steadily unavailable on phone on Saturday. 

 Mirror on the net

 This is for all of you down and out and out of place in a nightclub, all of you who suffer shocks of inferiority complex out there on the dance floor. (Warning: This is going to be a bit of a spoiler). 

 On the Calcutta Underground (the nightclub) Club community on Orkut a post says: Prettiest girl in Underground. It goes on to say: Shes so pretty you wont believe it. The curious soul of course goes and clicks on the link. However, what s/he sees is not the girl who had set the nightclub on fire the night before, but his/her own mugshot. Because the link directly leads to the homepage of whoever is clicking on the link. Old trick, but makes you feel good. 

 Into a crock

 Wheres the river now: A freshwater Indian crocodile 

 The crew of a French ship had a strange experience after the infamous Calcutta storm on September 30, 1737.

 The ship had survived the evening winds, but it bulged after being driven ashore near Kidderpore, its crew shaken and exhausted. The delivery was to be made at the French outpost at Chandernagore, but seeing the devastation around the storm had destroyed 20,000 ships, sloops and boats harboured near Calcutta, reported The Gentlemans Magazine in June 1738 the captain ordered the bales of merchandise to be taken out. 

 A sailor was sent down to fling out the bales from the ships hold. But suddenly, he ceased working. The captain sent down another but heard no response from him as well. The impatient captain yelled and cursed and sent the best and the toughest of his sailors to fetch them by their collars. But the tough joined the other two in the mysterious silence of the hold.

 The French sailors, who had survived oceans and the storm, felt a fear crawling up their skins. They lit torches and huddled in a group to descend into the hold, which was nearly filled with water. To their great surprise, they saw a huge crocodile staring at them and twitching, as if expecting more prey. It had come in through a yawning hole in the ships side, and made a meal of their three companions. 

 The future history of the crocodile is yet to be known.

 Van mows down 3 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Road mishaps claimed three lives and left two people injured a student and a constable in Howrah and Calcutta on Friday.

 The three killed were mowed down by a Matador on Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Road, in Howrah, around 12.10 am on Friday.

 The victims Ramnaresh Singh, 35, Ramnarayan Singh, 55, and Joystna Maity, 45 worked in a roadside eatery. Another worker of the outlet, 17-year-old Bablu Singh, was admitted to Howrah district hospital in a critical condition after being hit by the vehicle.

 The Matador (WB 25-2158) ran over the workers while they were cooking on the footpath. The driver, who was allegedly drunk, fled after the accident.

 Shop-owners and residents of the area rushed the four to the hospital. Doctors pronounced three of them dead.

 The Matador did not even have its headlights on in the darkness of the night. It boarded the footpath and ran over the four, said owner of the eatery Dharampal Bedi, who witnessed the mishap.

 In the city, Rudra Prasad Jana, a student of Class VIII of Nava Nalanda school, on Southern Avenue, was injured after being hit by a car on Prince Anwar Shah Road in the morning. 

 Jana was admitted to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan.

 Constable Noor Alam, 35, was injured after being hit by a Hyundai Santro in front of Akashvani Bhavan at 11.30 am. He was walking to work.

 The vehicle was impounded and the driver arrested. Alam was treated at Medical College and Hospital and discharged.

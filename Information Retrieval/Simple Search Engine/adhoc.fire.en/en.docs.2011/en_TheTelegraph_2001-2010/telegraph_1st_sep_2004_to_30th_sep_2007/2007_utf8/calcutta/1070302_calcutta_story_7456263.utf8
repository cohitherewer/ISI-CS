 Pranab Roy

 Former Ranji player and national selector

 Sourav Ganguly was a better player between 1996 and 2005. Whenever he crossed 40 or 50 during his golden period, he would convert that into big scores. That is why he has as many as 22 centuries in One Day Internationals. His consistency level has deteriorated now. The reason is progressing age. This is true of all the senior players including Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar. It will be unfair to expect the same performance from them in this World Cup as in 2003. If Sourav is back in the side, a big reason is that no young talent has come up in the last few months. But even at this age, Sourav is a far better player than any of them.

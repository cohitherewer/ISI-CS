 Student freeze to ease CU workload

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University (CU) has decided to reduce student intake in the undergraduate courses to cut down on the workload of holding the graduation examinations.

 The university will prevent colleges affiliated to it from admitting students beyond capacity, especially in the honours courses. Moreover, the CU authorities are considering a proposal to bar colleges from offering new courses.

 Some colleges have criticised the move. The authorities of these colleges feel that with the number of students appearing for the higher secondary and equivalent examinations on the way up, CU should explore options of accommodating more students at the undergraduate level.

 The workload of the university is increasing, with a steady rise in the student strength of the affiliated colleges. There is a space problem in accommodating undergraduate examinees. Hence, we have directed the colleges to strictly abide by the regulations while admitting students, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Suranjan Das said on Tuesday.

 According to the university statute, colleges cannot enrol more than 150 students in a section. In some colleges, there are more than 350 students in a section.

 Last year, the university had sent circulars to the colleges, asking the authorities not to admit students beyond capacity. But after receipt of registration applications from undergraduate students last month, the university officials realised that most of the colleges had not paid heed to the circulars.

 Increased enrolments in the colleges have forced the university authorities to hold the BA, B.Sc and B.Com examinations in the most popular subjects in a staggered way.

 We have explained our problems to the colleges several times. But they are not following the regulations. The university will now take action against colleges that violate the admission rules, stated an official.

 We have to reduce the undergraduate examination workload. Research and postgraduate education will suffer if the university has to focus on conducting undergraduate examinations, observed Das.

 Asutosh College principal Debabrata Chaudhury countered: The number of undergraduate applicants to the university is increasing every year. Reducing enrolment is not a permanent solution. Grant of autonomy to colleges and distribution of the workload by setting up universities in North and South 24-Parganas may be considered.

...and what it is up against

Screen On amp; Off

 After the Wedding (Denmark): 

 When Jacob, the head of an Indian(!) orphanage, returns 

 to Copenhagen at the request of a potential benefactor, 

 he is persuaded by the man to attend his daughters wedding. 

 There, he meets the donors wife, Helene, an encounter which 

 takes him back to his past. This is the seventh Oscar nomination 

 for Denmark, and the only familiar face in the cast is Mads 

 Mikkelsen, who played the baddie Le Chiffre in Casino 

 Royale.

 Days of Glory (Algeria): 

 For the North African troops fighting for France during 

 World War II, their experience in uniform becomes a painful 

 lesson in just how little regard their colonial rulers have 

 for their humanity. This is the fourth nomination for Algeria, 

 which had one in 1969, for what turned out to be the shortest 

 winning Oscar title Z.

 The lives of others (Germany): 

 In East Berlin in 1984, the secret police organisation, 

 Stasi, conducts extensive surveillance operations against 

 any East German citizen suspected of opposing the Communist 

 regime. But when Captain Gerd Weisler begins monitoring 

 the daily life of the playwright Georg Dreyman, he finds 

 himself increasingly unwilling to betray his subjects private 

 moments. This is the seventh Oscar nomination for Germany 

 since 1990.

 Pans Labyrinth (Mexico): 

 In the violent period following the Spanish Civil War, a 

 young girl captivated by a fairy tale comes to believe she 

 is the lost princess of the story. In the wake of her mothers 

 remarriage to a cruel fascist officer, young Ofelia explores 

 a vast stone labyrinth, where she encounters the faun Pan 

 and is given three tasks to perform. This is the seventh 

 Oscar nomination for Mexico. The country is yet to win the 

 Best Foreign Film honour.

 Focus on India as global power

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE 

 From the pros and cons of capital account convertibility for Indian economy to the bottlenecks facing agriculture in Bengal the local and global policy issues came to the centre stage during the two-day annual conference of the Bangiya Arthaniti Parishad at Lady Brabourne College. 

 We are facing several economic and social problems We thought that it would be ideal to know what economists think on these issues, said state finance minister Asim Dasgupta at the inaugural session on Saturday. 

 Speakers included JNU vice-chancellor B.B. Bhattacharya, economist Mihir Rakshit and sociologist Andre Beteille. Students, professors and industry representatives also participated. Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi was present at the meet.

 In his address, vice-chancellor Bhattacharya spoke about India as a global economic power and the advantage that its economy has in reaping the benefits of globalisation. Our failure in controlling the population has turned into an advantage. We have the largest young workforce. The other advantage is our highly-skilled technical workforce.

 Beteille, former sociology professor in Delhi School of Economics, delivered the first AK Dasgupta memorial lecture and discussed the contemporary and pertinent issue of classes and communities.

 The curtains on the conference came down on Sunday, with a discussion on rural development and approach to the 11th Five Year Plan.

 Bangiya Arthaniti Parishad was set up to facilitate discussions on economics and has been associated with promoting the study of economics in this part of the country.

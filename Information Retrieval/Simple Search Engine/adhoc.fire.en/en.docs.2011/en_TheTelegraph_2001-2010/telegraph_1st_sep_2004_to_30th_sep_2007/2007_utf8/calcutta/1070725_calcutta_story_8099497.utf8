 Thread of continuity

 Art has the power to reach out to people, cutting across geographical borders and breaking through barriers set by culture, idiom and language. What makes art truly global is, perhaps, a thread of continuity that links one generation to the next. Nexus, the ongoing group exhibition of paintings, offers a glimpse into this ubiquitous quality of art, highlighting common streams of concern and consciousness among artists of succeeding generations. Revealing their own distinctive styles, the eight participating artists aspire to their cognition of truth in their own way. Displaying pure and uninhibited freedom in their use of colours and composition, the paintings on show appeal to the finer senses, striking a chord of understanding in the hearts of even the ordinary viewer. Participants: Bijan Chowdhury, Debabrata Chakrabarti, Dipti Chakrabarti, Prabal Roy, Rupchand Kundu, Subrata Chowdhury, Subrata Gangopadhyay and Subrata Pal (a painting by him appears right).

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by eminent artists When: Till July 29; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 108 Southern Avenue

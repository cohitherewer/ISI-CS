 Custody for clinic worker

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sheikh Ashraf Ali, arrested on the charge of molesting a woman in a city nursing home on Thursday, two days after she had given birth, was produced in Bankshal court on Friday.

 The accused supervised the ayahs in the nursing home on Bhupen Bose Avenue, in Shyambazar, for the past three years. He entered the womans cabin and tried to touch her.

 Ashraf was arrested late on Thursday on the basis of a complaint by the woman. He was remanded in judicial custody on Friday, said Anil Kar, the officer-in-charge of Shyampukur police station. 

 Ashraf sneaked into the cabin around 6pm. He asked the ayah in the room to leave, said an officer on the case.

 Nursing home employees told the police that Ashraf used to sneak into womens cabins frequently. Some of the employees had objected to his behaviour but he didnt care. They even alerted the nursing home authorities, but no action was taken, added the officer.

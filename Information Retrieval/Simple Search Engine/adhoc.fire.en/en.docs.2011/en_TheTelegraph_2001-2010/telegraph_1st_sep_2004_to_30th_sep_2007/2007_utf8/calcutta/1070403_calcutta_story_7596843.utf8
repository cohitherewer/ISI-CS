 Behind the silver screen

 Showcasing contemporary Indian photography in an attempt to promote its appreciation among the audience as an active art form, Tasveer, Opening Season brings together a series of exhibitions featuring works by some of the most prominent lensmen of our time. Silver Screen, the ongoing exhibition of photographs by Fawzan Hussain, brings alive several interesting dimensions of Mumbais bustling film industry. Offering an outsiders perspective of the world of gloss, glitter and glamour, it also takes a close, critical look at the industry, highlighting the ironies and contradictions in the lives of those who sell us dreams to make their living. Presenting a fascinating panorama of impressive sets and locations, directors, actors, aspiring stars, technicians, as well as the excited, motley crowd that waits to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars, the images try to make sense of the world of fantasy and illusion that exists beyond the silver screen.

 Event: An exhibition of photographs by Fawzan Hussain When: Till April 8; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

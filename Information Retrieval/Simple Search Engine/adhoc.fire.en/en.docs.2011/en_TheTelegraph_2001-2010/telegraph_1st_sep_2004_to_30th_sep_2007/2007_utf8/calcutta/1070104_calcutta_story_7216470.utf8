 The open courtyard of Khelat Ghoshs residence in Pathuriaghata, surrounded by massive white pillars, will come alive with the sound of music for three days from January 5. 

 The house will be the venue for the All-Bengal Music Conference, featuring artistes of vocal and instrumental music and dance.

 The music conference was revived in 2005 after a gap of 52 years and is being held in association with Jalsaghar. The first All-Bengal Music Conference was inaugurated by Rabindranath Tagore at Senate Hall in 1934; the soiree hosted Faiyaz Khan and Allauddin Khan. The conference continued till 1953 and there were 13 sessions during this period. 

 We wanted to retain the old-world ambience of a musical soiree and so have been holding the conference at the Pathuriaghata house for the past two years. The courtyard can seat an audience of around 500, said Rabin Paul, spokesperson for All-Bengal Music Conference. 

 The inaugural evening features a shehnai recital by Daya Shankar, sarod by Tejendra Narayan with Subhankar Banerjee on the tabla, a vocal recital by Suchisree Roy and kathak by Madhumita Roy. 

 January 6 will be a nightlong affair, featuring thumri and dadra by Savita Devi, kheyal by Manjusha Patil and Sandipan Samajpati, sarod by Basant Kabra with Tanmoy Bose on the tabla, Odissi by Sujata Mahapatra and sitar by Budhaditya Mukherjee. The final evening is reserved for violin by Milind Raykar and kheyal by Jayateerth Mevundi.

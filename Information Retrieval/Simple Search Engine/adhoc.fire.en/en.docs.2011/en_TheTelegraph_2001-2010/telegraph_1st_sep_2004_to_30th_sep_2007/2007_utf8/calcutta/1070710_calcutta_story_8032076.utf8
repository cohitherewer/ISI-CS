 School framework for science study

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government will come up with an institutional framework to ensure students get adequate opportunities for in-depth study of science.

 The framework will be developed by the department of science and technology, which wants to improve the quality of teaching in schools by upgrading the skills of the teachers and setting up well-equipped laboratories.

 The thought of having an institutional framework occurred in our minds when we came across the problems faced by science students in both government schools and elsewhere. The problem is forcing an increasing number of students to opt for non-science streams in the Plus II level, said Pawan Agarwal, the secretary in the department of science and technology.

 As part of the framework, the government will take help of science museums in the city to set up well-equipped laboratories with low-cost gadgets in schools.

 The museums will help schools arrange low-cost experimental devices. They will also organise scientific shows for students, said Jayanta Sthanapati, the director of Birla Industrial and Technological Museum. 

 Last month, he attended a meeting to formulate ways to implement the framework across the state. The director-general of the National Council of Science Museums and the directors of various science museums were among the others present.

 At the initial stage, 10 schools in a particular area will be identified, where the framework will be implemented. Teachers will be responsible for steering the programme in their schools. The programme will also include schools in the districts, where the standard of science teaching has declined because of lack of infrastructure, Agarwal said.

 Science need to be taught through demonstration of the topics, he said. But the teachers are helpless, as most schools do not have the facilities for practical classes.

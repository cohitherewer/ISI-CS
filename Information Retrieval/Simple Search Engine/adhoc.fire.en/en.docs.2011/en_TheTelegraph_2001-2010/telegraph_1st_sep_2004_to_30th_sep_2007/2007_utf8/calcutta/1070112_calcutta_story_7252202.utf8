The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 An angel in 

 the studio

 Screen On amp; Off

 This Sunday, taking 

 the hot seat in Inside the Actors Studio on PIX is 

 the charming Drew Barrymore (in picture). Having come 

 a long way since her big-screen break in Steven Spielbergs 

 sci-fi classic, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Barrymore 

 is today not only a bankable actress but a producer in her 

 own right.

 Despite a troubled and much-publicised 

 adolescence during which she appeared in only a handful 

 of films, Barrymore was officially on the rise during the 

 1990s with notable roles in Poison Ivy, Everyone 

 Says I Love You, Never Been Kissed, Charlies 

 Angels and most recently 50 First Dates.

 On the show, Barrymore shares 

 a lot of her little-known secrets. A half-Hungarian from 

 her mothers side, the actress never actually finished high 

 school. Barrymore was also the youngest person ever to host 

 Saturday Night Live, being just seven when she took 

 the famous chair.

 The best part of the chat this 

 Sunday is when Barrymore reveals how her godfather Spielberg 

 gave her a quilt for her birthday with a note Cover yourself 

 up. Enclosed was a copy of the January 1995 issue of Playboy 

 for which she had posed nude, with the pictures altered 

 by Spielbergs art department so that she appeared fully 

 clothed!

 Barrymore believed in doing everything 

 early in her life. In 1990, she published an autobiography 

 titled Little Girl Lost and she was only 14 at the 

 time of completion of the book.

 So, catch the exciting episode 

 of Inside the Actors Studio this Sunday at 7 pm on 

 PIX. Friday, finally

 On Thursday, Adlabs Films announced 

 the acquisition of worldwide distribution rights of Anurag 

 Kashyaps Black Friday which revolves around the 

 1993 Bombay bomb blasts. The film will now be releasing 

 worldwide on February 9.

 The film was banned two years 

 ago by the Bombay High Court in the week it was slated to 

 release. A petition filed by a group of the 1993 bomb blast 

 accused had challenged the release of the film until the 

 special TADA court delivered its judgment on the case. The 

 judgment was delivered on September 12, 2006 and now Black 

 Friday can hit the theatres on a Friday.

 Produced by Arindam Mitra and 

 directed by Anurag Kashyap, the film features Kay Kay Menon, 

 Pavan Malhotra and Aditya Srivastava playing Inspector Rakesh 

 Maria, Tiger Memon and police informer Badshah Khan.

 Screened in competition at the 

 Locarno Film Festival in 2004, Black Friday subsequently 

 travelled to festivals in Germany, Estonia, South Korea 

 and the United States.

 Elaborating on the announcement, 

 Sunir Kheterpal, COO of Film Distribution, Adlabs Films, 

 said: Black Friday is a bold and brave story that 

 is waiting to be told to the Indian public. Against 

 cancer

 A new CNN show, Saving Your 

 Life (Saturday at 12.30 pm and 8.30 pm) promises to 

 provide answers on cancer. In a powerful hour of informative 

 and inspirational conversation, CNNs chief medical correspondent 

 Dr Sanjay Gupta and Tour de France champion and cancer survivor 

 Lance Armstrong join forces to discuss the killer disease. 

 Also joining Saving Your Life 

 are renowned cancer experts Dr Harold Freeman, associate 

 director of the US National Cancer Institute and medical 

 director of the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and 

 Prevention, and Dr Jim Hotz, an expert on rural healthcare 

 and cancer whose story inspired the movie Doc Hollywood.

 The biggest moment of hope on 

 the show is the look at Armstrongs MRI images revealing 

 the two large tumours and the presence of the man on the 

 show.

 As Gupta says, this is an exclusive 

 opportunity to hear from some of the most distinguished 

 members of the medical community about their advice on how 

 to avoid and beat cancer. Its a testament to those survivors 

 who can offer first-hand advice that can save lives.

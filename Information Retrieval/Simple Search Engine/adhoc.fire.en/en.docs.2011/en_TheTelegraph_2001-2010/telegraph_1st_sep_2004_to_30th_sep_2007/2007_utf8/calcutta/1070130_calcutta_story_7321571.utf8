 Held for dowry torture

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Kunwar Sukhjiv Singh, an engineer with a private airline, was arrested at his residence at Kendriya Vihar, near the airport, on Saturday last for allegedly torturing his wife for dowry.

 The arrest followed a complaint by the wife, Ramandip Kaur Dhindsa. 

 We received a complaint from Ramandip on Friday that she was physically assaulted by husband Kunwar Sukhjiv Singh for dowry, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 According to Ramandip, her in-laws had been behaving badly with her ever since her marriage six years ago. Encouraged by his parents behaviour, my husband used to beat me up regularly, Ramandip said.

 She alleged that after she sought help from police, Sukhjiv proposed to pay her a hefty sum for maintenance.

 Ramandip, who used to work in a private firm, was allegedly forced by Sukhjivs family to quit her job. She was asked to stay at home and do the daily chores, an uncle of Ramandip said over the phone from Chandigarh.

 The situation went out of control in October, after which police arranged a counselling session for the couple. Sukhjiv and his family had assured us that they would not behave badly with Ramandip. But the woman lodged a second complaint, on January 26, and we had to arrest Sukhjiv, said an officer of Rajarhat thana.

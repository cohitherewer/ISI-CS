 Look, no schoolbag! Two years after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) started its campaign against heavy schoolbags in lower classes, board chairman Ashok Ganguly will inaugurate on Friday a separate building at BD Memorial Institute, in Pratapgarh, near Narendrapur, aimed at de-stressing junior students, physically and mentally.

 During the three-day celebrations, commencing on Friday to mark the occasion, principals of different CBSE-affiliated schools in Calcutta will meet to discuss vanishing values and broken bones, a discussion based on a notice circulated by the board in September 2004.

 The board had tried to draw attention to the urgency of providing a stress-free education to the students in the primary sections of the schools. The notice, signed by G. Balasubramanian, director (academic), reads: One of the major contributors to the stress is the size of the schoolbag... The board has always felt that the number of books and notebooks prescribed for (junior) students should be as minimal as possible. Even these books and notebooks have to be left in the school classrooms so that the students do not have to carry (them) home.

 According to Manjula Chakraborty, senior English teacher at BD Memorial Institute, the new building will host over 1,000 students from pre-primary till Class V, and there will be no burden of books or homework. This is in line with principal Usha Mehtas vision of no bags, no aching shoulders, following the board notification.

 The celebrations are part of our annual festival Eduvision and the new building will be meant for a play-way method of teaching, Chakraborty said. Kids will learn the fun way and grow without inhibitions.

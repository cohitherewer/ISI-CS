 On August 13, Renewable Energy Club of Heritage Institute Of Technology went on a field trip to the WBREDA complex (West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency) in Salt Lake. The excursion comprised club members from the biotechnology and chemical engineering departments. The students got insight into non-conventional energy resources being used today. 

 Amitava Sen, superintendent engineer and T.K. Hazra, additional director, WBREDA, the nodal agency of MNRE (Ministry of New and Renewable Energy) explained the procedure for operating the power plants and spoke about projects in the pipeline. 

 Not many knew about the solar photovoltaic plant at Sagar Island, the 2MW power plant using wind energy at Frasergunj, the rice husk/diesel dual power plant at Bankura and Birbhum, and the biogas micro turbine at Purulia. All of these are under West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency. 

 From there the students proceeded to Rabi Rashmi Abasan, the first solar housing complex in the country at Rajarhat where WBREDA has set up a solar plant. Utpal Saraswati, the consulting engineer, explained the architectural techniques that will be used to keep the area air-conditioned through the year.

The objective of the project was to prevent frequent collision, said the duo, students of Class XII in Jharkhand, who had worked on the project for three years. 

 A deep insight of pure science was observed in all the exhibits commented Parthasarathi Majumdar. 

 The host school won first prize in the industry and environment category with a project on Low cost green solution to water pollution (picture by Anindya Shankar Ray). It aimed to provide an alternative approach to the removal of arsenic in drinking water.

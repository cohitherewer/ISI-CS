 Bus claims boy, truck another

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Racing buses claimed yet another young life in the city, while a truck crushed under its wheels a child on the southern fringes on Tuesday.

 An unidentified boy, aged around 14, was knocked down by a private bus racing against another on Sundari Mohan Avenue, in Beniapukur, around 1.45pm. Bystanders took him to National Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead.

 He was crossing the road when the bus hit him. Witnesses said the driver, who fled, was overtaking another bus when he hit the boy, said a police officer.

 In the other accident, six-year-old Bejoy Mollah, a Class II student, was run over by a speeding truck in Sonarpur. Local residents caught hold of the driver and beat him up, but he later managed to escape.

 Bejoy, a resident of Jadavpur, had gone to his maternal uncles house in Sonarpur to visit a fair. 

 He was playing with his cousins outside the house when we heard a commotion. Coming out, we saw Bejoy lying on the road, soaked in blood. We took him to hospital, where he died, said father Rahaman Mollah.

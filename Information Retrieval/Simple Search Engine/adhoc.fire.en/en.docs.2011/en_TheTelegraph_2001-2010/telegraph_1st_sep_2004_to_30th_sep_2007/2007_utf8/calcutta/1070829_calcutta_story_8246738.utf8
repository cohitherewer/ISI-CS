 A study in psychology

 To be screened this evening as part of Bergman Evenings with Samik Bandyopadhyay, the ongoing initiative by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts featuring 11 of Ingmar Bergmans varied works, is Persona (1966; a still from the film appears left). Arguably Bergmans most challenging and experimental film, it uses minimal composition and extremely tight close-ups to illustrate the theme of psychological deconstruction. It offers an intensely provocative, highly cerebral and artistically complex depiction of human frailty, cruelty and identity. In its portrayals of celebrity stage actress Elisabeth Vogler and Sister Alma, the young nurse assigned to care for her, the film never attempts to define who a person actually is, but the different identities, or facades, that the two women project. The themes of experience, children and romantic relationships take on very different meanings for the two of them. Alma seems to covet what Elisabeth has, but she has deliberately chosen a different path. The film illustrates how different, and yet similar, the two women are ... and how cruel and destructive the human will can be.

 Event: Film show as part of a retrospective of the works of Ingmar Bergman When: Today at 6 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

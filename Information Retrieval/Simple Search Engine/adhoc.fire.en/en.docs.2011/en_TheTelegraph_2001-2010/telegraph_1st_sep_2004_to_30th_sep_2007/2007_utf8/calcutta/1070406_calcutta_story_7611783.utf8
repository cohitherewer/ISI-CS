 The only person left alive to throw light on the abortion-linked family carnage in Howrah added another tragic chapter on Thursday that of a mother killing her daughter, to end her agony.

 Sutapa Bag wife of gynaecologist Jayanta Bag told her sister Madhumita Dolui that she had throttled her nine-year-old daughter Tiyasa early on Wednesday to put her out of pain.

 The 35-year-old doctor was driven to murder and suicide at his Andul home after a gang of four beat him up on Tuesday night for photographing women who had gone to him for abortions.

 Bag slit the throats of his wife and daughter with a surgical blade, before taking his own life. Sutapa, the lone survivor, is recuperating in hospital.

 She told her sister that she could not bear to see Tiyasa bleeding and crying in pain after Jayanta slit her throat. So, she strangled her to death, said an officer in Jagachha police station.

 After meeting her sister in hospital, Madhumita came to the police station and told us about the confession. We have initiated an attempt to murder case against Sutapa, he added.

 A team of forensic experts visited the Bags Andul home and collected blood samples, glass shards, some syringes and ampoules. The forensic experts also questioned Sumanta, the doctors brother. 

 They wanted me to confirm my brothers handwriting in the suicide note, said Sumanta, also a resident of Andul.

 In the suicide note, Jayanta blamed the gang of four for his death. He also admitted to clicking pictures of his patients. 

 We are looking for the four men, but they are absconding, said Milan Kanta Das, additional superintendent of police (Howrah Town). He, however, refused to divulge their names. 

 Everyone knows the four that the doctor has mentioned in the note. But we will have to live here and we do not want to take chances, said a neighbour of Jayanta. 

 An uneasy calm prevailed in the area and no one wanted to speak about Wednesdays incident. We had seen young men and women coming to his house at odd hours Now we know why, said a neighbour.

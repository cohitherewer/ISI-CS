The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 HC deadline for market shift

 - Civic body directed to provide amenities

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The high court has set January 31 as the deadline for the College Street market traders to relocate to Marcus Square. 

 The court also directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to provide shop-owners the necessary facilities at the park. Justice Soumitra Pal passed the order on Thursday in connection with a suit filed by a group of traders from the market.

 In an earlier judgment, Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta had allowed reconstruction of the market by shifting the traders. The order paved the way for a multi-crore reconstruction and redevelopment project. 

 The scheme is a joint venture of the CMC and Bengal Shelter Housing Development. 

 The College Market Dealers Association later wrote to Left Front chairman Biman Bose, secretary of the partys Calcutta district committee Raghunath Kushari and local MP Sudhanshu Sil, drawing attention to their plight.

 Work is on at Marcus Square and power supply, water supply and drainage facilities will be in place soon, promised joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam.

 The mayor had set January 15 as the deadline for the 1,254 traders of the market to temporarily shift their business base to Marcus Square. 

 The CPM Calcutta district committee leadership and the mayoral council members feel that the shift can be effected only after the amenities are in place at the park. 

 The traders came to me and I tried to negotiate on their behalf. The dealers association later went to court, said Sil.

 The mayor should set a date for our return, asserted the association president Dinesh Kumar Jaiswal.

 Why should landlords discuss redevelopment schemes with their tenants? countered mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharayya.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Held before mart raid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five armed members of a gang were rounded up in Ballygunge by a team of officers from Karaya police station late on Monday, while they were planning to break into Haldiram Food Mart.

 The five Sheikh Anwar, Firoz Khan, Rahamat Hussain, Mohammad Wasim and Mohammad Kalam were wanted for extortion and violence in Topsia, Tiljala and Karaya. 

 They were preparing to raid the food mart when we tracked them down and arrested them. We found 14 live cartridges on them, said a senior officer of Karaya police station.

 The officers also recovered six single-shotters and one six-chamber gun from the men.

 One of the gang members Shiekh Anwar, alias Mona is a notorious extortionist, said the officer. He had fired at his rival Kana Dom, a few yards from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees house on Palm Avenue, in December 2004.

 The five were produced in court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody. Most of the gang members, in their mid-20s, have been involved in crime for the past five years, said police. 

 Kalam and Hussain have been extorting businessmen in and around Topsia and Tiljala, said another officer.

 Hussain had been arrested earlier in connection with a dacoity. We are interrogating them to find out how they came to possess the arms, the officer added.

 Investigation revealed that some other members of the gang have taken shelter across parts of South 24-Parganas, including Bakrahat and Lakshmikantapur. A hunt is on for the absconding gang members.

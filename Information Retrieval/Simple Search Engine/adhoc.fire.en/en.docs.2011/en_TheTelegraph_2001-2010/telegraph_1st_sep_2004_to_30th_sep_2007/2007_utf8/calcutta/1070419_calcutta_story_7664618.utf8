 The biggest casualties of a natural disaster are women, said Rahul Bose. He knows better for he was actively involved in post-tsunami relief work in the Andamans and witnessed what the disaster had done to women.

 The actor was speaking on gender equality and communal harmony at a session organised by the the Ladies Study Group at a city hotel on Tuesday 

 The interactive session was marked by a no-holds-barred discussion on the condition of women in both urban and rural areas and how they are often subjected to molestation and gender injustice.

 Social change, justice or improvement cannot happen overnight. The idea is to work at it gradually. We will never have a gender-equal world if men do not agree to it. The only way is to slip it to them and then associate some kind of machismo with it, said Bose.

 What should follow is a concerted attempt to empower young girls by educating them.

 The discussion identified barriers faced by a girl since her birth. Most of those present at the programme felt that any attempt at lifting the barrier should include subtle and gradual redefining of the concept of machismo.

 A long-term solution to the problem lies in honing the sensitivity of your sons by involving them in art, painting and acting, the actor felt.

 His advise to girls: Whenever you face any trouble, seek help from family members and seniors to deflect it.

 The communal angle, too, came into the discussion. The world is incredibly violent to women and if youre female and a Dalit, its worse. Why should you suffer oppression just because you are from a minority community? asked Bose.

 In Mr and Mrs Iyer, Rahul had played the role of a Muslim who had to assume a Hindu identity to save himself from a bunch of marauding fundamentalists.

 The audience raised several probing questions Does the presence of a celebrity help or harm a cause? Why are the majority of people in the room men? Why do women fear? Who is the nurturer and who is the hunter?

 Our aim is to create awareness among our 400 members on gender equality. Rahul is a passionate speaker on the issue and and believes in the cause, said Mallika Varma, of the Ladies Study Group.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Hue and cry over a hug

 Does the action of the Dhoni fan at Eden Gardens bring a smile or a frown to your face ?

 Star power: Dhoni 

 C. Chakroborty,

 Rishra 

 The Dhoni incident makes me frown because Dhoni is not even a star. He flopped in the World Cup. The Sheuli incident just gave him cheap publicity and I suspect it was intentional. 

 Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 Such acts of frenzied love cannot be encouraged. Fans can send cards, flowers or emails but such public display of affection is quite embarrassing, no matter how big the star is. The media has hyped the incident while the girl just wanted to earn her 15 seconds of fame.

 D. Mukherji, 

 Behala

 It is quite common that a die-hard fan like Sheuli will go to any extent to express her love for her hero. But what is so unusual about it?

 S. Chakrabarty,

 Unique Park

 The Dhoni episode is only possible in a city like Calcutta, where people are crazy for any sport, be it cricket, football or hockey. It was a light-hearted incident and should be taken in the right spirit.

 Pankaj Bhatia,

 Loudon Street

 Dhoni deserves such publicity. Sheulis action was quite daring. It is amazing how she managed to break Dhonis security cordon.

 Manasi Chakraborty,

 Address not given

 Dhoni is a rising cricket star and Sheulis behaviour was quite understandable. I feel she is quite immature. 

 Bratini Shome,

 Behala 

 The episode at Eden Gardens is really funny. But it gets embarrassing when you see it played out on TV through the day. I feel all young fans will do the same if given the chance.

 Suranjan Banerjee,

 Parnasree Pally

 Cricketers are all-time favourites with girls. But in our time, no girl would have had the pluck. Todays generation is young and restless. Sheulis behaviour should be ignored, considering her age.

 Sourish Mishra, 

 Salt Lake

 Such conduct was not expected from an Indian girl. Youngsters should respect the freedom they are given. But it is unfortunate that the media blew the incident out of proportion. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia

 The action of the Dhoni fan made me laugh for hours. This is sheer madness and immaturity on Sheulis part.

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur 

 The incident shows how todays youth can go to any length for publicity. It is embarrassing how she hugged Dhoni in front of all the TV channels.

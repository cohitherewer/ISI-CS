 The next time Beni Santoso comes a-calling at Writers Buildings, he will find it difficult to park his Merc.

 The Laldighi parking lot of the state secretariat will be shut for two years for work on an underground parking lot.

 The traffic police and the PWD are looking for sites to accommodate the 400-odd government and visitors cars that are now parked at Laldighi.

 At a meeting chaired by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb at Writers Buildings on Friday morning, the PWD and the traffic police listed four nearby sites where the vehicles can be parked. Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, PWD chief engineer P.K. Deb and deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim were among those who attended the brainstorming session.

 The alternative parking spots suggested include sites near Lyons Range (the stock exchange building), the south-east corner of Laldighi (next to Telephone Bhavan) and opposite the General Post Office.

 Weve been trying to find alternative parking spots for the past month. We are also planning to carve out parking space on the pavement opposite Writers, said Shamim. 

 A final decision will be taken by the first week of June, when the digging of the existing parking lot will start. Initially, there will not be a problem, since the digging will take place in phases, added Shamim.

 The PWD is currently reinstalling the statues that have been moved from Laldighi.

 It is difficult to find space in the existing parking lot at Writers. With Laldighi being closed for two years, our job will become more difficult, said a senior PWD officer.

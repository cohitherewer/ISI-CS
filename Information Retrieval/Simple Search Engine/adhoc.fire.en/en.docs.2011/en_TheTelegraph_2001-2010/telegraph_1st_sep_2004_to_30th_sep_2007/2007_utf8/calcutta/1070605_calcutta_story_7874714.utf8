 The 24-year-old wife of a Burrabazar businessman was found dead on the pavement outside their home on Chittaranjan Avenue, in Jorasanko, on Monday morning.

 Manisha Bajorias in-laws claimed that she had fallen off the balcony of their second-floor flat with her 21-month-old daughter. She had been married for three years.

 Poonam, the daughter, had some bruises on her legs but did not need even first-aid, said police. Manisha, on the other hand, had multiple fractures on her arms and legs. 

 Her husband Gopal, a salt supplier, and his parents who also live in the flat informed Jorasanko police station three hours after the death of Manisha. 

 Besides, they took her halfway across the city to CMRI, on Diamond Harbour Road, instead of Medical College and Hospital, only a few minutes away, said an officer investigating the case.

 We found out that Manisha fell off the second-floor flat around 6.15am. After the CMRI doctors declared her brought dead, the Bajorias returned home and informed the police around 9am, said the officer.

 We took the body to Medical College for post-mortem, he added. 

 According to Gopal, a pedestrian informed the family about Manishas fall. The Bajorias claimed that they rushed Manisha to hospital after taking Poonam home, said the officer.

 Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee stated: We have not arrested or detained anyone as no one has lodged a complaint. But we are examining the statements by the family members and their neighbours. 

 The police conducted a magisterial inquest which is a must when a woman dies under mysterious circumstances within seven years of marriage before sending the body for post-mortem.

 The nature of the internal injuries can only be known after the post-mortem, said Chatterjee. 

 The Bajorias could not explain the delay in informing the police, said the investigators. 

 If required, we will send the child for a medical examination. We will find out what caused the bruises, said an officer on the case.

 The family declined comment on the matter.

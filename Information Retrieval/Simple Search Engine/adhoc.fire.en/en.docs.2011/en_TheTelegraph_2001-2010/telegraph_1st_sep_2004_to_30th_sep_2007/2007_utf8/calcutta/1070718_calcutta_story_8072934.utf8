 Federations favourite:

 A derby match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan 

 Apropos the report Glare on cold Calcutta, June 20, the way model Tina Mukherjee was molested and assaulted in the presence of her friend Rahul has once again exposed the inefficiency of police and lack of surveillance on the streets at night. 

 What is strange is that the common people who witnessed the incident did not dare to help the two while they were being harassed. This belies the claim that the common man in Calcutta is among the most helpful in the country. 

 The police seem smug about the law and order situation in the city. They are trying to downplay the incident by claiming that Calcutta is still safer after dark than New Delhi. If that is all the force has been doing after such incidents, many more Tinas will have to suffer molestation in Calcutta after dark. 

 According to the police top brass, the nature of harassment on the streets is changing. We will wait for the day when the police overcome their lassitude and change accordingly to take effective steps against criminals.

 Apropos the report IFA lakhs missing, June 20, it is shocking that the record room of the Indian Football Association (IFA) office was set on fire to destroy accounts-related documents and the treasurer is a prime suspect. Alas! The big guns of the IFA are more involved in monetary game than in the uplift of Indian football, which has hit an abysmal low. The team struggles to win matches even in the preliminary round of the World Cup.

 Apropos the report Kiosk in court focus, June 23, it is laudable on the part of Subhas Dutta to file an affidavit in the high court against kiosks being set up in Citizens Park and failure to make the angel atop Victoria Memorial rotate. It is well-known that politicians and policemen benefit from allowing trading in any part of the city. The high court should look into the matter closely.

 Apropos the report Campus calm after apology, June 23, good sense prevailed on the students of Heramba Chandra College who withdrew their gherao and apologised to the principal and other teachers for their actions to press for a say in the admission process. A peaceful atmosphere should always be maintained at educational institutes. The students need to voice their grievances peacefully. A gherao or a strike ultimately backfires on the students in terms of loss of classes. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala 

Apropos the report G reedy son and son-in-law, June 19, it is disheartening to know that a 85-year-old widower was deprived of his lifes savings by his son and daughter-in-law. How could the son be so selfish, no matter what the provocation from his wife? There should be legal provisions to protect such helpless fathers. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road 

 Extreme greed, immorality, selfishness and

 inhumanity drove Partha Chakraborty to take away his 85-year-old fathers

 savings. The state human rights commission should take action against him

 and his wife. 

 B.N. Bose,

Dum Dum Park 

 Apropos the report Most-dreaded in the Net, June 27, people laugh at such news because everyone knows that the police allow the criminals to flourish before catching them. Otherwise, there would be criminals reigning over every single locality in Calcutta. Police can arrest these criminals if they want to, but do not. It is difficult to understand why the police administration is reluctant to take criminals into custody before they become powerful. There should immediately be a widespread drive to net criminals. 

 Kamruddin Ahmed, 

 Lalbazar Street 

 Apropos the report Hard line on felling, June 19, it is good to know that the state government is planning strict action against those who are felling trees. The initiative will go a long way in protecting our environment. If the environmental laws are implemented properly, well soon live in a much healthier planet. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake 

 Apropos the report Rogue cop thrashed, June 27, it is a shame that the keepers of law can use their power to exploit people. What is worse is the cop who bought fruits from a teenaged vendor and hit him when he demanded payment is not an exception. No wonder, common people try to avoid dealing with police at any cost. 

 Rathin Chatterjee, 

 Dum Dum 

 Everyone from the chief minister down knows

 that policemen do not pay for the stuff they pick up from roadside vendors.

 If the vendors protest, they are not allowed to sit on the pavement. It

 is almost like a weekly payment.

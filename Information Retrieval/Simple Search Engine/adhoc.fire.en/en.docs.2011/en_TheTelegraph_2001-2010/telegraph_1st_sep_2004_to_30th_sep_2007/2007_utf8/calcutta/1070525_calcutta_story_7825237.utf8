 Teen suicide in study

 - Books-vs-friends tussle with parents drives girl to death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Anwesa Bera, 15, wanted to spend more time with her friends. Her parents wanted her to spend more time with her books.

 On Thursday morning, the conflict in the Narkeldanga Main Road home of the Beras so typical of homes with teenaged children ended tragically.

 Anwesa hanged herself with her mothers sari from the ceiling of her study at home.

 This was the Class X students final act of protest against her parents who were urging her to give more thought to her studies.

 Around 8.30am, when her mother went to the room with Anwesas breakfast, she found her eldest daughter hanging from the ceiling.

 Anwesas father Prakash Bera, who runs a business and is also a local cable operator, rushed to her first-floor study after he heard his wife crying out for help.

 The girl, known as Mumpa to family and friends, was taken to NRS Medical College where she was declared dead.

 The girl was wearing jeans and a top when she was found hanging. She didnt leave behind any suicide note. But it appears that a tiff with her parents prompted her to take the extreme step, said a senior officer of Phoolbagan police station.

 The elder of the two sisters, Anwesa was spending too much time with her friends and too little time studying, felt her parents.

 They told her repeatedly to take her Class X studies, in Suraj Kanya Vidyalaya on CIT Road, more seriously, said a relative.

 Anwesas parents had decided that her aunt would go to teach her at home to ensure that she would sit with her books. We were getting ready to go to their place when the phone rang. It was her father informing us that Mumpa had committed suicide, recounted her aunts husband.

 Neighbours expressed shock at the tragic turn of events.

 Last night, we heard her parents trying to explain to her that now that she was in Class X, it was time she took her studies seriously... Mumpa would sleep on the ground floor and then go up in the morning to her study, said a neighbour.

 The teenaged girl apparently refused to have dinner with her parents on Wednesday. Early on Thursday, she went up to her study to end her life.

 Problems between parents and children are very common these days, especially on the subject of studies. If a child is emotionally high-strung and sensitive, she might be pushed to commit suicide, observed psychologist Atashi Gupta.

 It depends on the personality type, but the one thing that works on their minds is punishing the parents for the rest of their lives, she added.

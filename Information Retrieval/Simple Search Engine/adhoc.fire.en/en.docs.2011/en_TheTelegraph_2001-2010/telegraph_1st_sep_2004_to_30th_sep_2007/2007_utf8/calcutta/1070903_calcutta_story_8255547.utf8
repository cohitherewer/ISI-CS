 New varsity building on schedule

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University is on track to start spot evaluation of answer scripts in all subjects. The first phase of work on the five-storeyed building where spot evaluation will be conducted will be complete by October-end.

 Currently, spot evaluation, in which a large number of examiners sit under one roof and correct answer scripts, is done for only a few subjects. Once the new building in Hastings, where the universitys controller of examinations department will be shifted, is ready, spot evaluation will be started for all subjects.

 The examinations department is now housed on the universitys administrative campus on College Street.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) have agreed to offer necessary support to the university to complete the first phase of construction of the building by October-end. 

 The university had undertaken the project early this year to ensure smooth conduct of undergraduate examinations, especially to expedite the process of publication of BA, B.Sc and B.Com exam results.

 The university has been struggling to publish results in time, with the number of undergraduate students going up. Lack of space is the main problem in starting spot evaluation now.

 Spot evaluation has become very important to avoid delay in publication of results of undergraduate examinations. By replacing the old system, we can avoid the drawn-out process of distributing answer scripts to examiners and taking them back after correction for preparing the results. The ground floor of our Hastings building will be used exclusively for spot evaluation, said Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).

 The CMC and CMDA are helping the university draw up the building plan, fill up the land and carry out soil tests. The two bodies are offering the services free.

 The university officials met representatives of the CMC and CMDA last week and discussed implementation of various expansion programmes. 

 The university has earmarked Rs 4 crore for the Hastings building, Rs 1 crore for revamp of the Alipore campus and Rs 78 lakh for upgrade of the guest house in Ballygunge science college. The funds are being provided by the University Grants Commission.

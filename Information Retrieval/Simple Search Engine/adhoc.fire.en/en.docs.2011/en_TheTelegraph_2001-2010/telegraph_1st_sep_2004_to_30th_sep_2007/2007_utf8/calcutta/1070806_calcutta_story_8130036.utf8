 Salt Lake City, with its rapid expansion, is ready for an automated parking lot. A Telegraph picture

 Salt Lake residents are set to get an automated parking lot, which will share space with a mall and a multiplex.

 The complex will come up on 4.5 acres opposite the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) administrative building in Sector I.

 Twelve companies have participated in the bidding. We hope to finish the processing work by the second week of August, following which construction will begin. The project will be ready in a year and a half, said P.R. Baviskar, the chief executive officer of the CMDA, which will execute the Rs 16-crore project.

 The parking lot, with space for 200 cars, will be set up in a four-storeyed building that will also house a mall and a multiplex. The parking fee will be reasonable, he added.

 The private-public partnership model has been selected for the project.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has built automated parking lots at Rawdon Square and under Lindsay Street. A third, to be developed by the public works department, is expected at BBD Bag.

 With the rapid development of Salt Lake, especially with the expansion of Sector V and the new township at Rajarhat, an automated parking lot has become an absolute necessity for smooth movement of traffic in the township, said a senior CMDA official.

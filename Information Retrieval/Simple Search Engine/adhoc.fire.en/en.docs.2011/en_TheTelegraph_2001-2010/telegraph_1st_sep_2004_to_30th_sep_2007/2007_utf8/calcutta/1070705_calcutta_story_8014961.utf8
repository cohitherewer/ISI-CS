 Reviving Tagores legacy

 With a mission to make Tagores works accessible and meaningful to the young generation in pure and authentic form, Niva Arts and Sravasti have planned a year-long series of projects comprising Tagores timeless music and literary masterpieces. This evenings programme features Aashaadh and Shrimati Hey, the first two of this series. Aashaadh deals with the three crucial years of Tagores life when he was suffused with international fame and recognition. Its songs, poems and translations echo the emotions he felt during the aashaadh months of these three years. Central to Tagores life, literature, art and music is the figure of Natun Bouthan Kadambari Devi, his favourite sister-in-law, who inspired and influenced his prolific creative output. Shrimati Hey is an attempt to pay tribute to her through some of Tagores most sensuous and lyrical works. Participants: Chaitali Dasgupta (picture above), Debashis Roy Chowdhury, Aniruddha Sinha, Agnimitra Ghosh, Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee, Ritacheta Goswami, Rohini Roy Chowdhury and Bidipta Chakraborty. Concept and direction: Chaitali Dasgupta.

 Event: A programme of readings, poems and songs of Tagore When: Today

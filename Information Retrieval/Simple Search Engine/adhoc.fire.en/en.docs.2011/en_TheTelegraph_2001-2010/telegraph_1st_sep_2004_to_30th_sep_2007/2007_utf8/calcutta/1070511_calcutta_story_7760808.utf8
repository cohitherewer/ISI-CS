 Police add to ordeal of robbed man

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A group of three intercepted a petrol pump-owner on Strand Road on Wednesday night and snatched Rs 5,000 from him at gun-point. The trio melted into the crowd before the victim could shout for help.

 The ordeal was far from over. The man had run from pillar to post for police help. After a couple of hours, he finally managed to lodge a complaint with Hare Street police station. 

 One of the three, named Babua, was arrested from Babughat around midnight and Rs 1,000 recovered from him. A hunt is on for the other two.

 Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters), said the snatching took place around 8.15pm at the intersection of Strand Road and Auckland Road. Somnath Dutta was returning home on his motorcycle. As he approached the crossing, the three goons stopped him. One whipped out a firearm. The other two snatched Duttas wallet and fled. 

 Dutta went to a nearby kiosk of Hare Street police station but the two constables posted there directed him to North Port police station, citing jurisdiction. Once there, the officers sent him back to Hare Street.

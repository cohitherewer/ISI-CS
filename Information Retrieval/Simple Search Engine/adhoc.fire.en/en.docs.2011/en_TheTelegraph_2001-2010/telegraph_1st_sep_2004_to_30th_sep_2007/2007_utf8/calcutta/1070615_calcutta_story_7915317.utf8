 Guardian angel of Lakes

 - Police outpost-in-charge has averted 13 suicide bids in 17 months

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Biplab Chatterjee has never watched Baywatch. He has never had anyone remotely resembling Pamela Anderson to lift his morale at work. But that hasnt stopped him from doing his job saving lives.

 In the past 17 months, Chatterjee has saved 13 lives at the Dhakuria Lakes a popular suicide point for the desperate and the depressed.

 The 48-year-old sub-inspector of Lake police station has played saviour to a cross-section of people a homemaker from a well-to-do family to a starving father-son duo from a remote village to a 70-year-old man from Lake Gardens, driven to despair by the apathy of his family members.

 In 2006, 11 persons were rescued from the Dhakuria Lakes. Two more lives were saved this year, says Chatterjee, in charge of the police outpost at the Lakes for the past two years. Most cases were touch-and-go; even a moments delay could have cost a life, he adds.

 Chatterjee, a resident of Duttapukur, in North 24-Parganas, was a good swimmer from childhood. I grew up in a village and swimming for a couple of hours was a routine during my school days, reveals the policeman, who still does a few laps of his para pond every day.

 The Sourav Ganguly fan plays down his role as the guardian angel of the Lakes. I am just doing my job. This is the duty of a policeman. Besides, my colleagues who keep a vigil with me also deserve credit. We keep a close eye on the Lakes, almost round-the-clock, states Chatterjee.

 And the results are already showing. The intensified vigil by Chatterjee and his men has brought down the number of suicide attempts at the Lakes quite dramatically. This year, two lives have been saved and none has been lost, says the deputy commissioner of police (south division), Ajay Kumar.

 Some like the penniless father-son duo from a Raidighi village were dragged out of the water by Chatterjee, while others like the wife of a businessman were intercepted before they could plunge into the water. It is all about being alert and acting swiftly, says Chatterjee.

 Bengali software upgrade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state information technology (IT) department is developing a Bengali word processing software for error-free and easy computing in government departments. 

 The Bengali word processing software currently being used by the government is difficult to operate, according to employees. 

 Experts have also detected problems with the way fonts are rendered by the software in different machines. Complaints have been pouring in about the software for the past year. 

 A lot of official work is done in Bengali. So, it is important for the Bengali word processing software to function properly, explained an official of the IT department. 

 Owing to the shortcomings of the software, important e-governance projects are suffering, said sources in the department.

 State IT minister Debesh Das stressed the need for ironing out glitches in the Bengali word processing software for smooth implementation of e-governance projects.

 The department will set up a centre in the city, where the new software will be developed by a team of IT experts, linguists from Bangla Akademi and eminent writers. The project will cost about Rs 2 crore.

 The new software is expected to be introduced in the next fiscal. All government departments might not replace the existing Bengali word processing software with the upgraded version, said officials. 

 The software will be of international standard. It will be user-friendly and will ensure that there are no font-related problems. The keyboards being used will also be upgraded, stated the minister.

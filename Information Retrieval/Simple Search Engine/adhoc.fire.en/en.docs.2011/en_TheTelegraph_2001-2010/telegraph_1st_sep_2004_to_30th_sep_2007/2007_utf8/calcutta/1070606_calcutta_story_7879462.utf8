The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crackdown on polluting vehicles

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Come September, the city will see a five per cent dip in its vehicular population of 11.5 lakh, and a further reduction of five per cent in the following month, if the state transport department has its way.

 A transport department official said a combination of administrative and and pollution-control measures would result in around 1,20,000 vehicles being declared condemned.

 There have been several attempts to take condemned and polluting vehicles off the road, but none worked out for reasons beyond our control. But this time the steps are being planned in a way that we are confident of the outcome, the official asserted.

 The department is modifying the tax structure for vehicles and fine-tuning strategies to phase out old vehicles. We are modifying the tax structure and will introduce a format that would be specific to the type of the vehicle and its condition. We are also working on strategies to phase out old vehicles. The fine paid by vehicles flouting emission norms will be raised, the official pointed out.

 As part of the strategy to get rid of old vehicles, the department will conduct random auto-emission tests across the city. By the end of this month, several teams of motor vehicles inspectors would take to the road with auto-emission testing units and check vehicles at random. Senior officials will supervise the teams functioning and submit reports daily, the official said.

 By next week, mobile remote-sensing units will be installed across the city.

 Each device will have a camera that will capture the registration numbers of vehicles passing by, and sensors that will analyse emitting standards of the vehicles. The department has set a target to inspect 6,000-8,000 vehicles a day. 

 The data we will receive from each unit will be fed into the computer. We will take punitive measures, including cancellation of the permit, against the owners of offending vehicles, said an official.

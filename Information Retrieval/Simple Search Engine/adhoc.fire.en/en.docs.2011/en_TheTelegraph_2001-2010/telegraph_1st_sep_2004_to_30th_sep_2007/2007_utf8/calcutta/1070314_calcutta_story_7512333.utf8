The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 State to explain bridge site shift

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Tuesday asked the state government to explain why the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has changed its plan to construct a motorable concrete bridge over Kestopur canal, between Kestopur and Salt Lakes AK and AJ blocks.

 The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.K. Ghosh also directed the government to state its new plan, if any, regarding the bridge.

 The order followed a public interest litigation by Baroari Tala Purba Para Nagar Unnyan Samity, an organisation of Kestopur residents. 

 It alleged that the CMDA had started construction of a steel bridge about 3.5 km from the site of the original bridge.

 The new bridge will not serve any purpose. Only two-wheelers will be allowed to ply on it. A large number of people in Salt Lake and Kestopur will benefit if a concrete bridge is constructed according to the original plan, argued the petitioners.

 The states lawyer said: The new bridge is being constructed two km, and not 3.5 km, from the original site. The bridge was shifted due to lack of space.

 Some residents of Salt Lake were not happy with the CMDAs decision and are trying to shift the bridge, stated a member of the petitioner organisation.

 The case will come up for hearing after four weeks, when the government and the CMDA will have to file their affidavits before the court.

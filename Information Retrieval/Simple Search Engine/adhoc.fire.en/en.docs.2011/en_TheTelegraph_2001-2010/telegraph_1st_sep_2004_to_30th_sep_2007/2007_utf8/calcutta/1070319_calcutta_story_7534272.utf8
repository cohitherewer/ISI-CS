 The foundation stone of an eco-friendly housing estate, Upohar the Condoville, was laid by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi on Saturday. 

 The 19-acre project by Bengal Ambuja, at Chawkgaria, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, will comprise 1,213 apartments for all income groups. The estate is scheduled to be ready in 24 months.

 We have divided the estate in three categories LIG, MIG and HIG. There will be 248 LIG flats, 360 MIG flats and 605 HIG apartments. We will offer 13 types of HIG flats, with facilities like gym, training centre and jogging tracks, said Harshvardhan Neotia, managing director of Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Limited.

 He added the project has been designed according to the norms of the environment ministry and the state pollution control board.

 The project was conceptualised five years back but we waited for clearances from different environmental agencies. Within the complex, there would be a large waterbody surrounded by greenery, added Neotia.

 The housing project will also have an activity centre and a vocational training centre. 

 The activity centre will comprise a community hall, a games room, a gym and a swimming pool. 

 The HIG towers will be surrounded by an open green space that will include a jogging track, a childrens park and an amphitheatre.

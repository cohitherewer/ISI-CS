 State dairy spews smoke

 We are the residents of Dutta Bagan Milk Colony at Belgachhia in the northern part of Calcutta. Over the last three years a Government of West Bengal undertaking, Central Dairy, has been a major pollutant in the area. 

 The problem

 Central Dairy, located near a primary school and a childrens park, is polluting the locality severely, day and night. A thick black smoke rises constantly from its broken chimney with defective valves and poses a major health hazard. The smoke often has a foul smell.

 It is unfortunate that when ministers keep harping on the virtues of controlling environment pollution, they cannot ensure that a government controlled agency follows the norms.

 Complaints

 We complained to the body responsible, the dairy authority, and to the regulator supposed to control it, West Bengal Pollution Control Board, but did not get any respite. Whenever we complain to the additional milk commissioner or other dairy officials, they admit that the broken chimney and defective valves are the reason for the pollution and promise that a new chimney would come up soon. But the broken chimney has been in place for three years!

 A complaint was lodged to the member secretary of the Pollution Control Board in 2004, but nothing came out of it. We have lodged another complaint to the board recently and a hearing has been allotted, but we do not have much hope.

 I would like to appeal to the administration to ensure that the charity of giving us pollution-free air begins at home, with the governments own industrial unit.

 STAT TALK 

 Industries 

 There are over 8,000 industries within the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area, including big, medium and small units, according to the environment cell of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.

 Many of the industries are located in residential areas and can turn into a major hazard. A large stretch of north Calcutta, especially areas around Chiria More, and pockets in south Calcutta like Tiljala and Topsia, are the most vulnerable.

 The industries in these areas could prove extremely polluting if they are not monitored properly.

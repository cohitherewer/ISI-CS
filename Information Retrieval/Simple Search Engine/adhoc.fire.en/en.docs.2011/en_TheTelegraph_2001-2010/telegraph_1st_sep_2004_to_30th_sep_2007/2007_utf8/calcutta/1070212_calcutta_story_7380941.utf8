 Compilation of schemes

 - NEW CIVIC BUDGET

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) budget will no longer be a statement of projected income and expenditure, but will list the schemes the civic body intends taking up in the next fiscal.

 The budget for 2007-08 that mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya will table in March will be in the new format. Mayoral council members and departmental heads are busy compiling schemes for inclusion in the budget.

 In the new system, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay explained, a project mentioned in the budget will not face any shortage of funds. Hence, it will be the sole responsibility of the department concerned to execute the project within a particular fiscal.

 Chief of municipal finance and accounts Debotosh Dasgupta said the CMC is now confident enough, financially, to draw up a programme-based budget.

 The conventional, or incremental, budget had two main parts. One part detailed the income and expenditure in the ongoing fiscal and the other provided an estimate of the income and expenditure in the next fiscal.

 Projects the civic body intended to take up found mention only in the mayors budget speech. At times, however, one or two key schemes found mention in the budget.

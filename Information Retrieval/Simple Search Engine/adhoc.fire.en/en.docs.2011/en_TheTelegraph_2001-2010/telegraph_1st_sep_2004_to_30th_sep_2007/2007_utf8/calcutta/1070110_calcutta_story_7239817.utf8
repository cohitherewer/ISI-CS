 Songs of the soil brought relief from the winter chill in a strip of a park at Shaktigarh, Jadavpur, this weekend. The second Baul-Fakir Utsav saw Kartik Das, Satyananda Das, Biswanath Das and Gour Khyapa share the stage a line-up not seen even at Joydeber Mela at Kenduli.

 With a footfall count of more than 4,000 over two days, the word-of-mouth campaign of the organisers worked well. The soiree, organised by NGO Marfat with financial help from music-lovers and associates, saw 32 artistes take the stage. Bonnie Chakraborty, former Krosswindz frontman and member of folk-fusion band Oikyotaan, was in charge of the sound.

 Among the known faces in the crowd were British producer-guitarist Sam Mills, percussionist Tanmoy Bose, anchor Keya Chaitali Basu and actor Parambrata Chatterjee. Members of a number of city bands also dropped in. 

 Day One saw the much-anticipated performance by Kartik Das Baul, considered one of the best players of khamak in the community. His recital showed why. This was followed by his duet with Gour Khyapa, perhaps the most eccentric talent on show. Their opening track was the improvised Kaj cholchhe shortcut-e. Mahajan pad followed after requests from the audience. All along, Teenkari Das Baul on dubki and Nitai Das on khol provided percussive support to the singers.

 The first day also saw performances by veteran Biswanath Das and vibrant recitals by Kanai Mondal, Tarak Das Baul, Uttam Das Baul, Subhadra and Tulika Hazra. 

 On Day Two, Golam Fakir, Akkash Fakir, Amirul Fakir, Armaan Fakir, Bedana Fakirani, Kalachand Darvish, Satyananda Das, Heera Shah and Haradhan Das Baul performed. 

 Golams rendition of Allah ho Allah was the high point of the evening, highlighting his skill on dotara as much as his contagious on-stage energy. Akkashs set was heart-warming, with a superb rendition of Manush bhoje je jona. Satyananda Das Bauls set reflected his maturity and excellent modulation. 

 While Haradhan Dass Hrid Majhare was the concluding song, performances spilled on to the adjoining akhras, and the festival carried on long after it was officially over.

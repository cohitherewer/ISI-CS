 Suicide hint after murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Manojit Bhuinya, suspected of killing his 26-year-old pregnant aunt, may have committed suicide on Saturday. He was killed when his motorcycle collided with a truck on Kalyani Expressway. 

 Manojit used to live with his uncle Subrata Shashmal and his wife Mousumi at Thakurpukur. 

 On Saturday afternoon, Subrata found his wife lying in their flat in a pool of blood with her skull fractured. According to police, Manojit had developed a relationship with Mousumi.

 It appears that soon after the murder, Manojit fled on his two-wheeler minus a helmet. The nature of the mishap and statements by the local residents suggest that the 30-year-old rode down the middle of the expressway to ram into a truck. Why he went to such a distant place, about 45 km from Calcutta, is yet to be ascertained, said superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta.

 We have reason to believe that it was a suicide, stated an officer of Thakurpukur police station after a visit to the accident site.

 In another development, police have recovered a pestle that might have been used to hit Mousumi on the head. An officer investigating the case said the suspicion on Manojit had become stronger after his suicide.

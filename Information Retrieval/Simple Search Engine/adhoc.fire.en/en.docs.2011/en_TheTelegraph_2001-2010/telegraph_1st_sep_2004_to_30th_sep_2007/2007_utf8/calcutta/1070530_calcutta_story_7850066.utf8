The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Paresh Rawal

 Always eager to finish projects on time, youre efficient and cooperative but never aggressive. You learn from others perspectives,

 and are masterful about incorporating them into yours. For you, there is

 no such thing as failure. You must allow room for discussion. You prefer

 to run things rather than take orders. You are very demanding in your relationships

 and can do a lot for your partner too.

 Kusum Bhandari

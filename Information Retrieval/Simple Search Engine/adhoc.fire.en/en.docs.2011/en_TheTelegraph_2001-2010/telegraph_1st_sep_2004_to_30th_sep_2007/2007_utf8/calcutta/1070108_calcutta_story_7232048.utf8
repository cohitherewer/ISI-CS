The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Governor stands up for battered rickshaw-puller

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Governor Gopal Krishna 

 Gandhi

 Seeing a rickshaw-puller being 

 beaten up by a policeman for coming in the way of his 

 convoy on Friday night, Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi stood 

 up for the common man.

 Stopping his convoy, the governor asked a pilot car officer to enquire what was happening and then instructed officials to identify the rickshaw-puller so he could say sorry to him.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim told Metro on Sunday: The incident took place around 8.30 pm, when the governors convoy was heading towards EM Bypass. All of a sudden, a rickshaw-puller came in the way of the convoy and our men tried to take him away.

 Suddenly, he was beaten up by a man. Seeing this, the governor stopped his convoy and asked the policemen to identify the rickshaw-puller.

 Shamim said an investigation has been ordered to ascertain whether the man who assaulted the rickshaw-puller belonged to the traffic police.

 Raj Bhavan sources said the governor has taken exception to the manner in which the rickshaw-puller was beaten up by a policeman.

 Recalling the incident, a sergeant said the rickshaw-puller was in a hurry and did not notice the traffic signal. He tried to cross the road, unaware that the governors convoy was approaching.

 When he was in the middle of the road, a traffic constable caught hold of him and slapped him. The convoy arrived by then, he said.

 Sensing trouble, the constable left the spot and the rickshaw-puller was allowed to proceed. Suddenly, the governor stopped his convoy and the pilot car officer came out of his vehicle. He said the governor wanted to know why the poor man was beaten up and why the other policemen did not object, he added.

 The officer narrated the chain of events to the governor. 

 He returned after a couple of minutes and told the policemen that the governor wanted to know the whereabouts of the man, as he wished to say sorry to him.

 Debabrata Bose, officer-in-charge, East Traffic Guard, said an inquiry is on to ascertain whether the rickshaw-puller was, indeed, beaten by a policeman.

 A large crowd had gathered on the spot after the governors convoy stopped at the intersection. A preliminary probe has revealed that the person who had beaten up the rickshaw-puller was not in uniform. Stringent action will be taken if he belongs to the the traffic police. Bose said.

 We have identified the rickshaw-puller today and he is from Tiljala Road. We are awaiting Raj Bhavans instructions. If the governor is willing to meet him, we will take him there, he added.

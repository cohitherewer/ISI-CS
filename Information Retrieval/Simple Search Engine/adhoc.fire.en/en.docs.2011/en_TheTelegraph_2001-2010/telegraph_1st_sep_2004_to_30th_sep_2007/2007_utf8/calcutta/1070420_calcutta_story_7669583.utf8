 Jorasanko campus on boil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Jorasanko campus of Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) is on the boil, with a section of teachers and officials planning protests against a few decisions of the authorities.

 What have aggrieved the employees are the universitys decision to shift the fine arts faculty from Jorasanko to the Emerald Bower campus on BT Road, terminate the services of the security officer and resume the light-and-sound show at a cost of Rs 60 lakh.

 Leaders of the agitating employees said they would decide on their course of action in the next few days. Some said they could even approach the state human rights commission on the job-termination issue.

 The teachers are opposed to the shift of the fine arts faculty on the grounds that the BT Road campus does not have the infrastructure for teaching courses in performing arts, like drama, dance and vocal music.

 Its not that we dont want to move to the BT Road campus. What we are demanding is that the authorities first put in place proper infrastructure there, said Debashis Mondal, secretary of the RBU Fine Arts Faculty Teachers Association.

 Vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee was not available for comment, while registrar Santosh Ghorui said: The teachers of the fine arts faculty inspected the BT Road campus today and will submit a report stating their stand. We will take a decision after going through the report.

 The officials have accused the authorities of high-handedness for abruptly terminating the services of a security officer.

 The officer had retired in February and was granted a six-month extension. But he submitted an application last Tuesday, stating that he would not be able to work for the entire six-month period because of his failing health and would like to retire on April 30.

 On receiving the letter, the authorities allegedly asked him to stop reporting for work from the next day without citing any reason. They also allegedly forced him to leave the campus immediately.

 We are not going to tolerate this kind of attitude of the authorities. If necessary, we will approach the human rights commission, said a member of the RBU Officers Association.

 As for the light-and-sound show, the teachers and officials have objected to its resumption with funds from the distance education programme.

 The registrar refused comment on the two issues.

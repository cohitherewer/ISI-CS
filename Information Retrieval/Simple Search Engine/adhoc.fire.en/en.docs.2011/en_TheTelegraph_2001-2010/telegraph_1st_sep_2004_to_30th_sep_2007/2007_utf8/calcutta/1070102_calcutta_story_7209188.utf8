 Lady luck in lock-up 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 What happens when the army goes on the rampage to free an officer from police custody? All others in the lock-up enjoy a free run.

 Happy New Year got a whole new meaning for nine unruly 31st night revellers when armymen stormed Park Street police station and snatched away two of their colleagues Major Chandra Prakash Singh and Captain Mahesh arrested for misbehaving with women on New Years Eve.

 Lady luck smiled on the year-end rowdies picked up from various parts of Park Street on charges of mischief in public.

 We had just started the formalities to book the offenders when the army people arrived. By the time they left after snatching their colleagues from behind the bars, the lock-up was empty, recalled duty officer Uttam Mukherjee.

 Every year, 50 to 60 unruly revellers are arrested in the Park Street area on New Years Eve. Police let them go after a dressing down in front of their parents or guardians after a few hours in the lock-up. But this time, the rowdies got away real easy, thanks to the army operation on Park Street a little after midnight.

 As Lt Col Pratap Singh marshalled the mayhem inside the police station, five jawans rushed to the lock-up. Nikalo hamhe Jaldi (Get us out, fast), Major Singh and Captain Mahesh shouted from behind the bars.

 The search for the keys began with some jawans entering the additional officer-in-charge Tenzing Bhutias room, next to the lock-up, overturning tables, chairs and other furniture. 

 The jawans held sub inspector Buddhadeb Kundu at gunpoint to get the keys to the lock-up. Then, a jawan pushed the imposing iron door open and the two arrested army officers were set free.

 As the cops ran for cover, the lock-up door remained open and after around five minutes, the reveller rowdies spied their chance and slipped out. With no one to stop them, they melted into the night.

 The armymen were carrying semi-automatic guns... Our men were scared and could not stop the others from fleeing the lock-up, admitted Kuldiep Singh, special inspector general, administration.

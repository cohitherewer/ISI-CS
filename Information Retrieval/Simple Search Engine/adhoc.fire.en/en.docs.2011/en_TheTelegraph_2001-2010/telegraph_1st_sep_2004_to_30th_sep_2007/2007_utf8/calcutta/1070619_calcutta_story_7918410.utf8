 CAS launch to be delayed

 - Cable operators and MSOs push back roll-out to October

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The launch of the second phase of the conditional access system (CAS) in the city will be pushed back from August to October.

 The Union information and broadcasting (I amp;B) ministry is yet to issue a formal notice in this regard because of opposition by a section of broadcasters and multi-system operators (MSOs). 

 The ministry is waiting for a report on the status of CAS Phase I, launched in the city on January 1, 2007, said a ministry official.

 It is of no use to launch the second phase now. Some MSOs have failed to encrypt the digital signals even five months after the launch of the first phase. It is important to rein in those who are, perhaps, trying to sabotage the entire process, added the ministry official. 

 The decision to launch CAS Phase II by August was taken at a meeting at the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) office in Delhi on April 5, where representatives of the regulator and the I amp;B ministry met MSOs from Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. We have to set a time-frame of 120 days for MSOs and cable operators to prepare for the launch, said the I amp;B official.

 The formal notification is expected in June, according to him. CAS Phase II will not make it to the city before October, said Abhijit Sanyal, city representative of Trai. 

 A formal notification from the I amp;B ministry will not pave the way for a smooth roll-out of CAS Phase II, feel industry insiders. 

 With disputes festering between broadcasters and the new MSOs, there can be further delays in the launch of CAS, said an industry insider. 

 Cable operators and MSOs in Calcutta have in the past employed unfair means to earn money from the consumers. The introduction of CAS in the city will make them accountable. They will find it impossible to use unscrupulous means to fleece the consumer, he explained.

 The second phase of the launch will cover Kalyani, Dum Dum, Tallah Park, Sodepur, Khardah, Barrackpore, Shyamnagar, Naihati, Kanchrapara and Barasat, which fall under Zone II of the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA), as decided by Trai.

 CAS Phase II will be introduced simultaneously in Esplanade, Park Street, Camac Street, Salt Lake, Lake Gardens, Garia, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge, Tollygunge and surrounding areas, which are under Zone IV of the CMA.

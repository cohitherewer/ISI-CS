 The great learning divide

 - SOUTH SCHOOLS SHUN ASPIRANTS FROM NORTH

 STUDY POSER: Should area of domicile dictate the spread of the flames of knowledge? A Telegraph picture

 Ronit Mohta, 4, was refused admission in a reputed central Calcutta school. Reason: He lives in Bangur. 

 A south Calcutta school rejected Bijoy Senguptas application for admission because he lives in Belghoria. 

 Where you stay can determine which school your child goes to. More and more schools in south Calcutta are turning away children who stay in the north. The logic: The journey to and from the school will take a long time. The authorities, however, seldom spell out the reason. 

 During the admission interview, the school officials kept asking us where we lived. We were also asked how our child would reach school and return. Our application was turned down on the grounds that we stay in another part of the city, said Ronits mother Manisha.

 When parents apply to a school for their childs admission, they weigh the pros and cons. It is the responsibility of the parents to drop the child at school and pick him up from there. The school should not deny admission to a child just because he lives in another part of the city, she added.

 The schools refused to go on record on the issue. Denying admission to students who live far away is an unwritten policy in many reputed English-medium schools, said a teacher of one of the schools. 

 According to the schools, there are plenty of good institutions in all parts of the city. Things have changed. Each locality has schools. The parents need not concentrate on a handful of institutions. There is a limit to the number of students they can accommodate, said a teacher of another school.

 The parents want the restriction on admission to be mentioned in the application forms. The school authorities raise irrelevant questions about where the child stays only during the interview. This is unfair, said Bijoys father Debabrata.

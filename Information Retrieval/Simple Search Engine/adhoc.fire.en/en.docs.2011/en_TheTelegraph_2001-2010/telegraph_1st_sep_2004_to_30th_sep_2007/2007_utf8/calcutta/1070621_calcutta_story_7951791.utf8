 Missing girl sends letter to court

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Rimita Naskar

 Amid the confusion over the whereabouts of Rimita Naskar missing from her Salt Lake home since June 12 an alleged letter from her surfaced at the Bidhannagar sub-divisional magistrates court on Wednesday afternoon. 

 As the bail plea of Tapan Das Adhikari, arrested on a complaint by Rimitas family, came up for hearing, the private tutor of the 23-year-old girl entered the courtroom and handed over a piece of paper to the public prosecutor, Anjan Chowdhury. 

 Achintya Ghosh claimed that the piece of paper was a letter from Rimita. According to him, his student had called him up on Sunday to inform him that she has got married. 

 She is upset over the treatment meted out to Tapan since she went missing. This letter is a request from her to free her friend, said Ghosh, who surprised everyone in the courtroom with his sudden entry. 

 Tapan was picked up on the night of June 14 after Rimitas father, Shankar Naskar, filed a complaint alleging Tapan and some of his friends were behind Rimitas disappearance. He was produced in the court the next day and remanded in police custody for seven days. 

 I handed over the letter to magistrate Bipasha Mandal. But she did not take any cognisance of the letter and turned down Tapans bail plea, said public prosecutor Chowdhury. 

 Besides sending Tapan to another seven days in judicial custody, the magistrate said that Rimita would have to appear in the courtroom in person to make her point. 

 The investigating officers of Bidhannagar (North) police station, who have till now drawn a blank in the missing girl mystery, were also foxed with the letter twist in the disappearance drama.

 We will grill her teacher on how he got in touch with Rimita, said Ashok Biswas, additional superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas). Till now, police have raided a number of places in South 24-Parganas in search of Rimita. 

 Now, it appears that she is hiding somewhere In such a situation, it is not possible for us to keep Tapan in detention. We may have to drop the charges against him and let him go, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas). 

 We will also send Rimitas purported letter to handwriting experts, he added.

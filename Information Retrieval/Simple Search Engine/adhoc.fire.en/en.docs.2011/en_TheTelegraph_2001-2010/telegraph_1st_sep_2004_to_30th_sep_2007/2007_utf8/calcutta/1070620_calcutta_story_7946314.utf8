 Engineer missing

 Anup Ranjan Roy, missing since Monday morning from his Budge Budge workplace

A 55-year-old engineer has been missing from his Budge Budge office since Monday morning. 

 Anup Ranjan Roy, a senior engineer with CESC Ltd, worked at the chemical laboratory of its Budge Budge plant, on the southern fringes of the city. He lived on Ullas Kar Dutta Road, in the Bagha Jatin area, with his wife and two children.

 According to his family members, Roy had told his wife Tapasi that he would do a double shift both day and night in office and return home on Monday evening. 

 For the past two days, my father was not keeping well. He had a pain in his right leg, so he didnt go to office. We asked him to come back as soon as his office gets over, said daughter Debadrita. 

 On Monday, when Roy did not return even after 8pm, Debadrita called up his office and was told that he had left at 9.40am on Monday.

 He always takes a bus home from work. This is the first time that he has not informed us about his whereabouts, cried Tapasi.

 After searching for him at all possible places, the family lodged missing complaints with Mahestala, Budge Budge and Jadavpur police stations.

 Additional superintendent of police (industrial) D.P. Singh said: We have initiated a search for Roy. We have alerted all the nearby police stations.

 The family has not received any ransom call since Roys disappearance, Debadrita said.

 Roy was a friendly man. He didnt have any enemies. It is surprising that he has gone somewhere without informing his family, his neighbour Ratan Dhar said on Tuesday.

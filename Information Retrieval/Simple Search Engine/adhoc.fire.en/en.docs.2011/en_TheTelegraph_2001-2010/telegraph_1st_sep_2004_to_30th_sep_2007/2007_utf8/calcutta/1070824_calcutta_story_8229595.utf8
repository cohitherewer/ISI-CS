 A fire broke out in a three-storeyed building belonging to the YMCA on Mahatma Gandhi Road on Thursday afternoon.

 Around 30 people were trapped in the building and and had to be rescued by fire-fighters. No one was injured.

 Javed Hasim, a local resident, said the fire broke out around 12.35pm. We heard a loud noise and saw smoke billowing from the meter room that is close to the staircase. The 30-odd people who were in the building could not come out as smoke had engulfed the wooden staircase. Some of them tried to come down but failed, he said.

 Though the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, officials in the fire department said the blaze might have been caused by a short-circuit in one of the meter boxes.

 It appears a short-circuit in a meter box near the entrance to the building had caused the fire. Seven tenders fought for half an hour to bring the blaze under control, said Bibhas Guha, the divisional fire officer.

 The building houses more than 80 commercial establishments, including a few bookshops and tutorial centres, but there are only 20 electric meters. 

 Some of the meters are of the domestic category. An overloading might have led to the short-circuit, said a fire brigade official.

 The extent of the damage is yet to be ascertained. The fire department will lodge a complaint against the owner of the building for not taking precautionary measures.

 The YMCA, however, denied the allegations. We had taken all possible measures. The fire brigade officials should have sent us a notice if they had spotted any lapse. We are consulting the department and will do whatever needs to be done, said S. Sarkar, the YMCA general secretary.

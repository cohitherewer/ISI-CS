The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On safety overdrive

 - Security tools for civic workers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to procure gadgets and protective gear, worth Rs 50 lakh, for the labourers in the drainage department, following a warning from the National Human Rights Commission. 

 According to sources, the commission last month had summoned civic officials to New Delhi and admonished deputy chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) Tushar Ghosh for forcing labourers to work in manholes and without any protective gear.

 Five years ago, during the tenure of the Trinamul Congress-BJP board, the commission had chalked out a set of norms for protection of labourers from injury and infection by pathogenic organisms while working in brick sewers. 

 But the civic board didnt take any measure.

 At present, the drainage department does not have any protective gear for the labourers working in underground brick sewers, except some gas-test equipment.

 Our officials have prepared a 12-point list of protective gear and gadgets, according to the ISI code. I have made the funds available for their immediate procurement, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Five years ago, the human rights commission had directed the civic body to ensure proper safety of the labourers. But, unfortunately, my predecessor didnt take any step. We came to know about the directive only after being summoned by the panel, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Monday.

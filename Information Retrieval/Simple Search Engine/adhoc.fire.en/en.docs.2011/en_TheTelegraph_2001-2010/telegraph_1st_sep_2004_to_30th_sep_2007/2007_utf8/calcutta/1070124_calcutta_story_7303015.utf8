 You share your birthday with...

 Riya Sen and Neil Diamond

 You are open to new ideas, opinions and self-improvement. You are cautious and sensible, especially when making decisions on relationships. Your logical and quick mind is an asset. Getting locked in a routine is not your style. You are the most interesting person to brainstorm with. Kusum Bhandari

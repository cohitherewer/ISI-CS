 Campus trouble

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Protest rocked Rabindra Bharati University over the decision to revive the light-and-sound show at Jorasanko Thakurbari, with Wednesdays scheduled meeting of the executive council and the court being deferred indefinitely.

 Members of the SFI-controlled students union raised slogans against the universitys decision to revive the show with money earned from distance education programmes.

 The revised dates of the meetings will be announced soon, said registrar Santosh Ghorui.

 Swagata Bhattacharya, general secretary of the SFIs Rabindra Bharati unit, said: We are not against the revival of the show, but there are many genuine demands of the students that need to be addressed first. 

 The students have been demanding infrastructure for increasing the number of seats in B.Ed and M.Phil courses and a proper library for the newly-opened mathematics department.

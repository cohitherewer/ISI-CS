The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The case against CNG

 A STAFF REPORTER

 While the government is trying to introduce compressed natural gas (CNG) to contain air pollution in the city, a section of the green brigade is raising questions over the governments intent to fight the foul air.

 The government should first implement its order and ban all three-wheelers, including autorickshaws plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan area, that fail to comply with LPG BSII mass emission standards, said S.M. Ghosh of Calcutta Green Network at a press conference on Friday. 

 Though he admitted that a switch to CNG or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from conventional fuels like petrol and diesel was necessary, he wanted the government to discuss the issue with experts on auto emission before taking a final decision on CNG. 

 The governments plan of bringing in CNG through a pipeline is neither cost-effective nor technically feasible, said Ghosh, suggesting that LPG was a better option. 

 Representatives from the LPG dealers industry echoed Ghosh. 

 We already have 13 LPG stations in and around the city, which are capable of catering to the needs of a majority of the vehicles plying on city roadsThen, LPG is cheaper in comparison to CNG and conversion is cost-effective. So, there is no logic behind bringing in an alternative fuel, pointed out Sharad Jhawar of Greater Calcutta Gas Kit Dealers Forum.

 Bantala unit upkeep outsourced

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has decided to outsource the upkeep of the effluent-treatment plants at Calcutta Leather Complex (CLC), in Bantala.

 The move, finalised at a meeting chaired by land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah on Monday, follows complaints of pollution and poor upkeep of the plants.

 Over 2,000 acres have been affected because of discharge of polluted effluent. Our animals are dying, said Manoara Begum, the sabhapati of Bhangar I panchayat samity, who attended the meeting.

 Mollah said the four effluent-treatment plants, built by ML Dalmiya and Co., are not functioning satisfactorily and two more need to be built. All six will be handed over to a private party, who will be paid by the tanners association.

 Jagmohan Dalmiya, of ML Dalmiya and Co., was present at the meeting. 

 The tanners association has complained of poor infrastructure in the complex. Mollah said: There is not a single clause in the agreement with Dalmiya that goes against him. If we pressure him to commit anything more, he might move court, which will stall the process of making the CLC functional.

 This festive weekend, boundaries are being blurred and dishes are being tailored to suit heterogenous tastebuds. The cross-cultural bite is dominating the Poila Baisakh mood.

 Non-Bengalis are increasingly choosing Bengali food while eating out, a trend that peaks during festive days. Poila Baisakh now is as much a festival of Bengalis as non-Bengalis, just as Bengalis have made Diwali and Holi their own. This time, the Bengali:non-Bengali ratio here will be around 60:40, says Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpies, serving up a variety of vegetarian dishes. Kanchkalar Kofta Curry, Begun Shiraj, Kopi Badshahi and Daab Jhinge are popular picks at the Elgin Lane address.

 Poila Baisakh and Durga puja have become cosmopolitan. And so, we are expecting 30 per cent footfall this weekend to be non-Bengali, adds Joymalya Banerjee, the chef of Oh! Calcutta at Forum, dishing out vegetarian novelties like Shim Aamtel Chorchori, Phoolkopir Roast and Lau-er Payesh.

 But why the sudden spurt in demand? Young Marwaris now eat out a lot and we really enjoy the range of Bengali cuisine on offer around town. We often bring our seniors along to restaurants serving Bengali food as they enjoy the hospitality, say Sandeep and Mridula Agarwal, in their early-30s.

 The novelty factor for them is understandable, but what explains Bengali families flocking to a Poila Baisakh food festival? For many, it is the lure of grandma recipes that are almost impossible to whip up in a nuclear households, points out Ranajit Dutta Gupta, co-partner of Bhojohori Manna, which is expecting every one in four foodies this festive weekend to be non-Bengali.

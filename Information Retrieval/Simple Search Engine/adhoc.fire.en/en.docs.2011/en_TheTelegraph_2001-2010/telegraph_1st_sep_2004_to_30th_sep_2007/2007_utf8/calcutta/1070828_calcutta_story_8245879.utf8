The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Shania Twain

 You are progressive by nature, always trying to improve the way things are. Your simple, down-to-earth ways win others hearts easily. You crave for new adventures and experiences. You excel in team, rather than individual work. You are a loyal, devoted and caring partner.

 Kusum Bhandari

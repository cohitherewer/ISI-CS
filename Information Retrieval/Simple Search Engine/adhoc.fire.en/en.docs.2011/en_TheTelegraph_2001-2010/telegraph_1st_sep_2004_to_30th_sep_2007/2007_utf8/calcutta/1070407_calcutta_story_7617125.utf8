 An autopsy surgeon has drawn fresh blood in the abortion-linked family carnage in Howrah by claiming that Jayanta Bag was murdered. 

 In my report, I am putting it down as a cold-blooded murder The wounds on the body make it clear that it was not a case of suicide, said Harasit Sarkar, who conducted the post-mortem of Bags body. 

 Till now, police have maintained that Bag committed suicide after trying to kill his wife Sutapa now recuperating in Howrah District Hospital and nine-year-old daughter Tiyasa. 

 In his suicide note, Bag had mentioned that he was driven to murder and suicide after a gang of four beat him up on Tuesday night for photographing women who had gone to him for abortions. Bag, a medical officer in a Howrah factory, had a small clinic in his home. 

 The wounds on the body were very deep, which doesnt happen in case of suicide attempts. He had injury marks on the back of his neck, which he could not have inflicted on himself, Sarkar said, challenging the suicide story. 

 Multiple-cut marks on the right side of the body of the right-handed doctor also do not support the suicide theory, added the surgeon. 

 The autopsy surgeons conclusions have complicated the case for the investigating officers, who were forced to lodge a fresh case against Sutapa on Thursday after she confided to her sister, Madhumita Dolui, of throttling Tiyasa to relieve her of the pain. Dolui refused to speak to media. 

 We have not got the post-mortem report and treating it as a case of suicide after two murder attempts, said Niraj Kumar Singh superintendent of police (Howrah). 

 Sarkar is expected to submit his report on Saturday. A forensic team, which visited Bags Andul home on Thursday and collected samples, will submit its report in seven days. 

 Police on its own have made little headway in the investigation. Our officers went to interrogate Sutapa, but she was not medically fit. We will have to wait, said Singh. 

 The hunt for the four men, mentioned in Bags suicide note, has also drawn a blank till now. We are conducting raids and hope to arrest them soon, said Singh.

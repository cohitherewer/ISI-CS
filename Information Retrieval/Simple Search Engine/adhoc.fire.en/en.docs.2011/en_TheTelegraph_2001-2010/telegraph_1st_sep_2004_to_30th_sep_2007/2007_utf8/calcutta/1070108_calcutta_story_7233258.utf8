 Like son, like father

 Will Smith has been a Hollywood star 

 even before his son was born. But, he tells John Hiscock, 

 co-starring with him in his new film was a revelation 

 Will Smith with son Jaden 

 in The Pursuit of Happyness

 With an Oscar nomination and nearly 

 20 movies behind him, Will Smith knows something about acting. 

 Yet it was only when he worked with his eight-year-old son 

 for the first time that he realised how much he had to learn.

 Smith and his son Jaden appear 

 together as father and son in The Pursuit of Happyness, 

 a drama based on the true story of Chris Gardner, a once 

 homeless single father who fought his way up from the streets 

 to become a successful stockbroker and inspirational speaker. 

 On the way he and his son slept rough and endured many hardships.

 Smith is already being talked 

 about as a possible Oscar contender for his performance. 

 But it is Jaden who steals the picture and in doing so 

 gives his father something to think about.

 He actually taught me, says 

 Smith proudly. We were doing a scene one day, and he looked 

 up at me and said, You just do the same thing on every 

 take, daddy. I was like, What? But he got me thinking, 

 and I started watching him.

 Hes so natural, he doesnt care 

 about the budget, he doesnt care about production and he 

 doesnt care about where the camera is; he is just living 

 in the moment. Every single take he was looking at me to 

 see what I was going to say, whereas I came in with a prepared 

 performance that I wanted to deliver. Those ideas were beaten 

 out of my head.

 I think the experience I had 

 working with Michael Mann on Ali and the experience 

 working with my son on this film are the two greatest leaps 

 Ive taken in my career as an actor.

 The Pursuit of Happyness (the 

 mis-spelling comes from graffiti the Gardners see scrawled 

 on a wall) came about when executive producer Mark Clayman 

 saw a programme about the rags-to-riches story of Chris 

 Gardner and the obstacles he had faced. He showed a tape 

 to Smith, who immediately jumped at the idea. I saw the 

 story as the embodiment of the American dream, he says.

 The producers met more than 100 

 children before seeing Jaden Smith, who had never acted 

 before. They hired him immediately. At first, Smith and 

 his wife, the actress Jada Pinkett Smith, were unsure. There 

 were concerns that, as his father, I would have difficulty 

 focusing on my performance in our scenes together, he says. 

 But the reality turned out to be completely different. 

 When I looked in Jadens eyes filled with the pain and anger 

 little Christopher was experiencing, it added to the reality 

 of the scene because I really thought I was failing him 

 as a father.

 As he talks, Smith is his usual 

 cheery, charismatic self. But life has not always been rosy 

 for the 38-year-old actor, who had his first taste of wealth 

 and fame as a teenage rapper in his hometown of Philadelphia. 

 Flush with money and success, he went on an orgy of high-living 

 and big spending that landed him in trouble with the tax 

 man and very nearly in jail.

 His troubles began when he hit 

 the big time as one half of the rap duo DJ Jazzy Jeff and 

 the Fresh Prince. Their second album, Hes the DJ, Im 

 the Rapper (1988), sold three million copies, while 

 the single Parents Just Dont Understand won the 

 first Grammy for a rap performance.

 In 1989 the bubble burst when, 

 at the age of 21, he discovered he was broke and in trouble 

 with the tax man. He blames it on what he calls the Big 

 Willy Syndrome.

 With the Internal Revenue Service 

 pressing him for money, his third album flopped and he discovered 

 that the girl he had been dating for six years had cheated 

 on him while he was on tour. He moved to Los Angeles in 

 the hope of becoming an actor, feeling numb and really 

 depressed. My dream mechanism had been turned off. I was 

 tired, beaten up and lost.

 Then, out of the blue, came the 

 offer of the leading role in the television series The 

 Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, about a street-smart kid from 

 the ghetto who is sent to live with rich relatives. He used 

 the money he earned from his first three years on the show 

 to settle his debt with the IRS.

 The series ran for six seasons, 

 Smith won a second Grammy in 1991 for the song Summertime, 

 and a year later he married model Sheree Zampino. They have 

 a son, Trey, now 11, but they divorced in 1995.

 He and Jada, whom he had known 

 since 1990, when she auditioned for a role on The Fresh 

 Prince, married on New Years Eve in 1997. As well as 

 Jaden, they have a six-year-old daughter, Willow.

 His feature-film breakthrough 

 came when he played a gay hustler posing as Sidney Poitiers 

 son in Six Degrees of Separation. Praised by the 

 critics, his performance established him as a serious actor. 

 He followed that with Bad Boys, Independence Day 

 and the Men in Black films, before winning an 

 Oscar nomination for portraying the former world heavyweight 

 champion in Ali.

 If it happens again this year 

 hell be delighted. The six-week period between the nomination 

 and the award show was one of the most fun rollercoaster 

 rides of my life, he says. Youre part of this special 

 group, and, for that window, everyones a winner. Its something 

 very few people will ever experience.

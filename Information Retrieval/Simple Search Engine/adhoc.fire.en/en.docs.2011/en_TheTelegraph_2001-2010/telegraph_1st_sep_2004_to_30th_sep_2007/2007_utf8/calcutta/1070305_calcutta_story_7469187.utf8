 Lab rein on cyber crime

 - Nasscom to help CID set up wing to track Net offences

 KINSUK BASU

With a sudden spurt in the count of cyber crime cases in the state, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has decided to set up a dedicated laboratory in association with the National Association for Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) to keep a tab on tech terror. 

 As CID sleuths have repeatedly hit tech hurdles while pursuing cases of data theft, online fraud and trade of banned drugs on the Internet, a state-of-the-art cyber crime wing in the state has been a pressing need for some time.

 It is a serious problem for any investigating agency and we cant afford to sit idle. Once the lab is in place, we will be better equipped to handle such cases, said D.P. Tarenia, inspector-general of police (CID). 

 The cyber lab, to be housed at the CID headquarters in Bhabani Bhavan, will be modelled on the lines of the ones in Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune, also set up with help from Nasscom. 

 According to the plans drawn up by the CID and Nasscom, the lab will be in place by March-end and operations will begin after the CID officers complete their training. 

 The training will be conducted by experts from Nasscom The cyber crime graph in the East has recently taken a sharp upswing and we must be equipped to take on the challenge, added Rajeev Kumar, DIG (CID-Operations). 

 Kumar, along with hand-picked officers, will look after the operations of the lab. 

 Besides equipping the men in uniform with tech knowledge, Nasscom will also supply tech tools to track Net-savvy criminals. 

 A forensic tool kit is a must to help officers collect data and help them build evidence. The officers also need certain software applications to analyse files without tampering with the evidence, said Vicky Shah, a Nasscom security expert. 

 The lab will be equipped to deal with issues like credit card fraud and Net extortion.

 A team from the countrys apex body of IT and IT services companies will arrive shortly in Calcutta to set up the lab and conduct training for CID officers.

 The local infotech industry has welcomed the CIDs decision to set up the lab, as most think that it would act as a deterrent. 

 It is, indeed, a much-needed move But along with the latest techniques, constant surveillance is a must to minimise cyber crime, said S. Radhakrishnan, president of Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

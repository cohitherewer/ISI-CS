 FTV has replaced cricket on the giant screens at the discs. SMS queries on live scores has slumped. Caf Coffee Day (CCD) outlets has swung back to usual hours. With the men in Blue certain to board the flight back from the Caribbean, the business bubble over the cricket craze has burst. 

 So, the CCD outlets remaining open and serving coffee till the last ball of the matches involving India have slipped back to their normal roster. 

 With Indias exit from the World Cup almost certain, very few would like to stay out at night to see other teams playing, said a spokesperson of the popular coffee shop chain. 

 During all the three group matches, footfall at CCD was way above normal days and the company officers were expecting it to continue at least till the knock-out stages. 

 We would be losing out on that extra revenue, added the spokesperson, ruing Indias early exit. 

 Though a miracle Bermudas win over Bangladesh can keep Indias World Cup hopes alive, the mood in the market is sombre. 

 If India is on a winning streak, families come out to watch the match on big screen and enjoy the session with food and drinks. But with India out of the World Cup so early in the tournament, that extra business is as good as gone, said a spokesperson of Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

 With World Cup as the theme, the hotel on AJC Bose Road had planned a number of cricket-cuisine-party combos for its guests. 

 As a lot of planning and preparations went into stitching together the promotional offers surrounding the showpiece cricket event, the offers will continue at HHI and most other night spots. 

 But the focus has already shifted from cricket crazy fans to party crowd. We will go ahead with our World Cup promotions. The footfall will be nothing over the top. It will be normal like any other day. The party crowd will definitely drop in, said a spokesperson for The Park Hotels.

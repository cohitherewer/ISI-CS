The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fakes flood racks and kerbs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The retail revolution in the city has spawned an industry of fakes. From perfumes to cellphones, counterfeits of branded goods are being sold on pavements and also in reputed stores. A luggage scam at Vishal Mega Mart last week only highlights the problem.

 B. Dey of Bineyog, which has been selling luggage in New Market since 1888, says: A signboard does not make one an authorised dealer. Our dealership certificate is framed and displayed. For imported brands, we make sure that we are dealing with the right kind of importer.

 According to him, customers should stay away from the grey market to avoid getting duped.

 Sanjay Sahoo of S.M. Trading, authorised dealer for Samsonite, American Tourister and Giordano, states: It is not easy to fool a dealer, but precautions need to be taken. It is not easy to fool the customer, either. But if he is looking for a branded product at a 20-30 per cent discount, he is ready to be duped.

 Shompa Mukherjee, customer care associate and services manager at Shoppers Stop, Forum, echoes Sahoo: It is difficult to fool the retailer as well as the customer unless they want to be fooled.

 Fakes are rampant among clothing sold on the pavement. T-shirts bearing the name and logo of brands like Nike and Adidas are available for as little as Rs 30 in front of New Market. Most buyers know the T-shirts are fake. Sometimes, however, counterfeits are indistinguishable from the originals. 

 A brand loyalist is likely to know the difference, feels Vijay Dugar, who runs Reebok and Levis stores in the city. The V-shaped design on the back pocket of Levis jeans is difficult to copy. Theres also a leather patch at the back. In the logo, the size of the horses and the space between them should be checked. Levi Strauss should be embossed on the buttons, he explains. 

 Counterfeiters do not make replicas to avoid legal action. Even the brand name can be misspelt. The price of a fake depends on its likeness to the original.

 Kamal Jain, who runs Nike and Adidas stores in Calcutta, stresses the importance of buying only from authorised dealers.

 We feel more betrayed when fakes are sold in large stores than in roadside stalls. We have conducted raids and caught the counterfeiters. But they go scot-free due to loopholes in the law, says Sanjeev Mohanty, director (sales and marketing) of Benetton India.

 Even childrens products are copied. Counterfeit clothes for kids may look just as good as the original, but the quality of the fabric and the fit will be below par, says Shiv Daswani of Little Shop at Forum.

 While most consumers try to avoid fakes, some prefer counterfeit and smuggled products to originals. Fancy Market and Five Star Market are among their favourite shopping destinations.

 Fake products of any brand, especially electronic goods, are available in Kidderpore. Counterfeit Nokia handsets that look exactly like the original ones are sold here. These handsets cannot be repaired, states a shopkeeper.

 Logos of brands like Philips and LG are put on media players, cameras and other gadgets and sold in Kidderpore. The electronic goods come from China, as well as Delhi and Mumbai, adds the shopkeeper.

 Fake perfumes are also popular. The perfumes are manufactured locally and poured into branded bottles, says another shopkeeper. But we do not sell counterfeit products to our loyal customers. It is a matter of trust, he adds.

 Cops dont know about data officer

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 S. Chakrabarty had filed a complaint with the Alipore sub-divisional magistrates court in 1999 regarding the possession of a flat. The court asked Karaya police station to probe the matter and file a report by March 2, 2005.

 The thana, however, chose to ignore the order. Chakrabarty tried to approach the information officer of the city police for updates on the case, but could not locate him in the headquarters. He finally moved a petition with the information commission last month.

 Achintya Banerjee had gone to Lalbazar to submit a petition for a piece of information early this month. But guards at the gate denied him entry, claiming there was no information officer in the force. He, too, had no option but to knock on the doors of the commission.

 Chakrabarty and Banerjee are not alone. Several others like them have failed to file petitions under the Right to Information (RTI) Act with the city police, just because most cops, including officers, at the headquarters are unaware of the existence of any information officer in the ranks.

 An officer in that capacity, however, does exist. Joint commissioner (operations) Sudhir Mishra, who is doubling as principal information officer (PIO), said: I dont know of any individual being unable to file a petition under the RTI Act. I regularly receive petitions for information. But some petitions are directed to me by the commission. I will definitely look into the matter.

 Though Mishra claimed everyone in the force was aware of the PIOs existence, the website of the city police carries no mention of him.

 Even officers in the public relations department pleaded ignorance when asked about the PIO.

 We are not aware of any such officer in the headquarters. The deputy commissioner (headquarters) must know, said an officer in the public relations department, who refused to be quoted.

 Isnt it funny to approach a senior officer like a deputy commissioner (headquarters) to know about the PIO? asked S. Khettry, member of the West Bengal RTI Manch that helps people file petitions under the act.

 People visiting Lalbazar know how difficult it is to meet these senior officers and how busy they are. Cops manning the entrance must be told about the PIO, so petitioners are not harassed, he added.

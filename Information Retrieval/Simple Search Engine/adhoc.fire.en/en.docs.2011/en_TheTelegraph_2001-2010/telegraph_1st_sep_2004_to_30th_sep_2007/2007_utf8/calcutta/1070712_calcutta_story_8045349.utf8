 Calcutta, with its dense and multi-layered urban fabric, could throw up a clutch of fascinating neighbourhoods into the Unesco world heritage sites roster, feels American Center director Douglas G. Kelly.

 A keen student of urban spaces, Kellys first brush with Calcutta was back in 1971, when he took a break from his Asian Studies course at Mysore University to explore the city during the Diwali holidays.

 I feel any number of quarters and precincts in this city, like Jorasanko and Dalhousie Square, can make it to the Unesco list, if these jewels are threaded into a splendid necklace, the American Center director points out.

 Having been to Calcutta a number of times since his 71 sojourn, Kelly has kept track of the citys evolution as best he could. When he returned last year after a decade-long hiatus for his current stint, he noticed a quantum jump in the number of vehicles and more retail and housing estates.

 As director, he promises to make access to the Center as smooth as possible, and keep the stream of myriad events flowing. 

 The American school will be flagged off on July 26, which has the potential to grow into a sprawling institution, given the growing demand for overseas modes of education, Kelly feels. We have seen it happen in Chennai and theres a lot of pent-up demand here as well, he says.

 Formal and informal linkages with US universities, like the one JU has with Virginia Tech, would also be encouraged.

 This month will also see Joseph Moreno, the professor emeritus at Maryville University, St Louis, arriving for workshops on Music as Therapy, and Ravi Kalia, the professor at City College, New York, speaking on urban architecture in Calcutta. Following the success of the Herbie Hancock-Wayne Shorter show at the DI last winter a last-minute coup by the American Center Calcutta The Rhythm Road Jazz All Stars quartet will be in town in end-August/early September.

 Of course Calcutta remains the most knowledgeable jazz city in the country and Hancock and Shorter both acknowledged the DI crowd was the best they played to in India. Nonetheless, theres no harm in exploring new genres, he observes. 

 Efforts are on to bring down The Slickee Boys, a popular punk/psychedelic rock band from Washington DC during the winter.

 Myth and modernism

 Although works of art in traditional mediums and styles are being produced now in India, we are reluctant to call them contemporary art because of their voluntary exemption from contemporaneity. Despite this exclusion, artists try to bridge the divide by adopting the modern and combining their traditional techniques with contemporary formats, thus bringing about a newfound order. Embracing Modernity, the ongoing solo show by Ramesh Gorjala of Andhra Pradesh, features works that assimilate his modernity into his traditional roots, creating a stylised format of painting. The themes he depicts are almost entirely mythological, being based on stories from the Puranas. His compositions consist of a principal figure, which he transforms into multiple narrative sequences associated to the main. The figure is merely a silhouette, a primary means of visual communication that determines the subject of the painting. A product of the shift in trend towards modernity, Gorjalas work responds to its time, at the same time maintaining its connection to the past and offering a way to go beyond a mere physical existence.

 Report clean chit for colas

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A long-standing debate on whether soft drinks contain pesticides might end. Tests conducted by the Public Health Laboratory have confirmed that pesticide content in Pepsi and Coke does not exceed the limit set by the National Experts Group.

 The report was submitted to Calcutta High Court by the state health department on Thursday.

 The tests were conducted after the high court had directed the state government on March 9 to ascertain whether the soft drinks available in the market contained pesticides or not.

 A division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya had ordered the tests, on a public interest litigation by Idris Ali.

 Pepsi and Coke are the most popular drinks. People should know about the ingredients. The court should ask the state to take steps in that direction, Ali had said during the hearing of his suit.

 However, green activist Subhas Dutta said the bottling of soft drinks by lifting groundwater should also be considered. 

 Kerala has banned the lifting groundwater while bottling the soft drinks. Our state should also take quick steps or we might face problems in future, he added.

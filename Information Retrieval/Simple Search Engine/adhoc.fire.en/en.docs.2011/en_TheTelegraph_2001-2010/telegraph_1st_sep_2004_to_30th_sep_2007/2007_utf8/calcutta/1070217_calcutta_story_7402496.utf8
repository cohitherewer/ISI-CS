 Royal guard missing at the plexes 

 - Distributor-exhibitor tiff over revenue-sharing hits latest Bachchan film

 Amitabh Bachchan has always been Calcuttas favourite but inadvertently, he may have not allowed the citys audiences to catch his latest, Eklavya: The Royal Guard at the plexes. 

 The Vidhu Vinod Chopra film, released on Friday, is playing only at the far-flung Fame (Hiland Park) multiplex with a no-show at the more popular other three plexes of the city INOX (Forum), INOX (City Centre) and 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi).

 While the city distributor (Jalan Distributors) and exhibitor (INOX now owns all the three plexes) are playing the blame game, it maybe the brand worth of Bachchan which may have cost Calcuttans a chance to watch Eklavya at a plex near them. If I get a 55 per cent share for the first week of a film like Kabul Express, why should I agree to 50 per cent for an Amitabh Bachchan film? asks Pritam Jalan of Jalan Distributors. Fame (Hiland Park) has agreed to terms set by Jalan.

 The exhibitors point of view is, of course, different. One of the general managers of the plexes, on the condition of anonymity, said: One cant change revenue percentages on the basis of distributors. If we agree to an elevated percentage for Eklavya, we have to pay at the same rate for any another Amitabh Bachchan film, for example Nishabd.

 While the distributor-exhibitor tiff over revenue-sharing is nothing new, this time it is exclusive to the city. We are not against playing the film and there have been negotiations and deliberations between Jalan and our Mumbai office all the time, reveals Vikas Syal, general manager of INOX (Forum). 

 Eklavya is more of a multiplex film and we would have definitely loved to play it, but the talks have failed till now.

 So, much like Fanaa last year, Eklavya is being shown only on single screens Hind, Menoka, Elite barring Fame (Hiland Park). And just like last year, the standalone theatres are making the most of it. 

 Says Pranab Ray, owner of Menoka: We usually have our stalls getting full first but for Eklavya, the balcony seats are getting filled first. This clearly shows that the usual plex audience is now coming to us.

 Distributor Jalan, too, is banking on the single screens. I get to keep 90 per cent of the share when it comes to the standalone theatres, he says. You can well figure out that if a film makes Rs 10 lakh in Week One, I get to keep just Rs 5 lakh from a plex and Rs 9 lakh from a single theatre. Now, for Eklavya, which is a two-hour film, we are running five shows a day at the single-screeners, thus getting an extra show every day.

 Inside sources say there is still a chance of Eklavya coming to the plexes. Till that happens, you may have to check out Eklavya with massy chants like Rashtrapati Amitabh Bachchanji ki jai ho!

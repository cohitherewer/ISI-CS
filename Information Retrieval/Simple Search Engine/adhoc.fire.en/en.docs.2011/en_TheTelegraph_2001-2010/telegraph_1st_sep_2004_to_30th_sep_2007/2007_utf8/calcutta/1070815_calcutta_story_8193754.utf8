 Central aid for drainage 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Centre will fund a third of a Rs 231-crore project to upgrade the citys drainage system, while the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will bear the rest of the cost, said finance minister Asim Dasgupta on Tuesday.

 Dasgupta had met Union urban development minister Jaipal Reddy in New Delhi earlier this week. 

 The state has also sought a central assistance of Rs 1,500 crore for an overhaul of the citys drainage system, along with another Rs 110 crore under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, said Dasgupta.

 Rainwater was not being drained into Kestopur canal as the level of water in it needs to be maintained to run the ferry service, he added. The chief secretary is coordinating with Hidco and the irrigation department in this regard.

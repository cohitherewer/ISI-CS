The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Plexes shun Bolly, big or small

 - Revenue-sharing row between exhibitor and distributor hits viewer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tanushree Dutta in Raqeeb: Missing at the plexes 

 Hooked on to the multiplex experience? Going to a standalone theatre is a strict no-no? Then be prepared to give Bollywood films big and small a miss at the movies.

 After turning their backs on Bollywood biggies from Fanaa last year to Ta Ra Rum Pum last month city plexes are now deciding to give small Hindi films a miss. A couple of months after Red released at single-screen addresses, Raqeeb is missing from this Fridays roster at the plexes.

 The official reason? We havent managed to find a slot for Raqeeb, says Saurabh Varma, vice-president, programming and distribution, INOX. The plex chain also owns the 89 Cinemas property. This week, we have Spider-Man 3 and Life in a Metro, and both are doing exceedingly well. So, we didnt want to tamper with the programming to accommodate a small film.

 That is, at best, half the story. What explains Ek Chalis Ki Last Local (Abhay Deol and Neha Dhupia) being given four shows and Raqeeb (Jimmy Sheirgill, Rahul Khanna, Sharman Joshi and Tanushree Dutta) not even one? 

 Or Good Boy Bad Boy enjoying two daily shows in Week 2 despite a poor opening, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a no-hype English film, being given two shows from Friday the 18th.

 The audience is being made the scapegoat because of the bad blood between the exhibitors and the distributors, alleges Pritam Jalan, who handles all the Yash Raj Films in Bengal. INOX is playing all movies at its properties in Mumbai, Bangalore and Indore. Its only in Calcutta that they can play these power games.

 INOX maintains that differences in the revenue-sharing percentage have stalled the screening of some big Bolly movies. And things have reached crisis point now. None of the upcoming blockbusters Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, Chak De India and Aaja Nachle will come to the multiplexes, warns Jalan. Unless there is a change in attitude, most distributors will stop doing business with the plexes here.

 Jalan can recover his costs at single-screen theatres like Hind and Menoka, but the smaller distributor is hit hard by the no-show. As is the viewer, for whom going to the plexes has become a way of life in the past three years.

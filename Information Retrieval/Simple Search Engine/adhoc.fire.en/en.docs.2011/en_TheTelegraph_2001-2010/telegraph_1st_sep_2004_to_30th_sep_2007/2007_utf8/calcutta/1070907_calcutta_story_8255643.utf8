 Judicial delay has turned a new car into a piece of junk.

 The Fiat Premier 118NE (WNC 6672) was locked for seven years in a Kankurgachhi garage following a dispute, still pending in Sealdah court, between its owner and that of the vehicle.

 A high court-appointed special officer, helped by 11 trained men, retrieved the dilapidated vehicle on July 4, 2007. It was covered with a thick coat of dust. The seats were layered with fungus and the tyres were all flat. The car was in no position to be driven out, said Chaitali Bhattacharya, the special officer.

 K.L. Gupta, the businessman who owns the car, had moved several pleas in Sealdah court since 2000 to appoint a special officer to break open the garage and recover the car.

 Not a single judge several had heard the petition over the seven years took the plea seriously. In fact, a judge had said that the heavens would not fall if the car remained in the locked garage for some more time, said Saswata G. Mukherjee, who appeared for Gupta in the high court.

 The car was worth Rs 4.5 lakh in 2000. Now, its value is zero. My client will move a fresh petition in the high court, demanding compensation from the garage owner, Sourindra Nath Chakraborty, Mukherjee added.

 Chakraborty, however, had all along denied that the car was in his garage. Gupta had claimed in his petition that he had taken Chakrabortys garage at 225 CIT Road on rent. According to the case diary, Chakraborty asked Gupta in March 2000 to vacate the garage. Gupta refused, following which Chakraborty filed an eviction suit in Sealdah court.

 While the suit was being heard, Gupta informed the court that Chakraborty had locked the garage with his vehicle inside. But Chakraborty claimed there was no vehicle in the garage. My client prayed several times for the appointment of an officer to verify his statement. But the court ignored his plea, prompting him to move the high court, said Mukherjee.

 After a single hearing, Justice Indira Banerjee of the high court appointed a special officer to break open the garage. She also observed that the lower court had been negligent in dealing with case.

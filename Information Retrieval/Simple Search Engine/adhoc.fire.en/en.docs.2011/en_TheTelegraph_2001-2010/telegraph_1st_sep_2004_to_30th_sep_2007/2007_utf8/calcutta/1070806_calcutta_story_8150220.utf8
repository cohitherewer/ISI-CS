Precision agriculture and air-pollution monitoring are two new areas receiving attention at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, this year.

 The institute is handling two pilot projects, one funded by MediaLab Asia and the other by the Centres information technology department, for designing, developing and implementing sensor-based wireless networks in agriculture and pollution monitoring.

 The objective of the one- year agriculture project is to watch parameters like temperature, humidity, rainfall and wetness of soil in real time for better management and maintenance of crops and their protection from severe attacks of diseases because of climatic conditions.

 The aim is to aid rural development with the latest technology. A lot of work is being done abroad on precision agriculture. We want to see how it works here, said Somprakash Bandyopadhyay, who teaches management information systems at IIM Calcutta.

 The estimated cost of the project, which started in April this year and will end next March, is Rs 34 lakh.

 The project will be implemented in a controlled environment. We are in talks with Kalyani University to see if it can be implemented there, said Bandyopadhyay, who is heading the projects.

 Work on the air pollution project started in June and will continue for 18 months. It will cost Rs 50.24 lakh. The objective is to monitor the level of air pollution in real time for protection of public spaces using a sensor-based wireless mesh network.

 The wireless sensor device will enable continuous online tracking of pollution levels not only in the city but also in industrial areas.

 Wireless mesh sensor networks offer new ways of monitoring air quality without expenditure on major new installations or wire-runs that are typically associated with such projects, said Bandyopadhyay.

 Such a system could also be very useful for disaster management in the chemical industry. The network of wireless sensors would be able to note changes in pollution level in such areas and sound an alert.

 The sensors can also identify the source of a leak, stated Bandyopadhyay. 

 The technology, after being tried out and implemented on lab scale, will be commercialised.

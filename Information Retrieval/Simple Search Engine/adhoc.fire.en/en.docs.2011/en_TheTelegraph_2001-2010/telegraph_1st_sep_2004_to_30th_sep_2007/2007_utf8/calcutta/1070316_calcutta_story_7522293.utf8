 Whisked away, missing

 - Gun-point getaway patient not to be found, clinic eyes beef-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police are yet to trace the patient or his relatives who wheeled him out of AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria, on Tuesday night, holding employees at gun-point. The group refused to pay the bill amounting to Rs 70,000.

 We will not let them go. Those involved in the incident will be tracked down and punished, an officer of Lake police station said on Thursday.

 The incident which has prompted the AMRI authorities to boost security on the premises was discussed by the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India on Thursday. 

 We want to take a strong stand on the issue and ask the government to take steps to ensure that such incidents do not recur, said an association spokesperson. 

 The patient, Sudip Kumar Singh, 23, a resident of Panchanantala Road, was admitted to the hospital on March 9 after he met with a road accident. According to the hospital authorities, he had suffered critical injuries in the face, neck, chest, hip and thigh, and multiple fractures in the right leg.

 Singh had to undergo several operations and a steel implant was fitted in the fractured leg.

 The hospital charged Rs 1.16 lakh for the treatment, of which Singhs relatives paid Rs 45,000. The rest they promised to pay on Wednesday morning, when Singh was scheduled to be released, said S.B. Purkayastha, president of AMRI Hospitals.

 But on Tuesday night, a armed gang stormed the hospital and whisked Singh away on a trolley from a second-floor general ward.

 The hospital is beefing up security. Additional guards will be deployed at night and sophisticated security gadgets installed, said Purkayastha. The gadgets will include an alarm system that will stop the lift operation and an automatic locking device for the main gate.

 Tuesday nights incident, however, is not the first of its kind in a private hospital. 

 A hospital that often faces such problems is CMRI. People claiming to be relatives of patients frequently pick quarrels with our staff over the bill, said Rupak Barua, chief operating officer of CMRI. On several occasions, the situation had gone out of hand, forcing us to seek police intervention.

 Mission of Mercy Hospital (earlier known as Assembly of God Church Hospital), too, faces similar situations regularly. We are often threatened to waive off the entire treatment cost, said Partha Bandyopadhyay, managing committee member of the hospital.

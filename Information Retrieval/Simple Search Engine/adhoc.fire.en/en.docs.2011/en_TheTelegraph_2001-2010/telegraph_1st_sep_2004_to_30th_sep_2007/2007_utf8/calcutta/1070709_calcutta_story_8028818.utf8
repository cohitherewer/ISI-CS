 Art and escapism

 Romanticism in contemporary art gets a fresh lease of life through the paintings of artists Pradip Chaudhuri and Chinmoy Chakraborty. The exhibition of paintings by the duo brings alive forgotten, forsaken emotions and sensibilities with a powerful, passionate zeal. The works on show reflect the artists intense romantic, fanciful tendencies, that consciously steer clear of the domain of the real world. Rich, vivid canvases in bright, bold tones attract viewers by their sheer pictorial beauty. At times, abstract and obscure in imagery, they nevertheless clearly convey an introspective strain of thought, bordering on the transcendental. Often, the paintings evoke feelings of escapism, of losing oneself in a secret, secluded abode where reality does not exist. Yet, there remains a subtle sensation that such escape is but ephemeral; reality beckons gently but steadily, summoning us back to where we rightfully belong.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by two artists When: June 9 - 14; 3 pm - 7 pm (Saturday, 10 am - 3 pm) Where: Chemould Art Gallery, 15F Park Street

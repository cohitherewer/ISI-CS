The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Son takes back mother

 - 90-YR-OLD GETS HOME

 A STAFF REPORTER

 HAPPY TO BE BACK: Manoda Roy, 90, is now back at her home on Shibpur Road, the house in which she lived with her husband. A Telegraph picture

 Ninety-year-old Manoda Roy found a home after 15 years. Her son has decided to have his mother back.

 The infirm woman was found sitting beside the rotting corpse of her 70-year-old daughter Kanaklata in Shibpur on May 31.

 Poverty prevented me from looking after my mother, said son Biren, 67. I have been without a job for the past 20 years and my family of four runs on the support of my brother-in-law.

 His neighbours have been taunting him since the day his mothers plight hit the headlines, said Biren.

 On Wednesday, he walked into Shibpur police station to take back his mother.

 Manoda and her daughter had lived as beggars in the streets of Shibpur Bazaar after Biren threw them out, allegedly at the instigation of his wife.

 After she was found sitting beside the corpse of her daughter, refusing to believe she was dead, officers of Shibpur police station sent her to live in a drug rehabilitation home.

 A resident of Delhi, S. Mehdi, sent a sari and Rs 500 to Manoda, after reading a Metro report on her plight. Shibpur police officers handed her the gift on Wednesday as her son helped her trace her route home.

 Biren had performed the last rites of his sister and promised to take care of his mother, said police officers.

 We realised that it was not proper to keep an old woman among drug addicts for long, said Samarendranath Das, inspector-in-charge, Shibpur police station. 

 Now that her son is giving her a home, we hope Manoda gets the comfort and rest she deserves, he said.

 Back home at 186 Shibpur Road, Manoda said: I am happy to be back in the house where I had lived with my husband. However, she is yet to know that elder daughter Kanaklata had died more than a week ago.

 Mystic modernism

 Gifted with a cerebral palette that can seamlessly blend the colours of fantasy and realism, Tapas Konar has given birth to a unique visual rhetoric, which, though inspired by ancient Bengali spiritual texts, is clearly original and contemporary. The ongoing exhibition of his recent drawings and paintings exemplifies his ability to invoke mythological associations only to load conceptual values to his images. The non-specific iconic images, reminiscent of known puranic and Buddhist icons which abound in his works, appear to be part of the fluid rhythm of his compositions. The use of a muted, overall ambient colour creates the perfect pictorial space helping the artist to take off into flights of fantasy. Konars images of genderless, translucent human figures in motion definitely indicate post-modern influences. He also employs his music-attuned senses to bind disparate segments of his paintings in a free-flowing strain, endowing his work with a rare musical quality.

 Event: Drawings and paintings by Tapas Konar 

When: Till January 31 (except Sunday), 3 pm - 8 pm

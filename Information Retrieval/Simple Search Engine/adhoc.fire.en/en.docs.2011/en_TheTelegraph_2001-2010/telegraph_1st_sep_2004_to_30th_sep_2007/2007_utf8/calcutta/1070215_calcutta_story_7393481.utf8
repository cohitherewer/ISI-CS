 Haute Street, Indias first-ever signature mall, coming up on the Park Circus connector next to Viswakarma, promises to bring a clutch of designer labels in first-time exclusive stores under one roof.

 We have already signed with Omega and Rado. Talks are on with brands like Zara, Versace, Mango and Swarovsky, Sujit Arya, director of The Surya Group, a consortium of the Rawalwasia and Arya groups developing the Topsia mall, said at the launch on Wednesday.

 The developers are in negotiation with Shoppers Stop, Pantaloons and Globus to finalise the anchor tenant. The 100,000-sq-ft mall, set to be ready by mid-2008, is spread across three levels, is wi-fi enabled and uses intelligent building management systems for energy conservation.

 In the food and beverage segment, the group has signed with Subway for a 1,000-sq-ft outlet. Talks are also on with McDonalds. Efforts are on to bring some of the Chinatown eateries into the mall to offer typical Chinese fare in a contemporary and organised setting. 

 We want to bring all the big names together for the convenience of the brand-conscious consumers who are well aware of what they want and make shopping a pleasurable experience for them, added J.P. Rawalwasia, another director of the group.

 According to Harsh Sanon, principal architect of Sanon Sen and Associates doing the design solution for Haute Street, the idea of a signature mall is about setting high standards of excellence in architecture, structure and faade. The BMS (building management system) will help keep the entire building clean, provide water management and reduce maintenance costs, claim the developers.

 The entire corridor along the Park Circus Connector is being energised with large-format stores like Steel Junction, the Emirates office and all the hotels coming up. Haute Street has great synergy with the flow of this development and is set to become a shop-eat-hangout destination, observed Abhijit Das, regional director of property consultants Trammell Crow Meghraj.

 Haute Street will host activities round the year. There is a planned commercial area within the mall itself for in-store and in-mall promotion of brands and retail-linked events. Besides the quick-service combos and a lounge bar, there will be a relaxed-dining section. 

 Fashionwear, gifts, jewellery, accessories, home furnishing, consumer durables, footwear and kidswear will be some of the other categories showcased at the mall. 

 Pinnacle, an adjacent office block, will house parking for 225 cars, and boast a double-height, premium-finish air-conditioned lobby with concierge, a cafeteria, a captive business centre with conference facility and a health club.

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The OBC quota issue and the impending fee hike at the Indian institutes of management (IIMs) will be among the topics to be discussed on the Joka campus, which hosts the 19th Annual Convention of the Association of Indian Management Schools (Aims).

 S.M. Datta, the chairman of Philips India, inaugurated the convention on Thursday. It will continue till Saturday. The theme for the convention is Emerging India: Strategic Transformation of Indian Industry and Management Education.

 The convention aims to deliberate upon how the management institutions should help the government achieve economic growth, said Shekhar Chaudhuri, the director, IIM Calcutta, and president of Aims.

 The convention brings together industrialists, academics, policy-makers and administrators, who will hold forth on issues related to management education, meritocracy and more.

 Speakers include P.G. Apte, the director of IIM Bangalore, Samuel Paul, the chairperson of the Public Affairs Centre, and S.L. Rao, the chairman of the board of governors, Institute for Social and Economic Change.

 A compromise on the fees would mean compromising on the quality of education, said Uday Salunkhe, the vice-president of Aims, setting the tone for things to come.

 Other speakers at the convention include J.J. Irani, the director of Tata Sons, Roopen Roy, the managing director of Deloitte and Touche Consulting India, and Sabyasachi Hajara, the chairman and managing director of Shipping Corporation of India.

 Students and faculty members will present research papers during the convention. This will boost research orientation among the students, said Chaudhuri.

 C. Rangarajan, the chairman of the economic advisory council of the Union government, will be given the Ravi J. Mathai National Fellowship Award for his contribution to management.

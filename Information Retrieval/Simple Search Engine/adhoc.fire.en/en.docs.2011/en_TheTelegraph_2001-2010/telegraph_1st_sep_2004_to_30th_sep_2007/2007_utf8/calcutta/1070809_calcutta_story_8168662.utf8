The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 LRT along tram tracks

 - LAND NOT REQUIRED

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has told the Centre that it will not need to acquire land for the Rs 3,600-crore Light Rail Transit (LRT) project.

 In central and south Calcutta, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Wednesday, the advanced mass transit corridor will run along the tramlines.

 From Diamond Harbour Road, the route follows the tram tracks to Esplanade and Moulali, via Lenin Sarani. At Moulali, the alignment heads for Shyambazar, via College Street, again along the tramlines. From Shyambazar, it runs through the middle of BT Road till Panihati (not Barrackpore, as had been envisaged).

 The trains will run at a height of 16 metres from the ground and will not hamper traffic, said Bhattacharya.

 Bhattacharya discussed the LRT and other transportation projects with Union urban development minister Jaipal Reddy during his recent visit to Delhi. The state wants the Centre to fund 35 per cent of the cost under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission.

 We have prepared a master plan, which will be produced before transportation advisers and other experts of the Union ministry, said Bhattacharya.

 In response to the Centres queries, the state government said the LRT will ferry more than 13,000 passengers an hour during peak time. The trains will be 90 metres long and run at five-minute intervals, the minister said.

 Besides the LRT, the state is also expecting funds for the proposed Park Circus flyover, extension of EM Bypass from Paddapukur to Kamalgazi, Vivekananda Road flyover and the ramps on the AJC Bose flyover.

 The projects are mentioned in the citys transportation and mobility master plan submitted to the Centre.

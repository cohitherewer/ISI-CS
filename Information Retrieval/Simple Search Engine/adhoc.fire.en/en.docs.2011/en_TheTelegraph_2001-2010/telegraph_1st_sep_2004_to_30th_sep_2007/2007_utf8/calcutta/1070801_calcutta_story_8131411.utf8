 When the then President of India S. Radhakrishnan inaugurated a publishing house in August 1957, he was laying the seeds of a dream of a book-loving nation dreamt by the countrys first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Today that dream is a 50-year-old reality called National Book Trust (NBT).

 The golden jubilee of NBT, an autonomous entity under the human resource and development ministry, is being celebrated across the country. NBT in Delhi is now hosting a two-day seminar at the India International Centre, deliberating on the challenges and prospects of Indian publishing in the new millennium, from rural readership to e-marketing.

 Eight books will be released there as will a special cover stamp to mark the occasion. In Calcutta, on Thursday, a reading session will be held at Presidency College with participation of poets, essayists and novelists writing in diverse languages Marathi (Indrajit Bhalerao), Oriya (Ranjita Nayak), Assamese (Nilin Kumar), Maithili (Vidyanand Jha), Urdu (Qaiser Shamim), Hindi (Anamika) and Bengali (Subodh Sarkar). 

 We publish in 18 languages. Which other publisher brings out titles regularly in Garo, Khasi, Bhutia, Nepali and even Braille? says Bratin Dey, NBTs assistant editor in charge of publications in Bengali.

 The reason behind this is the aim of the publishing house to rise beyond commercial considerations and provide bridges for dialogues between the various languages recognised by the Constitution and fill critical gaps in the availability of essential literature. We have 250 releases per year of which a large number are translations.

 Other focus areas of NBT are the neo-literates and children. If the latter were favourites with Nehru, he was equally concerned with spreading the reading habit at the grassroots. Hence we have series for children and on creative learning.

 Another popular series is biography, as a part of which a book on veteran journalist Vivekananda Mukhopadhyay was brought out at Bangla Akademi on Tuesday.

 Come September, and the NBT even plans to organise a national seminar on childrens literature in Calcutta.

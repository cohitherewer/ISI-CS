 A Bergman classic

 Being screened this evening as part of Bergman Evenings with Samik Bandyopadhyay, is Fanny and Alexander, perhaps, one of the filmmakers most successful works. Steering away from the pain, neuroses and heavy metaphysical questions showcased in his earlier films, Bergman created Fanny and Alexander (a scene from the film appears right) based on his childhood memories of the turn of the 20th century. It begins with the Ekdahl familys Christmas celebration, their large home serving as the meeting place for a merry celebration by family members and servants. Ten-year-old Alexanders charmed life is suddenly shattered when his actor-manager father suffers a heart attack and dies, leaving the widow to be calmed by an understanding bishop whom she eventually marries. She takes her two children, Fanny and Alexander, away from their warm family into the cold, strict world of the clergyman. Not only does Bergman manage to capture in the film the flavour and atmosphere of a Swedish town of 1907, he expertly reveals events as seen through the eyes of a child and, without any wordy dissertations on doctrines, makes a powerful statement against religious zealotry. A magical movie, it is likely to be one of the major reasons for which Bergman will be most remembered.

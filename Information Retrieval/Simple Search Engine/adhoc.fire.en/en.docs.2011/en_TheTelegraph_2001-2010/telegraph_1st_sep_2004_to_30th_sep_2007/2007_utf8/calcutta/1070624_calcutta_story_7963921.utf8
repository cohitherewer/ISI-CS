The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Off the Formula track

 The city was set to be F1-ready. But its dreams to host the big event went up in smoke, reports Anasuya Basu

 If Suresh Kalmadi has his way, Hamilton and Massa may roar their way through New Delhi quite soon. Formula One is looking for new venues especially those in booming economies and the capital might just be the first Indian city to host an F1 event. 

 Kalmadi, the Indian Olympic Association president, has a conditional offer from Formula One to stage a Grand Prix in Delhi in 2009. He might just be able to get Formula One Administration (FOA) boss Bernie Ecclestone to sign the contract for this huge money-spinning mega event. 

 While New Delhi seems to have come close to Formula One glory, the Calcutta story is quite different. 

 From 1998 to 2002, there was a serious bid to bring Formula One to the city. The media, the government and sports bodies had debated on how the Grand Slam of motor racing could be brought to Bengal. The man behind the effort was a Calcuttan Anwar Salim. A London-based professional, Salim, along with Michael Taub, formed Grand Prix India Plc, the promoters for F1 in the city. 

 But was Calcutta, where traffic moved at 5 km per hour, if at all, really ready to host Schumacher and Hakkinen roaring at 300 kmph way back in 2002?

 The Grand Prix promoters in the city say the government was moving on a war-footing to put everything in place. Nine years ago, as deputy chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has other dreams too for the state that may have backfired, was the home minister. He then made Formula One his own baby.

 The chief minister was the visionary and his leadership was key to the progress the project was making, says Ravi Kumar, chairman of Calcutta Motor Sports Club and a member of the West Bengal Motor Sports Council, a body formed by the state government to facilitate the project. 

 Land for the F1 spectacle had been identified and the process of acquisition started. The F1 tracks are a high-tech road surface that the racing cars can utilise to generate maximum cornering and straight-line speed and torque. 

 Herman Tilke, head of Tilke Engineering Gmbh, the company responsible for F1 tracks worldwide, including the newly built Bahrain track, had done a recce of Rajarhat and approved of the land, says Kumar. The contractors were Morrisons of Scotland and Indian subcontractors were Larsen and Toubro.

 A motor sports council had also been formed, and an MoU between the promoters and the government signed. 

 Apart from the tracks, an F1 city also needs space for half a dozen jumbo jets to park, 5,000 five-star hotel rooms, trailer trucks to carry the racing cars and their crew adequate infrastructure to host the worlds glam frat that would descend in the city for the race at hand. 

 Though the state government went on top gear to bring Formula One to Rajarhat, it was the Centres ban on tobacco advertising that stalled all efforts.

 The Centre banned tobacco companies from promoting any kind of sport and British American Tobacco, the sponsors of the F1 Grand Prix in India, who had pledged $75 million, withdrew. The same ban is due to come into force worldwide in 2009, but New Delhi can look at other industries for sponsorship. 

 However, New Delhis bid still remains tentative there are tough conditions, including commercial agreements like the delivery to the FOA of a suitable standby letter of credit no later than September 30, 2007.

 The actual challenge lies in getting the infrastructure in place. What we can do is help the government with our technical expertise, says the president of the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, Rajat Majumdar. 

 The FOA is keen on tapping India, after holding races in Southeast Asia, including Sepang. The 2008 calendar includes circuits in Turkey, Singapore, Valencia and China.

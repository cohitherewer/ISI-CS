 Thirty-six hours after the Tuesday morning drencher and 12 hours after the Tuesday night downpour, several streets of the city remained waterlogged and its residents marooned. From Behala and New Alipore to Topsia and Park Circus to Amherst Street and Ultadanga, the question of why the water refused to recede stumped residents, commuters and civic officials, too.

 The situation was not so bad last time (June 13). The water had receded by the next day. This time, we dont know what has gone wrong in the sewerage system of the Ultadanga area, confessed the acting chief engineer (drainage and sewerage), Tushar Ghosh, on Wednesday afternoon.

 That summed up the precision with which the civic machinery swung into action to rid the city of its waterlogging woes on Wednesday. As the civic authorities floundered in the face of a crisis, some 80 pumps were pressed into action and 45,000 cusecs of accumulated water was drained out, but it amounted to little in several waterlogged pockets.

 Mechanical and electrical engineers were despatched to pumping stations, a special team of engineers headed by the chief engineer (project and development), Nilangshu Bose, was formed to tackle emergencies at pumping stations, all 19 pumping stations were brought under the control of the chief engineer (electrical), Pradip Jyoti Biswas, and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya surveyed flood-hit Behala without getting his feet wet.

 Metro picks some frequently-asked questions by Calcuttans on Wednesday and brings you the ground reality...

 Q: Why are streets waterlogged even hours after the rain stops?

 A: Collapse in the brick sewer at places, silted outflow channels, choking caused by polythene and solid waste, malfunctioning of pumps, lack of planning and coordination.

 Q: Which are the worst-affected areas in Calcutta?

 A: Madan Mohan Burman Street, Thanthania, Amherst Street, Topsia-Tiljala and Behala.

 Q: Where do I call if I am marooned?

 A: The CMC control room (22861212/1313).

 Q: Is the CMC to blame for the waterlogging?

 A: Though a number of departments, like fisheries and irrigation, are involved in drainage of water, the buck stops with the CMC.

 Q: How much rainfall can the sewerage system in Calcutta sustain?

 A: More than 130 years ago, the British designed Calcuttas sewer system to cope with 16 mm rainfall per hour. The capacity now has dropped to 6 mm rainfall an hour, due to lack of maintenance over the past 50 years.

 Q: Will the next monsoon be any better for us?

 A: It will be better for places where drainage revamp work will be completed by May 2008. The city as a whole will not see much improvement till the monsoon of 2009.

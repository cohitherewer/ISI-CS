 This is art as lifestyle accessory bronze sculptures that are small and easy to handle, perfectly finished, cross-cultural and picturesque. 

 To be on display at 85 Lansdowne from April 13 to 16, the limited edition pieces by artists Elizabeth (from Ireland) and Jorn (from Denmark) could add an aesthetic touch to the living room. The sculptures are priced between Rs 25,000 and Rs 90,000.

 With this show of 20 bronze pieces, 85 Lansdowne hopes to provide its clientele a chance to pick up art along with designer apparel. Rita Bengani who runs the Indian Art World website is collaborating with the boutique to showcase the works of famous and upcoming artists.

 Bengani said Indian sculptors dont keep the market needs in view. So instead of the cumbersome, badly finished and high-priced Indian sculpture, she is showcasing the works of Elizabeth and Jorn, whom she met in Scandinavia.

 The duo collaborates in figurative bronze pieces, which, thanks to their frequent travels, are conversations between different cultural, historical and mythic traditions. Often finished with gold and antiquated silver leaf and green and brown patina these have been brought out in sets of 15 to 375 signed pieces. 

 Rounded smooth forms broken by flowing lines and rough textures, they present images not unfamiliar to the Indian psyche.

 A meditating figure in a diya-shaped boat on a base like rippling water is called Now. A glittering Apsara mask has one perfect and one imperfect eye. Myths are resurrected in items like the Celtic mask of Danu, the goddess of abundance after whom the river Danube is said to be named, and Mae Toranee, who nourished the earth.

 A sculpture with a social message is that of an embracing couple. Unlike Rodins couple, this one seems keen on allowing Spaces In Between.

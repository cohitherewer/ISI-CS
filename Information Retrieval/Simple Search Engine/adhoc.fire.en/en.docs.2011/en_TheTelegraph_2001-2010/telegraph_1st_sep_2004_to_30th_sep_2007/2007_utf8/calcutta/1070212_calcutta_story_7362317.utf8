Salve for burns patients

 A burns patient receives treatment at the hydrotherapy unit

 Sirajullah Islam watched helplessly as ferocious flames licked his wifes body and their five-month-old child wailed in the cot next to the makeshift kitchen.

 The pump stove she was cooking on had burst and before 20-year-old Tahmina Bibi could even realise, she had sustained 70 per cent burns. Only a skin transplant could save her life, and she got that kiss of life from husband Siraj.

 Recovering from his stupor, the small-time kirana vendor from Noapara, in Barasat, rushed his wife to the nearby Kalpataru Hospital, which has a dedicated burns unit, and offered to donate his own skin for the critical transplant the doctors advised.

 It was amazing that the husband came forward, and we could do a live donation transplant, said Manish Mukul Ghosh, consultant plastic and recontructive surgeon, who performed the procedure at the Barasat hospital on Tuesday last.

 Ghosh and his team did a sandwich grafting on Tahmina, a combination of the patients own skin and the donated skin. The surgeon first removed 10 per cent of the body surface of Siraj. The skin was then put into a mesher and expanded in a 1:2 ratio, before being applied to the recipient.

 The message here is that skin can be donated, can be a life-saving gift and a permanent solution in serious burns. But theres little awareness on the issue, laments Ghosh.

 He and his team from First Trust Healthcare Pvt Ltd has set up the citys first dedicated burns unit with an integrated approach at the Barasat unit.

 Skin for grafting in a burns case is ideally harvested from a dying patient or from the cadaver, like cornea or bone collection. Live donation pattern is usually from parent to child, but most often, the amount of skin available for transplantation is woefully inadequate.

 To address that, we are trying to set up a skin bank, which will be the fourth in the country, says Ghosh. The global survival rate for 70 per cent-plus burn cases is now very high, thanks to advancement in skin-transplantation procedures and adequate stocks in skin banks.

 Treatment cost in burns cases escalates primarily because of the need for isolation. Instead, we want to do ward-based treatment and our burns ward at Kalpataru has a bacteria filter to ventilate the entire ward, which reduces chances of infection, adds Satadal Saha, managing director, First Trust Healthcare.

 With a clean air system, carefully controlled antibiotic regimen and nutrition, and intensive therapy when required, we can cut down cost to patient and achieve an 80 per cent-plus survival rate, Ghosh says.

 Against a standard cost of around Rs 1 lakh per week at any leading private hospital, Kalpataru promises a weekly expenditure of Rs 20,000, with the aim to further whittle it down to Rs 15,000.

 The focused burns team of First Trust comprises nursing stuff, physiotherapist, nutritionist, psychotherapist, burns surgeon, intensivist and anaesthetist. We also have a hydrotherapy unit, says Rosina Ahmed, gastrointestinal surgeon and part of the First Trust core team.

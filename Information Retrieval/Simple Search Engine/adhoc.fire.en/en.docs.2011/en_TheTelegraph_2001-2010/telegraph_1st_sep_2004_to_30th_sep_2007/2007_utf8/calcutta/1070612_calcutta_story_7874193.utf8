 Agency post to hasten projects

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will appoint a coordinating officer to speed up projects supported by central funds.

 The lack of coordination among various executing agencies has been delaying projects undertaken with funds from the Centres Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, a CMDA official admitted.

 The Centre had repeatedly expressed its displeasure over the tardy implementation of projects being funded by the mission in the state.

 State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya met his central counterpart Jaipal Reddy in Delhi last month to finalise the coordinating officers appointment.

 We have decided to appoint an official who will coordinate the projects and ensure they meet the deadline, Bhattacharya said. 

 The urban renewal mission has given its administrative and financial approval to water supply works worth Rs 600 crore. 

 It has also sanctioned Rs 300 crore for the construction of three flyovers.

 The City Diary

 Swapan Das, a leaseholder of the SSKM Hospital eatery where two men were charred to death on Friday, is absconding. Police raided the three houses of Swapan in Salt Lake, Entally and Madhyamgram but he could not be traced. His wife and children, too, are missing.

 Two CESC workers were assaulted by some goons late on Saturday while they were trying to restore supply in Sarkar Lane and Tarak Pramanik Lane in central Calcutta. Both workers were admitted to Medical College and Hospital. Two men have been arrested. 

 Trouble broke out at Bhatpara State General Hospital in Barrackpore on Sunday afternoon, following the death of a patient, Shyamal Gopal. Relatives alleged that Gopal died because of the hospital authorities negligence. According to a complaint, Gopal died immediately after a Group D employee administered him an injection.

 The employees of a private hospital on EM Bypass organised an agitation on the premises on Sunday. A member of the employees union said the hospital management was harassing and threatening them. She said the union will be forced to call a strike if the authorities do not call a meeting to discuss proposals on improving the working condition at the hospital. An official of the hospital, however, said the allegation was baseless.

 A 60-year-old man was injured when a truck knocked him down in the south port area early on Sunday. Local residents took him to SSKM Hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical. Police are yet to trace the vehicle.

 Laltu Das, a resident of East Jadavpur, was arrested on Sunday evening for allegedly molesting a three-year-old girl. According to police, Laltu asked the girl to accompany him on Sunday afternoon after luring her with a chocolate bar. The youth took the girl, who lives in a roadside shanty, to a hideout and allegedly molested her. The girl went crying to her mother. She lodged a complaint with East Jadavpur police station. The police picked up Laltu from a roadside tea stall.

 Forty too many 

 eyewitness

 A work by Abdul Salam on display at Aakriti Art Gallery 

 Aakriti Art Gallery celebrates its second anniversary with a huge exhibition opening on Tuesday entitled GenNextII, in which the works of 40 young artists from Bengal and from outside the state are being displayed. Culling the works of 40 artists from a host of newcomers is not a joke. Even more formidable is the task of displaying these. The number of exhibits could have been pared down. It would have allowed viewers to discover the artists who show promise more easily.

 While many of them were quite obviously inspired by their successful seniors, there were some who show the signs of having minds of their own. Arya Oraw was born in 1981 in Chakdaha, a few stations away from Sealdah. His structural assemblages of iron scrap are jagged and angular, and are innovative in the way junk is used to create a staccato rhythm that is quite unlike the sweetly romantic curves of our sculpture today.

 Abdul Salam was born in 1971 in Calcutta, and his etchings are spare in their use of bright shades and make good use of blank white space. His images look startling because they are commonplace.

 Nobina Gupta, born in 1972 in Jabalpur is exhibiting huge pen-and-ink drawings on paper and allude to the process of fertilisation by spermotozoa. Perhaps she should have used diagrams of the creative process a little more imaginatively.

 Balaka Bhattacharjee has improved a lot since she first began to exhibit her paintings while her father, Bikash Bhattacharjee, was still around. The idea behind the woman covering herself with the land she loves so much may have a streak of originality but the execution is shoddy.

 Next time the gallery holds an exhibition of young artists, it should unsparing while separating wheat from chaff. Dipak Kundus lurid nudes do not deserve to be seen.

 Tucked away behind Coffee House on Chittaranjan Avenue is big wedding cake of a building known as GC Laha House, belonging to the best-known seller of paints in the city. Tucked away in the right hand corner of this building is their art gallery, a neat little space which should be utilised for holding good exhibitions. The just-concluded exhibition of the calligraphic work of Poosapati Parameshwar Raju of Hyderabad was a revelation.

 One is familiar with the pictograms created by calligraphists when the language is either Urdu or Arabic. But never before has such beautiful calligraphic work in which the Devanagari script has been used seen in this city. Poosapati uses either sepia or maroon ink to create arabesques and whorls and sinuous curves to conjure up images of Hindu deities, various configurations to create aum and plants. Poosapati has studied Hindu iconography but it needed a leap of imagination to visualise Hanuman, leaping flames and the head of Vishnu. The best examples have the severity of Islamic calligraphy and the flourishes are kept to a minimum as in Shivaparvati and Mahanandi, Ananta Sayana and Ganesha (picture right). The more fanciful ones would appeal to popular tastes as the gods and goddesses are clearly depicted. Words do have the power to communicate and perhaps Hamlet would have changed his opinion had he seen Poosapatis word pictures.

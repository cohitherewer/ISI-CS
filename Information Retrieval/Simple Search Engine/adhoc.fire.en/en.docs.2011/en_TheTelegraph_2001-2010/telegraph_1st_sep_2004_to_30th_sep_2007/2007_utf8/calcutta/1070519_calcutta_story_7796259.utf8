 Woman accuses doctor of assault 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 60-year-old patient has accused a doctor of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital of hitting her.

 Kanak Roy, a resident of Harish Chatterjee Street, in south Calcutta, visited the outpatients department of the hospital on Friday morning. She entered a room to ask where she would be administered an injection. 

 The doctor sitting in the room, Ashish Kundu, allegedly hit her and misbehaved with her.

 Roys elder daughter Manju lodged a complaint against the doctor with the hospital authorities.

 Roy suffered food poisoning last Saturday. She was administered an injection at the hospital, but has since been suffering from a skin infection. She went back to the hospital on Friday for treatment.

 The doctor in room 12 examined me and told me to go to room 4 for an injection, she said. I entered a room in which a doctor was sitting and asked for directions to room 4. 

 Instead of replying, the doctor allegedly struck Roy, felling her to the ground. 

 I was bleeding from the mouth and was hurt in the chest. The doctor shouted that he did not know where I could get the injection administered, she said.

 Kundu, who is a part of the anti-rabies unit, told us that he hadnt meant to hit her and it was an accident, said a hospital official.

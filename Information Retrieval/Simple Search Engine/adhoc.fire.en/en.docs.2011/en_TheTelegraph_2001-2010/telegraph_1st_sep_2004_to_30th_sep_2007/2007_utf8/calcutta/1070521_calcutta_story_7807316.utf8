The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Writers says no to Japan bank study

 Think big, dont merely tweak

 Get local experts to solve local problems

 The state governments message to the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is loud and clear.

 The government has rejected a report by the international funding agency on the citys transport network and asked it to go back to the drawing board.

 The JBIC will consider allotting a loan for the revamp of the transport system after the Special Assistance for Project Formulation study to work out the feasibility.

 We have told the JBIC that improving a few intersections in Calcutta will not do much for the transport network. Unless the key entry and exit points are improved and strengthened, our transport problems will persist, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury on Sunday.

 Padeco, the consultants appointed by the Japanese agency, had taken the help of Mumbai-based SPAN for the study. The Mumbai consultants do not know much about the citys transport system. We have asked the JBIC to take the help of Calcutta-based consultants CES, which understands the citys ground realities, said an official of the transport department.

 The officials also felt that the JBIC had focussed on small changes instead of an overhaul of the system. 

 According to transport officials, the government wants to give top priority to the main thoroughfares, including widening of VIP Road from six lanes to 10 lanes. It also wants to extend EM Bypass to Baruipur. 

 Other key changes suggested include revival of the Vivekananda Road flyover project and addition of three flanks to the AJC Bose Road flyover. The Vivekananda Road flyover will connect Howrah with Chittaranjan Avenue, while the flanks of the other flyover will extend to Hospital Road, Vidyasagar Setu and Belvedere Road. 

 The state also wants flyovers at Chiria More, Sinthee More and the Tobin Road intersection on BT Road to prevent congestion due to increased traffic after the opening of the Second Vivekananda Bridge in early June.

 If the JBIC agrees to sanction a loan of Rs 1,000 crore for improving the citys transport network, these are the projects we want to implement on a priority basis. Weve sought details of these projects, added Chowdhury. 

 The transport department asked the JBIC to draft another report after a meeting with the top brass of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Calcutta Police last week.

 In its report, the Japanese agency had suggested removal of bottlenecks on important roads with the help of overbridges and underpasses. It recommended construction of nine bridges over railway tracks and widening of six underpasses under the tracks. 

 The agency also suggested the integration of Circular Railway and Metro services with the bus network through interchanges and feeder services and improvement of passenger dispersal at major terminals.

 Kin shun swapped corpse

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police are unsure of what to do with the body of Krishna Ghosh, a Lake Town resident who drowned, because his family keeps refusing to accept the corpse after it had been swapped on June 27. 

 The body is lying in the morgue of Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital for the past six days, with no claimants, police said. 

 We will have to think of our course of action, said the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Pradip Chatterjee.

 Krishnas relatives refused to give blood samples to the police for a DNA test. The cops will make a false report and force us to take the body of some other person, said a relative.

 The bodies of Krishna and Uttam Das, a Kasba resident who was run over by a train, were swapped on June 27. 

 Krishnas body was reportedly handed over to Uttams relatives, who returned it to the morgue. But Krishnas son Sanjay said it was not the body of his father. 

 We have checked that all other bodies which came to the morgue on June 27 had been identified by their respective family members. Only Krishnas family members refused to accept the body, said Chatterjee.

 We will inform Krishnas family members for the last time and if they refuse to accept the body, we will wash our hands of the affair. The only option remaining is to dispose of it, said an officer of Entally police station.

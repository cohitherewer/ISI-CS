 Decibel reprieve for camp

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court delivered a special order on Monday, allowing an organisation to use loudspeakers in a controlled manner for a yoga camp to be held at Rabindra Sarobar stadium from March 21 to 26.

 Yoga guru Baba Ramdev is scheduled to attend the camp.

 While announcing the verdict, the division bench of Justice P.K. Ghosh and Justice B. Somadder clarified: The order will not be a used as a precedent.

 The organisers, Viswa Jagriti Milan Chakra, had moved a petition in the high court, seeking permission to use loudspeakers for a the camp.

 The camp organisers can use loudspeakers under permissible limit (60 decibel) from 7 am to 9 am and from 5 pm to 7 pm, during the yoga sessions, the bench ruled.

 The judges held that as there is no educational institution around the stadium, the petitioner was allowed to use the loudspeakers.

 The court order followed a petition by the organisation challenging the validity of a state government notification prohibiting the use of loudspeakers during the school-leaving examinations.

 The division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice K.K. Prasad had rejected the petition.

 The organisation then moved the Supreme Court against the high courts decision. The apex court had sent the matter back to the high court for reconsideration.

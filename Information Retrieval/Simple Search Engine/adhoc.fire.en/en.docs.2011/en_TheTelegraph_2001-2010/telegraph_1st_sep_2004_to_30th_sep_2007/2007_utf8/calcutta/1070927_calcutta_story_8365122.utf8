 The Publishers and Booksellers Guild is back at the chief ministers door, seeking support for holding Book Fair 2008 on the Maidan.

 After being rebuffed by the army thrice, the Guild made yet another attempt last week to organise the fair on the Maidan by writing to defence minister A.K. Anthony.

 Guild general secretary Tridib Chatterjee, who visited Writers Buildings on Wednesday, said he was expecting the chief minister to support the Guilds plea to Anthony.

 The Guild, however, has made advance booking of four venues to keep Book Fair 2008 on track it is scheduled to start on January 7.

 The options are Park Circus Maidan, Milon Mela (off the EM Bypass), Rabindra Sarobar stadium and the Shahid Minar grounds.

 We will sit with the chief minister on October 3 or 4 to decide on the final venue, said Chatterjee.

 The state commerce and industry department has urged the Guild to hold the fair on Milon Mela.

 Industry minister Nirupam Sen has assured us that Milon Mela will be ready by January. He has asked us to organise the fair there. But we will take a decision only after hearing from the chief minister, said Chatterjee.

 For the fair to start on January 30, the Guild would need to take over the grounds on January 7 for preparatory work. The theme for next years fair is the US. Scotland will be guest of honour.

 The Guild has written to the armys Eastern Command authorities in Fort William thrice for hosting the fair on the Maidan. While the first letter drew a curt no from Fort William, there has been no response to the two later pleas.

 This year, the fair was held at Salt Lake stadium after the high court made the Maidan out of bounds for the Guild for environmental reasons.

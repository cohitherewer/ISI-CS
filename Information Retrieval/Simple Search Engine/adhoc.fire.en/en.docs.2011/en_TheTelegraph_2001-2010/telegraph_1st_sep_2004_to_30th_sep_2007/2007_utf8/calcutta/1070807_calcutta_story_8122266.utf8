 Hip surgery hope

 - Minimal incision minimises complication

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Those suffering from chronic pain and destructive arthritis in their hip joint can look forward to a better life, with advanced surgical techniques and implant equipment reaching Calcutta.

 According to orthopaedic surgeons, more young people in India require hip replacement than in the West. This, the surgeons feel, increases the importance of advanced methods of operation and implants to ensure the patient does not need a redo surgery.

 A patient can lead a normal life after hip replacement through minimal invasive surgery. There are no restrictions in even playing tennis or skiing, said Jens G. Boldt, an orthopaedic surgeon from Dusseldorf, Germany. He was in the city to conduct a live surgery workshop at Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI).

 Minimal invasive surgery, which till recently was being used mostly for knee replacement, is now being increasingly used for hip replacement as well. Since the new techniques require smaller incisions compared to the conventional method, duration of surgery and recovery is shorter. There is not as much post-surgery complication.

 Buddhadeb Chatterjee, an orthopaedic surgeon at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, said the incision for minimal invasive hip replacement is 6-8 cm in comparison to 15-20 cm for conventional surgery. The patient is usually released on the third day after the surgery, said Chatterjee.

 Chandrasekhar Dhar, an orthopaedic surgeon with CMRI, said smaller incision means less damage to tissues. Also, the new metal on metal large head implant is being used for replacement of the hip bone, said Dhar. Since no plastic is used, the implant lasts longer.

 A hip implant consists of a head, neck and stem. The head size used to be smaller, usually 22 mm, increasing its chances of dislocation. It is 36-58 mm in new implants, which allows more flexibility and minimises the chance of dislocation, explained Dhar.

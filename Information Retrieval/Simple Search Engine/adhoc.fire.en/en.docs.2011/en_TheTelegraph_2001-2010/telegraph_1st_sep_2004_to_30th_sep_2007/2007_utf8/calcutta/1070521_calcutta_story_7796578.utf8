 Come July, JU to get its radio station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jadavpur University (JU) will launch its community radio station the first of its kind in eastern India by July. The programmes can be heard within a radius of five to 10 km from the campus.

 Webel Mediatronics, a state government undertaking, is helping the university to set up the radio station.

 JU has already placed an order with us and we are waiting for frequency allocation and completion of some other formalities. We expect all these to get over by June, said Gautam Barman, chief executive officer, Webel Mediatronics.

 The JU radio station will broadcast a variety of education-related programmes. There will be programmes for visually-challenged students, and employment news and career counselling for fresh graduates. Programmes on adult education, womens empowerment, community development, rural development, health care and maternity, consumer protection and sports will also be aired, with music interspersed in between.

 The programmes will be based on the feedback we have received in a survey, in which we wanted to find out what exactly people would want of the university radio, said Nilanjana Gupta, director of School of Media Communication and Culture, JU.

 The radio station will be an interactive, participatory and educational initiative to bridge the gaps between the educationally privileged and the deprived, said Gupta.

 Webel Mediatronics is already training some of our students. We are now looking for a director who will be able to run the station on a permanent basis, she added.

 The initial funding of Rs 15 lakh will come from a World Bank-funded programme.

 The JU move follows the Centres decision to grant community broadcasting licences to prominent educational institutions.

 We also had a word with the journalism and mass communication department of Calcutta University to set up another community radio station. But they have not yet shown any interest, Barman added.

 Midnight market

 Thai trinkets from Chiang Mais night bazaar sure sounds appealing, but if that seems like a far-fetched proposition right here, right now, then simply drop in to Shisha this Wednesday for a quick drink and, of course, some surprise shopping. 

 Come midweek and the busy lounge bar will don a new avatar for the night. Order your favourite Double Apple Hookah or a Churchill cigar with a Martini Morocco. But before you hit the dance floor, hop across to the adjacent banquet for an exciting midnight shopping rendezvous. 

 The market will be put together by Neha Bhatnagar, Vasundhara Mantri and Medhavini Khaitan for Le Souk and it will be a travelling market, hopping from one party destination of Calcutta to another. And the first stop is Shisha. 

 We have been toying with the idea of a night bazaar for some time now. The concept is new in Calcutta but Olive Souk in Delhi and Mumbai have had successful stints. Well run a trial on Wednesday and maybe make it a regular feature later, says Arvind Bhatnagar from Shisha.

 The extension of the hookah bar will wear a hatke look on Wednesday, very West Asian in feel and flavour. Lots of tents, some stocking style picks and some selling snacks like kebabs, falafel and humus.

 The makeshift design den is going to see the coming together of eight labels. A range of pottery and candles by Anupama Jalan in lots of earthy colours mixed with oranges and reds, a western wear line by Aparna Kumar (highlights of her collection being texturing and foiling), fusion wear by Dipiksha Murarka and bric-a-brac and homeware by Hugli, all trendy, feisty and funky. 

 The night will also witness Leena Kejriwals fine art portraiture snapshots against some fun backdrops and a luxurious line of bags and stoles by Manju and Shradha Hada of Sumeru. Also on display will be loungewear for men by Medhavini, mostly party shirts and evening jackets with creative jewellery in silver and semi-precious stones by Vasundhara. 

 The concept of a souk (bazaar in Arabic) might be new to the city, but given the fashion fever that has gripped Calcuttas party circuit, the idea is bound to go down well. 

 The idea of a souk is super if you have an exciting product mix and attractive prices. People love to shop. It gives vendors a wide market, a new opportunity. To the consumer, it adds another dimension to their drink-and-eat-out experience, and when it comes to women, well, she will love to shop, anywhere, anytime, says A.D. Singh of Olive Bar amp; Kitchen and host of Olive Souk.

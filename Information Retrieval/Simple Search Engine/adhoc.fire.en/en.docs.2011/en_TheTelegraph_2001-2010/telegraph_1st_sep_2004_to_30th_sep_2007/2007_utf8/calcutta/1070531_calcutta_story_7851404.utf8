 Horns of a dilemma

 Italy was able to communicate with the rest of the world after it mastered the art of Neo-realism. De Sica, Rossellini and Visconti made masterpieces of universal subject matter in a modern vein that were very strong on recognisable story content. Critical observation of society, new language and popularity were the three key elements that made Italian cinema work, from Neo-realism onwards, and those elements became the mainstay of Italian drama in the decade that followed. During the Sixties, Italian cinema also became experimental with directors like Michelangelo Antonioni, in the avant-garde works of Mario Bava and Sergio Leone, and the poetic worlds of Federico Fellini and Pier Paolo Pasolini. La dolce vita was an extraordinary phenomenon, with lasting effects on society as well. Born into this rich legacy, it is natural that modern film director, actor, and screenwriter Leonardo Pieraccioni (born February 17, 1965) will carry the mantle of his predecessors with elan. Born in Florence, he debuted in the Italian TV and directed his first movie, I laureati, in 1995. This evening the Consulate General of Italy hosts a screening of his comedy, Ti Amo in Tutte Le Lingue Del Mondo (I Love You in Every Language in the World) with English subtitles. The film centres around Gilberto, a 40-year-old gym teacher in a Tuscan high school. One of his students, 17-year-old Paolina, has a crush on him and hounds him relentlessly, threatening to accuse him of sexual harassment if he doesnt go out with her. Meanwhile, Gilberto has met the woman of his dreams, the stunning vet, Margherita. Complications ensue.

 Event: Screening of Italian film Ti Amo in Tutte Le Lingue Del Mondo (I Love You in Every Language in the World) When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Max Mueller Bhavan

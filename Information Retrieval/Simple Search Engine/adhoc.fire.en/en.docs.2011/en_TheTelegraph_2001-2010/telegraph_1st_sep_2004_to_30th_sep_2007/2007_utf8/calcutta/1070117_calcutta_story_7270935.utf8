 Pandit Jasraj: Veteran vocalist

All that you ever needed to know about the Dover Lane Music Conference, an annual affair that brings together some of the veterans of Indian classical music, is now just a click away. The 55th Annual Conference, presented by Desh, begins on January 22 at Nazrul Mancha.

 The official website of the Dover Lane Music Conference, www.thedoverlanemusicconference.org, was launched on Tuesday by Sanjay Budhia, managing director of Patton International, and B.K. Chandra of PC Chandra Jewellers, president of the conference.

 The website will be listed on 40 search engines within the next few days, so that people from all around the world can gain easy access, said Dover Lane Music Conference treasurer Bappa Sen. 

 The website provides information about the Dover Lane Music Academy, membership to the organisation, schedule of the current annual conference and details of the talent search contest held every year. A history of the Dover Lane Music Conference has been posted, along with a record of all musicians who have performed at the conference since its inception in 1952.

 A glimpse of past performances is also available, with a picture gallery of nearly 80 photographs of previous concerts. 

 The 55th edition will be inaugurated on the evening of January 22 by vocalist Vasundhara Komkali. She will perform at Dover Lane after 14 years. The line-up for the four days includes Amjad Ali Khan, Ayaan Ali Khan, Shahid Parvez, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pandit Jasraj, Shiv Kumar Sharma, Rashid Khan and Ajoy Chakraborty. 

 Vocalist Pandit Amiya Ranjan Banerjee will be honoured with the Sangeet Samman Award this year. We want to revive the dance programmes that were stopped two years ago. We are hopeful that we will be able to bring back some of the great dancers, said Chandra.

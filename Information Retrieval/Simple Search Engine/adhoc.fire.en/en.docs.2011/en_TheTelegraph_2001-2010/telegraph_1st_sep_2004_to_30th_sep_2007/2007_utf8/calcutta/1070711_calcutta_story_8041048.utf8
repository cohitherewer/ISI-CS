 Srabani Roy Karmakar, of Maharani Indira Devi Road, in Behala, has been living in knee-deep, filthy water since the downpour on July 3. She has no clue when the water will recede.

 Samir Sen, of Nibedita Sarani, is not just marooned, he is being forced to share space with snakes and poisonous insects.

 Scenes such as these will greet visitors to several Behala pockets. 

 A week has passed since the deluge, but Kshudiram Pally, Green Park, Adarsha Nagar, Mahendra Banerjee Road, Motilal Gupta Road, Hemanta Mukherjee Road, Subhas Marg, Airport Road, Pally Sree, Anandanagar and Joyrampur are still waterlogged.

 Aamra shobai jole bondi (We are all imprisoned in water), said Timir Bose, of Motilal Gupta Road, summing up the situation.

 We had never faced such a crisis, said Ratna Sur, the chairperson of borough XIII of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. She blamed the situation on the negligence of the engineers who are supervising the drainage revamp work, under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP), in Behala.

 In her areas, she said, people are working round-the-clock to drain out water. Were spending sleepless nights, but have no idea when the situation will return to normal. 

 Sovon Chatterjee, the chairman of borough XIV, said several pumps have been pressed into service, but they have failed to drain out water as the canals are all heavily silted.

 Besides, CEIP personnel have erected a number of barriers in the canals that cannot be seen till the water level comes down. As a result, the water-holding capacity of the Begor, Moni and Charial canals have dropped considerably and they are always full to the brim.

 In pockets where the water has receded, the roads have become cratered. Chatterjee said the roads will be repaired after the monsoon.

 Repairs will start before the Puja, though patchwork will be taken up on an emergency basis, he said.

 The prolonged waterlogging has also caused an outbreak of enteric diseases in Behala. In the past week, 25 people with enteric diseases had turned up at Vidyasagar Hospital. People have been asked to boil their drinking water. We are also spraying bleaching powder and distributing halogen tablets to the residents, said Chatterjee.

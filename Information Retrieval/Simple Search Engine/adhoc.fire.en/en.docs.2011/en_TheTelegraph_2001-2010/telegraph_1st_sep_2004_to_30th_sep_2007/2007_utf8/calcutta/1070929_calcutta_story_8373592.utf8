 Waterlogging woes are far from over in pockets of Garia and Kalighat, long after the last drop has dried on the streets elsewhere. High tide is the primary cause, especially in Kalighat.

 Residents of Garia blocked the intersection of Raja SC Mullick Road and NSC Bose Road for four hours from 8am on Friday to protest the waterlogging. They did not allow even rickshaws to pass. Regular commuters were severely affected.

 The pocket is part of the constituency of the chief minister and the mayor. 

 A large contingent of police, led by district police superintendent Praveen Kumar, was deployed. The blockade was lifted after the director of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, Santanu Basu, promised to look into the matter.

 The areas hit hardest are Naktala, Rathtala, Bidhan Pally, Narkelbagan, Kalachand Para, Bansdroni, Sree Kanan, HL Sarkar Road and Rania.

 We have been living in water since Monday. But the administration is only saying that the situation will improve after the monsoon is over, said Ratan Das, a Rania resident.

 The water in Madhyabidhan Palli has not receded even an inch. The level of water actually rose during high tide in Tollys Nullah, said Surya Subha Bandopadhyay, a student.

 High tide has also been inundating large parts of Kalighat and Naktala, which are otherwise not waterlogged, for the past three days.

 I have drained out 70 large mugs of water from my shop and yet, there is more, said Subrata Das, who has a cosmetics shop on SP Mukherjee Road. According to him, the area gets flooded during the rainy season but the volume of water increases three times during high tide. It takes more than three hours for the water to recede, Das added.

 The water rose up to four-and-a-half feet in certain areas of Kalighat on Thursday, claimed shopkeeper Shashi Shekhar Saha.

 Water has been gushing up the drains during high tide for the past two days. This used to happen years ago, but stopped when the Metro Railway work was on. It has now started again, said an elderly resident of Naktala.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hurdles to hygiene

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Safe Food

 Come mid-April, the civic body 

 will launch its Serve Safe Food campaign to ensure quality 

 and hygiene in over 200,000 eateries in Calcutta.

 The intention is noble, but the 

 bigger question is whether the Calcutta Municipal Corporation 

 (CMC) is equipped to handle such an operation. 

 We have 35-odd food inspectors 

 and the number is not adequate to cover 200,000 eateries. 

 But the bigger worry is the state of the civic central laboratory, 

 which lacks both manpower and infrastructure to test food 

 samples, said an official in the civic health department, 

 requesting anonymity. 

 From ensuring clean kitchens to 

 cracking down on spurious food items, the CMC has set an 

 ambitious target in its Serve Safe Food campaign. 

 But the food inspectors are wary 

 of the mandate. Ensuring cleanliness in the kitchens of 

 elite eateries is not difficult. The bigger challenge is 

 banning adulterated food items, said a food inspector. 

 According to him, tomato and chilli 

 sauces used in roadside eateries, or colours used in sweets, 

 can cause serious health hazards, ranging from skin disease 

 to anaemia. 

 We are aware that industrial-grade 

 colours and harmful chemicals are used in food items at 

 eateries. But we are ill-equipped to rein them in, explained 

 the food inspector. 

 A case in point: Rajpur-Sonarpur 

 municipality, which has okayed nearly 30,000 eateries in 

 the Garia-Sonarpur belt. We have only one sanitary officer 

 to check food in these eateries, said Kamal Ganguly, chairman 

 of the municipality. 

 Tapas Chatterjee, chairman, Rajarhat-Gopalpur 

 municipality, echoed Ganguly. Keeping pace with the realty 

 boom, eateries have sprung up, but the municipality does 

 not have any facility to test food quality. I am aware 

 that often, unhealthy food is supplied. But we do not even 

 have a food inspector, said Chatterjee. 

 Not just lack of men and machines, 

 there are procedural constraints, too. By the law, inspectors 

 have to pay a sum for the goods confiscated from an eatery. 

 But the food inspector is not allotted the money, so seizure 

 of food items becomes difficult, said a senior civic health 

 department official.

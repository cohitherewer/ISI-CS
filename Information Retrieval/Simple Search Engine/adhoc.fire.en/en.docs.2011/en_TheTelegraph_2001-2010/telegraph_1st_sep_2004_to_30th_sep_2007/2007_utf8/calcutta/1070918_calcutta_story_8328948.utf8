 The state government and the army have joined hands to set up a heritage and cultural hub around James Prinseps memorial at Prinsep Ghat, on the bank of the Hooghly.

 An open-air amphitheatre below Vivekananda Setu, a museum that will display military and historical artefacts, an urban forest with a bird sanctuary, a floating theatre jetty beside Man-O-War jetty and a rail museum at the abandoned Prinsep Ghat station have been planned.

 If everything goes by plan, the Prinsep Heritage Complex could be ready by December.

 The blueprint was unveiled on Monday by GOC (Bengal) Major-General Dipak Raj at a meeting chaired by the chief secretary. Additional chief secretary and transport secretary Sumantra Choudhury, environment experts and representatives of the railways and the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) attended the event. 

 We are trying to build a unique complex, which will showcase the citys and the armys heritage and legacy. The state government has shown keen interest since the idea was mooted, said Raj.

 The public works department, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, HRBC and the forest department will be part of the project, which will stand on 10-odd acres. The budget has been tentatively set at Rs 10 crore.

 The memorial will in no way be affected by the complex, said Brigadier Matthews, who will coordinate the project on behalf of the army. 

 Environmental activist Subhas Dutta insisted that an environment impact assessment study be conducted and that the project conform to the country planning act.

 The museums and installations should in no way affect the grand structure of Prinseps memorial, stated Banani Kakkar of PUBLIC.

 The army officers promised to look into the suggestions by the green lobby.

 Burial funds to run home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A pet being buried at the Thakurpukur home 

Twelve-year-old Pompom died three months ago. But 13 destitute children have two square meals a day because of the canine

 Nine-year-old Douglas, too, is buried in a pet cemetery, but the money his master donated provides for the education of these children 

 Charging a fee for burying pets has been helping an NGO in Thakurpukur run a home for poor children for the past three years. 

 I started the home five years ago, after taking voluntary retirement from a nationalised bank. The number of inmates soon started going up, stretching my limited resources, said Tarun Guha, founder of the NGO. 

 The financial crisis compounded following the purchase of a plot for setting up the home. Things became so bad that I decided to close down the home, recounted Guha. Around this time, the pet dog of one of Guhas friends, a professor at Kalyani University, died.

 He was desperately looking for a place to bury his pet and erect a memorial. He then advised me to use part of the plot for burying pets and charge a fee from the pet-owners, said Guha. Nearly 400 pets have since been buried on our Thakurpukur premises. 

 Guha charges around Rs 700 for burying a pet. When we heard how the fee is being utilised, we wanted to contribute more to the cause. After all, our pet will earn the blessings of the children who stay in the home, said Debashish Biswas, who has buried his dog at the cemetery.

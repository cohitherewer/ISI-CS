 Ladies day in jail

 - Programmes to fan awareness

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Womens Day will be celebrated in correctional homes across the state for the first time this year. The authorities hope to make women inmates aware of their rights and duties through the exercise. 

 We have organised several programmes at Presidency and Alipore Central jails on Thursday. Eminent personalities from different spheres of life and senior government officials, most of them women, will visit the correctional homes to interact with the female inmates. We will try to generate awareness about the domestic violence act, said inspector-general of police (correctional homes) B.D. Sharma.

 Debates, essay competition, exhibitions, banner and poster painting, dance and plays will also be organised on the occasion. Women inmates and their children will take part in the events. The theme for many of the contests is violence against women.

 There are 1,062 women and 115 children in correctional homes in Bengal. Seventy-one of them had been permitted to go home by the court, but could not do so because of various reasons. The National Legal Services Authority has decided to observe the week starting March 8 as the week for legal empowerment of women.

 The Womens Day programmes will bring variety to the lives of the inmates, some of whom cut off from society for years. The events are also a platform for inmates to show their talent. The events will help integrate the inmates with the mainstream, said a jail officer.

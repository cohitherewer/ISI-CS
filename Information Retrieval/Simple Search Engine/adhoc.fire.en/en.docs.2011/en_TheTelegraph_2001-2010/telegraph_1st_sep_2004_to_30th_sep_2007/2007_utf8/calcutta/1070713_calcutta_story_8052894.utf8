A 14-year-old girl, sent by her mother to work in a Behala factory, was abducted to Uttar Pradesh, where she was forced to dance at weddings.

 A police team from the city rescued Rita Jaiswara from a village in Kushinagar district, in UP, and brought her back on Thursday. 

 She was produced in a court and handed over to mother Munia, who lives on Peary Mohan Roy Road, in Chetla.

 Rita left home in the first week of March with a neighbour, Maya Barui, who told Munia that she would arrange a job for the girl at a factory run by one of her acquaintances in Behala. Maya has been arrested.

 An officer of Chetla police station said that ever since she lost her husband a few years ago, Munia has been finding it difficult to raise her four children. Out of desperation, she was looking for job for her second daughter Rita. Sensing an opportunity, Maya came forward with the offer and Munia was taken in by it.

 But instead of Behala, Maya and two accomplices took Rita to Kushinagar, where she was kept in a small house in a remote village, 90 km from the nearest railway station, along with another girl and a boy. 

 All three were made to dance at weddings by a couple, who never paid them anything. The children were only given two meals a day, said a member of the rescue team, led by sub-inspectors B.N. Bose and S.K. Sahana.

 Munia recalled that whenever she asked Maya about Rita, she would avoid an answer. Finally, she sought Rs 1,000 to get Rita back. But even after paying the amount, I did not get back my daughter.

 A few weeks ago, she broke down and confided in her neighbours, who helped her lodge a complaint. Soon after, Maya was arrested and the cops learnt from her of Ritas whereabouts.

 Our officers managed to trace the girl to a remote village in UP, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (south).

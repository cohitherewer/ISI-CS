 Soot and fumes to breathe

 Save My Space 

 The problem

 We live in Dum Dum and are being severely affected by the pollution caused by a dying and bleaching factory in the area. The factory Bala Techno Synthetics Ltd at 21A Dum Dum Road is located right in the middle of a densely-populated neighbourhood. 

 It uses furnace oil to run its five boilers and thermic fluid heaters and continuously produces large quantities of soot and dirt.

 The sulphurous vapours and other toxic gases emitted by the industry have triggered breathing problems among many local residents and have almost made the area uninhabitable.

 The complaint 

 We have tried a lot to draw the attention of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and the peoples representatives, but with little effect.

 As industrialisation is the order of the day, it seems that the authorities have little time for the common citizens. After prolonged persuasion, the company agreed to convert its heating gadgets to a coal-gas fired system (which is more environment-friendly), but stopped after converting only one boiler and one thermic fluid heater.

 While the company plays out its game, the lives of residents, especially of children and the elderly, are at stake. We appeal to the administration and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to take up the issue with urgency and save thousands of citizens from these noxious fumes.

 STAT TALK

 Industries 

 According to the pollution control board there are 340 small and medium factories within the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area that use boilers. Of these, around 290 have recently converted to oil-fired systems from coal-fired ones (which used to cause heavy pollution) as part of a project funded by the India Canada Environment Facility. About 140 of these factories may be using furnace oil, which causes smoke and soot, though the board stresses that it is extremely difficult to meet the emission norms while using it.

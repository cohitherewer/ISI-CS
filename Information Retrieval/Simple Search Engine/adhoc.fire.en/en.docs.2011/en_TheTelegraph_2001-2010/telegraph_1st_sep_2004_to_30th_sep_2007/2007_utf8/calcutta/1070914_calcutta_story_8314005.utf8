 Father missing after spat with son

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Biman De, who left home early on Wednesday

Biman De, 53, an employee of the Geological Survey of India, went missing from his Bagha Jatin residence, where he lives with his wife and son, on Wednesday morning. Police are not suspecting any foul play.

 According to wife Mandira, De had returned home from office late on Tuesday and had an argument with son Rupam, 22.

 My son has psychological problems and sometimes loses his temper over trivial reasons, she said.

 The same thing happened on Tuesday, added Mandira. After the argument, my husband threatened to leave the house if Rupam continued to behave in this way. However, I did not take him seriously. 

 When she woke up the next morning, she could not find her husband. She thought he had gone on an errand and would return soon.

 I panicked when he did not come back even after an hour. I called up his colleagues at his Salt Lake office, but he was nowhere to be found, she said.

 De had left home on earlier occasions, but usually returned the next day. But this time, Im worried, because I have no specific information about his whereabouts, she said. 

 Des neighbours are also anxious over his disappearance. The family often quarrelled over petty matters. Biman would sometimes leave home without informing anyone but his wife never appeared worried, said Dipu Dutta, a neighbour.

 Mandira, however, hopes her husband will come back soon. I hope he has not gone too far. How long can he stay angry with his only son? 

 The district superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), Praveen Kumar, said his officers are looking for De. We are searching various places and also contacting his office, he said.

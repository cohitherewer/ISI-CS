The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shop stop between shots

 - Actress in town for shoot drops by at designer address to look at gear and accessories

 A STAFF REPORTER

 CLOTHES ON HER MIND: Preity Zinta

 Calcutta may not be able to compete with Mumbai and Delhi for designer muscle, but what the town does have is enough to tempt the stars to pull out their plastic.

 Preity Zinta, in town to shoot for Rituparno Ghoshs The Last Lear, is the latest Bollywood biggie to check out what the city style stable has to offer, with a Sunday shopping spree at 85 Lansdowne. 

 Kareena Kapoor also visited the same designer address a couple of months ago, picking up armloads of Anamika Khanna and Shantanu Goyal creations.

 Whether the 45-minute shop stop between shoots at Salt Lake and Kalighat was work or pleasure is not clear. Pretty Preity was accompanied by her favourite designer Surily Goel. The stylist, who worked with the star on Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Salaam Namaste and Jaan-e-Maan, will create Preitys look in Ghoshs first English film, also starring Amitabh Bachchan, Arjun Rampal and Jisshu Sengupta.

 What precisely the star-stylist duo picked up was strictly hush hush, but shop the actress did, browsing through clothes and accessories. The Jiya Jale girl was drawn to elegant and sober pieces, according to the spokesperson for the south Calcutta store, that stocks big names such as Rajesh Pratap Singh, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Rina Dhaka, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Shantanu Goenka, Anamika Khanna and Raghavendra Rathore. The Mumbai-based Surily, too, is scheduled to start retailing at 85 Lansdowne.

 Ambani bahu Neeta also made the most of a recent trip to town (accompanying husband Mukesh), spending the better part of a day at Satramdas Dhalamal, leaving with a 15-20 piece jewellery haul. Small by her usual standards, according to designer Raj Mahtani.

 The Calcutta look will be in the limelight again later this month, with Sharbari Datta being called on by Brinda Rai (Ashs mother) to create a few ensembles for Abhisheks trousseau. That association, too, started during a shooting schedule involving a Rituparno film Aishwarya was in town for Chokher Bali when mommy first called on Datta in 2003.

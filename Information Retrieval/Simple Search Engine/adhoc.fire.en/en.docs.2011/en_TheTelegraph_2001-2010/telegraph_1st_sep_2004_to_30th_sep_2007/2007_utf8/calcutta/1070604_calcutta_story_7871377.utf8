 Unrest delays trains

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The unrest in Rajasthan has affected the running of North India-bound trains from the city.

 On Sunday, railway officials had to reschedule two long-distance trains as the corresponding Calcutta-bound trains arrived late.

 With the situation not improving, railway officials are keeping their fingers crossed about the trains scheduled to make their journeys on Monday. There may be further delays, said an Eastern Railway official.

 On Saturday, the Howrah-Delhi Kalka Mail, scheduled to leave Howrah at 7.40pm, was delayed for more than six hours. It left at 1am.

 The Howrah-Jodhpur Express, scheduled to leave at 11.30pm on Sunday, will leave at 1.15pm on Monday, railway officials said.

 A number of trains from Calcutta to various destinations in North India was delayed by hours.

 Most of the trains are leaving Howrah on schedule but are getting delayed on the way, said another official.

 The Rajdhani expresses from Howrah and Sealdah were delayed by around 10 hours on Sunday. The Down trains, too, arrived at Howrah and Sealdah hours behind schedule. 

 Both trains arrived seven-and-a-half hours late, railway officials said.

 In many places, the railway tracks have been damaged by protestors, said an official. The two Rajdhani trains from the city had to reach New Delhi through the Tundla-Agra route, which caused the delays, he said.

 The Howrah-Jodhpur Express and the Sealdah-Jaipur Express were cancelled on Friday. The Sealdah-Jaipur summer special, scheduled for Monday departure at 10.50pm, has been cancelled.

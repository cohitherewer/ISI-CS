 Report card fears claim teenager

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dipika De, 17, took her life under pressure

 Study stress and parental pressure claimed yet another young life on Friday, with 17-year-old Dipika De hanging herself in the bedroom of her north Calcutta home.

 The student of Class XII decided to end her life, fearing that her next report card would fail to meet her familys expectations.

 Dipika mentioned in her suicide note that she was suffering from depression and feeling ashamed for not fulfilling her parents dreams. She ended the note, written on a blank page of her exercise book, with the words: No one is responsible for my death.

 Early on Friday, Dipikas family members at their Ishwar Mill Lane residence, in the Burtola police station area, found the door of her bedroom bolted from inside. They panicked when she did not respond to repeated knocking and hammering on the door.

 They broke open the door, only to find her hanging from the clamp of the ceiling fan. A rope was tied around her neck, said Pradip Bhattacharya, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 She was rushed to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where she was declared dead.

 We did not suspect anything on Thursday night. She had dinner with us as usual and entered her room. It was only when we found her door locked and no response from inside did we fear something was wrong, Dipikas father Swapan De, a railway employee, told police.

 Friends of Dipika, a student of Nari Shiksha Niketan, in the Jorasanko area, told police she was a a mediocre student in the science stream who was under pressure from her parents to perform better in the school-leaving examination.

 Dipikas neighbours corroborated this, said Dipak Dutta, officer-in-charge of Burtola police station. She was known in her locality and in school as a pleasant girl, who seemed to be under pressure.

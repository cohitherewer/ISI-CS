 Faster mutation nod

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic authorities are trying to speed up the process of sanction of building construction and mutation proposals. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya feels quicker processing of the applications will fill up the civic coffers.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has directed director-general (building) Gora Chand Mondol and chief manager (revenue) Aniruddha Mukherjee to work towards simple mutation across the table and sanction of building proposals within a week.

 Online simple mutation or mutation across the table will be a reality once the e-networking infrastructure is in place. The process should be completed by the Puja, said the municipal commissioner.

 In civic assessment parlance, one-to-one transfer of ownership of a landed property by devolution, gift or sale is known as simple mutation. 

 Mayoral council member (building) Dipankar De stressed that quick processing of building construction and regularisation proposals is a must for the financial growth of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 I hope the building department will contribute more to the civic coffers in 2007-08. The number of simple mutation cases cleared by the assessment department has gone up by more than 70 per cent over the last fiscal, he said.

 The CMCs total revenue this fiscal has registered a 40 per cent growth over the last. Better delivery of services by the building and assessment departments is the reason behind the revenue growth, said civic officials. 

 According to chief manager (revenue) Mukherjee, all simple mutation cases filed by March 14 have been cleared. The assessment department cleared over 1,400 simple mutation cases in January and February.

 Missing cash stings bank

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 The disappearance of Rs 15 lakh from the current account of a city businessman has landed a public sector bank in a spot. 

 The manager of the branch concerned has been suspended and a probe started, but the businessman is yet to get the money back.

 Last June, Vinod Bagla, who deals in synthetic dyes, discovered a shortage of Rs 15 lakh in Bagla Synthetics current account at the Beadon Street branch of UCO Bank. After scanning the bank statement, he got in touch with officers at the branch to seek an explanation. 

 I was only told that an inquiry was on. I waited for some time in vain. Then, I wrote to the Reserve Bank of India. I informed the detective department of Calcutta Police about the fraud in November, said Bagla, who is still making the rounds of the bank and the detective department. 

 We are conducting an inquiry into the matter and have sought help from investigating agencies. Till we have the details, we cannot pay back the money, stated general manager of UCO Bank B.K. Das.

 The incident comes after a spate of bank frauds from sanction of loans against forged documents to funds discrepancy in savings or current accounts in the city and adjoining districts. 

 While the detective department officers have cracked many such cases, they have done little to help Bagla. 

 Some other investigating agencies are involved, and so our hands are tied, claimed deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh. 

 According to Bagla, whose office is in Kankurgachhi, he had deposited 11 cheques, totalling Rs 25 lakh, at UCO Bank last March, with instructions to open two fixed deposit accounts of Rs 5 lakh each. 

 But only one fixed deposit account was opened and the rest of the money was transferred from the current account to a sundry account without my permission In the process, I was cheated of Rs 15 lakh, explained Bagla, struggling to cope with the sudden depletion of his capital base.

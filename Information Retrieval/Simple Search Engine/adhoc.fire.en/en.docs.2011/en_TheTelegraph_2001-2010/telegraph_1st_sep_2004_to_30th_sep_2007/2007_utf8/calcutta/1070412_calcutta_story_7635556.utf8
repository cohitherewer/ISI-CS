The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cell snare, surrender

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Clues are pouring in, but cops are still groping in the dark.

 Amidst conflicting theories over the death of Jayanta Bag and his nine-year-old daughter Tiyasa, the investigators managed a fourth catch on Wednesday with Jhantu Pal surrendering at the Howrah CJMs court.

 The police also found the cellphone that Bag had allegedly used to take photographs of women who went to him for abortion.

 Jhantu is among the four men Bag mentioned in his suicide note. He had taken a woman to the quack for abortion last month We expect him to give us crucial leads, said Niraj Kumar Singh, superintendent of police, Howrah.

 The other three youth mentioned in Bags suicide note Ujjwal Biswas, Raju Roy and Chandu Koley are already in the police net.

 According to police, failing to bear humiliation at the hands of the gang of four, Bag committed suicide early on April 4 after attempting to kill wife Sutapa and daughter Tiyasa.

 We are interrogating the four men and also scanning the cellphone, said Singh. 

 Police seized the cellphone from an employee of Buddhadeb, whose shop police had raided on Tuesday and seized a computer and a CD writer. 

 As the seizure list swells police found two CDs, a DVD player, a VCD and a still camera at Bags home on Tuesday more details about the sex-abortion-cameraphone saga keep tumbling out.

 The discs contain pornographic material But we are yet to ascertain how it reached Bags home, said an officer of Jagachha police station. 

 The state government has roped in CID to investigate the case, which has witnessed twists and turns with each passing day. 

 In a bid to know more about Bag and his dealings, police summoned Sumanta, Jayantas brother, and interrogated him on Wednesday. 

 But police are yet to interrogate Sutapa admitted in Howrah General Hospital as she is still not medically fit.

 If the delay in Sutapas recovery has slowed down investigation, Bags autopsy report stumped the cops. On Tuesday, police admitted the possibility of murder. 

 We have asked for expert opinion on the autopsy report and are awaiting the forensic teams findings, said a senior district police officer.

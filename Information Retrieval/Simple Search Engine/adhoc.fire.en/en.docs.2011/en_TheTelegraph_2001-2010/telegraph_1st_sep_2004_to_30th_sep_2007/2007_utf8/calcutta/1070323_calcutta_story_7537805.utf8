 Boroughs get hall control

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The management and upkeep of the civic community halls and auditoriums, which have been draining the central exchequer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for years, will be handed over to borough offices.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has taken the decision following a survey of the 24 community halls and auditoriums by consultant (land and public-private participation) Samar Kumar Mitra.

 In the new system, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay explained, the borough committees will have to shoulder all expenses for running the facilities. The committees, on their part, will enjoy complete freedom to fix the rate for hiring the halls. 

 There is only one condition the halls will have to be run on a no-loss-no-profit basis, Bandyopadhyay said.

 At present, the borough committees control the bookings and also have the right to offer concessions on hiring charges, but the salary for the staff and other expenses for running the hall are borne by the civic headquarters from the central fund.

 Revenue generation from the halls is affected, as borough chairpersons and councillors indiscriminately offer concessions on hiring charges for political reasons, said an official. It has been found that concessions from 25 to 50 per cent have been offered in more than 98 per cent of the cases.

 The annual income from the community halls and auditoriums is little over Rs 20 lakh, while the expenditure from the central fund is more than Rs 5 crore. 

 The civic body owns 17 community halls and seven auditoriums in nine of the 15 boroughs. The maximum concentration is in borough IV, which has six halls. More than 80 employees work in these facilities.

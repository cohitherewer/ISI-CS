 Astronomer honoured

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Prof Ramanath Cowsik

 The MP Birla Memorial Award 2007 was conferred on Prof Ramanath Cowsik on Wednesday for his contribution to the spread of astronomy, astrophysics, earth and planetary sciences and fundamental physics.

 Cowsik, the director of McDonnell Centre for the Space Sciences and Vainu Bappu Distinguished Professor of Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, is known for his seminal work in particle physics having direct applications in astronomy.

 He also played a key role in setting up Indian Astronomical Observatory the highest in the world, at 15,000 ft in Hanle, Ladakh.

 Prof Cowsik has not only played an important role in knowledge dissemination and research, but has also been successful in producing brilliant, original results for better understanding of the universe, said R.S. Lodha, the chairman of MP Birla Foundation.

 I was never coaxed by my parents to study the subject. My interest in it grew up quite naturally and subtly, said Cowsik.

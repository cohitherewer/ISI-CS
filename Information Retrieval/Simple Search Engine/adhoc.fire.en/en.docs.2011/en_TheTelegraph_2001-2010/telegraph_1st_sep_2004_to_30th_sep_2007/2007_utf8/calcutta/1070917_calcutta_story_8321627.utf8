 Bangla gang with passport

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Be on your guard during Puja shopping. Gangs of lifters from Bangladesh and Pune are on the prowl with a new set of tricks to stump shoppers.

 On Friday, police stumbled upon a Bangladeshi gang while investigating a lifting case in BBD Bag a few days ago. The seven members had arrived from Dhaka and Comilla with passports and on tourist visas.

 The men had crossed Benapole on September 4. They had a months visa and had put up in two rooms at a tourist lodge in Kidderpore. Almost all of them are in their late-20s or early-30s and seem to have carried out some lifting jobs in the city, said detective chief Ajoy Kumar.

 The hunt for the men began on September 10, when Adhir Biswas lost Rs 1 lakh. The middle-aged employee of a private company in Sonarpur, Biswas was walking down Clive Row with the money in the bag after stepping out of a bank. Some youths blocked his path on the pretext of selling green coconuts. As Biswas stopped to find out the price, another man slit his bag and lifted the money.

 According to the police, there could be several other gangs from across the border in the city. There is a group from Pune which is also active in the business district. They put up in cheap hotels for a day or two and return by train. They are known as Iranis and sometimes dress up like policemen to lift money, said a senior officer of the detective department. 

 The police found out about this group a few weeks ago, when officers of Burrabazar police station rounded up a member of a three-man gang while he was trying to lift money from a trader in the guise of a cop.

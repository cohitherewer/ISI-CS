The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Torment tale, little hint of remorse

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Anita Singh. A Telegraph picture

Mere bachche ko laiye. Usey bhookh lagi hai. 

 The words drown as Anita Singh breaks down at North Port Police station on Thursday evening, less than 24 hours since the 32-year-old flung her daughter Bishakha into the Hooghly from Howrah bridge. 

 However, there was no sign of remorse throughout the interrogation, during which the mother of three hardly mentioned Bishakha. All she fretted about was her youngest son Samar Bahadur and his meal. Anita refused to answer the questions properly, said an interrogating officer.

 The woman from Chhatuana village, in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, narrated how people in her village tormented her with crude remarks about her unstable mental condition and her husbands infidelity. Police, however, are not going by her incoherent statements and have decided to wait. At present, the search for Bishakas body, which remained untraced till Thursday evening, is on.

 Married in 1996, Anita has since been in Chhatuana with her husband, who owns a farm and even works as a road contractor. 

 It was only a few years ago that we heard she was behaving erratically at times. Her husband, Raj Narayan, would bring her along when he came here on business, said Jung Bahadur Singh, a distant relative of the Singhs, of Rustomjee Parsee Lane, Cossipore. 

 He tried to reason it out with her on Wednesday night at the police station, but she shot back: Humko marna tha, aur bachcha mar gaya .

 On Wednesday, Anita left her Howrah home around 4 pm, saying that she would take her children to Sarat Sadan, at Howrah Maidan. Instead, she took a bus from Mullick Fatak and reached Howrah station. We will check with Howrah police if any missing diary was lodged for her, said an officer.

 Hi-tech tools to learning

 - INITIATIVE TO FILL GAPS IN TRADITIONAL TEACHING

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Come July, Calcutta will see the launch of an initiative that aims to fill in the gaps left by the traditional education system.

 Starkids, an initiative of Academy for Professional Excellence, will work on children between age three and eight years to help develop in them a love for learning.

 Formal educational institutions only impart information to children. At Starkids, we delve not only into the Whats and Hows but also into the Whys, said Nirmal Agarwal, director and CEO, Starkids.

 The concept being followed by Starkids is based on the proven premises that every child is born gifted but requires the right environment to manifest his/her potential, and that up to 80 per cent of a childs intelligence and ability to learn develops between age three and eight years. This is the best time for the development of a childs brain and for maximising the inborn potential, said Agarwal.

 Programmes at the centre are divided into four levels Starters (for kids between three and five years), Movers (between five and six years), Flyers (between six and seven years) and Achievers (between seven and eight years).

 In contrast to the traditional chalk-and-talk mode of instruction, the centre will employ methods based on demonstration and activity. It will use hi-tech tools to enhance the learning experience.

 The kids will learn multiplication and division not just by seeing, but also by doing. Thus, a sum like dividing 12 cookies among eight people a five-minute task on the board takes half an hour as students try with actual cookies, said Agarwal.

 The centre will also help children acquire creative and functional skills including social and environmental awareness, lateral thinking, public speaking, leadership, personality development and practical application of knowledge.

 Classes will be conducted twice a week in a two-hour session, with 12 students in each class. Fees are Rs 800 per month.

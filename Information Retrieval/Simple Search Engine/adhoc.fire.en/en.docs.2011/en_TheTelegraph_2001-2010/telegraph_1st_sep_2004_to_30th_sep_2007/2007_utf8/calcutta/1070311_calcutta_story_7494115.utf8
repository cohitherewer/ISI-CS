The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Just do it, but not overdo it

 Creativity needs to be harnessed to ignite passion and open purses

 ADLIB

 I was waiting for the lift. A friend joined me in the queue. Suffering Ad lib every Sunday is the price he pays for our friendship. When are you writing about the Nike World Cup ad? he asked. I smiled. My mind was blank. I was actually trying hard to recall the ad.

 He kept on talking about the ad mostly in adjectives. There was nothing in his comments that could jog my memory. I was sure that I have not seen the ad yet. I managed the short ride on the lift with a lame excuse. I said I am waiting for the World Cup to start. There will be so much to write about then.

 Earlier this week, there was another request to write about the Nike ad in this weeks Ad lib. Without thinking, I agreed. A few minutes later panic gripped me how can I write about an ad that I have not seen.

 I switched on the television and to my utter relief found that Indias warm-up match against the Netherlands was being telecast live. I thought surely they would show the ad at some point of time. An hour went past yet there was no sign of Nike. 

 My blood pressure was shooting up. I was wondering how could I have missed an ad that everyone tension often creates such exaggeration is talking about. I definitely felt embarrassed.

 I asked a colleague who was watching the match with me whether he has seen the latest Nike ad. He gave me a blank look and asked, Which one? At this point something happened inside my head and I remembered an ad where people play cricket on roofs of buses stuck in a massive traffic jam.

 I closed my eyes and saw people jumping off balconies on to stationary buses and bowling with Shoaib Akhtar-ish speed and venom. Images started fleeting into my mind. I picked up the phone and dialled the friend. My excitement was palpable. He confirmed, Yes, that is the ad. I almost jumped with joy and shouted, Eureka! 

 Stranger coincidences are known to have happened, but just at that point I was amazed to find the Nike ad being screened. Floodgates of memory opened up. This was a shorter version of the ad. By then I remembered seeing the longer ad in its full glory. The colleague who smiled and asked: Oh! Was this the ad you were asking me about? He too had seen the ad. I felt relieved that I had company. 

 There obviously are two kinds of recipients of the ad. Both have relished the ad one enjoyed it so much that they did not notice Nike or the Just do it signage. The others remembered the ad as intended as a Nike ad for the World Cup.

 The moot point is how large are each of these segments? Or is the real question even more serious? 

 Can any ad, let alone a big budget one like the Nike ad, afford to have two such segments? Is there always a danger of high-order creative skills overshadowing a brand message? Should creativity then be shunned? From a serious student of marketing the verdict would be unequivocal. Excellence on any dimension is preferable to mediocrity. From a cold business logic, one would rather waste half the money than the whole of it in an also-ran ad.

 The real lesson indeed is simple and surprisingly well known. Creativity at the best of times is like a torrent the surge needs to be harnessed to produce the glow. The aim is to create the spark that will ignite passion, touch hearts. And open purses. Stopping short can be an expensive marketing offence.

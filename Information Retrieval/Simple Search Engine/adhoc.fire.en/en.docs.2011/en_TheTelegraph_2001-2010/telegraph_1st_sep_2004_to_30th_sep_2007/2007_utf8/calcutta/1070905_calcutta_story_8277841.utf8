 Dummy doctor: Munna Bhai among his teachers in medical school. The doctor to his left wrote the entrance papers for him in the film 

 That the practice among government employees of using subordinate colleagues for household work thrives is apparent from the report Reinstate constable, high court tells RPF, July 25. Government orders have failed to check this vice. 

 Many government employees feel that it is their right to make their juniors do personal chores. It is sad that a Railway Protection Force constable was suspended for allegedly disobeying the orders of an officers wife. Even if the constable was in the wrong, how can it take seven years to settle the case? 

 The inordinate delay virtually proves that the charge against the constable is cooked up. The ulterior motive of the officer to make the constable suffer is apparent. But why didnt the officers superiors ensure justice? Could it be that they themselves are indulging in the same unauthorised practice? The punishment was a way to scare other insolent constables. 

 The administration seems bent on taking away the dignity of junior workers. No government order will work unless the officers do some soul-searching.

 Apropos the report JEE dummy in cop net, July 26, it is alarming that students are getting into medical courses by getting dummy candidates to write their entrance examination. The joint entrance racket is not only giving unworthy youngsters the responsibility of saving peoples lives but denying those who actually deserve the chance of becoming doctors. 

 Those who ran the racket should be punished more severely than the dummy candidates. The police and the detective department should focus on weeding out the racket. It poses a threat to the entire society. 

 It is the responsibility of the joint entrance council to make it impossible for examinees to adopt fraudulent means. At the very least, the photographs on the admit card should be clear. The examination process can be made lengthier, but only genuine candidates should get through.

 Apropos the report Six on merit list via use of dummies, July 25, it is disheartening that six students have taken the dummy route to success in the joint entrance exam. They should be punished stringently. From the facts emerging about the racket it is apparent that it is deep-rooted and has been functioning for years. Those who made it to medical colleges through the use of dummies should be identified and rusticated so that others do not dare to follow suit.

 It isnt possible that the joint entrance racket operated for several years without arousing suspicion of the board officials. The government should take the probe more seriously.

Apropos the report Metro VIP coach, July 31, it is unjust to vacate a crowded Metro coach to make room for VIPs from abroad. The inconvenience the passengers were subjected to could have been avoided if the authorities had informed them in advance. All the commuters were bona fide passengers who had paid for the journey. Alternative arrangements should have been made for them. The incident underscores the callousness of the Metro authorities. Common people invariably suffer in India when VIPs travel.

 Apropos the report Civic takeover to save pond, July 24, it is a pleasure to know that the civic body is taking steps to save a waterbody from landfill. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation should do the same for all waterbodies in and around the city.

I hope Anshu Jajodias story (Special boy on social mission, July 26) inspires thousands of other Anshus to fight their impairment. But is society ready to understand the problems of the impaired? I know a child of Class VIII who can walk only with great difficulty. He is very good in studies, oration and acting. But his classmates taunt him. His teachers, on the other hand, do not let him queue up for anything. The boy says that all he wants is to be treated like everyone else. It is the duty of each teacher and parent to teach youngsters to treat special people as an important part of society.

Apropos the report Day time home for aged, July 31, more short-stay homes for senior citizens are the need of the hour. In many families, the elderly do not have the freedom to live as they want to. Short-stay homes offer them the opportunity to be themselves at least for a few hours. Such homes should be opened in the districts too.

 The report Cop who knows every criminal, July 25, made for a wonderful read. I hope theres a passenger like Sujit Bhattacharjee on every bus! The pickpockets would then switch to some other profession. Its funny how the criminals salute Bhattacharjee. The cartoon reminded me of a dignitary being given the guard of honour. I wonder whether Bhattacharjee locks his door at night, given his clout among criminals.

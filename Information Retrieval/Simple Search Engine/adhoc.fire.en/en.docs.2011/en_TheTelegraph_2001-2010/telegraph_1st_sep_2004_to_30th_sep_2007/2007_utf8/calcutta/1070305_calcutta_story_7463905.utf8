 Job rule change for firms, students

 Winds of change are blowing at Besu. A Telegraph picture

Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), Shibpur, is set to change its campus interview rules to create a win-win situation for the students and the industry.

 Starting this year, the best brains of the university may be allowed to appear for job interviews conducted by a select group of companies even after they have bagged offers from other firms.

 Most top tech and business schools follow this model. Besu has so far prevented students from appearing for interviews after they have bagged a job offer.

 The changes, if made, will benefit the companies that are forced to choose among second-rung students after mass recruitment on Day Zero, explained Manas Sanyal of the human resources development department of Besu.

 The university conducts students perception study to choose companies for the Day Zero slots. To give other companies, like Siemens, ABB, Google and Ashok Leyland, a level playing field, Besu will allow them to interview and make offers to the toppers. 

 Most employers like to recruit students who have secured more than 65 per cent marks throughout their educational career. But the best brains are often snagged by the end of the first day of campus interview, known as Day Zero. Companies slotted later have to choose among the leftovers, elaborated Sanyal.

 Students prefer companies like Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys for the Day Zero slots, Sanyal said, but it is often manufacturing majors like HP Lab, L amp;T and ABB that offer pay packets of more than Rs 6 lakh per year. The average tech firm paycheque hovers between Rs 2.5 and Rs 3 lakh per annum.

 A handful of firms also renege on offers. Sanyal said they are from both the IT and the manufacturing sector. By withdrawing offers at the last moment, the firms have in the past left even toppers jobless.

 Often, projects fall through and the companies need for manpower drops. We try to negotiate with them, saying it is unethical to withdraw offers. A few of them take in students on probation, but do not confirm them, said Sanyal.

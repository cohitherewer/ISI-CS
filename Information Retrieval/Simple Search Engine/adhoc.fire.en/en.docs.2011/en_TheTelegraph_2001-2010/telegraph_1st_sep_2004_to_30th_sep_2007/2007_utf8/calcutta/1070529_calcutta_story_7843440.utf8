 Patients suffered at National Medical College and Hospital on Monday, as around 200 junior doctors and interns observed a ceasework to protest Sundays vandalism.

 Keeping in mind the health ministers scheduled visit to the hospital on Tuesday, the authorities met the protesters and tried to persuade them to lift the ceasework, but in vain.

 Patients had to wait for hours at the OPD counter, while several were denied admission. One such patient was Nani Guha, a Liluah resident suffering from a urinary disease, who was referred to National Medical by doctors at Medical College and Hospital. 

 Where will I take him now? wondered Guhas relative Kalipada Das.

 Such things are bound to happen when 200 junior doctors and interns stop working, said a senior hospital official. However, no operation, emergency or planned, was cancelled.

 National Medical principal R.N. Chattopadhyay said: We talked to the junior doctors and interns today. We have also lodged a police complaint against the vandalism.

 The agitating doctors, however, said their ceasework would continue till those involved in the vandalism were punished.

 They claimed that three doctors were assaulted when a mob went on the rampage in the emergency ward after the death of a youth, allegedly because of negligence.

 The authorities have assured us that action will be taken within 24 hours against those who thrashed our colleagues and the guards at the door of the Raja Rammohan Block, where the vandalism took place. We will meet at 10am on Tuesday and decide our course of action, said Debajyoti Sur, an agitating doctor.

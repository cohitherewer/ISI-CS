 Treasures from the police past

 It is difficult to associate Raja Rammohun Roy with nautch but Fanny Parkes in her journal has gone on record as saying that performances by dancing girls were held in his stylishly done up house on Upper Circular Road, which is at 113 APC Road now. The house had to be auctioned to provide funds for the Rajas journey to England, where he died. About 40 years later it turned into Sookeas Street police station. 

 The government of Bengal acquired it in 1918. But in about 10 years time the thana had moved to Amherst Street. Thereafter, it served as the residence of senior police officers. In 1996 the central building, where the Raja used to live, was converted into a museum for Calcutta police. It looks like any other garish building now, but the galleries inside demonstrate how with a little imagination obstacles such as low budget and low tech can often be turned to advantage. The new Calcutta Police Museum and was thrown open to the public during the recent deluge.

 The idea of opening the museum was first mooted in 1990 during Calcuttas tercentenary celebrations. Only arms and ammunition were displayed at the museum when it was inaugurated. The Calcutta Police Commissionerate was established in 1856, and last year when it celebrated its 150th anniversary an exhibition was held at the Nandan complex.

 Nilina Deb Lal, who designed the museum, says it has many disparate objects and tells the story of the commissionerate. There are extracts from gazettes and memorandum, and archival photographs were used as well. An attempt has been made to tell the story behind the arms and ammunition on display. 

 Ironically, the displays, which are a good mix of snippets of information in bold letters, objects and images, highlight the activities of revolutionaries and show them in a better light than the police during the Raj. 

 There are galleries on Dhaka Anushilan Samiti and the capital conspiracy case when a bomb was thrown at Lord Hardinge while he was on elephant back, on the Alipore conspiracy case and the attack on Writers Building, and on Bina Das who had made an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the police commissioner Charles Tegart. There are maps, extracts from police orders, look out notices and proscribed literature. Many will find interesting the display of firearms, the huge bombs dropped by the Japanese, and stuff straight out of Bond such as the book bomb and other cloak-and-dagger material.

 The story continues till present times. I looked for any mention of the Naxalite movement and not in vain. It mentioned the name of the policeman killed by these extremists. 

 Faiza Huma is a young artist from Bhopal whose canvases are being exhibited at the Seagull Arts amp; Media Resources Centre. Her fragmented sentences and words in the catalogue entitled The book of life may sound pretentious, but her severely low-key works with a minimum of forms, lines and colours are stark to the point of being almost bare.

 All her canvases horizontal and vertical have a basic design. The background is the palest of greys on which she sometimes draws and puts the imprint of forms rather slivers of them. These forms look like they were culled from real life hairpins, suggestions of letters of alphabet, half moons in black split asunder, prehistoric tools, fine lines, curlicues, pipettes and burettes, and what look strangely enough like illustrations of laws of physics from school textbooks.

 All these forms are painstakingly delineated. She leaves nothing to chance. Each realistic or fantastic is almost perfectly delineated and seems to be held together by some unseen force. The colours too are limited to ochre, brown, grey. 

 So the canvases do look contemplative but after walking around the rooms and there are five in this gallery one feels one has seen too much of the same thing. There should have been some reprieve from this sameness.

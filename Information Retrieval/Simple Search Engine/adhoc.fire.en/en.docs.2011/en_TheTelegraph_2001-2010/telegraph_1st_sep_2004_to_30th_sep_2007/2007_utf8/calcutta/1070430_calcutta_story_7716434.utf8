The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tickets bane of Metro trip

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Lack of smart cards, inadequate entry and exit points, a faulty ticketing system and long queues a trip on the Metro has become trying for the passengers.

 We regularly receive complaints of non-availability of smart cards, long queues at the gates and other problems, admitted J.S. Mitra, chief operations manager, Metro Railway. The introduction of smart cards is a pilot project. We are monitoring the response. 

 Metro Railway introduced smart cards in January 2006. Sixty thousand cards were issued to passengers in about six months. The smart card-users comprise only 15 per cent of the Metro passengers.

 Faced with growing demand, the authorities have decided to place orders for another 100,000. We will start issuing the new lot in two months, said Mitra. 

 The queues at the entry and exit points of the platforms may lengthen after that. Of the 208 entry and exit points at 17 stations, only 67 are smart card-enabled. The number of smart card gates is inadequate. The queues will get longer after the new lot of cards are issued, predicted a Metro Railway official.

 Most of the ticket counters are closed throughout the day, resulting in the queues. The Metro employees can be seen chatting away while passengers sweat in the queues, complained a regular Metro commuter. 

 An official explained: There is a need to increase manpower at the ticket counters during peak hours. But that is not possible, as the men will sit idle at other times.

 The smart card gates were earlier used for entry and exit of the magnetic ticket-holders. Magnetic tickets often develop glitches. Smart cards, too, occasionally cause problems, added the official. 

 After the extension of the Metro services, all platform gates may be made smart card-enabled. There are also proposals to introduce new types of tickets, such as smart tokens or paper tickets with bar codes.

 According to Mitra, the situation will improve after a Rs 40-crore overhaul of the ticketing system. But that will happen only after Metro services are extended to Garia. Magnetic tickets are obsolete in most parts of the world. We are planning to do away with them, he said. 

 Smart tokens, which can be recycled, are the most likely replacement.

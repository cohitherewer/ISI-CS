 Tourist hub keeps cool

 When tourist Chimgainy Yoan was found bleeding profusely on Sudder Street on Sunday night, his throat slit, shockwaves rocked Calcuttas travellers hub.

 It has long been known that the road has a slightly darker, criminal underbelly, but this was one of the few instances when Sudder Street hit the headlines. 

 By Tuesday, however, life had returned to its normal rhythm, with travellers hanging around outside the scores of large and small hotels and guest houses in the area.

 Internet cafes were full of foreigners tapping out their emails home, while the cafes were chock-a-block with people stocking up on food before heading to other destinations.

 The majority of the foreigners that Metro spoke to did not feel that such an incident affected the way they perceived Calcutta. 

 Alison, from Melbourne, who has been to Calcutta several times, said: Im very surprised to hear about this incident. I have always regarded Calcutta as one of the safest cities in India to visit. I have never come across any aggressive behaviour like you do in Mumbai, and especially in Delhi.

 Another voice of surprise was Johnnys. From Harlow, in England, Johnny has travelled extensively in India, including spending five months in Varanasi.

 Its my first time in Calcutta, and so far it seems a very safe place. I hear that the man who got his throat slit was a drug addict. To be honest, that could happen to you in any city where you try to buy drugs. Compared to Colaba, in Bombay, Sudder Street feels very safe, said Johnny.

 The foreigners who had experienced problems were three young Swedes, who declined to be named. They were walking down Sudder Street on Monday, when we noticed two men trying to unzip our rucksacks to get at our wallets. They did, however, confirm that we dont get the sense that this is a violent city.

 Sergeant Arun Sarkar, of New Market police station, echoed the sentiments of the travellers, stating: There is special vigilance on Sudder Street, with a plainclothesmen constantly monitoring the area. He also paid tribute to local residents, who are, on the whole, of great help.

 Sarkar added: It is very difficult to quantify crime committed by or against foreigners. To my knowledge, no foreigner has ever been arrested in this area for any serious offence.

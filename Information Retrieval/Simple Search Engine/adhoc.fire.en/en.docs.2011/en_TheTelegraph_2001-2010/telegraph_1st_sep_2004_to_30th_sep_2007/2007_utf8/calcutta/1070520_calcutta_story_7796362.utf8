The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 BBC eyes the British past

 Leena Kejriwal at work accompanied by the BBC crew

 A four-member BBC team from Birmingham is here to film Calcutta, tracing changes since it shed its colonial past. The part on Calcutta is an episode in a documentary commissioned to celebrate 60 years of Indian Independence. 

 The BBC wanted us to do something in Calcutta because of its British past, says producer and director Sangeeta Sehdev. Divided into four segments, one part of the film is woven around new Calcutta, opposed to old Calcutta, as seen through the eyes of designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, restaurateur Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta and industrialist Harsh Neotia, among others. 

 Another part focuses on art. Theres an encounter with artist Soumitra Basak, owner of Cima Art Gallery Pratiti Basu Sen and city based photographer Leena Kejriwal who recently released a coffee table book of photographs showcasing old Calcutta. In the third section the team explores theatre in Calcutta and the interest of young theatre aspirants in pursuing English theatre. The fourth section is about Calcuttans who have faith in astrology. 

 With Calcutta, the film is looking at Mumbai and Pakistan, where two teams are shooting now. It will be aired on the Asian Network on BBC2 sometime in August.

 A fierce Norwester swept through a city in slumber early on Monday, flattening some shanties, uprooting trees and cooling things down a bit.

 The storm raged for about 20 minutes from 3 am. The city also saw a brief spell of rain on Monday evening.

 Meteorological officials said a warning for Norwester and thunderstorms had been issued for the next 48 hours.

 A lot of moisture is coming in from the Bay of Bengal and convective clouds are being formed. We expect more Norwesters and rain in the next couple of days, said G.C. Debnath, director of weather section, Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.

 The casualty list ranged from thatched huts and electricity poles in Basirhat to mud houses in Gosaba, Basanti and Kultali. Power supply to the southern suburbs of Sonarpur, Baruipur, Thakurpukur, Behala and Budge Budge was hit.

 There were reports of trees toppling on Southern Avenue, Ballygunge Circular Road, near Science City, Mayfair Road, Taratala Road, Gurusaday Dutta Road, Vivekananda Road and opposite Star theatre, slowing down traffic.

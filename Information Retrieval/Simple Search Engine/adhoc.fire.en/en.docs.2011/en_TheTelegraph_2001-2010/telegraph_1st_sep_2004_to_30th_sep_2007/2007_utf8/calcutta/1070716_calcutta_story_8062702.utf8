 A man in his mid-30s, suspected to be a thief, was lynched in an advocates house on DC Dey Road on Sunday morning, hours before his lecturer daughters wedding.

 Entally police station, which is five minutes from the house, was alerted more than two hours after the man, who is yet to be identified, was caught. The officers took him to NRS Hospital, where he died.

 According to the police, the man was kicked and punched for over an hour, resulting in internal haemorrhage that led to his death.

 About 20 guests were staying over at Suprojit Sardars house on Saturday night for the marriage of his daughter Rituparna, who teaches law, on Sunday afternoon. The advocate, who works in Sealdah court, said that around 3.45am, his wife Parul heard whispers outside the room she was sleeping in.

 We had turned in around 1.30am after electricians finished their work. My son Avijit was with my wife in the room next to the courtyard, said Suprojit.

 Parul opened the door and saw three men outside, said the family members in their statement. She started screaming. The guests came out immediately. Two of the men managed to run away but the third was caught, recounted Suprojit.

 The deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division), Parthasarathi Ghosh, said: No weapons were used but the man was kicked and punched hard. He was injured in the head and behind the ears.

 Suprojit, however, said the man was only slapped and it was a natural reaction. We did not beat him hard enough to cause serious injury. When we handed him over to the police, he walked to the jeep, he claimed. 

 But Ghosh said that the family informed the police station around 5.30pm, nearly two hours after the man was caught and overpowered. The officers found him unconscious in the courtyard. The family members should have informed us immediately.

 The deputy commissioner stated that a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder would be started soon. Our men are trying to find out who had beaten up the deceased, he said.

 This is the second case of lynching in the city in two months. On May 26, a mob led by women beat to death extortionist Dom Pradip in Chetla Lockgate.

 The deputy commissioner (headquarters), Gyanwant Singh, said: Dom Pradips lynching was an outburst of peoples anger against him. The mob assaulted him with an intention of killing him. But Sundays was an isolated incident. I dont think the family and the guests wanted to kill the man.

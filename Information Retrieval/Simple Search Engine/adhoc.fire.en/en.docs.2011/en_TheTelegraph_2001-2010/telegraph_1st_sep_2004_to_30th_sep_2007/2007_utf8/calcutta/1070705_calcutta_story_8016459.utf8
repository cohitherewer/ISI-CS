 Plea for HC intervention

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday allowed petitions seeking specific orders to the civic authorities of Calcutta and Howrah to tackle waterlogging.

 You can file an application before the appropriate forum of the court, demanding its intervention into the matter, Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar told the petitioners. 

 In the morning session, advocates Tapas Bhanja and Idris Ali apprised the chief justice about the hazards faced by the people because of waterlogging. The civic bodies have failed to tackle the situation. Appropriate steps are not being taken to address the problem, alleged the lawyers.

 Environment activist Subhas Dutta, who was present in the court, told the judge that he had found out that outlets to drain rainwater are almost non-existent. The canals, through which the water used to flow out, are choked. Until they are dredged, the waterlogging wont stop. Dutta said he could produce photographs to substantiate his claim.

 The chief justice observed that there is waterlogging in the city every monsoon.

 Dutta stated that the problem would become worse if the government and the civic authorities did not take remedial measures.

 The chief justice asked him and the two lawyers to file petitions in this regard.

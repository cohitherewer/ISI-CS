 The Israeli embassy has organised an exhibition of maps and artefacts tracing the development of Hebrew language at Indian Museums Asutosh Birth Centenary Hall.

 The exhibition, which was inaugurated on Monday, will mark Israeli ambassador David Danielis last official trip to Calcutta. Speaking of his four years in India Danieli said: I have made many friends here. I feel that a great deal has been achieved in the relations between the two countries. I am proud that my last official trip to Calcutta involves this exhibition.

 Also present at the inauguration was honorary consul of Israel in Calcutta and chairman of Ambuja Realty Group Harsh Neotia. It has been truly wonderful to work with David Danieli and I hope to see more of him, hopefully in both Calcutta and Israel, said Neotia.

 German Consul for Calcutta Gnter Wehrmann lit a diya with Danieli and Neotia to launch the show.

 The exhibition comprises two parts. The first part is a collection of maps, some of which go as far back as AD 556. Maps from the 19th and early 20th Centuries are also displayed.

 The second part of the exhibition traces the development of the Hebrew language, with exhibits from all over the world, including India, Iran, Turkey, Germany and Morocco.

 The photographs and exhibits include Torah scrolls, marriage contracts and photographs of synagogue ceilings. All the items on display have been labelled by experts.

 Danieli observed: The development of Hebrew language has, in fact, been quite conservative. The remarkable thing is that we are still able to read Hebrew texts that were written thousands of years ago. 

 Neotia said: This kind of an exhibition is invaluable because it provides students a great opportunity and access to information on the roots of the Hebrew language and the early depictions of Jerusalem.

 The exhibition will continue till July 2.

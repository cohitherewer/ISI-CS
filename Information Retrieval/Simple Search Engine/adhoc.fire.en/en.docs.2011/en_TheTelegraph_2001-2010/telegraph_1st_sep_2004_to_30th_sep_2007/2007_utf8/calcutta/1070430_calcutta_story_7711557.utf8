 Dreams come true

 - Story of migration, struggle amp; success

 A STAFF REPORTER

 1952: Sumer Chand Mehta, 73, along with a handful of ambitious youths from the desert city of Jodhpur, come to Calcutta in search of better job and business prospects. 

 2007: The Jodhpur community makes its presence felt in various fields, like business and the corporate world.

 The Jodhpur Association, formed in 1967, stands witness to the struggle and success of a few young men with dreams in their eyes. 

 My father came here in 1952 when he was just 18. Many bright and educated young men accompanied him for better prospects in Calcutta, said Shekhar Mehta, president, Jodhpur Association. With just a few rupees in their pockets, they rose to the heights of success in all fields.

 The association became the platform for those coming from Jodhpur and has supported many. 

 The first generation became chartered accountants. With their support, the second generation fulfilled their dreams. Our third generation is the most dynamic. Many of our girls have become successful corporate executives. The association kept us together. It made us feel at home and gave us support, smiled Mehta. 

 The association, which started with around 30 families and now boasts 500 families, will be celebrating its 40th anniversary on May 1. Besides, the association has also supported rural women and underprivileged children. From micro credit for rural women and free heart surgeries for children at Rabindranath Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences to educational support and fund-raising events, the association has been a part of it all.

 Our social work is our tribute to the city which has helped us grow. We want to do something for the people of the state as well. We have organised micro credit for rural women. We will also sponsor the education of underprivileged children, said Mehta.

 As part of the anniversary celebration on May 1, the Jodhpur Association will organise an in-house colourful cultural programme.

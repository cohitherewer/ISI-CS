 The therapeutic value of dance helps to heal people with mental problems

 They have performed across the globe, even at Britains House of Commons. However, for this group of dancers, it is not the performances but the process of healing that they start which counts.

 Kolkata Sanved specialises in using dance for recovery and healing of victims of violence and trafficking. The members have recently started helping people with mental health problems.

 Dance therapy for mental ailments is challenging and calls for an approach different from that adopted for trafficked children and victims of violence. For example, rapid movements can be used for those affected by violence, but they would not be effective for mental health patients, explained Ashoka Fellow Sohini Chakraborty, founder-director of Kolkata Sanved, which was set up in 2004.

 The organisation started working with Anjali, an NGO, at Lumbini Park Mental Hospital and Clinic in November 2006. People took time to get used to the concept of using dance for therapy, said Chakraborty.

 A Masters in sociology and a trained dancer, Chakraborty for a long time wanted to use dance differently. She realised the therapeutic value of movements while working as a dance teacher in a shelter run by NGO Sanlaap for victims of violence and trafficking.

 People subjected to violence, especially trafficked women, are uncomfortable about their bodies. Through dance, I wanted to give their bodies back to them, said Chakraborty. 

 Dance therapy is also being used by danseuse Mandar Mukherjee to rehabilitate inmates of Antara Mental Hospital. Using the concept of aesthetic therapy, she has been collaborating with singer Aniruddha Singha to heal sub-acute patients.

 Most of the patients are on medication and suffer from lethargy and short attention span. Through song and dance we try to make them work together and provide them a medium of self expression, explained Mukherjee. 

 According to her, the emotional response of the patients to aesthetic therapy indicates that it has boosted their healing through other forms of therapy.

 Dance therapy has also made its way into schools like Patha Bhavan, where Sampurnata, a course created by Chakraborty, has been made a part of the curriculum. Concerned about the lack of playgrounds and to promote cooperation among students, Patha Bhavan primary school has incorporated dance therapy in the curriculum, stated Chakraborty.

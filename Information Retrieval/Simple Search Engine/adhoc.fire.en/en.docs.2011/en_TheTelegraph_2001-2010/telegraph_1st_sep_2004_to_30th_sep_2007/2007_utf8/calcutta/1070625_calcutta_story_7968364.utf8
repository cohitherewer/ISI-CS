 Illegal car park razed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bidhannagar Municipality officials razed an illegal elevation on the service road, used as a car park, outside the HSBC call centre at Karunamoyee, close to Bidyut Bhavan, on Sunday. 

 We received a complaint from our drainage department that someone had illegally elevated and metalled the service road for parking vehicles. As no one has taken permission from the municipality for the construction, we decided to remove it, said Tapas Chowdhury, chief executive officer, Bidhannagar Municipality. 

 Civic officials and police went to the spot on Sunday morning and found many cars parked on the elevation, while the service road was inundated with water. Our drainage department officials had earlier found that the elevation had choked the sewer in the area, and was causing the water accumulation, said Chowdhury.

 Workers of the municipality, armed with pickaxes and shovels, dug up the illegal parking space on a 100-ft stretch of the service road adjacent to the call centre.

 The municipality, however, couldnt identify who had made the elevation. Many organisations, both government and private, used to park their vehicles there. We dont know who ordered the construction, said the chief executive officer.

 We have no knowledge of the illegal elevation and were, in no way connected with its making, said an HSBC official.

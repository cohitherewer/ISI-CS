 Clinic death sets off case

 - NEGLIGENCE CRY BY KIN

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder has been started against a doctor and the authorities of a Gariahat nursing home, following a complaint by the husband of a patient who died at the clinic on Wednesday evening.

 Kallol Saha alleged that his wife, Nabanita, 29, had died due to the negligence of the doctor and the nursing home authorities.

 Nabanita, a Tollygunge resident, was admitted to the clinic on Tuesday. Hours later, she underwent a Caesarean section and gave birth to a boy. 

 On Wednesday, her condition started worsening. No doctor was around. By the time the nurses turned up, she had nearly collapsed. They took her to the ITU, but she died a while later, said a relative. 

 Nabanita, like her husband, was on the panel of public prosecutors at Alipore court.

 We have started a case based on the complaint, said an officer of Gariahat police station. We are trying to find out whether the woman died because of negligence.

 The nursing home authorities refused to comment.

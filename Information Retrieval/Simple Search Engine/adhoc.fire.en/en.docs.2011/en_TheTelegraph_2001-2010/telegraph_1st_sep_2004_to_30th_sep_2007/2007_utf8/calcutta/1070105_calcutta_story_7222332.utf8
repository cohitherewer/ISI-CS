 Meet the bull-fighter

 Inside the Actors Studio makes a great start to the New Year this Sunday with Benicio Del Toro (in picture with Brittany Murphy) taking the guests chair. Bursting on to the big screen in 1995 with Bryan Singers The Usual Suspects, Del Toro had become the youngest James Bond villain, in Licence to Kill, at age 22.

 Learn on the show how Del Toro (of the bull in Spanish) got bitten by the acting bug even while attending the University of California at San Diego for a business degree. He, of course, went on to emerge as one of the most charismatic character actors with films like Traffic, 21 Grams and Sin City.

 Along with great tips from the man himself on how he approaches his acting, get to know a bag full of trivia on Ben. That he was a basketball star at Mercersburg Academy, not an actor. Whats more, in 1998 Del Toro gained 40 pounds and burned himself with cigarettes repeatedly for the elevator scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And after all that the shots of the burn were finally cut out from the film!

 Del Toro also reveals how he walked out on Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, where he was originally cast as Darth Maul, after most of his lines were removed.

 The show starts at 7 pm on PIX.

 Tips on baggage security

 A STAFF REPORTER

Airlines are trying to educate passengers on carrying valuables, stung by an increasing number of complaints of theft.

 Indian (airline) has started random check of baggage at various points where it is handled by the ground staff. 

 In the X-ray area, if the baggage is found to contain cash, jewellery or other valuables, the passenger is requested to transfer them into the cabin baggage, said an official of the airline.

 If the passenger is not carrying a cabin bag or is unwilling to take out the valuables from the registered baggage, security officers request them to declare the assets. If they provide us with a list of valuables, the baggage is earmarked for special vigil, the official added.

 This, he pointed out, will not only minimise the risk of theft, but will also ensure that the passenger gets proper compensation if the valuables get lost. Passengers are also being assisted to lodge complaints with police for any loss of luggage or valuables.

 Earlier, passengers often ignored general appeals made by various airlines not to carry valuables in registered luggage.

 Airport sources said first-time fliers are most vulnerable to thefts. The number of first-time fliers has gone up at Calcutta airport three to four times over the past few years. Most of them are not aware of the rules, an official said.

 Jet Airways has directed its officials at the airport to guide passengers at the check- in points on how to carry valuables.

 Singapore Airlines is working on plans to provide proper guidance at the check-in points at the airport on transferring valuables to hand baggage.

 Police officers at Calcutta airport suspect that a section of the ground-handling staff is involved in the theft of valuables.

 When a bag is flown to a wrong destination and later traced, it is kept in the airline office for a long time before it is loaded on to another aircraft. Unscrupulous ground- handling employees take this opportunity to break the bag and take away valuables when no one is keeping vigil, said an officer at Calcutta airport.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Mariah Carey

 You have an immense capacity to work. You have the ability to do several things simultaneously. However, it is a good idea to lower your pace at times. You are always convinced that there is a way to improve the present state of affairs. You are a great learner from experiences and never repeat the same mistake. Others trust you, knowing you will never let them down. It is good to have high ideals, but do not always expect this of others.

 Kusum Bhandari

 Buddy hunt in bar death

 - Mystery man in black stepped out as Bally resident choked

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A 55-year-old Bally Municipality employee fell ill in a central Calcutta bar on Sunday and later died, soon after his drinking partner stepped out and did not return. 

 The man in black his shirt, 

 trousers and shades were all of the colour who was drinking 

 with Moloy Bhattacharya (picture on left by Sanat Kumar 

 Sinha), went out as if to buy a packet of cigarettes, 

 said the waiters in the Free School Street bar.

 Within minutes, the civic employee started complaining of uneasiness. He coughed for several minutes, held his chest and threw up a few times, before collapsing in his seat. He died 45 minutes later in Medical College and Hospital.

 The body has been sent for post-mortem. New Market police, who are investigating the case, have sought opinion from doctors.

 The other man, aged about 35, did not return to the bar. The police are looking for him.

 We have collected some information about Bhattacharyas drinking partner. We have found pieces of paper in Bhattacharyas shirt pocket, bearing details of his provident fund account and the business card of a travel agency, said a senior officer of the police station. No one has lodged a complaint about the death so far.

 Bhattacharya lived in Bally with his wife. Their thalassaemic son died about five years ago. He walked into the bar with the man in black around 1pm. They ordered a beer, whisky and soda. The other man stepped out after a round of drinks. 

 When Bhattacharya threw up a few times, the bar employees called up the owner, who informed the police station. The officers took the gasping man to Medical College and Hospital.

 We called up Bhattacharyas wife. She said her husband had left their residence around 11am, said one of the investigators.

 Bhattacharyas brother-in-law Shibabrata Chakrabarty claimed to have a received a call from him around 12.30pm, asking him to be home to receive one of his good friends from Siliguri whom he had just met and was very impressed with.

 Bhattacharya had even suggested that Chakrabarty start a sari business with his friend from Siliguri, said the brother-in-law.

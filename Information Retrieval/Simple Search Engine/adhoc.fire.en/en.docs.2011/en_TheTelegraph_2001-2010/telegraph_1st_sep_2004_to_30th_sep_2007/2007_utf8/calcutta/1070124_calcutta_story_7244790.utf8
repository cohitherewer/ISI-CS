The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green ranks swell

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With the authorities failing the people in protecting the citys environment, a few conscientious citizens have come forward to guard the greens. 

 On Tuesday, a group of green activists and citizens with concern for the environment came together under the banner of the newly-formed Calcutta Green Network to announce their plans to protect the Maidan from the marauders set to stage another Book Fair on it.

 The primary objective of Calcutta Green Network is to protect the Maidan, which constitutes 60 per cent of the citys greenery. We strongly condemn the decision by the army, state government, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the state pollution control board to allow the Book Fair on the Maidan, said green activist Subhas Dutta, a member of the forum.

 Fairs such as Industrial India Trade Fair, that used to be held on the Maidan, have shifted to other parts of the city. But the Book Fair, which does most damage to the greens, continues to be held with the blessings of the authorities. 

 Australia is the theme of Book Fair 2007. We will write to the Australian high commission, informing it that the fair is being organised by flouting environmental norms. We will ask if such thing is allowed in that country, said Dutta.

 The forum has organised a rally from Victoria Memorial to Patton Tank Point, on Red Road, on Wednesday afternoon to protest the damage being done to Calcuttas lungs.

 E-bomb ticks away

 The problem of electronic waste is assuming ominous proportions in the city, two independent studies have found. 

 Electronic waste, or e-waste, comprises discarded electronic devices from computers, televisions and airconditioners to cellphones, compact discs and calculators.

 A study carried out by Delhi-based Toxic Link, with Centre for Quality Management of Jadavpur University, has found that Calcutta is now a major electronic waste-recycling hub in the country.

 According to the study, the city generates about 9,000 tonnes of e-waste annually. The quantity of e-waste traded and recycled in the city may be much more. E-waste from other states also lands up here, said Satish Sinha, the associate director of Toxic Link.

 The other study carried out by the Calcutta Universitys environmental sciences department, along with the city-based Environment Governed Integrated Organisation, found that landline sets and cellphones constitute half the citys e-waste, and discarded computers, 17 per cent.

 The number of electronic devices being used and discarded has increased significantly in the past few years. The problem will worsen unless there is proper management of the waste, said Aniruddha Mukherjee of Calcutta University. Currently, most of the waste is illegally recycled or dumped indiscriminately.

 The study found that Chandni Chowk is a major recycling zone. The waste generated in Calcutta is often disposed of in Dhapa and the sewage channels.

 The Toxic Link study has identified Chandni Chowk, Prinsep Street, Maniktala, Phoolbagan, Kadapara, Rajarhat and Howrah as e-waste hotspots.

 The study makes shocking disclosures about organised recycling of e-waste, said Sadhan Ghosh of Jadavpur University, who was part of the Toxic Link study.

 Constituents of e-waste, like lead, cadmium, mercury, chromium and beryllium, are known to be extremely toxic and are often carcinogenic, said an expert associated with the Calcutta University study.

 Nothing concrete has been done about managing e-waste, though it falls under the hazardous category, said a state pollution control board official.

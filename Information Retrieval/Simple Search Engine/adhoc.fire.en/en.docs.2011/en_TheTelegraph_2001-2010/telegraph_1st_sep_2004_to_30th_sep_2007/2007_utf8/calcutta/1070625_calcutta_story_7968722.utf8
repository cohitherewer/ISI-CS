 Frown on schools taking saints name in vain 

 MITA MUKHERJEE 

 The Sainthood days of several schools in and around the city are numbered.

 The Association of Christian Schools has drawn up a list of all schools run by over 85 Christian missionary and Anglo-Indian trust bodies, in Calcutta and the districts. This excludes schools not worthy of their prefix Saint (St). It will now urge the government not to treat these institutions on a par with reputed schools named after saints.

 The demand along with the list of schools will be placed before state school education minister Partha De on July 5, when the Act being framed to regulate all private schools will be discussed.

 Our stand is clear. Before finalising the provisions of the Act, the government should not mix up these schools with the reputed ones run by us. These schools have no links with Christian missionaries or the Anglo-Indian trusts. Some claim they are controlled by missionaries, but offer very poor educational facilities in exchange of high fees. They are not only cheating innocent guardians and students but are also causing confusion in the government, said Herod Mullick, general secretary of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, a key member of the association.

 Since minority institutions enjoy certain privileges, the state government has decided to create a special section for them in the proposed Act. The Association of Christian Schools is clear that schools should get into this section on merit and not through a name game.

 Just because a school is named after a saint, it does not mean that it is run by a Christian missionary or by an Anglo-Indian body. We cannot allow these underperforming schools to tarnish the image of missionary schools. Not a single such institution should enjoy the rights of a minority school, said Father Faustine Brank, president of the education cell of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba.

 Education department officials said that the government does not have a separate machinery in place to verify the claims of schools demanding minority status. We consider a school to be a minority institution if it has a certificate from the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions. We will definitely consider the Parisebas demand, said Santosh Mahapatra, joint secretary, school education department.

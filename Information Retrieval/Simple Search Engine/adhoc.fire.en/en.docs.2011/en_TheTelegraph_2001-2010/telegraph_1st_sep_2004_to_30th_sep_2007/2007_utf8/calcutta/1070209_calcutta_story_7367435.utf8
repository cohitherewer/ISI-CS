The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Volcanic turnout, damp end

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 Theres nothing worse than a graveyard atmosphere, and the ambience at Lords can, on occasion, be just that. 

 Although the Barmy Army have made proceedings livelier in the last decade or so, it still, and probably will always, lack the intensity of a football match, or, of course, an international at Eden Gardens.

 The Maidan on Thursday afternoon was inundated with fans being herded down enclosed paths towards the gates. 

 Getting into the stadium was, in fact, easier than one might have imagined. I have queued for much longer in English sports stadiums. 

 The rules on what can and cant be brought into the stadium are markedly more stringent than in England, where it was only relatively recently that one could bring a cooler bag full of beer into the stands. 

 The crowd reached fever pitch as Zaheer Khan ran up to deliver the first ball. However, the first real celebration naturally took place a few overs later, when Munaf Patel sent Tharangas stumps flying. The celebrations at Lords seemed rather tame in comparison to this volcanic display.

 I have never seen so many flags of any nationality all in one place. The local flag makers must have smacked their lips when it was announced that the first ODI was being shifted to Calcutta. There is very little flag waving at England matches.

 Cricket is very much a family game in England, with many women coming to matches. That was not really the same at Eden, where the gender imbalance was much greater.

 My seat was near where Sourav Ganguly was fielding. Every time Dada turned round and walked towards the boundary, people almost fell over each other to wave and shout encouragement at the big man. 

 Alas, there was one factor that the Sri Lanka match at Eden Gardens shared with English matches: rain. 

 While one horizon looked rather pleasant, the other looked dark grey and ominous. The forces of darkness stole the match away, with an appalling downpour forcing the suspension of play. 

 The odd flash of lightning and crack of thunder diverted the crowds attention, the pessimists who brought raincoats and umbrellas donning their protection. 

 Slowly and sadly, people began to lose heart, with some dodging the almost horizontal rain to get to the exits. Clasping a forlorn and increasingly unlikely re-admission ticket, Eden Gardens emptied back into the city.

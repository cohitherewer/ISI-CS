 It's Your Birthday So...

 Its your birthday, so...

 You like to be at the centre of the action, yet you need your intellectual and emotional space. You always want to be true to yourself, even if it makes you unpopular. You have a tendency to leap before you look. You have the ability to let go of habits, people and negative circumstances. Kusum Bhandari

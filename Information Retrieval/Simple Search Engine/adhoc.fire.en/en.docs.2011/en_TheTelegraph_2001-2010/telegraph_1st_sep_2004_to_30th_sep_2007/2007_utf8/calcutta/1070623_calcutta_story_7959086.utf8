 The forest department has cut down on the number of saplings it plants during Forestry Week, which starts on July 14 this year.

 The decision follows the felling of 53 neem trees on VIP Road, around Lake Town, by outdoor advertising agencies for better display of their billboards. 

 Forest minister Ananta Roy, who is in Darjeeling to attend Forestry Week there, said he would write to the mayor, requesting him to take steps against the outdoor advertising agencies.

 There is no point in planting so many trees and spending lakhs of rupees for their maintenance when people are not bothered about our efforts and are mercilessly cutting trees for their own needs, said Roy.

 Last year, the forestry department had planted over 100,000 saplings in and around the city and distributed 140,000 saplings among clubs and other organisations. This year, the department will plant 70,000 saplings and distribute 100,000 saplings among civic bodies, clubs and other organisations.

 I will request the mayor to talk to the outdoor advertising agencies regarding felling of trees. The civic bodies themselves need to be a little more careful while carrying out construction work or repairs. We have found saplings damaged by construction work time and again, Roy added.

 Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya promised to help the forest department if it approached him. We would all like to see a green Calcutta. If they write to me, the civic body will take up the matter, said the mayor.

 If we find that clubs and other organisations are interested in planting trees and maintaining them, we might distribute more saplings among them, said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests (urban forestry).

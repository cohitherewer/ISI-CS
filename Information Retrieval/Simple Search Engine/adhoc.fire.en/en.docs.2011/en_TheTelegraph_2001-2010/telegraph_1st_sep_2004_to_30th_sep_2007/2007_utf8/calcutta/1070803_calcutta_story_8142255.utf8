A domestic help of a businessman was arrested on Thursday evening on charges of stealing jewellery and other valuables, worth more than Rs 6 lakh, from his employers apartment on CIT Road, in Beleghata.

 Hemandra Jadav, a resident of Banka district, in Bihar, was caught with the booty in Babughat, around 12 hours after the crime.

 The valuables were in the safe, which Jadav had opened with its key. The owner of the flat, Kailash Marodia, woke up and found Rs 65,000, 15 kg of silver bars and gold ornaments weighing 50 gm cleaned out. Jadav, too, was missing, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 The way the theft was carried out suggested that Jadav was the culprit. We launched a hunt for him, said an officer of Beleghata police station.

 Six teams, including men from the detective departments anti-burglary wing, were engaged to track down Jadav. We knew he would try to leave the city at the earliest. Plainclothesmen carrying Jadavs picture were deployed at Sealdah and Howrah stations and also long-distance bus terminuses at Esplanade and Babughat, the officer added.

 The team posted at Babughat spotted Jadav roaming in the area with a leather bag on his shoulder. We intercepted him and searched his bag and found all the stolen items inside, said a team member.

 Jadav reportedly told the police during interrogation that he had chalked out the plan to commit the theft a couple of months ago.

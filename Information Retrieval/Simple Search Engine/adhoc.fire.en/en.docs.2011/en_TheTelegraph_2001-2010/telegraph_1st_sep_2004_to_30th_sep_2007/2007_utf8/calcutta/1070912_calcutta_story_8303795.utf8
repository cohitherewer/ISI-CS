 Stabbing stares: A leching session on the roadside. A Telegraph file picture 

 Suicide by youngsters over misunderstandings with parents has sadly become common (CU girl hangs herself, August 1). The basic reason behind the suicide by the postgraduate student of psychology seems to be the same. Problems over selection of a match was only the immediate provocation. 

 Parents often fail to give due importance to the opinions and preferences of their children, even after they have become adults. This can lead to serious consequences. 

 Many children now grow up without the company of their parents for the better part of the day. This makes the process of bonding very difficult. The children, in some cases, feel that they are being neglected by their parents. Lack of faith and confidence among parents and children can destroy many families. 

 With love and affection, parents can win the respect and confidence of children. But the willingness to adjust is rarely seen. Hence, parents should not deprive their children of company in the first place.

 Apropos the report Dad, crowd catch girls molester, August 2, parents in Calcutta seldom relax when their young girls go out for classes or work. But we still raise our voice and proudly proclaim that the law and order situation is satisfactory in Calcutta. 

 Even if parents accompany their daughters, theres little they can do as is evident from the report. The girls should learn how to defend themselves instead of depending on the lawkeepers.

 Stringent punishment is the only way to control eveteasing. The molestation of a girl in presence of her father on an autorickshaw indicates the extent of the problem. Reports of school teachers molesting students and executives sexually harassing their colleagues are common. The potential culprits must be made to think of the consequences before they try to harass a girl. The time has come to make eveteasing a non-bailable offence. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 It is ridiculous on the part of a psychologist to state that people commit acts like molestation failing to control their impulse (Tease an impulse illness, August 2). Had the public been united enough to protest or the administration been sincere enough to punish, the molesters would not have dared to exhibit their illness. The brutes are well aware that they can get away with anything, thanks to an indifferent public and callous administration. The case of Jagannath Dey is an example of molesters triumphing over civic society. Impulse disorder indirectly justifies boorish acts.

 Apropos the report Coaching centres in scam glare, August 7, it is difficult to comprehend how the administration can be so matter-of-fact about dummy candidates appearing in the Joint Entrance Examination. Even the Opposition is strangely quiet about the issue. I fear the impact of the scam on the minds of the students who are preparing for the entrance test. The examination system needs to be overhauled to make it fair and transparent.

 Corruption is the biggest industry in India since Independence. So, there is nothing to be surprised about in the Joint Entrance Examination scam. Those who have been arrested are the well-established and well-connected. As a result they will be freed within the next couple of months.

Apropos the report End of road for rickshaw, August 2, it is inhuman on the part of the chief minister to ban hand-pulled rickshaws. The vehicle is a part of the citys heritage and is very useful when Calcutta goes under water during monsoon. It is a very convenient mode of transport for the elderly. What is pathetic is that the ban has deprived thousands of poor people of a livelihood. Unfortunately, no alternative source of income has been provided to them. The high courts role in the matter has also been disappointing.

 Apropos the report Rogue drivers roam scot-free, August 29, the bus which ran over Anutosh and Madhumita Majumdar on August 14 does not belong to Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. It is a private bus operated by Joy Travels to ferry students of the school. It also ferries students of other schools in and around Salt Lake. On the day of the mishap, the bus was plying with students of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan but the school was, in no way, responsible or connected with the mishap. We condemn rash driving and have had talks with the private bus services. 

 A. Chatterjee,

 principal, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan 

Apropos the report Determination conquers adversity, August 29, Kalpana Kundu earns Rs 150 per month, and not per day as was mentioned in the story. The error is regretted.

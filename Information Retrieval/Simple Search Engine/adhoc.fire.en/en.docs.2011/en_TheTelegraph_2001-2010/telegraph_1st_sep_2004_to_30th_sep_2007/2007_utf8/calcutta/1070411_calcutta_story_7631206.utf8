 Foul air after dark

 - Tools absent to monitor pollution

 THE POISON WE BREATHE: Night traffic in Calcutta. A Telegraph picture

 Calcuttas foul air gets more polluted every night. But neither traffic police nor the transport department has any system to check the poison fume-emitting vehicles that move into the city after dark. And the chances of having a monitoring system in place in the near future are bleak.

 At a meeting in the state chief secretarys office on Tuesday, Calcutta Police expressed its inability to carry out an effective pollution-monitoring exercise.

 Deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim, who attended the meeting, observed: Calcutta Police does not have the infrastructure to check vehicular pollution at night, which is not very feasible either. 

 Four months ago, in the context of a public interest litigation filed by green activist Subhas Dutta, the environment department had directed the police to arrange automobile pollution checks at night. 

 A year ago, the transport secretary had informed the high court that neither his department nor the traffic police had the means to check auto emission in the city from 11 pm to 8 am.

 Tuesdays meeting saw transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, member-secretary of the state pollution control board Debal Roy and senior law officer of the environment department Biswajit Mukherjee discussing pollution in the city at night. 

 Environment activists like Dutta are not happy with the state of affairs. The traffic at night is hardly 10 per cent of the day-time traffic. The data clearly indicates that the high pollution load is a result of fumes emitted by trucks and other heavy vehicles that ply in the city at night, said Dutta. 

 He expressed concern at the state governments inability to devise a pollution monitoring system.

 According to environmentalists, pollution at night warrants more attention. The respirable particulate matter (RPM), an index of the pollution level, is increasing daily. On an average, the RPM count of Calcutta is 86.4 micrograms per cubic metre by day. At night, the figure goes up to 97.7 micrograms per cubic metre.

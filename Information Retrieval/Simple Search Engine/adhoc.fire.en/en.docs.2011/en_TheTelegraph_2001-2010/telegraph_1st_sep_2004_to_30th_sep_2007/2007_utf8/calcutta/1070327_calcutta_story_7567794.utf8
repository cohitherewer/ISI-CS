The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Delayed Bypass flyover set to rise

 KINSUK BASU

 After dragging its feet for almost three years, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is finally set to start construction of the Ultadanga flyover next week. 

 The 1,200-metre flyover, connecting the EM Bypass with VIP Road, is expected to be ready in a year and a half. Contractors for the Rs 40-crore project, being funded under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, have been empanelled.

 One end of the flyover will be on the EM Bypass, where it turns towards Ultadanga. It will extend over the service road and take a 90-degree turn to descend on VIP Road. 

 The project is expected to cut short the journey from south Calcutta to the airport, via the Bypass. 

 The project was delayed as a result of some technical problems. We have managed to iron out the glitches. The work is set to begin soon. Once ready, the flyover is expected to be of great help to those who want to reach VIP Road from the Bypass, says CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar. 

 According to CMDA officials, the state government wanted to take up the project with a private partner. But the plan did not work out, delaying the project. 

 It has been decided that work will start at the Bypass end of the flyover and proceed towards VIP Road. The technical staff of Consulting Engineering Services would oversee the construction, along with the CMDA engineers.

 The two major problems with the original plan were a 132 KV CESC line and an 18-ft-deep drain in the area. We didnt want to stop midway in the project. So, we chalked out a second plan, taking care of the problems, said CMDA chief engineer (traffic and transportation department) Debdas Bhattacharya. 

 Soil testing for the flyover is scheduled to start in a week, followed by construction of the concrete piers. The steel girders will then be put in place and interconnected.

 We have worked out the plan in such a way that vehicles using the flyover can maintain an average speed of 60-65 kph. The piling and other work will be carried out accordingly, said a senior CMDA engineer.

 Kalighat contempt charge 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Kali temple: Still in grip of pandas?

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday issued contempt rules against the president, secretary and two members of the Kalighat Temple Committee, asking why contempt proceedings should not be drawn against them for not obeying its guideline relating to the daily puja.

 Justice Girish Gupta passed the order on a petition moved by Ashok Haldar, a sevait who had alleged that the committee had failed to follow the guidelines framed by the court to conduct daily puja at the temple. 

 Moving the petition in July 2005, Haldars counsel, Pradip Roy, had alleged that some paladars had committed contempt by not following high court orders on the daily functioning of the temple.

 Another contempt petition, moved by a devotee, Prahlad Goenka, against the pandas of the temple, was still pending before the court. 

 In another order, the court had asked the pandas of the temple not to enter the sanctum sanctorum to offer puja on behalf of devotees. Yet, Goenka alleged, the pandas were still entering the area.

 The temple committee was earlier ordered by the court to follow the guidelines framed by the high court and the Supreme Court on the daily puja and the functioning of the shrine. Justice Gupta, who had issued the order, had restrained sevaits, who take turns to perform puja, from selling their palas to outsiders.

 The committee will be responsible for the puja if a sevait refuses to accept his pala. The panel should also ensure that the daily puja schedule is maintained properly, the judge had ruled. The lawyer alleged that the committee was not maintaining proper accounts of the offerings and the gold ornaments of the deity. The court should ask the committee to place the accounts before it, the lawyer said.

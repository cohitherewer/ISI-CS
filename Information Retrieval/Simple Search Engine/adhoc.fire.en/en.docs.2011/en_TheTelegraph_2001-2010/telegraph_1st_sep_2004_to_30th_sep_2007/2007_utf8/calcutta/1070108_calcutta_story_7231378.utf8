 Land nod for third campus

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Jadavpur University is likely to get 100 acres in Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city, to set up its third campus.

 Responding to a proposal submitted by the university to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the state government has said that it is exploring all possibilities to allot 100 acres in Baruipur to the 50-year-old institution.

 We had submitted the proposal to the government in August. The land and land reforms department has recently written back to us. The response is very positive, said Parthapratim Biswas, member of the universitys executive council.

 The university authorities plan to approach land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and his officials to expedite the process of handing over of the plot.

 The new campus, the other two are in Jadavpur and Salt Lake will be on a par with an IIT campus. 

 We will have well-equipped laboratories, modern workshops, residential estates for teachers and staff members, students hostels, auditoriums, seminar halls, gyms, swimming pools and guest houses, an official said. 

 The campus will become operational in the next five years.

 The university has carried out a survey of the area in Baruipur and prepared a land-use map.

 The official said the plots identified by the university are not multi-crop and are suitable for setting up an educational institution.

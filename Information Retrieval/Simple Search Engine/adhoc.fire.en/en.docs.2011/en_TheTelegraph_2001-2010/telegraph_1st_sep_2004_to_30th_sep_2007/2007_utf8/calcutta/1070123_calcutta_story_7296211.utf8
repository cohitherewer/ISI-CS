The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Direct flight to Goa

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fly straight to Goa from Calcutta next winter.

 Low-fare airline SpiceJet is planning to introduce non-stop flights between Calcutta and Goa from the winter of 2007. Having strengthened our operations in eastern and southern India, our target now is western India, Siddhanta Sharma, CEO, SpiceJet Ltd, said on Monday.

 He was announcing the launch of the airlines Calcutta-Hyderabad daily flight from February 4. The airline also plans to fly to Jaipur and Ahmedabad from Calcutta in a few months.

 A non-stop flight should not take more than two-and-a- half-hours to reach Goa from Calcutta. The journey time now is much more, as there is no direct flight, said Sharma.

 According to the initial plan, the flight will leave Calcutta at noon and reach the seaside destination at 2.30 pm. 

 Goa is an extremely popular tourist spot, visited by 10-12 per cent of domestic passengers from the eastern region, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India. Once direct flights start, the number will increase significantly.

 SpiceJets Calcutta-Hyderabad flight will leave Calcutta at 2.15 pm and reach the destination at 4.15 pm. The lowest fare on the route for a round trip is Rs 1,800, excluding taxes. The airline will operate Boeing 737-800 series aircraft that can seat 189 passengers, all in the economy class.

 Sharma said the airline was registering an encouraging response on the existing Calcutta-Chennai-Bangalore sector.

 Jet Airways starts operations on the Bangkok-Calcutta route from Tuesday. The flight will arrive in Calcutta at 10.20 am and take off at 11.50 am. The airline is offering an inaugural price of Rs 6,500, plus taxes, for a round trip.

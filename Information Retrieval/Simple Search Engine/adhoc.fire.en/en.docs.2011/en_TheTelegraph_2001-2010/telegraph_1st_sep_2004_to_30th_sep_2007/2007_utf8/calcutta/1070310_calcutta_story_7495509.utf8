The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Suit over station hawkers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Friday admitted a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking judicial intervention in the problems faced by lakhs of commuters due to encroachment on railway platforms by hawkers.

 Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Bhattacharya asked the Eastern Railway authorities to file an affidavit stating why it had violated rules by allowing hawkers to operate from the platforms.

 According to Section 144 of Railways Act, 1889, the authorities cannot allow encroachment on any part of the platforms for plying trades without a licence.

 The railways have allowed hundreds of hawkers on the platforms of stations in Calcutta and its suburbs, said advocate Anjan Bhattacharya, who moved the PIL. 

 The petitioner, who argued the case himself, stated: At least six million people come to Calcutta from the suburbs every day to earn a living. They are harassed daily due to encroachment on platforms.

 The lawyer alleged: The railway authorities do not evict the hawkers as they are protected by the leaders of the major political parties.

 Bhattacharya said passenger organisations had requested the railways several times to take action against the hawkers, but to no avail. So, I seek the courts intervention in the matter. Many other daily commuters have shown eagerness to join the case and support my stand, said the lawyer.

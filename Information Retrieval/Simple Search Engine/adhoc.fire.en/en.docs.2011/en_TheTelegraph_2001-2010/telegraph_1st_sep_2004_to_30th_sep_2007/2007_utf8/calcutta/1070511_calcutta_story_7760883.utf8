 Techie car in Bypass crash

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four employees of a BPO in Salt Lakes Sector V were injured when the car they were travelling in collided with a truck at the crossing of the EM Bypass connector, near Park Circus Bridge No. 4, and Huges Road early on Thursday.

 The incident took place around 2.40 am, when the car took a right turn at Parama Island and was headed towards the bridge. The driver and the four employees had a close shave, said Pradip Chattopadhayay, deputy commissioners of police (headquarters).

 Preliminary investigation revealed that the four were working for a private bank and were on their way home after a night shift at office. They have been identified as Saikat Debnath, 20, Shweta Sharma, 21, Darshana Shah, 22, and Nabamita Das, 24. Saikat was seated next to driver Mohammed Selim, 24.

 Nabamita, a resident of Prince Ghulam Mohammed Shah Road, and Saikat, of Thakurpukur, were admitted to a private hospital on the Bypass.

 This is the second accident in the past one-and-a-half months involving employees of Sector V companies. 

 On March 8, Debasish Sau, an employee of an IT company, died after being knocked down by a car ferrying employees of another company near the entry to Sector V from the Salt Lake end.

 Thursdays mishap has prompted the city police to take a hard look at night traffic, particularly vehicles speeding down in various directions from Sector V.

 A senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters said a team will soon visit the spot to ascertain whether any steps need to be taken in terms of traffic engineering to avert such collisions at night, when vehicles tend to move at a high speed down the Bypass.

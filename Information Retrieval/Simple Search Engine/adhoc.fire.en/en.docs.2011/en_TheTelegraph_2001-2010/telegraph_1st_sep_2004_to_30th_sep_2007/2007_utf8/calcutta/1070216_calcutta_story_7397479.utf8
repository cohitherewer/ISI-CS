The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Caring and warm, pillar of support

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ashit Luthra

 The murder of Ravinder Kaur Luthra, wife of past captain of Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) Ashit Luthra, has stunned the citys golfing fraternity. 

 We are shocked and stupefied. How can such a warm and caring person like Ravi meet with such a dreadful end? All of Calcutta knows them and she was a pillar of support to Ashit in his endeavour to turn the club around, said Satbinder Singh, golf convener, RCGC, and a close friend of the Luthras.

 An extremely popular couple on the club circuit, the Luthras represented RCGC at the 250th anniversary celebrations of the Royal amp; Ancient (R amp;A), St Andrews in Scotland, the worlds oldest golf club, in 2004.

 She was also actively involved in the planning of the 175th anniversary programme of RCGC, the second oldest golf club after R amp;A.

 While Ashit Luthra travels extensively around the country to attend to his security and logistics management business, Ravi was more content being at home and lavishing her attention on close friends.

 Their two sons are also keen golfers. While the elder, Kabir, lives with his wife in Bangalore, Angad works and studies in the UK.

 This loss can never be repaired. Ravi was an extremely sensitive lady, always willing to help others. She lit up every party she went to. She also chipped in with her knowledge on interiors when the club needed any renovation, both at the main clubhouse, and the Maidan tent, observed M.M. Singh, CEO of the golf club.

 Vivek Jairath, a member of RCGC, agreed with Singh that Ravi Luthra will be missed by them all. If Ashit succeeded in tiding over the critical period when the club was forced to shut down following labour trouble, it was because of her support. Ravi stood by him and the club in those troubled times and we cannot forget that ever, he said.

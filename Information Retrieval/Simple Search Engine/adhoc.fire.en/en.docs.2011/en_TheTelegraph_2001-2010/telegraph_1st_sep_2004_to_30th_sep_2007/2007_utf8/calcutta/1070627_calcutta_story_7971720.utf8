The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All about glitters and shines 

 - Lack of awareness, need for trained hands

 jewellery created by students of Indian Institute

 of Jewellery 

 By 2007, the gem and jewellery industry is set to surpass a target of $ 16 billion (as compared to $1.5 billion in 2003). 

 But that hardly means the goldsmiths of Bowbazar are getting richer. Or reaching out to more people. 

 For only three per cent of the worlds jewellery is produced in our country, so what if 90 per cent of the worlds diamonds come from here. 

 We need more trained hands, points out director of Indian Institute of Jewellery Renu Kapoor during a visit to Calcutta to explore sites to open a branch of the Mumbai-based facility here. 

 One major reason for the increased demand, according to Kapoor, is the shift in perception of jewellery. It is no longer an investment that you buy and store in a bank. It is now an accessory, says Kapoor.

 This has also spawned demand in a variety of materials of which to make ornaments of. We are even teaching our students to set artificial diamonds in rosewood, says Kapoor. 

 Bidri work, papier mache, terracotta, beads etc are in favour as well. Kapoor feels India is in a position to be a global leader in jewellery designing. We have the finest craftsmen. But since they all learn on the job, there is no fixed method to what they do. That is what a curriculum comes in. 

 To bring about a marriage of the traditional and the trendy, the institute organised a workshop where traditional karigars came to teach students the intricacies of lac artistry. 

 More such workshops are planned. The other problem that needs to be corrected is lack of awareness about global trends. 

 Diamonds are among our top foreign exchange earners. But to make diamond jewellery, we need more contemporary styles, more attention to quality and increased professionalism. Meeting delivery schedules, for instance, is sacrosanct, Kapoor points out.

 Among the 1,000-odd students at the institute, affiliated to The California Institute of Jewelry Training, the majority are becoming technocrats. 

 It helps if you know the craft you are trading in. If educated people do not turn to the profession all these years, it is because it pays less and therefore produces low self-worth, she points out. 

 Thankfully, our students are coming from a variety backgrounds. While many are from families with jewellery businesses, some are bankers daughters or doctors sons. The industry is hungry for trained people. We are encouraging them to set up their own businesses. 

 Even a housewife, can set up a jewellery boutique with a 80-sq ft studio and a lakhs investment. If Bollywood can make it in the global market, why not Bowbazar? signs off Kapoor.

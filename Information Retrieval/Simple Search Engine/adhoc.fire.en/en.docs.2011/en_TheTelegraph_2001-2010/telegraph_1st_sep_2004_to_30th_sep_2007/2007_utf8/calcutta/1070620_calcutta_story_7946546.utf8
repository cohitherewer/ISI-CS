 IFA lakhs missing

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The treasurer of Indian Football Association (IFA), K.D. Pal, allegedly played a key role in the embezzlement of its funds, police have found while probing a fire at the organisations headquarters on March 14. 

 Pal, who was arrested by detective department sleuths on Monday, could have been involved in the withdrawal of over Rs 10.5 lakh from the Super Soccer account of the association. 

 The investigators also found that several cheques, bearing signatures of Pal and IFA secretary Subrata Dutta, were used to withdraw money from a nationalised bank that was not accounted for. 

 We have not found supporting vouchers for many of the withdrawals. We had given time to the treasurer to explain how the missing Rs 10.5 lakh was spent. Pal could account for only about Rs 7 lakh. And he could not produce vouchers, said Gyanwant Singh, the city detective chief.

 Between October 2006 and January 2007, 32-odd cheques had been used to withdraw nearly Rs 36 lakh from the bank account. 

 In most of the cheques, there was a gap to the left of the figure written in words and numbers. This space was used to increase the amount, said Singh.

 The auditors have claimed that they used to get just 15 days to complete a job that usually takes around three months. 

 There was a system of monthly audits but it doesnt seem that these audits ever took place, said an officer.

 According to the cops, the fire was deliberately started in one corner of the record room to burn a large chunk of the accounts-related documents.

 The forensic report has revealed that the material used to start the fire is highly combustible and evaporates quickly. As a result, the fire was short-lived but intense and damaged a bulk of documents related to accounts. It was definitely a planned act, added Singh.

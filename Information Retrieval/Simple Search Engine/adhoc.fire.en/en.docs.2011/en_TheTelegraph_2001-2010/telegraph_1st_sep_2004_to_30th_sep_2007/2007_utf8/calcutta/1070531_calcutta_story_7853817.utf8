 Township in tax dilemma 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Salt Lakes civic authorities are clueless about how to continue providing services to residents without collecting property tax.

 Civic officials and members of the chairmans council met on Wednesday to find a way out, but failed.

 We have no idea how we can provide the services, said civic chief executive officer Tapas Chowdhury.

 Chairman Biswajiban Majumdar said the present cash reserves could sustain the civic services for a maximum of two months. If property tax collection does not resume immediately, the services have to be discontinued after that.

 The municipality stopped collecting property tax following a Supreme Court order nullifying an act that had empowered the Central Valuation Board to assess tax in municipal areas. The order was passed on a petition filed by Bidhannagar Welfare Association.

 Basab Aich, association secretary, said: We never said that the township residents are not willing to pay the tax. We only want the evaluation process to be transparent.

 The chairman said the municipality can no longer collect the tax according to old rates, as it will result in huge losses.

 Opposition leaders are up in arms against the authorities for the decision to curtail civic amenities on the pretext of a lack of funds.

 The Left Front board is not keen to increase the income of the municipality. It had spent more than it had earned and this has resulted in the crisis, leader of the Opposition Debashish Jana (Trinamul Congress) said.

 Some councillors, however, suggested that the municipality collect pending tax from various government departments to tide over the crisis. The state electricity board alone owes the civic body Rs 5 crore by way of service tax, said a councillor.

 Protest over JEE centres

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Over 110,000 students took the state Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) on Sunday, amid complaints of irregularity. This was the first time the examination was held on a single day.

 Some candidates wrote their examination in their schools. It is clear that they enjoyed some advantage, complained the father of an examinee. Students of some elite city schools got preferential treatment, he added. 

 The authorities admitted that some candidates sat for the examination in their schools, but they denied charges of foul play. 

 The examination centres are divided into four zones north, south, east and west. In the application form, the candidates were asked to mention their preferred zone, the authorities said.

 Since the name of the examination centre was not mentioned in the form, there are no chances of foul play, said member-secretary of the JEE board Ashim Bose.

 The examination was held at 199 centres across Bengal and 28 more centres outside.

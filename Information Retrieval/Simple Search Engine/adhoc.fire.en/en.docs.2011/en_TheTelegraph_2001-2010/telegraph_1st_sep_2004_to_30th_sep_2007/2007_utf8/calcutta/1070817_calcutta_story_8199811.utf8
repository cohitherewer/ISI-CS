 A house at New Raipur, in Jadavpur, was looted on Wednesday while the owner, Aruna Roy, 80, was away. No one has been arrested even after 24 hours.

 The house is located in the constituency of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 The burglars decamped with around Rs 2 lakh in cash and jewellery, along with other valuables.

 The owner, a retired central government employee, has lived in her single-storeyed house with her maid ever since her husband died. She has three daughters who are married and mostly live abroad.

 I was in my daughter Polly Ghoshs house in a nearby estate. My maid, Bhabani Naskar, would go to my house and clean it daily, while Polly and her husband stayed there at night.

 On Wednesday night, as the couple opened the main door, they found the bedroom door was shut and the lights were on. On entering the bedroom, they found the steel almirah was broken open and ransacked. The same had happened in the other bedroom, said Aruna.

 They immediately informed Aruna, who came over with her younger daughter Mili Basu Roy, who lives nearby.

 Mili said that apart from cash and jewellery, the burglars had also taken away some valuables purchased abroad. Whenever we go abroad, we bring back gifts for our mother. When she visited us recently, she brought gifts for her grandchildren here, most of which were kept in the locker, she said.

 Police interrogated Bhabani. We think the burglary is the handiwork of some people who are aware of Arunas daily schedule. We have interrogated some people. We hope to arrest the culprits and recover the items soon, said D.P. Singh, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas.

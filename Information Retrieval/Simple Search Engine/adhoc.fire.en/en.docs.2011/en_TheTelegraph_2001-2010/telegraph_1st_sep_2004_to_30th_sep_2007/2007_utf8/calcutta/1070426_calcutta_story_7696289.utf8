 The civic body is planning to shift the sweepers quarters in Korabardan Lane, near New Market, to Judges Court Road. A five-storeyed building will come up for the purpose.

 The move will free about five bigha of prime land at the junction of Fenwick Bazar Street and Market Street, in the north-east corner of New Market. 

 The land can be offered as a carrot to private builders who have proposed to reconstruct the market in a joint venture with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 The five-bigha plot will yield at least 150,000 sq ft of saleable floor space. At the current rate, its value will be more than Rs 75 crore.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: The families of the sweepers are living in a wretched condition. We are planning to shift them to a five-storeyed building on Judges Court Road. 

 The labour quarters was declared unsafe about 15 years ago, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Wednesday.

 Former councillor of the area Provakar Mondol has been pressuring the civic body to make alternative arrangements for the sweepers.

 According to chief engineer (project and development) Nilangshu Bose, about 150 families stay in the quarters. Their relocation will cost about Rs 50 lakh.

 The CMC has also decided to add a floor to the old complex of New Market. The addition of a floor will generate over 300,000 sq ft of saleable space, said a civic engineer.

 The civic brass, however, are focussed on the reconstruction of the market. The work will be done following the European model of heritage preservation, said the mayor. In a number of East European countries, the faades of decrepit heritage structures have been rebuilt, he claimed.

 The project will cost about Rs 50 crore.

 Dense fog disrupted flight and train schedules for the second consecutive morning on Monday.

 Flights could not operate from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport from 4 am to 9.30 am, while several long-distance and local trains on both Howrah and Sealdah divisions were delayed by hours.

 Fog will continue to play foul in the next two days, the Alipore Met office warned on Monday. Acting deputy director-general (meteorology) B.K. Mondal said an anti-cyclonic circulation (clockwise movement of air) over the Bengal-Orissa coast was sucking in moisture from the Bay, leading to fog and a rise in temperature.

 Airport officials said visibility dipped to 50 m around 4 am, as the runway was engulfed in thick fog. Not one morning flight could take off or land. Visibility improved later in the day and an Indian flight for Port Blair was the first to take off at 9.40 am.

 The first flight to arrive was of Jet Airways from Delhi, at 9.45 am.

 Indians Bangalore-Calcutta flight, scheduled to arrive at 7.30 am, landed at 10.10 am. The morning disruption forced Air Sahara to merge two of its Delhi-bound flights.

 An Air Sahara flight from Mumbai tried to land at 3.30 am on Sunday, but failed and was diverted to Hyderabad. A Haj flight of Air-India, from Jeddah, had to be diverted to Nagpur. Both landed in Calcutta later in the day.

 A Jet Airways flight for Mumbai (9W202) was scheduled to take off at 6.05 am, but could finally leave at 11.15 am. It could not take off till 10.30 because of fog, after which some passengers insisted on getting off as their days schedule had gone haywire. The flight left after four or five passengers got off.

 Among the long-distance trains that arrived late are the Amritsar-Howrah Mail (five hours), Kalka-Howrah Mail (four hours), Mumbai-Mail, via Allahabad (three hours) and the Jodhpur Express (two hours).

 Police expressed fear that the fog could cause a rise in the number of road accidents. An officer in the traffic department said the number of road mishaps reaches its peak from mid-January to early February because of fog-induced low visibility.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim said 35 to 40 people are crushed to death under wheels between January and February. In a bid to curb road deaths in the early hours, we have issued a guideline for motorists and pedestrians, he said.

 Officers in the traffic department asked people to be extra-cautious while driving. We are requesting motorists to keep their headlights on in the fog. Besides, while crossing an intersection, they should blow the horn repeatedly, an officer said. If a vehicle is parked on the roadside in the early hours, the tail lights and indicators should be kept on.

 Deputy commissioner Shamim asked pedestrians, especially morning-walkers, to take care while taking a stroll down a street or crossing an intersection.

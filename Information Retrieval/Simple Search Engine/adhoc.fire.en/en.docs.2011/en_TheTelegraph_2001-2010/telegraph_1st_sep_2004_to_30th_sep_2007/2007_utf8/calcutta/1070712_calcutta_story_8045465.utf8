 Colleges get girls hostels

 - UGC-funded scheme to arrest drop-out rate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Eight colleges in the city, including St Xaviers, Lady Brabourne and Scottish Church, will set up new girls hostels within two years with funds from the University Grants Commission (UGC). Under the scheme, 26 more colleges in the state will also set up hostels for girl students by early 2009. A sum of Rs 80 crore has been earmarked for the construction of girls hostels in the state, said a UGC official. 

 The scheme intends to check the drop-out rate among girl students who have moved from their home town to study in a college of their choice, said Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of Calcutta University and a member of the UGCs executive committee. 

 In Bengal, meritorious girls from various parts of the state aspire to pursue higher education in colleges in Calcutta. There are many students who are forced to live here alone, paying an exorbitant price. Unable to cope with the expenses, some of them drop out, added Das. 

 According to him, the new hostels will ensure that girl students dont have to face accommodation problems and will promote women empowerment, which is one of the objectives of the UGC in taking up this special scheme.

 The hostels that will come up will have modern facilities. 

 Our hostel will be set up in a four-storeyed building. It will have rooms to accommodate guests, a meeting room, conference hall and a telecommunication network, said D. Kundu, the bursar of Scottish Church College.

 The UGC has already sanctioned between Rs 75 lakh and Rs 2 crore to the 34 colleges, depending on the proposals submitted by them. The colleges have received nearly half the money. The UGC has set March 31, 2009, as the deadline for the colleges to complete the construction of the all the hostels.

 Apart from Lady Brabourne and Scottish Church, the other colleges under Calcutta University availing of the grant are Howrah Girls College, Maheshtala College, Netaji Nagar College for Women, Raidighi College and Deshbandhu College for Girls.

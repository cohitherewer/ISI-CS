 Gaps in Posta claim

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Investigators on Monday claimed to have solved the murder case of Uttam Chaurasia, the businessman killed near Posta Bazar, but doubts linger over the cop claim.

 Two days after Chaurasia was shot dead, police have arrived at the conclusion that Narayan Mandal, who was arrested on Sunday night, committed the crime with an intention of robbing Chaurasia. 

 Narayan, who was convicted in a dacoity case in the mid-90s, was wandering around Ratan Sarkar Garden Lane, the site of the crime, around 10pm on Friday. Chaurasia was not the specific target but, unfortunately, happened to be present at that moment, said Ajay Ranade, the deputy commissioner of police (central).

 Elaborating on Narayans act, Ranade said: Narayan was suffering from an infection in his fingers that needed immediate attention. He was in a lot of discomfort. But, he did not have the money for treatment and so, wanted to rob someone and pay for his medicines.

 Ranade added: Chaurasia was accosted by Narayan and asked to hand over his belongings. When the businessman refused, Narayan shot him and fled the scene. 

 But the claim does not seem plausible, as apart from one of the three mobile phones belonging to the victim, nothing was missing from his possession.

 Investigators also failed to explain why Narayan fled without Chaurasias wallet containing Rs 5,500 and why he stole only one handset.

 The police are also investigating whether the victims money-lending business or some other dispute had triggered the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Student welfare officer, at last

 Calcutta University will soon appoint an officer whose job will be to look into problems faced by the students.

 The officer in charge of placement will handle the responsibility for six months, after which a permanent appointment will be made, said Shyamapada Pal, member of the universitys syndicate.

 The decision to have a dedicated officer for managing student welfare activities was approved by the syndicate on Tuesday.

 The move, long overdue, will help students a lot, said Pal. The officer will be responsible for tackling problems faced by students daily on all seven campuses.

 The university never had a dedicated students welfare officer in its 150-year-old history, though the institutes statute has a provision for such a post.

 Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University have long been having deans looking after students affairs.

 We are happy that the university has finally appointed an officer whom we can approach with our problems. The authorities should now ensure that the students of all the campuses benefit from the appointment, said Akaash Biswas, president of the SFIs Calcutta University local committee.

 From a minor problem like non-availability of drinking water to organising campus placement, we have to run from pillar to post in search of the right person to lodge our complaint with. We hope the situation will change with this appointment, said Biswas.

 The appointment of a non-teacher to the post, however, has created resentment among a section of teachers.

 The teachers, quoting appointment rules, state that only a teacher who has worked in the university can function as a students welfare officer.

 Both in Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University, they pointed out, only teachers are appointed to the post of dean (students affairs).

 The teachers are also aggrieved with the authorities for not consulting them before taking the decision. 

 Vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee has made the appointment exercising his special powers, said Biplab Chakraborty, general secretary of the Calcutta University Teachers Association.

 Chakraborty and some other teachers had raised the issue at Tuesdays syndicate meeting.

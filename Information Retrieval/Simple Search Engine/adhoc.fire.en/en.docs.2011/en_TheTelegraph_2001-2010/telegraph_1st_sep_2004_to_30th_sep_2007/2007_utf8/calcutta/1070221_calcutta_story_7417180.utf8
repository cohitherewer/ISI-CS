The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Builders, beliefs amp; trends

 SUBHRO SAHA

 City Centre, Salt Lake is a destination design milestone 

 Architecture to create humane cities and environment. A design language to thrive in constraints. The cool quotient and hip factor in an iconic retail store. Flexi space in hospitals to accommodate upgrade. Shadows to celebrate the presence of light

 12 on 12 Kolkata Konversations, an effort to replicate the novel 12 on 12 Ahmedabad series, where architects and designers from across the country congregate to share their ideas, concerns and beliefs, saw a series of presentations creating a collage of contemporary trends.

 The forum, organised by Riverbank Holdings doing the integrated Batanagar township development, sought to cover the entire spectrum of developmental processes from urban planning to urban design, landscape and architecture to interiors.

 The presenting architects came from New Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai and even Dhaka, with the audience a blend of stakeholders architects, planners, designers and government officials.

 There is a need for us to take a hard look at the kind of urban spaces we want for our country. Our developments must be able to address the immediate as well as future needs of the communities they are built to serve, explained Sumit Dabriwala, managing director, Riverbank Holdings.

 The event sought to highlight the fact that design firms generally approach work with a certain philosophy in mind, based on a conviction that drives the design process, which, in turn, determines the final product.

 City architect J.P. Agrawal, the man behind Forum, Technopolis and Silver Spring, echoed Dabriwalas views. A forum like this gives us an opportunity to look at what other people are doing in other cities. There could be an interesting exchange of ideas, he said.

 Not everybody agreed with the format, though. Where was the conversation? Platforms like this can become meaningful only if theres dialogue with the local fraternity, involving government agencies, failing which, its just a stage to advertise your work, observed Unmesh Kirtikar, architect and joint-secretary of think-tank agency Centre for Built Environment.

 This was more like a product launch, concurred Partha Ranjan Das, another city-based architect and urban designer, who is anchoring the riverfront and Dalhousie Square rejuvenation projects.

 Dabriwala disagreed: The idea behind 12 on 12 was to share ideas and processes that go into designing various kinds of spaces. The presentations were meant to leave behind food for thought, not advertise a product.

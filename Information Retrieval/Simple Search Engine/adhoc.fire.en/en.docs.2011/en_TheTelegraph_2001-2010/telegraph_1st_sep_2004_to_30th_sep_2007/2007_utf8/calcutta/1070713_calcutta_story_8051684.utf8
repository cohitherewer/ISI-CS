The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Exam hit by date muddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Many students of Calcutta University missed their political science Paper I examination BA Part I (general) on Thursday, as they were allegedly misinformed about the date.

 The examinees were under the impression that they were to write the test on July 14.

 Following demonstrations by students in front of their colleges, the university authorities announced in the evening that those who could not write the test on Thursday will be given the opportunity to appear for it on July 14.

 The date was revised and the colleges were informed about it much in advance. The colleges were asked to see to it that their students were informed of the changed date, said Onkarsadhan Adhikari, the controller of examinations of the university.

 In the original examination schedule released in May, the political science Paper I examination of BA Part I (general), under the 1+1+1 system, was to be held on July 12, said a university official.

 But because of high enrolment of students and lack of examination venues, the university decided to stagger the exam over two days.

 On June 14, the authorities issued a circular to the colleges announcing that the test would be held on July 12 and July 14. The circular had specified who would appear for the test on which date, said an official.

 It appears that some colleges have failed to convey the revised schedule to their students. As a result, some of the students whose test was scheduled for today thought they would have to write it on July 14, the official added. 

 We did not know that we were to take the test today. The callousness of the university and our college are to blame, said an examinee from Bangabasi College.

 We will ensure that not a single student is affected by the communication gap, said Adhikari.

 The heat of political turmoil in neighbouring Bangladesh has reached the city.

 Thousands of Bangladeshis currently in Calcutta are in two minds about whether to leave for their homeland or stay put till normalcy is restored.

 There have been numerous instances of violence in Bangladesh in the past few days. With emergency being clamped, the situation may worsen. Though buses are still available to Bangladesh, we are not sure whether we should make the return journey now, said a worried Mamun Hussain, who came to the city on a shopping trip last week.

 Tour and travel operators are also hesitating about operating buses to and from Bangladesh. A representative of Shohagh Paribahan (Calcutta), which operates buses to Dhaka, said: There are general strikes in Bangladesh on January 14 and January 15. As a precaution, we are not issuing tickets for these two days. 

 On Thursday, Bangladeshs President Iajuddin Ahmed declared an emergency in the country and stepped down as head of the caretaker government. The development has thrown haywire the itinerary of the Bangladeshis who have travelled beyond the borders. 

 Numerous tourists from Bangladesh visit Calcutta every year for shopping or treatment. Many of them put up in hotels and guest houses on Free School Street and Zakaria Street.

 There has been a steep drop in the number of passengers coming to Calcutta from Bangladesh due to the uncertain political situation.

 This condition will prevail till the elections are held. Very few people are coming to Calcutta from Bangladesh. We might have to cut down on the number of buses running between Calcutta and Dhaka, said Abani Kumar Ghosh of Shyamoli Yatri Paribahan, on Marquis Street.

 That will be bad news for people like Mohammad Abul Hassan, who is on a city jaunt with his nine members of his family. We came to the city from Delhi on Friday and we were supposed to return to Dhaka on Sunday. But our tour operator is not issuing tickets for that day. We do not know how long we will have to stay in Calcutta, said Hassan.

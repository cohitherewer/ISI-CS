 Palm trees to line Dhakuria stretch

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

Calcutta, till the other day, had a Palm Avenue now renamed Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay Sarani and still has a Palm Place, but what it lacks is a road or boulevard lined with palm trees.

 The civic authorities have taken up a scheme to make up for the loss. Initially, three sites have been chosen for planting palm trees: the SC Mullick Road stretch between Sukanta Setu and Dhakuria bridge, the banks of the canals meandering through the city and Chittaranjan Avenue.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will spend around Rs 25 lakh in the first phase of the project. The trees to be planted will not be less than seven feet in height.

 Explaining the reason for choosing palm for the green drive, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said: The tree does not grow wildly and hence, there is no risk of causing obstruction to motorists or drivers.

 On Chittaranjan Avenue, the CMC plans to replace the guard rails on the boulevard with rows of palm trees. A civic engineer pointed out that unlike the guard rails, palm trees do not require any recurring expenditure for upkeep.

 I have already spoken to deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim on the proposal to replace the Chittaranjan Avenue guard rails with palm trees. He has asked me to submit details of the scheme, said civic deputy chief engineer Soumitra Bhattacharya.

 Sources in the CMC said most of the afforestation drives undertaken earlier were failures just because the wrong trees had been chosen.

 No thought was given to the height of the trees. Some of them grew so tall that street lights and traffic signals got blocked, said a senior official.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said Calcuttas green cover is nine per cent of the total area, against the national standard of 15 per cent. In 1963, the green cover was 5.7 per cent. It means merely 3.3 per cent of the area has been brought under the green cover in the past 40 years, he added.

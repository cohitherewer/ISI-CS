 Court axe for rail judge

 OUR BUREAU

 The high court has suspended the railway magistrate whose altercation with a train driver had resulted in the cancellation of 49 pairs of local trains, stranding five lakh passengers at Sealdah station for more than five hours on May 5.

 On Friday, a six-member administrative committee, headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar, took the decision to suspend Mintu Mallick, a first-class magistrate of Sealdah court. 

 The committee asked the registrar (vigilance and protocol) of the high court to conduct a detailed inquiry into the incident on May 5, and asked the authorities concerned to appoint a magistrate in Mallicks place with immediate effect.

 The government railway police and the divisional railway manager of Sealdah conducted separate inquiries into the incident and sent their reports to the administrative committee.

 A separate letter, informing the court about the days incident with statements, was sent earlier to the chief justice and the registrar-general of the high court, said Somnath Mukherjee, assistant general manager of Eastern Railway. 

 The trouble had started when Mallick tried to board the drivers cabin of a train from Budge Budge at Lake Gardens on the morning of May 5, to avoid the rush hour crowd. 

 An Eastern Railway official said Mallick lost his temper when the driver asked him for his credentials. The driver was well within his rights to question his credentials, the official pointed out.

 After the train reached Sealdah, Mallick ordered railway police to bring the driver and the guard to his court. 

 As news spread that two of their colleagues had been detained on flimsy charges, train drivers and guards of Sealdah division stopped work, which resulted in passenger harassment and scuffles between the railway police and commuters.

 Last year, the same committee had suspended a judge of the city civil court for allegedly living in with a woman after giving false assurances of marriage.

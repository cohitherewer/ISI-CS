 What: 

 Launch of Sunita Kumars book Blessed Teresa of 

 Kolkata.

 Where: Oxford Bookstore, Park Street.

 When: Monday, 6.30 pm.

 Take a look: One of Mother Teresas closest followers, Sunita Kumar launched the second edition of Blessed Teresa of Kolkata, her tribute to Mother. 

 The book was launched by Sunitas friends Sharmila Tagore and Russi Mody, who defied the Monday bandh to be present at the gathering.

 Italian Consul General Agostino Pinna was also present at the gathering, apart from many of Mothers followers and friends who shared their personal experiences with all those present.

 In her updated volume of the pictorial biography, Sunita, who had been associated with Mother Teresa since 1965, explores the human rather than the saintly side that many are unfamiliar with.

 It was when Mother passed away that I had the feeling that I must write a book on her. In my book I wanted to show Mother not just as a saint who would sit at the chapel and pray, but many of her other facets including her great sense of humour, said Sunita.

 The book comprises a collection of candid shots of Mother by photographers from the world over. The pictures are accompanied by detailed descriptions and excerpts written by Sunita, including two additional chapters on the process of beatification and the beatification ceremony at which Sunita was present. 

 Mother was like a child, very light-natured and had a great love for animals... I have written in detail about the entire process of beatification and moments during the ceremony when her picture was unveiled and nuns did aarti as children dressed in colours of our national flag sang along. There were many such moving moments that Im sure everyone would like to know more about, she added.

 Sunita, who has had her paintings on Mother Teresa exhibited in London and New York along with M.F. Husains, has included two of those and several other paintings on Mother done by her. Some were seen and signed by Mother.

 Sunita went on to share some of her experiences of having travelled around the world with Mother Teresa.

 The proceeds from the sale of the coffee table book, priced at Rs 895 and published by Om Books International, will go to the Missionaries of Charity. 

 Voiceover: It is always an honour and privilege to be associated with anything that carries Mothers name. Reading the first book was a humbling experience. The clarity, incisiveness and honesty in Sunitas writing on Mother really touches you and Im glad that she decided to come out with a second edition for people to rediscover and be inspired by Mother, said Sharmila Tagore, who came down from Delhi for the launch.

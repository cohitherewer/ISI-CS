 Sutapa and Jayanta Bag together had killed their nine-year-old daughter Tiyasa, forensic tests have confirmed. 

 The woman, the only surviving member of the family, will face charges of murder.

 The tests have also revealed that the injuries on the couples bodies were self-inflicted. 

 Armed with the forensic report, the criminal investigation department (CID) on Monday ruled out the theory that an outsider had attacked Jayanta and Tiyasa before attempting to kill Sutapa.

 There was no outsider in the Bag house at the time of the incident. It is clear that Tiyasa was murdered first. The husband and wife then slit their wrists. Jayanta, a quack, succumbed to his injuries but Sutapa survived. Her injuries were self-inflicted, stated Niraj Narayan Pandey, deputy inspector-general of the CID.

 On April 3, neighbours and police found Tiyasa lying on the floor of the Bags Andul residence with the veins of her hands and legs slit. Jayanta was groaning in pain with his wrists slit. Sutapa was lying beside them with injuries on her wrists and throat.

 Pandey said: We are examining Jayantas cellphone. He had used the phone to secretly record the abortion of a local girl named Pinki Oraon in his chamber. The girls lover, who is also from the locality, found out about the recording and beat up Jayanta in front of the neighbours. It seems Jayanta and Sutapa could not bear the humiliation.

 Bhupinder Singh, additional director-general (CID), said: Jayanta and Sutapa had jointly written a suicide note. She wrote that she had killed Tiyasa before attempting suicide. There is enough evidence to prove Sutapa was a party to the childs murder. 

 According to the detectives, there is no evidence to suggest that the family was involved in a pornography racket. The pornographic photographs we found in the Bag residence were private in nature. The photographs have no link with the case, said Pandey.

 The cars never left the shed but fuel was issued for them every day. Some of the vehicles had been condemned years ago, but the keepers of the law kept the fuel flowing for them.

 A section of officers at Calcutta Polices wireless office on Ripon Street has been involved in selling fuel meant for police cars to outsiders for at least six months. The fuel was issued for vehicles that either remained parked or had been declared condemned and dumped.

 Ten litres of diesel or petrol are allotted daily to police vehicles assigned on duty.

 According to officer-in-charge of the motor transport section of Calcutta Police S.K. Chowdhury, the misappropriation came to light last month. It seems this has been going on for some time. Some of the vehicles had been kept parked at the car shed, but fuel was issued to them every day, he told Metro on Friday. An inquiry has been ordered to find out who were involved in the scam, he added. 

 We are going through the records to find out for how long the malpractice had been going on, said another officer. 

 Some of the vehicles were taken out for only two hours of duty, but the fuel allotted to each of them for the day remained constant at 10 litres. The unused fuel was sold off, he added.

 As part of its modernisation drive, the city police force bought 100 cars, including Boleros, Gypsies and Tata Sumos, over the past couple of years. Currently, there are around 60 Commander jeeps, 50 Gypsies, 30 Boleros and 10 Tata Sumos at the wireless office.

 Ours is the largest petrol pump, catering to 65 per cent of Calcutta Police vehiclesdaily. The other pumps are at Lalbazar and Bodyguard Lines in Alipore, said an officer. A large number of the existing vehicles, especially Commander jeeps, were declared condemned over the past two years. 

 Earlier, we had over 100 jeeps. Now, almost half of them have been condemned and are lying in the garage, said another officer. 

 A section of officers indulge in selling fuel to outsiders. Stern action will be taken against those involved in the scam, stated a senior IPS officer at Lalbazar.

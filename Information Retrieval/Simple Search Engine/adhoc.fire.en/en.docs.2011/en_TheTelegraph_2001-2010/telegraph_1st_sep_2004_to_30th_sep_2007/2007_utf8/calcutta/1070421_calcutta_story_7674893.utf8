 Ayub Nagar erupted in mob fury on Thursday night, following the murder of 14-year-old Mohammad Rameez Ahmad Shah. Residents ransacked the houses of two of the five accused and destroyed a few country liquor outlets.

 Rameez was buried on Thursday night. A post-burial ritual will be performed on Sunday. The wedding reception of Rameezs uncles, scheduled for Saturday, has been cancelled.

 The truth is yet to sink in. We have cancelled the wedding reception and are, instead, preparing for the post-burial ritual, said Rameezs uncle Mohammad Rashid Ahmad Shah.

 The teenager paid with his life for daring to challenge an armed gang of five that had barged into his house and threatened to destroy the shamiana, set up for the reception, for no apparent reason. He was shot from point-blank range.

 Of the five accused, one has been arrested. I have asked my men to round up the others at the earliest, said D.P. Singh, additional superintendent of police (industrial).

 Residents of Ayub Nagar, near Garden Reach, blamed the spurt in crime to the mushrooming of country liquor outlets and units in the locality. The areas notorious for liquor and satta are Bhanga Khali, Kanchantala and Ayub Nagar Bagdi Para. Despite our repeated pleas, police turn a blind eye to the menace. Rameezs murder was the last straw, prompting us to take the law in our hands, said a resident.

 RAF and a huge police contingent were deployed in the neighbourhood on Thursday night to prevent any untoward incident. On Friday, only a police van could be seen patrolling the area. The forces have been withdrawn as the situation has returned to normal, said an officer of the local Nadial police station. A case has been started against those involved in damaging the two houses, he added.

 Wife of 45 days killed

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The mutilated body of 22-year-old housewife Mangala Karar was found on the premises of a factory in Domjur, Howrah, early on Thursday. 

 Husband Laltu, a resident of Jagachha, has been arrested. Police said the couple had married a month-and-a-half ago.

 The body has been sent for post-mortem. We are questioning the husband, said Niraj Kumar Singh, superintendent of police, Howrah. 

 The head and face of Mangala were smashed with a blunt instrument. There was also a mark on the throat, suggesting she had been strangled with an iron cord, said an investigating officer.

 Mangala had been missing since she left her parents house in Liluah, along with her husband, around 9 pm on Wednesday. Her mother came forward to identify the body.

 The blast at McDonalds was caused by a leak of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), declared Calcutta police on Tuesday. 

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee had earlier said that a rise in pressure inside the air-conditioner ducts of the Park Street restaurant was the most likely cause of Sunday mornings explosion.

 The leak of LPG led to the blast. Forensic experts detected the leak near the main burner. The rise in pressure inside the air-conditioner ducts and the other theories have been ruled out, said a senior officer at Lalbazar on Tuesday.

 Central forensic experts have confirmed the leak in their preliminary report. We will get the details of the leak on Monday, added the officer. 

 Central Forensic Laboratory officials visited the restaurant on Tuesday. They attributed the blast to a leak of LPG gas in their preliminary report.

 The officials are trying to find out whether the gas had started leaking before the employees reached the restaurant. As soon as one of the workers tried to light a burner, the explosion took place, said the officer.

 The police will determine whether negligence led to the leak. We will speak to the injured to find out more. If there is negligence, we will start a case against those responsible for the restaurants maintenance, he added.

 The explosion severely burnt four employees and flung the restaurants shutters across the road, killing 24-year-old pedestrian Aftab Hussain Ansari.

 In a press conference that afternoon, the police chief had ruled out the possibility of sabotage or a terrorist attack. He had said that build-up of pressure in the air-conditioner ducts could have caused the explosion.

 Mukherjee had also said that sewer water might have accumulated in the outlets basement, leading to the formation of methane gas that caused the explosion. 

 On Monday, the fire services department claimed that dust in the air-conditioner ducts could have caused the blast. The department lodged an FIR against the manager and owner of the restaurant for possessing only a provisional no-objection (fire) certificate, despite being in operation since March 9.

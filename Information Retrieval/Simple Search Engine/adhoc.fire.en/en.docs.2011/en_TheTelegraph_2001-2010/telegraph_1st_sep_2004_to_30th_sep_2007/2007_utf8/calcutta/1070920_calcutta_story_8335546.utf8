 Window to the world within

 Open Window is a group whose members belong to the middle generation of Indian artists, and each one of them has had a long international career. They are less attracted to the romantic/manneristic trends in contemporary art.They have a distinctive range of stylistic and thematic variations in their works. At the same time, their principal concern is with societal realities of their times as most of them are from families who have a background of post-Independence migration from the other Bengal. The essence of life that is embedded in their works seems to stem from their pre-occupation with these realities of a nascent nation. The on-going show features works by Prabhat Basu, Sunil Dey, Tapas Konar, Pradip Rakshit, Samir Aich, Amitava Dhar, Hiran Mitra, Sudeshna Halder, Probir Gupta, Janak Jhankar Narzary, Dipali Bhattacharya, Gopinath Roy and K. Muralidharan (a painting by him appears here). The works are done in mixed media.

 Quest for science 

 Butterflies use nanotechnology to modify the light rays falling on it and generate a beautiful pattern on their wings. The lotus flower uses it to cleanse its leaf surface. Mammals use it to mix protein and water molecules to form milk and geckoes use it to defy the laws of gravity. 

 In an attempt to explain this technology, Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) has mounted yet another interesting exhibition for science lovers. The exhibition that takes place every year will continue till May 20. The exhibition is part of the moving gallery programme where the exhibits travel to major BITM centres.

 Nanotechnology is an upcoming technology today and seems to have the potential to usher in another technological revolution. This exhibition (students

 to make the children aware of it, said BITM director Jayanta Sthanapati.

BITM had carried out a survey on schoolchildren about their interests in nanotechnology. The survey prompted the theme for the moving gallery exhibition, he added. 

 The exhibition comprises 26 panels, of which seven are working models (live models that one can operate according to the instructions provided). The colourful and interactive exhibits and an audio-visual panel make things more comprehensive. A science officer is present to explain the panels to visitors. 

 The exhibits detail the evolution of the technology, its difference from other forms of technology, its applications and the future possibilities of nanotechnology. The gallery is interesting and interactive. The exhibition will help us, as nanotechnology will be opening new career avenues in future, said Abhikshit Roy Choudhury, a Class XII student of Apeejay School, Park Street.

 The Diary

 Land and Guns

 The sky

 cried at the treacherous blasphemy,

 When

 the soil turned thickly vermilion.

 My

 night was high on vodka ,

 and I

 was

 down with the fever of fright.

 My

 guitar wept in despair,

 Every

 teardrop reeking of ammunition.

 Galloping

 troops hovered beneath

 the velvet sky,

 snatching

 dreams, killing hopes

 and burning fates.

 The

 day was as dark

 as the midnight.

 Raise

 your ears, their

 pain still resounds,

 Raise

 your eyes, the

 bullets still

 fly,

 raise

 your voice, before

 you are imprisoned,

 and

 before you die.........

 (dedicated to the people of Nandigram)

 Coach potatoes

 There

 is one more expression waiting to

 be added to the Oxford English Dictionary.

 A coach potato is a man travelling on a train with nothing to do but stare at women, all the while munching away as if famine-stricken. 

 On a recent journey with my friends on the Kalka Mail, I came across many of these coach potatoes. The men carried expensive electronic gadgets. The journey showed me a new posture of sleeping that can only be described as the sight-seeing pose where these coach potatoes put their heads in place of their feet and lie on their stomachs on the upper berth of the train with their heads resting on their crossed hands. 

 Our group was disturbed when we ate or spoke. Comments were even passed when we said nothing at all! To add to our misery, the train was 16 hours late and was stalled at Mughalsarai for more than 12 hours! We were so tensed that we couldnt sleep for more than 36 hours and continued to stare at our luggage. We were almost ready to attack the coach potatoes with pepper spray. Neither of us spoke nor could we laugh. We even had to avoid addressing each other by our names. 

 With so much being talked about female liberation, this experience made us feel that being a girl was no different from being a commodity, a source of enjoyment for onlookers. Nothing helped us, not even behaving reticently. In the end, we had to call in the security when the not-so-gentlemen crossed all limits trying to take our pictures with their camera phones! 

 All this would not have happened had there been a separate coach for female students. Also, if the authorities would have been a little cautious about letting three people to share the same seat as was done by those in our coach. 

 Sleeping on the floor inside the train should also be forbidden to avoid unwanted crowds. Is this too much to ask from the railway authorities?

 Quota trouble

 The long-lasting turmoil

 regarding quota reservations in the central educational

 institutions proved futile as the Supreme Court

 has gone against the OBC quota formulation. The

 Supreme Court has passed the right verdict. 

 The quota system reduces the scope of receiving quality education for meritorious students, giving undeserved students undue privilege. The government is trying to bring into force the OBC quota system only for gaining a stronghold during elections as a large number of voters belongs to the other backward classes, regardless of the countrys progress. 

 Supreme Court should also have given a solution to the current years quota victims. Losing one academic year is a heavy price to pay for the sake of the governments whims. Those who have received calls from institutions like Indian Institute of Management are about to lose a golden opportunity. Proper judgment is needed to resolve the problem so that the intended purpose, that of allowing those from underprivileged backgrounds an entry into institutes of higher education is rightly served.

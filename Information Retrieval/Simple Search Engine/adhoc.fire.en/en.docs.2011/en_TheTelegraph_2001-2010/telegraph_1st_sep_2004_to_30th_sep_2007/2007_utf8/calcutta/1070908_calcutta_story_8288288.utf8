 JU threat to part ways with JEE

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Jadavpur University, stung by the medical entrance scam, has threatened to sever ties with the state joint entrance examination (JEE) system.

 But before it carries out its threat, the university wants to give the state government a chance by submitting a list of proposals to overhaul the faulty system, which it wants the JEE board to accept in full.

 The university, rated one of the countrys best five by the University Grants Commission, feels it cannot maintain a high academic standard if it keeps admitting students to the engineering courses through the JEE.

 The procedure followed by the JEE board to hold the test and prepare the merit list is faulty, said an official. He blamed the system for the medical entrance scam, which saw undeserving students gaining entry to MBBS courses through dummy candidates who took the test.

 The revamp proposals the university is considering include making the question pattern more scientific. There are also a few suggestions on the evaluation system.

 We may decide to remain under the state JEE board if the government and the board accept all our proposals, the official said. But if the government or the board rejects our suggestions, the university, being an autonomous entity, will be within its rights to follow its own admission procedure.

 Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the universitys executive council, confirmed that a meeting will be held before Durga puja to decide on the ideal procedure to admit students to the engineering courses.

 If the university adopts a separate admission test, the options it is likely to consider are the All India Engineering Entrance Examinations (AIEEE) and the IIT-JEE.

 Members of the universitys engineering faculty met on Thursday to discuss the matter. They were also opposed to the JEE boards decision to prepare a separate merit list for the B.Pharm course, comprising students ranking low on the JEE list.

 Some of the students who qualified for the B.Pharm course this year had ranked below 40,000. The authorities said students with such low ranks had never been given a berth in any course of the university.

 Medical entrance topper in Bihar Biswajit Sawarna has been arrested for allegedly appearing as a dummy candidate for a Malda student in the West Bengal JEE.

 Admission to medical and engineering colleges in 2008 will be by the JEE, the government has announced. However, there will be changes in the exam system,

 The case of the moustache man

 - Airline appeal on snip circular and forced retirement up for hearing

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Indians flight purser Victor Joynath De (picture on right, taken in 2002) is no more in service but his right to sport a handlebar moustache at work is still under the high court scanner. The hearing of the airlines appeal against a trial bench ruling in favour of De will end on Monday. 

 The purser was first grounded and then forced to retire at age 58 on January 11, 2001 two years before his scheduled retirement after he refused to trim his moustache. The man from Salt Lake moved court against the injustice.

 In August 2002, the trial bench ruled that De could keep his moustache and flying gear. Justice Aloke Chakraborty had directed Indian to reinstate him immediately. The trial judge, however, did not say whether De must resume service as a purser. The airline moved an appeal against the order before the high court division bench. 

 Des troubles with Indian began with a circular on July 10, 1998, that stated: Hair should be neat and tidy and flight personnel should be clean-shaven (except Sikhs), with neatly trimmed moustaches not beyond the upper lip. This was an extension of an earlier notification that simply said: Moustache, if worn, will be neatly trimmed. 

 De, who sports a big moustache, refused to accept the snip circular. The rules regarding dress and deportment were acceptable but my client refused to compromise on the issue of his beloved moustache, explained Des advocate.

 The trial bench had observed that the rule framed by the airline with regard to moustache and long hair had not been included in its original operations manual. With regard to moustaches, the respondents (Indian airline) were not having the power to make prescription merely by circular without making a provision in the operations manual, the trial judge ruled. The petitioner (De) not complying with the said requirements regarding moustaches could not be grounds enough for exercising the power to effect compulsory retirement, he added. 

 The Indian lawyers submitted before the division bench that the trial court judgment was improper, as every airline has a dress code of its own. The company can take action against any employee who does not adhere to the code, they told the court. 

 De and Indian officials refused comment on the grounds that the matter is sub judice.

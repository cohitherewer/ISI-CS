The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Of body and no body

 Sasha Waltz and Guests returned to Calcutta with noBody, performing at Rabindra Sadan, the same hall where they had staged Allee der kosmonauten eight years ago. Only this time Sasha was equipped to take on the handicaps the hall presented. So the backscreen and some of the wings were removed, extra sound boxes and lights installed, digital sound and light boards added and the stage surface entirely covered.

 In terms of depth the stage is okay, not unlike the spaces where we usually perform this piece, only there is too little space at the sides. But we are working on it and it shouldnt look too bad, Sasha told Metro during a rehearsal run-through the day before noBody was performed at the Bharat Rangmahotsav inauguration (picture above by Pabitra Das).

 The glass walls set-up at the back reflecting the audience and actors by turn, the huge air-filled balloon that rolled and bounced across the space not only added dimensions to the performance of the skilled contemporary dancers but showed what was possible even at Rabindra Sadan.

 Sashas noBody was the perfect opening to a festival hosted by the National School of Drama and Paschim Banga Natya Akademi that explores the possibilities of dance theatre through plays spread over nine days.

 We dont call it dance theatre. Its best not to think in those rigid terms, I dont care what I use in order to express myself. We do contemporary dance and there is a lot of theatre in the movements, but there is a lot of visual element that brings it close to painting, sculpture, architecture... Again in my next work I am combining dance and choir, making an ensemble of voice and body I will continue to use whichever element is appropriate in putting forth a concept, stressed Sasha.

 The multidisciplinary performance noBody is the last in a trilogy that started with Korper or Body (all about the material, the physical, the human anatomy) and S (on sexuality and origin of life). 

 The name noBody, written as it is, underlines the double meaning of no body and nobody. 

 It is ironically an attempt to use a very physical form to depict the non-physical and spiritual. It is about the soul, that which we cannot touch physically, that which is left after goodbyes are said, the memories that live on after death. When we were conceiving this, 9/11 happened and a lot of our feelings went into this, said Sasha.

 What does the white balloon stand for or the many references to clothing, dressing and undressing? It is never wise to try and interpret everything, people will draw their own conclusions. The balloon is our way of presenting the concept of nothing. Inside the balloon is an emptiness, there is air to which we have given boundaries. The clothes elaborate the concept of the body as the souls garment, but it is also the soul which is shredded to bits or can be given away when someone dies, or out of love. Clothes are also shells into which we can retreat, explained Sasha.

 The dancer trained in Wigman School has come a long way from her early very narrative work on social and environmental issues. 

 For Sasha, noBody is at the other pole to Body if that is black, this is white. I used a lot of props in my two early trilogies and Body was an attempt to check the excess. In noBody the approach is minimal and simple.

 Sasha Waltz and Guests, with its home theatre Schaubuhne an Lehniner Platz, Berlin, tours across the globe with a permanent cast of 10 dancers and 21 associate performers as guests. 

 Though the members hail from different cultural and racial backgrounds Sasha does not believe in using regional dance forms. Instead, she feels, that in the bone structure, the way the muscles work, the way each dancer interprets the concepts, you can feel the rich variations of their individual backgrounds.

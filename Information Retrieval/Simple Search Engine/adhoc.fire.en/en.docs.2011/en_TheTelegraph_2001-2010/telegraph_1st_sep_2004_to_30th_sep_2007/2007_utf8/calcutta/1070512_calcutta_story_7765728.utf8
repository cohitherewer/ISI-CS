 Police and the civic authorities are planning action against Anjan Mitra, who had erected a pandal for his sons wedding by blocking a key road in Salt Lake.

 The pandal stood on one side of a road between AA and AB blocks leading to the busy PNB crossing for three days, from April 7.

 Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), said: We have received a preliminary report that suggests that the pandal had obstructed traffic movement in the area and we would initiate legal action against the offender after a getting a detailed inquiry report.

 The additional superintendent of police, Salt Lake, has been asked to carry out an inquiry into the incident.

 The construction had obstructed a public road and Mitra did not secure a police clearance for that, said Kumar. We are trying to find out how he had managed to obtain permission from the municipality.

 Metro reported on Wednesday last that Mitra, a resident of AB block, had obtained permission for erecting the pandal from the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of the township and the chief executive officer of the municipality against a fee of Rs 5,000.

 Earlier, SDO Tapas Chowdhury had said that he did not give Mitra permission to block the road, as the law does not allow blocking of thoroughfares to host marriage parties.

 Municipality chairman Biswajiban Majumder said: We will impose a heavy penalty on Mitra after checking all documents.

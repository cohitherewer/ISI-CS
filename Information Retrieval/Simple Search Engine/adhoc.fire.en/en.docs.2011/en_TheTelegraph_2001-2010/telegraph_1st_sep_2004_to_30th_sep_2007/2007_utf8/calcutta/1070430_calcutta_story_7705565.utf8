 Towers, a hub in Maniktala 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is considering a plan to construct a modern, multi-storeyed housing estate-cum-commercial hub on 6.5 acres of prime land in Maniktala. 

 The estate complete with shopping mall, a health centre, a cultural centre, an educational point and a playground will also provide rehabilitation to 164 families of CMDA employees, who are presently living in the Maniktala residential estate, the premises proposed for the present hub and complex.

 The existing buildings are in a sorry state and we need to demolish them mindful of the safety of the families who are still living there, and also their rehabilitation, said P.R.Baviskar, chief executive officer of the CMDA.

 The apartment blocks, which came up in 1974, had been initially planned to accommodate those evicted during the construction of the Sealdah flyover. In 1977, all the 387 one-room flats were allotted to CMDA employees at a nominal rate. 

 We hope to begin the construction work in June on a private-public partnership basis, added Baviskar.

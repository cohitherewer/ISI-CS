 The government has made it compulsory for all employees of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital to wear their uniforms and display identity cards to ensure that patients do not get conned by touts.

 All employees of various categories have to wear their uniforms and display identity cards so that patients and their relatives can recognise them, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Friday.

 Dasgupta, who is also chairman of the patients welfare committee of RG Kar, visited the hospital during the day to inspect the infrastructure upgrade work carried out with a Rs 15-crore grant from his department.

 An official said the ministers diktat is primarily aimed at the Group-D employees, most of whom do not abide by the dress code that has been in place for several years.

 The uniforms, he explained, would help patients and their relatives tell a hospital employee from a tout.

 Be it registration at the outdoor clinic or getting a bed in an indoor ward, patients and their families are often conned by touts at government hospitals.

 Dasgupta spent four hours at the hospital, visiting various departments and the kitchen. He expressed satisfaction over the way the kitchen is functioning. Following my instructions, the employees there are wearing gloves and using stainless steel utensils, he said.

 The minister announced that he would conduct surprise checks at the hospital even at night to see whether the employees, including the doctors, are turning up on time.

 The hospital has spent 80 per cent of the Rs 15-crore funds. An 11-gallon-capacity water reservoir has been constructed. The quarters of the resident medical officers are complete and the morgue will start functioning soon.

 Two waiting sheds for relatives of the patients have been set up. The height of the boundary wall will be increased, Dasgupta said.

 SSKM plea to Mishra: Doctors 

 at SSKM Hospital on Friday requested state health minister 

 Surjya Kanta Mishra to upgrade infrastructure in the plastic 

 surgery department so that hair transplant and other advanced 

 surgeries could be performed. We will look into the matter, 

 said Mishra, who visited the hospital to attend a workshop 

 in the plastic surgery department.

 Stamp paper forgery nets man

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man was arrested in Sodepur, on the citys northern fringes, on Friday for his alleged links with a fake stamp paper racket.

 Several fake stamp papers and other documents were seized from Sekhar Maity, alias Apu, said an officer. 

 The items have been sent to the CBI to ascertain whether Maity had links with Abdul Karim Telgi, who is serving a 13-year jail term for running a fake stamp paper racket.

 Maity has been involved in the racket for the past 10 years. He has also duped several people, promising them bank loans, the officer pointed out.

 A preliminary probe has revealed that there are seven other people in the racket, most of whom are residents of Bihar and Assam.

 Originally a resident of Bongoan, in North 24-Parganas, Maity had bought the Sodepur apartment a couple of years ago. His wife still lives in Bongoan.

 The sleuths have come to know that Maity had links with some Bangladeshis involved in a fake currency racket. We are trying to find out whether he, too, was involved in any such racket, said another officer working on the case.

 Police are also looking for a right-hand man of Maity, who owns a printing press. 

 Maity was produced at Bankshal court and remanded in police custody for seven days.

 A fortnight ago, a team from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had arrested two persons and seized from them a large number of fake stamp papers and voters identity cards.

 A detailed probe revealed that they were part of a racket spread across several states and had issued hundreds of fake voters identity cards and fake passports.

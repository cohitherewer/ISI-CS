 Howrah traffic overhaul

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 The traffic management system in Howrah is set for an overhaul a life-saving surgery, as described by police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh, instead of a mere cosmetic one.

 Under the plan, named Integrated Suburban Traffic Project, automatic signals will be installed at busy crossings, more personnel will be inducted in the traffic guards and a hi-tech control room will come up. 

 Singh said the need for an overhaul in traffic management is evident, as the number of road mishaps has doubled over the past five years. On an average, 100,000 vehicles hit the street in the town daily.

 We have submitted a number of proposals to the government for the upgrade of the traffic system. The proposals have been approved and we have been allotted Rs 58 lakh for their implementation, Singh said.

 Initially, he added, 10 automatic signals will be installed in busy areas like Salkia, Bally and Belur. Around 60 km of arterial roads will be brought under the automatic signalling system.

 Police have also proposed to the government to double the number of personnel manning the 14 traffic guards in the district 10 of them in the town from 350 to 700.

 As part of the upgrade programme, the traffic guards will have new buildings, all necessary gadgets like computers and wireless sets, and enough vehicles. These will enable them to keep a closer watch on the areas under their control, said a senior officer.

 The district police collect around Rs 1.5 crore a year as fines from violators of traffic rules. The government has decided to allot us 20 per cent of the amount, or Rs 30 lakh, for improving the traffic system, said Singh. This year, Rs 12 lakh has already been sanctioned. The money will be used to buy various traffic management equipment.

 To solve the parking problem, Singh said his department is planning to set up at least four underground, multi-storeyed parking bays.

 Another 2 deaths on road

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two people were killed, while several others had a close shave, on the city roads on Monday. 

 At 6.25am on Monday, a speeding Matador van knocked down an unidentified 60-year-old man at the Chittaranjan Avenue-Balaram Dey Street intersection. While the vehicle sped away, local youths rushed the man to Medical College and Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. People alleged there was no traffic sergeant present when the accident took place. 

 Almost two hours later, Mohammad Kallu, 55, a resident of Watgunge Street, was killed when an unknown vehicle knocked him down near CISF barracks on Garden Reach Road and sped away. 

 On Sunday, at 11.30pm, 35-year-old Chandan Dey was speeding down NSC Bose Road on his motorcycle when it rammed into a minibus of Naktala-Howrah route at Ranikuthi. The minibus driver, Bapi Dhar, who had stopped the vehicle on his way to his Tollygunge garage to buy cigarettes from a nearby stall, rushed Dey to MR Bangur Hospital. Doctors said he was stable. The driver, however, was arrested for flouting traffic rules.

 We arrested Bapi for not keeping the tail lights on. Had he done that, the accident could have been averted, said the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), Praveen Kumar.

 Buoyed by the unprecedented response from Calcutta consumers, digital giant Sony is expanding its network and unveiling fresh marketing methods.

 Sony India Pvt Ltd, which currently operates four Sony World outlets in the city, is planning to open at least four more hubs of a new digital lifestyle over the next year.

 The market in Calcutta is very dynamic and there is still a potential for exponential growth. This has helped in widening our product base for consumers, offering them entertaining products and lifestyle solutions, Mohit Parashar, general manager (sales and marketing), Sony India Pvt Ltd, tells GoodLife.

 Parashar feels a major trigger for the changing face of retail in India has been the paradigm shift from box selling to value selling.

 Today, every sale is due to the value built around the product, which means more people consider shopping as an experience rather than a necessity. For Sony, our policy is geared towards setting us apart in a cluttered market, he adds.

 An outcome of this differentiation is the companys channel strategy where its brand stores offer a platform for branding and technology, while engaging customers with product benefits under one roof. The stores are classified by consumer profile.

 There are consumers who would like to check out a particular product, the second category is interested in solutions and the third type looks for a lifestyle statement. 

 We have three categories of outlets catering to these three groups with formats like Sony World and Sony Exclusive, Digital Kiosk and Sony Ericsson, Walkman stores, etc, the official explains.

 The company is planning to roll out a multi-pronged programme in Calcutta with brand-building and on-ground activities to get closer to the target audience. 

 This could involve media, product demonstrations, roadshows, exhibitions, direct-marketing initiatives and local-level promos such as gaming competitions and contests.

 Sony is sticking with its personal and experiential product marketing formats to appeal to all five senses of customers.

 Thats how the Sony World and Sony Exclusive formats have emerged. Recent diversification into smaller, interactive formats like the Digital kiosks, Sony Ericsson and Walkman shops are all expansion of our retail strategy, Parashar explains.

 Sony recently linked up with the Bond blockbuster Casino Royale. We will continue to undertake such activities,promises Parashar.

 For Sony standards like Notebooks, MP3 players, PlayStation consoles, cameras and camcorders, the company is focusing on catering to other segments as well, be it through different features, colours or prices.

 The thrust on high-recall brands like Xplod, Sonyhi-fi, Handycam, Cyber-shot, Wega, Vaio, Bravia and Walkman will be strong in Calcutta, too.

 The its a Sony line has a pan-India distribution network comprising over 4,500 dealers and distributors, 170 Sony World and Sony Exclusive outlets and 17 direct branch locations.

 Hunt for Bangla 1300

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Around 1,300 Bangladeshi criminals are holed up in the city and its surrounding areas.

 This came to light after the Bangladeshi government recently conveyed their names to the Indian home ministry, asking it to track them down.

 The list containing the names of 1,293 criminals was forwarded to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Thursday.

 Rajeev Kumar, the deputy inspector-general (operations) of the CID, said: We have just received the list and it will take some time to trace so many gangsters.

 Sleuths suspect most of them have joined hands with local criminals, while some are staying in the city posing as businessmen.

 Earlier, Bangladesh had sent a list of 80 names to the CID. Around 20, including those wanted by Interpol, were arrested in and around the city.

 The CIDs Special Operations Group (SOG) has been asked to trace the Bangladeshi criminals. We have activated all our sources. We are sure quite a few of the criminals have obtained Indian citizenship through fraudulent means, said an SOG officer.

 The places where the criminals are likely to have holed up include Jorasanko, Posta, Jorabagan, Rajabazar, Entally, Regent Park, Baguiati, Rajarhat, Ghutiari Sharif, Barasat, Serampore and Howrah.

 An officer said the criminals will be booked under the Foreigners Act if they are not found to have committed any crime here and pushed back to Bangladesh. We cant hand them over to Dhaka, in the absence of an extradition treaty between the two countries.

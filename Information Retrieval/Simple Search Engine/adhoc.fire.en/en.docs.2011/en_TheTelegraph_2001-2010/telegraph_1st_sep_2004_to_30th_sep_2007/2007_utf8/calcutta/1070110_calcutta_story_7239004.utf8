 Cooking up a Maidan mess

 Todays question: Should Ganga Sagar-bound pilgrims be allowed to camp on the Maidan? More responses will be published next week

 Salkia, Howrah 

 There is a campaign on to save the Maidan. When the high court is pressing not to hold the Book Fair, the biggest cultural event of Calcutta, there, why are pilgrims being allowed to camp there? The citys lungs are being polluted. The ministers should adopt strict measures to save the Maidan. Simultaneously, the state government should make better arrangements for Ganga Sagar-bound pilgrims.

 Well, Ganga Sagar Mela is an annual affair, so we can allow the pilgrims to camp on the Maidan once a year. The area is well-connected and therefore, is the best venue for any camp or even fair. But the government should constitute a body to save and maintain the Maidan, which can take up the responsibility of arranging the camps and cleaning up the Maidan once the event is over. 

 Titas De Sarkar, 

 Lake Town

 The government should make better arrangements for the pilgrims, who gather once in a year. They face a lot of problems like water shortage, poor sanitary facilities and cold weather. The pilgrims litter the Maidan by throwing garbage and excreting in the open. The government should arrange for makeshift toilets and dustbins to prevent pollution.

 Ganga Sagar-bound pilgrims pollute the Maidan. They are not at all disciplined. They litter the ground and also the neighbouring area. Even a month after they have left, you cannot visit the Maidan because of the foul smell. The Maidan is our pride. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should look for an alternative venue on the outskirts of the city. An awareness campaign should be launched to save the Maidan.

 Nidhi Poddar, 

 Address not given

 The Maidan should be saved from any kind of pollution. Whether it is a fair or pilgrims camp, the damage on the greens has far-reaching impact. Any amount of cosmetic cleaning cannot undo the damage. Is the Maidan meant for fairs, camps and meetings? What about the ecological balance of the city?

P.S. Chatterjee,

 Andul, Howrah

 The Maidan has always been used by the political parties. So, once in a while the greens can also be used by the pilgrims. But it should be maintained properly. An organisation should be formed for its proper upkeep.

 The army has again allowed the pilgrims to camp on the Maidan. They cause the highest degree of environmental damage by converting a part of the Maidan into an open latrine. Steps should be taken to avoid polluting the citys already damaged lungs.

Moumita Sengupta,

 Behala

 The Maidan is the traditional venue for holding fairs and political meetings. But we should look into the environmental hazards, too. The pilgrims litter the whole area. Cleaning it up is a hectic job. Therefore, the government should fix an alternative venue for the Ganga Sagar-bound pilgrims. 

 Ashish Bhowmick,

 Kaikhali 

 The pilgrims cause the great damage to the Maidan during the Ganga Sagar camp. The whole area is converted into an urinal and even after a month later, you cannot visit the grounds owing to the unbearable stench of excreta. The government should save the Maidan. Even fairs and political meeting should be kept out of Maidan for sometime. The citys lungs should be kept clean.

 Avishek Ganguly,

 Bally

 Pilgrims camps will increase the pollution on the Maidan manifold. The pilgrims litter the place and with the Book Fair coming up, the Maidan will turn into hell, causing immense environmental damage. There are many unused plots, off the Bypass, where fairs and camps can be held.

 Ranadip Ganguly,

 Diamond Harbour

 The Maidan is generally allocated for Book Fair every year allowing book-lovers to congregate and buy books. It is an ideal site where people from afar can reach Maidan without much ado. But giving the same place to the Ganga Sagar-bound pilgrims to cook and relieve themselves will cause immense pollution.

 Green lobbies are planning to move Calcutta High Court to seek a uniform policy for the upkeep and beautification of the 171 parks in the city.

 The parks are governed by the Town and Country Planning Act, which does not allow any construction on the premises. But the act is followed mostly in breach. We will show the court how constructions are going on in these open spaces, said environment activist Subhas Dutta.

 His organisation, Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity, and a few other groups will move the petition before the green bench of the high court.

 The petition is almost ready and will be moved in a couple of weeks. We will seek a uniform policy for the maintenance and beautification of the parks. We will also ask the court to constitute an expert committee to stop misuse of the parks, added Dutta.

 The 171 parks excluding the Maidan, Subhas Sarobar and Rabindra Sarobar cover 62 lakh sq m. Just as special measures are being taken for the upkeep of the Maidan and Rabindra Sarobar, these parks, too, need specific guidelines for their preservation, Dutta pointed out, explaining why green activists are joining hands to move court on the issue.

 According to an expert committee set up by the state government in 2002, the total open space in the city is less than one per cent. All efforts should be made to preserve this space, said Dutta.

 Former CBI additional director Upen Biswas, who will be a party to the case, said parks with waterbodies on their premises should have a separate maintenance and beautification policy.

 Big trees can fight pollution better. So, a concerted attempt should be made to plant more big trees in the open spaces, said Biswas. He also called for curbs on artificial beautification of the parks, as it harms the ecology.

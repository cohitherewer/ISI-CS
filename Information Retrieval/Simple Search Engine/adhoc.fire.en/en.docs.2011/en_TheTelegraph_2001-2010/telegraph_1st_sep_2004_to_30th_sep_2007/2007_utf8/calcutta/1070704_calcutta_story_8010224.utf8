 Soothing shades of nature

 Nature comes across in its most virgin, pristine elements through the lens of Madhuchhanda Sen. An ardent nature lover, she captures its soft, hushed eloquence in images that leave the viewer awestruck at natures magnificent bounty. In Natures Ensemble, the ongoing exhibition of her photographs, her pictures speak the language of love, faith and harmony. They are like silent actors upon a stage, appealing to the audience not to turn their back on nature, and instead, return to its fold where they rightfully belong. Bright, dazzling, verdant images of varieties of lush, leafy foliage evoke natures innate fecundity, the power that nurtures, nourishes and propagates life. Natures peaceful and gentle aspects are brought forth in photographs depicting tender buds and raw blossoms.

 Innovations in modern art

 Like the numerous twists and turns in the journey of a great river, trends in art also keep changing continuously. Modern art has thus undergone several transformations over the years, evolving with time and assuming new shapes and dimensions. Experiments in Indian art have led to the adaptation of completely fresh, original styles, techniques and modes of presentation. New creative perceptions and passion for aesthetic innovation can be noticed quite vividly in all corners of the country. Art Today: Trends and Talents in Indian Contemporary Art; a Tale of Four Cities offers viewers an essence of the ongoing spontaneous creativity in the contemporary Indian art scene. Featuring works of well-known painters from Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Calcutta, it highlights the common concern of modern artists towards universal social and human problems. Participants: Avijit Dutta, Anil Naik, Chippa Sudhakar, Diptish Ghosh Dostidar, Kiran Chopra, Laxman Aelay (a painting by him appears right), Prasenjit Sengupta, Sunil Lohar and Vinod Goswami.

 Its an innocuous tailors tucked away between CC Saha and a chemists on busy Moti Sil Street. But for a small board jutting out from a jungle of hoardings that proclaims its existence, one would pass it by. But it was frequented by stalwarts once. A specially designed jacket for Uttam Kumar in Roudra Chaya, Topshes twill jacket in Sonar Kella, the various Mughal achkans in Shatranj Ke Khiladi, Goopys patchworked phatua in Hirak Rajar Deshe as also the army generals uniform in Utpal Dutts Baisakhi Megh were all made here.

 What makes Suman Tailors such a pilgrimage is that he catered to two of the citys most celebrated and most nitpicking film-makers. Satyajit Ray drew extensive sketches of costumes in his kheror khata and his tailor simply had to follow it.

 For Ray saab, we didnt have to do much. He drew the costumes for me, marked out every detail and purchased not just the material but also the buttons and every other accessory that went into the costume.

 Even then, says Harun-al-Rashid, the propreitor (and the namesake of Rays hero in Phatikchand), there would be alterations and modifications.

 He recalls how the patchwork for Goopys phatua was restitched several times before Ray would have it. And the karigars would not comprehend why a blue could not go with a brown. But saab was very specific about his colours. 

 Utpal Dutt, on the other hand, came to Sumans and poured over Rashids old catalogues that had extensive details of the British army and navy uniforms and made spontaneous decisions. He would sometimes be exuberant, sometimes quiet, more approachable than Ray saab. My father would often put forth his suggestions which Dutt saab would listen to carefully. 

 Haruns father, the late Abdur Rashid, migrated from Murshidabad and after working as a tailor at various shops, started Suman Tailors in 1961 at Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. Dutt had been led on to Suman by New Studio Supply at Jagubabur Bazar that lent out costumes to Tollywood studios.

 Dhiren Dutt of New Studio referred Dutt saab to my father when he was looking for someone to do his costumes for Kallol, says Harun.

 And it is here that the Rashids excelled. They were, in fact, suppliers of uniforms to British Airways and the then British Overseas Airways Corporation. They understood well the detailings, the kind of buttons to be used, the peak caps, the monograms, says Sova Sen, Dutts wife, for whom Harun still works and provides many of the costumes for their drama organisation PLTs plays. What began with Kallol continued with Barricade, Tiner Talawar and Baishakhi Megh.

 Ray came to him after hearing of him from Dutt. Says Sandip Ray: Suman definitely had expertise and they did a lot of the costumes for Shatranj... Of course, a lot of research went into the costumes. My father collected pictures from Bourne and Shepherd, Victoria Memorial and also travelled to Lucknow and Hyderabad and even to India House in London and took slides of the period costumes. He picked up his materials from small shops in Hyderabad and Lucknow.

 Suman has also catered to other Tollywood stars. The Roudra Chaya jacket became such a hit that Uttam Kumar kept it for himself. Then there was Anil Chatterjee, Gyanesh Mukherjee, Dipankar De and Ranjit Mallick who had not just their costumes but also their personal clothes stitched here.

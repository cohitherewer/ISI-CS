 Stabbed for trying on shoes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 30-year-old man stabbed his cousin for trying on his new shoes in their Collin Street residence on Tuesday. 

 Sheikh Salim, 40, was taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. His cousin Sheikh Suraj stabbed him around 1.30 pm.

 Suraj became angry after he saw Salim putting on his new shoes. An altercation ensued, which led to fisticuffs. Suraj fell down and sustained injuries on his head. In a fit of rage, he picked up a knife lying in the kitchen and stabbed Salim in the chest, said Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

 We are trying to find out if the incident is a fallout of a family dispute, he added. 

 Suraj fled after the incident. Sheikh Qasim, his elder brother, was in the room during the stabbing. He raised an alarm. The neighbours took Salim to hospital, said an officer of Park Street police station.

 A probe revealed that Suraj was a drug peddler and had been arrested several times by Park Street police. Salim, who also had a criminal background, used to stay with the brothers in the rented room. Suraj is a local rowdy. Raids are on to nab him, added the officer. 

 The police have detained Qasim. We suspect that he might be involved in the incident, another officer said.

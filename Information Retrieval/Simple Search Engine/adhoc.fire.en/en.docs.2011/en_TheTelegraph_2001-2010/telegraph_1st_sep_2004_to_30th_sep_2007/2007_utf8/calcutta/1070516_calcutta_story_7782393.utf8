 Metro Briefs

 The crisis at AMRI Hospitals, Salt Lake, deepened on Tuesday, even as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asked government officials to intervene. The hospital authorities have stopped admission of patients and threatened to down shutters in two days if the employee unrest continued. A section of employees, backed by Citu, has been agitating for the past 10 days against the dismissal of an employee and the alleged atrocities by the management in forcing them to work for long hours. The number of patients admitted at the hospital has come down from 105 to 42 in the past few days, as services were hampered due to the agitation. 

 Two men were arrested in the city on Tuesday in connection with separate cases of snatching. Sanjay Sikdar, 22, was held on Karl Marx Sarani for snatching a gold chain from Tania Das, 22, while she travelling on a rick-shaw on Prince Anwar Shah Road. Sanjay, along with two associates, stopped the rickshaw and took away the chain at gunpoint on March 11. The gold chain was recovered from Sanjays possession. In the other case, Sanjoy, alias Tublu, 27, was held for snatching a gold chain at gunpoint from Keya Sinha, a housewife, in Chakraberia Lane, in Ballygunge, on March 11. Sanjoy was sentenced for seven years in a dacoity case and was released six months ago.

 A 30-year-old motorcyclist crashed into a sewage pipe on Prince Anwar Shah Road on Tuesday and died on the spot. Traffic movement was disrupted after the accident.

 Crushed by container

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 32-year-old labourer was killed and another labourer was seriously injured when a portion of a metal container fell on them at Hindustan Petroleums Budge Budge plant on Monday afternoon.

 Abu Taher, working on contract, died immediately, while Biswanath Samanta was taken to hospital. Taher is survived by his wife and two children.

 The broken part of the container, used for mixing grease, fell on the labourers while they were erecting a wall, said an officer of South Port police station. About 100 labourers from the plant demonstrated on the premises, demanding compensation for the bereaved family.

 Deputy commissioner (headquarters) P.K. Chatterjee said: We are investigating the matter.

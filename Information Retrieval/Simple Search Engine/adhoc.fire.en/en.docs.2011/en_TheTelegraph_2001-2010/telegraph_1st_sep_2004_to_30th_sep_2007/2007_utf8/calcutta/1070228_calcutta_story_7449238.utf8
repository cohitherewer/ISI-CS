 Cut-off marks frozen

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University (CU) on Tuesday decided not to increase the minimum marks required in Class XII board examinations to seek admission in its undergraduate courses.

 Like the past few years, students will need to obtain at least 45 per cent in the subject in which they want to do their honours at CU. In addition, they will have to score over 50 per cent marks in aggregate in the four subjects they have scored the most and English.

 If a student has over 55 per cent in the subject in which he/she wants to do honours, then the minimum 50 per cent aggregate score will not be required.

 The existing cut-offs will also stay for the various general stream courses. 

 After considering the views of teachers, students and experts, we decided not to increase the subject-wise and aggregate cut-off for admission to our undergraduate courses, said pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Suranjan Das.

 CU overhauled the student admission process for undergraduate courses this year. 

 The university will no longer deduct a percentage of the marks obtained by Indian School Certificate (ISC) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students.

 An exhibition of rarely seen photographs will be the highlight of Satyajit Rays birth anniversary celebrations in the city. The images, part of a collection of 110 black-and-white photographs by Hirak Sen, will subsequently travel across the country and even to Hanoi. By June, a selection of the photographs will be put up on permanent panels at Priya cinema and Star Theatre.

 A collection of the prints in the form of a book is also being contemplated, said Arijit Dutta of Priya, where the exhibition will be inaugurated on Thursday. Sen has given him exclusive rights for the display.

 The show of 40 photographs will be mounted at Star Theatre after a week. The exhibition will then move to Krishti in Memari, Gitanjali in Bolpur and Vidyasagar Bhavan in Ghuskara, said Dutta. The exhibition in Memari, Bolpur and Ghuskara will be accompanied by screenings of reprocessed versions of Rays Aranyer Dinratri and Pratidwandi.

 We screened the two films and a restored Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne print in Calcutta last year. Now, it is the turn of the districts, said Dutta.

 Another collection of 60-70 photographs by Sen will be mounted at PVR Juhu, in Mumbai, on May 7. Three Ray films, Aranyer Dinratri, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne and Pratidwandi, will also be screened. Sharon Thomas of host Sony Classics wants to make the event a fitting tribute to the genius. Big names from Bollywood are expected to attend the inauguration and speak on Ray. 

 The photographs show Ray at his piano composing music, bent over a typewriter, designing book covers, reading amidst a pile of books, looking through the camera and guiding actors.

 The 30 inch x 40 inch prints were developed with great care at Mitter Bedi Lab in Mumbai, which was Rays favourite, disclosed Dutta.

 Sen has been close to the Ray household for several decades. He first visited the family as a 19-year-old friend of Sandip Ray. After following around Rays film unit for years, Sen was accepted as the official still photographer. From 1980 till Rays death in 1992, Sen was his constant companion. He had photographed Ray as he accepted the Oscar, but those, like many other frames, will remain in his private collection. 

 The exhibition will travel to Pune from Mumbai before reaching Delhi. The show in the Capital is expected to attract VIPs since the Lok Sabha Speaker is chairman of the Ray Society. The collection of prints will then be displayed at Satyam Theatres, Chennai.

 It may be possible for the public to order some of the prints, he added.

 Burglars thrive in times of showers

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Beware of burglars and thieves the city police have issued an alert, with the monsoon having set in.

 The Lalbazar police headquarters has flashed a message to all 48 thanas across the city to step up their vigil during the monsoon, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 The next few months, till October, will be crucial. Our records show that the most burglary and theft cases take place during the wet spell, added Singh.

 The cops will go on extensive night patrolling and the police stations have been asked to check each road, lane and bylane at night during the monsoon, he added.

 Last year, around 15 house burglaries and 20 thefts of cars and two-wheelers were reported between February and May. The count just doubled during the monsoon, pointed out Singh.

 Sleuths have already initiated a drive to prevent monsoon crimes. We have put more than 30 burglars behind bars, he said. 

 Burglars like it when it rains, for the sound of the shower drowns the noise of breaking locks in houses and cars. And it is easy for them to flee, too, as the roads are mostly deserted, said an officer. During summer, breaking into a house is difficult, as people are awake till late at night.

 Well be extra cautious this monsoon. But the people, too, should be careful with their houses and cars, Singh said. He stressed that residents instal security gadgets, like a central locking system, in their vehicles.

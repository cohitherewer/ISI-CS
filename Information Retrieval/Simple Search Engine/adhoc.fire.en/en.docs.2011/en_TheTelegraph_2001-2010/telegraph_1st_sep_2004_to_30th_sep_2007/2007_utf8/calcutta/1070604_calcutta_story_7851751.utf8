 Ceiling strategy for water consumption

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city civic authorities are likely to set a limit to free consumption of filtered water by households.

 Consumption beyond the limit will come under water tax, which has been tentatively fixed at Rs 3 for every thousand litres.

 The limit is likely to vary from 10,000 to 15,000 litres a month, said a civic official who did not want to be named. If a household consumes more than that, it will have to pay at the rate of Rs 3 for every thousand litres of extra water. The rate, however, has not yet been finalised.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has come up with the idea following opposition from most mayoral council members to a suggestion from the economics department of Jadavpur University that water tax be imposed on all domestic consumers.

 We have entrusted the economics department to conduct a survey on what people think about water tax and suggest measures to check wastage of filtered water, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 To prevent wastage, the department has advised that all 2.5 lakh-odd household taps be brought under the metering system.

 The survey has so far been conducted in 10 of the 141 wards in the city. The preliminary report was presented to the mayor and his council members on Wednesday. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and the project director of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Projects were present at the meeting.

 A mayoral council member said the survey has revealed that 72 per cent of middle-class citizens owning a house do not support the idea of water tax.

 The attitude of the lower middle-class households, however, is just the opposite. About 69 per cent of them said they would not mind paying the tax if the civic authorities could ensure adequate supply of filtered water at their doorstep.

 Flat-owners, too, are agreeable to paying the tax, provided they get round-the-clock supply of water.

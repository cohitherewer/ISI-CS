 Skyline shift in trade terrain

 - Burrabazars buildings are rising, mostly flouting law and safety norms, to carve out more space

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Burrabazars skyline is changing.

 Though the citys business hub is cramped for space and hardly a vacant plot can be spotted in the area, there is no missing the new constructions along the dingy lanes of Burrabazar.

 A walk down the congested lanes reveals the promoters strategy scale up vertically, join buildings and create space. With more and more promoters joining the space-creation bandwagon, the statutory norms of construction are being flouted.

 Take the case of three buildings on Jamunalal Bajaj Street, off MG Road. The occupants of these three buildings 35, 37 and 45 Jamunalal Bajaj Street use common entry and exit, as the separate entry and exit points have been sacrificed to create shop space.

 Four years ago, a small portion of a verandah on the first floor of 35 Jamunalal Bajaj Street fell off. But not just was the verandah repaired, a fifth floor was added, provision for a lift made and the main entrance of the building closed, complained Pankaj Jhawar, who has a small office in the adjoining 37 Jamunalal Bajaj Street.

 With the sudden change in the building plan, Suresh Kumar Somani lost his source of livelihood a small garments shop on the mezzanine floor of the once-four-storeyed building that has now become a part of the illegal lift well.

 We had moved court in 2004 and got a favourable order, but my shop was demolished, said Swati Somani, daughter of Suresh.

 And while the Somani family was complaining about loss of business, new occupants moved in, filling the terrace-turned-fifth floor.

 Whatever I have done is for the good of the building, asserted owner Navratan Binani, unfazed about the charges.

 Such disputes between the building-owners and occupants are not rare in Burrabazar, where the supply of space has always lagged behind the demand.

 Barely 500 m from the three buildings is 157 Rabindra Sarani, at the MG Road and Rabindra Sarani crossing, where the dispute is over the number of floors.

 In July 2005, Prahlad Roy Goenka bought it from its previous owner and started some new construction, which the occupants opposed.

 It was a three-storeyed building, but the new owner registered it as a five-storeyed structure and started the construction of two new floors This is illegal and we are opposing it on grounds of safety, said Satyanarayan Jhawar, a tenant. 

 I have done nothing illegal, asserted Roy Goenka.

 The promoter is accused of adding illegal portions to other buildings as well. 

 He is carrying out illegal construction at 161 Rabindra Sarani. Even at 159 Rabindra Sarani, he has done a lot of illegal construction work, said Prem Ostwal, who occupies office space at 159. 

 With the two sides sticking to their stands, the matter has reached the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and also the courtrooms.

 Though the civic body is aware of the developments, it is yet to initiate any action against the violators. 

 In most cases, we get the information of an illegal building after the construction has been completed, said Gorachand Mondal, director-general (building), CMC, refusing to comment on a concrete action plan.

 While the civic body is trying to play it safe, police are trying to steer clear of the disputes. These charges and counter-charges are very common here People keep getting new orders from the court. If we start meddling in these affairs, we will run the risk of contempt of court on a daily basis, said an officer of Burrabazar police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From fire trap, pillar to post

I am one of the 40 tenants at 35, 37 and 45, Jamunalal Bajaj Street, in Burrabazar area. There is a fire waiting to happen here for the last four years due to illegal constructions on the premises.

 There is only one common entrance and exit passage for all the three buildings, where at any time of the day, a minimum of 500 people are present. The illegal construction, which has further narrowed the passage width to hardly four-five feet, has worsened the matter. 

 The construction began four years ago. The residents have approached all authorities Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), fire services, electricity services, Calcutta Police, ministers and officials to take appropriate action against the promoter and the landlord, but without any result.

 The CMC issued a demolition order two years ago (Demolition case no. 94 - D/2004-05; date 8.4.2005). The fire services inspected the premises and issued a letter to the CMC to demolish the illegal structure (No.188/FES/0/C-1/35-5/05; date 21.7.05), but there has been no action despite repeated visits to the municipality.

 The CMC is saying that they have asked for the help of the local police station and the deputy commissioner (central). The local police station is trying to escape by saying its the CMCs responsibility. 

 A Calcutta High Court order (W.P.No.13380 (W) of 2004; date 15.10.04) had said no further construction was to be made on the ground floor. But the construction didnt stop; it was completed recently. 

 The way the building has been wired has created the fire hazard. Though new wiring has been installed recently in one of the buildings, the rest is in extremely poor state. Electrical wires stick out all over the narrow passages.

 The situation is made more hazardous by the fact that most of the businesses carried out from the building are of textiles saris, dresses which are inflammable.

 The vulnerability of the premises increases as the approach road to the building is very narrow and crowded. It may prove difficult for a fire engine to enter in case of an emergency.

 We came to know through your paper that the CMDA has found that fire engines cannot enter many roads in the city. We have come to know that Jamunalal Bajaj Street belongs to this category. This does not only make our premises, but all those on the road, vulnerable. 

 The promoter is using muscle power, money and political connections to prevent any action, while the lives and livelihoods of hundreds (as it is a commercial building) are at peril. We fear official help will only come to us after the disaster happens. Through Metro on Sunday we would like to appeal to all concerned to act before it is too late.

 Metro Briefs

 Eleven-year-old 

 Naved Khan, who went missing from Entally on Saturday afternoon, 

 was brought home on Sunday. The Class IV student, a resident 

 of Beniapukur, was in the custody of Uttarpara police. His 

 family had lodged a missing diary, stating that he had disappeared 

 from his school in Entally. Local residents saw Naved wandering 

 aimlessly in Konnagar on Saturday evening. When they questioned 

 him, the child kept saying that he wanted to go to Ladies 

 Park. The residents handed over the boy to police, said an 

 officer of the police station. Naved told police that he was 

 taken to Konnagar by two armed men. It seems Naved went to 

 Konnagar on his own. We are conducting a probe, stated an 

 officer of Beniapukur police station. 

 Niva 

 Sen, an attendant in a Baguiati nursing home, was arrested 

 on Sunday night after local residents alleged that she was 

 trying to sell a male baby admitted to the clinic. Superintendent 

 of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar said the baby belonged 

 to a vagrant woman. 

 The 

 civic lighting department has decided to instal a traffic 

 signal at the crossing of Picnic Garden Road and Kustia Road. 

 The area has become accident-prone following commissioning 

 of the Bondel Gate flyover, hence the decision, said mayoral 

 council member (lighting) Sushil Sharma. 

 Entry 

 of visitors into the Calcutta airport has been banned from 

 Sunday night due to security reasons. The ban is in view of 

 Republic Day and will be in place till January 28, said officers 

 of the Central Industrial Security Force. 

 The 

 civic authorities have decided to keep their bottled water 

 project in abeyance till all households are brought under 

 the water supply network. The mayor said the project to market 

 treated water has not been scrapped. About 30 per cent of 

 the citys population is not covered by the filtered water 

 supply network.

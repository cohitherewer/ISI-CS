 Calcuttas hospitals are falling behind those in other cities in providing proper services to their patients, said state commerce and industry development minister Nirupam Sen on Thursday. 

 Most of the private hospitals here have advanced treatment facilities and doctors who are highly skilled. In terms of skill and technology, we are on a par with other hospitals in the country and in some cases, even better. But patients are still leaving for other states for treatment, said Sen. 

 When it comes to providing proper services to patients, the citys private medical institutions are failing to attract patients, he pointed out.

 The minister was also critical of the private hospitals practice of highlighting their achievements by releasing data about the number of patients successfully treated and the low death rates recorded.

 But for a family of a patient who has died, these statistics can appear insensitive. This realisation is essential for those in the medical profession, the minister said.

 Sen was attending the inauguration of an advanced dialysis centre and a gastroenterology unit at Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Centre. 

 The dialysis unit has haemo-dialysis facilities. The gastroenterology unit will have facilities for gastroenteroscopy, gastrointestinal endoscopy and other advanced diagnoses. The hospital also has a liver clinic.

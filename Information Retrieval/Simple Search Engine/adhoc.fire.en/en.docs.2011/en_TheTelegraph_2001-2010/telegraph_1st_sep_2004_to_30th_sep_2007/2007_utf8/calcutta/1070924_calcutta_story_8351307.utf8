 M.S. Dhoni: Blue favourites

 From the sleek Sector V office to the plush Park Street food stop and the luxurious confines of a lounge to the bustling Burrabazar betting hub, Calcutta will remain glued to screens big and small as India takes on Pakistan in the final of the Twenty20 World Cup on Monday evening.

 The match starts when most offices give over. We are expecting a full house by 6pm, says Bunty Sethi of lounge Starstruck in Forum, which saw more than 250 people trooping in to see Yuvraj decimate the Aussie bowlers on Saturday night.

 The management of Souravs: The Food Pavilion, on Park Street, expects an equally enthusiastic response: There is more excitement in less time in a Twenty20 match. The footfall will soar to watch the final on the giant screens at Souravs, says a spokesperson. 

 Even the 24x7 industry is ready to take a Twenty20 break. Most IT companies in Sector V are making arrangements so that their employees can catch the match between and after work. The Twenty20 format is just perfect. The game is over in three hours, unlike a 50-over match that can take up an entire day. Several manhours are, thus, saved, says a human resources executive at TCS, where multiple screens have been put up in the cafeteria. The techies will, however, have to take permission from their supervisers to catch the Wanderers clash.

 By virtue of current form and track record, Dhonis boys are the favourite not only among pundits but also Burrabazar bookies. Twenty-four hours before the match, the betting rates were 70 paise for India and Rs 1.25 for Pakistan. This means that someone betting Re 1 on India will get Rs 1.70 if the Men in Blue win, while those staking the same amount on Pakistan can make as much as Rs 2.25 if Shoaib Malik and his men come up trumps.

 Though Pakistan has the reputation of playing well against India, they have always lost to us in the World Cup. So, Indians start as favourites. Yuvraj is the player to watch out for, says a bookie.

 That the subcontinental teams could not even make it to the Super Eight stage of the 50-over World Cup in West Indies in April-May this year has made the occasion more special. A festival comes once in a year, but an India-Pakistan World Cup final happens once in a blue moon, sums up businessman Arpan Roy, who will be cheering Team India at Starstruck.

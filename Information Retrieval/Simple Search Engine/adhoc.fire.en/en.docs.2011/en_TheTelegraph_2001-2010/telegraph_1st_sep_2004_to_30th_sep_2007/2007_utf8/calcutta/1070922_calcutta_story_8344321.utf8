 Essence of emotions

 Rasiya, depicting the nine rasas of life, is framed around the life of Lord Krishna, believed to be the embodiment of the nine human emotions which are necessary for any creative energy to take its course. The act begins with vatsalya ras shown by the love between Yashoda and the infant Krishna.Veer ras or bravery is shown when Krishna jumps into the river to retrieve his ball. The humorous episode of dressing Krishna up as a woman is a depiction of hasya ras. The attraction between man and woman, or sringar ras is shown by the love between Radha and Krishna. Again, the sorrowful plea of Udhav asking Krishna to return to Mathura is an act of karun ras. Krishna displays raudra ras or rage in his battle with Kansa. From here, the scene shifts to The Mahabharata where Draupadi is being undressed in court. Krishna arrives and saves her, much to the surprise of all. The episode shows adbhut ras. Horror or vibhasta ras is represented by the repulsive sight of the dead in Kurukshetras battlefield. The act concludes with shant ras or peace as seen in Meerabais deep devotion for Lord Krishna. Concept, choreography and direction: Sanjay Bhattacharya (picture left).

 Event: Dance drama, Rasiya When: Today at 7 pm Where: Maharashtra Niwas Auditorium, Hazra Road

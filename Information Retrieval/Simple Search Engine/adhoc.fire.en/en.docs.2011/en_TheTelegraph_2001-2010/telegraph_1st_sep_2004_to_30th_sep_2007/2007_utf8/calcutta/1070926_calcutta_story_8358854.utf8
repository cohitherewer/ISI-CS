 Inspired strokes

 Another Life is proof of Nabakishore Chandas fascination with life as he has inherited it. A self-taught artist, he displays amazing mastery over lifes diverse, beautiful forms that inspire him to express himself through art. With little exposure to artistic traditions, his tryst with colours is a spontaneous outpouring of his personal imagination. Embellished with extremely deft strokes, his works feature persistent mythical motifs, while laying equal emphasis on the traditional patas of Bengal. Undoubtedly, the most interesting feature of his works is his use and choice of colours. His paintings articulate a synthesis of multiple languages, mesmerising viewers with the promise of many untold stories and unheard songs. The works on show are done in ink, water-colour and acrylic, both on paper and canvas. One among them, Fabric of Life appears above.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Nabakishore Chanda When: Till September 28; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Samokal Art Gallery, 23 Gariahat Road, 1st floor, Gol Park

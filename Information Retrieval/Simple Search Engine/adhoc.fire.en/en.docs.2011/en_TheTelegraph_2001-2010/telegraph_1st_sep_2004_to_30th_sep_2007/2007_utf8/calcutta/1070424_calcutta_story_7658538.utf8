 - DATABASE OF CASES

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Police stations in Calcutta and the rest of the state are set to become a part of a nationwide computer network.

 The wide area network (WAN) will connect the Union home ministry with police stations across India and the state and police offices in between. The project is called Common Integrated Police Application (CIPA).

 The infrastructure for the project, funded by the central government, is being set up. Arrangements have been made to impart technical training to officers of Calcutta Police.

 The database accessible over the network will contain information on every aspect of policing from case details to court records. Use of paper by the police will be discouraged once the network is in place. This will ensure that FIRs once registered cannot be altered, stated a senior police officer.

 The database will contain information on criminals, gang movements, missing persons and medico-legal cases, added another officer.

 The software for operating the database is being developed by experts from National Informatics Centre with inputs from the police. The National Crime Record Bureau is monitoring the project.

 The pilot project had a successful run in Chandigarh. It was subsequently launched in parts of south India, including Hyderabad, Bangalore and Pondicherry, said a senior police officer.

 Steps have been taken to ward off hacker attacks. If hackers penetrate the network, the system will immediately block access to information. The location of the hacker will be beamed on the screen of the control room and the nearest police station will be alerted, said a technical assistant in the project.

 Additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas, D.P. Singh, confirmed: Work is on at most police stations to set up the infrastructure for CIPA. The project is at a preliminary stage and nothing much can be said about it now.

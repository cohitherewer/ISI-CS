 Diversified symbols

 Symbolism is a recurring feature of all art. Through its figurative associations, it expresses multiple, hidden layers of meaning even in an apparently ordinary visual image. The ongoing show of paintings and sculptures, featuring works by four artists belonging to two generations, posits four different trends of temporal hues through the artists distinctive styles of transforming concepts into symbols. The sculptural images of Tapas Sarkar are iconic. Assimilating folk and tribal traditions with western modernist modes, he reveals the inner conflicts and contradictions of his subjects. Chandan Bhandari absorbs the essence of nature, reflecting its silence and vibrancy at the same time. The symbols of Pinaki Acharya (Time; picture above) are generated through the tension he creates between idea and authenticity. Ashok Kumar Dey (Lord Krishna; picture right) specialises in mythical symbols, transforming them into formal structures of contemporary reality.

 lEvent: An exhibition of paintings and sculptures lWhen: Till March 31; 3 pm - 8 pm lWhere: Good Time Reading amp; Art Shop, 27 Shakespeare Sarani

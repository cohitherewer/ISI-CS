 A celebration of life

 And spectral dance, before the dawn, / A hundred Vicars down the lawn; / Curates, long dust, will come and go/ On lissom, clerical, printless toe; / And oft between the boughsis seen/ The sly shade of a Rural Dean Rupert Brooke.

 From time immemorial dance has been an integral form of basic human expression. Pre-historic cave paintings display men and women dancing in mirth, in a free-spirited expression of joy. Sapphire Creations Dance Workshop presents two creative items: Rituranga and Positive Lives Say Yes to Life.... Rituranga is a celebration of seasons through dance movements. The second item, Positive Lives, is a dance visual montage presentation which tells the story of people living with HIV/AIDS. Through a unique marriage of dance, music and photography, the montage seeks to eliminate stigma and reduction against the victims that prevent them from living with dignity and realising their full potential as citizens of the country.

 Event: Rituranga, a dance presentation, and Positive Lives, a dance-visual montage When: Today at 6 pm Where: EZCC, Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB 201, Salt Lake

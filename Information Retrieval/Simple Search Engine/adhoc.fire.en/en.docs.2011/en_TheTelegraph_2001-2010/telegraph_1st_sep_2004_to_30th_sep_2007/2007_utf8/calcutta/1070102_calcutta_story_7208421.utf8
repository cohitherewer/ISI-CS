 I heard them all say, Cheers to Life... is how Kaushik Chatterjee, the COO of UB, sums up the mood of the last night of 2006.

 GoodLife brings you the mood and the moments.

 What: Royal Challenge presents The Telegraph 31st Nite.

 Take a look: New Years Eve here took a leaf out of the Arabian Nights with bonfires, pretty Shamianas in white and pink and strings of tiny lights dotting the space. A play of gold on white gave a rich and warm feel to the chilly night. A large open-air screen provided a glimpse of the dance floor inside the air-conditioned dance Shamiana with laser lights and ceiling done up with flowing fabrics in pastel shades.

 The bash: Club president Noomi Mehta set the festive tone with a funky cowboy hat. 

 You-cant-go-wrong-with-black ruled the dress code for men while women were more adventurous with reds, blues, pinks and virginal white. Skirts, dresses or tops they all sported asymmetrical cuts. The night was all glitter and glam with even the saris and suits sporting sequins.

 The highlight of the night was definitely celebrity artist Lesl Lewis with his signature hairdo and jazzy red guitar. Carrying forward the mood of celebration, he began the night with a bang. A chain of popular numbers like Dum maro dum and Pari hoon main got the crowd moving to the beats and joining in with him. The party people were absolutely bowled over by Lezz backed by a set of six dancers in red-feather headgear, shaking their hips in synchronisation.

 Add to this the magic of crooner Jyotsna from Mumbai belting out Bollywood favourites like Dhoom. The grand finale saw the duo come together for a jamming session on centre stage. Post-midnight, DJ Firoze took over the console.

 Sip bite: One side of the club grounds was neatly arranged with tables close to the food-and-drink stalls serving up dishes from Gupta Brothers, Red Kitchen and Lounge, Arsalan and even live counters for pizzas and pastas. Free flow of liquor made its way from the bar counters of White Mischief, Kingfisher and Chantilli.

 Voiceover: Close to 2,500 people have brought in the New Year with us. I couldnt have asked for anything better, smiled Deepankar Nandi, CEO, CC amp;FC.What: Royal Challenge presents The Telegraph 31st Nite.

What: Royal Challenge presents The Telegraph 31st Nite.

 Take a look: 9.45 pm. While outside a sizeable crowd waited to get in, the party had already begun inside. The guest-list was varied. From families partying the year out together, to couples and groups of young friends. 

 If the men were mostly in suits or smart jackets, the women offered more variety. From sexy knee-length dresses with asymmetrical hemlines and short skirts teamed with laced-up sandals, to zardosi saris and salwar kurtas and the ubiquitous jeans and tunics. Many preferred to go formal with long coats paired with smart jeans or trousers.

 The bash: The trio of European Dancers ensured that even if the temperature dipped outside, the party zone was scorching from the start. From Hips dont lie to Kaliyon ka chaman, these dancers provided ample eye-candy for the final night of 2006. If their movements were fluid, their performance was punctuated by the more energetic steps of Aby Baby, who took the gathering through a sequence inspired by Casino Royale. 

 By the time singer Roop Jouhrie, of Honey honey fame, took the stage, the audience needed little prodding to take to the dance floor and sing along with her. From her hit track to Helen hits like Piya tu, Yeh mera dil and Aa jane ja, the party was in full blast when she shifted to Crazy kiya re and Pyar tera Dilli ki sardi.

 But it was left to Channel V super singer winner Ravindra Upadhyay to take the crowd on a roller-coaster ride. From the moment he burst on to the stage with Are deewano mujhe pehchano to Chand sifarish and Bheege honth this guy rocked. And it was not just the young things who were kept busy on the dance floor. The not-so-young-couples, mothers dancing with sons, fathers with daughters and entire groups of friends and families shook more than just a leg. We are loving it. We enjoy dancing and theres enough scope for that here, said Sweta and Sanjeev.

 Calcutta is rocking. I simply could not stop singing because they were enjoying so much and that gave me such an immense kick, said Ravindra. What was most touching was their warmth, added Roop.

 Sip bite: There was plenty of finger food, from Samosa to Paneer Finger to Aloo Stuffed Mughlai Toffee. The dinner spread included Butter Nan, Peas Pulao, Dal Makhani, Chicken Zafrani, Palak Paneer, Salad and Papad.

 Voiceover: The footfall was approximately 2,000, the same as last year. The live music went down very well with the guests, said Sanjeev Ghosh, general manager, Space Circle.

What: Royal Challenge presents The Telegraph 31st Nite. 

 Take a look: The fireplaces at the club lawn took care of the chill and the warmth of the party people ensured that the night was a memorable one. The men turned up in their best suits and women donned both Indian and western wear.

 The bash: DJ Sooraj from Mumbai and local band Dhwani took turns to keep the dance floor what it was jam-packed. Many couples started dancing even on the periphery. There is a difference between a night club crowd and the crowd in Saturday Club. If the members like the music they will be on their feet for hours. But if they are not enthused, it is very difficult to bring them to the dance floor, said DJ Sooraj, belting out tracks like Dus bahane, Ya Ali and Kya mujhe pyar hai.

 The voiceover: After a very long time we have had such a rocking bash at the club. What made it better was the way it was organised. The crowd was controlled, the tickets were not oversold and everybody behaved properly. The other highlight of the party was the music, a good mix of Indian and western, said club member Vijay Burman.

What: Royal Challenge presents The Telegraph 31st Nite. 

 Take a look: The fun quotient high, the ambience festive, the mood sober and safe. Once husbands, boyfriends or friends managed to get through the dress code check of tie and jacket/national dress, you walked in through a passage beautifully lit up with tiny bulbs and a red star. 

 On the left was a counter distributing colourful caps. Once at the venue, it was a 1,700-plus crowd, all families and friends. You could sit in the open with fireplaces to keep you warm. The covered enclosures looked great with chandeliers and tables lit with candles.

 Denims, denims and more denims Be it skirts, capris or trousers, the women flaunted denims in all forms. There was little skin show, some even choosing to go the desi way in a lehnga. The just above or below the knee, ruled the dress hemlines.

 The bash: Emcee Barry Brien captured audience attention quite well. Once Mumbai-based Goan band Aqua Flow was on stage, the spirit soared. As the band belted out numbers like Lets rock, Labamba and I will survive, the oldies took the stage first. 

 Seventy-year-old Amiya Ghosh and wife Anita moved from one dance form to the other cha cha cha, rumba The couple from Sweden was accompanied by mother-daughter duos and some other couples as well. We love the New Years Eve at Tolly. For the past 10 years we try and make it to the club during this time, smiled Amiya.

 DJ Austin kept the dance floor busy with numbers like Part time lover and Its my life. As the music progressed, the floor grew hotter. Dance till you drop was the motto. 

 Some girls chose to get rid of their high heels to groove better. Erik and Winnie Eriksen from Denmark along with their two sons were visibly excited. 

 The second day of their five-week stay was hot and happening. And why not? This is a New Year celebration we will remember. The party is great, the music awesome and the people really warm, said Erik. Prizes were given away for Best Dancing Couple, Best Elegant Couple and more. 

 Sip Bite: The food corner included Paneer Balls, Vegetable Chop, Cocktail Samosa, Fish Croquette and Chicken Lollipop.

 Voiceover: We had a steady number of people throughout. The feedback has been encouraging, smiled Arunava Chakravarty, deputy managing member, Tolly.

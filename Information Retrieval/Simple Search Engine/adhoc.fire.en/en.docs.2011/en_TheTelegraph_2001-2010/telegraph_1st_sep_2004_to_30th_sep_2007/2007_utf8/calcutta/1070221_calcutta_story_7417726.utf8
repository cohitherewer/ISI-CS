 A traffic sergeant of a special wing of Calcutta Police that keeps an eye on reckless driving on city streets flouted a one-way rule on his motorcycle, slammed into an elderly pedestrian from behind and then sped away without lending a helping hand.

 The tale of the bad cop came to light a week after the hit-and-run left the senior citizen nursing a broken leg and with his faith in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees people-friendly police force bruised.

 Last Tuesday, Adhir Kumar Mandal was waiting to cross Strand Road, around 5.45 pm. I was heading for Armenian Ghat to avail of the ferry service to Howrah station, the former employee of Coal India told Metro.

 The stretch was one-way and vehicles were moving north to south. I checked to find no south-bound traffic nearby, before stepping off the pavement. But as soon as I stepped on to the road, something hit me from behind and felled me, recounted the man in his 60s.

 Just before he lost consciousness, Mandal caught a glimpse of what had knocked him down a red motorcycle with the acronym for Calcutta Police emblazoned atop its number plate.

 I remember seeing the back of a sergeant in uniform speeding away... The motorcycle had obviously come from the opposite end, violating the one-way rule, but the sergeant did not even stop after hitting me, complained Mandal.

 Two constables on duty who did not dare haul up the sergeant later came to his aid and arranged for a taxi, in which some bystanders rushed him to Medical College and Hospital.

 Mandal suffered multiple fractures in his femur bone and was confined to the hospital bed till Sunday. He then lodged a complaint with the office of the deputy commissioner of police, traffic department, at Lalbazar police headquarters, before leaving for his Burdwan residence.

 Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), promised an inquiry and said: If the sergeant is found guilty, lawful action will be initiated against him.

 Mandals son Atanu, a fin- al-year student of engineering in Nagpur, expressed shock at the act following the accident. An accident may take place anywhere, but the sergeant should have stopped and helped my father, instead of fleeing, he said.

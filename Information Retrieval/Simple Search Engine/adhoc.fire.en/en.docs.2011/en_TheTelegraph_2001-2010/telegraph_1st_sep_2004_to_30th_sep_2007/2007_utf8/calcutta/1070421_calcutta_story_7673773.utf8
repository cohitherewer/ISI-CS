 The proposed parking plaza under Laldighi, at BBD Bag, has cleared its final hurdle, having received a nod from the state finance department earlier this week. The government is likely to issue the work order to state-run Mackintosh Burn by the end of this month.

 The finance department cleared the project on Monday. Now, we will issue the work order, said PWD chief engineer Swapan Kumar Das. The project cost, pegged at Rs 27 crore, will be borne by the state.

 We will start the project as soon as we get the letter from the government, said Mackintosh Burn managing director Nilmani Dhar. Pre-construction work will take around two months, after which work on the plaza will start.

 The two tiers of the plaza spread across more than 22,000 sq m will accommodate 300 cars each. The central part of the upper tier will be reserved for VVIP cars.

 There will be two rest rooms for drivers on each tier. The initial plan to set up a canteen has been dropped, considering sewage problems. 

 The PWD also plans to set up a rooftop garden with ornamental plants and Australian grass. Purification of the Laldighi water is part of the scheme.

 PWD officials will soon sit with police to chalk out an alternative traffic movement plan in the BBD Bag area during the period of construction. Till the plaza is commissioned, cars are likely to be parked in front of Writers Buildings and the stock exchange building.

 Pre-construction work will start in a couple of days, with the temporary relocation of six statues off Laldighi. As many as 94 trees will have to be felled. We will plant 500 saplings to make up for the loss to the environment, said PWD chief engineer Das.

 Work is on to shift the tram tracks. The relaid tracks will circle Telephone Bhavan, instead of Laldighi.

Munna Patel, a 20-year-old cleaner of a truck, died of burns sustained at the Kona truck terminal, Howrah, on Wednesday.

 A preliminary investigation suggests suicide, though police have not ruled out foul play. The driver of the truck whom Munna assisted has been detained.

 According to an officer of Jagacha police station, the security guards of the terminal smelt something burning at one corner around 10pm on Wednesday and rushed to find Munna half-charred. They took him to Howrah District Hospital, where he died. 

 I was on patrol duty on National Highway 6 when I was informed about the incident. When we reached the spot, the cleaner had already been taken to hospital, said the officer.

 On interrogating the driver, the police found out that Munna, who hailed from Andhra Pradesh, was suffering from depression ever since he had been accused of being involved in a murder.

 According to him, Munna collected petrol from the trucks tank, poured it over himself and set himself on fire.

 The other drivers at the terminal fled after the incident.

 Niraj Singh, the superintendent of police (Howrah), said: A preliminary probe suggests Munna had committed suicide. A hunt is on for the drivers who fled the scene.

 Trouble broke out at Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) on Sunday, after the hospital authorities refused to release the body of a patient whose relatives would not clear the bill. 

 According to sources, Nanno Dhanuk,70, was admitted to CMRI with jaundice and severe respiratory problems on May 25. Nannos son, Kamal Babu Dhanuk is a Group D employee at BM Birla Heart Research Centre, which is also run by the same business group. 

 According to hospital rules, employees are entitled to reimbursement for treatment and stay in the hospital. But they have to pay for the medicine and other expenses.

 Sources said that Nannos medicine bills ran up to Rs 82,000. After his death on Saturday, Kamal Babu told the hospital that he could not pay such a big amount. The hospital refused to release the body. So, we lodged a complaint with Alipore police station, said a member of Nannos family.

 On Sunday, members of the Congress-affiliated CMRI-BM Birla Heart Research Centre Employees Union staged a demonstration, demanding immediate release of the body. 

 Later in the day, the body was released, after Kamal Babu signed an undertaking declaring that the authorities would deduct Rs 100 every month from his salary to repay the bill.

 The medicine expenses should be borne by the patients family. Our employees agreement clearly states that clause, said Rupak Barua, chief operating officer of CMRI.

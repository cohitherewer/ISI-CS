 Lake Gardens flyover has claimed its first victim a young motorcyclist. Around 7.20 am on Wednesday, Somnath Ghatak died of head injuries suffered in a fall as his motorcycle skidded on the four-lane flyover.

 Officers of the Tollygunge traffic guard said Ghatak, in his early 20s, was speeding along when he lost control of his motorcycle and smashed into a guard rail. He died in a private hospital nearby.

 The first fatality on the two-year-old flyover has put some technical flaws under the scanner. Experts pointed to a deviation from the original plan and the flouting of a norm that made the descent sharper than it should be.

 The morning mishap on the flyover was the first among four fatal accidents on the city streets on Wednesday. Two of these were caused by the common bane of buses on similar routes racing recklessly. And all this in the middle of a road safety week being observed by traffic police.

 Around 8.10 am, 40-year-old Bhabani Banerjee was run over near Mahajati Sadan, on Chittaranjan Avenue, while getting off the private bus she had taken to get to office from Dum Dum. Police said the employee of Burrabazar post office was getting off the bus on route 214A, when the driver suddenly accelerated. She fell to the ground and was crushed by the rear wheels of the vehicle. She was taken to Medical College and Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries. 

 After the accident, a mob pelted stones at another bus on the same route. Witnesses claimed the two buses were racing, said an officer of Jorasanko police station.

 Deaths: 8

About two hours later, Bijoy Kumar Purushottam, a middle-aged resident of 121 Chittaranjan Avenue, died after being hit by a private bus at the intersection of Mahatma Gandhi Road and Syed Sally Lane. Witnesses said Purushottam had got down from a bus and was crossing the road when he was hit from behind by another bus. He died on the spot.

 The two buses were racing and Purushottam got trapped in the middle, said a traffic sergeant of Jorabagan traffic guard.

 Unless the commission system for drivers is scrapped, such accidents will be difficult to avoid. We have already written to the government and now a policy has to be in place, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 Late on Wednesday, 41-year-old Shyamal Gayen, on a self-operated wheelchair, was run over by a private bus at the crossing of Jessore Road and SK Deb Road, in the Lake Town police station area. Police said local residents put up a roadblock for more than one hour after the accident.

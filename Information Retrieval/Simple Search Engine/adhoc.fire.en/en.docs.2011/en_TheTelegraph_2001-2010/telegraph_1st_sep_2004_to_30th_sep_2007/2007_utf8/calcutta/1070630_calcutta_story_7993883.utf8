 Appeal against review

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education on Friday appealed against a court order asking it to set up a committee to reassess the answer scripts of a student who had failed in HS 2007 but cracked the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).

 The council rules do not allow reassessment of answer scripts. Two years ago, on a plea by a student for reassessment of scripts, the Supreme Court had observed that we could follow our own rules in the matter, the council stated in its petition to the division bench of Justice P.K. Roy and Justice T.K. Giri.

 According to the councils rules, a review involves retotalling of marks and checking whether any answer had been left unmarked.

 The appeal, against the order of Justice B. Somadder of the same court, will be heard on July 3.

 Debapriya Sengupta, a student of Laban Hrad Vidyapith, in Salt Lake, had ranked 1,700 in JEE but failed in four science subjects in HS. She moved the high court, seeking re-examination of her answer scripts.

 On Wednesday, Justice Somadder accepted Debapriyas plea and issued the order on reassessment.

 More than 20 similar cases are pending in Justice Somadders court. 

 On Friday, he adjourned the hearing of the cases till July 6 because of the councils review petition.

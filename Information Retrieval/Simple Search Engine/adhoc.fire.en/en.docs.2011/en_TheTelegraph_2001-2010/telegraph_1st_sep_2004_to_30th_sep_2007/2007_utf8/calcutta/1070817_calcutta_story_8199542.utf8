 The Pratibha Patil effect has travelled from Rashtrapati Bhavan to Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC).

 Three weeks after India got its first woman President in 60 years, RCGC on Thursday got its first woman committee member in 175 years.

 It was just a few days after Pratibha Patil was elected President that I was told about my nomination and it immediately struck a chord, smiles 57-year-old Anu Bindra. I was quite taken aback when I received the call to join the 12-member balloting committee, but I agreed immediately.

 With a fair record on the fairways for 25 years, Bindra feels her new-found status will be a big boost to women golfers and will encourage more women to take up the sport. From captaining the Indian teams to Australia (2006) and Thailand (2005) to being the non-playing captain for the Asian Games in Doha (2006), from being chairperson of Indian Golf Union Ladies Section to captaining the Calcutta Ladies Golf Club on the Maidan, she is a real golf veteran.

 Bindra, now a die-hard fan of Tiger Woods, owed her first tee-off to her husband, (late) GS Bindra. When I used to attend golf parties, I used to hear people talk about birdies and I asked my husband what it meant. Thats when he suggested that I play. He passed away in 2004 and now I feel like Im living an extension of his life, she says.

 Her immediate goal? Encouraging junior golfing for girls in Bengal. Her long-term goal? To raise the standard of ladies golfing in eastern India.

 Anu Bindras nomination speaks volumes about recognising the ladies fraternity in the chauvinistic world of golf. Even three decades ago, women were restricted to the Shamiana at RCGC. This is quite a first for the oldest sporting club outside the British Isles, said M.M. Singh, the CEO of Royal.

 So, are the winds of change creeping into the male world of club management in Calcutta? Renu Roy, who was elected vice-president of Saturday Club in September 2006, sure feels so: Women today are playing a prominent leadership role in so many spheres. This development at RCGC is an exceptionally good sign for city clubs.

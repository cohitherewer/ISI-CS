 Check on ailing hearts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A minor chest pain, discomfort or dizziness which is often ignored can prove fatal.

 Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (Sads) is a ticking time bomb for those with genetic cardiac disorders.

 Nigel M. Wheeldon, a consultant cardiologist at South Yorkshire Cardio-Thoracic Centre, Sheffield (UK), and a group of doctors launched a campaign Flight for Hearts to spread awareness about Sads 10 days sago in the UK.

 After travelling through France, Greece and China, the campaign hit the city on Wednesday.

 The condition afflicts young adults and children with no prior cardiac problems but with a genetic trait of the same, said Wheeldon.

 It happens when the heart fails to function as a pump. The fast and erratic rhythm of the heart leads to a collapse in blood circulation, causing death in a few minutes, Wheeldon explained. 

 Instant cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can save the patient. Besides, doctors prescribe implanting intra-cardiac defibrillators (ICD), an equipment that restores the normal heart rhythm, to fight off Sads. The equipment is expensive and the campaign aims to raise funds for those who cannot afford it.

 Shock or stress, loud noise, diving in pools or exercising may result in Sads. An individual suffering from frequent blackouts due to cardiac rhythm disorder is 10 times more likely to have Sads, he said. Rabin Chakraborty, a cardiologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, is involved in the campaign.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Centre to referee in cable squabble

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 The Centre may have to intervene for the second time since April in a dispute between multi-system operators (MSOs) and broadcasters.

 In a letter to the nodal officer of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the authorities of Kolkata Cable and Broadband Pariseva have alleged that Zee Turner and Sony have not provided the MSO decoders to beam their bouquet of channels. 

 Broadcasters are bound to provide decoders to all MSOs registered with the Union information and broadcasting ministry. Without the gadget, the encrypted signals of pay channels cannot be decoded and aired. Kolkata Cable and Broadband Pariseva was recently made an MSO. Cablecomm, another MSO, has been sharing the Zee and Sony feed with it.

 Over the past 20 months, we have requested the broadcasters several times to provide us decoders. We have even staged demonstrations at their offices, but they have not paid heed to us. The broadcasters have asked for a deposit of Rs 4 crore, said Mrinal Chatterjee of Kolkata Cable and Broadband Pariseva.

 The MSO had moved court as well. The issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible because the second phase of the conditional access system roll-out will commence soon. The letter is an effort to hasten the process, added Chatterjee.

 Sony city head Rajib Mukherjee, said he is not in a position to comment since the matter is sub judice. Jayanta Das of Zee Turner was not available for comment. 

 TRAI nodal officer Abhijit Sanyal said he had received the letter and would forward it to the Union ministry.

 In April, Shristi, another new MSO, had written to the state information and cultural affairs secretary, alleging that Zee was not allowing it to beam channels to favour its own MSO, Siti Cable, and sought the Centres intervention. The matter has not been resolved.

 Disc doors shut on partying cops 

 - Bosses frown on policemen in plainclothes flashing ID cards to have a ball

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Wheres the party tonight?

 Certainly not at the disc down the road if youre a sub-inspector or assistant sub-inspector out to have some fun.

 The nights of policemen in plainclothes mostly jeans and T-shirt flashing their identity cards, trooping into a nightclub and having a blast are over.

 Playing party-poopers are their bosses, following complaints of cops using their ID cards to gain entry and then creating a nuisance.

 This is absolutely unethical. No one in the force is allowed to do this, said Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south division). They are only allowed to enter such places with their superiors permission while conducting a raid or on the trail of a suspect.

 What is bad news for disc-hopping cops is good news for those running the nightclubs. This problem was getting out of hand. Every now and then, a big group would arrive and one of them would flash his identity card.

On a lean night, it becomes difficult to give such discounts, admits the manager of another nightclub frequented by off-duty policemen.

 There have even been reports of revelry giving birth to brawls involving cops.

 A policeman in party mode recently punched a disc regular in the face and also hurt his own hand when one of his punches hit the wall. In another incident, some policemen had raised a ruckus when refused liquor.

 Why are such rogue cops not brought to book? Those manning the gate in discs do not record the names of policemen. As a result, tracing the culprits is next to impossible, said a senior officer.

 Now, nightclub officials have been urged to challenge anyone identifying himself as a policemen to force entry. They have been told to alert the police station immediately. Officers-in-charge of all police stations where discotheques and other hangout places are located have been given instructions, said Kumar,

 The deputy commissioner (south) warned that if members of the force did not mend their ways, they will face strict punishment that may extend to suspension.

 So who in the force is allowed to disc-hop, officially? Only a section of officers from the detective departments anti-rowdy squad and watch section is empowered to enter such party places to keep an eye out for criminals.

 Thana theke aschi (Im from the police station) is not a line cops can use to throw their weight around in a nightclub, said a senior offi cer.

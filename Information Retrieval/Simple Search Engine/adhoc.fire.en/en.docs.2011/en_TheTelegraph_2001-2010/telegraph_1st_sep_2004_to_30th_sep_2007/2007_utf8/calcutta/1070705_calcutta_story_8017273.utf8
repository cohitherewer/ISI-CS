 The decomposed body of a 52-year-old woman was recovered from the ground floor of her brother-in-laws house in Salt Lake on Tuesday night.

 Police are clueless about the death of Tara Guhathakurta who shared the ground floor of IB 60 with her mentally-challenged brother but neighbours alleged foul play. The brother, Satyanarayan, 55, was found unconscious beside the body.

 We are probing the death from all possible angles, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 The house belongs to Taras sister Basanti and bother-in-law Partha Dutta. Tara might have died of her ailments. Her blood pressure was high, said Narayani Basu, a relative of Partha, who worked for a state-owned undertaking.

 For the past two days, the Duttas found the doors and windows of the ground floor locked. A foul smell emanated from inside. No one was responding to repeated knocks on the door. Last night, we informed the police, who broke open the door and recovered the body, Narayani added.

 Neighbours, however, alleged that the Duttas used to torture Tara and her brother. They often used to pressure the two to leave the house, so they could rent out the ground floor. Tara even contemplated suicide, said a neighbour, who claimed the woman frequented his house.

 Another neighbour claimed that Partha had built the house with financial help from Taras parents.

 Thats why Partha could not turn them away when they came to stay with his family after selling their Sodepur house. But he never treated them well, said the neighbour.

 Narayani denied the charges. Partha could not be contacted.

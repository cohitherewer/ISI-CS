 Hair care

 What: A hairstyling session with Javed Habib.

 Where: Javed Habib Hair Academy in Tollygunge.

 When: Friday.

 Tress talk: Hair-care tips, talk of trends and some hilarious chit-chat kept Javed scissorhands Habibs audience entertained.

 Rahul Boses character in Everybody Says Im Fine was inspired by me, said the hair expert, who claims to know just what his clients want by simply looking at their hair.

 If the crowd was impressed by his sense of ease and humour, he explained why: I was a very serious man before my marriage Marriage has taught me to laugh.

 Between laughs, his pupils for the day studiously took notes watching him streak a models hair red. Habib advised colouring hair in streaks rather than global colouring as it involved less chemicals and created a more striking look.

 Gold is the colour du jour, he advised. Not only does it look bright, it complements Indian skin. Straightening is still in, but Habib recommended extreme care for treated hair. Keep the hair short, around shoulder length. Our busy lifestyle doesnt allow us the time to take care of long hair. Layers are in, but not very short. Coloured and straightened hair need extra care, such as regular trimming and conditioning.

 For the winter, the stylist warned against the problem of dandruff. Washing hair in warm water in winter makes the scalp dry and results in dandruff, which makes the hair listless and also results in hair loss, he said. To cure dandruff, Habib suggested hot oil treatment at least once a week and use of an anti-dandruff shampoo. For the sultry Calcutta weather, he prescribed washing the hair daily. There is this myth that shampoo is bad for hair, whereas it helps in keeping the scalp clean, making the hair healthy, he stressed.

 Voiceover: The natural look is completely out. India is becoming global, and today style is beauty. Its baseless to say that conforming to trends doesnt suit everyone. I can give the same haircut to 10 people and make them look different, said Habib.

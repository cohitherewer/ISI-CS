The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 I will not get angry...

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA 

 FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANOTHER YEAR HAS PASSED, MAKES SOME 

 RESOLUTIONS AND PROMISES TO KEEP THEM

 I was trying to ignore the new year so far, as if it had not happened. But I cant any more. Theres too much evidence everywhere, including a spam message sent by someone called Heriberto that wishes me a Happy New Year and then goes on to say something like: Hello, we spoke a few days ago and Id like to confirm everything now. Please go over the information below and let me know if you have any questions. We are accepting your form. We need to confirm your details one more time. Just check the URL above and fill out our last form. Thank you, Heriberto. 

 I want to meet Heriberto, who dreams of speaking to me and would like to confirm things. A man who takes such a keen interest is rare. 

 For that I will have to be good. I will acknowledge that another year has passed and make new resolutions and keep them. 

 Here I go. 

 I will not be angry when I am pushing in a door 

 a revolving or swing door, take your pick and someone 

 from behind just swishes past me and jumps into the lift, 

 while I am still holding the door. In life and at shopping 

 malls, you are bypassed. I will accept it.

 I will not get angry with the lift. I could lodge a complaint 

 at the consumers forum against its makers, but I 

 wont, but I want to get it off my chest anyway. A 

 sign inside the lift at my office says 680 kg or 10 persons 

 are the maximum it allows. 

 But theres hardly room 

 for seven to eight persons, which I think is a safety strategy 

 and I dont mind that. But imagine I am stepping in, 

 the eighth person, and the shrill excess weight warning 

 goes off. 

 And those inside the lift dont 

 look 85 kg each and they look at me with a knowing look 

 and the lift door closes. Then the lift lifts. Life is unfair. 

 I will accept it too. 

 I will not be angry when its no rush hour and yet 

 just as I am to step inside the Metro rail compartment, 

 I am pushed in from behind. People are pushy. 

 I will not be angry when someone 

 calls me up and demands to know who is it he or she is speaking 

 to. 

 I will not be angry with the endless battle between the 

 state government, the high court and the green brigade on 

 the Book Fair, but just hope for a verdict soon. 

 I dont have a stand and 

 I want to exercise the right of having no stand. Or the 

 right to go to sleep whenever I please. 

 I will not get angry when I call someone and he burps into 

 the phone. 

 I will not get angry when the man in the car behind me is 

 honking, though we are stuck in the same traffic. 

 I will not be angry with Germaine Greer, though I believe 

 she is Mahesh Bhatt in disguise. She has something to say 

 on every occasion. 

 When television wildlife expert 

 Steve Irwin died, she said the animal world has finally 

 taken its revenge. When some Sylhetis in London were 

 fuming over Monica Alis Brick Lane, saying they could 

 not recognise themselves in the novel, she had written a 

 beautiful little piece, though, saying: It hurts 

 to be misrepresented, but there is no representation without 

 misrepresentation. 

 And now the author of The Female 

 Eunuch has held forth on Shilpa Shetty on Celebrity Big 

 Brother, accusing her of manipulating the show. 

 She could have just read Shilpa 

 some passages from her book. But I will not be angry with 

 Greer, though icons becoming silly is one of the saddest 

 things to watch. 

 I will not get angry with my colleague whose caller tune 

 is a synthesiser version of Blue Danube. He is always getting 

 phone calls. 

 I will not get angry when I find the person in before me 

 has messed up the loo. 

 I will not get angry when I have to buy overpriced mineral 

 water bottles at multiplexes. 

 Or when I am told there is no water available at foodchain 

 outlets: Madam, you have to buy it. 

 I will not be angry when I see a thin girl walking in front 

 of me. 

 In this way, I will be good. I will probably get to meet 

 Heriberto. But somehow he sounds too good to be true.

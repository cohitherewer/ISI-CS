 SOUMITRA DAS

 Raju Patels watercolour, on display at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture 

 An exhibition of a large body of works from artists trained at MS University in Baroda is on at Birla Academy of Art and Culture. It is a significant exhibition, given the display of sameness at all the galleries that have sprouted in every nook and corner and vacant flat of the city. You get to see something very different here and you may be in for a shock when you confront at least one work in an institution as straitlaced as this, and in a city as hidebound as Calcutta.

 The exhibition, Beyond Credos, is curated by Shivaji K. Panikkar, who teaches at the university. The works reflect the current situation in the country, though not in an obvious way. Most of the artists are quite young having been born in the 1960s and later. 

 The sweep of the works in different formats is tremendous. They address often with a sense of irony issues such as our splintered identity, gender roles, memory and nostalgia, the space around us and the media. Asutosh Bhardwajs huge canvas, with its two-headed young man, is all about the schizophrenia inherent in a culture such as ours. We are riven asunder by two worlds.

 Alluding to the suicidal birds of Jatinga, Lokesh Khodke examines the unsettling consequence of the changes effected in the past few years.

 Lavanya Mani appropriates the format of an antique map to examine with a certain degree of humour how red colour was produced from the Madder root. K.P. Rejis concern for environment is expressed with a touch of irony trees sprouting from jerrycans and heart-shaped pots. Nostalgia is given a Proustian twist in the series of three noses hung side by side.

 Soumen Dass canvas is concerned with space interiors and exteriors. Yet, it is the mirage-like quality of the painted surface that makes an impact. In the same way, Heeral Trivedi uses the image of Basanti Debi, one of the first women to spearhead the freedom struggle, as an icon without much recognition. Yet it is the painterly quality of the work that makes a lasting effect. 

 The exhibition demonstrates yet again how even traditional skills which enable an artist to paint a turnip to look like a turnip and nothing else can be used to explore issues hitherto untouched, some even taboo.

 The brazenness of Abir Karmakars self-image is difficult to confront, as may have been quite obvious to anybody who has visited the gallery of late. People are wary of examining it. Raju Patels delicate watercolour it has an insubstantial, even ethereal quality of gnarled feet turns a disability into an icon of empowerment. These are two of the most striking works in this significant show.

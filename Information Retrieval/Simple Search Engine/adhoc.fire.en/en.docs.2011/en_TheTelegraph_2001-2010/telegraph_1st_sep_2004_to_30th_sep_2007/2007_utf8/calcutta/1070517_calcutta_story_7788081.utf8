 A suspended university teacher who did not draw his salary for the past 11 years to protest his suspension has to be paid his arrears in full, ruled Calcutta High Court.

 On Wednesday, Justice D. Kargupta asked the Calcutta University authorities to pay Rs 30 lakh to Srimanta Kumar Raut, a reader in zoology at the Ballygunge Science College. The teacher should be allowed his salary by July this year. Theres no denying him that, said Justice Kargupta.

 The university had suspended Raut in June 1995 on charges of retaining some answer scripts of the M.Sc (zoology) examinations beyond the stipulated time.

 From July 1995, Raut refused to accept his salary cheques unless he was proved innocent. The university had suspended him illegally and on a flimsy ground, alleged Raut.

 For the past 11 years, my client has been starving. But he attended the university on a regular basis in spite of his suspension. He used to walk all the way to college from his Behala residence, said Rauts lawyer Uttam Majumdar.

 The university authorities withdrew the suspension order in 1998. But Raut continued refusing the pay slips and demanded that all his dues be cleared in a single instalment.

 As a result, Rs 30 lakh has accumulated in the universitys coffers since the teachers suspension in July 1995.

 Calcutta University is, however, not happy with the courts ruling. I have not seen the court order and so theres no question of making a comment before knowing what is said in the order, said Samir Bandyopadhyay, registrar. 

 But we are definitely going to challenge the judgment before a division bench, said the registrar.

 Raut will be completing 60 years in July. His lawyer said Raut had applied for re-employment according to a provision in the universitys rulebook, which says that a teacher can apply for re-employment after reaching 60 years of age, and before he or she reaches 65 years.

 Rauts appeal for re-employment with the university was tabled at the syndicate meeting on Tuesday, said an official. But the syndicate rejected the plea.

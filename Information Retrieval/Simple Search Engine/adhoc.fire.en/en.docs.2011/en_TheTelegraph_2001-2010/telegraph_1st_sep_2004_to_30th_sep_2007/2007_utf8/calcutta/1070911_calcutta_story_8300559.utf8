 Heaps of sand, bricks and stone chips by the side of the road have turned the EM Bypass stretches leading to Parama island a death trap.

 According to police records, 17 mishaps have taken place near the island in the last 45 days, claiming two lives.

 The traffic police blame reckless driving more than the obstructions for the mishaps. On Monday, a day after BPO employee Ananth Hariharan was crushed under the wheels of a bus near the island, the police, however, said that a pile of sand and bricks caused his motorcycle to veer off course.

 We have found out that the tyres of Hariharans two-wheeler skidded after he drove into a heap of sand. A bus coming from behind crushed the skull of the 36-year-old man under its wheels, said an officer of Tiljala police station. 

 Riding pillion on Hariharans motorcycle was his friend Austin Bernard, who has been admitted to Apollo Gleneagles Hospital. Doctors said on Monday that his condition was stable. 

 The building material lying on the road was brought for the widening of EM Bypass, said the police. The pile of sand and bricks lay on the road even on Monday.

 The EM Bypass is considered the only road in the city where motorists can hit the accelerator. Many vehicles fail to slow down in time and crash, said an officer.

 Hariharan was out on a joyride with two friends. The third person was on another motorcycle. Hariharan lost control after turning towards Chingrihata. On Monday, his body was handed over to relatives after post-mortem.

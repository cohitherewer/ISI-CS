 Among all the ways the country has found to wish its cricket team, heres a unique one. In a first of its kind initiative, the postal department on Tuesday released a special cover and postmark bearing a good luck message for Team India. 

 The event took place at Starmark on Lord Sinha Road where an exhibition of postage stamps and cricket memorabilia is also taking place over the next two days, after which it will shift to the stores Salt Lake address.

 We would like to associate with what our customers like. The proposal came to us at the beginning of the month and we wasted no time in acting on it, said Manojit Kumar, postmaster-general, Calcutta, West Bengal circle. 

 The postmark of a cricket ball dislodging the bails was designed by philatelist Dipok De who has been designing stamps since 1984. The original plan was to use actual wood for the bat and clay on the pitch for the cover. But we hardly had the time, he said.

 The 500 limited edition covers that have been issued will be available at the philatelic bureau of the GPO and will be given out to customers at Starmark. 

 The World Cup is a hyped event anyway but we want to popularise philately through it, said Gautam Jatia, CEO of Starmark, a relation of pioneering philatelist D.N. Jatia. 

 The Caribbean islands bring out the maximum cricket-related stamps. I wish India Post also showed similar interest, said Apurba Chakraborty whose collection is being used for the exhibition. 

 Other than the 2007 release on Tamil Nadu Cricket Association used for the special cover, the last time India had a stamp on cricket was 1996 with four issues paying tribute to Prof. Deodhar, Vinoo Mankad, CK Nayadu and Vijay Merchant, informed Kalyan Negal of Indian Philatelic Traders Association who has also contributed part of his collection for the show.

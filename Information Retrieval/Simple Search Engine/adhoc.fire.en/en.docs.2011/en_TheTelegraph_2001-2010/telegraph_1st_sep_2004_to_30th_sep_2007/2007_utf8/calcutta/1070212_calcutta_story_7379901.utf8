 Gunpoint robbery

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two men on a motorcycle snatched away at gunpoint a diary containing Rs 35,000 from an official of a New Delhi-based publishing house in front of an AJC Bose Road hotel on Sunday.

 Ajit Sharma, the 32-year-old official, has been staying at the hotel, near Camac Street, since Saturday. He left the premises and crossed the road around 10.30 am on Sunday to take a taxi to Yuva Bharati Krirangan, where his company had set up a stall at the Book Fair.

 Sharma said the men rode up to him as he waited for a taxi. The rider produced a piece of paper with an address written in Bengali and asked for directions. When the official said he could not read Bengali, the pillion-rider produced a pipe-gun and pointed it at Sharma, stated a senior officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 The men then snatched Sharmas plastic bag containing the diary, with the money inside. A few yards ahead, they took out the money and threw away the diary, added the officer.

 Investigation suggests the motorcycle had a Howrah registration number. Officers are trying to find out how the criminals knew of the cash inside the diary.

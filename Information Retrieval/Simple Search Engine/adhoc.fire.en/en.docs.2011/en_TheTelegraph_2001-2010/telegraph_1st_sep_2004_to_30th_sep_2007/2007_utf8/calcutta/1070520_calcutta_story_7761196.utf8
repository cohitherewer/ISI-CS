The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Poetry quite contrary

 Calcuttan Of The Week 

 Name: Bishnu Ghatak (picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha)

 Claim to fame: He is a poet who specialises in mirror-writing (writing in the reverse of the natural direction of a language) in Bengali. He has transcribed Sunil Gangopadhyays Neera series and Nirendranath Chakrabartys Ulanga Raja backwards. Now he is on to Tagores Shesher Kobita. The Mahabharata is another project.

 People dont believe that I can write this way and always ask for proof, he says, autographing in mirror-writing his only published work of poems, Amar Gandib, Amar Indradhonu. He also aspires to compose the highest number of poems. He has already written over 5,000. I will never go to the Guinness to claim a record. They must approach me, he insists, seated on a bed in his two-roomed rented apartment in Dum Dum. 

 Chequered days: Ghatak got involved in the Naxalite movement and could not take his final exams in Commerce from Krishnagar, but later earned a diploma in pharmacy. After working for the census department in Agartala, he quit to become a gateman in the Indian Roadways Corporation, an errand boy at a tea stall in Ranaghat and as a timekeeper for minibuses. 

 Marriage brought stability, and he graduated and also secured an economics degree. Today, he earns his living by giving private lessons in Bengali. To supplement his income, he officiates as a priest.

 Present: He has begun researching on the history of coin-casting. But he is reluctant to talk about it. He has traced his genealogy back to 10 generations from documents in the family.

 He is also working on building up a collection of quotations, intended for popular use. It stands at 508 now. Ghatak does not use the Internet to look up information, his scrapbook merely comprises newspaper cuttings. 

 On his own trip: He has one regret. People are only interested in the mirror-writing, and not in poesy, he laments.

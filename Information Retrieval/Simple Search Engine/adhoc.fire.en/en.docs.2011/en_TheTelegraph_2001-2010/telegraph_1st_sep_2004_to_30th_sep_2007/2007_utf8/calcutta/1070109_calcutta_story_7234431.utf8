 What: Launch of Venetia, a glass jewellery line.

 Where: Diagold outlets at Lee Road and Forum.

 When: Sunday afternoon.

 Take a look: Designer Varda Goenka has earlier worked with leather, wood and even cloth in her jewellery designs. Her latest interest is glass handmade in Italy by Italian masters specialising in Murano decorated artistic glass. Explains the designer: Murano, an island in Venice, is famous for its handblown glass work. A trip to Europe last year had me pondering over the jewellery wonders one could do with Murano glass. I have been working on the collection for the past three months.

 The effort is evident. Venetia, as the jewellery line is titled, scores high on the glam quotient original Murano glass inlaid with gold foils have been intricately studded with 22-karat gold and diamond settings. Globally, gold is coming back. Lots of colours and big pieces are in. The collection incorporates all of these. Glass has added a touch of innovation, adds Varda.

 The limited edition line is targeted at a niche clientele. Choose from chunky medallion sets, earrings, rings and watches. Design patterns are mostly geometric and abstract. Nature has been an occasional inspiration, too. Red and yellow splashes or a mish-mash of Prussian, sky and ocean blue or a black-red-yellow combination all this peppered with generous doses of gold foil form the coloured glass backdrop. The gold and diamond embellishment patterns are not over-the-top a wave here, a spiral there, bee-hive motifs, straight lines, florals. At times, the yellow metal has been rhodium polished to jazz up the look.

 The neckpieces are the real show-stealers. Pendants in inverted dew shapes, circles or even uncut Murano finishes look stunning. Imported Italian threads hold the pendants. The neckpieces come along with pretty earrings. Rings are broad and big. The collection of wrist watches is select. The bands are amber or white-coloured glass sprinkled with diamonds and gold. The dials with thin Murano glass edgings showcase a variety of illustrations.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from around Rs 10,000.

 Desert do

 What: Apno Gaon Rajasthan Mela.

 Where: Nicco Park. 

 When: December 23 to 31.

 Take a look: A miniature Rajasthan village, complete with traditional huts, market place and even camels, had been recreated for the occasion. To get a feel of rural life, visitors also got to try their hand at making clay pots, grinding grain and turning the chakki. Bonfires were lit for people to sit around and enjoy the folk dance and music being belted out. 

 No trip to Rajasthan is complete without a camel ride and so the organisers had made provisions for that, too.

 For foodies, the main attraction was Chowki Dhani, the special kitchen set up to serve the best of Rajasthani cuisine. The lip-smacking Khichdi, Bajre ki Roti and Malpua gave visitors a taste of the deserts culinary delights.

 Alongside the village affairs were star-studded stage performances every evening. Besides a devotional dance drama, dandiya night and a tribute to Mohammed Rafi, young singers Abhrokanti, Neha and Pawni of Zee TVs Li Champs fame were brought in to liven things up.

 A dance competition was judged by Tina-Hussain, the champion pair of Star Ones show Nach Baliye 2. 

 Voiceover: There is a whole generation of youngsters today who, though Rajasthani, are born and brought up here. This was our way of helping them connect with their roots, said Kamlesh Kejriwal, an executive committee member of the organising body, Salt Lake Lok Sanskriti.

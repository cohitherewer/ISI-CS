 Three armed youths took away Rs 1.25lakh in cash and jewellery from a Cornfield Road flat, after beating up its owner, a 45-year-old businesswoman, on Sunday. The maid she had employed about a week back is missing.

 Around 10.30 am, the men, in their mid-20s, walked into the flat in which Indira Rani lived alone. She was in her bedroom, preparing her shot of insulin. The maid, Kalpana, who had shown up for work around 20 minutes earlier, was readying breakfast.

 One of the youths trained a gun on me and asked for the keys to the three almirahs in the flat. When I refused to part with the keys, they started to beat me up mercilessly, Indira told Metro. 

 The robbers then tied me up and gagged me. Two of them ripped off the telephone wire and broke open a wooden almirah. The keys to the other two almirahs were inside. The men took out the valuables from the almirahs and ransacked the flat before leaving, the flat-owner added.

 Indira dragged herself to her neighbours flat. Kalpana could not be spotted anywhere. Indira then called up a close friend, who alerted Gariahat police station.

 Indira Rani has been living alone in the flat for over a decade. She would often change her maid. She recruited Kalpana without checking her antecedents. It seems she has paid for the mistake, said an officer of the police station.

 We have got leads and hope to crack the case soon, he added. The detective department is helping in the investigation. The officers said Kalpana had claimed to be from Lakshmikantapur, in South 24-Parganas.

 Calcutta experienced its first drizzle of the year on Tuesday evening. The rain coincided with a cold spell, with the minimum temperature pegged at 13.2 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal.

 The Met Office predicted a dip in the minimum temperature over the next 48 hours.

 The rain was caused by cloud formation due to development of an anti-cyclonic (clockwise) circulation over the Bengal-Orissa coast, said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.

 The anti-cyclonic circulation is expected to dissipate by Wednesday. This will lead to further lowering of the temperature, added Debnath.

 According to Met officials, cold winds from the north will cause a slide in the Celsius.

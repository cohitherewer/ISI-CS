 Environmentalists are rallying against the state governments move to shift the larger animals of Alipore zoo to Bhagwanpur mouza in the East Calcutta Wetlands, a Ramsar site where construction has been banned by the high court.

 Setting up a zoo will involve a lot of construction activities that cannot be allowed at the site, said Parikshit Gautam, director (wetlands), WWF-India.

 At a meeting that finalised the shift of the animals, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted that the proposed site, off the Bypass, falls within the wetlands, but said he was confident that necessary permission would be obtained from the East Calcutta Wetlands Management Authority.

 Chief technical officer of the Authority Nitai Kundu confirmed that the entire Bhagwanpur mouza falls within the East Calcutta Wetlands. He, however, added the Authority is yet get a proposal to set up the zoo in Bhagwanpur.

 The East Calcutta Wetlands has got the Ramsar recognition for its wise-use characteristics. Its the only wetlands in the world where sewage is treated naturally and used in fishery and agriculture, said wetlands expert Dhrubojyoti Ghosh, who had played a key role in getting the site recognised by the Ramsar bureau. Setting up a zoo in this ecologically fragile site will destroy the sewage-fed ecosystem.

 The wetlands will be consigned to history if the zoo is allowed to come up. Both construction activities and footfall will disrupt the ecosystem, warned environment activist Subhas Dutta. Alipore zoo, he pointed out, registers an annual footfall of around 19 lakh. We will oppose the state governments move in an appropriate forum.

 Gautam, of WWF-India, said the government should not have taken the decision before readying a comprehensive wetlands management plan. The move is not consistent with Ramsar guidelines.

 The proposal to shift the big animals to the Bhagwanpur address was ratified recently at a state wildlife board meeting, chaired by the chief minister.

 A note (a copy of which is with Metro) circulated among wildlife board members at the meeting stated that 500-600 acres of land will be required for setting up the zoo. Around 225 acres have already been identified. The government has also issued a notice inviting expressions of interest from zoo consultants.

 The state forest department has constituted a committee headed by the district magistrate, South 24-Parganas for the purpose of identification and acquisition of the required land, the document read. Its a priority project and we plan to shift the animals in 2009, forest minister Ananta Roy had earlier said.

 Mothers cry for justice

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They have killed my son. I want justice from the chief minister, cried Rizwanur Rahmans mother Kishwar Jahan at her Tiljala Lane home on Sunday.

 Holding her sons photograph to her chest, the 55-year-old widow wept inconsolably, surrounded by relatives. How will I live? she mumbled before fainting. She came to five minutes later and repeated her sons name for several minutes.

 Her eldest son Rukbanur said the family would lodge an FIR against the senior police officers who harassed and mentally tortured his brother.

 They have claimed that he committed suicide, but we will certainly not buy their story. There was foul play and even if he committed suicide, the police are responsible for that. We want a CBI inquiry, said Rukbanur.

 According to him, three senior officers had pressured his brother to leave his wife. It was none of their business. The chief minister asks his force to be people-friendly but look what they have done. We will do everything to ensure that the people behind his death are punished.

 The mood in the locality was sombre. There was widespread anger against police high-handedness. 

 Why were the policemen involved? is the question on everyones lips.

 They were adults and had the right to live as they wanted to. We live in a democratic country and this was not an exceptional case, said local resident Anwar Ali.

 Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya visited Rizwanurs house in Karaya and offered condolences to the family. Whoever is involved in his death will be punished. Whenever you need my services as a lawyer, you can call me, the mayor told Kishwar Jahan.

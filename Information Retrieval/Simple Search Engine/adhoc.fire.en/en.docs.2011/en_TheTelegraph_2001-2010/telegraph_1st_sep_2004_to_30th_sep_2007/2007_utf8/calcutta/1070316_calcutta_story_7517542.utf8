 Trees by the road will get a daily wash

 The heritage BBD Bag area witnessed an unusual site on Thursday morning: a pair of sprinkler vans washing roadside trees.

 Tree-washing, as part of the Calcutta Municipal Corporations effort to give the city a brighter and fresher look, will soon be part of the daily road-cleaning operation.

 At least 21 major roads across the city will be brought under the ambit of the drive, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 In the first phase, watering of roadside trees will be undertaken in the central business district, spread across BBD Bag, Esplanade and Camac Street, where there are around 1,200 trees. Until enough logistic support is arranged, tree-washing will be carried out twice a week in these areas, Bandyopadhyay added.

 The scene reminded me of my childhood days, when bhistis used to wash the roads daily in the morning, said chief engineer in the civic solid waste management department Arun Sarkar, who supervised the inaugural session on Thursday.

 The department has commissioned two sprinkler vans for watering the trees and two more will be ready before the Puja. 

 Tree-washing will continue round-the-year, except during monsoon, said Sarkar.

 Experts think regular washing of roadside trees will increase their life span.

 Horticulturist Ranojit Samanta said the thick layer of dust deposited on the leaves causes respiratory problems for the trees and also hampers photosynthesis. 

 Washing of roadside trees in a city like Calcutta is needed, especially after the dry winter, where there is maximum deposition of dust, pointed out Samanta.

 The former Trinamul Congress-BJP board had thought of a similar operation, but it had to be grounded after a few runs.

 Callous couple in custody

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Manas Chakraborty, 37, and wife Lipika Chakraborty, 33, were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days on Thursday for illegally confining and torturing their minor domestic help and violating the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act.

 Sumita Oraon, 11, worked day and night at their 878/1 Sarat Chatterjee Road home in Howrah for eight months without being paid a paisa. She was confined to the house and ill-treated.

 The girl from a village in South Dinajpur was freed from the couples clutches by neighbours late on Tuesday. Saibal Ganguli, who led the rescue act, then lodged a complaint against the Chakrabortys with Shibpur police station.

 Manas, who works with a private firm, and Lipika, a South-Eastern Railway employee, were booked under various sections of the Child Labour Act. 

 Before Manas and Lipika were produced before the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) in Howrah, Sumita recorded her statement before the third judicial magistrate.

 The court decided to send the minor girl to Liluah Home as her mother, Arati Oraon, was not present in court.

 The Chakrabortys lawyer moved a bail petition stating that they had been victimised by some neighbours. Public prosecutor Samir Dey opposed the bail petition arguing that this was a glaring example of crime against children.

 The CJM rejected the bail petition. The couple will be produced again on June 7.

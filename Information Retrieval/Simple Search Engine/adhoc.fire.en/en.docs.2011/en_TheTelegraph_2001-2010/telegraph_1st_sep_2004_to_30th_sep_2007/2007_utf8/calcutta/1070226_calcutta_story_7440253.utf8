 Plight of the daughters

 - Woman driven out of home delivers girl child, dies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jyoti Das, 27, was driven out of home a month ago by her in-laws, who feared she would give birth to a girl. 

 She delivered a girl on February 5 in RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and returned to the same concrete slab with her child on February 14. On Saturday afternoon, local people found the infant crying, while the mother lay still on the slab. They took Jyoti to hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

 The child is now in the safe custody of an NGO, thanks to officers of Sinthee police station. The child was taken to a healthcare unit, where she was examined, and then sent to the NGO, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Ranjit Chakraborty, a city-based gynaecologist, suspects the woman had died of cardiac arrest as a consequence of anaemia and malnutrition.

 According to local rickshaw-pullers and vendors, who had been Jyotis friends and protectors for the past month, the woman begged for her meals on the station premises.

 Anadi Sarkar, a rickshaw-puller, said: Jyoti told us her husband Chhotu and the in-laws drove her out of home in Bongaon, North 24-Parganas, as they feared she would give birth to a girl. 

 The hawkers and rickshaw-pullers took Jyoti to RG Kar Hospital when she went into labour. Our wives came to her aid when she returned with the child. We also bought milk for the baby, said Shankar Rabidas, a shoeshine.

 The incident proves that not only are female babies discriminated against, but that mothers, too, are punished for giving birth to a girl, asserted social worker Kakoli Bhattacharya.

 Court on cop role in strike

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Monday directed police to assist the Bharat Petroleum management in keeping the companys outlets open during an employees strike called by two unions on April 18. The police will have to ensure that willing employees can work on the day of the strike, Justice Dipankar Dutta said in his order.

 He also directed the police not to allow the employees on strike to hold demonstrations within 50 yards of the companys offices, bottling plants and petrol pumps on April 18.

 The order followed a petition by the firms management. It said there could be a breach of peace by a section of employees on the day of the strike.

 Most of the employees are willing to work on April 18, but the union members are planning to prevent them from entering office, the companys advocate Pradosh Mallik told the court.

 According to a Supreme Court ruling, the strike is illegal. No one has the right to prevent willing employees from joining work, he added.

 A Bharat Petroleum spokesman stated: Earlier, the court had issued a similar directive to the police. But the cops failed to follow the order.

 Bharat Petroleum Workers Union and Bharat Petroleum Employees Union have called the strike. 

 According to a source, the company management has decided to move a case before the high court on Tuesday calling for the strike to be declared illegal.

Kicking off with a space-efficient, no-frills, five-star business hotel, boasting 200 rooms with a high-end retail rendezvous and smart office blocks. Carrying the connect forward with an international-standard golf course and golf villas

 With upcountry real estate majors like Unitech and DLF having made their presence felt in the city with mega projects, a southern family of first-generation hoteliers is planning an entry into boomtown Calcutta.

 The Chancery Hotels group ventured into the hospitality industry 13 years ago with a vegetarian hotel, Siddharth, in Mysore, and now has The Chancery Pavilion, a five-star business hotel in the heart of Bangalores CBD. It wants to ride the Calcutta crest.

 We would prefer New Town Rajarhat or Sector V as the site, with the Bypass as an alternative. We are planning a retail-commercial-hospitality combo in tie-up with a local partner who has a land parcel, Taposh Chakraborty, president, The Chancery Hotels group, told Metro in Bangalore.

 The Chancery Group is also keen on creating an international-standard golf course in Siliguri, dotted with golf villas, a model proposed to be replicated on the fringes of Calcutta. Company officials have met state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and tourism secretary G.D. Gautama recently to discuss the proposal.

 Chakraborty, who left Calcutta in 1976 to carve out a niche in the hospitality trade, now shapes The Chancerys growth plans. He is also driving the groups eastward foray. 

 The proposed city business hotel is being formatted as the preferred address for the one-minute manager with 24-hour check-in/out, business services, travel desk, restaurant and laundry, a health club and multi-station, all-day dining.

 It will be modelled on the lines of The Chancery Pavilion in Bangalore, conceptualised by K. Chengamma Raju, chairman, and K.C. Chandrashekhar Raju, managing director.

 The difference will be the retail and commercial block we are planning adjacent to the hotel tower and the two properties will complement each other, Chakraborty said.

 Puri and the Sunderbans also feature on the hotel chains expansion map in the east. The Chancery Group hopes to invest around Rs 240 crore in seven hotels across the country in the next five years.

 Ready to rock

 Live music always rocks. Happening across eight cities all over the country, the ongoing Pubrock Festival already has the music-loving youth in its thrall. As part of the festival, Delhi-based rock bands Them Clones and The Superfuzz are slated to perform in the city on two consecutive nights, promising to send the audience to dizzy heights of ecstasy with their unique brand of rock n roll. Featuring tonight is The Superfuzz, a garage-rock trio which burst on the scene last year. Full of raw energy and zest, the trios original compositions are based on meaningful themes that are put into sharp perspective through extremely catchy notes. Performing tomorrow are Them Clones (picture along), a band known for their alternative rock tracks. Playing a mixed set of originals and covers, their music is influenced by grunge and metal to electronica, techno, international pop and Indi-pop.

 Event: Performance by Delhi-based rock bands When: Today and tomorrow; 9 pm onwards Where: The Park, Someplace Else

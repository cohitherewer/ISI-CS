 One death, nine arrests, including victims father

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The unnatural death of a 24-year-old housewife in Sonarpur, on the citys southern fringes, has led to the arrest of her father, husband, a doctor and six others.

 The doctor, a homoeopath, has been charged with issuing a false death certificate, while the father is accused of not informing police about the death.

 Police found strangulation marks around the neck of Supriya Mondal, who was reportedly found hanging by husband Ratan at their home on Sunday evening.

 But the doctor, Nakul Das, wrote that the woman had been suffering from asthma and died of cardiac failure, said an officer of Sonarpur police station.

 Ratan and Supriya had a love marriage two-and-a-half-years ago. Supriya gave birth to a daughter, Mishti, in January.

 Ratan, who owns an autorickshaw, told the police that he left home briefly on Sunday afternoon. On his return, he found his wife hanging from the ceiling of their bedroom.

 He said he immediately informed his parents, who live nearby, said the investigating officer. After the parents arrived, the family brought down the body and approached the homoeopath for a death certificate. Armed with the certificate, the Mondals and a few neighbours took the body to the Siriti burning ghat without informing the police.

 Sonarpur police station, however, got to know about the death from a source and a team, led by officer-in-charge Basudeb Das, rushed to the crematorium to bring back the body. The team was helped by Behala police.

 Following an inquest in the presence of the block development officer of Sonarpur, the body was sent for post-mortem.

 Apart from Ratan, his father-in-law Kishore De and the doctor, those arrested were his father Manik, one of his cousins and four neighbours of the Mondals. The neighbours had allegedly accompanied the family to the crematorium.

 An officer said the Mondals must have offered money to Kishore, whose financial condition is not sound, to keep the matter from the police.

 The doctor, he added, was bribed Rs 50 to issue the death certificate. 

 The superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), S.N. Gupta, said: We are trying to find out why the family was trying to conceal evidence.

 You share your birthday with...

 Diane Lane, actress

 You communicate well with people. You are an optimist with high hopes for the future. You easily take control of the most difficult of situations. You may not have many friends but you will always be close to the ones you have. You learn fast and you have a good memory. Kusum Bhandari

 An eight-year-old boy was crushed to death under the wheels of a speeding Qualis that mounted a pavement on Coal Berth Road in the port area on Tuesday morning. Two other pedestrians sustained serious injuries.

 A mob beat up the driver, damaged the vehicle and tried to set it on fire. The road rage continued for over two hours, with stones being hurled at policemen when they arrived at the spot.

 The accident occurred around 10.45am when the driver of the Qualis lost control, mounted a pavement, knocked down three bystanders and smashed into a lamp post.

 Eight-year-old Suraj Kumar Mahato and two others were taken to SSKM Hospital. Suraj was declared brought dead, while the condition of the other two was critical. One of them was identified as Bijoy Kumar Chowhan, 40, a resident of Karl Marx Sarani.

 It was a clear case of rash driving. The vehicle belonging to South Eastern Railway was speeding along when the driver suddenly lost control, said Jawaharlal Dhole, officer-in-charge of South Port police station.

 Suraj stayed with his father in a nearby slum and was returning from a school run by an NGO. The two injured persons were sipping tea when the car mounted the pavement, added Dhole.

 A mob led by local Congress MLA Ram Pyare Ram damaged the vehicle and thrashed the driver. A road-blockade was put up for over two hours protesting police failure to check rash driving leading to fatal accidents in the area.

 Things turned ugly when some policemen arrived and the protesters pelted them with stones. Two constables were injured.

 A large police contingent had to be deployed to finally restore order around 1.10pm.

 The police later arrested the driver and charged him with rash and negligent driving, which is bailable.

 Rash driving has become the bane of this stretch owing to police inaction, alleged Mohammed Arman, who had witnessed the accident.

 Blind chess whiz has no study funds

 He lost his sight when he was four and both his parents before he could reach age 15.

 His daily-wager elder brother was his sole source of support, but that did not deter him from honing his talent in chess.

 However, a keen sense of self-respect drove 25-year-old Dibakar Pal, a champion in a series of state and national-level tournaments, out of his brothers house in Haldia, where he was feeling neglected.

 A sepoy recognised him while he was loitering near Alipore Bodyguard Lines a couple of days ago and brought him to his barracks. I first saw him at a district-level tournament in Hooghly two years ago, where he caught everyones attention. I am trying to do something for him, said Samaritan cop Debasish Banerjee.

 Joint commissioner (armed forces) Zulfiquar Hassan said: We must all help this talented youth.

 Dibakar stood third for three consecutive years, from 1999, in the National Visually-Handicapped Chess Tournament and was twice champion in the Eastern Region Visually-Handicapped Chess Tournament. He stood first five times in the state-level Visually-Handicapped Chess Tournament. Last month, he could not go to Mumbai to participate in a national-level meet because he could not raise Rs 2,500.

 Recalling his tragic tale, Dibakar said: I lost my sight when I was four and my mother when I was in Class II. My father died before I was 15.

 After passing Madhyamik with 75 per cent marks, he took admission in Scottish Church College but could not afford to continue his studies. I went to the college for a day and realised it would not be possible for me to stay in the city and keep attending classes.

 He returned to his brothers family, but in a few years, found himself unwanted in the household. 

 He also knocked on the doors of Writers Buildings, where an official snubbed him: Aamra karo bhater byabostha kori na (We dont arrange for anyones livelihood). 

 Dibakar had to finally quit his brothers house on February 24, relying on destiny.

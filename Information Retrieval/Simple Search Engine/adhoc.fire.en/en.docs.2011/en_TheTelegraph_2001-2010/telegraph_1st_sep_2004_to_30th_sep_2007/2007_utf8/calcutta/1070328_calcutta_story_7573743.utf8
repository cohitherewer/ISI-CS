The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mercury on ascent

 - Hot, dry wind from the west

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Its not yet April, but the heat is on. And it is soon going to get hotter still.

 The weatherman on Tuesday warned that the maximum temperature is likely to go up by a couple of degrees Celsius over the next 48 hours.

 The highest temperature recorded during the day was 36.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal. 

 Director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore G.C. Debnath said the mercury has shot up as moist air is no longer blowing in from the Bay of Bengal and has been replaced by hot and dry wind from western India.

 In the absence of a southerly wind from the sea, the humidity level has dropped. Moreover, a hot and dry wind has started blowing in from the western part of the country. These two factors have made the weather hot and dry. The maximum temperature is likely to rise by one or two degrees in the next 48 hours, said Debnath.

 The minimum humidity on Tuesday was only 28 per cent, down one per cent from Monday.

 The lack of moisture in the atmosphere has manifested itself in the form of a cloudless sky, pointed out a Met official. 

 As there is no cloud, the sun is beating down on the ground. This, along with the hot wind from the west, is causing discomfort, he added.

 Norwesters, too, have disappeared with the drop in the humidity level. If there is no moisture in the atmosphere, how can there be clouds and then, subsequently, Norwesters? asked a Met official.

 The last Norwester was on Thursday evening. From Friday, the wind pattern changed and hot air started blowing from the west, said an official.

 We will have Norwesters again as soon as wind starts blowing in from the sea. We cant say for sure when that will happen. It is not unnatural for the wind pattern to change suddenly around this time, added the official.

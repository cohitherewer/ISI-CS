Life

 A moment, meant to be

 With Dr Deepak Chopra set to arrive at 6.30 pm for an evening presented by Calcutta Park Street Round Table and The Telegraph, eager Calcutta was at The Oberoi Grand all dressed up and all ears well before the clock struck 6.

 The excitement was understandable. The soul doctor was to address the citys soul, to change perspectives in the next couple of hours or so, answer audience questions and round it off with a book-signing session and dinner.

 Wednesday evening began with Chopra discussing human beings, because they are at a precarious stage at the moment. 

 He said they are diabolical, dangerous and are causing extinction of other species and even endangering their own. Yet, humans are the only species so aware and conscious.

 Setting the stage with this paradox, Chopra began to explore the possibility of consciously participating in the nature of evolution. A reality we can explore through the eyes of the soul a deeper domain of awareness.

 Chopras talk touched upon various topics with lots of ready references. Names like Rabindranath Tagore, Sri Aurobindo, Oscar Wilde, William Blake and Sufi poet Rumi featured frequently but the Vedanta and the Bhagavad Gita remained the soul of the two-hour speech.

 Talking points

 The 

 world is a discontinuity though it appears to 

 be continuous. Just like a reel of film that needs to spin 

 at a certain speed to look continuous but is in reality 

 just some discontinued moments. Everything is a vibration, 

 comprising on and off.

 In this discontinuity or off, there is no energy, no information, no space-time and no objects. There are only possibilities that exist. Everything is co-related. There is uncertainty, quantum leap and an observer effect.

 This all adds up to consciousness, something that ancient Indian rishis knew too well we are not in the world, it is in us. We are not in the body it is in us. We are not in the mind it is in us.

 And the seven spiritual laws of success, prescribed by the good doctor:

 Law of pure potentiality 

 (every problem is an opportunity in disguise)

 Law of giving

 Law of karma (or cause and effect)

 Law of least effort

 Law of intention and desire

 Law of detachment

 Law of dharma or purpose. 

 True spirituality, said Chopra, can be measured by two questions how effortlessly can you manifest your being and how easy is life for you? 

 Never question the moment, it is meant to be.

 Synchronicity is everything. It is a conspiracy of karmic relationships. Never ignore coincidences. They are opportunity and preparedness coming together.

 Question time

 The floor was then thrown open to questions. Calcutta lapped up the chance to shoot spiritual queries at the new-age guru. 

 They ranged from yoga to allopathic science, from rebirth to karmic connections, from god to consciousness... and Chopra answered them all. Next up was a book-signing session. A table was set on stage, sprinkled with red rose petals and Deepak Chopra titles. 

 Many members from the 600-plus audience queued up to grab a title and get it signed by the author. Books worth Rs 1 lakh sold in around 40 minutes. It was only when the books ran out, did the signing spree stop.

 After-effect

 Calcutta seemed super pleased with its date with the doc. While some like Sheetal Jhunjhunwala, familiar with pranic healing, felt such a session is a great refresher course to learn the lessons of life better, others like Siddharth Bansal were upbeat about the knowledge gained in the course of one winter evening.

 After listening to Dr Chopra, I recalled a series of synchronicity in my life. Looking back, now I know they were coincidences that were meant to happen, smiled Circler Alka Poddar.

 Sign-off

 GoodLife caught up with Chopra minutes after the talk to find out whether he had managed to connect with the soul of Calcutta. 

 I think I managed to connect with the soul very much. The talk went off very spontaneously and representatives from Bengal Tagore, Sri Aurobindo, Sri Ramakrishna came up naturally, smiled Chopra.

 And yes, those who want to get hooked on to Chopra and attempt a change in perspective by reading one of his books, heres the one must-read the doctor recommends: Read Power, Freedom and Grace.

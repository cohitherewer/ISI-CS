 Rap, racism and rights

 Birmingham-born Benjamin Zephaniah has come a long way from his two-year stint in a juvenile institution for violence. The human rights activist, poet and musician even turned down an MBE (Member of the British Empire) in 2003 by saying it reminded him of how his ancestors were raped and brutalised.

 The dub poet and internationalist, often referred to as the black voice of Britain, is in the city for the second time.

 On Tuesday afternoon, he was at Jadavpur University, reciting poems and answering questions from students. While some were curious about his stylistic influences (I used to do toasting, which is a kind of rapping over reggae), others wanted to know about improvisation in his performances (I never rehearse my poems in the mirror).

 One student asked about race in England. Zephaniah replied: The most dangerous form of racism, institutional racism, still exists.

 On Monday evening, Zephaniah performed at GD Birla Sabhagar, addressing a wide range of issues in his poetry, executed with rhythmic fluency. British political correctness received a pasting. In a poem titled London Breed, he celebrated the citys unique cultural mesh. Before reciting the verses, Zephaniah explained to the audience the inspiration behind them. 

 In a chat with Metro the day before the performance, Zephaniah waxed lyrical about Calcutta, developments around the globe and his tastes in music. He expressed sadness at the Nandigram killings and said: Its positive that people are making their voices heard.

 Although he is certainly not an economist, Zephaniah found the different rates of development in India and China (where he spends much of his time) very interesting. The thing about development in China is that people think there are never any protests, but that is untrue people do protest. 

 Zephaniah, an avowed vegan, was interested to hear that the first McDonalds has opened in Calcutta. I suppose thats inevitable. I just hope that all the incredible food here doesnt suffer because of chains like McDonalds. Everywhere I go you see McDonalds and it is so boring, he stated.

 Zephaniah expressed enthusiasm for a wide range of music. If I were to make a compilation for somebody, there would be all kinds of stuff on it from Bob Marley to Bob Dylan and The Sex Pistols to Daft Punk. I cant listen to just one type of music, the rapper stressed.

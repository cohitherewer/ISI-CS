 The state government is gearing up to crack down on sound and plastic pollution ahead of the autumn festivities, a little more than two months away.

 While officials of the environment, transport and home departments met at Writers Buildings on Tuesday to discuss ways to curb noise pollution, a meeting to tackle the plastic menace has been scheduled for Wednesday.

 A team comprising representatives of the state pollution control board, transport department and police will soon carry out raids to seize air horns, crackers and other sources of sound pollution, said M.L. Meena, the state environment secretary, who chaired Tuesdays meeting.

 We will keep a watch on trucks bringing in banned crackers from other states. The pollution control board will use hidden cameras planted by traffic police at various points to detect violators, added Meena, who is also chairman of the state-level noise monitoring committee.

 Apart from seizing air horns (banned since 1996) and crackers, the government will see to it that vehicles honking in silence zones do not get away scot-free. The areas around hospitals, educational institutions and Raj Bhavan are among those identified as silence zones.

 Unlike in previous years, the raids this time will be conducted regularly, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the senior law officer in the state environment department.

 ENT specialist Dulal Bose, who attended the meeting, pointed out that regulatory steps will not achieve much unless there is widespread awareness about the effects of pollution.

 Accepting his suggestion, the government decided to launch a campaign against pollution among school students in September.

 Wednesdays meeting on plastic pollution is likely to be attended by municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, environment minister Sailen Sarkar, the director-general of police, members of the state-level plastic pollution controlling committee, mayors of all municipal corporations in the state and pollution control board officials.

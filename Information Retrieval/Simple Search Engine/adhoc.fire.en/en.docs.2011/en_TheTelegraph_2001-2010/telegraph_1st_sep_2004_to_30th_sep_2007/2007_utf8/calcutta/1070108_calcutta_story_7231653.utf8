The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lack of awareness equals filthy roads

 Growing concern: A garbage 

 dump in the Santoshpur area. A Telegraph picture

 Ruma Saha: Many residents 

 in our area are in a habit of throwing garbage on the road. 

 They can easily dispose of the garbage in nearby vats or 

 hire sweepers to clean up the mess. Many roads in our area 

 are turning into vats. Can you punish those who litter public 

 roads? 

 The CMC is planning a new enactment to prevent this nuisance. But identifying the offender is the main hurdle. No one will admit that he or she has thrown garbage on the road. Keeping a 24-hour vigil is also very difficult. Therefore, the civic officials have decided to launch an awareness campaign for the local residents. But cleanliness of an area depends on its residents. They must protest against such ill practices on the roads. I would like to point out that the local residents around the crossing of West Road and South Road are not very vigilant. The area is gradually turning into a vat.

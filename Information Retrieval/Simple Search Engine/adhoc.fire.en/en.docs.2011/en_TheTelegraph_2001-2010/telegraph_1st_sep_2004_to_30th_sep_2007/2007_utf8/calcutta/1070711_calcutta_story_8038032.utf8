 Jobs aplenty for JU arts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If jobs can rain on the engineering and science departments at Jadavpur University (JU), the arts department cannot lag far behind.

 The economics department organised corporate placements this year and the results are encouraging.

 Of the 23 masters students who appeared for the interviews, 15 were selected. The salaries offered ranged from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5.7 lakh per annum, said Joyashree Roy, the head of the department.

 The initiative was taken in association with the placement cell and alumni. We are trying to put a system in place in the department, whereby firms will come recruiting each year, added Roy.

 Only a few companies, like Telco, used to come to the department for management trainees. But thanks to the departments initiative, companies like Genpact, Symphony, Tata Motors Finance and Indian Market Research Bureau are also recruiting students.

 The Forum for Arts Students (FAS) also helped in the placement. Its efforts in 2005 saw about 350 arts students being recruited by media companies and BPOs, claimed Ritam Dutta, an ex-student and a founding member of FAS.

 Recruitment has increased in the past two years as a result of the information technology boom. Companies like CTS, Infosys and Accenture have also recruited from the humanities departments, with salaries ranging from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh, said Siddhartha Bhattacharya, the officer (placement and training) at the university.

 However, several arts wings are outside the corporate loop. Amit Bhattacharya, the head of the history department, agreed that the initiative was limited to the placement cell and his department made no such attempt.

 Banks and media houses recruit from the English and economics departments. In our department, recruitment has always been sporadic, said Reetamarghya Bhattacharya, a postgraduate student of international relations at JU, stressing the need for a structured effort by the departments to place their students.

 There is a section on the campus that is disenchanted. The response of the arts students has always been less enthusiastic than that of the engineering departments. When Compaq Infobase came recruiting, many arts students declined to join. The jobs offered were deemed too ignominious, added Roy.

 Body swap in hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The relatives of a man run over by a train were given the body of a drowned man at NRS Hospital morgue on Wednesday afternoon. The drowned mans son later claimed that the body he had been handed over was not that of his fathers.

 Krishna Ghosh and Uttam Das, in their early 40s, died in mishaps on Tuesday. Krishna, a resident of Lake Town, drowned in a pond, while Uttam, who lived in Kasba, was run over by a train. The bodies were sent for post-mortem.

 When Uttams relatives came to the morgue to take his body, the person in charge handed over Krishnas body to them. It was around 4pm. The body was tightly wrapped in a white cloth. The men at the morgue did not ask us to identify the body. We also didnt take a look to avoid a shock, recounted Uttams elder brother Tapan.

 Some time after he and his relatives had left for the crematorium, Krishnas relatives reached the morgue for his body. When the body could not be found, the police officers called up Uttams relatives, who were then half-way to the crematorium, and asked them to come back to the morgue with the body. 

 Both sets of relatives were taken inside the morgue for identification of the bodies. Tapan said he could not identify his brother as his face had got distorted beyond recognition. Krishnas elder son Sanjay, on the other hand, claimed that his fathers body was not in the morgue and the police were trying to force him to take the wrong body.

 Confusion reigned till 7pm, when Uttams relatives identified his body and took it for cremation. The other set of kin, however, refused to accept the body that police said was Krishnas. If necessary, we will go in for a DNA test, said Sanjay.

 The deputy commissioner of police (II), G.N. Mukherjee, said Krishnas relatives had failed to identify the body as it was bloated and the face was distorted. The body was not taken for cremation till 10pm.

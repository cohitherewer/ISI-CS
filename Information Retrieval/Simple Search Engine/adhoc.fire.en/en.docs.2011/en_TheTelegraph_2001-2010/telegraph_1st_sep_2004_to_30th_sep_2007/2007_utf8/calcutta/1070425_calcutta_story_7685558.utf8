 A haven for addicts and gamblers in north Calcutta is set to be turned into a citizens plaza.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is exploring a proposal from local MLA Sadhan Pande that a lane connecting Duff Street with Hedua be made a plaza, complete with an open-air library, an evening caf and other amenities.

 We are conducting a feasibility study on the MLAs proposal, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Local residents had initially decided to submit a petition to the CMC for closing down the lane that becomes a den of drug abuse and gambling at night. When they approached Pande and sought his support for their demand, he came up with the plaza proposal.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the lane lies between Scottish Church College and its staff quarters at Urquhart Square, in Hedua.

 The lane is 100 metres long, with a 1.5-m-wide pavement on either side. Strewn with garbage, the lane does not have any residential address on record. 

 A cooking gas agent utilises the space for unloading cylinders during the day.

 The municipal commissioner said: A project report for the plaza has been prepared by the Consultancy Engineering Services. Civil engineers are examining the plan and the project cost has been estimated at Rs 40 lakh. 

 Provisions have to made in the design for two gates to be used by the residents of the college staff quarters.

 The MLA said: We do not want funds from the CMC. We only want them to give us the permission. We will arrange the funds on our own.

 Car theft kingpin arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After an undercover chase for over a month, sleuths on Tuesday night arrested Krishna Kumar Singh a Chapra-based schoolteacher from Howrah railway station for running a vehicle-theft racket across the city. 

 Police said that during his interrogation, Singh confessed of carrying out at least 50 vehicle thefts in the city with his gang members. 

 He had masterminded the thefts sitting at home in Chapra town. His men were spread across the city. They pick up cars from parking lots or residential areas, said Bimal Kumar Sanfui, officer-in-charge of Jorasanko thana.

 Sanfui said a hunt was launched after a series of vehicle thefts in March-April in the Jorasanko area. 

 In March, three cars were stolen. Two more cars were stolen on the night of April 2. That struck us. We received a tip-off that one of the cars had left for Bihar. We alerted our counterparts and the vehicle was intercepted at Nawada. Two of Singhs gang members were arrested, he added.

 Following the arrest, a thorough search was launched in Bihar and Bengal. 

 We had sent a team to Asansol. But they couldnt trace Singh, as his photograph was not available. We prepared a portrait and circulated it in police stations across the state and Bihar, an investigating officer said. 

 On Tuesday night, a team of officers, pretending to be passengers, trapped Singh at Howrah station, when he had come to see off his family.

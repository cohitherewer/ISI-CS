 Transparent vision of nature

 A noted commercial artist of yesteryears, Shyamal Sen makes a truly inspiring comeback with Macrocosm 3, the ongoing exhibition of transparent watercolours. One of the foremost painters working on this medium, his works express an astonishing simplicity of style and treatment which, at best, cleverly disguises his maturity and stature as an accomplished artist. A staunch believer in the old school of watercolour painting, he uses rich, vibrant colours interlaced with muted tones, to achieve dramatic visual effects. His current series of works is based on the theme of nature and its pure, virgin beauty.

 Event: An exhibition of watercolours by Shyamal Sen When: Till May 9; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Gallery 79, 79 Raja Basanta Roy Road, 1st floor

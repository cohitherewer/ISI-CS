 Ten-month-old Arpan Mondal, son of a dailywager, had been suffering from Ventricular Septal Defect, a congenital heart disorder that cannot be cured without surgery.

 We approached various voluntary groups for money for the operation, but could raise only Rs 20,000, said Arpans father Pintu, who lives in Batanagar.

 Help finally came from Rotary Club of Calcutta Mahanagar (RCCM) and Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS). Arpan was operated on free at the hospital in January.

 RCCM, under its Healthy Little Hearts project, is collaborating with RTIICS and BM Birla Heart Research Centre for sponsoring open heart surgeries on children whose parents cannot afford the cost of treatment. 

 The project took off in July last year and till now, 47 children have undergone open heart surgeries. Our target is to sponsor 100 surgeries a year, said Shekhar Mehta, chairman of the project and an RCCM member.

 Under the project, the surgeons do not charge their fees, while the other costs, including that of medicines, are borne by the Rotarians.

 It is necessary to raise awareness about childrens heart disease, which is quite alarming, said Devi Shetty, chairman of Asia Heart Foundation. Shetty was at RTIICS on Sunday to meet a group of children who had undergone surgeries at the hospital.

 With the number of cases increasing, there are plans to bring down the cost of surgery further, said Rupak Barua of BM Birla Heart Research Centre.

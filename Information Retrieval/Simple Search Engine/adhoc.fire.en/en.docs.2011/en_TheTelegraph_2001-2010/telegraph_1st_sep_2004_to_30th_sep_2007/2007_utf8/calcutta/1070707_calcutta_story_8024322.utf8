 The human predicament

 As part of Odeon 2007, the seventh edition of a festival of plays hosted by Hutchison Telecom East Ltd., this weekend witnesses the staging of two plays that highlight the isolation and confinement of human lives in two vastly different historical and social contexts. To be performed this evening is Sthanankan, a play that deals with the disintegration of inter-personal relationships in a world devoid of morality. It introduces us to a couple, Abin and Manasi, who live in self-imposed exile within the walls of their own home. Direction: Debashish Sengupta. Gopichand (a scene from the play appears right), to be staged tomorrow, is based on an ancient folk epic. It narrates the extraordinary journey of its protagonist, on his way to live the life of an ascetic, leaving behind his two wives and his royal responsibilities. Direction: Rishi Mukhopadhyay.

 lEvent: Festival of plays featuring Sthanankan by Belghoria Ethic (today at 6.30 pm) and Gopichand by Naba Mayukh Nattya Sangstha (tomorrow at 6.30 pm) lWhere: Star Theatre

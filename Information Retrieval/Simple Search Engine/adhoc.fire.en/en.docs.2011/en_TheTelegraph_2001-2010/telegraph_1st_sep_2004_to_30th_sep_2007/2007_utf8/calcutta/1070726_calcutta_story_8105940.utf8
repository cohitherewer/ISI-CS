 Theft at mall shop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An employee of a shop in Forum, the mall on Elgin Road, was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly stealing around Rs 1.5 lakh on Tuesday night.

 The man stole the money from the cash register of First Impression, on the second floor, while it was being shut around 9.30pm, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner (south). The entire amount has been recovered from his house in Howrah.

 The employees of the shop, however, said that one of them reported for work around 10am on Wednesday and saw the three locks missing from the shutter. She and another employee, who had also arrived for work, informed the shop-owner.

 After she arrived, all of them went inside, along with the security personnel. They said they found the drawers in which money was kept had been cut open and Rs 1.5 lakh was missing.

 The owner immediately called up Bhowanipore police station and lodged a complaint.

 She had counted the money before closing the shop on Tuesday. The money was gone in the morning, said an officer of the police station.

 A team of policemen questioned the employees but nothing concrete emerged. They went through the closed-circuit camera footage and found the suspect opening the cash register and putting the money inside a polythene bag. He had reported for duty, as usual, on Wednesday morning.

 The man confessed after four hours of interrogation. He said he had been attempting to steal the money for several days. Soon after the store-owner put the cash in the drawers, he took it away, said another officer.

 According to the policeman, the money was in an almirah in the suspects house.

 An incident like this has never happened in the mall. The shops recruit their own staff. They need to be careful while appointing people, said Subir Das, the deputy general manager of Forum.

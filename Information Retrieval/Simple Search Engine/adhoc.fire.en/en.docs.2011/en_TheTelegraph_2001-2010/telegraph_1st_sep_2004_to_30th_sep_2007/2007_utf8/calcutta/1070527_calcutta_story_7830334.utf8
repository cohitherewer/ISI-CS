The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A lady and a bouncer 

 Calcuttan of the Week 

 Who is she? Rupa Das (picture by Bishwarup Dutta)

 Claim to fame: Rupa, 22, has a job that not many women have. The tall, well-built Rupa is employed by Tops Group Security. She is a lady bouncer, as she calls herself, at Underground, the Hotel Hindusthan International nightclub.

 On guard: She is the only woman in a team of four bouncers. She was posted as a bouncer after three years as a security person, says Rupa, who has studied till Class VIII at Surokanya High School in Phoolbagan. But what does a woman bouncer do? The club opens at 7pm. Rupa has to frisk female guests and check purses and belongings for items not allowed in the club gutka and bottles of liquor or water. I also have to speak to women and ask them to settle down if they get disorderly, adds Rupa. 

 Order order: Whats disorderly? If someone starts to break glasses, throw things, or a man misbehaves with a woman. She tries to calm the woman down, while male bouncers take care of the harasser. What happens when they get too disorderly? We speak to them nicely. Then we speak a little more firmly and then ask them to leave, says Rupa, who commutes from Budge Budge to AJC Bose Road and gets dropped back home in the morning.

 Hit list: A group of four women got drunk. We had to drag them out. But they hit me and I fell on one of the cars in the parking lot. I got up and pushed them out of the main gates. This doesnt happen too often, she adds.

 Daily grind: I reach Underground at 6.30pm and stay on till the club closes. Being the only woman in the team does not bother her. Says Md Faiyaz Alam, security head at Underground: We are very happy with Rupas work.

 At home: Rupa lives with her mother. She loves reading Tagore and listens to music.

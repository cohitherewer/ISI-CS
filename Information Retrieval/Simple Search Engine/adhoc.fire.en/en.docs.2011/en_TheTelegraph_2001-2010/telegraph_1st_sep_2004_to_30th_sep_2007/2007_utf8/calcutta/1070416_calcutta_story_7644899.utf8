 Aparajita, 30, and Drishti, 24, (names changed) hail from Bongaon, though Lumbini Park Mental Hospital has been their home for more than a decade.

 Aparajita was admitted to the hospital in 1994. For two years, she lived in isolation. Her family members did not pay her a single visit, until her father decided to get the youngest of her six sisters, Drishti, admitted as a patient. 

 Drishtis only illness was that she had protested the familys abandoning Aparajita.

 It was the last time the two sisters would have seen any of their kin, had not Anjali, an NGO working to get people from mental asylums back to the mainstream, intervened. 

 Last week, the family paid the sisters a visit, promised to come back every month and take them back home within a year.

 The two sisters are of the many who have recovered from mental illness, but are forced to stay on in government hospitals as their families have deserted them.

 But how did the NGO manage the Munna Bhai touch?

 It wasnt easy, said Ratnaboli Ray, founder and managing trustee of Anjali. When we took them to their Bongaon home, the preliminary reaction was of shock. After 11 years, the family had not expected the girls to walk in through the door just like that. They mocked at the girls and practically disowned them, added Ray, who had acquired prior approval of the hospital authorities to take the girls out.

 We then made a film on the sisters experiences. It shows them in conversation with our members and proves that they are as mentally sound as anyone. We threatened the family we would screen the film in their locality and this made them change for the better, Ray told Metro on the occasion of a book release by Anjali.

 The book, Sei Je Baro (The Other Twelve), presents transcripts of the NGOs conversations with 12 inmates of three state-run mental hospitals in and around Calcutta. Some of them have been rehabilitated, while others are still waiting for their families to turn up.

 Mental problems are mostly excluded by mainstream discourses on health. The attitude of the Group D staff and nurses in some hospitals is pathetic, said Anup Dhar, a doctor volunteering with the NGO.

 More than 20 per cent of the beds in government mental hospitals are occupied by patients who could easily be at home, says a survey conducted by Anjali.

 As an asylum cannot help patients beyond a point, the family has to accept the person when he or she is ready to come out into the open. And that acceptance is the final prescription, say experts.

 Five bandhs in two months have crippled the supply of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in the city.

 Dealers and oil companies fear the crisis will continue till February. Four bandhs in December and one in January have led to this situation, an Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) official said on Sunday.

 Irrespective of which party calls a bandh, vehicles carrying LPG cylinders cannot be run. It is risky to operate these vehicles during a bandh because if a mishap occurs, the entire locality will be in danger, he added.

 The official pointed out that there is a backlog of 25 per cent in LPG supply in the city. We are trying hard to tackle the situation, but it will take some time before the supply becomes normal.

 Around 250 trucks each carrying 300 cylinders of IOC, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum enter the city every day. Which means during the five bandh days in December and January, the city was deprived of around four lakh cylinders.

 LPG dealers, however, said there were other problems,too, that had hit the supply. The plants have been hit by some technical problems, causing a drop in supply since Puja 2006, said an official of the LPG Dealers Association (eastern region).

 Hindustan Petroleum dealers alleged that of the three production plants of the company in Paharpur, Dankuni and Haldia, the third was not operational for a long time.

 Closure of the Haldia plant and slow production in Dankuni has mounted pressure on the Paharpur plant, an association member pointed out. Company officials said the Haldia plant reopened in December and things are getting back to normal.

 The situation has come to such a pass that consumers are not getting a refill within a month of booking one.

 The crisis is leading to panic booking, causing the situation to deteriorate further, a dealer said.

 A dealer in south Calcutta said he records 300-350 bookings in a normal day; now, he is recording more than 500 bookings a day.

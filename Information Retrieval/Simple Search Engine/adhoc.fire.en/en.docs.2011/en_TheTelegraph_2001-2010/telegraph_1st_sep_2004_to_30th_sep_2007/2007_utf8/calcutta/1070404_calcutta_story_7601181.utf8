 From a feminine perspective

 Saraswati, the Goddess of knowledge, music and the creative arts, is the inspiration for seven women artists whose works are on show at the ongoing exhibition. Saraswati, A Tribute to Women celebrates womens achievements in the field of art, besides symbolising stree-shakti or woman-power through striking, compelling images. Characterised by different themes and styles, the paintings nevertheless demonstrate the intrinsic beauty and essence of life, both in nature and the human world. They also highlight certain interesting trends in contemporary Indian art, particularly those brought forth by the influence of women artists. Participants: Anita Roy Chowdhury, Geeta Vadhera, Dipali Bhattacharya, Sohini Dhar, Eleena Banik, Piu Sarkar and Saswati Sengupta.

 Event: A exhibition of paintings by seven women artists When: Till April 9; 12 noon - 7 pm Where: Artists Circle, 46 Circus Avenue

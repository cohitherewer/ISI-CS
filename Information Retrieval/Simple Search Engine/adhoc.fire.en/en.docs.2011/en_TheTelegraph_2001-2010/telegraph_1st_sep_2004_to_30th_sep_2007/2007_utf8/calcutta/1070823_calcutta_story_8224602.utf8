 Juvenile law to the rescue of girl help

 RITH BASU 

 Piyali Saha (name changed) is only 13 but has changed schools six times. Every time her aunt would put her into a boarding school, Piyalis mother would take her out and get her employed as a domestic help.

 A provision in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act has now come to the rescue of the girl. Booked under the act, her mother was forced to allow her sister to take care of Piyali till she completes her education.

 Piyalis father died of tuberculosis when she was three. Since then, she had been staying with her mothers elder sister Madhurima Chakraborty (name changed).

 A psychiatrist in Dhanbad with no children, Madhurima had got the girl admitted to Vidyaniketan Residential School in the town.

 Soon after the child turned eight, her mother Chhaya brought her back to Calcutta and made her work for a widower, who lived alone in Champadali.

 The girls wages were paid to Chhaya. Jethu never made me work too hard but he never allowed me to go out to play. I wasnt going to school, either, said Piyali. 

 Madhurima traced the child after a few months and admitted her to Nehru Balika Uchch Vidyalaya in Dhanbad. 

 Once again, Chhaya brought the girl back to Calcutta to work. This went on for a couple of years, until my sister took Piyali out of Narainpur Mission Girls High School, in Birbhum, three years ago, recalled the doctor.

 She next heard of the girl this year: Piyali was working at the same house from where she had been rescued three years ago. When persuasion failed, Madhurimas husband, an employee of the state education department, approached the Juvenile Justice Board. 

 We met criminal advocate Bikash Chatterjee there. He advised us to file a case under Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice Act, said Madhurima. The section states that anyone in charge of a child is liable to imprisonment of up to six months and a fine if he or she is wilfully neglected or caused unnecessary mental or physical suffering.

 The girl was rescued from her employers house on Sunday. Chhaya and the man she was living with were detained. She admitted that she had sold Piyali off when she was six months old for less than Rs 500, said the lawyer.

 According to him, this was the first FIR lodged under the section in the state.

 Madhurima left for Dhanbad with Piyali on Tuesday.

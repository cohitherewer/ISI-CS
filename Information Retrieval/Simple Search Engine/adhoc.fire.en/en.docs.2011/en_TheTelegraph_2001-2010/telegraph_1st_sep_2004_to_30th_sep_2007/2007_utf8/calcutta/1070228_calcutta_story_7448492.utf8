 Meddle cry brings in school monitor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Marian Education Centre, a Christian missionary school in Picnic Garden, has been waiting two years for a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the state government to seek affiliation with the Delhi-based ICSE council. The institution has fulfilled the required criteria, say the school officials. 

 The Claret School in Barrackpore, another Christian missionary school, has been waiting just as long for an NOC. Its administrators, too, claim that the institution has the required infrastructure.

 Flooded with complaints of harassment by government officials during the issuance of NOCs, granting of recognition and funds, 81 founding bodies of Christian missionary schools have decided to form a monitoring panel. 

 The committee will investigate complaints of deprivation of minority rights of Christian missionary schools and, if necessary, take up the issue with the Centre.

 More than a dozen applications for NOCs await the clearance of the state government.

 Officials of the founding bodies said the decision was taken after discussion with the authorities of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) in Delhi last week.

 The demand among parents to educate their children in Christian missionary schools is on the rise not only in the city, but all over the state. We need to open more schools and one of the primary functions of the committee will be to examine complaints from institutions regarding harassment over NOCs, said Father Faustine Brank, president, education cell of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, a forum for the community.

 If we find that the state government is not responding to the committees appeal for speedy issuance of NOCs, we will forward the complaint to the NCMEI, added Brank.

 The NCMEI was set up last year after the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Amendment Act, 2006, was passed in Parliament. 

 The body is authorised to receive and investigate complaints of violation and deprivation of minority rights and take necessary action.

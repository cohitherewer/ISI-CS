The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City realtor ventures out 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 At a time when leading realtors from across the country are choosing Calcutta as a major hub of construction activity, a home-grown developer has ventured out on a pan-India foray, with investments worth Rs 1,500 crore lined up over the next three years.

 The PS Group on Thursday announced an outstation expansion programme, with five shopping malls, 40 million sq ft in the form of townships and residential estates and 10 million sq ft of information technology (IT) space, in the form of IT special economic zones, across six cities. 

 It also unveiled its 100th project, Trinity Plush, a retail-cum-commercial estate on AJC Bose Road.

 We have signed with major international venture capital funds and hence, looking at a strong national presence. This is also a great opportunity to showcase the inherent strengths of Calcuttas real estate sector, while we pick up best practices from others too, said Pradeep Kumar Chopra, director, PS Group.

 Identifying IT as the thrust area, the company has focused on townships close to IT clusters. A major growth nucleus for the group is Chennai, with a 300,000-sq-ft shopping mall at Velecheri, and housing estates on Old Mahabalipuram Road, East Coast Road and in Kelambakkam.

 In Coimbatore, it will construct a 950,000-sq-ft shopping mall near the proposed Infotech City and an 1,100,000-sq-ft condominium complex at the City Centre. An IT special economic zone is planned for Chandigarh on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway.

 The PS Group is also developing an IT-oriented township project at Hinjewadi, next to the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park in Pune, set to become Asias largest IT park. In Jaipur, the company is working on Indias first special education zone in collaboration with the Rajasthan government.

 While the firm underlined that Calcutta would remain the fulcrum of its business, the softer tax regime elsewhere is an obvious incentive. Sanction fees in Chennai are 10 per cent of that in Calcutta, which also levies the highest burden of municipal taxes 40 per cent on residential and 52 per cent on commercial projects.

 The Urban Land Ceiling Act continues to be a major roadblock, and the tedious process of land acquisition in the state remains a damper.

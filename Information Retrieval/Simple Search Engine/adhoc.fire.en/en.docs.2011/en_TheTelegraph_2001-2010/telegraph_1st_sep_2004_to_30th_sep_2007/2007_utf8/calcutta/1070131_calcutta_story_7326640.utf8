 Into the Fire hosted by the Australian High Commission, New Delhi, and the Calcutta School of Music at Birla Sabhagar on Monday marked yet another blurring of boundaries, something we have been seeing a lot of in the cultural scene this season. 

 The performance jointly created by members of the Australian Art Orchestra (AAO) and Sruthi Laya Ensemble was a new and exciting blend of eastern and western music, both classical and jazz. 

 In Australia, we avoid the term fusion. We rather like to see it as an interweaving, said Ann Moir, manager, AAO, Australias premier contemporary music ensemble comprising handpicked jazz musicians who can follow and create notations as well as improvise. 

 AAO came to India for the first time in 1996 when they performed at Siri Fort, New Delhi, then toured Mumbai and Calcutta (Rabindra Sadan). It was through these visits that they realised the importance of binding themselves to the cultural richness of India. They have since been involving themselves in various cultural activities. 

 We have taken Indian artistes to Australia for interactions. Adrian Sherriff, a musician, was a disciple of Carnatic mridangam maestro Guru Karaikudi Mani, explained Moir.

 Sheriff, who was a part of the present performance, went on to start the Sruthi Laya Ensemble in Melbourne. The institute gave extensive training in classical Indian dance and music. Sruthi Laya now has branches in Hyderabad, Chennai and London. 

 Into the Fire presented a host of innovative pieces created by the musicians, western notations keeping pace with the taal and flourishes of the Carnatic tradition. So while Guru Mani played the mridangam, Durga Prasad the gottu vadyam, V. Sureshs ghatam challenged the beats of Niko Schaubles drums and B.V. Balasais flute soared and dipped in lilting melodies with Sandy Evans saxophone, Scott Tinklers trumpet and Sherriffs saxophone. 

 There was also Alister Spence on keyboards, Carl Dewhurst on guitar and Steve Elphick on contra bass. The pieces Madhuram (B.V. Balasai), Into the Fire (Guru Mani), The Creeper (Alister Spence), Charukesi (Adrian Sherriff) and more made for an entertaining evening.

 The initiative, a brainchild of Paul Gravowsky of the AAO, had had a successful run at the Gateway of India, Mumbai, as part of the Mumbai Festival, and at Lalit Kala Thoranam in Hyderabad.

 The show was well received and people came up to say they had never heard of this interesting blend before. We hope to take it to different places because this is something everyone can relate to. This is true world music, said Moir.

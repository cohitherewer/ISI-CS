 Tighter tax noose on added areas

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur merged with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in 1985 will no longer remain a tax haven.

 The accrual system of accounting followed in the city proper (wards 1-100) will soon be introduced in the added areas (wards 101-144), too, said Debotosh Dasgupta, chief of municipal finance and accounts.

 The civic authorities since 1985 have been following a cash-based system of accounting for Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, under which no record is kept for unpaid property tax bills. The accrual system, on the other hand, keeps a detailed record of both payment and non-payment.

 Thanks to the cash-based system, the CMC is not in a position to send demand notices to house-owners defaulting on property tax payment.

 As a consequence, the civic coffers have lost around Rs 2,000 crore in revenue from the added areas in the past 20 years, against an expenditure of Rs 5,000 crore for development of infrastructure in these areas in the same period.

 Once the accrual system is implemented, the defaulting house-owners will get demand notices for the outstanding property tax, along with interest and penalty.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the municipal accounts committee of the CMC has pointed out the anomaly in the tax collection system and the civic accounts department has been asked to take corrective measures.

 The CMC for the first time has constituted a seven-member accounts committee, headed by Atin Ghosh of Trinamul Congress. 

 The other members are Sukumar Sarkar, Moynul Haque Chowdhury, Smita Bakshi, Karuna Sengupta, Nizamuddin Shams and Amita Mukhopadhyay.

 The cash-based system is being followed because of political compulsions, to offer extra privileges to the house-owners of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, said Ghosh.

 However, a wrong accounting system is not the only reason for revenue loss of the civic body from the added areas, pointed out an official. Lack of assessment of new buildings and under-assessment, too, are quite rampant. The authorities are taking steps to reverse the trend.

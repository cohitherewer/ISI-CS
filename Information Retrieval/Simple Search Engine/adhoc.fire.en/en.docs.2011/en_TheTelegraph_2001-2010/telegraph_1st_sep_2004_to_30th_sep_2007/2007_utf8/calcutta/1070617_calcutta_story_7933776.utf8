The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Maithan

 Maithan is not just a reservoir. Its a place where a blue lake with a submerged hillock weaves a dream of tranquillity. The town is just 66 km from Durgapur and 22 km from Asansol at the border of West Bengal and Bihar.

 There are direct buses available from Esplanade. If you go by train, get off at Asansol or Barakar. Buses and Trekkers are available to Maithan from both places. 

 Maithan houses the largest reservoir of the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC). The 15,712 ft long and 165 ft high concrete dam extends over an area of 66 sq km.

 It was constructed on the river Barakar in 1957 and inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. 

 Below the dam there is a hydel power project constructed 135 ft deep inside the hills. It has the capacity to generate 60 MW power. Permission is required from the APRO to visit the project.

 A hillock raises its peak above the water of the lake, which may be visited by a motor launch, arranged by the DVC. While boating in the blue waters of the lake girdled by the hillocks on the three sides, its easy to mistake the vast expanse of the lake for a sea.

 The lake is 120-150 ft deep at places. The DVC charges Rs 10 per person for a 15-minute ride on a motor launch. There is also a deer park and a sanctuary for migratory birds on the other side of the dam.

 Maithan is a perfect retreat to forget the mundane routine of everyday life. The sunset, viewed from the barrage, is an unforgettable experience. 

 The name of the place derives from Mai Ka Than (the abode of the holy mother). There is a 500-year-old temple of the goddess Kalyaneswari on the top of the Hyangla Pahar (hungry mountain) close to the town, which is worth visiting.

 The temple is situated on the Barakar-Dendua bus route that goes via Maithan. It is half a kilometre from the tourists lodge.

 There is a legend that a Hindu king Harigupta, fleeing from the Kushanas in the third century AD, built the capital of his kingdom Salanpur on the top of Hangla Pahar.

 Harigupta is also credited to have built the temple of Kalyaneswari. The deity inside the temple is of Goddess Kali. The king of Panchakot built the present structure of the temple five centuries ago.

 It is believed that human sacrifices were made to the goddess in the past. With the passage of time, ancient Salanpur came to be known as Mayer Than or Mai Ka Than, the place of worship of the mother, and in the course of time Maithan.

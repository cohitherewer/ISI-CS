 Shop robber trail to Patna 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A team of city police officers left for Patna on Sunday to trace the criminals who had robbed a sari shop on Kalakar Street on Saturday afternoon.

 The team, comprising officers of the detective department and Posta police station, is on the trail of three youths who had made bulk purchases from the shop last Wednesday.

 We have found a few leads and it seems we are very close to nabbing them, said a senior officer of Posta thana. 

 Around 3.30pm on Saturday, the three youths walked into the first-floor shop and tried to chat up the employees.

 As they had bought quite a few saris on Wednesday, we tried to entertain them, said an employee of the shop. It was the day of the weekly payment of the sari craftsmen.

 Suddenly, four other youths barged into the shop and held the owners son, Gaurav Rathi, at gunpoint. They spoke amongst themselves in Hindi, with a Bihari accent, recounted the employee.

 The seven men, all in their mid-20s, forced the employees and Rathi into a room and walked away with Rs 3.2 lakh and four mobile phones.

 The police team has the sketches of the criminals, based on the employees descriptions.

 They warned us of a time bomb they had planted outside and we huddled inside the room, said the employee. Eventually, one of the employees went out to inform the cops.

 The gang had information that the weekly payment was made on Saturdays. Their style of reconnaissance shows that they are professional criminals, said a police officer.

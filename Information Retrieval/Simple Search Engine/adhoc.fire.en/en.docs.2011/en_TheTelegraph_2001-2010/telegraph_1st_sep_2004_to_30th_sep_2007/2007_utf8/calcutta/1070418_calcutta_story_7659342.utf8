The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Despair led to death leap

 AMRITA GHOSH

 Acute depression, a sense of insecurity and the fear of failing to feed his family forced 62-year-old Asim Banerjee (not Achintya Banerjee, as reported in Metro on Tuesday) to attempt suicide on Monday.

 Banerjee, a retired employee of a private firm, jumped off Bally bridge into the Hooghly. A few boatmen rescued him and took him to Belghoria police station. We handed him over to his family after giving him first-aid, said an officer of the police station.

 However, Banerjee and his wife and daughter could not be found in their house a single-storeyed building under construction in Mukherjee Lane, Belur, on Tuesday. The house was under lock and key.

 Neighbour Jharna Sengupta said: They left home early in the morning. Perhaps they have taken shelter in a relatives house. Ayan Majumdar, another neighbour, said: An introvert, Banerjee does not mix much with us.

 Some of the neighbours claimed Banerjees wife Ila and daughter Kaushali often insulted him for sitting idle and not earning anything since his retirement 15 years ago.

 His only source of income is a fixed deposit of around Rs 5.75 lakh at Belur post office, which yields a monthly interest of around Rs 3,500, said a source close to the family.

 Banerjee told officers of Belghoria thana on Monday that he had been duped of his house and money by a promoter, Gautam Kumar. The promoter is yet to be questioned.

 He lived with his family in his ancestral house that stood on a 3.5-cottah plot and also owned an adjoining vacant plot measuring two cottahs.

 In December 2005, he sold the house for Rs 9.75 lakh and engaged Kumar to build a home for him on the adjoining plot. He had paid Rs 3.90 lakh to Kumar, who promised to complete the building within six months. 

 Kumar, however, failed to keep his promise. I have almost completed the building. Only water and electricity connections have not been provided. The reason for the delay is the rise in the price of building material, he said. He said Banerjee and his family moved into the house from a rented shelter three months ago.

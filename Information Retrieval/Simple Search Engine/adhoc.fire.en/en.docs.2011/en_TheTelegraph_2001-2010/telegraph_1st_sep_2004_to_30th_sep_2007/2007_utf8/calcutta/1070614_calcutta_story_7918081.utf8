 Bengali handhold

 - Funding for vernacular projects

 SOUMITRA DAS

Detail of picture by Nemai Ghosh

 Nemai Ghosh established himself as a photographer mainly by documenting the work of Satyajit Ray from 1967 right up to the filmmakers death in 1992. Now, he has a collection of 90,000 images, many of which he has published in the form of four books.

 But he does not know what the future holds for the negatives. On his own he finds it impossible to get these digitised and preserved in a temperature-controlled environment. The black-and-whites are yet unchanged but the colour negatives are fading fast, says Ghosh.

 It is this apparently hopeless situation that the Bangalore-based India Foundation for the Arts (IFA) would like to reverse by providing funding, support and incentive so that such unique collections are not lost to posterity. Ever since its inception in 1993, IFA has established a good track record by funding research, archiving and documentation of projects all over the country.

 IFAs latest initiative is reaching out to those who work in the vernacular and are perhaps not smart enough to frame proposals in English. 

 The concentration of IFAs grantees is already in and around Calcutta, and now it has chosen to encourage work in Bengali. IFA will ensure all this valuable material is in the public domain. Wherever possible, Internet access will be ensured.

 Among the grantees working in Bengali are Prabhat Kumar Das, who will write a book on jatra, Sandip Datta, who is archiving Bengali little magazines, and Kamal Saha, who is documenting Bengali theatre.

 Among the interesting projects IFA has supported in 2005-2006 are Tracking Indian Visual Art History, wherein four art historians will identify, edit and annotate critical writing in Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati and Marathi on the visual arts in the first half of the 20th Century; creation of a production on The Hare and Tortoise, combining theatre and shadow puppetry by Adishakti Laboratory for Theatre Art Research, Pondicherry; and creation of a theatre production that will bring to light the suppressed histories of mill workers of Mumbai who lost their jobs after a textile strike in the 1980s.

 One can, however, question IFAs judgment in funding a project to make a non-fiction film based on Hutom Pyanchar Naksa by Kaliprasanna Sinha, the 19th Century Bengali satire which has achieved cult status, and has of late turned into a milch cow for dilettanti of all description.

 Woman at helm of club

 Renu Roy: Good work, good planning and appropriate spirit

 Calcutta is a fortnight away from crowning the first woman president of a social club.

 Renu Roy, who became vice-president of Saturday Club in September 2006, has been proposed as president by the outgoing club committee. Wednesday was the last date for filing of nominations to oppose her candidature and none was forthcoming.

 So, at the clubs AGM on September 19, Renu will be declared its first woman president in 106 years less than two months after Pratibha Patil was sworn in as Indias first President.

 The 56-year-old president-elect will step uncontested into the office of outgoing president A.K. Chatterjee at the 7 Wood Street address.

 I hope to do my best and take the club forward. There are targets to achieve and we hope to work towards them as a team, with good work, good planning and appropriate spirit. I am overwhelmed with the support, said Renu.

 The club as male bastion is clearly crumbling, what with the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) getting its first woman committee member in 175 years last month and Calcutta Club in its centenary year breaking from tradition this April to welcome women as independent members.

 Renus presidentship also marks quite a first for the Association of Presidents of Clubs in Calcutta, a body of 10 leading city clubs founded in 1976.

 Having a lady at the table attending our meetings is something to be proud of. Its a threshold that we are crossing and we happily look forward to more such instances, said association convener Ashwani (Ash) Kapur.

 Will this usher in change or remain a one-off? One can safely assume that other clubs will also start allowing women to participate in the management. Renu Roys election will be a small step for Saturday Club but a giant leap for the citys club fraternity, stressed Kapur.

 Deepankar Nandi, the CEO of the 215-year-old CC amp;FC, agreed that this was a welcome change and since the club had opened up membership to lady members, there was no reason why women will not find a place in the committee in the future.

 Renu has been a prominent figure in the citys cultural circuit as director of a cultural foundation, a film production company, an art gallery and a theatre unit, all under the banner of Spandan.

 Don duo: Helen and 

 Kareena Kapoor

 It was the jugalbandi of a lifetime. Kamini 1978 got together with Kamini 2006 and set the stage on fire. Dancing quuen Helen shared the stage with Kareena Kapoor for a special jig at the 13th Annual STAR Screen Awards, held last Saturday in Mumbai. In what is her first stage performance in more than two decades, Helen showed why old is gold as she danced to Yeh mera dil with Kareena.

 While the Helen-Kareena Don duet was the USP of the evening, there were other great performances punctuating the awards night. Bispasha Basu was on stage again gyrating to Omkaras Beedi and Dhoom:2s Dont touch me.

 Ishaa Koppikar danced to Crazy kiya re besides doing her Aaj ki raat bit from Don.

 Shahid Kapur danced to a medley of tracks from 36 China Town, Chup Chup Ke and Dil Maange More. And then there was a big act Salman Khan jiving to the title tracks of Salaam-e-Ishq and Mujhse Shaadi Karoge.

 There are more reasons to watch the telecast of the awards on Sunday evening at 8 pm on STAR Plus. The Great Indian Laughter Show Champions Raju Srivastava and Naveen Prabhakar were the co-hosts of the evening with Minnisha Lamba and Ishaa Koppikar giving them company. For those in the mood for some live music, there was Sunidhi Chauhan with her package of 11 lively songs.

 REAL FEEL: On the sets of Chorabali.

 The scrub and sand village of Rajasthan and its old forts come alive on the sets of Kaushik Gangulys Chorabali in the middle of a house in Tollygunge. After months of scouring the old forts, the cities and towns of Rajasthan, art director Amit Chatterjee has managed to recreate the look and feel of a typical Rajasthani village replete with a towering red fort, lavish interiors and arched verandahs separated by ornate pillars overlooking a wide patio.

 The pillars have been designed after the ones unique to the Mohangarh fort while the palace carries an overall impression of the forts we visited at Pokhran, Mohangarh and Khejarla, says Amit.

 Antique furniture, satin bolsters and designer cushions on settees kept in different chambers define the drawing and dining rooms. Decorative treasure chests lie in different corners while photo frames, curtains, musical instruments and curio pieces adorn the tables. We collected many of these items from Rajasthan to lend an authentic touch, says Amit, who has been designing sets for telefilms, soaps and ad-films.

 The sets have come alive with Kaushik Ganguly shooting in the brightly-lit haveli, with Sabyasachi Chakraborty panning the camera to a Rajasthani song-and-dance sequence starring Parambrata and Monami encircled by girls dressed in traditional finery.

 After the likes of Ruprekha and Sanchita, another Bengali girl is fighting it out on a small-screen talent hunt. Arunima, who has had a smooth run at Fame X on Sab TV, finds herself in the danger zone this week with friend Sammy. By Friday, only one of them will survive in the academy. 

 On Monday, at the duet theme in the Gala round, Sammy and Arunima sang Hai rama yeh kya hua but failed to impress the judges panel headed by Daler Mehendi. I was thoroughly disappointed, said academy mentor Palash Sen. Sammys performance with Neeti had an impact on the audiences but his performance with Arunima failed to create that magic.

 To know who stays watch the Cafe Round on Wednesday at 9 pm and the Eviction Round this Friday at 10 pm.

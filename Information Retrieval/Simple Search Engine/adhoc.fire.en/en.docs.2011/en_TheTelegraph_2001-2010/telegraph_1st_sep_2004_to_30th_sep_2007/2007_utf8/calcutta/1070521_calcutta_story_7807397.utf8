 Packed summer for students

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The summer will be a whirlwind of activities, from dance workshops to swimming camps, for 18-year-old Issani Paul Chowdhury. For Arina Bardhan, who has appeared for her higher secondary examination, its time to sign up for professional courses.

 Summer is no longer the time students sit back and relax. In fact, the season has never been busier for youngsters.

 From attending workshops on art and music and classes in salsa to short-term computer courses and science camps, there are opportunities galore and the students are grabbing them with both hands. 

 The workshops on self-esteem, toy and puppet-making, terracotta, theatre and various other topics organised at Crossword bookstore from May 18 to June 17 have been booked to capacity. The programmes are meant for those between five and 15 years and cost between Rs 50 and Rs 250.

 This year, I will join a computer class and maybe take tuition for law entrance examinations. I usually spend my holidays tutoring needy children in my area or do some other form of social work, said Arina. 

 Her decision to slog it out during summer has not come as a surprise to her parents. Life is not as slow for them as it was for us. They become career-oriented at a young age. Also, they are aware of the options available, thanks to the media, said Arinas father Arnab Kumar Bardhan.

 But the children are also losing out on the fun that is integral to summer holidays, feels her father. The youth no longer do things just for fun. Everything must have a purpose, said Arnab.

 The practice of going on vacations with parents is also on the wane. I cant remember going out with my parents in the past four years, says Tanmoy Das Lala, a Class XII student of St Xaviers School. 

 Most of my classmates used to go on vacations with parents during middle school. Now, we have studies and other activities and the parents are busier. There are also tuition classes that we cannot afford to miss, added Ishita Chakraborty, a student of Frank Anthony Public School, who has passed her ISC examination this year.

 According to psychologist Atashi Gupta, pressure of studies, professionalism and lifestyle shifts have brought about changes in the way summer holidays are spent.

 The students are more career-oriented now. They are reluctant to do anything that doesnt further their career prospects, said Gupta. The young people prefer to hang out at McDonalds and INOX with friends than go on a trip with parents.

 Some school students are also taking up summer jobs. I will be working at a pathology laboratory this summer. It will help in the pursuit of my dream career, said Tanmoy.

 Ranak Baral, a student of Vivekananda Mission, spent the last two summers working in his uncles ad firm. I am interested in a career in advertising and the summer stints give me a taste of what it involves, said Ranak. 

 For others, working in the cafes and fast food restaurants that have sprung up in the city has become an effective way of earning pocket money.

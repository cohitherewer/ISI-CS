The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Foothold fight at crossroads

 Every evening, thousands

 of people join the battle to catch buses or shuttle taxis

 at some key crossings of the city. It is survival of the fittest here,

 as people chase the vehicles of their choice. As demand far outstrips

 the supply of public transport, madness ensues. The buses and shuttle

 taxis stop just about anywhere and the cops are nowhere to be seen. Metro checks

 out some of the citys danger spots.

 Thousands of people, who come to Calcutta from Howrah on business every day, gather here to board vehicles that will take them back home. At any point between 5pm and 8pm, there are no less than 500 people here. The buses on these routes are few and far between and the long gaps add to the sea of assembled people. 

 When a bus arrives, people rush to board it and many, including women and the elderly, fail to get in and are left stranded. 

 Publicspeak: I have seen people fall and hurt themselves. There should be queues here and the cops should ensure that the buses stop at the stand, says Amit Tiwari, a daily commuter.

 CROSSING

 One of the busiest crossings in the city, where passengers availing of Metro Railway services converge with those taking other transport. People, bound either north or south, take shuttle services from here. 

 There are hundreds of people waiting in front of Haldirams or the Rabindra Sadan Metro station. As soon as the vehicle is in sight, people run to board it. There are three bus stops in the area, but neither the buses nor the passengers use them, while illegal shuttle cars create constant chaos at the crossing. The cops turn a blind eye. 

 Publicspeak: If I wait at the stop, I miss the bus more often than not. So, it is better to wait with the others, said Himika Mukherjee, a resident of Lake Town. 

 Tea Board

 BOARD

 A lot of buses going towards the south suburban localities pass through Brabourne Road. A large part of the crowd comprises office-goers who head to Tea Board to take a bus home. This place becomes one of the busiest thoroughfares in the evenings. To top it all, there are hawkers and thelawallahs. The pavements are so narrow that the crowd spills over on to the busy Brabourne Road. 

 Publicspeak: Pedestrians cannot use the sidewalks because of the hawkers. The vehicles parked along the main road also add to the problems. There is no designated bus stop, so buses stop wherever they see people, said Bharat Tulsyan. 

 Esplanade

 Come evening and the heart of the city chokes up completely. Thousands of people throng Esplanade every evening to avail of transport and as a result, there is a huge assemblage in front of KC Das, Metro cinema, Mayo Road and on Red Road. 

 ESPLANADE

 Traffic sergeants are posted at few intersections. Esplande also being a shopping hub, there are hawkers and vendors who occupy the pavements. 

 Publicspeak: Pavements are for people, not hawkers. There should be a proper bus stand and sergeants allotted to ensure smooth traffic flow, said Pablo Sen, who boards a bus from Esplanade every day.

 Deputy commissionerspeak: We only have 230 sergeants, while there are over a 1,000 crossings in the city. Its difficult to monitor all the crossings with our limited resources, said Manoj Verma, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

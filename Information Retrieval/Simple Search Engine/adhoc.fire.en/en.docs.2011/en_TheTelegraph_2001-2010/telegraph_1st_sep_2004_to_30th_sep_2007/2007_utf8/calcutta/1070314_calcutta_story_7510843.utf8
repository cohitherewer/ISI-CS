The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Union hangs in limbo

 - PRESIDENCY TURMOIL

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Its been a fortnight since the students union polls were held in Presidency College, but tension is still prevailing on campus over formation of the students body.

 It has not helped that the authorities have not decided on a demand by the Students Federation of India (SFI) for re-election in two postgraduate seats.

 Six students of the college were detained on Monday night after a clash between supporters of the SFI and Independent Consolidation (IC), which won the election, in front of Hindu Hostel.

 Principal Mamata Roy has gone on leave for an indefinite period due to illness. She has handed over the responsibility to head of the economics department Amitava Chatterjee. He, too, went on leave on Monday, aggravating the crisis.

 Worried over the situation, the state government on Tuesday contacted senior officials of the college to resolve the stalemate. The college is under the control of the state higher education department.

 Though the government controls the college, it has a governing body that tackles internal problems. We hope the authorities will be able to arrive at a solution soon. The government will have to intervene if the matter is not sorted out quickly, said state director of public instruction Subhankar Sarkar.

 Immediately after SFI approached the authorities with their demand for re-election, the college governing body set up a committee to probe allegations that the IC had adopted unfair means. 

 According to college officials, the governing body has taken a resolution, not yet revealed, on the basis of the probe report. 

 A teacher, who is also a member of the All-Bengal Government College Teachers Association, said it is high time for the government to intervene.

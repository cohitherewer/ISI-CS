 Grey shades of life

 Both his grandfathers being passionate photographers, Anikendra Ghosh spent his childhood in an extraordinary environment, surrounded by numerous black-and-white portraits of his family members. Yet, from a very tender age, he was also aware of the fact that the two stark colours encompassed in them many more shades of significance than what was apparent. To be inaugurated this evening at 6.30 pm, the exhibition of his photographs in black-and-white reflects a sense of solitude or melancholia in some form or other. Though confessing that he did not choose his medium by design, the artist has admitted that he prefers to freeze moments from life in shades of grey rather than in colour. Portraying serene, mellow and peaceful images of nature, his works evoke an uncanny silence and stillness, echoing the futility and emptiness of life and the world in which we live.

 Event: Photographs by Anikendra Ghosh When: Till August 5; 11 am - 7 pm Where: The Art Gallery, ITC Hotels the Sonar, Kolkata

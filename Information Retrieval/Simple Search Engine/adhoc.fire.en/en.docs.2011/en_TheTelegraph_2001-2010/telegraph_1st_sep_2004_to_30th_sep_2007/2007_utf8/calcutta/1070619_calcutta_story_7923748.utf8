The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Japan eyes stronger ties with the city

 - Envoys third stint

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 He was sent to study Bengali at Visva-Bharati and Jadavpur University (JU) by the Japanese Foreign Service in the early 1970s, and served as vice-consul in charge of information and culture in the city consulate between 1974 and 76.

 Back in Calcutta for a third stint after three decades, this time as Japanese consul-general, Motoyoshi Noro has a mission: To strengthen political, economic and cultural ties with Bengal, while leveraging the metros geographical advantage.

 My primary objective is to ensure that all high-level political delegations from Japan include Calcutta on their itinerary and not just visit Delhi and Mumbai. Its also important to invite Japanese business captains to come and see for themselves the changes sweeping Bengals investment climate, Noro tells Metro.

 The diplomat, who speaks olpo olpo Bengali and has served in the subcontinent for 15 years, feels Calcutta is on the threshold of something big. Before World War II, there were more than 2,000 Japanese businessmen in Calcutta and it was a more important mission than New York. Although we have less than 150 Japanese nationals residing here now, things are going to change soon, he stresses.

 Infrastructure remains a problem area and a comprehensive plan linking roads, railways and sea port is the need of the hour, feels the consul-general. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is already doing the feasibility study for the proposed East-West Metro. And I have requested the chief minister to convince Air-India to fly Calcutta-Tokyo direct, said Noro.

 Culture and education are the other focus areas, with Calcutta set to host the countrys first Indo-Japanese cultural centre, to be inaugurated on August 8 in Salt Lake.

 Powered by a $1-million grant from the Sasakawa Nippon Foundation, JU is already sending research students to Waseda University in Tokyo, while 20 Japanese students are studying English in Rabindra Bharati University.

 Human resources has always been Calcuttas strong point and student exchange can only get busier, says Noro.

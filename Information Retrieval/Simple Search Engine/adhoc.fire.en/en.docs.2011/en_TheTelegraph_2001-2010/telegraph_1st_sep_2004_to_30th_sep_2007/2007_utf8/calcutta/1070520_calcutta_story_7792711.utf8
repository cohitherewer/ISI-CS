 Mother Teresas all

 Experiencing poverty in Sudder Street is a Western luxury, says an English tourist 

 Inside Out 

 I want to experience what poverty is like. This is how one Sudder Street resident justified it. It is a strange but powerful phenomenon and one that Sudder Street caters to perfectly. It must take a strong will to maintain guest houses in such squalor. 

 They are not alone. Commendable also are the taxi-drivers who pass up the opportunity of an honest fare and wait with the patience of Job for a Rs 100 half-kilometre sucker. Lets not forget the array of beggars and hawkers who work so hard lest we forget for a moment that we are living among the poor. These all are purveyors of a fine fantasy, a five-star experience of poverty. 

 A week, a month, six months among the denizens of Sudder Street and we can go home, like the prodigal son, to our fatted calves. To take the analogy further, the prodigal sons brother stayed at home, worked tirelessly for his father and was never allowed so much as a young goat to celebrate with his friends. So too our brethren in London or Tokyo cannot afford to live there so profligately. Experience poverty? It could not be further from the truth. There are few places in the world where a Western tourist is richer than in Calcutta. 

 The analogy with the prodigal son, though, is flawed: he spent his inheritance and, poverty-stricken, was forced to work as a pig-herder, the lowliest of labourers. He did experience poverty and when he returned home, it was not with smug self-satisfaction that he had done so but with the words: Father I have sinned against God and against you. I wonder how many middle class Western tourists would be happy to return home from Sudder Street to work as unskilled labourers. 

 It is a powerful phenomenon and especially among the hippy and the volunteer communities. The phenomenon is simply this: that so many wish to live in utter squalor when for comparatively little more and by that I mean less than a single journey on the London Underground they could stay in a clean air-conditioned room with private bathroom in a similarly central location. The Sudder Street hostels provide a kind of community where residents can swap stories of Dharamsala highs and human misery. Price also is a factor although it is the difference between cheap and dirt cheap. But ultimately, and often secretly, the attraction is not that it is dirt cheap but that you get dirt and you get it cheap. 

 This is the expectation, the perverse image of Calcutta, a sordid slum where we can all minister magnanimously, Mother Teresas all. We can write home with vivid descriptions of the rickshaw driver who clatters his bell, flashing a toothless smile; of half-naked brats smiling and running: How are you! How are you! while their younger siblings piss in the gutters where rats frolic; of ragged beggars who proffer a crippled limb and ask for Rs 100. These are the expectations to which Sudder Street caters, the progeny of heart-wrenching documentaries and romantic travel journalism. 

 These expectations exert a powerful force. Returning to Calcutta after eight years, much has changed, but the black holes of Sudder Street have not changed at all. And yet I find myself there, leaving my sweat like a sacred offering on these same mattresses. I have decided to move to a better hotel, a little more expensive but clean, cool and comfortable. And yet, and yet, somehow I feel ashamed of myself.

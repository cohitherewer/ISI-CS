 A Druk Air flight from Paro and a Kingfisher flight from Mumbai had to be sent back, while Air-Indias Haj flight from Jeddah was diverted to Nagpur. IndiGo flights from Delhi and Mumbai were diverted to Guwahati, as were Indians Mumbai and Bangalore flights. All landed in Calcutta later in the day.

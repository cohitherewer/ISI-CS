 Civic plan for footpath upkeep

 - 21 important roads shortlisted under new scheme

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic authorities have chalked out a scheme to maintain the pavements on 21 important roads in the city. Under the programme, named Project Footpath, the earmarked pavements will be supervised directly by senior officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya mooted the proposal, which was unanimously passed by the mayoral council in a meeting on Friday.

 There are 1,650 km of roads and 2,000 km of pavements in the city. About 500 km of pavements will be covered under Project Footpath. The civil engineering department of the CMC has shortlisted the pavements in north, central and south Calcutta (see box).

 The executive engineers of the boroughs will be responsible for the upkeep of the shortlisted pavements in their area, explained municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 According to him, the engineers will have to ensure that there are no potholes, ditches or encroachments on the footpaths and that they are properly lit. If a public or private utility service provider digs up a pavement, then it will also have to restore it to the original state within 48 hours of the completion of the work. 

 The engineers will have to prepare a list of encroachments on the pavements. If necessary, videotapes of the pavements will be preserved for reference, said commissioner Bandyopadhyay.

 The primary objective of Project Footpath is to keep selected pavements under constant focus of the highest level of civic authorities and to offer a free walk for pedestrians, said the mayor. He cited the examples of Amsterdam and London to underscore the need for the scheme in the city. 

 Project Footpath will continue along with the CMCs Adopt A Pavement scheme, said the municipal commissioner. The earlier programme allows business houses to maintain and beautify chosen pavements. 

 We have received expressions of interest from a dozen business houses and entrepreneurs for pavements on Elgin Road, Gurusaday Road, Loudon Street, Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani and some other roads, said Bandyopadhyay.

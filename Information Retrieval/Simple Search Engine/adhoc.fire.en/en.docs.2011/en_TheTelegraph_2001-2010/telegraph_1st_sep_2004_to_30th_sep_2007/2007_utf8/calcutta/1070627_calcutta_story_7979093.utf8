 Womans body found floating

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 32-year-old housewife was found floating in Rabindra Sarobar by morning-walkers on Tuesday. Police said Neena Mondal was suffering from depression. She had attempted suicide five days ago.

 Neena stayed in Dover Terrace, in the Gariahat area, with her husband Ajay. No suicide note was found. 

 The body was found near the lily pool around 6.30am, said police officers. Neena was taken to MR Bangur Hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead.

 The deputy commissioner of police (south), Ajoy Kumar, said no evidence of foul play has been found. The body has been sent for post-mortem. We cannot say anything before we get the report.

 The police stations around Rabindra Sarobar were asked to go though missing complaints to establish Neenas identity.

 Around this time, Ajay lodged a missing diary with Gariahat police station after finding his wife missing from their home. After being informed, he rushed to the hospital and identified the body.

 Ajay told the police that Neena had been suffering from depression. Last Friday morning, she had left home before Ajay woke up. She went to Rabindra Sarobar and jumped in but was rescued by the people around. They took her to hospital, from where she was discharged after treatment. 

 The investigating officers said they would question Ajay, if necessary, after receiving the post-mortem report. We will see if she was under medication and will talk to the doctor who used to treat her regularly. We have registered a case of suicide, said an officer.

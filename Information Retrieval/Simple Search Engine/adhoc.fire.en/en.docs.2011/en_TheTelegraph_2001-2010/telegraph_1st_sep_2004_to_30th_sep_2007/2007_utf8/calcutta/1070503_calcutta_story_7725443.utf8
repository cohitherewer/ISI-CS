 Tirade over upgrade

 - KERALA, BENGAL ECHO RESERVATIONS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The West Bengal and Kerala governments have joined hands to retain control over two tech schools Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) and Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) which the Centre is considering for upgrade to Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology (IIEST). 

 Reasonable representation of students from the states, participation of the state governments in the administrative council and recurring grants for these two institutions the Left-ruled states are chorusing on their demands before handing over the control of the institutes to the ministry of human resources development (HRD). 

 How can there be a handover without even a discussion on these issues? asked state higher education minister Sudarshan Roy Chaudhuri, echoing the concerns raised by his Kerala counterpart, M.A. Baby. In a letter, written on April 24, Roy Chaudhuri has sought an appointment with Union HRD minister Arjun Singh to discuss the issues. 

 While the Centre wants complete freedom from state control for these two institutes, the Kerala government, along with the West Bengal government, will suggest an alternative model for IIEST. 

 In a letter to state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb on April 4, the HRD ministry secretary clearly spelt out the Centres demand, which is in line with the central guideline. 

 But the missive from Delhi has miffed the Writers Buildings bosses. I had written to Arjun Singh earlier, the chief minister had written to the Prime Minister regarding the upgrade, but there was no response. Instead, there is a secretary-level letter asking the government to hand over the institute, said Roy Chaudhuri. 

 The higher education minister met the members of the teachers union last week and explained the position of the state government on the upgrade issue. 

 But the Besu teachers association (Besuta) is not in agreement with the minister. 

 Besu has never had any reservations or quotas in all the years that it has been under the state government. Why is the government insisting on a reservation now? asked Manas Hira, Besuta member.

 On the issue of mode of governance for IIEST, the teachers prefer the model that the Centre wants to follow over the one suggested by the state government.

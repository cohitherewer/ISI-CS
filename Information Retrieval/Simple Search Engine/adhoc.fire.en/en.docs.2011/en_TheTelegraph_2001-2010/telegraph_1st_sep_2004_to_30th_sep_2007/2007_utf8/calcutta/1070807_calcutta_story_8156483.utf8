 Art from the orient

 Vietnamese art reflects a mixture of diverse influences: Vietnamese traditional art, influences from China and influence of French art during colonial times. Since as far back as the 3rd or 4th century BC, Vietnamese master craftsmen and artists have mastered techniques of lacquer painting, a unique style of painting where artists use hot lacquer to draw the outline of a picture after which colours are applied one by one, layer upon layer. Contemporary art of Vietnam also includes paintings done in oil, silk or gouache. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by four artists from Vietnam features works with depth and a touch of freshness where East meets West. Their art appears familiar and at the same time exotic, with a touch of Eastern mysticism. Among them, Do Duy Tuan, in town for the show, will paint live at the exhibition venue till August 8. One of the most talented artists in Vietnam today and a profound Zen thinker, he mostly paints feminine figures, portraying his subjects in sombre and dreamlike moods, using mixed media as his material.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by artists from Vietnam When: Till August 12; 3 pm - 6 pm Where: By The Way, Taj Bengal

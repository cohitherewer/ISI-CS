 Dilemma over dogs

 - Stray canine count belies NGO claim

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The mayor is foxed over dogs.

 What he finds most intriguing is the contradiction between the citys stray canine population, as revealed in the census, and the number of dogs the NGOs claim they sterilise every year.

 According to the 2006 census, there are 35,668 stray dogs in the city, of which 17,882 are bitches. But the figure should have been much lower if the NGOs claim that they sterilise 13,000 dogs a year is true.

 The discrepancy has prompted mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya to ask the civic chief municipal health officer (CMOH) to tone up the monitoring of the NGOs and crack the whip on the non-performing dog squad.

 Bhattacharyya wanted to know why the squad, which is supposed to catch stray dogs and hand them over to NGOs for sterilisation, has virtually stopped functioning.

 There have been instances of the squad passing on complaints about stray dogs to NGOs, instead of acting on them. This practice must stop, the mayor said at the meeting.

 But why is the dog population increasing, despite the massive sterilisation drive? Experts say either the census report is wrong or the NGOs are giving bloated figures.

 Sushmita Roy, of Love-N-Care for Animals, said: Our organisation sterilises 3,600 dogs a year. We are sceptical about the claims of others that they sterilise 9,000 to 10,000 dogs a year.

 Debasish Chakraborty, of People For Animals, feels the actual dog population is much lower than what the census says. The report is bogus.

 He also pointed out that the dog squad is ill-equipped to catch the animals. In 1998, the squad had six vehicles and 19 field men. Now, it has only two vehicles and six men.

 CMOH Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay feels the stray dog count cannot be controlled if sterilisation continues at the present rate.

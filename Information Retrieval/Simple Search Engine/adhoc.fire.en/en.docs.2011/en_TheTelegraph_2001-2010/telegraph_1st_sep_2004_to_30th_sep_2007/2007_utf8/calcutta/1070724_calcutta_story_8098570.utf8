 Golf goes to school

 - Tee-off option targets 10,000 students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 For parents eager to see their child become a Tiger Woods or a Michelle Wee, theres now a tee-off option at school.

 A sustained coaching programme, customised to suit sports budgets of various schools in Calcutta, aims to reach out to 10,000 kids keen to hit golf balls, with start-up lessons and structured follow-through.

 We are tying up with 10 city schools to begin with, doing quarterly talent-spot clinics for five-year-olds and above. The target is to have at least 300 first-timers join the programme in the first year, says Indrajit Bhalotia, chief coach of Protouch, the academy, that is taking golf to city schools.

 The fastest-growing urban sport in India is now an acceptable career option, with Ashok Kumar, the winner of this years Indian PGA tour, making Rs 35 lakh. Its also an individual sport played by CEOs and MDs of blue chips and is regarded as a potent networking tool.

 We are impressing upon school authorities the various career options golf has to offer. For those who dont have it in them to be part of the Rs 6-crore prize money pro tour, there are lucrative downstream careers in event management, coaching, merchandising, green-keeping, retailing, course designing and equipment repairing, says Bhalotia, who is helped by Basad Ali, Abhishek Ghosh and nine other coaches.

 The schools programme, supported by golf gear major TaylorMade, offers two different schemes. For schools like La Martiniere and St Xaviers, which have space, the programme can install a golf simulator, create a putting green and astroturf mats, besides providing full-time coaches.

 For institutions, which dont have space on campus and might be having a lower sports budget, the Protouch-TaylorMade programme will offer subsidised weekly or monthly clinics at Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) and Tollygunge Club, with talent-spotting and subsidised equipment.

 City schools have responded to the books-n-birdie overture with a strong approach shot. We already have around 20 children playing golf, and most of their fathers are members of RCGC or Tolly. There are many more who would love to play, but dont have access to a course. This scheme will provide them the opportunity to get started, says Abdul Samad, games teacher of Calcutta International School.

 The start-up cost will vary from Rs 400 to Rs 1,000 a month, depending on the programme the school has chosen. If the response is good and more schools join the fray, Protouch will take school kids to the Maidan, through a tieup with the Calcutta Ladies Golf Club, to create more training space.

 We are looking to develop the talent base of golf in India and supporting junior talent is our priority, says a TaylorMade spokesperson. The company, which powers the likes of Sergio Garcia and Retief Goosen, will also provide demo equipment and balls for students to practise with.

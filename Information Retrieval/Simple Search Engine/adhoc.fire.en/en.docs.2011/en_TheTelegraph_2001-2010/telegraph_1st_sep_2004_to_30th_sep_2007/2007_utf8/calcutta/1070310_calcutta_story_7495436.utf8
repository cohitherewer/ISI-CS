 Coffee House runs dry

 WATER WOES: Coffee House on College Street. A Telegraph picture

In a crackdown on property tax defaulters, the civic body on Friday snapped water connection to a building on Bankim Chatterjee Street, without knowing that it houses the famous Indian Coffee House.

 Supply to the heritage eatery, however, was restored soon after the civic authorities discovered that it occupies the first and second floors of the building. The rest of the building is still without water.

 Sources in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) blamed the confusion on the failure of the Coffee House authorities to mutate the property in their name.

 CMCs assessor amp; collector (north) Bhaskar Bhattacharya said the building is still recorded in the assessment register as Bhabi Property, though the state government had acquired the Coffee House floors in 1996 in favour of the Indian Coffee Workers Cooperative Society Limited.

 The Society has been asked to immediately apply for mutation of the two floors and apportionment of liability, said an official.

 The total property tax due from the building one-sixth owned by the Society is Rs 36 lakh.

 The CMC has prepared a list of 108 defaulters and the amount due from them is Rs 50 crore. Individual dues vary from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.

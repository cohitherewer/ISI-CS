The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 South set for road upgrade

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 To keep pace with the southward growth of east Calcutta, the civic body has rolled out a Rs 5.5-crore road infrastructure development plan for Nayabad, Srinagar (New Garia) and Baishnabghata-Patuli.

 The schemes include laying a 1.5-km road that will connect the areas with the EM Bypass and the airport, widening of existing roads and construction of pavements.

 The real estate boom along the EM Bypass is moving south and the civic body must take timely measures to sustain the surge by providing the necessary infrastructure, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 According to Calcutta Municipal Corporation officials, more than two lakh people will benefit from the road upgrade schemes. Civic deputy chief engineer (civil) Soumitra Bhattacharya said road-widening projects in Nayabad and Baishnabghata-Patuli have started and work on the link road connecting Nayabad with the EM Bypass, via Mukundapur, will be taken up after Puja 2007.

 The road will be 20 metres wide and flanked by broad pavements. The project cost has been pegged at Rs 3.5 crore.

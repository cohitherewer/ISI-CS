 P.C. Sorcar Junior is developing a module on magic for the Masters degree drama course at Rabindra Bharati University (RBU). A paper on magic may also be introduced in the graduation course on the subject.

 The module, titled Dramagic, will combine the sciences, the arts and psychology. Magic is used everywhere but has not been institutionalised. If we dont conserve the ancient magic forms, they will be lost, said Sorcar.

 For RBU, the module will make the drama programme more dynamic. Magic has existed as an essential element of folk and traditional theatre in south-east Asia for many years. Magic is being used in modern theatre too. We are keen on adding magic to the drama course as a specialised sub-group alongside direction, videography, acting, playwriting and production designing, said Somnath Sinha, the head of the drama department at the university.

 We will organise workshops and seminars with scholars to discuss the syllabus and methodology in order to introduce the module on magic next year, he added.

 The study of magic will cover the technical side, history, literature and drama. There will be both theoretical and practical lessons.

 Sorcar has classified magic into 13 parts. Illusions range from traditional to modern forms like penetration, floatation, transportation and animation, which require experts, said Sorcar.

 The magician plans to bring specialists from across the world to help the students develop their skills. Street magicians will also be drafted in to teach the module.

 Sorcar wants to hold the classes at his homes in Calcutta and Baruipur to maintain privacy. The decision has not been taken yet.

 Sorcar is exploring the possibility of hosting short courses for children between classes III and V at home to make them aware of superstitions and false beliefs.

 Water, 

 a blessing

 Screen On amp; Off

 Fingers crossed for the Best Foreign

 What 

 was your first reaction when you heard Water has 

 got an Oscar nomination?

 I was really excited, very happy, 

 of course. To be honest I was pleasantly surprised. Its 

 not that I had any doubt about the quality of the film. 

 But I tend not to overestimate a film if I am in it.

 What do you think swung things 

 in Waters favour?

 It is a universal human story. 

 It may show widows but it is about lonely women everywhere. 

 In terms of background and traditions, it is very Indian. 

 But then every corner of the world has its own rituals and 

 customs. (Akira) Kurosawas films also had this very regional 

 quality about them. But then Water is not only about 

 the subject. Deepas treatment makes the film go beyond 

 the script.

 Did it ever bother you that 

 you were Deepas second choice after she couldnt make Water 

 with Shabana Azmi playing your character?

 I never compare my new role with 

 any of my previous roles or myself with someone else. It 

 doesnt matter to me whether the person considered before 

 me was greater or smaller than me. When Deepa offered me 

 the role of Shakuntala, I just asked her: Can I see the 

 script? She sent it to me and, after reading it, I liked 

 my role. I could relate to the character. I could see the 

 whole film in front of my eyes.

 How did you read your character 

 Shakuntala?

 Shakuntala is a very silent character. 

 The thinking, the feeling, the suffering, everything is 

 there but it comes out through her work, not her words. 

 Her motto is karo, bolo nahin. She has a very 

 literal face, if I could put it that way. Even when she 

 helps Kalyani (Lisa Ray), she does it very silently. Almost 

 in a telepathic language. Then, of course, she takes the 

 little girl Chuiya out of all her troubles.

 I have this habit of doing a background 

 story of my character, just for my reference. For Shakuntala, 

 I felt she didnt want to get married that early and wanted 

 to study. Gandhi was her inspiration. But she was forced 

 into marriage and all her dreams remained unfulfilled. So, 

 only after she becomes a widow does she feel that she is 

 finally an independent woman. Her father and husband can 

 no longer dictate terms to her. Her only wish is that her 

 next generation shouldnt suffer like her. She believes 

 that she will do something whenever she gets a chance.

 Kids and animals are generally 

 considered difficult to work with. How was young Sarala 

 on the sets?

 Oh, Sarala is a very talented 

 girl! She is a born artiste. She learnt Hindi and English 

 in just a few weeks. She used to behave like a star on the 

 sets (laughs). I am sure she will grow up to be a 

 professional actress. Water was a wonderful experience 

 for her and everyone on the sets with her.

 And how was the Deepa Mehta 

 experience?

 It was the experience of a lifetime. 

 I consider myself lucky to have got a chance to work with 

 Deepa. She is not only a great director, she is a great 

 human being. Water was a blessing for me. I enjoyed 

 working on the film creatively. It was just the way I want 

 to work. She gave me that chance and that liberty. She loves 

 her actors like children.

 Will it be right to say that 

 you were underutilised after Bandit Queen?

 Honestly, Bandit Queen was 

 my first role as an actress in a film. My dream was to play 

 a role with lots of shades, show my wide range as an actress. 

 I always wanted to do Hollywood standard of acting (laughs), 

 you know, the effortless kind. So while I was living with 

 that dream in NSD, I got Bandit Queen. I said: Thank 

 you God, you have heard me.

 I did have doubts with a couple 

 of scenes because of nudity and I told the director (Shekhar 

 Kapur) that. He said that truth is always ugly and we should 

 show the reality. But I said that I could not portray it 

 myself. So they used a double for those scenes. Bandit 

 Queen, however, was the role of a lifetime. What was 

 sad that the film became famous for the controversies, not 

 for my performance or for the quality of the film. It was 

 my first film and I considered it to be my last. Through 

 the film I was looking for myself and I found her.

 Would you consider Water 

 your comeback, having won the Genie Award (Canadian 

 Oscars) for Best Actress?

 Only after I finished shooting 

 the film did I realise what we had done. Still, I never 

 quite expected the international acclaim it has received. 

 I remember walking on the red carpet at the Toronto Film 

 Festival. That was my first time at an international festival. 

 Then when I watched the film inside, I got so scared. I 

 kept thinking why I did that in this way and not that way. 

 But everybody was busy praising the film and had no idea 

 what I was thinking. Deepa is so sensitive she came and 

 consoled me. You dont know what you have done, she said. 

 As for the Genie Award, I got to know from a friend. I was 

 shooting in south India at the time. When I heard it, I 

 just started crying. Thank God. Thank God.

 Will Water go on to 

 win the Oscar?

 Like always, I dont expect anything 

 but I have my fingers crossed.

 City Lights

 Zen moves, moved by art

 Ganesh Haloi translates his contemplations on nature in visual terms. Sun Ock Lee, foremost exponent of Korean traditional and modern dance, was so inspired by his serene paintings that she held a performance of Zen dance at Akar Prakar gallery and moved on to the patch of green outside on Friday evening.

 Trained at New York University, she was here to conduct a workshop for Padatik. It took her two hours to don her exquisite paper costume with its long layered white scarves and skirt.

 She swayed to the sombre sound of a Korean flute. This was happening when the entire area was plunged in darkness, thanks to loadshedding. She seemed like a bird in flight. But somehow her movements were not in sync with the Indian classical music that followed.

 Light and shadow

 Old-fashioned watercolours are transparent, and the best of these have an ethereal quality. Tapas Kanti Mitra, whose exhibition has opened at Gallery Katayun, is an accomplished watercolourist, best at evoking the stillness that pervades the markets, alleys and old buildings of north Calcutta.

 He captures with perfection the play of light and shadow on the walls of old buildings with their balconies and terraces, and the tangle of electrical wires on which crows still hold their meetings. There is a particularly beautiful one, where the dark shed of a market leads to a bright sunlight area beyond. In some of these, rickshaws feature quite prominently. Rows of these vehicles form a phalanx on one road a familiar sight in Calcutta.

 Mitra has also done a series of landscapes sea beaches, mountains and rivers. In many of these dark, lowering clouds dominate the space. But it is the townscapes that remain in mind.

 The genius way

Everyone is a genius, believes Raksha Bharadia (in picture). Only, the genius stays layered by limitations. It is to access the genius within that Raksha has written a self-help book called Me.

 The book, into the third imprint, takes the help of cartoons, quotations of famous names from the past and anecdotes narrated by people Raksha has interviewed to reason with the reader.

 I am telling my readers to be honest, says the 35-year-old, pointing out the USP of her book in a market full of self-help books. It also provides an interactive section whereby readers have to delve into their personal strengths and weaknesses to come up with answers.

 Based in Ahmedabad, Raksha was born and brought up in Calcutta. Now delivering talks around the city, she points out that while sleep debt, junk food and stress are common problems, men feel guilty in taking a break. They douse tiredness in coffee.

 Life is becoming competitive and people taking every route to be the best. Me, she says, is one such.

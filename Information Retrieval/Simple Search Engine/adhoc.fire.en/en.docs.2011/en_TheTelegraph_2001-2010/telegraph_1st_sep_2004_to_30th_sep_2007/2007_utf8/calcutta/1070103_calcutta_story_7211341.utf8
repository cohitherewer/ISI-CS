 Wider roads and flyovers on the anvil 

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has lined up a number of projects to widen or expand roads and flyovers.

 The decisions were taken at a recent meeting attended by urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and other senior officers of the CMDA, including chief executive P.R. Baviskar. Most of the projects will start in January and we will see to it that they are wrapped up at the earliest, said a senior CMDA official.

 Special emphasis, he added, will be on the IT hub in Salt Lake Sector V, so the professionals have a hassle-free journey to and from the airport. One of the projects to revamp the Sector V infrastructure is the extension of the flyover at the entrance to Salt Lake from Chingrihata up to Nicco Park.

 Another is the widening of the Parama Island-Ruby Park road from four to six lanes. According to the proposal, the road will be extended up to Kamalgazi, in Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, and then to Baruipur, where the district headquarters of South 24-Parganas will be shifted. It may take some time to start the project, as quite a few trees need to be felled, the official pointed out.

 The project we are all looking forward to is the Prince Anwar Shah Road-EM Bypass connector. Once it is opened, people from Behala and Thakurpukur will reach the airport very quickly, said Debdas Bhattacharya, chief engineer, CMDA.

 Work on the connector is now progressing satisfactorily, Bhattacharya added. It started in 1993 but got delayed because of several reasons, resulting in an escalation of the project cost.

 The department also has plans to construct a flyover on Raja SC Mullick Road to enable residents of South City High to reach the airport quickly via the Bypass.

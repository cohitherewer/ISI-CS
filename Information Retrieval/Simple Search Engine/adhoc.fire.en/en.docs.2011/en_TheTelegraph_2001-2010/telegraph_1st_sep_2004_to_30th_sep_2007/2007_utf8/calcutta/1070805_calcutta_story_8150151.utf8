The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at... 

Mandarmoni

 The name Mandarmoni doesnt conjure up images of a wonderful getaway. But it is a fascinating place where a lush green landscape meets a vast stretch of virgin beach. 

 To get there, keep in mind the important but difficult-to-remember name of Chawalkhola. That is where you turn left from Calcutta-Digha expressway into a bumpy road.

 The transition from the rather rough road to the smooth wet beach is sort of indicative of better things to come. The six-km drive on the beach is one youd wish would never end. The beach is almost deserted, the air is clear and the view mindblowing.

 Our resort was not difficult to find. It announced itself through a riot of coloured flags. Thankfully so, as the beach is lined with numerous resorts in various stages of development. The first things I noticed while entering the resort was terracotta figures. Some life size, almost hidden behind a dense lining of casuarina trees, the others on display in the large reception area.

 The artist sat in front of the resort transforming clay into beautiful pieces of art. My kids refused to proceed further till they picked up a few tips on clay modelling. It was an ideal alternative to a summer camp. 

 The sights and sounds of Mandarmoni get etched in ones mind. Be it of millions of red crabs running wild on the beach or numerous birds that sing happily in the trees or frogs of different shapes and sizes or brilliant sunsets that make you wish you had a better camera. The resort also had swans, which kept the children occupied for hours. The visit was like one big nature study trip for them. 

 The gracious service, spacious rooms and mouthwatering food made the stay very pleasant. For those who just wanted to relax, there were several hammocks that lulled me into blissful sleep. 

 To sit around and admire the sea, there were brightly-coloured deck chairs and huge garden umbrellas. The sea though is just too inviting to be only watched. It is neither very deep nor rough.

 Fresh coconut water is most refreshing after a dip in the sea. I couldnt decide whether it was the exercise of swimming or the excellent cooking that increased my appetite.

 Going 

 Shalimar-Digha Express can be taken from Shalimar or Santragachhi from Monday to Saturday. On Sunday, the train leaves from Howrah. Get down at Kanthi. Vehicles are available from there to Mandarmoni. 

 Buses are available from Esplanade or Howrah. Get down at Kanthi Roadways stop. Then hire a vehicle to the beach resort. If you go by car, take Calcutta-Digha expressway. Turn left from Chawalkhola.

 Staying 

 There are several hotels at Mandarmoni. The tariff varies from Rs 500 to Rs 4,000 per night. It is best to book in advance.

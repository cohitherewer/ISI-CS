 City chronicle

 Set against the backdrop of Varanasi, Kashinama tells a poignant tale of conflict between fanaticism and culture. The ancient city, formerly known as Kashi, has stood witness to the ageless, faceless tableaux of civilizations over centuries. The play takes the audience on a metaphorical journey of the city over the last few decades, exposing the reality of the changes that took place behind the veil of socio-economic progress. Its protagonist is the temple-city that has long suffered in the name of religion. It becomes a symbol of the country on one hand and epitomises the hypocrisy and dishonesty of religious ambassadors on the other. A telling exposure of the contemporary national scenario, the play ends with a disturbing question: whether the forces of globalisation and the spirit of ancient India, as propagated by its advocates, are in conflict or, whether they actually complement each other? Design and direction: Usha Ganguli. The 91st performance of the play by Rangakarmee, it is being presented to mark the groups foundation day.

 Event: Play in Hindi, Kashinama, produced by Rangakarmee 

When: Today at 7 pm

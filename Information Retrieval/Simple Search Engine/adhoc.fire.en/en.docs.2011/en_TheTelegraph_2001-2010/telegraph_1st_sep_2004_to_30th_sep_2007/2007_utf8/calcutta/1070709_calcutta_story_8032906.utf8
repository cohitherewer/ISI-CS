 A mans body was found in a hotel room near Howrah station on Sunday morning. The two men he had been sharing the room with had strangled him to death on Saturday night, police said. 

 The three identified as Ashok Ghosh, 42, Asim Ghosh, 38, and Ajit Ghosh, 35 checked into Chandraloke Hotel at 8.45pm on Saturday. They booked room No. 16, on the ground floor of the two-storey hotel, for the night.

 Ashok and Ajit identified themselves as sons of Manik Ghosh. The addresses in the register indicated that the trio hailed from the same village in the Ranigunge police station area of Burdwan district. 

 The identity of the man who was murdered has not been ascertained. The addresses and phone number given by the men in the register are false, said Milan Kanta Das, the additional superintendent of police (town). 

 Manik Mandal, an employee of the hotel, said: Around 9.15pm, the three came out of their room and went to a nearby restaurant for dinner. They returned at 10pm. The hotel-owner asked me to take a jug of water to their room. They locked the door after I came out. 

 Hotel-owner Gopal Sahu told the police that around 4am, two of the men woke him up and asked him to unlock the main gate so they could go out for a dip in the Hooghly. He grew suspicious after the two did not return even after 8am. He knocked on the door of their room repeatedly, to no response.

 Sahu alerted Golabari police station. A team of officers reached the hotel around 9am and broke open the door. They found the third mans body on the bed.

 Suman Das, the additional investigating officer of the police station, said: The body has been sent for post-mortem. It appears that the man had been strangled to death.

 Police launched a crackdown on gangsters in the Karaya area, the chief ministers neighbourhood, and arrested two youths late on Tuesday.

 Three improvised firearms, 32 bombs and 10 rounds of cartridges were seized from the duos hideout in Punjabipara, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (south).

 A search is on for the other members of gang.

 A fortnight ago, the police had picked up 10 criminals from the area, supposed to be a high-security zone, and seized seven firearms.

 The youths, in their late 20s, arrested during Tuesday nights raid have been identified as Ibrar Alam and Mohammad Manjur.

 The duo and other members of the gang had stocked the firearms and bombs as they were planning to attack a rival group in the locality, said an officer of Karaya police station.

 More raids will follow. We have been asked to launch a crackdown on criminals in the chief ministers locality, which has seen several clashes among gangsters in the past few years, he added.

 A year ago, two criminals had hurled bombs a few metres from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees residence. 

 The then officer-in-charge of Karaya police station, Dipak Dutta, was transferred as he had failed to arrest the goons.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 To use water, go by purse 

 A STAFF REPORTER

The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is planning to impose consumption-based water tax on households, scrapping an earlier proposal of charging a flat rate.

 As part of the system, water meters will be installed in houses to measure the consumption. In apartment blocks, the meter will be installed in individual flats.

 I think metering is the most scientific process, as it allows a house-owner freedom to decide on the quantity of water he will consume according to his purse, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Before introducing the system, a survey will be undertaken in Cossipore to work out details of the scheme.

 JUSCO (a 100 per cent subsidiary of Tata Steel), which is in charge of the town management in Jamshedpur, has made a presentation before the civic authorities for carrying out the survey. The company has been asked to submit an expression of interest.

 Calcutta is our focus area because of its proximity to Jamshedpur. We are interested in sharing our expertise in managing basic utility services with the Calcutta civic authorities, said JUSCO chief marketing officer K.C. Tewary.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the civic bodys annual income from water supply is Rs 26 crore, against an expenditure of around Rs 135 crore.

 The revenue earned by supplying filtered water is just half the annual power bill for running the waterworks and booster pumping stations, he pointed out.

 Mayoral council member (water) Mrinal Kanti Mondol said the survey will mainly examine the quality of pipelines and calculate wastage of water. 

 Cossipore has been chosen for the pilot project because it enjoys 21 hours of uninterrupted supply of filtered water (4 am to 1 am) under an agreement between the erstwhile North Suburban Municipality and the CMC, said chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity. The rest of the city gets water for six hours a day.

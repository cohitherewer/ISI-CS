 Rob scan on office peon

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Police have zeroed in on peon Sambhu Yadav in connection with the Rs 15-lakh robbery in the fifth-floor office of the Bansal Group at Crescent Towers, off Minto Park, on Monday. Yadav has been detained.

 A resident of Banka district in Bihar, Yadav has been working with the group for two years. He was privy to the companys financial information.

 Discrepancies were found in his statements, which aroused the suspicion of the police. It is not proper to comment on the progress of the investigation right now. Yadav has given us several versions of the incident, said deputy commissioner (south) Ajoy Kumar.

 Around 8.15 pm on Monday, three youths walked into the office and first overpowered the peon. They dragged him into a kitchen adjacent to the office entrance, tied him up and advanced towards manager Shankar Lal Poddar.

 The youths tied the manager to a chair and left with Rs 15 lakh in cash kept in his briefcase. 

 As the youths were climbing down the stairs, Poddar managed to free himself and raised the alarm. He called out to his driver Ram Chandra Mondal, asking him to the chase the youths.

 It seems that the three were known to Yadav. The peons claim that he was tied up is also suspect, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.

 According to the investigators, the youths were aware that Poddar usually carried lakhs of rupees with him. That the robbers came unarmed suggests they were very confident about the operation, stated another police officer.

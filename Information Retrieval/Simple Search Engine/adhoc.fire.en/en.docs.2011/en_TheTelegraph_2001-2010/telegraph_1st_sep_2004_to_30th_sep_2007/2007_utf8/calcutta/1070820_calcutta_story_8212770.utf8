 Romance of the rains

 In his music compositions inspired by the monsoons or invoking the season of rains, Tagore has ventured beyond common ragas and set tune to many of his verses in the more sedate and solemn classical notes of Iman, Kedar, Hambir, Sindhu, Kafi, Multan and Bhairavi, to name a few. Besides reflecting his depth of knowledge about classical music, the songs present an amazing amalgamation of the diverse moods of monsoon. Rabir Gaane Badol Ragini, a programme of Tagore songs and dances on the theme of the romantic character of the monsoons, attempts to highlight the Bards passionate sensitivity and response to natures magic. Participants: Suranjana Basu and Surajit Sen (classical music); Nandini Ghosal and Sharmila Bhattacharya (classical dance); Pramita Mallick, Swastika Mukhopadhyay, Debarati Som, Tamalika Guha, Apala Basu, Aniruddha Sinha, Prabuddha Raha, Rahul Mitra and others (Tagore songs) and Dr Sumit Basu, Esha Bhattacharya, Jhilli Chakraborty and others (dances with Tagore songs). Concept: Apala Basu.

 Event: An evening of music and dance based on Tagores romantic compositions on monsoon 

 When: Today at 6.30 pm 

 Where: Madhusudan Mancha

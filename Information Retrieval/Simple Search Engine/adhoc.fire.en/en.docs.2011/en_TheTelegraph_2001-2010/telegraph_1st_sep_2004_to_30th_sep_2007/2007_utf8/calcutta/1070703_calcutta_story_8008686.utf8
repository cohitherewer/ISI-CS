The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Classical Tagore

 A research oriented theme show, Legacies and a Legend, was staged at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar on June 27. It was organised by city based Rabindrasangeet school, Parampara, in association with You amp; I, a music production house. The occasion was the felicitation of veteran singer Suchitra Mitra and Fr P.C. Mathew (Principal, St Xaviers College, Calcutta). 

 The programme began with three group songs presented by the students of St Lawrence High School. Aniruddha Banerjee, a part of the chorus, said: I am honoured to have a chance to perform before such a legendary figure. 

 Rabindrasangeet singer Arpita Pal and music teachers of St Lawrence High School, pianist Sourendro Mullick and vocalist Soumyojit Das (in picture above by Bishwarup Dutta), performed at the show. Suchitra Mitra and managing director of Ananda Publishers, Subir Mitra were the narrators. Mullick and Das followed up the singing of Pal with classical vocal and instrumental strains based on thaats.

Sourendro did a piano rendition of Shiv Kumar Sharmas santoor composition, based on the Marwa thaat. This was followed by the thumri made famous by Bade Gulam Ali Khan, Ka Sang Kheloon Mein Phaag, by Soumyojit on the same thaat. Pal sang the Rabindrasangeet Emni Kore Jaye Jodi Din, to show that the song too was based on the Marwa. 

 I hope that Legacies and a Legend proves to be a good launching pad for Sourendro and Soumyojit. Both of them are talented young musicians and are keen to uphold tradition through their art, Mitra told The Telegraph. The 84-year-old maestro sang Khepa Tui Aachhis Aapon Kheyal to round off the evening. Painter Shuvaprasanna and Sanjay Budhia (MD Patton Group) were present on the occasion.

 We tend to ignore our art forms as we are too caught up in our hectic schedules. It was a great experience, said Moubani Sorcar, who was a part of the audience.

 The Diary

 Interims

 Another step forward, or just an indulgence? 

 It makes me sad, I cry, quot;

 Every step forward is two steps back 

 Not to forget, theres another you 

 A few scars cleaned, fingerprints removed 

 With saccharine and fabricated smiles! 

 Another attempt to enter the realm of love, 

 Laws learnt, memorised, yet not abided by 

 Failures scar the mind, 

 Much misjudged by the selfsame card readings! 

 A new hope with every new trial, 

 Sometimes the practical lessons fail 

 And the effort falls apart 

 Yet theres hope its the seasons last mistake.

 Alone on a battlefield

 Today as I sit amidst silence, 

 The chaos cries out for rest. 

 The black clouds remain unmatched, 

 The eternal blackness of a hapless soul. 

 Somewhere lingers the smell of victory, 

 That mocks the putrid smell of death. 

 The dove has forgotten how to fly, 

 Even the gods fight amongst themselves, 

 Holy water descends on the red earth. 

 Washing away bloodstains, healing a thousand wounds. 

 Where will the river of blood turn now, 

 Carrying with it the sins of man? 

 Ayan Majumdar, 

 Student

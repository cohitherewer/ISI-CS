 60-year-old foils rob bid in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Kalpana Chakraborty, a widow in her early 60s, aborted a robbery attempt at her residence in CG block, Salt Lake, on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The robbers, pretending to be carpenters, brandished a gun and snatched the gold chain she was wearing. But Chakraborty refused to be intimidated and alerted her neighbours by raising an alarm. 

 The attackers panicked and fled. However, the neighbours gave chase and managed to pin down one of them.

 According to Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), two men appeared at Chakrabortys front door around 11 am, and enquired whether she needed a carpenter to mend her sofa. 

 Coincidentally, she had purchased a sofa from Bidhannagar Mela three months ago and it needed repair. So, she agreed to let the men in, said Kumar. 

 To take Chakraborty into confidence, they displayed a catalogue with colour-samples of new sofa covers. As she sat down to choose a colour, the duo left the apartment, promising to send a carpenter within the next few hours.

 After an hour, two men arrived at her home, pretending to be carpenters. 

 The duo had planned to scare her with a revolver, but Chakraborty refused to panic and called out to her neighbours. The two men panicked and fled with the gold chain they had snatched, said an officer of Bidhannagar police station.

 Neighbours caught one of the robbers, later identified as Sheikh Raju, and handed him over to a patrol car. 

 Raju revealed to the police that he was acting on the instructions of a person called Mohammad Hazizur. 

 However, the cops are yet to nab the mastermind. The firearm and the gold chain have not been recovered.

 The identity of the first two men is yet to be ascertained. Were trying to find out whether they have kept a record of other customers who had visited the fair and bought furniture, said superintendent Kumar. 

 Two of Chakrabortys sons are settled in Delhi and Jamshedpur, while the eldest is an NRI engineer in Canada. Her husband, an army officer, died last year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dim hilsa hope on Sashthi

 - MANGO, CHICKEN PRICES SHOOT UP

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The silver harvest is too dear this season. So are fruits and fowl. A Telegraph picture 

 Heres a plate-ful of bad news for the jamais of Calcutta. 

 This Jamai Sashthi (Thursday), mothers-in-law may not be able to serve up their favourite fare; ilish. Chicken and mango, too, may be absent from the platter, as the prices of these commodities are skyrocketing. 

 This Thursday, be prepared to shell out an extra Rs 100 to Rs 150 to buy your favourite fresh-water fish as well. 

 The hilsa scarcity can be attributed to various factors, including absolutely no local supply of the fish, a ban by the fisheries department on hilsa weighing less than 500 gm and the rising demand for this delicacy among Bengalis settled in cities like Delhi and Bangalore. 

 The local hilsa supply is nil. As a result, we are completely dependent on supplies from Bangladesh, says Syed Anwar Maqsood, secretary of Hilsa and Varieties Fish Importers Association. 

 According to the association, 25,000 kg to 35,000 kg of hilsa make their way to the Calcutta markets from Bangladesh every day. Daily supplies have dropped 25 per cent. A lot of hilsa is making its way to cities like Delhi and Bangalore, where the concentration of Bengalis is very high. 

 The fisheries department has also become very vigilant so that nobody sells a fish that weighs less than 500 gm. 

 Chicken, too, is dear. The broiler variety is priced between Rs 60 and Rs 70 per kg, and country fowl is between Rs 100 and Rs 150 per kg in the retail markets. Earlier, chicken cost Rs 20 less per kg. 

 There is a huge gap between demand and supply. After the bird flu scare last year, production and supply lines were completely messed up. During important festivals, the crunch is severe, says Md Hussain, member of New Market Poultry Traders Association.

 The going rate for the langda variety of mango is Rs 25 to Rs 30 a kg, which is at least Rs 10 more than the usual price. According to fruit merchants, a bad crop has fuelled the hike in prices. 

 The langda in the market now is from Bihar. The crop has not been very good this year. Moreover, the local consumption in Bihar has increased and the mangoes are going to many other states as well, says Mohammad Sohrab, president, Calcutta Fruit Merchants Association. 

 There is little hope that the prices of mango will plunge when the langda from Uttar Pradesh hits the Calcutta fruit markets. There will be a negligible drop in prices, as the transportation cost is high.

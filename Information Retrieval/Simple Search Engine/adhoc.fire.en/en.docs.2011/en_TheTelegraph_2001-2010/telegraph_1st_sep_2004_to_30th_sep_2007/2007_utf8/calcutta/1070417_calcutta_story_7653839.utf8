 Tribute to a master filmmaker

 One of the most important representatives of the New German Cinema, the cinematic output of Rainer Werner Fassbinder is legendary. His central theme was the political and social corruption of post-war Germany. Fassbinder usually dealt with relationships based on violence, deception and oppression. Max Mueller Bhavan, Calcutta presents a select retrospective of 14 films by the controversial and prolific German director and playwright on the occasion of his 25th death anniversary. To be screened today are Love is Colder than Death (at 5 pm) and The American Soldier (at 7 pm). Fassbinders first feature film, Love is Colder than Death is set in a punishing German underworld where there is no honour among thieves. A black-and-white gangster flick, it depicts a trio of bumbling crooks conning and killing their way to a position in society that lies somewhere just above obscurity. Capturing the fatalism of low-life characters, the film also establishes the theme of betrayal and loyalty. The American Soldier (a moment from its filming appears right) is the deadpan tale of an American Vietnam vet of German descent who returns to his native Munich as a hired killer. A cynical examination of traditional Hollywood styles, the film has strong elements of parody. Shot with the cold eye of a political cartoonist, it offers a bold, flamboyant yet comic portrayal of human life.

 Event: A retrospective of films to mark the 25th death anniversary of Rainer Werner Fassbinder When: Till April 24; 5 pm and 7 pm Where: Max Mueller Bhavan auditorium

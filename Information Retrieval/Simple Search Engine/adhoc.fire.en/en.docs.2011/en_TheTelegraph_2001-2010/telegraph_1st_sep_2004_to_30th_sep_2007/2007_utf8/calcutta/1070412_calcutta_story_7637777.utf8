 Play with numbers

 There was a Dutch ardour to the second Sociable Intellectual Progressive (SIP) Abacus and Brain Gym Regional Competition at the Netaji Indoor Stadium with over a thousand young enthusiasts attired in bright orange vests. 

 The children, aged between five and 12 years (picture

 by Amit Dutta), belonged to eight

 different levels in ascending order

 of proficiency. They represented

 21 centres in the city, two others

 in Siliguri and Dankuni and those

 in the neighbouring states of Bihar,

 Jharkhand and Orissa.

 Eleven-year-old Archisman Mitra of Behalas Meghmala Roy Education Centre won top honours in level eight with Prashant Venkataramani of La Martiniere for Boys coming a close second. Both represented the Tollygunge centre.

 The question paper had sums like: 

 1.03+6.14+0.85+2.15+1.45+0.85-6.45+0.55+2.06+1.48

 6547x8

 3948/84

 5723/97

 How long do you suppose it would take you to solve a hundred of these? Well, the eighth levellers at the competition here were given just three minutes. And they were not using calculators either. They would probably laugh at the suggestion because their minds work faster than the calculator. The level one kids use the abacus. Those in levels two to eight also use the abacus but only in their minds.

 An abacus is a sort of calculator, often constructed as a wooden frame with beads sliding on wires. You calculate by shifting the beads. The abacus was in use centuries before the adoption of the written Hindu-Arabic numeral system and is still widely used by merchants and clerks in China, Japan, Africa and elsewhere. 

 It takes about four and a half months for kids to be gadget-free, said Janaki Venkatramani, area partner, West Bengal SIP Academy India Private Limited, adding: By the time students reach the second level of our programme, they will have mastered the technique of visualisation and they can be weaned from the actual gadget.

 Whats on your mind this week

 Anti-Team India exhibits after the World Cup

 2007 debacle 

Its not cricket

 Cricket

 has never been shrouded with such

 a pall of gloom as it is now. World

 Cup 2007 has seen it all, from Indias early exit, raging fans venting their anger on Dhonis under-

 construction house to Bob Woolmers death. Cricket is watched in all corners of the world but something as ghastly as fans launching an attack on a players home is not often witnessed. 

 These acts of vandalism cannot be justified in any way. Almost every Indian defeat is showcased as a conspiracy against the nation, and specifically by people who know precious little about the game. What if you have never played cricket, television can make the game look easy with its presentation and simulations. As a result, expectations start soaring. 

 But cricket fans of other countries do not belong to this type. Nor do they deplore their players with violent outbursts of rowdy behaviour.

 Take the instance of the Barmy Army, an organised group of cricket fans that facilitates touring parties of its members, to follow the English cricket team on its overseas tours. The group comprises enthusiastic people who cheer their players all the way. England does not win every match it plays. But the Barmy Army doesnt hurl insults at the English players every time they lose in the game. 

 After Indias exit from the World Cup, playing cricket has been virtually banned in pockets of rural Haryana. Such decisions are preposterous. People should try to have an insight into the prevailing conditions of Indian cricket. 

 The disturbances and furore only prove that so-called die-hard fans do not understand the game. They also fail to understand the trauma that their favourite players are now going through. 

 Its high time we correct our approach to cricket and endeavour to enjoy it for the love of the game.

 Changing times

 Culture

 and ethics have undergone a sea

 change since the times these words

 were coined. People have refuted

 social norms and indulged in pleasure

 and luxury. Promiscuity and adultery

 are the order of the day. 

 The trend verges on the uncontrolled. Relationships are becoming transitory. Commitments have long been shelved. And I wonder why people are promiscuous?

 Even apparently successful relationships reveal hidden chinks. Why is this trend increasing? Why are we forgetting the age- old customs of marriage and loyalty? No wonder divorces and cases for alimony are on the rise.

 One may not care to honour commitments, but no one has the right to make light of the vows that govern relationships. In the process, innocent lives are being affected. 

 Children too suffer unobservable deep wounds that fester throughout their lives when a family breaks. Who will take the responsibility for mending their disturbed futures?

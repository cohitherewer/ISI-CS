 Dubious dozen in flesh net

 - Sex racket smashed in Park Street residential highrise

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A flesh trade racket in the citys food-and-fun zone was busted late on Thursday, leading to the arrest of a dubious dozen. A residential highrise off Park Street yielded a catch of two young businessmen, the landlady of a flat, two pimps and seven young girls.

 Sabitri Chakraborty, in her late-30s, was accused of running the sex racket in her flat after her husband died a couple of years ago. We received a complaint from some families residing in the building on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (south).

 A police team of five moved in on Thursday night after receiving a tip-off that two pimps had entered the apartment with two clients. Plainclothesmen keeping a watch on the building saw seven young girls entering the apartment. One of the two clients was a Bangladeshi national, who identified himself as Aman Moin. He had come to Calcutta on a business trip. The other was Bapi Roy, a realtor from North 24-Parganas, said an officer.

 Chakraborty had converted her apartment into an air-conditioned sex chamber with seven cubicles, each with a bed and a mirror. From outside, no one could have guessed what was going on inside the second-floor apartment, said Shamim.

 Most of the seven women were from North and South 24-Parganas. They had told their parents they had got jobs in the city, said an officer.

 A preliminary investigation revealed that Chakraborty owns two shops on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A reign of three decades

 - 32 years in the same post as officer-in-charge of CID photography section at Bhabani Bhavan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ajit Sarkar has been in the seat of power longer than the West Bengal government. As officer in-charge of the photography section of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the 57-year-old completed 32 years in the same post in May 2007. 

 Last month, the Left Front government completed 30 years in power. 

 But unlike his political masters, Sarkar the reigning boss of a department for over three decades did not celebrate the occasion. It is a job for me and I am doing my duty. Why should there be a celebration? he asks when reminded of the record that he has created in the history of West Bengal police. 

 Sarkar joined the force in 1975 as sub-inspector. After the mandatory training in Barrackpore, he got his first posting at Bhabani Bhavan. And chances are that he will retire from the same department and take the same route to his Bally home, which he has been for over three decades. 

 I take a local train from Bally to Howrah and then cross the river. Then, I take a bus and reach office, adds the father of two sons. 

 In his initial days, the assignment involved organising photographs of criminal activities, studying them for leads and preserving them to facilitate investigation. 

 The work was not as structured in those days. Today, the department is bigger and we use the latest technology, he smiles, pointing to the computer and the scanner on his table. 

 But Sarkar dabbles not only with photographs. As everyone in Bhabani Bhavan is aware of his interest in gadgets and technology, his services are sought whenever there is tech trouble. He can fix air conditioners and water coolers. And whenever we request him to help us, he obliges, says a junior officer. 

 All my learning is from hands-on experience. Its no big deal, Sarkar contests the accolades. 

 According to him, his biggest passion photography is also a gift from the force. I have to love photographs. All my life, I have dealt with them, he signs off.

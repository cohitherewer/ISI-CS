 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 The alumni association of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta will hold its annual general meeting on September 30 to chalk out its plans for next year, and appoint a new executive community.

 Mrinmoy Roy, the executive director (raw materials division) of the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and president of the association, will retain his chair for another term.

 The association is also planning to take up consultancy projects for various companies across the country. These projects are part of the vision of the association, said Ashok Banerjee, the secretary of the alumni association.

 The members of the association use their own network of alumni members to take up consultancy projects. 

 We have already received favourable responses from both government and private enterprises about the decision to take up consultancy, said another alumnus.

 The meeting will also discuss how to step up the interface between industry, alumni, institute and students.

 Since we now have Ajit Balakrishnan as our governing body chairman, we have decided to increase interaction among industry, alumni and the academia, said Banerjee.

 The alumni executive community will also discuss plans to revamp the faade of the institute buildings and have offered to do up the Tata Hall.

 Along with these new activities, the alumni will continue to provide scholarships to needy students. 

 It provides two scholarships each academic year and will continue to provide the scholarships for the next five years, said Banerjee.

 After inter-IIM sports meet and the launch of a pan-IIM finance magazine, the alumni association is also actively working towards launching a pan-IIM brand next year. 

 The association feels that there is a need for a pan-IIM brand, so that the alumni base can be broadened. It will also distribute the brand across all the IIM campuses, said Ashoke Banerjee.

 The director of the institute Shekhar Chaudhuri and the dean (programme initiatives), Anindya Sen, will attend the meeting.

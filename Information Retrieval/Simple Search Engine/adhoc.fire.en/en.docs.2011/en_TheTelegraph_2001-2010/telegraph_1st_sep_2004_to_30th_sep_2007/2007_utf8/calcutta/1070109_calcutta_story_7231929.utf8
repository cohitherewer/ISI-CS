 ceramic and clay pottery from Japan 

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Shibata Marikos Still Life from Seto and Mino

 Like geisha, origami, kabuki, Noh and Sony, pottery is synonymous with the culture of Japan. The Japanese are well-versed in the art of ceramics and objects made from earth or clay are highly-prized. Not all of these have a utilitarian value and are valued as pieces of art. 

 Gallery Rasa, in New Alipore, in collaboration with the consulate-general of Japan, is holding an exhibition of contemporary Japanese ceramics which demonstrates how age-old traditions have evolved over the years, and how individual artists have used this as a medium of expression.

 Thirty-five artists are represented through 70 pieces of pottery from the seven regions in Japan where clay is available and where kilns have been set up. These regions are Arita and Karatsu, Hagi, Bizen, Kyoto vicinity and Tamba, Kutani and Kanazawa, Seto and Mino and Tokyo vicinity and Miashiko. Clay is not locally available in Tokyo but the presence of many pottery artists and admirers of their art have encouraged the practice of this art.

 According to the well-produced catalogue, the highlight of this exhibition, titled Japanese Pottery The Rising Generation from Traditional Japanese Kilns, which has already travelled to about 20 countries is the vessel not all of which are functional but are fascinating forms, nonetheless. Most of the artists are mature. Their works are on the way of becoming classics. Some are trying to leave the imprint of their sensibilities on their work.

 These vessels have an almost perfect finish and their colours are fresh and warm. Their textures vary in accordance with the content of iron in the clay. Even when their forms are not unusual they look outstanding because much thought must have gone into their making.

 When the plum blossom motif is used in a vessel from Arita and Karatsu, it is used with such delicacy that it resembles a bank of fluffy clouds that blends with the deep blue of the ground. Patterns used in bowls and vases from this region have a graphic quality and yet they come close to designs borrowed from nature.

 Akebi vine, lotuses, peonies, the daylily and the gloriosa lily bloom on the vessels. Some of the forms are so simple like the fresh water jar from Kutani and Kanazawa that they could be the jars used for storing salt and pickles here. But one has to inspect the carefully pitted surface to discover its artistry. The blue-glazed vase and bowl is exquisite enough to be passed off as foliage.

 From the Kyoto vicinity and Tamba come the platter with concentric circles which come close to the bindu of Raza. Another vessel looks like a huge pod while Okmura Hiromis vessel resembles a pelvic girdle out of Salvador Dalis imaginings. This region seems to have produced a whole lot of highly innovative artists with an original vision.

 Kaneta Masanaos pieces resembles chunks of rock. The caption describes them as pounded, hand-hollowed vase but they are far removed from the vases we are familiar with. 

 Kanwaguchi Juns witty tea set and bowl and Shibata Marikos paper thin Still Life are two of the most delightful pieces.

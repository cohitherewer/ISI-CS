 Fisticuffs in court cell

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two undertrials, waiting for a hearing of their cases, got into a fist fight in the Howrah court lock-up on Tuesday. They even beat up a group of police personnel that tried to intervene. 

 The police said the fight started around 2.30pm, when Guddu Singh, an aide of Ramua, an extortionist of Howrah, demanded a hefty sum from Ganga Roy, another gangster.

 Guddu and Ganga belong to rival groups, both engaged in extortion, robbery and snatching. The gangs have frequent shows of muscle power in the lock-up, cops claimed. 

 On Tuesday, Guddu allegedly attacked Ganga after he refused to cough up the money. 

 We knew that Guddu and Ganga will get into some fight or argument. I have requested the chief judicial magistrate to ensure that members of rival groups are not called for trial on the same day, said court inspector Chayan Kumar Ghosh. 

 This is the third incident of violence inside the Howrah Court jail in the past five months. 

 On February 2, 11 members of Guddus gang demanded Rs 30,000 from Samar Singh. When Samar refused to pay, Guddu tried to slash his throat with a razor and injured him. Samar was taken to the Howrah District Hospital. 

 On May 5, Biswajit Roy, alias Bapi, and Mohammad Iftikar, alias Munna, attacked Ganga Roy and Srikant Yadav with blades and razors. Both were admitted to the district hospital for treatment.

 After a visit to the spot, the chief judicial magistrate, Debasish Dutta, had asked for a detailed report. But no action has been taken in this regard.

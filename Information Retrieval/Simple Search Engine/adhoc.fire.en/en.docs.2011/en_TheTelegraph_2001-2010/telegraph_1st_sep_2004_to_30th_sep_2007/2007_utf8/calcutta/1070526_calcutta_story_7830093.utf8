The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bangla man held with fake papers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Bangladeshi national was arrested in a central Calcutta hotel on Friday afternoon on charges of possessing forged documents, including a PAN card and a ration card.

 While raiding his room, police also discovered several tech tools, one of which is used to operate a satellite phone.

 Sleuths suspect Abdul Kayum Rehman, alias Ibrahim Khaliullah, who had checked into the Muchipara hotel last week, of having links with a racket involved in helping infiltrators.

 Apart from fake PAN and ration cards, we recovered five SIM cards issued by cellphone service providers in Mumbai and Tripura from the hotel room, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police, detective department.

 The gadgets were purchased from the Chandni Chowk market. Abdul probably wanted to set up a secret unit to make international calls without the knowledge of Indian telecom agencies, Singh added.

 The sleuths were tipped off about Abdul, 47, by a guest in the Muchipara hotel, who reported that the lights in one of the rooms would remain switched on throughout the night.

 Among the documents seized from Abdul, who has houses in Jessore and Comilla districts, was a passport issued by the Bangladeshi government early this year.

 The passport shows he had entered India through Tripura on April 29. But we doubt whether the document is genuine, as it bears both his names, said Singh.

 He has also applied for an Indian passport, added another officer. The fake documents suggest that Abdul was trying to establish himself as an Indian citizen.

 Abdul reportedly told the police that he had started visiting the country from 2005. He had sneaked in several times in 2005 and 2006 and stayed in Tripura and Mumbai. He had even visited the US once. This time he wanted to settle in India after opening a telephone booth, said Singh.

 Police are also trying to find out whether he had any plans to carry out subversive activities in India.

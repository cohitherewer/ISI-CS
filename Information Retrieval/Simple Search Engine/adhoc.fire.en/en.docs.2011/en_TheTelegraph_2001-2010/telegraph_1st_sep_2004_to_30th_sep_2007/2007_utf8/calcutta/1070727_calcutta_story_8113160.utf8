 Children of a lesser God

 A play about children who are constrained to battle the cruel fate of life, Bhanga Buker Panjore, presented by students of Nehru Childrens Museum Theatre Group, strikes a poignant chord in the hearts of viewers. It is a story about brave young warriors who rise above their misfortunes to write their own destiny and create a better world for themselves. It introduces us to the dreary lives of orphans, destitute and homeless children. Forsaken by one and all, they have nothing to cherish in life. Even their dreams sink into the dark abyss of nothingness. Misery and loneliness also engulf the lives of children of affluent classes. Driven by an overwhelming ambition and desire to make their offspring succeed in all spheres of life, parents deny and destroy the possibility of budding, tender minds to flower beautifully, in their own natural way. Drama and direction: Romaprasad Banik

 Event: Play in Bengali, Bhanga Buker Panjore, produced

 by Nehru Childrens Museum When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Academy

 Repairs after roof collapse

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The roof collapse on Saturday at Anath Babu Bazaar, on Beadon Street, that killed eight-year-old Shibani Sau, has prompted Anath Nath Deb Trust Estate to take up repairs of the premises. 

 The estate runs the 126-year-old market, popularly known as Chhatubabur Bazar.

 We were informed about the poor condition of the ceiling only on Saturday. The collapse occurred before we could get the roof repaired, claimed Sunrit Deb, one of the trustees.

 At a meeting with the five trustees on Monday morning, members of Anath Babu Bazaar Byabosayee Samity demanded compensation for the victims family and reimbursement of treatment cost for the injured.

 The Samity also called for reconstruction of the roof and floor of the portion where the collapse occurred and relocation of those who had stalls there.

 We have sought the Calcutta Municipal Corporations help to conduct a survey of the market and demolish the damaged sections, said Pankaj Ghosh, Samity treasurer. 

 We have agreed to all the demands and proposals of the Samity. We have paid Rs 25, 000 to the deceaseds family and to those undergoing treatment. We are ready to provide more compensation, if necessary, stated Deb.

 He added: We are thinking about employing a civil engineer to guide us through the section-wise reconstruction of the market.

 Masters in form 

 - An exhibition of abstract work

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A work by Ram Kumar

 Some early paintings by M.F. Husain, including watercolours, Raza and Ram Kumar are being exhibited at Aakriti gallery along with the works of younger artists like Amitava Das, Mona Rai and others. This is the gallerys tribute to abstract artist Badhan Das, who died sometime ago.

 Most of the exhibits are abstract, and it is refreshing to see the non-figurative works of Husain, who even at his age, can conjure up figures on canvas or paper in a matter of moments. These works have that contemplative quality that one looks for in the best abstract works. There is one superb canvas dating back to 1962 in which Husain evokes an evening mood with varying gradations of moss green with an expanse of muddy brown at the centre, subtly worked over with stubby brushstrokes. This enhances the impression of gathering darkness.

 There are two watercolours of 1995 vintage. Husain uses the simplest of means two rectangles of red and orange, and masses of dark blue and the deepest of purples against a backdrop of cream in the second to create these works of captivating freshness. There are two works by S.H. Raza harking back to 1969 and 1970, respectively. The acrylic on board is black with chalk-like marks of white and grey. The lines and colours are kept to the minimum. They are even shorn of the sense of dynamism that is palpable in his famous bindu paintings. The second one is mostly shades of misty grey which obscures the suggestions of forms.

 Ram Kumars works acrylic on paper are ostensibly landscapes in austere ochre, green and blue. But like the paintings of Ganesh Haloi they go beyond specificities and are beautiful exercises in exploring spatial and chromatic relationships.

 There are two senior artists from Delhi Amitava Das and Mona Rai. Dass works in black with a tangle of nervous lines like a skein of thread, which has come undone, could have been inspired by textile design. But like Mona Rais work gold splattered with black and silver it looks quite contrived. Perhaps it is meant to be so.

 Horizontal lines run across Sunil Des grey canvases. They are as muted as Yogendra Tripathis paintings with their markings and their suffused pinks and blues. Samindranath Majumdar shows little sign of change. Amitava Dhars toothy carnivores are an anomaly among abstract works.

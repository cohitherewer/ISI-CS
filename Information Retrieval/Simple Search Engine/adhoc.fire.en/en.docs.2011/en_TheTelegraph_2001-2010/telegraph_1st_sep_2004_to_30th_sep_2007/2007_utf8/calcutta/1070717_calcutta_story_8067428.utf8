The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Deluge fears allayed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The weather improved on Monday as the low pressure that was near the Bengal coast on Sunday moved away from Calcutta to spread over Jharkhand and adjoining areas.

 Met officials, however, warned on Monday that a few spells of rain or thundershower are expected over the city and its adjoining areas in the next 24 hours, as the monsoon is active in Bengal.

 But we dont expect heavy showers on Tuesday. The sky will remain partly cloudy, said G.C. Basu, a director of Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.

 On Sunday, a prominent low pressure trough close to the Bengal coast had caused heavy rains in Calcutta and the south Bengal districts. It rained about 75 mm in Calcutta between 5.30pm and 8.30pm on Sunday. Till 8.30am on Monday, the city recorded 90 mm of rains.

 The rain had created panic among Calcuttans, who feared a repeat of the deluge in early July. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation authorities had alerted its pumping stations to be ready to tackle waterlogging in the event of heavy showers.

 The weatherman warned of heavy rains in isolated places in the districts over the next 24 hours. We expect heavy rains in the coastal districts. We also expect heavy rains in Jharkhand and Orissa, said a Met official.

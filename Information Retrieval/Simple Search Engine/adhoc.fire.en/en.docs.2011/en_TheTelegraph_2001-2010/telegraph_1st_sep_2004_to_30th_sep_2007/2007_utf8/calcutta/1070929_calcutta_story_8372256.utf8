 IIT tips on robotics

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tech brains will troop to the city on Sunday for a crash course in robotics.

 The workshop by students of the electrical, electronics, computer science and mechanical engineering departments of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, will also teach participants how to come up with successful business plans.

 The event at GD Birla Sabhagar is the first of a series of knowledge exhibitions planned this year as a prelude to IIT Kharagpurs annual technology-management festival, Kshitij.

 The idea is to generate interest in robotics among students, so that they pursue a career in this field, said Dipa Dubashi, the head (media relations) of Kshitij.

 The four-hour workshop will be attended by engineering students from Jadavpur University, Bengal Engineering and Science University and other colleges. Plus-II students from select schools will also attend.

 The Robotix Society of IIT Kharagpur will brief students on how to make robots and explain the features of robots made by students that have participated in various national and international competitions. Videos of famous robots will also be shown.

 Govind Bisht, a final-year student of IIT Kharagpur who was a semi-finalist at the Rice University business plan contest and a winner of the business plan competition at Kshitij 2007, will conduct a session on entrepreneurship. 

 He will offer tips on making winning business plans and securing funds.

 We expect more than 650 students to take part in the workshop, as it has something to offer not only to those who want to learn about robotics but also for those who want to become businessmen, said Dubashi. The Kshitij team will conduct such workshops across the country.

 The three-day fest that draws over 15,000 students from over 300 institutes across the country is scheduled from January 31 to February 3 next year.

 Kshitij is planned to test the technological prowess of budding engineers and the creative abilities of managers in setting up ventures and drawing up strategies.

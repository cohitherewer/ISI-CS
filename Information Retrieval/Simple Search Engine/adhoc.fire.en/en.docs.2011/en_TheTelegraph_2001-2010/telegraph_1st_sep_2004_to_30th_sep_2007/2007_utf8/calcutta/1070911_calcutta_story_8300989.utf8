 The aftershock of a flyover collapse near Banjara Hills in western Hyderabad on Sunday was felt at Bagha Jatin in south Calcutta on Monday.

 Rattled by the cave-in of the under-construction flyover, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to demolish and then rebuild the damaged Bagha Jatin railway overbridge on which vehicles were plying till late on Monday.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the bridge would be closed to traffic from Tuesday and demolished to prevent a mishap. We cannot risk a Hyderabad-like incident, he added.

 A large chunk of the six-year-old bridge over the Bagha Jatin railway line at the south-eastern end of the Bypass, had fallen off on August 18, leaving a gaping hole. The damaged portion was barricaded but traffic was not stopped.

 Officials said more cracks have appeared on the bridge over the past few weeks. Railway contractor Ircon, which had built the bridge, has been accused of negligence as the concrete slabs were found to be six inches and not eight inches thick.

 The company has agreed to rebuild the bridge at its own expense to avoid being blacklisted. Both the railways and the CMDA will supervise the reconstruction, said CMDA chief engineer Debdas Bhattacharya.

 The demolition and reconstruction will cost close to Rs 1 crore and take around three months. The CMDA will later build another three-lane bridge parallel to the new one.

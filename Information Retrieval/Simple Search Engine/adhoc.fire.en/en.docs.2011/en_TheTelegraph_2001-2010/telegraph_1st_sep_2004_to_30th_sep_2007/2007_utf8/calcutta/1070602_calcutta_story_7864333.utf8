The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dalhousie doll-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Underground parking lots and shopping arcades, riverfront upgrade, open-air theatres and revival of heritage buildings... yet another perspective plan for the beautification of Dalhousie Square, or BBD Bag, has been laid out before the state government.

 The proposal, placed by Consultant Engineering Services (CES) on Friday, will need hundreds of crores to implement. It covers the area from Laldighi to Strand Road and Shahid Minar.

 The highlights include construction of two underground parking lots and laying of a glass tunnel in Laldighi, where colourful fish will be released. 

 A steel tower, much like the Eiffel Tower, has been proposed in front of Telephone Bhavan to mask the ugly building. 

 An open-air theatre for performing arts and food courts by the waterbody will complete the picture.

 We have begun work on the beautification of Dalhousie Square, starting with an underground parking lot at Laldighi. Once the car park is built, we will set up a garden with decorative fountains on the surface, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, who attended the presentation.

 Among the others present at the meeting were mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and representatives of the urban development department and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.

 Underground bus depots and shopping arcades have been proposed at Shahid Minar, while the parking lot under Laldighi should be extended towards the BBD Bag bus stand in an L shape, the minister said. The CES has also proposed stretching the Laldighi underground parking lot up to Strand Road, with facilities for shopping and recreation.

 Dilapidated buildings on the eastern side of the waterbody will be restored and shopping centres built to draw people even at night. The consultant has suggested that the GPO building be preserved as a museum.

 There have been numerous suggestions for beautification of BBD Bag from experts and consultants, including architect Charles Correa, but the government did not have the finances for implementation. The funding of the CES project, too, is undecided.

 30 ill after meal in school

 A STAFF REPORTER

 More than 30 students of the Elliot Road (Hindi medium) branch of Assembly of God Church School fell ill on Monday, after eating the mid-day meal on the campus.

 The school authorities have ordered an inquiry into the incident. An inquiry has been ordered, said A. Kurian, principal and assistant administrator of the school. More than 300 children have the meal every day. Only a few have fallen ill.

 The students, between five and 14 years of age, complained of intestinal pain soon after reaching home. Some also vomited and had loose motion. 

 They were taken to Mission of Mercy Hospital, on Park Street, where 22 students were admitted and the rest were discharged after primary treatment. On Tuesday morning, some more students were admitted.

 The symptoms are not as serious as that of food poisoning. The children are suffering from an acute gastro-intestinal disorder, said Partho Bandyopadhyay, senior surgeon at the hospital. 

 A hospital official said the students are all residents of the Park Lane and Elliot Road areas. 

 My daughter started vomiting and complained of stomach ache soon after she came home from school, said the mother of six-year-old Tanisha Raut, who is being administered drip in the paediatric ward of the hospital.

 My daughter vomited several times and was having a severe stomach pain, said the mother of 10-year-old Nandini Das. Nandini, she said, was fine when she left home for school in the morning.

 The children showed similar symptoms after eating rice, boiled egg and gram at school, said another parent.

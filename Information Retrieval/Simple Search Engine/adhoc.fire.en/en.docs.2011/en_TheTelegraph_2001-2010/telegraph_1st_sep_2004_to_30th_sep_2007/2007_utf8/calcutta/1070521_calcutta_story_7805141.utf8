The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Challenged, successful

 - ICSE, ISC 2007

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mohit Mehta,16, walks with the help of crutches but has been able to match steps with his classmates at St Josephs College, Bowbazar, by scoring 66.4 per cent in his ICSE exam this year

 Atul Tiwari of MP Birla Foundation School has scored 65 per cent, despite being in a wheelchair since his childhood

 Life has been a struggle for physically-challenged students like Mohit and Atul. But like Mohit and Atul, most of them have beaten all odds by scoring outstanding marks in the ISC and ICSE examinations this year.

 Mohit was afflicted with cerebral palsy when he was a child. But his physical ailments had never let him lag behind his classmates. His movement was affected by cerebral palsy and he developed a squint. Besides, his speech was also slurred, said mother Alka Mehta, adding that his teachers and classmates had supported him all through. 

 The examination council had provided Mohit with a writer, who was a Class VIII student. But I think he could not understand his words, especially in the English paper. I feel he could have scored much more than 66.4 per cent. However, we are extremely happy with his result, she added.

 The success has elated Mohit and he dreams of becoming a successful lawyer in the future. 

 Atul was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy when he was just six years old. But he never allowed his wheelchair to get in the way of his dreams. Two years ago, Tiwari stood first in ICSE by scoring 75 per cent, the highest among the physically-challenged candidates in Calcutta. 

 His hard work was the key to his success. He was a dedicated student and we are very proud of his outstanding performance, one of his teachers said.

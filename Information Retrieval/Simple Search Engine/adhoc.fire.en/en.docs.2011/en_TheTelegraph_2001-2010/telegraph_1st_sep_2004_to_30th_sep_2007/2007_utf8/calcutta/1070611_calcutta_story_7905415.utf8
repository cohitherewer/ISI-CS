 Wetlands in tit-for-tat project veto

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The war over the wetlands between two state government departments has intensified.

 The land reforms department has opposed the fisheries departments proposal to set up an aquatic park and aquarium within the East Calcutta Wetlands.

 This follows a run-in over the fisheries departments move to allow sale and purchase of parts of the wetlands.

 Land reforms commissioner P.K. Agarwal wrote to fisheries secretary R.P.S. Kahalon on Thursday, expressing his departments opposition to the proposal to set up the park and the aquarium.

 Agarwal also sought to know how the fisheries department could carry out construction without tampering with the character of the wetlands, declared a no-development zone by the high court.

 Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda, however, said he was confident that the project would clear all hurdles.

 We have narrowed down the area earmarked for the project to around 350 acres, which is free of all encumbrances. The park and the aquarium will come up in the buffer zone and will not touch the core area of the wetlands. I have personally explained the matter to the chief minister, he added.

 The project was to initially come up on 585 acres in Bhagwanpur and Jogtipota mouzas. The Fort group has been chosen as the main investor.

 The state cabinet, presented with the proposal three months ago, had deferred its approval and suggested that the status of the land be verified first.

 The fisheries department later scaled down the land size to 475.5 acres, before sending a renewed proposal to the land reforms department. The area was further cut to 350 acres.

 Land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said he had ordered a joint inspection of the area.

 Though the fisheries department wants a quick clearance from us, we cannot oblige them. Apart from the fact that the area lies within the East Calcutta Wetlands, we are also concerned about the status of the land there. Part of the land is vested land, while much of it is owned by individuals, said Mollah.

 The current episode is the latest in a series of tiffs between the two departments over the East Calcutta Wetlands.

 Last week, Mollah had questioned the fisheries departments right to issue a notice that allowed sale and purchase of 1,500 acres of the wetlands.

 Nandas department issued the order after its bid to acquire land in the zone was thwarted by the land reforms department.

 Symbolic structures

 Based on the realisation that the sustainability of artistic worth depends on the revelation of paradoxes, Debanjan Roy articulates the ambiguous, post-modern concepts of commercialisation of social and human needs through his works. In the ongoing exhibition, his assemblage of sculptures rips the cover off from the current consumerist culture. His strategy of visualisation is built upon simulation of a particular situation, using caricatures for emphasis. The symbolisation of the meat image in his works has multiple implications. Gluttonous devouring of meat serves as a metaphor for subtle, yet obvious political undertones indicating a predatory hunger for power. The greed-distorted faces and hands of men, besides suggesting a concern with politics of power, also points to the hypocritical veneer of civility that vanishes as soon as the grub comes up for grabbing.

 lEvent: An exhibition of sculptures by Debanjan Roy lWhen: Till April 28; 1 pm - 7 pm lWhere: Gandhara Art Gallery, 1B Gurusaday Road, Flat 5A (Palm Springs)

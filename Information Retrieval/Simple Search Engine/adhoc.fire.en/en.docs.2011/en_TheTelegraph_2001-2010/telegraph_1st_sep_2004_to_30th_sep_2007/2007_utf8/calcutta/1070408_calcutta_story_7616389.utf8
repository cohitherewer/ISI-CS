The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Painter of the dark days

 Bikash Bhattacharjees upbringing in the Shyampukur area of north Calcutta had made such a deep impression on his growth as an artist that the streets, alleys, rickshaws and crumbling dwelling houses kept recurring in his works. This neighbourhood was also the breeding ground of the Naxalite movement, and those dark days in the citys history had inspired the artist to create some of his most powerful canvases.

 Although initially it was not meant to be so, Manasij Majumders lavishly-illustrated book, Close to Events, Works of Bikash Bhattacharjee, is a fitting tribute to the artist who died last December. The book published by Niyogi Offset was released by artist Amitabha Banerjee at Park Hotel on Friday evening. The foreword is by M.F. Husain.

 Majumder, former art critic of The Telegraph, spoke about his difficulty in interviewing Bhattacharjee owing to his prolonged illness. At that time, Bhattacharjees daughter Balaka, who is a practising artist herself, was away in London. Majumder said the book was not a biography but a critical assessment of Bhattacharjees work.

 Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who was the chief guest and an obvious admirer of Bhattacharjees work, spoke with gentle humour of how he got the artist to rectify a mistake in the caption of one of his paintings hanging at Raj Bhavan. Balaka spoke movingly about how the book was created.

 Some leading artists of the city were present at the launch. It is not everyday that one sees Jogen Chowdhury, Ganesh Pyne, Ganesh Haloi, Sunil Das, Mrinal Sen and litterateur Buddhadeb Guha under one roof. 

 Tribute to her master

 Late Ustad Bismillah Khan. 

Tracing the life and times of shehnai player Ustad Bismillah Khan, his adopted daughter Soma Ghosh has recently produced a docu-drama on the maestro titled Yaadein Bismillah focussing on his childhood years, his arrival at Benaras and his first tryst with the shehnai . 

 I felt the need to preserve his life-story and decided to film it in the form of a documentary with actors from Benaras, says Ghosh, who is from Benaras, but keeps coming to the city. The documentary lays emphasis on the guru-shishya tradition and spans the venues of the artistes last performances. The film has been scripted and directed by Shubhankar Ghosh and will be launched in New Delhi next month. 

 Thereby hangs a dance

 With our lives following a January-December routine, the Bengali calendar is fast losing relevance. Folk traditions are fading. Sanskar Bharati, a cultural organisation, has propped up both by combining them in a calendar. While the focus was on festivals last two years, this time it is folk dance, said Bikash Bhattacharya, secretary of the organisation. 

 Take Baisakh. Many may have heard of Chhou, the main item for the month, but how many know of the martial dance, Raibenshe, a performance that requires no music and is associated with the Bratachari tradition? Or of the Nachnis who are fighting extinction in Purulia? 

 Rabindra Bharati University dance department head Mohua Mukherjee and Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre deputy director Ranajit Samaddar have helped with the research. The calendar, with 12 Bengal dances and 48 from other states, will be released by actor Victor Banerjee, who helms Sanskar Bharati, at EZCC, Salt Lake, on April 12.

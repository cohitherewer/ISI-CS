The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Civic night guards to avert flooding

 A STAFF REPORTER

The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will depute two engineers at each of the 19 pumping stations at night. The step was taken to prevent a recurrence of a Wednesday-like situation.

 We will post an assistant engineer and a sub-assistant engineer at night. In case of a midnight shower, they can immediately run the pumps and drain out the water. We can then avoid the waterlogging to some extent, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Thursday.

 But for better tackling of waterlogging, Calcuttans will have to wait till September 2008. They cannot expect anything better if it rains like Wednesday, the mayor added. 

 The civic body is also planning to get the rain-gauging systems, installed at the pumping stations, checked by the Met office. The step was taken following variations in the average rainfall reading. 

 On Wednesday, the civic bodys average rainfall was 93 mm per hour, whereas the Met department recorded it as 45 mm per hour.

 The Met office measures the rainfall at Alipore and Dum Dum, while the civic drainage department measures it at Dhapa, Palmerbazar, Ballygunge, Mominpur, Kalighat and Topsia.

 On Wednesday, we recorded the maximum rainfall of 136 mm at Mominpur and the lowest of 54 mm at Dhapa. So, the average rainfall was 93 mm. This variation has been causing a lot of confusion. The gauging system should be cross-checked by some competent authority, observed acting chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) Tushar Ghosh.

 The civic body will hold a meeting with the irrigation and fisheries departments, so the lockgates at Bantala can be kept open during the showers.

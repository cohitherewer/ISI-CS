 Tech firm in global toplist

 A home-bred network security firm, with its origin in IIT Kharagpur, has made it to the global league of network security companies. iViz is the only Indian company that has made it to the semi-finals of the Global Security Challenge competition, which will be held on Wednesday in Singapore.

 The Global Security Challenge (GSC) is an annual event to identify the most promising security start-up in the world. The mission of the GSC is to stimulate technological innovations that make airports, cities and enterprises safer without encroaching on civil liberties.

 The GSC is organised by London Business School and supported by big names like Accenture, Bosch, the US Department of Homeland Security and CapVista.

 A start-up taking part in the GSC must offer a technology product that can be used to prevent, defend against, cope with or recover from terrorist incidents, other criminal acts and natural disasters, in addition to identifying or locating perpetrators of these acts. The iViz software fulfils this criterion, says Bikash Barai, a co-founder and the CEO of iViz Solutions. 

 Formed in 2005, iViz has developed an artificial intelligence-based automated penetration testing tool (marketed under the name of Bramhastro) that can emulate human hackers to find vulnerabilities in a network that are not detected by other forms of testing. The software can run from within the network or from a remote location.

 The report generated at the end of a session lists the loopholes. Penetration testing enables companies to find out how effective their current security measures are.

 Our automated penetration testing tool is a one-of-a-kind on-demand testing tool. One just has to go to our website and start the procedure by clicking on a link, says Barai.

 In the semi-finals, iViz will compete against four security start-up companies from Singapore and Australia to fight for a slot in the final round, to be held on November 8.

 The winners of the Asia leg will compete against the winners of the American and European legs. The champion start-up will walk away with a kitty of $500,000 and mentorship from Paladin Capital Group.

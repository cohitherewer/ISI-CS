 10-year-old felled by friend blow; doctor under cloud 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Somnath Karmakar, who died on Sunday 

 A scuffle between two friends over seat-sharing in class led to the death of a 10-year-old boy in Howrah. 

 Somnath Karmakar a Class IV student of Mahatma Ashwini Dutta Vidyapith, Liluah received a blow on his face from classmate Sourav Thander on Saturday. More than 24 hours later, Somnath succumbed to his injury.

 He was a calm and quiet boy We cannot understand how this happened, sobbed Mamoni Dolui, Somnaths elder sister.

 Though the Karmakars do not blame Sourav, they have decided to press charges against Dr Uday Saha, who treated Somnath after he was brought home on Saturday afternoon with a bleeding nose.

 On returning home from the school, Subhash Karmakar an umbrella vendor took his son to Saha. According to the family, the doctor administered an injection and gave the boy some medicines.

 But his condition did not improve and he started throwing up blood from Sunday afternoon. We contacted the doctor over phone, but he asked us not to worry and rub ice around his nose, recounted Mamoni, who lives in nearby Belgachhia, Liluah.

 As Somnaths condition worsened and he fell unconscious, he was rushed to the doctors chamber, barely a 10-minute walk from their Kunjapara home. It was an emergency, but he made us wait for half-an-hour. Finally when he saw Somnaths condition, he advised immediate hospitalisation. We took him to Howrah District Hospital but it was too late by then. My brother was declared brought dead, said Mamoni. 

 Had the doctor been careful, I would not have lost my brother. We have filed charges against the doctor, added Mamoni. 

 Officers in the Golabari police station, however, did not confirm if any FIR was filed against the doctor. 

 When Metro visited Sahas rented home off Belgachhia Road and his Kunjapara chamber, on Monday afternoon, both were under lock-and-key.

 At the Karmakar familys tile-roof home in Liluah, Subhash and his wife Shyamoli were inconsolable at the loss of their youngest son. We tried our best after he came back home with a bleeding nose, but we have lost him, mumbled Subhash.

 Somnath received the fatal blow on Saturday during the mathematics class. He and his Liluah neighbour Sourav were sitting next to each other when teacher S.R. Sarkar entered the classroom. 

 Sourav and Somnath were pushing and shoving each other for more elbow-room on the bench. Suddenly, Sourav hit Somnath. 

 I was checking copies Hearing a commotion, I looked up and saw Somnath bleeding from his nose. I immediately took him and Sourav to the headmaster, said maths teacher Sarkar. 

 When the authorities learnt of Somnaths death, the school was closed on Monday after a condolence meeting. 

 This is really sad This should never have happened, said head-teacher Sushanta Palodhi.

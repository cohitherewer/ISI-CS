 Womens cricket hope

 - Padding up after elections

 RITH BASU

 Women cricketers from the state are taking more interest in the upcoming Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) election than ever before. Having come under the ambit of cash-rich CAB last month, the women are banking on funds from the association to give a new lease of life to their chosen sport.

 The infrastructure for womens cricket is much better in other states, especially in Mumbai and Delhi, says former Bengal pacer and ex-junior womens team coach Subhra Bhaduri. In 2003, we were struggling to gather money for train tickets from Jamshedpur to Howrah after the national Under-16 final, while the Andhra Pradesh team flew home. We hope things will improve now. 

 The CAB, however, reacted late to the boards directive to the affiliated state associations to include womens cricket in their purview. We held a special general meeting to bring women cricketers into the fold, says the vice-president of the CAB, Rusi Jeejeebhoy. After the elections, a committee will be formed to look after womens cricket.

 Swapan Sadhu, a former coach of the Bengal womens cricket team, welcomed the development. The member of the West Bengal Womens Cricket Association, which was managing womens cricket in the state, feels infrastructure, funds and transport facilities of the womens game will receive a boost. 

 Women cricketers had to wait till the middle of summer to play their league games. We expect this to change, says Sadhu, who has been coaching women cricketers at Vivekananda Park since 1983.

 Lack of funds has long been the bane of womens cricket in Bengal, says Bhaduri, who is tipped to be the next coach of the state senior team. Sponsorship is hard to come by. When there are matches outside town, the state team members have to pay for train tickets from their own pockets. And most players are from poor families, adds the coach of Rising Star Sports Club. 

 Sadhu recalls that in 2002-03, a Bengal team had to travel back to the city from Chandigarh by second-class after securing third position in the junior nationals. We didnt even have the money for reservation. The girls were huddled together in the bunks with huge kit bags. It was inhuman. 

 The current vice-captain of the national team and arguably the fastest bowler in the world in womens cricket, Jhulan Goswami, and Rumeli Dhar were in that team.

 Things, however, are looking up. According to the CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal, the association will grant women cricketers the facilities offered to men. He said: We will organise not only a league for the seniors every year but also tournaments at the junior level.

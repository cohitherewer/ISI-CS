The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Road rules are for breaking

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 The spurt in fatal road accidents in the city over the past few weeks has turned the focus back on the loopholes in traffic management. Even a section of officers in the traffic department admits that there has been a marked slackness in the enforcement of road rules.

 Retraded tyres are used freely, in violation of the motor vehicles rules, pointed out Prakash Ghosh, secretary of the North 24-Parganas Passengers Association. There had been a crackdown on those engaged in retrading tyres, but such units are flourishing again on roadsides, in full view of the public and police.

 Retrading involves pasting a rubber sheet over an old, worn-out tyre. As two separate layers are created on the tyre, vehicles like buses and trucks take a long time to stop after the driver applies the brakes.

 Police have also been slack in the enforcement of the stop line regulation. A white line has been drawn at every major crossing and vehicles are required to stop before it when the signal turns red.

 Traffic sergeants tried to enforce the rule strictly when it was introduced a year ago. But now, violation is rampant and action against violators is virtually unheard of, said Dhananjoy Dutta, secretary, All Bengal Bus Passengers Association.

 There has also been a sharp rise in the use of mobile phones while driving, instances of rash driving and illegal overtaking, and loading goods in passenger vehicles all because of police inaction, Dutta added.

 Middle-level traffic officers, on their part, complained of departmental problems in imposing the road rules.

 The signals at several crucial crossings like on the EM Bypass, Chittaranjan Avenue and BB Ganguly Street are not functioning properly. The timer signal at the Maniktala crossing hardly works, complained an officer.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim, however, denied the charges: All our traffic signals are functioning properly.

 A team of doctors is on the way to Sierra Leone from Calcutta. The mission is to extend a hand of help to a war-ravaged country, from where many flee and where few venture to.

 We are going to render a service where it is needed most. The country has no health infrastructure. Most medical experts escaped during 15 years of civil war. Our team comprises five doctors from the city, four from Assam and one from Nepal, said ophthalmologist Subhashish Nag, who is leading the Rotary districts 3290 and 3240 team that includes surgeons, a gynaecologist, a dentist and an anaesthetist.

 Diamonds have been the bane of the west African country, founded by slaves freed from the Americas in the 18th Century. The British controlled the mines till 1961. Later, the gems caused an uprising against the political elite. The rebels control much of the diamond region. They kidnap boys to work in diamond mines and chop off their hands when they gain adulthood, explained Rotary Foundation coordinator Ravi Sehgal.

 There are two hospitals, both in capital Freetown one run by local Indians and the other resurrected in 2006 by the health minister, who is herself a Rotarian. Few can afford treatment. In the government hospitals, doctors have to buy medicines from outside. Many die on the way from the districts, Nag explained the ground reality.

 The 700 kg of equipment the team is taking along includes basic necessities like gloves, calipers and microscopes. We do not know what to expect, the doctor shrugged. 

 The surgeons would be at risk of infection. We will be wearing double gloves and washing our hands with antiseptics. We are also carrying vaccines in case of needle pricks, pointed out gynaecologist Aruna Tantia. And mind you, the area is an HIV-endemic zone.

 One-third of the mothers, said Dr Arabinda Ray, die at childbirth. According to the data the team has collected, while our babies weigh about 3.5 kg, newborns in Sierra Leone weigh about 5 kg. And they seldom go to hospital for delivery, added Tantia.

 The trip is going to be all work and no play. We have been warned against venturing out at night after work without protection, said Ray. During its 15-day stay, the team is expected to perform about 450 eye operations and 60 surgeries, treat 100 orthopaedically handicapped patients, and share expertise with local doctors.

 Clinic letter to CM

 A STAFF REPORTER

 AMRI Hospitals authorities wrote to the chief minister and the health minister on Monday stating that they will shut down their Salt Lake facility if an agitation by a section of Citu-backed staff continued.

 The hospital, formerly known as Suraksha Hospital, has restricted admissions since Saturday afternoon after housekeeping, kitchen and wards employees stopped working more than eight hours a day. Many patients were left unattended to for hours at the hospital over the past two days.

 The supply of food to the patients has become irregular. Relatives have to bring in food for the patients, said sources at the hospital.

 Several patients took discharge on risk bond on Monday and shifted to other hospitals.

 The chief minister has been informed about the agitation by a section of employees backed by Citu, said a hospital spokesperson. Patient services have been hit by the agitation. If this continues we will have to shut down the hospital.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said he was out of the city and was not aware of the letter.

 In the letter, the hospital authorities alleged that the Citu-backed staff were using musclemen to create tension in the hospital. We had informed the police but they did not take action, said the spokesperson. 

 The trouble started last month after four members of the Suraksha Hospital employees union, including its secretary Swapan Mullick, were suspended. They were charged with negligence of duty. After an internal inquiry, three were reinstated but Mullick was dismissed.

 The management alleged that Mullick, a technician who handled sterilisation machines, had stopped work during a surgery.

 False charges were framed against Mullick and others, alleged a leader of Paschim Banga Security and Co-Workmens Union, affiliated to Citu. Some of the employees are forced to work for 24 to 32 hours continuously.

For those on the campus, it was the passport to professional life. And students from across the state grabbed the opportunity.

 Gateway 2007 (picture below by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya), a two-day job fair organised by the science club of Jadavpur University (JU) on the campus, offered openings in BPOs, human resource development departments, media and telecommunication.

 The two-day fair, inaugurated by state information technology minister Debesh Das on February 1, attracted about 14 companies, including big names like Wipro, United Bank of India, Tata Indicom, Dell and Tara Bangla. The footfall exceeded 10,000.

 Registration at the fair was open to all who had cleared the 10+2 examination. Even part-time opportunities were on offer, said Priyanka Mukherjee, a second-year undergraduate student of international relations at the university and a member of the fair committee. Applicants had to submit resumes before appearing for short interviews to assess their communication and language skills.

 We are testing the spoken-English skills of the students as we deal with international clients, said Saurrish Ghosh, director of Delta, which was recruiting for Wipro. More than 350 candidates turned up at the recruiting agencys stall on the second day of the fair. Shortlisted candidates were issued selection letters. The final interview will be conducted at the Salt Lake office, added Saurrish.

 While some companies participated in the fair with a recruitment target, others kept their options open. We plan to recruit about 435 employees per month for Wipros Sector V office, said Saurrish, who is also a final-year mathematics student at JU. 

 Dell was recruiting for its BPO in Hyderabad. The minimum qualification required was graduation. By next week, the shortlisted candidates will be informed about the interview date, said a recruiting official at the Dell stall. More than 600 resumes were submitted at the stall.

 Many of the youngsters who dropped in at the fair visited all the stalls. I am trying my luck here, as I did not do well in the campus interview, said Subhranil Das, a final-year B.Tech student at Netaji Subhas Engineering College.

 Sudhansu Mohanty, a Cuttack resident undergoing training in the city, submitted resumes at several stalls. I hope to get at least one offer, said the final-year Master of Computer Application student at Allahabad University. 

 The planning for the job fair, sponsored by Technable, started a couple of months ago. The idea was appreciated by the university authorities, said Priyanka. According to her, the fair committee is planning to make the event an annual affair.

 Run for country

 A day to watch the parade on television and hang out with friends and family thats what Republic Day is to most. For 10 youngsters, though, this January 26 was not like any other holiday. They, the future of the country, raised a toast to the past on the occasion.

 The youngsters, most of them students, organised a Run for India in south Calcutta, covering Gol Park, Rashbehari, Lake Market and Bhowanipore, under the umbrella of CHYK (Chinmaya Yuva Kendra), a voluntary organisation committed towards nation building through personal growth.

 Dressed in national colours and armed with the Tricolour, the youngsters ran almost 10 km, distributing flags and memorabilia to pedestrians on the route. The aim was to create awareness on issues like not littering the road and tree plantation.

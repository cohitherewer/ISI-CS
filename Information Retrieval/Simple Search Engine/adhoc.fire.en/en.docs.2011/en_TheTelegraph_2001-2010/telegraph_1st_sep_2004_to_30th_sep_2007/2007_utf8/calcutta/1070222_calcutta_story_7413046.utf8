The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lost? Simply click for location

 JULIUS GOMES

A detailed map of the city is just a click away, thanks to a pioneering national initiative in Internet cartography.

 The map, available at www.natmomap.in, allows those with Internet access to zoom in on buildings, restaurants, hotels, tourist spots, banks, bus terminuses, streets, educational institutions and emergency services like blood banks, hospitals, police stations and fire stations in Calcutta and Salt Lake.

 Those with GPRS-enabled cellphones can also avail of the facility, which is similar to Google Earth but lays more stress on user utility. Calcutta is the first city where the service has been launched. 

 The map has been developed by the Centres National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organisation (Natmo), in association with the Indian wing of the California-based Environmental Systems Research Institutes (ESRI), over five years.

 We are experiencing teething problems in terms of speed. The service is being tested by Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited. It is a novel venture, so glitches were expected. We have strategies in place to tackle them, said Natmo director Prithwish Nag.

 According to Chiradeep Adhikari, regional technical head, ESRI (India), the online map will not only show the location desired, but also the streets leading to it, the landmarks nearby and the name by which the area is popularly known. 

 In future, the service can be used to find out all possible routes between two points in the city. So, someone stuck in a snarl on Mahatma Gandhi Road on his way south down Central Avenue, will be able to download to his GPRS-enabled cellphone maps tracing all alternative routes to Esplanade.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rs 600cr for hotels, flats

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Delhi-based mega builders DLF on Friday unveiled plans to build two hotels and a service apartment block in the city, in partnership with the US-based Hilton group.

 The composite project, to come up on a 5.54-acre plot on the EM Bypass, will cost Rs 600 crore, making it the largest investment in Calcuttas hospitality sector.

 The DLF paid Rs 154 crore in an international auction conducted by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to snap up the plot, near ITC Sonar Bangla, last year.

 We hope to start work on the project this year and complete it within 36 months, said A.S. Minocha, chairman of DLF Commercial Developers. Officials of the DLF were in the city for the forthcoming initial public offer of the company. 

 We decided to maximise the land available with us and take up a composite project, said Surojit Basak, chief financial officer of DLF Home Developers.

 According to him, one of the hotels will be a 250-room, five-star deluxe property bearing the Hilton brand name, while the other will be a 320-room business hotel under the Hilton Garden Inn brand.

 The service apartments will also sport a Hilton tag Homewood Suite.

 We believe there is scope for all three properties to prosper. So, all of them will be built and launched simultaneously, added Basak. 

 Hilton, catering to the leisure traveller, is the best known of the Hilton Hotel Corporation brands. There are about 500 Hilton hotels across the globe. Hilton Garden Inn is aimed at the business traveller and is moderately priced. There are over 250 such hotels in north America.

 Homewood Suite is an upscale service apartment brand, targeting executives coming to a city for a long stay. The DLF plans to set up 100 service apartments in Calcutta.

 Emmar-MGF consortium of Dubai is also building a five-star property close to ITC Sonar Bangla, while Intercontinental will build a hotel at Rajarhat.

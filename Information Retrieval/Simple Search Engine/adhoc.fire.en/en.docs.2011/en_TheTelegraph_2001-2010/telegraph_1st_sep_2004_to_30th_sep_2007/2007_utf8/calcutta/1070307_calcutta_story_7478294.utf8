The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Traffic police guide for a good drive 

 - Sections on one-way street, no-parking zone, penalty, registration, licence, insurance and guard

 KINSUK BASU 

 Do you know the penalty for crossing the white line on the road? Or that there is a fine for playing your car stereo too loud? Are you aware of the roads that are one-way till 2 pm? Have you violated rules by modifying your vehicle?

 A book on all things traffic is Calcutta Polices latest endeavour to sort out the mess on the road. The guide, meant for drivers in the city, will contain road rules, tips for safe driving and addresses and phone numbers of traffic guards in Calcutta.

 The book should be useful for those who want to find out about road restrictions, no-parking zones, vehicle registration and insurance. The material is ready, except for a few inputs, said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim. 

 Data on parking zones is currently being collated from the civic headquarters, revealed an officer in the traffic department. The book is expected to be published in one-and-a-half month.

 The book will begin with simple tips on driving in Calcutta, followed by a section on what makes a good driver and the documents that must be there in a car. Over 10-plus chapters, it will provide an exhaustive list of one-way roads and lanes and no-parking zones, as well as of the types of traffic offences and the penalties they attract.

 Many motorists dont know the basics, like how to drive around islands or offences that will be held against them. The book will throw light on these key aspects of traffic management, said a senior traffic police officer. 

 According to the plan, the guide will be distributed among government departments and traffic guards.

 We are yet to decide whether to set a price for the book or not. The idea is to ensure that motorists actually read the guide. We may distribute the book through the offices of the public vehicles department, said another officer of the department.

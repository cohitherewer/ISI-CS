The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Guest screen at hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The condition of Bhanumati who has spent 39 years in bed no. 9 of Howrah Orthopaedic Hospital remained the same on Friday. 

 The only change was in the behaviour of the hospital authorities, who screened visitors to the female ward, following the report published in Metro on Thursday.

 Her mother Sitamani Devi said she found her daughter in tears on Friday afternoon, when she went to the hospital to feed her. A nurse had threatened her daughter, the mother alleged. Why dont you die and save us all the trouble? the nurse had screamed.

 Bela Devi, 58, a peon at Eastern Railways Koilaghat office, said: I knew the family from 1966. And I know Bhanumati was a healthy girl, who used to play all day, before she was taken to the hospital.

 The Eastern Railway authorities failed to come up with an explanation on the plight of Bhanumati and evaded queries.

 When contacted, divisional railway manager A.K. Maitra passed the buck to chief health director Ashok Kumar Saha. He decided to reserve his comments on the negligence charge. 

 The post of the chief public relations officer of the railway is currently vacant, after the transfer of Soumitra Majumdar. Senior public relations officer Samir Goswami could not be contacted as he is recuperating in a city hospital.

 Basudeb Acharya, chairman, railway standing committee, said: I will ask the railway authorities to conduct an inquiry .

 An agreement for a one-year bridge course signed with a UAE institute to reorient Indian paramedical and nursing graduates to upgrade their skills, promises to have a far-reaching impact on the healthcare delivery scenario in Calcutta and its adjoining areas.

 The pact was inked by Narayana Health Academy, an associate of Narayana Hrudayalaya, Bangalore, with Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT), UAE, to train technically skilled manpower in the area of healthcare, medical, paramedical and nursing for requirement in the West.

 Most hospitals in the Gulf have a very high standard of healthcare delivery, to which a good number of Indian trained medical and paramedical staff do not comply. In the process, they end up having less responsibilities and remuneration, says Devi Shetty, chairman, Narayana Hrudayalaya (NH), Bangalore and Asia Heart Foundation (AHF), Calcutta, which runs the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) in Mukundapur, off the Bypass.

 Shetty, who signed the agreement with Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, chancellor of HCT and minister of education of the UAE recently, feels the year-long bridge course and HCT certification will help Indians occupy higher positions in the West Asian healthcare and in other countries. Both AHF and NH have pledged to create campuses in their proposed health cities to accommodate thousands of youngsters from rural Bengal and Karnataka, interested in pursuing careers in the healthcare sector.

 The Calcutta Health City, with 5,000 beds and a projected outpatient visit of 20,000 patients a day, will be an excellent avenue for training thousands of youngsters in the area of medical, nursing and paramedical specialities, adds Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, clinical director of RTIICS. The Health City is set to come up near the Mukundapur hospital.

 With the affiliation to HCT, we will be able to give a broader outlook to our youngsters, who can look at global opportunities in spite of their rural background, he says.

 Shetty cites the general affluence in Kerala and puts it down to its investment in education, mainly for the girl child, which helps them find well-paying jobs in the medical field in the West.

 Nursing is the only profession in the world where a girl from a village at the age of 24 can earn Rs 1.5 lakh a month by becoming a charge nurse in any of the major hospitals of the US, Europe or West Asia, he stresses.

 The cardiac surgeon adds Kerala has one of the largest numbers of workers in healthcare in the West, remitting millions to their state every month, triggering the massive development in rural Kerala.

 The Bengal government is also in the process of increasing the number of medical and paramedical courses by creating a dedicated university for medical education.

 At AHF, we are committed to healthcare education to train technically skilled manpower for global requirement. This is the best way Indian hospitals can have an extremely skilled healthcare workforce as well as create millions of jobs in this field, feels Raghuvanshi.

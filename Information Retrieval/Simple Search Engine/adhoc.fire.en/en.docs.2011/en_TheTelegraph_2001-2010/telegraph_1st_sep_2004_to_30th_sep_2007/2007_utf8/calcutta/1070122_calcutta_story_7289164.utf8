 KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR

 Yuvraj Singh, in 

 town for The Telegraph Twenty20, at CC amp;FC on Saturday.

 I felt pretty good out there, 

 is how star bat and stylebhai Yuvraj Singh described Day 

 3 of The Telegraph Twenty20 cricket tournament at 

 CC amp;FC. Yuvi may have scored just 5 runs, but feeling 

 good out in the middle is the first sign of a successful 

 comeback after injury.

 Seated near the swimming pool 

 at CC amp;FC and between mouthfuls of rice and chicken, 

 the man of few words spoke to GoodLife on fashion, 

 Bollywood, Bigg Boss and, of course, cricket.

 Fashion 

 facts: One couldnt miss the Reebok logo on the 

 brand ambassadors T-shirt. Dressed in jeans, 

 T-shirt and chappals is how you would usually find me. Im 

 a shopaholic on tours but I dont shop much in India, 

 he said.

 His favourite cologne is Allure 

 by Chanel. The craziest thing hes done is drive 

 rashly in school days, which explains his most expensive 

 buy a BMW M3.

 Star pick: Talking of Bollywood, 

 the cricketer picks Abhishek Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan 

 as his favourite stars. Kajol was a favourite too, 

 but I dont get to see her on screen anymore, 

 he smiled.

 Career call: The son of 

 fast bowler, then actor, Yograj Singh is very sure that 

 the silver screen does not feature anywhere in his future 

 plans. Politics is ruled out, too. I am not interested 

 in politics because, firstly, I am not a good speaker. And 

 then there are other reasons... Games is my passion. I am 

 quite sporty. If I werent a cricketer, I would be 

 into some other sport.

 Comeback time: Its 

 great to see Sourav (Ganguly) back in the team. But hes 

 not the only one who has dropped out and joined back. Me, 

 (Mohammed) Kaif a lot of us have been there. When you are 

 dropped, you need to push yourself hard, feels Yuvraj.

 Keep fit: The rough-and-tough 

 player prescribes an early and light meal at night 

 for the health-conscious. What you eat at night is 

 very important. I restrict myself when I need to when I 

 feel Im putting on weight. Of course, regular workouts 

 are a must, he adds.

 Reality bites: The sporting 

 hero has managed to catch a few episodes of the reality 

 show Bigg Boss. Its good fun. You have 

 to be streetsmart if youre in there, which Im 

 not. Im sure Ill be thrown out in a day! 

 he laughed. I wouldnt mind going in for a day 

 though, added the fun-loving Saggitarian.

 City speak: I come 

 to Calcutta rarely. The night life is good here and people 

 are well-behaved, said Yuvraj, who was seen partying 

 at Shisha and Roxy this weekend.

 Beyond the boundary line: 

 And what does he do when hes not playing cricket? 

 Im talking to the media! pat came the 

 reply. (No missing the disarming grin.)

 Waiting for the World Cup: 

 Ask him about his chances of being part of Team India 

 in the Cup and the straight drive is stinging: 100 

 per cent.

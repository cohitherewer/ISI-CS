 Parents grapple with son

 over grandchild

 - Septuagenarians accuse their first-born of rejecting girl child, fight for custody of three-year-old 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 We know our son. She cannot be happy with him. She is our child. If she is snatched from us, we will die.

 The petitioners: Grandparents Nanigopal Dey, 78, and Bina Dey, 72.

 The son: Sanjib.

 The child: Adwitiya, 3.

 In a letter to Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar, the Deys of Malda have pleaded with the court to save their granddaughter from her father their eldest son.

 Sanjib, a railway magistrate in Howrah, became a father three years back. Nanigopal and Bina Dey allege that Sanjib and his wife refused to accept the girl child as they wanted a son.

 From that day, we have raised Adwitiya. Our lives have revolved around her. She has never left our side for three years and we will not allow her to go to people who rejected her because she was a girl, wrote Nanigopal Dey, a retired government employee.

 While her parents stayed on in Howrah, little Adwitiya grew up at her grandparents home in Jhaljhalia, Malda. A year back, when Adwitiya was two years old, Sanjib started visiting his parents regularly and building a bond with his daughter.

 What had changed? Sanjibs wife had given birth to a son. We know our son; he just wants his daughter back so that she can help them look after the son. So we refused to hand her over to him, wrote Adwitiyas grandparents.

 On June 3, Sanjib dropped in when his parents were not home. When they returned, they realised he had left with Adwitiya. We immediately lodged a complaint with Jhaljhalia thana against our son, they wrote.

 Now, the grandparents are desperate to save their precious grandchild from the clutches of her parents. Till the other day, he (Sanjib) refused to even acknowledge her existence because she was a girl child. Now he wants her back just because it suits him. They only want to exploit her and make her take care of the baby boy, alleged Dey (sr).

 Labelling him selfish and cruel, the Deys wrote how Sanjib had been pampered by them in his childhood, far more than his two younger brothers. And last year, he took away a lot of cash and jewellery from us. We dont want anything back, we just want him to hand over Adwitiya to us, pleaded the septuagenarians.

 Referring to the three-year-old as our child, Nanigopal Dey wrote: Adwitiya is our lifeline. We will die if she is not returned to us.

 What does the letter of the law say? Parents are the legal custodians of their children, but in this case her grandparents have brought up the child since her birth. If the allegations by the petitioners prove true, the court will decide where the child will be happy. The court has the discretion to allow the grandparents to raise the child, said Joyanta Narayan Chatterjee, advocate of Calcutta High Court.

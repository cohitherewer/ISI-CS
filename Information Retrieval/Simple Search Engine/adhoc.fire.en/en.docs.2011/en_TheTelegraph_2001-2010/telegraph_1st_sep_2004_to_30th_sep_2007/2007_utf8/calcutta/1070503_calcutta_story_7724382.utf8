 Of imagination and reality

 Few artists possess the rare aesthetic virtue of bringing together the material and the ideal world on a single plane. Thus, Focus Five, featuring a remarkable collection of realistic yet magical works by five upcoming photographers, is of special interest to all connoisseurs of the visual arts. The photographs of Subrata Das range from tabletops to undefined shapes, encompassing his vision of a universe where reality and fantasy co-exist. Somnath Ghoshs creative brilliance shines through in his surrealistic approach to photography. Surajit Hari (a photograph by him appears right) captures the very essence of nature with works of enchanting beauty. Subhas Dutta pays tribute to his birthplace Calcutta through images that reveal his passionate obsession for the city. The photographs of Amlan Dutta create a unique, amazing bond between sublimity and simplicity.

 Event: An exhibition of works by five photographers When: Till May 5; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Gaganendra Shilpa Pradarshashala

 Dummy held in test scam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Patna Medical College student Biswajit Sawarna was arrested on Thursday for allegedly appearing in the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) as a dummy candidate.

 Biswajit stood first in the ayurveda entrance examination in Bihar in 2004. The next year, he topped the medical entrance examination in the state. He was arrested by Calcutta polices detective department before the second paper of his first professional MBBS exam.

 According to the police, Biswajit took the state JEE for a candidate named Avijit Saha from Malda and secured a rank of 131. Avijit waited outside the examination centre at Garia as Biswajit wrote the test. He returned to Patna the same day. 

 Mihir Jha, a JEE racket kingpin, contacted Biswajit directly and persuaded him to appear as a dummy. Jha had taken Rs 3 lakh from the Sahas. We are yet to find out how much Biswajit was paid, said city detective chief Ajoy Kumar.

 It appears that Biswajit had appeared as a dummy candidate at other medical entrance examinations, including one in Uttar Pradesh, he added. 

 The third among the five sons of Ram Bahadur Kumar, Biswajit had cleared his secondary exam from Model High School in Bhagalpur in 2001 and then cleared his Plus II from Purnea district high school. His father founded a girls school in Purnea and is a respected man, said an investigator. 

 Biswajit was produced in court on Friday and remanded in police custody for a week. The number of people arrested in the JEE scam now stands at 21.

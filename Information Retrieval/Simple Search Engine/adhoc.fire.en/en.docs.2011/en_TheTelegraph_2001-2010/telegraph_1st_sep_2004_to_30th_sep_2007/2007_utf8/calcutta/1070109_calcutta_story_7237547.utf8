The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Weather the 

 desert storm

 Screen On amp; Off

 Cashing in: A moment 

 from Zaara: Pyaar Ki Saugat 

 Amidst all the controversies 

 and complications, Ashutosh Gowarikers Jodha Akbar 

 rolls on. Even as the Rajput Mahasabha is planning to sue 

 Ashutosh and his team, the big-budget Hrithik Roshan-Aishwarya 

 Rai-starrer has completed its first schedule in Rajasthan.

 The controversy surrounding the 

 UTV production lies in the debate that Jodha was actually 

 Mughal emperor Jehangirs wife and not Akbars, as Ashutoshs 

 film is trying to portray. While Narender Singh Rajawat, 

 president of Rajput Mahasabha, is preparing to send legal 

 notices to Team Jodha Akbar, Ashutosh is confident 

 of his research and claims to have even verified all his 

 facts with direct descendants of Jodha Bai.

 Jodha Akbar is being billed 

 as a 16th century love story about a marriage of alliance 

 that gave birth to true love between a great Mughal emperor, 

 Akbar, and a Rajput princess, Jodha.

 Meanwhile, with the completion 

 of the 60-day Rajasthan schedule, Ashutoshs team returned 

 to Mumbai on December 30. Besides Jaipur, the film was shot 

 in various other locations of the states and some vital 

 war scenes were shot involving Hrithik Roshan playing Akbar. 

 The second schedule of Jodha 

 Akbar started on Monday at ND Studios in Karjat, a two-hour 

 drive from Mumbai, which will conclude the principal filming 

 of the film. Jodha Akbar is slated for a Diwali 2007 

 release.

 Zaraa hatke 

 It happens only in India, and 

 on Indian television. Families that send children to the 

 US for higher studies also choose the path of a second marriage 

 for their childless son. The hapless wife calls upon her 

 younger sister to make up the nuptial triangle and stave 

 off a stranger of a souten. The twists in the storyline 

 are raking in the TRPs for Sahara Ones new serial Zaraa: 

 Pyaar Ki Saugat, beamed at 8 pm. The added dimension 

 is the Muslim backdrop. Zaraa, as the makers point 

 out, is the first Muslim story on the small screen since 

 the successful run of Sonys Heena in 2002-2003. 

 It is the tale of a girl next 

 door who is called upon to make the sacrifice after her 

 elder sister fails to conceive after four years of marriage, 

 says director Pawan Sahu.

 The Muslim backdrop is being utilised 

 to the hilt. The curtains went up on an Id party this December. 

 The women wear elaborate zardosi and nakshkari 

 work on shimmering silks and chiffons. The sets reflect 

 architectural artistry, including an elaborately erected 

 dargah. The dialogues are rich in Urdu. Another clincher 

 is its Sufi music by Kailash Kher. 

 With positive viewer response 

 in the first couple of weeks, producer Binaifer S. Kohli 

 is ecstatic. Samar (Zaraas heartthrob, played by Abhay 

 Vakil) is being compared to Salman Khan of Hum Dil De 

 Chuke Sanam for his dashing looks. And people loved 

 the episode where the mature Aamir (Zaraas brother-in-law 

 and proposed groom) weeps at the dargah. I told him that 

 he looks good in tears, she trills about her metrosexual 

 lead man Jatin Grewal. 

 The makers refuse to accept the 

 portrayal of bigamy as a way out of childlessness to be 

 regressive. Adoption is out of the question as under Muslim 

 law, the child cannot take the fathers name. And as for 

 the serials women, being tolerant is not being regressive. 

 Hasnt Gandhiji told us to offer the other cheek 

 if we are slapped on one? And female foeticide is still 

 a social reality. Tolerance is the inner strength of women 

 in keeping the family together, Kohli counters.

 Sahu, who has earlier directed 

 Sindoor and Vaidehi, knows what counts: At 

 the end of the day, if the story is good, only then will 

 the audience watch. So far, the audience is happy to be 

 watching.

 Period pause: Hrithik 

 Roshan

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gizmos take it on the chin

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Arup Raha urgently needed to withdraw Rs 10,000 from the neighbourhood ATM on Wednesday afternoon. But the incessant rain had rendered the ATM inoperative.

 There are several like Raha in this waterlogged city who have been left severely short of cash.

 Some of our ATMs in Jadavpur are not working. As for the rest, we are trying our best to keep them operational, said an official of State Bank of India.

 He admitted that too much of rain disrupts the link among the ATMs, rendering them defunct.

 Some other banks, too, are facing the problem. We had to close down an ATM in Behala, one of most waterlogged pockets in the city, to avoid electrocution and other hazards, said a representative of HDFC Bank. 

 The bank has more than 90 ATMs in the city.

 People carrying laptops and cellphones are facing problems, with water seeping into the gadgets.

 Cellphone service has taken a beating, with customers complaining of not being able to get through to the numbers dialled. The rate of call drops (the line getting disconnected while talking) has also risen significantly. 

 Cellphone service providers across the world face the problem of reduction in amplitude and intensity of the signal during bad weather. This causes a deterioration in the service, said a BSNL official.

 Business process outsourcing units, too, have been severely affected by the downpour.

 Work suffers in this situation if a company does not have multiple Internet service providers. The problem compounds when water seeps into underground cables or an overhead tower is struck by lightning, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris Business Solutions Pvt Ltd, a BPO.

 Voice BPOs suffer more than non-voice outfits. The time taken for a server to interpret data, or voice, and transmit back to the receiver is usually 200 milliseconds. But during rain, it can shoot up to 500 milliseconds, said an industry expert.

 The local area network (LAN) lines, however, seem to have fared better, as the recently-laid fibre optic cables are more water resistant than the old copper links.

 The bridge connecting Garia with the rest of south Calcutta is ready but cannot be opened to the public because of opposition from the local autorickshaw drivers. The bridge also serves as the citys gateway to the Sunderbans.

 About 200 autos that ply on the Garia-Sonarpur and Garia-Baruipur routes are parked on a slope of the bridge. The drivers want alternative parking arrangements to be made before they shift elsewhere.

 Where will we go unless the government makes arrangements for us? We have to provide for our families by plying autos. Moreover, the services are important for people who travel beyond Garia, said Sunil Paik, an auto driver. 

 The original Garia bridge was built in 1901 by a Scottish company. In 1997, a new bridge was built beside it to cope with increased traffic. The flank was inaugurated by then chief minister Jyoti Basu. The original bridge was demolished in August 2005 for reconstruction. 

 Nearly 2,000 autos, buses on more than a dozen routes, taxis and rickshaws now use the open flank of the bridge. A part of it is occupied by hawkers. As a result, it takes nearly half-an-hour to cover a few metres. Sometimes, office-goers and schoolchildren have to cross the stretch on foot to save time. Those on their way to Sonarpur, Baruipur and the Sunderbans are often forced to take a detour through the EM Bypass.

 We finished work on the bridge more than a week ago and have sent a completion letter to the district magistrate. We are not aware when it will be opened, said chief executive engineer of the irrigation department Goutam Chatterjee. District magistrate of South 24-Parganas Roshni Sen said she had not received any such letter.

 According to Susanta Guha, a member of South 24-Parganas Auto Rickshaw Operators Union, the matter should be resolved through talks. We will soon meet officials of the irrigation department, public works department and Metro Railway and members of Brihattar Garia Unnayan Committee for a solution, he said. 

 Local CPM councillor, borough chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and executive member of the union Batakrishna Roy said it would be not difficult to make an alternative parking arrangement for the autorickshaws. We have shortlisted a few sites. We hope the difficulties of the commuters comes to an end soon, he said.

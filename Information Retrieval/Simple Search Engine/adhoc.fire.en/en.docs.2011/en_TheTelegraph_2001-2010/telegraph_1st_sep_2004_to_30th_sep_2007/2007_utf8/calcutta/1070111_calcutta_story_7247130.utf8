 Musical Return: Madhuri 

 Dixit

 There has been a lot of speculation 

 about Madhuri Dixits comeback film in Bollywood. The Telegraph had broken the news that the screen legend would actually 

 return in a Yash Raj Films production to be directed by 

 National Award-winning cinematographer Anil Mehta, who has 

 shot films like Lagaan and Saathiya.

 While the official launch will happen shortly, heres more on the project. The film is tentatively titled Aa Nachle and according to sources is about a theatre group headed by Madhuris character. Playing actors in that group are Ranvir Shorey and Konkona Sen Sharma. Also slated to do an important role in the film is Kunal Kapoor.

 The other buzz doing the rounds is that Aa Nachle is actually a remake of Sound of Music with Madhuri doing a Julie Andrews. The actress, who is currently in Mumbai, is reportedly trying to lose some last-minute kilos to look as light as possible having maintained its difficult to look beautiful after delivering two babies.

 Yash Raj, like always, is keeping everything under wraps and letting everyone speculate. As for Mehta, he is just overjoyed to work with the once numero uno Bollywood heroine. The best thing about it is that I have never even shot Madhuri in a film, so it would be just great on the sets, he told Metro.

 Emmy Edge: A moment from 

 Into the West

 On Thursday night, STAR Movies will present an exclusive mini-series which was the most Emmy-nominated programme of the year in the United States with a record 16 Emmy nominations in 2005. Into the West, produced by Steven Spielberg and Dreamworks, stars Matthew Settle, Josh Brolin, Tonantzin Carmelo and Gary Busey.

 An epic tale of two figures during the American colonisation of the west, Into the West is about one white and one native American. Jacob Wheeler (Matthew Settle) leaves his dull life behind to go west, while Loved By the Buffalo (Joseph M. Marshall III) faces his destiny to try and fight a prophecy that his people will be wiped out by the settlers. Jacob marries Loved By the Buffalos sister Thunder Heart Woman, uniting the two families while around them relations between the two races crumble. 

 The story intertwines real and fictional characters and events spanning the period of expansion of the United States in the American West, from 1825 to 1890.

 Tune in to Into the West on Thursday at 9 pm on STAR Movies.

 Next Monday will see the launch of Zee TVs first daily soap of the New Year.

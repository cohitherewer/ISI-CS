 A pay-and-use toilet has come up along the boundary wall of the oldest church in Howrah, which also houses a school. Lagan Deo Singh, CPM legislator of Howrah (north), funded the project.

 Our Lady of the Happy Voyage church is situated opposite Howrah station, next to Howrah Hotel. It was built in 1831, before Howrah station and Howrah bridge came into being.

 In 1845, a school was started on the premises. The institution is now known as St Aloysius School and has a student strength of more than 1,200 boys.

 The boundary wall of the school was being used as a urinal. Thousands would relieve themselves there, spoiling the church godown. The urine would flow down to the primary section on the ground floor. The entire area would stink all day. Many parents approached us with the problem. To make matters worse, the authorities have legalised the practice by setting up a pay-and-use toilet, said Father Moloy DCosta, principal of the school.

 The church is situated near a bus terminus. Thousands of people who visit the terminus and Howrah station use the toilet. We have complained to everyone from the local councillor to the mayor but no action has been taken, stated Father DCosta.

 When contacted by Metro, Singh said: Thousands visit the bus terminus every day. Where will they go to relieve themselves? We will clean the toilet daily with phenyl so that the school is not disturbed.

 The municipal commissioner could not recall any complaint in this regard. We get so many complaints that I cant recall any specific one lodged by the church authorities, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Food park boon for tech town

 - 24x7 meal stop will offer Bengali delicacies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Coming up: A food park in Salt Lake Sector V. 

 Around 60 per cent of the space will be earmarked for techies in the IT hub to have wholesome meals, while the rest will be reserved for conferences and allied activities.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has struck a deal with a private company to set up the one-stop-food-shop in DN block to meet a long-standing demand from professionals in the hub. To remain open 24x7, the food park will offer Bengali delicacies and also the cuisine of north, east and south India. 

 The three-storeyed building will come up on 15 cottahs and is likely to be ready in a year. The ground floor will be used as a car park.

 Work will begin soon. The building will be given to the private company on lease for 99 years, said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of the CMDA. The department had sought tenders from companies with experience in setting up food parks or similar projects.

 Given the demand from the software industry, it was necessary to put in place a food court that would be operational round-the-clock. After studying the models in Bangalore and Noida, we decided to set up two food parks in Sector V. Unfortunately, only one is coming up now, said a senior official of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which looks after the civic affairs of Sector V.

 Sources said the other facility was to be set up on the premises of the Nalban waterbody. It has been put on hold, following objections raised by the fisheries department on technical grounds.

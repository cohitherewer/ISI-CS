The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fine tuner of grand pianos 

 Calcuttan Of The Week 

 Name: Sisir Das

 Who is he? The oldest piano-tuner in the city. 

 Initial days: Das (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya) started out in the footsteps of his father, working as a jeweller till his uncles, who were piano-tuners, introduced him to the art of tuning and repairing pianos. That was more than 60 years ago. Now 76, he trained for nearly five years at Hobbs and Company, opposite Great Eastern Hotel. He was then asked by Francis Braganza of Braganza and Company, a popular music shop on Marquis Street, to join his shop. 

 At present: That is where the lean old man has been since 1952, adjusting the pitch and tone of keys to help pianists make great music. Earlier, Id also tune pedal organs. They are obsolete now, Das says. Das can tune and fix all three types of pianos grand, cottage or mini of German or English make. I tried learning the piano long ago from a music teacher called Mr Menezes for more than a year, but gave up, smiles Das, clad in a white dhoti. He travels every day from his home in Sonarpur to Braganzas workshop. 

 Musical memories: The joy of travel drew Das to this profession. I have been to Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Nainital, Assam, Darjeeling, Delhi and Chennai. Michael Swiss, a pianist, once took me all the way to Nepal to repair a piano at the German Consulate, says Das who is often called to missionary schools in the country. He can be spotted at most of the musical dos in the city including the ones at Calcutta School of Music, Max Mueller Bhavan, Gorky Sadan and GD Birla Sabhagar. I was also there keeping an eye on the piano at the Jazz Festival at Dalhousie Institute earlier this year, he gushes. Das has tuned pianos for Satyajit Ray, V. Balsara, Adi Gazdar, Sam Engineer, Kabir Suman and Sumit Roy. 

 Where are the piano tuners? Nobody comes to me to learn how to tune a piano. So I go out to train younger generations, says Das, who has introduced both his son and grandson to the art. 

 These days electronic keyboards are more popular since theyre handy. Perhaps that is why not too many people are interested in piano-tuning, he says.

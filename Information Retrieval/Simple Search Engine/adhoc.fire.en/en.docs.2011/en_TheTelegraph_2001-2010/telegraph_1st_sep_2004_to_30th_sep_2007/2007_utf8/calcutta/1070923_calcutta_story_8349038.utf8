 Tales of Ray

 Father Gaston Roberge, a French-Canadian priest who had lived many years in the city, had complete admiration for Satyajit Ray and his films. He also knew Ray closely as a person. During the 1970s, Fr Roberge had written several pieces on Rays films, as well as personal accounts. 

 These have been compiled into a book titled Satyajit Ray, published by Manohar Publishers. Rays wife Bijoya released the book at her residence on September 11. It was launched at St Xaviers College on Thursday. 

 I used to visit Manikda every Sunday at 9am. The book is biographical, especially the Apu trilogy part. To an extent, I have grown up with Apu, said Fr Roberge.

 He had given Ray a book on church music. Not many have noticed that in Shakha Proshakha there is a Greek song O God have mercy on us. Later I gave him a book with the same song. Although he was an agnostic, he kept the book in his drawer. That was a touching moment for me.

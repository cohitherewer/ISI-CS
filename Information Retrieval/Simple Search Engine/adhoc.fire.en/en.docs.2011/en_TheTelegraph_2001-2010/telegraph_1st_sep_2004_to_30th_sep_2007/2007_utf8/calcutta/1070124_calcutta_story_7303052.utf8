 In the Wednesday episode of the new Kaun Banega Crorepati, Shah Rukh Khan will go Haryanvi. After Bengali and Telugu during the first day, first show on Monday night, SRK shows his proficiency in Haryanvi as he welcomes Mohit Mahipal from Hissar.

 To make Mohit comfortable, SRK chats with him about his kid and wife and also urges him to translate I love you in Haryanvi.

 Mohit declares that he will give all the cash he wins on the show to his mother. Mohits friend on the sets is Vinay Gupta who points out that he wants 50 per cent of the prize money in case Mohit wins.

 After Mohit loses out, SRK plays Fastest Finger First with a fresh set of contestants and Vinayak Karan from Hyderabad makes it to the hot seat.

 The new hot seat occupant wants to buy a Golden Bed if he wins Rs 2 crore. Vinayak rolls over to the Republic Day special episode on Thursday because of lack of time.

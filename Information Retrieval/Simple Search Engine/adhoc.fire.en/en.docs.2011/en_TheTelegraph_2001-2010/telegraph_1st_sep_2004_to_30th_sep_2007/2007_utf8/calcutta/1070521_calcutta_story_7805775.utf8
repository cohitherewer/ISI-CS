The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Missing, two kids a day

 - Parental or academic pressure fans runaway streak in children

 KINSUK BASU

 Ten-year-old Obidur Rehman went missing on May 1. His family had hoped that the child would return in a day or two, but there is no trace yet of the Topsia Second Lane resident.

 Similar is the fate of several other children most of them in their teens of the city. 

 Welcome to a city where children go missing almost every day, most of whom never return. According to figures available with police, at least 18 children up to 18 years of age went missing from April 26 to May 3 (a little over two a day). Of them, nine had gone missing between May 1 and 3.

 As many as 66 children went missing in March, though quite a few returned.

 Why are city children disappearing in such large numbers? The police claim several of these kids are running away from home to escape academic or parental pressure, or simply to seek freedom.

 On April 30, for instance, a Class VII student of a government school in north Calcutta went missing soon after the results of the annual exams were out. He had failed.

 The boy, a resident of Raja Manindra Road, returned from Mumbai a few days later, but the same day, we recorded another missing case, of a nine-year-old student, said a police officer.

 A logic seems to be at work. Adolescents who are unable to cope with parental pressure opt for freedom. While some kids revolt, others run away from home, said psychiatrist Ranadip Ghosh Roy.

 Children from a poor economic background often fall prey to promises of jobs from touts. The younger ones, at times, end up as domestic help in Bihar, Delhi or down South, said an officer.

 In 2006, at least 623 children had gone missing from the city, a shade less than the previous years figure (763).

 The issue is of serious concern, but the figures can be misleading, as we are generally not informed when the missing children return, said detective chief Gyanwant Singh.

 Rattled by the trend, the police had initiated a survey in 2006 to identify the areas from where the maximum number of children went missing. 

 The survey identified Narkeldanga, Maniktala, Ekbalpore, Karaya, Garden Reach and Chitpur as the most vulnerable areas.

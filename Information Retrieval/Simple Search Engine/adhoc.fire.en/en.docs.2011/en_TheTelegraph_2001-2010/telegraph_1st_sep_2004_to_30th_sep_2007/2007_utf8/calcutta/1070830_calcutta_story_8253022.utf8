 A call-centre employee who allegedly tried to molest a model on a crowded Metro Railway train was caught by passengers at Sovabazar station on Wednesday evening. He was later arrested.

 Mousumi Roy, 25, was returning to her Lake Town home after a shoot at Tollygunge. She was sitting next to the door of a coach.

 When the train was approaching Sovabazar station around 7.05pm, a young man moved close to Mousumis seat. He allegedly fondled her and then, as the train came to a stop at the station, made a grab at her before getting off and melting into the crowd.

 Mousumi was to get off at Belgachhia, but she decided to hit back. She jumped out of the compartment and shouted to the other passengers to stop the man. One of them tried but the youth pushed him to the floor and tried to run up the stairs to the station exit.

 A group of passengers alerted by the womans cries overpowered the man on the stairs and then handed him over to the Metro Railway Protection Force (RPF).

 The man identified himself as Arijit Sen and claimed to be 24 years old. He also said he was a resident of Salt Lakes AD block, said Sandip Mukherjee, a government employee from Sarat Bose Road, who helped stop the youth.

 Mousumi then lodged a complaint with Sovabazar station manager A.C. Biswas.

 Following the rule book, the Metro RPF registered a case and then handed him over to the police, said Biswas.

 Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh said late on Wednesday that based on the complaint, Sen had been arrested.

 Sales executive Avik Deb, another passenger who stopped Sen, said: I travel daily by Metro and often see such incidents. We could help the girl and catch the offender because she protested.

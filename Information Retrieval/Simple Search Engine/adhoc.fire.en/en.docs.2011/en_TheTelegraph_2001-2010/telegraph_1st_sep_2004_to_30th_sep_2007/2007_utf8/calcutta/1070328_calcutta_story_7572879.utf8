 Higher education for all

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With factors like caste, religion, ethnicity and gender forcing exclusion of certain sections of students from higher education, policy planners must intervene to ensure equal opportunities for all. 

 The consensus emerged during Day One of a two-day policy-level dialogue between Indian and British academicians at ITC Sonar Bangla on Tuesday.

 We need to reserve seats to compensate for past injustices, said UGC chairman Sukhdeo Thorat, while speaking on Widening Access and Social Inclusion in Higher Education. We should also draw in students from backward areas into research, rather than focus on those from privileged backgrounds, he added.

 The policy-level dialogue, organised under the banner of UK-India Education and Research Initiative, was also attended by National Knowledge Commission vice-chairman P.M. Bhargava and Greg Boone, policy team leader, department of education and skills, UK.

 From privatisation of educational institutions to reservation for underprivileged, some of the most hotly-debated issues came up during the discussion. 

 Education at the school level should be free. As long as money remains the basis for ensuring quality education, we cannot produce quality manpower to contribute to progress, observed Bhargava. 

 J.B. Tilak of National University for Education Planning and Administration spoke on how educational expenses were increasing even at the secondary level.

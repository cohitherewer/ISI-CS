The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Neighbours up in arms

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The news of Siddhartha Palodhis arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department for allegedly murdering his four-year-old adopted son Ganesh in December 2004 had Bauria, in Howrah, astir on Monday. The Palodhis lived there at the time of the murder. 

 While most local residents expressed shock, some put up a road blockade and attacked the residence of a relative of Siddhartha.

 Eight young residents of the area had been picked up by police and tortured. They were ostracised after being released, said Soumen Ghosh, a resident of the area. He, along with his neighbours, blocked Domjur Road, near the three-storeyed Kalyani Bhavan, where the Palodhis stayed.

 Among the protesters were six of the eight persons arrested following Ganeshs disappearance on December 3, 2004. The boys decomposed body was found in a drain behind Kalyani Bhavan on December 21. The Palodhis moved from the area soon after.

 A group of residents later raided the residence of Siddharthas brother-in-law Ganapati Gangopadhyay, who lives next to Kalyani Bhavan. Gangopadhyay had a hand in the crime, alleged Ghosh. 

 Gangopadhyay, an advocate in the high court, said: Only my two daughters were in the house when it was attacked. They were abused.

 I never liked that man (Siddhartha). After a few drinks, he would change into a rude and foul-mouthed beast. Besides, he was growing rich far too quickly, said Barun Kha, a resident of Trisha Villa, adjacent to Kalyani Bhavan.

 Siddhartha owned a sawmill in front of his house, where he used to hold drinking sessions with his friends at night, claimed Mohammad Saddik, who owns a bedding store in the area. 

 Ganesh was a lovely boy. He used to ride a bicycle near my shop. I had scolded him several times for trying to cycle on the busy Domjur Road. I saw him cycling even on the day he went missing, recounted Saddik.

 We have set up a picket near Kalyani Bhavan, said Sandip Kumar Dinda, an officer of Bauria police station.

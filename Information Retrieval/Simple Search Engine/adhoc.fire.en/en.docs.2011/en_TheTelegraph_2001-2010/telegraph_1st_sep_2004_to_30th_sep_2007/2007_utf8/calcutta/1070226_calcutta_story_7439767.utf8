 Skin bank need stressed

 SUBHRO SAHA

For rapid and efficient treatment of burns victims, Bengal needs a skin bank at the earliest to facilitate cadaveric transplants, state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra stressed on Sunday.

 Its one of my dreams to have a skin bank in the state, and we will extend any help to get such a facility rolling. If need be, even a modification to the cadaver transplant Act could be considered, Mishra said, while addressing a burns seminar in Barasat.

 The national symposium on Low-Cost, Efficient Burns Care Solutions and Strategies was organised by Kalpataru Hospital, a multi-speciality healthcare facility in Barasat, set up by First Trust Healthcare Pvt Ltd.

 The conclave aimed to create awareness and to provide a platform for exchange of ideas, besides officially flagging off the 10-bed Kalpataru Burns Centre, the first such private-sector unit in the state. The group is also planning to set up eastern Indias first skin bank.

 Admitting that the state hospitals struggle to cope with the sheer volume of burn injuries, the minister said it was important for the private sector to try and bring down costs wherever possible by judicious use of technology and antibiotics and by increasing bed turnover rate.

 Sunil Keswani, medical director, National Hospital for Burns Airoli, Mumbai, agreed that skin donation could make a real difference. Cadaveric skin transfer is the key. We are even doing live transfer in our skin bank and growing skin in the lab.

 With meticulous planning and proper strategy, its possible to cut costs, he maintained, a theory seconded by R. Bharat, president, National Academy of Burns. The benefits of treatment must reach the rural population. So, its important to strengthen the basic system and augment referrals, observed Bharat.

 Lauding First Trust for setting up the burns unit, he said 66 per cent of the treatment cost in burns was in manpower, the rest in antibiotics and dressing. So for most administrations, burns come low in the pecking order, much after cancer, nephrology, cardiology and other superspecialities.

 First Trust managing director Satadal Saha felt such units are necessary to complement government initiatives, while Manish Mukul Ghosh, medical director of the Kalpataru burns unit, stressed on the need to maintain records and statistics.

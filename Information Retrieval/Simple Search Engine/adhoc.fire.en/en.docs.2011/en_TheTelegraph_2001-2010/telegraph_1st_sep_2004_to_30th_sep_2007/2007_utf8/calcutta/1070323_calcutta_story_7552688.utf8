 Watching your step may not be enough to ensure safety on the cobbled pavements of the city you must also keep an eye on the sky.

 The family of Murtaza Kapadia a Class IV student of La Martiniere for Boys learnt this the hard way last Saturday. The 10-year-old boy suffered multiple injuries when a glass sheet came crashing down and landed barely a few inches from him. 

 It was a narrow escape for my son, as it could have been fatal. But the glass shards caused multiple cuts; he lost consciousness and fell down, said Mazhar Kapadia, father of Murtaza. 

 Escorted by attendant Rehmat, Murtaza was returning from school when a glass panel fell from the Exide building on the AJC Bose Road-Jawarhalal Nehru Road crossing.

 Rehmat and some pedestrians rushed Murtaza to SSKM Hospital. He was later shifted to a private clinic, as the family was not satisfied with the medical attention at the state hospital.

 He received 12 stitches in his legs and three on his head We are really worried, as he is still complaining of severe headache. The doctors have confirmed a blood clot after a CT scan, said Kapadia, a businessman, as some relatives and friends trickled into the familys Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road flat to enquire about the childs health.

 Five days have passed since the accident, but the boy under antibiotics and painkillers is still not fit enough to play with younger sister Erwa or venture out of home.

 The doctor has kept him under observation. But if the pain persists for another day, we have been advised to hospitalise him, said Kapadia, with tears in his eyes, as his son lay writhing in pain.

 On Wednesday, Kapadia went to Shakespeare Sarani police station and filed a formal complaint against Exide.

 According to Exide officials, they had also informed the police about the incident and visited SSKM Hospital.

 We rushed there to help the boy and his family. But we could not meet them and as there was no forwarding address in the hospital register, we could not contact them later, a company spokesperson told Metro. 

 Admitting that the accident took place due to glazing failure, the Exide authorities said corrective measures are being taken. We have asked JTS Gold, from whom we got the Belgian glass, to carry out an inspection. For the time being, we have stapled and fixed the other windows, explained the spokesperson.

 Police have started an investigation to ascertain the reason behind the accident. 

 We will see whether there was any negligence on the part of the owners of the building, said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.

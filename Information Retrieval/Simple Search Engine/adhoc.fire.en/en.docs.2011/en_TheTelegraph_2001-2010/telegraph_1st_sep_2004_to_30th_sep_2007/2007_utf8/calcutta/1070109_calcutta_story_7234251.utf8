 DESIGN ENVIRONMENT: The interiors of a home can relax and soothe with an eye on aesthetics. A Telegraph picture

 How can interiors reflect vernacular culture and tradition? Can home space relax and soothe with an eye on aesthetics and without burning a deep hole in the pocket? How can architecture and interior design work in tandem to create neutral workspace the end-user can customise? Can material developers and material specifiers come together to forge new possibilities? 

 Workaday posers and plausible solutions were deliberated at the first foundation day celebration of the Institute of Indian Interior Designers (IIID) Calcutta chapter last Saturday (January 6) at The Ffort Radisson, Raichak, which saw a congregation of interior designers, architects and planners from across the country and a cross-section of city professionals from different walks.

 The primary objective is to bring in a semblance of organisation in the interiors business and foster spatial imagination and consciousness among consumers to ensure meaningful use of interior space, explained architect Dulal Mukherjee, chairman of the city chapter formed a year ago.

 With a view to the advancement of the interior design profession in India, IIID was founded in 1972 in an endeavour to establish good professional and trade practices and ethics and exchange knowhow with similar organisations in other countries. 

 Today, IIID has over 3,000 members across the country with 11 chapters and four centres. While Mumbai-based architect Sen Kapadia was the guest speaker at the Raichak conclave, a panel of non-designers shared individual experiences on the design environment at an interactive session. Film-maker Ashok Viswanathan, former PCB chief Hirak Ghosh, artist-sculptor Adip Dutta, medical practitioner Tridib Banerjee and fashion designer Sunipa Samaddar all chipped in with their bites. 

 The common thread coming through was that the end-user must have more say in the design of interior space, which is in sync with IIIDs core vision, an integrated approach involving the creator and the consumer. 

 The panel also decreed that folk art and regional culture should shape interior space design, which is often forgotten in todays urban context. Instead of the disturbing modern trend where every designer in any stream is keen to leave his/her signature on the end product, what we need is the deliberate creation of a neutral workspace that can be moulded to suit the users needs, pointed out Partha Ranjan Das, vice chairman of IIID Calcutta chapter.

 Das, an architect and urban designer, stressed on the need to address the construction boom with an eye to protect the interests of the consumers by harnessing the interiors business and ushering in a professional approach with legal bindings. 

 There are many issues on design where an architects role overlaps with the brief of an interior designer. If the two can work together with a shared vision, we can create aesthetically pleasing and functionally useful interiors at a low cost, he said. 

 Mukherjee, who felt the need to kick off a Calcutta chapter of IIID after attending a conference of the International Federation of Interior Architects/Designers (IFI) in Copenhagen, agreed. At least 10 to 15 interior designers can work in a large-format real estate project. However, there is no umbrella body to bring them on one organised platform. The Calcutta chapter was established to encourage and foster ideals of the profession and promote fellowship, he observed.

 IIID is a full member of IFI and the Asia-Pacific Space Designers Association. Its mission is to consolidate and expand the contribution of the interior design profession towards improving the quality of life in contemporary and future societies by sharing knowledge and experience and understanding responsibilities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mayor points to Mumbai while Calcutta goes under water

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The weather gods showed mercy in the morning, as the maximum rainfall was recorded by the Alipore Met office between 3.30am and 8.30am.

 But the callousness of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) ensured that Calcutta remained waterlogged for the next 12 hours, till the skies opened up again.

 The outrage among victims of waterlogging could not dampen mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas spirit. There is no point in engaging in a blame game. It is but natural that streets will get waterlogged after a heavy shower and that holds true for Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore or London, argued Bhattacharyya, a practising lawyer.

 It is equally natural that the civic authorities provide adequate amenities so that the water level goes down once the rain stops, countered Subhrajit Basu, also a lawyer.

 With marooned monsoons becoming the order of 2007, Metro focuses on how the CMC has failed to deliver and what it needs to naturally do for its citizens.

 Underground sewerage

 CMC promise: The 180-km-long brick sewer will be cleaned

 Ground reality: Hardly 25 km has been cleaned till now

 Things to do:

 Penal measures for dumping

 solid waste and plastic in sewer lines

 Deployment of machines to

 clean sewer arteries

 Removing encroachments from

 surface drains

 Immediate repair of decrepit

 brick sewers.

 Dug-up roads

 CMC promise: No digging of roads in monsoon months by CMC or other agencies 

 Ground reality: Roads dug up in at least 30 key locations 

 Things to do:

 All decisions on digging

 in monsoon months should be made in CMC headquarters

 Agencies responsible for

 digging must inform the CMC after work is done

 Borough executive engineers

 (civil) must be held responsible if roads are not restored

 to original condition.

 Old pumps

 CMC promise: Complete overhaul of the 19 drainage pumping stations

 Ground reality: Blueprint of the overhaul not prepared even a year after the announcement

 Things to do: 

 Immediate replacement of

 60 of the 90 pumps in different drainage pumping stations,

 which are running at less than 30 per cent capacity

 Coordination among agencies

 CMC promise: Will make a special effort to work in synergy with the fisheries and irrigation departments

 Ground reality: lAll the 10 lock gates at Bantala were kept shut till 7am on Tuesday, which resulted in heavy waterlogging across Calcutta 

 The CMC is not happy with

 the irrigation department and CEIPs performance on re-excavation of outflow channels, which drain out water

 Things to do:

 Restoration of administrative

 control over the lock gates

 More focus and budgetary

 provision for de-silting of the choked outflow channels.

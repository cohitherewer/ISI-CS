 A 5,000-bed health city, cutting across major specialities, will come up inside the Calcutta Riverside township, the Rs 2,000-crore, 257-acre Batanagar rejuvenation project on the citys southern fringes.

 Asia Heart Foundation (AHF), a public charitable trust chaired by cardiac surgeon Devi Shetty, which will operate the health city, has entered into an agreement with Riverbank Holdings Pvt Ltd, doing the township makeover, for a cardiac hospital.

 The initial transaction is for 400 beds to be housed in a building of around 200,000 sq ft. This will be a start, and the vision is to do 5,000 beds in a phased manner, Sumit Dabriwal, managing director, Riverbank Holdings, told Metro on Monday. The company, a 50:50 joint venture between Bata India Ltd and Calcutta Metropolitan Group Ltd, has also conceptualised Calcutta Riverside.

 The health city will eventually comprise 5,000 beds in the shape of centres of excellence across the principal specialities. The first such centre of excellence will involve the cardiac discipline and will replicate our core philosophies, confirmed Shetty. He has already kicked off the Bangalore Health City in association with Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board.

 The Rs 150-crore cardiac facility at Batanagar will be functional in 14 to 15 months, felt Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, vice-chairman of AHF, which also runs the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences and the Armenian Church Trauma Centre in Mukundapur, off the EM Bypass.

 We have been working together with Riverbank Holdings on design inputs to try and achieve a better and more patient-friendly ambience in the health city. It will be a comprehensive healthcare campus addressing all the leading specialities and will also create teaching facilities for paramedical personnel, Raghuvanshi said.

 The cardiac hospital will be followed by renal, neurological and orthopaedic centres of excellence, to come up simultaneously. AHF, which has knowledge-sharing tie-ups with the University of Minnesota and the UAE University, will bring in both as partners in the Batanagar venture.

 This will be the best international-standard township around Calcutta and will change the entire ambience of the area. The presence of a golf course inside the development, along with golf villas, ample retail and entertainment options and a tightly controlled urban environment will make Batanagar an ideal location for medical tourism as well, Shetty observed.

 His thoughts were echoed by Dabriwal: In Batanagar, we are looking at making an urban statement, and not just doing business. So, we are building on roughly 40 per cent of what can potentially be built on the site.

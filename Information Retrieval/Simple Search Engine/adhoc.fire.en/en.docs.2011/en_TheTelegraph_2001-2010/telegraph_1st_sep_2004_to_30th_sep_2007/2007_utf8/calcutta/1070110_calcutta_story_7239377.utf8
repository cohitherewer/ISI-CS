The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Net prank data arrives 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is zeroing in on the people who created fake profiles of the chief minister on Orkut, a popular online social network.

 A part of the technical information required to track down the culprits has been mailed to the investigating agencys Bhabani Bhavan headquarters by the US-based owners of the website.

 Arresting the culprits is now a matter of time. The detectives are awaiting more information from the websites administrators, said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector general, operations, CID.

 The sleuths swung into action following a report in The Telegraph on the Orkut profiles bearing Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees name and photographs.

 The profiles were soon blocked by the website administrators, following a request by the CID top brass.

 Though we could not provide any evidence to prove that the profiles were fictitious, the website administrators listened to us, stated an officer of the CIDs cyber crime wing.

 Another officer added: We needed technical information from the Orkut authorities to arrest those who had created the profiles. Without the information, it was impossible to proceed with the investigation.

 We are confident that the culprits will eventually be rounded up. A person needs to provide certain details to become a member of the community. The culprits were invited to become a part of Orkut by existing members. We are trying to track them down, said the officer.

 The detectives refused to disclose any information about the culprits. All we can say is that the culprits are from the city or its adjoining areas. It appears that they are well-educated and from well-to-do families, stated the officer.

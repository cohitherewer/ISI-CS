 No one writes to the homebody

 The lady at the Old Court House Street corner. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta 

 She is on the wrong side of middle-age. She is short and stocky and sightless, so she cannot be compared to either the beggar girl with whom King Cophetua had fallen in love or anything remotely dramatic. 

 She is just an ordinary homebody. For years she has stood at one corner of Old Court House Street diagonally opposite Great Eastern Hotel, her back pressed against the rails of Raj Bhavan. She is always there, dressed neatly in a clean sari, her hair combed back severely. Rarely does she raise her voice above a murmur as she stretches out her palm.

 Who helps her take up position against the rails, when she arrives for work and how much she earns per day remain a mystery. She may not be able to see the grand edifices on this street but she is definitely surrounded by a rich patchwork of sound from the rumbling of trams and buses to the chatter of passersby. She is too young to have been there when the street used to attract fashionable shoppers, or during the violent demonstrations against the famous tram fare rise which the street had witnessed, but she sure feels the increasing volume of traffic. She takes the full blast of black exhaust fumes every day. She knows so much.

 Dean Mahomet: The first Indian writer in English 

 Long before kind Rushdie invented chutneyfication the confusion existed before the word the first Indian writer in English set up the first Indian takeaway restaurant in central London. 

 The year was 1810 and Sake Dean Mahomet (Sheikh Deen Mohammad), a Bengali in his early Fifties, offered the exotic hookah with real chilm tobacco and scrumptious dishes to British clients in the Hindoostane Coffee House in George Street. But in two years, the curry house fell flat of unknown reasons.

 How opalescent Dean got kissed, got wild and got a life, is a long string of adventures. 

 A Bengali by birth, he had immigrated to Ireland in 1786 after serving as a medical intern with the East India Company from the age of 10. 

 Scholars tell us that he plagiarised 18th Century travel narratives to publish his book in 1794 The Travels of Dean Mahomet, the first of the Indian writing in English. 

 Anyway, Englishmen were reading Edmund Burke then, and unlike his late 20th Century successors, our Indian writers specious travelogue failed to make an impression.

 But Mahomet was a trooheewalla (a trumpeter in John Company lingo) of his own exploits and a phoenix of initiative. Unperturbed by the fall of the Hindoostane, Mahomet overhauled his Indianness to suit tastes. He emerged as a pioneer, this time as the first shampooing masseur. And he set up the Indian Medicated Vapour and Sea Water Bath in a foggy London. 

 The business caught on like wild fire. Bored Londoners, in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars, suffering from rheumatism and gout, stiff joints and aches, and dreaming of the voluptuous indulgences of the East, rushed to Mahomets Bath to doze off and find fault with the east winds.

 Hospitals referred patients to him, and soon our writer was appointed, no wonder, First Shampooing Surgeon to His Majesties, King George IV and William IV. 

 What happened later? Mahomet went on to write another book in 1822. Shampooing, Or Benefits Resulting from the Use of the Indian Medicated Vapour Bath, went on to become a best-seller and saw three editions by 1838.

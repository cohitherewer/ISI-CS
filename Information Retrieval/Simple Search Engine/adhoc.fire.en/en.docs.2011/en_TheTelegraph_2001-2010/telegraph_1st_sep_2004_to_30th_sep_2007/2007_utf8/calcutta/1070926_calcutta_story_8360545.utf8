 Cop witness to cop threat in Todi case

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nazrul Islam

 A senior officer of the state police was aware of the threats issued by the anti-rowdy squad (ARS) of the city force to Sadique Hussain, a witness to the marriage of Priyanka Todi and Rizwanur Rahman.

 Nazrul Islam, the inspector-general of police (enforcement branch), is even ready to depose in court if the case comes up for trial.

 Sadique has complained that an ARS sub-inspector, Krishnendu Das, had threatened him over the phone and urged him to say that Rizwanur had married Priyanka against her wishes.

 One such threat call came while Sadique was sitting in Islams Bhabani Bhavan office on September 18. Rizwanurs body was found by the railway tracks near Bidhannagar on September 21.

 Sadique started crying on seeing the callers number on his cellphone and requested Islam to answer it.

 I took the call. It was Das on the other end, recalled Islam. He asked me to give the phone to Sadique. I told him I was Sadique, but he refused to believe me, saying he knew Sadiques voice. When I asked him why he was looking for Sadique, he ordered me to hand over the phone to him.

 It was then that Islam revealed his identity. Das told Islam he was merely carrying out the orders of his bosses.

 I asked Das to tell his bosses that whatever they were doing was illegal. Das must have called Sadique several times, because he knew his voice. Later, I asked Sadique to lodge a complaint with the state human rights commission, Islam said.

 Sadique has also accused another ARS officer, assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty, of threatening him. He said the two had threatened to frame him in a murder case if he did not give an undertaking that the marriage was solemnised against Priyankas wishes, Islam said.

 Priyankas father Ashok Todi had lodged a missing diary a day after meeting his daughter at Rizwanurs Tiljala Lane house. How can he do that after meeting his daughter? Section 182 of the IPC empowers the police to take action against Todi for misinforming them, Islam pointed out.

 He accused the police of violating a Supreme Court order by harassing the couple. The apex court has asked the police to protect adult couples if their families are against the marriage, he stressed.

 Those responsible for Rizwanurs death can be identified only if the probe is conducted impartially... Im ready to depose in court if need be, said Islam.

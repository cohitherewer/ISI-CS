The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A painter and a poet

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A work by Jogen Chowdhury on display at a city gallery now. The works are ornamental designs with some familiar images, similar to alpana of yore 

Nilanjan Bandyopadhyay is a zinger. He was educated at Santiniketan, he was a freelance journalist and is an artist as well. He has learnt Japanese and is currently working on a film. 

 He has youth on his side and Jogen Chowdhury too. Bandyopadhyay is also blessed by Calliope. He writes poetry.

 Chowdhury, who has known him from childhood, has collaborated on an exhibition now on at Mon Art Gallerie, where the senior artist has taken up his brush and painted spontaneously in response to the tiny poems expressive of a sliver or fragment of an idea or sentiment, some in jest, some in dead seriousness of Bandyopadhyay.

 Lines come naturally to Chowdhury. They flow from his brush with such facility that he is one of the most sought after artists in the country today. These works are mere strokes, dashes and waves and curves that turn into a flower, a womans face, a creeper or a labyrinth-like village pathway. The poems in Bengali as well in translation in English, some done quite amateurishly are placed next to the drawings.

 Chowdhury has dashed off some ornamental designs similar to alpana of yore. Many familiar images recur in his drawings. But he has some that look absolutely fresh and are quite funny too. The wall that divides, the ladder, the highrises with the sun burning above, the two-faced human being are all stand-alone images which have not turned into cliches. Chowdhurys strong design sense comes across in the image of a woman boxed inside straight and slanting lines. He has used a light wash behind many of the images.

 The poems and the drawings have already been brought out in the form of a book with facsimile prints, published by Shizen, which is collaborating with the art gallery. 

 The limited-edition book was launched at Taj Bengal on February 3 by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi. The first page of some of the books have been signed by Jogen Chowdhury. And signature is all that counts today.

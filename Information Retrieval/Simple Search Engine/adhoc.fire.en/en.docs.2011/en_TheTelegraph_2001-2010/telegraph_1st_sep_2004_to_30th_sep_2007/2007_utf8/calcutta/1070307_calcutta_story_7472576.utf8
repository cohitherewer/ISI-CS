 Clean and green: Unwind

 by the Lake with Tagore 

 Apropos the report Caring cop saves a life, January 18, it is encouraging to learn that Nirmal Kanti Saha, a sub-inspector of the special cell of the detective department, saved a man named Ashok Shaw after he was seriously injured in an accident at Dum Dum station. 

 The policeman showed great compassion by going beyond the call of duty to attend to Shaw at the station. Saha then took the injured man to NRS Hospital and ensured that he was properly treated. 

 What was disappointing was the inaction of the people who witnessed the accident. People gathered round the injured man but no one helped him. They were probably afraid of police harassment if they took Shaw to hospital. It is unfortunate that people are afraid of the administration to such an extent that they are even declining to come to the aid of a dying man. 

 The Government Railway Police officers, however, did not have such concerns. Yet, they declined to even arrange for an ambulance. Their behaviour is condemnable. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Rabindra Sarobars proposed upgrade based on three categories of Tagore songs is laudable (Prem, Prakriti and Puja at Lake, January 29). A handful of young men and women have put the few green patches in the city out of bounds. Afraid of catching lovers in action, families, especially if they consist of children and the elderly, fear to tread into parks. The Calcutta Improvement Trust should ensure that prem, the free-entry zone at Rabindra Sarobar, does not become a place for lovers to display to the world their affection for each other. 

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur. 

 It is good to know that the custodians of Rabindra

 Sarobar have taken an initiative to give the zone a makeover. The suggestion

 of experts of Jadavpur University in this regard are appropriate and timely.

 If the suggestions can be implemented, the Lakes will become at least twice

 as attractive. The entry fee could be used for maintaining Rabindra Sarobar

 and beautifying it in future. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake.

 Apropos the report Report card fears claim teenager, January 20, media reports have brought to life that more and more teenagers are ending their lives after failing to cope with the prospect of disappointing their parents. It is a shocking trend. And the coverage of such incidents in the media do not seem to help. The reports are seen by the youngsters who may be influenced to do something similar themselves. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake. 

 Life is more precious than any report card.

 Parents should learn from the death Dipika De, a Class XII student, and

 never overburden their wards with their unfulfilled dreams. Such incidents

 should not recur. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane. 

 The report Maidan saved, January 30, came as a relief for everyone who loves the environment and wants to lead a healthy life. The city is losing its greenery, endangering the lives of the residents. It is most unfortunate that the government tried to forcibly hold the Book Fair on the Maidan despite resistance from several quarters. 

 The states inability to provide an alternative fairground shows it in poor light. Due to the tug-of-war between Publishers and Booksellers Guild, aided by the government, and the green lobby, the labourers engaged to ready the grounds for the fair had to suffer. 

 R.N. De Bhowmik, 

 Dr PC Lahiri Sarani. 

 The Book Fair, if held on the Maidan, would

 have caused long-term damage to the greenery. After its role in the matter,

 the state government can no longer be trusted to protect the Maidan. 

 Inayat Husain, 

 Marquis Street. 

 The photograph of a solemn Soumitra Chatterjee in You share your birthday with..., January 19, brought back memories of the veteran thespians extraordinary performances in films like Abhijan and Saat Pake Bandha. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia.

 Apropos the report Comeback blacked out, January 22, millions of cricket-lovers could not watch the return of Sourav Ganguly to the Team India fold due to the telecast fiasco. Never before have the fans be so cruelly cut off from one of the most thrilling episodes in Indian cricket. How a channel like NEO Sports can bag the telecast rights of such an important series is beyond me. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 The report Medical body rapped for doctor clean chit, January 22, brings to light the underlying reasons for the abysmal status of healthcare in West Bengal. The state medical council gave a clean chit to wayward surgeons and now has been accused by the state health department for failure to provide justice to victims of medical negligence. 

 Kunal Saha,

 Ohio, US.

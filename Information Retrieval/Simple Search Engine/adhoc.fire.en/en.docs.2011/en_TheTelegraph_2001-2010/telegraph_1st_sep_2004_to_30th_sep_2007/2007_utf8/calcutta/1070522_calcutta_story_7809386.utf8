 Dowry death trial resumes

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Trial in the Tanuja Minni death case of July 1995 was restarted in Alipore court on Monday, five years after the main accused, Ajoy Minni, Tanujas husband, died.

 In July 1995, barely four months into her marriage, housewife Tanuja Minni died in a fall from the fifth floor of an apartment block in Woodburn Park.

 Tanujas mother, Jyotsna Kothari, lodged a complaint accusing Tanujas in-laws and her husband Ajoy of murdering her, as she had failed to meet their dowry demands.

 The incident hit the headlines and shocked the city. 

 Several seminars and public meetings were organised to protest the dowry system.

 The case took a serious turn when the post-mortem report confirmed that Tanuja had been beaten up before her death.

 Kothari, in her FIR, also held Tanujas father in-law Vinod Minni, mother in-law Sarla Minni and sister in-law Sandhya responsible for Tanujas death. 

 All four were arrested. But Sandhya was acquitted of the murder charges after she moved the high court. Ajoy, Vinod and Sarla were granted interim bail. 

 In 2002, while the trial was on, Ajoy died in an accident in Rajasthan. 

 On Monday, when the matter came up for hearing before the additional judge, Alipore, L.K. Verma, Kotharis counsel Amitava Ganguli submitted a notification claiming that his clients daughter had been killed by her in-laws.

 Sanatan Mukherjee, defence lawyer, has also started his argument.

 Public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh said: At present, Vinod and Sarla are facing trial. The chargesheets against the accused were filed in 2003, a year after Ajoys death in a mishap.

 The case will come up for hearing again on Wednesday.

 The second phase of work on the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector to EM Bypass has to be started by September 10, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya has ordered.

 Sources said disputes over land acquisition have held up work on the CMDA project.

 Of the six lanes of the connector, extending from Jadavpur police station to the Bypass, three lanes were laid in the first phase. The second phase involves laying of three more lanes from the Bypass to the Kalikapur overbridge, which lies almost halfway through the entire stretch.

 The Rs 15-crore project (second phase) is scheduled to be over by June 2008 but work has not yet started in full swing, prompting the minister to carry out an inspection of the site on Thursday morning. I want to see work progressing well when I will visit the site again on September 10, he said.

 According to sources, work on the second phase could not start as 22 families in Shahid Nagar are refusing to give up their land for the project, citing inadequate rehabilitation measures.

 Five families claimed they had not received any land-acquisition notice from the CMDA. Several of those who have given land alleged they were yet to receive compensation. 

 The minister ordered his officials to speed up the rehabilitation process. Four families have been relocated to Ambedkar Abasan, in Nonadanga. We will not acquire anyones land without arranging for proper rehabilitation, Bhattacharya said.

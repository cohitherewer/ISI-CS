 Terror cry over campus election

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The impasse over the students union election at Presidency College took a fresh turn on Thursday, with a member of the tribunal dealing with the allegation of irregularities in the polls claiming that an atmosphere of terror and violence was reigning on campus.

 The member said on condition of anonymity that the tribunal could not discharge its responsibility unless the situation improved.

 The college authorities, however, did not specify what steps would be taken to restore peace in the college. On Wednesday, Jorasanko police had to resort to a lathicharge to disperse clashing students.

 The tribunal has been set up to probe the allegation of false voting and to decide on repolls and the proposal to postpone the panel elections. The tribunal has dismissed the SFIs allegation that outsiders had voted in the poll.

 On the other issues, it said repolls should be held for the two tied seats in the first-year postgraduate constituency and that the panel elections be held at the earliest. 

 Principal Mamata Roy could not be contacted on Thursday. Her family sources said she was ill. 

 Former general secretary and Independent Consolidation (IC) leader Sayantan Saha Roy said: The panel elections should be conducted immediately. We have a clear majority, as the two tied seats will make no difference to the results. 

 He also demanded that the tribunal proceedings be made more transparent and journalists allowed free access onto the campus. 

 Pushan Das, president of the SFI unit, expressed the hope that the governing body would take our evidence into account.

 On Tuesday, the IC had claimed victory after securing 38 of the 73 seats of constituency representatives. The SFI had secured 33 seats. The results in two seats in the first-year postgraduate constituency were tied. 

 Student traced: Presidency College college student Pramodh Kumar Gupta, who was reported missing from Bauria, in Howrah, on Tuesday, was traced on Thursday. An RPF officer said Pramodh was arrested on a train in Tikiapara on charges of misbehaving with fellow passengers, including women. 

 He was released on Thursday. The college students denied the charge.

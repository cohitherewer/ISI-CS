 Young at art

 Galerie 88 celebrates the 88th birthday of Paritosh Sen by hosting an exhibition of 88 of his works. Stagnation is a word that cannot be associated with Sen, even at his ripe age. He has always been an integral part of the evolution of the Indian art scene over the decades, but his concerns have remained the same. As Sen says, art has always got to do with the reality around one. The present collection is the sum total of nearly seven decades of a continuous effort, on the part of the artist, to evolve. Sen claims that he has tried to convey all his convictions through these works and all that he knows of the language of painting. Fledgling Bird, one of his works from the ongoing exhibition, appears above.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Paritosh Sen When: September 27 - October 15 (except Sundays); 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

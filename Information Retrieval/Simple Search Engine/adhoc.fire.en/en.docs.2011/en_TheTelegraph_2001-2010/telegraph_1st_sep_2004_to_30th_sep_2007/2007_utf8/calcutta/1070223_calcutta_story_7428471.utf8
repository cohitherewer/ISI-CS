The detective department of the city police took charge of probing the death of film director Anjan Chowdhury on Thursday, following complaints of negligence against some doctors of BM Birla Heart Research Centre. 

 A three-member team of doctors, led by Dipankar Guha Roy, professor of forensic medicine, conducted the post-mortem at the Calcutta Police morgue in the presence of officers of the homicide wing of the detective department. 

 Chowdhurys son Sandip had lodged an FIR with Alipore police station against four doctors medical superintendent Anindya Chatterjee and cardiologists Ajay Kaul, Manmohan, and Subho Dutta and two others, accusing them of negligence leading to his fathers death. Police have started a case under Section 304A of Indian Penal Code (IPC). 

 We will examine the process by which the deceased was treated. And for this, we will seek experts help, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department). The deceaseds organs were sent for preservation for conducting a histo-pathological test and post-mortem report can be prepared only after the report reaches the doctors, he added. 

 Hospital authorities have, however, denied the charges. He (Chowdhury) had been a diabetic for over 12 years and was admitted with severe chest pain and poor heart function, said Anindya Chatterjee, medical superintendent of the hospital.

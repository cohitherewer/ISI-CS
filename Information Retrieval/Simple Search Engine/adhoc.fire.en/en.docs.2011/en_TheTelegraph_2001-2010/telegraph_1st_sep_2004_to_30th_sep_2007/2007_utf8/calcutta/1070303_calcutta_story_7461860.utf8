The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lost fragrance of festivity

 POULOMI BANERJEE

 Sitting behind rows of attar and perfume bottles in a crisp white kurta-pyjama, grey-haired Jamaluddin adds a bit of old-world charm to his Rabindra Sarani shop. The spring breeze against his face is a reminder that Holi is here. But the festivity is not what Jamaluddin remembers it to be. 

 In my youth, people would buy attar before Holi to mix with gulal. Now, few families can afford the luxury. There are a few aristocratic families in Lucknow that still ask for attar and we get it for them from Kannauj, explains Jamaluddin, whose family owns the Taj attar shop (picture by Bishwarup Dutta).

 Perfumed abir are available aplenty, but they dont have the fragrance of attar. Manufacturers buy synthetic perfume and mix it with abir. Its cheaper than using attar, says Neyazuddin Allah Bukhsh, owner of Haji Khuda Bukhsh Nabi Bukhsh (picture below by Bishwarup Dutta), also in Colootola. 

 From the beginning, attar has been used for perfuming gulal. The practice has come to a stop because of the price factor. About 5 g of attar is enough for 1 kg of gulal, but even that costs between Rs 75 and Rs 150, he explains.

 In comparison, a packet of scented abir costs just Rs 15. People would sometimes ask us to mix a bit of attar with abir, but that stopped two-three years ago. Now, customers prefer scented abir, says store-owner Swapan Saha.

 Neyazuddin says that there are still about eight to 10 families in the city that visit his shop before Holi for buying attar. Chandan, jasmine, beli, mogra and, of course, rose are popular picks for Holi. Bengalis prefer floral fragrances like rose and beli, while Marwari customers buy more of sandalwood.

 Neyazuddin asserts that attar is much better than perfumed abir. Harsh chemicals are used in gulals. Synthetic perfumes can only make them more harmful. Attar, on the other hand, is good for skin, he says.

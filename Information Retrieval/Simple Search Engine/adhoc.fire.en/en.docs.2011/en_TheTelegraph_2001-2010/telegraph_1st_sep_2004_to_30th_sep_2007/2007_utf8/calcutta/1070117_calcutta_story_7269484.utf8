 The merger of Bangur Institute of Neurology and 185-year-old Institute of Psychiatry to form Bangur Institute of Neuroscience and Psychiatry (BINP) was announced by the chief minister on Tuesday. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee also inaugurated an eight-bed intensive care unit and the second operating theatre of BINP on Tuesday.

 The health department had issued the merger notification on November 1, 2006. 

 BINP director Trishit Roy said the merger would help in the treatment of behavioural disorders. It has been proved that several behavioural disorders are caused by neurological problems, he explained. 

 Schizophrenia, Alzheimers and depression are some of the diseases with roots in the brain. At times, behavioural changes are caused by brain tumour, haemorrhage and even cerebral infection, elaborated the doctor. Access to advanced investigative procedures is needed to diagnose the diseases. The institute will offer such facilities.

 The hospital currently has 150 beds. Fifty more beds will be added soon. 

 The chief minister, while attending the golden jubilee celebrations of Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research, stated that the government was planning to increase budgetary allocation on health.

 More than 72 per cent of the patients in Bengal are treated in the state-run institutes, claimed Bhattacharjee. Centres of excellence are being planned in the districts. 

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said: The glory of the state-run institutes has faded over the years and we are responsible for that.

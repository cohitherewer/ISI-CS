 Civic takeover to save pond

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on Monday took over the management of a waterbody in south Calcutta to save it from landfill.

 Politicians from the ruling party as well as the Opposition had joined hands to save the half-a-century-old pond at 69 Prince Bakhtiar Shah Road, in ward 89, in Tollygunge.

 About two months back, we had received complaints from the local councillor, borough chairman and residents, stating that some unidentified people were trying to fill up the pond. After inquiries and the issue of a formal notice, we took over the management of the pond under Section 17A of the Inland Fisheries Act, said Sushil Sharma, the mayoral council member (environment) of the CMC. 

 The civic body has recently been given the power to implement the fisheries act in the area under its jurisdiction.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, legislator and borough X chairman Arup Biswas and local councillor Mamata Majumder were present during the takeover. 

 There have been attempts to fill up the pond, spread over approximately 26 cottahs, in the past year and a half. The effort to fill it up had intensified in the past few months, stated Biswas, a Trinamul Congress leader. 

 We have started to clean up the garbage that had been dumped in the pond. We plan to use the pond for pisciculture, once it is restored, said both Sharma and Biswas.

 According to civic officials, the environment wing of the CMC has taken on the responsibility of managing and, if required, restoring large ponds in Kashipur Lane and Daspara Road, in Behala, and Madaritala Jheel, in Jadavpur. 

 We have a budget of about Rs 2.5 crore for management and restoration of waterbodies, including large lakes, in the city, said Anindya Karfarma, a senior civic official.

 This is a welcome effort. I hope it will be a rule rather than an exception, stated environmentalist Mohit Roy of Basundhara.

 If a landfill can be attempted in Tollygunge, just imagine what has been happening in the fringe areas like Behala and Topsia. There are around 3,000 ponds in these areas.

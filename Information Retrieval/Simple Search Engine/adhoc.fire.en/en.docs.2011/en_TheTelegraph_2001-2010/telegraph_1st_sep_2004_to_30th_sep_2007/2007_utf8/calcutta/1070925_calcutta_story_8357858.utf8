 A different view

 N Y: Below the Belt, is Pradeep Dasguptas take on his experience of life in New York. Born to poor sculptor parents in early post-Independence India, Dasguptas inclination towards arts was always discouraged by his family. However, in a weak moment, his father gifted him a camera and since then Dasgupta was hooked to the lens. He worked as a copywriter in various advertising agencies before taking up advertising photography as a profession. This was almost 25 years ago, during which period he continued devoting time to personal projects the present exhibition is one such project. Dasgupta says he has tried to give free rein to his instincts rather than his head. The photographs, he claims, are all shot off the hip and are an escape from his usual style of manipulated images, slick lighting and crafty but still compositions.

 Event: An exhibition of photographs by Pradeep Dasgupta

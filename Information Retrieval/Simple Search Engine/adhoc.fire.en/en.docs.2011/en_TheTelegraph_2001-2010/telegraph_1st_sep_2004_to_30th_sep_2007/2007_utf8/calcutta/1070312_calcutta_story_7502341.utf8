 The South Calcutta Trekkers Association was formed in 1983, after a band of young men encountered a group on its way back from a trek to the Pindari glacier. It was the beginning of a journey that has taken the club to such peaks as Kedar Dome in 1996 and Shivling in 2003 (both in the Garhwal).

 On March 9, the organisation celebrated its silver jubilee at Ashutosh Centenary Hall of the Indian Museum. Mountaineer Santosh Yadav, the only woman in the world to scale Mount Everest in two consecutive years in 1992 and 1993, felicitated those who had contributed to the development of the club.

 Yadav, who was with Indo-Tibetan Border Police, said: Mountains teach you humility. They make you realise your strengths, since up in the heights there is no scope for mistake. Coming from a village in Haryana, I had never expected to come so far.

 She stressed the need to introduce mountaineering in the school and college curricula.

 The occasion also saw the winners of the SCTA Mountain Photography Salon being awarded mementos by the Yadav and former Union minister Satyabrata Mukherjee.

 Films on mountaineering, rock climbing and skiing were screened on March 10 and 11. Among the films screened were Everest (by David Breashears and Stephen Judson), depicting the 1996 expedition in which New Zealander Rob Hall lost his life, and Leo Dickinsons Eiger Solo, on the first solo ascent of Eiger, in the Swiss Alps, by Eric Jones in 1982.

 The club, with a member count of 100-plus, now wants to expand its activities. Secretary Santanu Saha said: We plan to increase the number of our annual trekking programmes from two to four. The club is also preparing for another expedition to Shivling this year.

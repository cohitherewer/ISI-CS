 Porch goes missing

 Old Court House Street was once synonymous with style. Some of the best tailors, jewellers, watchmakers, opticians and booksellers had their establishments here.

 Opposite what is Raj Bhavan today, was the famed Pelitis restaurant, where office-goers would drop by for lunch. That has turned into a newspaper office and save the marble plaque on the ground floor, there is nothing to indicate it was ever an eatery.

 All the posh shops are gone. Many years ago, herds of buffaloes used to plod across this street. It is not known if they left behind evidence of their presence for the roads were spotless. 

 Two of the best-known jewellery shops of those times were Cooke amp; Kelvey, now a white goods outlet opposite Great Eastern Hotel, and Hamilton amp; Co Ltd Jewellers Gold amp; Silver Smiths, By appointment to His Majesty the King with a porch.

 Robert Hamilton (1772-1848) arrived in India and started work in Calcutta in 1808. He opened his jewellery and silversmithing shop at 5 Tank Square in 1808, and in 1811 the establishment shifted to 7 Court House Street, where it remained until 1973 when it finally closed. 

 The clients were Brits, Europeans, zamindars and Indian royalty, and the craftsmen were mostly Bengalis, who could replicate designs in vogue in the West. 

 The jewellery shop had turned into a bank long ago. The porch survived till the other day.

 It disappeared last week. 

 Size matters

Those who paint on a larger scale have an expansive vision and it would be a disaster if somebody tried to shrink their works into a smaller frame. But if an artist represents his world in a grain of sand, would it hold life-size? Some Calcutta authorities seem oblivious to the question.

 Now, thanks to digital wizardry, images can be shrunk or blown up at ones sweet will, never mind the effect they make. Famous Renaissance and 19th Century paintings of the Passion of Christ and the Holy Family blown out of proportion have, for the past few months, been displayed all over the facade of the St Johns (Catholic church) at the Maniktala end of the Sealdah flyover. Out of context, they lose much of their richness and meaning although the images remain the same. 

 The tiny building is weighed down by the load of pictures, some of them looking skewed as a consequence of inexpert scanning. Size does matter. 

 Split personality

Theres no way to stop Chinese infiltration. Most Mughlai eateries in the city have developed a split personality and become part-Chinese. The latest to fall prey to the syndrome is the respected Mughlai food institution (New) Aliah on Bentinck Street.

 The place may serve one of the best biryanis in town (and some consider it to be vastly underrated), and is always crowded, and the waiters are some of the most pleasant men in town, but it has nevertheless bowed down to the pressures of the times.

 Adjacent to the original eatery, the owners have started another called Bayleaf, though its not clear what role this spice has to play in Chinese cuisine.

 The new restaurant serves Chinese and Tibetan food made with halal meat. Well, Mughal is Persian for Mongol and was used to refer to the central Asian nomads who claimed descent from the Mongol warriors of Genghis Khan. He invaded parts of China. The tables have turned.

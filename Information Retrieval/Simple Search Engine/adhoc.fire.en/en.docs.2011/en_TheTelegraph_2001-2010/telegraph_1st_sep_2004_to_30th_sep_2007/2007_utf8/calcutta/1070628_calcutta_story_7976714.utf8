 A prolonged spell of heavy rain may result in the collapse of Tallah pumping station, leaving taps dry in more than 2.5 lakh households. And if such a breakdown occurs, civic officials said, it would take at least two or three days to restore the supply.

 The fear of a collapse stems from the fact that the station gets flooded after a heavy shower and the water cannot be drained out because of a block in the storm water flow line. The conduit, which opens in the Cossipore canal, has not been functioning for the past seven years.

 The situation has turned so alarming that drainage pumps have to be installed to keep waterlogging in the station under check. But as the area outside the station, too, gets waterlogged, the water drained out soon finds its way in.

 The matter has been brought to my notice, civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Wednesday. We suspect there is a block in the underground storm water flow line of the Tallah pumping station. We need the help of the railways to clear the block, as the line passes under the Cossipore railway yard. I will take up the matter with the railway authorities.

 The railways had earlier ruled out the possibility of closing the yard for the duration of the repairs, which will take two to three days. Micro-tunnelling is the only option, but the technique is expensive and calls for special expertise, said chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) Tushar Ghosh.

 When British engineers started constructing the nine-million-gallon-capacity tank in 1909, they had taken into account the bowl shape of the land that causes waterlogging and designed the storm water flowline to prevent a collapse of the pumps after a prolonged downpour.

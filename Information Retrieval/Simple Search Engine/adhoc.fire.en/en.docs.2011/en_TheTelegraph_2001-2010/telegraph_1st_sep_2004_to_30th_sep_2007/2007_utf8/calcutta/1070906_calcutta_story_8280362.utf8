 Tease tag on teacher

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Teachers Day celebrations at Thanamakua Boys High School, in Howrah, were interrupted on Wednesday by cops on the lookout for an assistant teacher.

 Two brothers, one of them a student of the school, had lodged a complaint of sexual harassment against Santanu Mandal, who evaded the sub-inspector and the constable by fleeing through the back door of the Andul Road school.

 The brothers, both students of Class X, had been taking private tuition in mathematics from Mandal since May this year. They claimed they were harassed repeatedly during the lessons at Mandals Chunavhati home. 

 The police went there from the school but could not find the teacher. The school was hurriedly closed at 12.30pm and the students were asked to leave.

 District police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh said: We have received a specific complaint against the teacher. 

 The father of the siblings said: My sons have been complaining against the teacher to their mother for some time. We did not attach much importance to their complaints. Of late, they had started complaining to their aunt. She visited the teachers home on Sunday. This morning, we lodged the complaint.

 A team of teachers and managing committee members of the school visited the boys home on Wednesday. Nirmal Sen, the vice-president of the managing committee, said: We will punish the teacher if the allegation is found to be true.

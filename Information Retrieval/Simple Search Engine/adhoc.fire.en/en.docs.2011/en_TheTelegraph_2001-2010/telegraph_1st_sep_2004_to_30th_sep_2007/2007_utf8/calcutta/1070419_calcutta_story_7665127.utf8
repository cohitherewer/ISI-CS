 Shah Rukh Khan will be making his way to the Abhishek Bachchan-Aishwarya Rai wedding after all thanks to his fan club in Hedua.

 A special card bearing photographs and autographs of SRK will arrive at the AbAsh wedding venue on April 20 from the Shah Rukh Khan fan club in north Calcutta.

 Going by the Amitabh Bachchan vs Shah Rukh Khan rivalry buzz in Bollywood, that could well be the closest todays Don gets to the den of yesterdays Don. But Arnab Roy, secretary of the SRK fan club, is convinced their hero has been invited and will dance at the shaadi.

 Another special card, with photographs of Abhishek and Aishwarya, and a bunch of red roses will arrive at the Prateeksha gates in Juhu on Friday morning from the All Bengal Amitabh Bachchan Fans Association in Bondel Gate, south Calcutta.

 Coming from two opposite ends of town and of Bollywoods idol-worship spectrum the gifts from Calcutta would be bridging the great Bollywood divide of superstar egos, of Don vs Don, of KBC vs KBC.

 We had called up Amitjis residence after the Ash-Abhi engagement. He took the call and assured us that he would accept the gift. We have placed an order for a bouquet of red roses with a florist in Mumbai. One of our members, Abhijit Roy Chowdhury, will drop into Prateeksha to hand it over to Amitjis secretary on Friday morning, said Amitabh Fans Association secretary Sanjay Patodiya. Plus, the special card done up with posters of Guru.

 Also in the name of their hero, the fan club will host an Amitabh Utsav from July 30 with a photography and essay-writing contest. We met Amitji while he was shooting in the city for The Last Lear and he agreed to give out the prizes in Mumbai in December, claimed Sanjay.

 Back in the SRK universe, a happy hour beckons Arnab Roy and gang in the week of the Bachchan wedding, though tinged with sadness the last KBC episode this season, to be aired on Thursday evening, starring Salman, Katrina, Kareena, Priyanka and... Shah Rukh Khan.

 Within 24 hours of the dacoity in a flat off Garia Station Road, the southern fringes of the city got another scare with a flat in Kabi Sukanta Road, East Jadavpur, being looted on Sunday evening.

 Less than four km separate the two attack sites on two consecutive nights.

 Robbers entered the ground-floor flat of the Das family when no one was in and decamped with cash and jewellery adding up to over Rs 1 lakh.

 Policemen from East Jadavpur visited the house, followed by a Criminal Investigation Department (CID) team, but no breakthrough was achieved till late on Monday.

 Samir Das, a teacher in a school for the physically-challenged in Purulia, was in Midnapore on official work on Sunday, while wife Ranjana, who teaches in a school for the blind in Tollygunge, had gone out with their nine-year-old daughter.

 We were away from 1.30 pm to 9 pm on Sunday. On reaching home, I tried to open the door but it was locked from inside and all the lights were on. With the help of our neighbours, I entered the flat, only to find all the almirahs open and everything scattered on the floor, said Ranjana.

 Samir, who returned home on Monday, said the gang must have had inside information. They entered the house on Sunday evening and ransacked the place, he added.

 Residents of East Jadavpur said they were fed up of police inaction despite a spate of thefts and dacoities in what falls under chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Assembly constituency.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Elevated ring road for free car flow

 KINSUK BASU

 The proposed elevated corridor around the city with Strand Road serving as starting/ending point is finally set to take shape.

 The state government has given its in-principle go-ahead to the proposal, which was buried in files for the past few years. The 42-km ring road will provide a quicker route to motorists travelling from one fringe to another.

 Once the elevated corridor is laid, vehicles travelling from, say, Howrah to Ultadanga will not need to enter the city and push the heavy traffic in the central business district. The same can be said of vehicles moving from north to south. That will save a lot of time, explained a transport department official.

 Since this is a massive project the cost has been pegged at Rs 4,000 crore the plan is to go in for public-private partnership, the official added. A Malaysian company has expressed eagerness to take up the project and has been asked to make a presentation in a week and a half.

 The presentation, to be held at Writers Buildings, is likely to be attended by a host of ministers and senior officials, including the chief secretary and the finance secretary.

 According to the transport departments plan, the four-lane corridor, with a divider running all through, will start from Strand Road and run over Strand Bank Road, Shyambazar five-point crossing, VIP Road, EM Bypass, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Alipore Road and Diamond Harbour Road before touching down on Strand Road again.

 There will be arms in at-least 11 intersections including Ultadanga Road-EM Bypass, Shyambazar five-point, Strand Road-Rabindra Setu, St Georges Gate Road-Strand Road. Work is likely to proceed in phases, with engineers pointing at a few glitches that are yet to be ironed out.

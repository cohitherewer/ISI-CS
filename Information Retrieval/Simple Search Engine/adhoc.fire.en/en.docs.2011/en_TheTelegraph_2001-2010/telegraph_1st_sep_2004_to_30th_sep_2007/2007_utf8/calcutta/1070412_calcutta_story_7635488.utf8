 Summer time, sabbatical time

 - Three IT bosses take a revitalisation break, to teach and be taught

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Bikram Dasgupta and Roopen Roy:

 Harvard calling 

 This is sabbatical season in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees blue-eyed sector.

 Three big names in the information technology (IT) sector will be away this summer two studying at Harvard Business School and one teaching in a Kalimpong school.

 Leading the pack of summer absentees is Roopen Roy, managing director, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), who is already at Harvard for the Owner/President Management (OPM) programme. He is scheduled to get back by end-May and stay on in an advisory capacity at PwC.

 Joining him at Harvard is Bikram Dasgupta, CEO and chairman of Globsyn Technologies.

 I have always wanted to attend this OPM programme at Harvard but firstly it was too expensive and secondly I used to think that my company would not run without me! But now I can afford to take three weeks off for OPM, said Dasgupta.

 Its an academic pursuit with a difference for D.K. Chaudhuri, chief executive officer of Skytech Solutions Pvt Ltd, who is busy teaching at Dr Grahams Home in Kalimpong. I have always wanted to do this and this is the right time, he said before leaving his Sector V office for weeks.

 What drives top executives to take such a long break? They are looking more for emotional satisfaction than financial satisfaction, which they have already achieved. They are actually revitalising themselves by doing something novel to alter their life course, said psychologist Nilanjana Sanyal.

 Academics is a preferred option. I have met a lot of people from the IT sector taking a break and then joining academics for good to ease the pressure, observed Arup Bardhan, former Skytech vice-president.

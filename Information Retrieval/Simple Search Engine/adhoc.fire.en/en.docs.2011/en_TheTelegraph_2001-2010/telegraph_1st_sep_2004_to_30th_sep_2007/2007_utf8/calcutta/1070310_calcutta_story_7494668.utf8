The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Con man on the run held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After remaining elusive for more than eight months, Amal Pradhan, charged with defalcating about Rs 90 lakh, landed in the police net on Thursday. 

 Officers of the special cell of the detective department arrested the 37-year-old on AJC Bose Road. He has allegedly duped several people on the pretext of helping them sell their shares. 

 He was produced at Bankshal court on Friday and remanded in police custody till March 19.

 Posing as a broker, Amal first used to earn the confidence of his victims. He would then forge their signatures and handwriting to dupe them, an officer of the special cell told Metro on Friday.

 He added: By the time people realised Amals motive, they would be poorer by thousands. Amal carried this out for two years from 2004 to 2006.

 Officers of the special cell started looking for Amal following a complaint by Anima Chakraborty, an employee of Bank of Barodas Scottish Church College branch, in May 2006. Amal allegedly cheated her of Rs 4.75 lakh.

 A commerce graduate, Amal worked with share brokers for over a year. We are trying to find out how many people he had cheated and whether he was helped by others, stated the officer.

 The City Diary

 A gang broke into a cellphone shop on Ganesh Chandra Avenue, under Bowbazar police station, and fled with around Rs 4.5 lakh on Wednesday night. The lock on the door, however, was found intact. Police suspect the gang had hired children who entered the shop through the exhaust-fan hole. No one has been arrested. 

 Around 300 shanties were gutted in a fire near Bracebridge, in Taratola, early on Thursday. Six tenders fought for two hours to douse the blaze. Fire brigade officers said the fire might have started from an illegal godown. The cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained.

 A gang looted cash and jewellery worth Rs 1 lakh from two houses in Haridevpur, on the southern fringes of the city, on Thursday. Police said the houses belong to Sudhin Bose and Tanusree Das. No one has been arrested.

 Kamal Roy, a tailor, was arrested in Hridaypur, on the northern fringes of the city, on Thursday for kidnapping a bank agent, Arup Roy, and keeping him confined in his shop for the past five days. Kamal alleged that Arup had arranged a bank loan for him but paid Rs 60,000 less than what he had asked for. Hence his retaliation.

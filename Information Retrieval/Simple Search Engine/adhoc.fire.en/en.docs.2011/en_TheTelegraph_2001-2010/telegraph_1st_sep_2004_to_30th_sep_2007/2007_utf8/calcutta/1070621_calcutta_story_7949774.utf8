The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 To take a train, wade in sewage

 A 60-ft underpass under knee-deep sewage has stood between the Dum Dum station complex and passengers since the onset of the rains last week.

 A portion of Dum Dum Road, the only other passage to Dum Dum Junction and Metro Railway station from the Nagerbazar side, has been blocked by the public works department (PWD) for repairs. 

 As a result, passengers have had to wade through the dirty water or pay exorbitant fares to cycle rickshaw-pullers to reach the Metro and the railway station.

 On Wednesday, officials of South Dum Dum Municipality and the PWD inspected the underpass to work out a solution. 

 It is a hopeless situation. Neither the municipality nor the PWD is trying to solve the problem. Even after a brief shower in summer, the underpass gets waterlogged. And it remains submerged for months. No action is taken, said Kaberi Dutta, a resident of the area.

 The local residents further alleged that the PWD had not carried out repairs despite keeping the other passage blocked for the past two months. If it was open, the passengers could have entered the station complex from the BT Road side.

 If you do not want to wade through knee-deep water or pay Rs 10 to a cycle rickshaw-puller to cross a 60-ft stretch, you will have to come to Nagerbazar and then take the Metro from Belgachhia, which will take at least 40 minutes, said Amitava Saha, another resident of the area.

 According to him, rickshaw-pullers demand four times the usual fare to take passengers across the underpass once it gets waterlogged.

 One of the major problems of the area is the encroachment of two channels of the underpass by autorickshaws and cycle rickshaws. Thus, the buses and other vehicles can only ply through the road, which is in very bad condition.

 The condition of the road is so bad that buses often stop plying on the stretch, said another local resident.

 It seems that the officers of Dum Dum police station have leased out the underpass to rickshaw-pullers and vegetable vendors, he added. 

 Local MLA Rekha Goswami admitted that drainage was a problem in the underpass. 

 There are problems in the sewage line. We are trying to find a remedy, municipality chairman Srihir Bhattacharya said on Wednesday.

 Kanu Bose, secretary of Path Nirapotta Prochesta Committee, an NGO that deals with road safety, said local political leaders were allowing encroachers to settle in the underpass. 

 We are members of the ruling party but cannot take any action against the encroachment as it will lead to factional problems, said Bose. 

 The police refused to explain why the encroachers cannot be removed from the area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mystery of the missed viewer 

 The baffling business logic behind the cricket telecast imbroglio

 AdLib

 It indeed is intriguing. This city and presumably many others in the country were not able to watch the first few matches of the ongoing cricket series. The channel and their distributors had not been able to agree on the terms of trade. What is baffling is the business logic of this imbroglio.

 Neo Sports or Nimbus has bagged the rights by paying hundreds of crores. It therefore follows that they have to earn more crores to make a profit. Earnings for most media vehicles come from two sources. The first are the fees paid by the subscriber to consume the medium. The second are the fees paid by the advertisers. The latter depends on the number of eyeballs. Subscriber fees earn revenue, but have an inverse relationship with the number of subscribers. So the higher the subscriber fees (and therefore subscriber revenue), the lower is the ad revenue.

 A delicate balance is required so that the sum of the two gets maximised. It is in this context that the recent decisions of Neo Sports need to be seen. They were trying to negotiate subscriber revenue. In the process they had to sacrifice match days and presumably a significant amount of ad revenue.

 This is where the mystery deepens. One possibility is that their economics would demand a minimum contribution from subscriber fees and that minimum was not being met. But then the money already paid to BCCI is a sunk cost and the unrealised amount from the first few match days added to their woes.

 Equally enigmatic is the attitude of the channels of distribution. Take the DTH platforms Tata Sky and Dish TV. They are in the midst of a battle to convert a sizeable chunk of the cable homes into their platform. Moving to DTH is a significant change for the consumers both in terms of money as well as habit. This is not an easy marketing exercise. It would take months of tempting the consumer mind to conquer its resistance to change. But making them miss out on cricket is not a very good bait. Yet the first few matches of the series were not available on the DTH platform. They were busy negotiating.

 So on one hand we have Neo Sports who had paid huge fees for a highly perishable inventory. They had the economic courage to continue their negotiation when their inventory worth crores is perishing in front of their eyes. On the other hand, Doordarshan, MSOs and DTH operators had enough clout to black out the signals.

 That raises the million-dollar question do viewers figure at all in this confrontation? Do the two sides know the consumer side of the story? The consumer could well be saying you earn because I pay to watch. And then you earn more from others because I am watching. Yet you have the gall to deprive me of my viewing pleasure.

 It is likely that neither side in this battle expected the consumer to react strongly. They must have said where will the consumer go? He is so addicted that he cannot do without cricket. So let us finish our skirmishes, he will still be waiting. So he did at least this time. Yet there may well be a very serious underestimation of the consumer by the businesses.

 Wise men say revenge is a dish best served cold. Consumer revenge is often taken out of deep fridge. Telecasters beware new media is round the corner.

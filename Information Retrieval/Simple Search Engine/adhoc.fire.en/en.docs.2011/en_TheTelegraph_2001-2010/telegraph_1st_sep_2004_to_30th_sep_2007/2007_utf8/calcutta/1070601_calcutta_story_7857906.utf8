Her 70-year-old daughter died two days ago, but Manoda Roy, 90, a resident of Dharmatala Lane, Shibpur, still believes that she will get well soon, and go out begging as usual. 

 So, for the past two days, Manoda has not moved from the side of her dead daughter, Kanaklata Das.

 However, on Thursday morning, she realised that her daughter was too ill to get up and do the chores. She called an employee of the charitable dispensary, which has for 15 years been her home, to arrange for Kanaklatas treatment.

 Krishna Das, an employee of Shibpur Charitable Dispensary, said: There was an overpowering stench in the room. To my horror, I found that the decomposed body of Kanaklata was on the floor, and Manoda was sitting beside her, stroking her daughters forehead. 

 The neighbours called police, who sent Kanaklatas decomposed body for post-mortem. Manoda has been given shelter in the drug detection centre of Shibpur police station. 

 Neighbours said Manoda and Kanaklata went without food most days. Manoda begged at Shibpur bazaar and on the days slim pickings, both somehow managed to survive.

 Though her only son, Biren Roy, lives on nearby Shibpur Road, he never cared for either his mother or elder sister Kanaklata. The old woman had left her home unable to bear the torture, allegedly at the hands of her daughter-in-law, Arati Roy. 

 My daughter-in-law used to torture me and my son kept mum. So I left, said Manoda, sitting among drug addicts at the drug detection centre of Shibpur police station. 

 Samarendranath Das, inspector-in-charge, Shibpur police station, said: We have decided to keep her at our drug detection centre to ensure she has a roof above her head. At least she can get two square meals a day. 

 The room at Shibpur Charitable Dispensary, which the two women shared, was earlier used by the compounder of the dispensary. He died about 15 years ago. Manoda started staying there. Later, Kanaklata joined her after her husband died and she was driven out by her in-laws. Biren Roy agreed to perform the last rites of his sister.

 Rubaina Siddique is set to be the second doctor in her family. The daughter of a businessman dealing in electronic goods grew up emulating her doctor cousin Anjum Amin. 

 On Monday afternoon, her dream came true as she found her name on the list of successful candidates put up by the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examinations Board. 

 I am so excited. This is a big surprise. I expected a rank between 200 and 300, but I never thought that I would be among the top 10, said Rubaina, planning a family get-together on Tuesday at her Temple Street residence, in central Calcutta. 

 The Saifee Hall English Public School student has ranked seventh among the 1,700 successful candidates, shortlisted to pursue education in nine medical colleges across the state. This was my third attempt at JEE. I am so happy and everyone in the family is elated, said the 19-year-old, who wants to be become a cardiac surgeon. 

 It was the first shot at JEE for Uddipta Maity. The Ariadaha Kalachand High School student made it to the top five on a list bearing 45,000 names. 

 There are around 17,000 seats in 54 engineering colleges in the state, but the board has announced 45,000 names. Everyone started congratulating me after the results were out. Everyone is offering me sweets, said Uddipta. 

 Other successful candidates, like Atri Pal and Tamaghna Biswas, were also flooded with congratulatory calls as they were preparing to celebrate. 

 Maintaining the trend, the city schools have fared well in the JEE. According to data collated by the board, schools like St Lawrence, Nava Nalanda, South Point, Patha Bhavan and Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission have churned out the maximum number of successful candidates in the engineering and medical streams. 

 City schools do better than the ones in the districts in competitive examinations like JEE because of the quality of training, said Krishna Damani of South Point. 

 Atri Pal, fifth on the medical list, echoed Damani. The ex-student of St Xaviers School had made it to the merit list last year. But my rank was low, so I did not even go for the counselling. This year, I put in extra effort and also attended tuitions, said Atri, whose is a family of doctors. 

 Tamaghna, a student of Nava Nalanda, always wanted to follow his doctor father. It was one of the reasons he slogged hard for a berth in medical college.

 Understanding relationships

 An ode to William Makepeace Thackerays celebrated novel by the same name, Vanity Fair, the ongoing group exhibition of paintings, explores the complexities of human relationships. Though not directly representative of the theme of the novel, the works on show aim to convey the tribulations of the human psyche, as well as the prejudices and vanities afflicting all inter-personal relationships. The paintings of G.R. Iranna dwell on the human form. T.M. Azis depicts people interacting with other elements. His paintings record everyday, commonplace occurences, as perceived by the artistic imagination. Other participants: Bhamri Vijayata, Chintala Jagdish, Farhad Husain, Gayatri Gamuz, Jignasha Ojha, Joydip Sengupta, Manil Gupta, Manjunath Kamath, M. Pravat, Saumya Krishnan, Sougata Guha, Sharmi Chowdhury, Simrin Mehra Agarwal, Surekha, Viraj Naik and Vibha Galhotra. Curated by Bhavna Kakar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Runway lights trip

 - Flights disrupted at airport

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Category II Instrumental Landing System

 The Calcutta-Dibrugarh flight of Indian airline rolled out of the parking bay for take-off at 9.45am on Thursday but stopped midway as the approach lights, part of the newly-installed Category II Instrumental Landing System (ILS) on Calcutta airports primary runway, went out. The flight was carrying 112 passengers.

 Consequently, flights were disrupted for nearly half an hour, thereby delaying the take-off of five flights, airport sources said. 

 Officials said one of the approach lights went off around 10am after a short circuit. This, a day after part of the surface of the runway peeled off, endangered the lives of the passengers.

 On sighting smoke, the alarmed authorities switched off all the lights. The short circuit was probably due to the rain, an official said. Repair work was taken up immediately and the lights were restored soon, he said.

 This resulted in the delay of flights. Airport sources said for nearly 30 minutes, from around 10am to 10.40am, no flights could operate from the airport. Indians Dibrugarh flight, which was scheduled to take off at 9.45am, could finally be airborne at 10.45am.

 The airlines Guwahati flight, which had to wait on the taxi bay, took off at 11.05am instead of 10.15am, and the Imphal flight was airborne at 11.58am, almost an hour behind schedule.

 Two flights of Jet Airways, both bound for Guwahati, too, got delayed by around 45 minutes, the airline officials said. 

 According to airport sources, Kingfisher Airlines Hyderabad-Calcutta flight, scheduled to land at 10.05am, had to be kept on hold for some time mid-air as the lights were being repaired.

 The secondary runway is used for flight operations when the main runway remains closed. On Thursday morning, the visibility was inadequate for flights to land on the secondary runway, which does not have the ILS facility.

 For landing on or take-off from the secondary runway, the minimum visibility should be 3,600 metres.

 However, on Thursday morning, the minimum visibility varied from 1,500 metres to 2,000 metres, the airports Met department said.

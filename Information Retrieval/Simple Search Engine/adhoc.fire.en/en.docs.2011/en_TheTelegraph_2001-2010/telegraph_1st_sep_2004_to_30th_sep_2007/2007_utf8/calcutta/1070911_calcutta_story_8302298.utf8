The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Management in times of change

 B. Muthuraman

 On the sidelines of the National Management Convention in the city last week, Metro spoke to B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel and co-chairman of the convention, Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman RPG Enterprises and chairman of the convention, and Subir Raha, executive vice-chairman of the Hinduja Group and president of AIMA, about the challenges of managing new India. Excerpts from the interviews: 

 B-schools are putting a lot of stress on business ethics. What is the importance of ethics in management?

 BM: Tata Steel has a set of core values since its inception. These core values integrity, understanding, excellence, unity and responsibility drive all business decisions even today. Ethics is of utmost importance in management and the smooth functioning of a company. 

 Tata Steel has a Code of Conduct in place to monitor employees across all levels and all centres. One of our new concepts is the whistleblower policy, in which every employee has the right to object to unethical practices in the company. Tata Steel also celebrates June as the ethics month.

 In the past two years, Tata Steel has become the second most geographically diverse steel company in the world. How have you been coping with sudden and big changes in the organisation?

 BM: It is not the size that is important to us right now. Our vision is to become a world-class steel company in every sense and simultaneously continue to be a good corporate citizen. 

 NatSteel, Millennium Steel and most recently Corus all share very similar work ethics and operating culture. With these companies now a part of Tata Steel, one of the greatest challenges is to work together with similar ideologies and philosophy to achieve higher levels of corporate governance and customer delight. 

 We have seen induction of Corus executives on the Tata Steel board and vice-versa. Do we see such free flow of workers among all companies down below in the organisation? 

 BM: Integration of different cultural entities is not about transfer of employees. What is essential is integration of culture and best practices. 

 So far Tata Steel has participated in steel industry consolidation by acquiring other companies. Do you think that there is a possibility that some day others might want to acquire Tata Steel? 

 BM: Efforts to become the very best steel company in the world will take us to a significant size, well beyond what we are today.

 What is the importance of ethics in management? 

 Sanjiv Goenka 

SG: Both B-schools and the Indian corporate sector are attaching a lot of importance to business ethics. There is a growing realisation that ethical businesses will find it far easier to serve and survive in the new environment.

 What will be the USP of the the B-school you are setting up in Calcutta? How different will it from other management institutes? 

 SG: The Calcutta B-school will be state-of-the-art and will fill a big gap. We already have a management institute in Delhi, which enjoys an excellent reputation. 

 The retail sector has been facing a shortage of skilled human resource. How far are the management institutes geared up to meet the boom in the retail and real-estate sectors?

 SG:The retail sector is at the moment one of Indias fastest growing businesses. There is a sharp rise in the demand for experienced people in the sector. At Spencers, training of the people who will run the outlets is highly important. Our training facilities are being expanded fast. The role of management institutions can also be significant. The scope for training on the job is immense.

 RPG Enterprises is in expansion mode. The flagship company of the group, CESC, has gone from power into retail and real estate. What is the secret of managing a conglomerate that CESC promises to be? 

 SG: RPG during the past two-three years has done very well, with the turnover rising 20 per cent in the last financial. All the six business sectors (power, transmission, tyres, technology, retail and entertainment) have done well.

 The contribution of the power sector is around 23 per cent. CESC has effected a remarkable turnaround. 

 There has been an unprecedented operational improvement across parameters. Budge Budge generating station recently received an award from the Prime Ministers Office. The next phase of growth will be in generation. A third unit is coming up at Budge Budge.

 Subir Raha

 What are the challenges facing a professional manager like you today?

 SR: Indian economy is expanding fast and so are Indian companies. Everyone is trying to expand into new geographies and new sectors. The managers have to work hard and fast. Speed of thought and action is very important you have to beat others to snatch a deal or be in the market with products.

 I can see that the appetite for risk has gone up manifold. So the challenge is to manage the risk. Since you are going to different countries, you have to be aware of different working cultures. The approach to a Japanese would have to be completely different from that to an American. 

 I think managing physical stress is a big issue, too. We are all working in different time zones. When Indians are going to sleep, their colleagues are entering the boardroom and vice versa. Someone has to sacrifice sleep and work but again have to be present in the office in the morning. Even if you are working within India, the days of complacency are gone. Post-1991, government policies are changing fast. You must be aware of what is to come and adapt faster than others.

 You have worked in Indias most profit-making PSU. Now you are heading a conglomerate in the private sector. What is your take on the different styles of management in the public sector and the private sector? What are the positives and negatives of each approach? 

 SR: Whether you work in the public or private sector, the basic principles remain the same for professional managers. They have to be responsible. The owner may be well-defined, as in the case of Reliance Industries where promoters own the share, or it may be public sector units where the owner is someone who does not hold a single share. Let me not go into further details but it is sufficient to say that managers should work with the board and for all the shareholders.

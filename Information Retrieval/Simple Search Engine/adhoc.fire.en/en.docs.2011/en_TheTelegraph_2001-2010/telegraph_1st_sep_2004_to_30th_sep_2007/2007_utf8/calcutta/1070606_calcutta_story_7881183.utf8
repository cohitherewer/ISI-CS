The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Baby bruise not from mothers fall 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The building from where Manisha fell

 A day after Manisha Bajoria was found dead on the pavement of Chittaranjan Avenue, police rubbished the familys claim that her 21-month-old daughter was in her arms when she fell from the balcony of their second-floor flat.

 Investigations have revealed that the daughter was not on her lap when pedestrians found her lying on the pavement. We have not found any witness so far, Nurul Anwar, officer-in-charge, Jorasanko police station, told Metro on Tuesday.

 Manishas in-laws had claimed that little Poonam was in her mothers arms when the 24-year-old homemaker jumped from the second floor. Poonam had bruises on her legs but a medical examination confirmed on Tuesday that the injury was not caused by the fall.

 The report from Medical College and Hospital clearly mentions that the minor injury could not have been caused by a fall from the second floor, asserted Anwar.

 It is not possible that a 21-month-old child will not suffer any serious injury while her mother suffers multiple fractures and dies on the spot. We have interrogated Manishas in-laws, added the officer.

 With mystery shrouding Manishas death, her father Pawan Kumar Agarwal was called to the Jorasanko police station on Tuesday.

 The investigating officers asked him whether he suspected any foul play in his daughters death. He did not name anyone, confirmed an officer.

 Manisha got married to Gopal Bajoria in February 2004. Police interrogated Gopal and his parents throughout Tuesday to try and ascertain whether Manisha had jumped from the flat.

 A team of officers visited the building and spoke to the neighbours of the Bajorias. The police officers learnt that the building at 180A Chittaranjan Avenue had witnessed the suicide of two women in the past three years all of whom had jumped from their balconies.

 P.K. Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) said: As of now, it seems to be a case of suicide because nobody has lodged any complaint. We have started investigation and are awaiting the post-mortem report to ascertain the nature of Manishas injuries.

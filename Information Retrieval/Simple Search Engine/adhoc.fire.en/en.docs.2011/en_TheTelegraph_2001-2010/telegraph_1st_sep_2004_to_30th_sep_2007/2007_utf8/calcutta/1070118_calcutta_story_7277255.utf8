 Licence to keep tab on pet vaccination

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic health department has decided to reintroduce licences for pet dogs, to ensure proper vaccination.

 The step has been initiated to monitor the success of the anti-rabies vaccination programme to be rolled out by the state government by March-end, said mayoral council member (health) Subodh De.

 From now, a dog-owner will have to produce a vaccination certificate to apply for a licence.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and a few NGOs will play a big role in making the anti-rabies mission successful in every ward. We are initiating the programme shortly, said animal resources development minister Anisur Rahman at a meeting to mark Animal Welfare Fortnight on Sunday.

 In addition to pets, the civic body will form units in every ward to sterilise and vaccinate the stray dogs. 

 The first unit was inaugurated at Telengabagan on Sunday. Love-N-Care for Animals, an NGO, vaccinated 60 strays in the Telengabagan, Murari Pukur Lane, Muchibazar and Jawaharlal Dutta Lane areas.

 Earlier, the dog licence was issued by the licence department. But after its reintroduction, the civic health department will issue them, mayoral council member De added.

 Since the pre-Independence era till 2006, only 0.2 dog-owners got their pets recorded in the civic register. Owing to such a poor response, the licence department was forced to discontinue the practice.

 In a meeting with the CMC and the NGOs, the state animal resources development department called for the reintroduction of licences to keep a tab on the vaccination, explained chief municipal health officer Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay.

 The state vaccination drive will start by March-end in all the CMC wards. At present, operation theatres and post-operative kennels are being constructed in some wards.

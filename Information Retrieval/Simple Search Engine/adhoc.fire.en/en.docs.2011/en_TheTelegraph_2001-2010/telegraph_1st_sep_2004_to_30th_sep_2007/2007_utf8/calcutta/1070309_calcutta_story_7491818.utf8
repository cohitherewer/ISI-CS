The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fast track to fatal fork

 - 11 deaths in four months; cops too few to act

 KINSUK BASU 

 Four fast roads meeting at one vital crossroad. A steady stream of pedestrians waiting to cross. One traffic outpost with two constables struggling to maintain order.

 The road to the fast-track sector of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal is paved with peril. Ask the grieving family members of 30-year-old Debasish Sau, run over by a speeding car at the killer crossroad on Thursday morning.

 It is risky business, walking or driving here. Even we feel uneasy, just watching the traffic flow, admitted S.P. Bhattacharya, a constable from the Sixth Battalion of the State Armed Police.

 Bhattacharya was witness to Thursday mornings fatal accident that claimed the young software professional.

 A few days ago, my colleague Indrajit Hazra had a close shave when a speeding car lost control and almost smashed into the traffic outpost, he added.

 On Holi, two youths, close to Thursdays accident site, were not that lucky. A speeding Tata Sumo knocked them down. They died on the spot.

 A fortnight ago, a cyclist was killed in the heart of Sector V near College More when a reckless private bus rammed into him.

 At least 11 people have died in this high-profile zone in the past four months, said police, quoting from the fatal accident files.

 The reasons are not hard to find or rectify.

 There are neither reflectors nor the mandatory white line for vehicles to pause.

 Next, there is no dedicated force to maintain traffic flow here. The two local police stations Bidhannagar (East) and Bidhannagar (South) are so short-staffed that they cannot deploy anyone to man traffic. So, even traffic posts go empty.

 It is surely a cause for concern for everyone and we have chalked out a plan to address the mess. Certain steps need to be taken on a war footing to manage traffic in Sector V. We have called a meeting on March 13 to discuss this issue, said S.A. Ahmed, chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, the apex body looking after Sector Vs infrastructure.

 Cops say things wont change unless there is a sense of discipline among drivers and pedestrians.

 There was a traffic signal at the spot but even then the accident took place. We have decided on a few things but we need to implement them as soon as possible, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 The Sector V crowd blames it on speeding vehicles and police inaction. 

 The pool cars in Sector V are only bothered about their drop deadlines. The bus drivers, too, shift into top gear as soon as they hit this stretch. When will the police finally act? they asked.

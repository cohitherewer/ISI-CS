 A summer bonanza

 The on-going Summer Show at CIMA Gallery, Calcutta features about 50 artworks by artists from all over India. Arpita Singh creates a rich haze of soothing colours such as aquamarine, brick red and green in her watercolour. It is a comforting painting that holds the promise of shelter and care. Yogesh Rawal shows much restraint in the use of colour and lines. Jaya Ganguly creates a chimera who is a veiled woman. There are works by Manu Parekh, Ganesh Pyne, Jatin Das and Jogen Chowdhury, but what strikes the viewer is a large canvas by Kingshuk Sarkar. Sumitro Basaks body stretching across the length of the canvas, like that of a yoga practitioner, is quite striking. Shakilas collage is wonderfully detailed. Pampa Panwar remembers the mango trees in Santiniketan, where she lives. Sreyashi Chatterjee uses the feminine crafts of stitching and embroidery to produce her takes on domesticity and workaday reality. Earlier, her works used to be small. Now they have spread out and have broken out of the confines of home. She presents two works here, one of which evokes her secret garden with its perfect square patch of green in the middle, surrounded by flower beds, along with suggestions of honeycombs.

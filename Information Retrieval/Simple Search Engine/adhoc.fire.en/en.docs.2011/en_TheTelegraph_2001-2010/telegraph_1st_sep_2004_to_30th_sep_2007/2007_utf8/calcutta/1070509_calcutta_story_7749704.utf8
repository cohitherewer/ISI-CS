 Residents of Golf Gardens, in south Calcutta, have set up an energy park. It is being built around a five-bigha waterbody, known as Chittar Jheel. 

 The park, christened Golf Gardens Park, will be inaugurated on June 5, observed as World Environment Day. The West Bengal Renewal Energy Development Agency (WBREDA) is collaborating with the Golf Gardens Residents Welfare Association on the project.

 The area around the jheel was in a sorry state for a long time. The residents cleared the zone, utilising funds provided by leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee, who used to be the legislator of the area. 

 We wanted to illuminate the banks of the jheel in an eco-friendly manner and approached S.P. Gan Chowdhury, director of the WBREDA, for information on solar lamps. He gave us Surjyabandhan, a type of solar lamp, for a trial run, said secretary of the residents association A.K. Sinha. 

 The residents were happy with the lamp after the trial run and wanted to use it to light up the entire park. About 10 lamps were needed, but the price around Rs 38,000 each proved an impediment. 

 We approached power minister Mrinal Banerjee for help. He liked our plan and helped us get the lamps at a subsidised rate. The convener of the associations environment committee, Gopal Mukherjee, provided a major portion of the funds, said Sinha. 

 Gan Chowdhury said it was the first such private initiative. We support such projects because they help us preserve nature and save fuel, he said. 

 Sinha said the association plans to start pisciculture in the jheel. The income from selling fish will be used to maintain the park.

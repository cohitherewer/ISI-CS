 Youth held for break-in

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Salt Lake police on Tuesday arrested a 22-year-old youth over the robbery attempt at Ram Babu Agarwals house in AB block early on Saturday. Shubankar Biswas, alias Botol, has told the police how the plan was hatched and who his accomplices were.

 Shubankar, from Basanti Colony in Ultadanga, had organised the robbery after receiving specific information about the Agarwals. Perhaps, the gang members got to know that Ram Babu had recently withdrawn a hefty sum and had kept it at home, said Prasun Bannerjee, the sub-divisional police officer of Salt Lake. 

 The police had picked up a torn shirt left behind by a gang member. The shirt possibly had come off when Siddhartha Srestha had given chase and caught hold of a gang member before being shot in the stomach.

 The shirt had the tailors tag with his address and in the pocket was a scrap of paper with a mobile number. We traced the number to a former goon. He gave us some vital leads, said a senior officer of the Bidhannagar (North) police station.

 Doctors at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital claimed that the condition of braveheart teenager, who had undergone a surgery to remove the bullet, was now stable.

 He is in the surgical ward of the hospital and the authorities are bearing the cost of his treatment.

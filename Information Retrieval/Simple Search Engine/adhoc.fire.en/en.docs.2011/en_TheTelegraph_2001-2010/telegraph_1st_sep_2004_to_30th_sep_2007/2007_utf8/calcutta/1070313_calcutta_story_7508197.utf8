 Cops, signals and parks for tech hub

 SUCHETA CHAKRABORTY

 After four deaths and seven injuries on Sector V streets over the past two weeks, the West Bengal Police has chalked out a plan of action to ensure safe roads in the showcase tech hub.

 A presentation was made in this regard by Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (SP), North 24-Parganas, at a meeting held at Nicco Park on Monday.

 Chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority S.A. Ahmed and representatives of the IT firms attended the meeting.

 Twelve policemen have been added to the existing force of eight to beef up security in the area from Tuesday.

 We have picked nine major points where there is a need for immediate installation of traffic signals, said superintendent Kumar. The nine points are Bowlers Den, Nicco Park main gate, the divider cut-out in front of Nalban, Benfish crossing, SDF Building, Webel Bhavan stop, College More crossing, BSF More and Box Bridge, a gateway to New Town. 

 An overhead footbridge is also needed to cross the busy main road and reach Sukantanagar from the Eastern Drainage Canal bank, near the KB-KC iron bridge, Kumar added. The bridge connecting Sector V and Karunamoyee will be widened. Another overhead flyover will be constructed to take traffic on the bridge to Rajarhat.

 Two traffic signals, one at College More and the other one near Bowlers Den, will be installed immediately, said Kumar. 

 Enkon, one of the two private agencies given the responsibility of beautifying and developing the infrastructure of the 360 prime acres, gave another presentation for the Rs 25-crore project.

 The four-km stretch adjacent to Eastern Drainage Canal, said Enkon director Aninda Banerjee, will be beautified with gardens. Hedges will be planted on the dividers so that pedestrians cannot pass through. Two gates will be erected at the two entry points of Sector V. There would be one at the Bypass-Chingrihata crossing and the other on the Rajarhat side, said Banerjee.

 All those selling food on the Sector V streets will be accommodated in a food court so that they do not litter the place, said Banerjee. 

 Six venues have been earmarked for parking lots. 

 Work has just started and I hope it will progress to the satisfaction of the administration and the IT industries, said Ahmed. He proposed to organise a traffic safety week to spread awareness about rules.

 These are definitely positive steps towards improving the IT sector. We are thankful to police for thinking about our safety and security, said Piyush Goenka, manager of Infinity Infotech Parks, which is housed in the IT hub.

 Installation of six closed-circuit television sets is in progress, for which some IT firms have come forward with sponsorships.

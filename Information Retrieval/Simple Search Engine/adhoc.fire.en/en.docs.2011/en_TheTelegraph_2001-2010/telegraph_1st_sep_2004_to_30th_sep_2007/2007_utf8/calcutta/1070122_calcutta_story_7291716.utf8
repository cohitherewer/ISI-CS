 Sunday morning, Nagpur. Sourav Ganguly steps out to Daren Powell, lifts him effortlessly over long-off for six to reach his 50 off 54 balls and punches the air. Dada is back, roars the country.

 Sunday morning, Calcutta. Sourav Ganguly fans are reeling under the punch of no Neo Sports, no Nagpur match. Dada is back, but we could not see the one match we were all waiting for, cries Calcutta.

 Admiration for their hero merged with anger on the cablewallah as hardly 15 per cent of the citys TV homes could catch Sourav in live action.

 The channel is available only in CAS areas and we cant do anything, was the curt reply of most cablemen to frantic calls from cricket-lovers denied.

 So, only subscribers in the CAS Phase I zone, who had paid to view the new sports channel through a set-top box, could watch all the 109 balls that Sourav faced. 

 Neither of the DTH service providers (Tata Sky and Dish TV) had Neo Sports.

 For the rest of the city, it was either a tale of missing the whole match or briefly catching pirated feed to cool frayed tempers before a message on the screen Neo Sports is a pay channel and the rate is too high... So, non-CAS zones are not able to telecast the channel... Please bear with us blanked out cricket action. The city was then forced to surf news channels for ticker updates and recorded glimpses of Souravs strokes.

 Yet again, the failure to agree on a fee for a pay channel (Neo Sports, in this case) by MSOs and the distributor (STAR, in this case) cost the viewer dear.

 From January 1, 2007, the Nimbus-owned sports channel became a pay channel. The rate they offered (effectively Rs 11.25 per subscriber per month) was not accepted by MSOs and negotiations were on. Some MSOs started airing pirated signals of the match under pressure from subscribers this morning. But the distributor then took its signals off the air and the screens went blank, said a cable industry insider.

 Though missing Souravs comeback will continue to hurt Calcuttans, there is hope in the air for the Cuttack ODI on Wednesday. Things are grim, but we expect to arrive at an agreement before the second match, said a senior official of STAR.

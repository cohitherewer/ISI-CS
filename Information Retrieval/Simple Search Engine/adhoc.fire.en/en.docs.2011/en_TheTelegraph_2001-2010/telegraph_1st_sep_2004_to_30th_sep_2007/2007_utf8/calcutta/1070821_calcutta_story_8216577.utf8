 Twin suicides: 2 held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The wife and brother-in-law of Anup Saha, who committed suicide with his elder sister on Sunday morning, have been arrested.

 We have arrested Chaitali, Anups wife, and her brother Falguni Saha at their fathers home in Behala Chowrasta, said an officer of Belghoria police station. They have been accused of abetting the suicide of the brother-sister duo.

 Anup, 40, an employee of Calcutta Tramways Company, was found hanging in the bedroom of his Lakshminarayan Park flat. The body of his 52-year-old sister, Bulu, was found in the dining room.

 The arrests followed a complaint by Anups elder brother Swapan, who alleged that Chaitali used to pressure her husband to throw Bulu out of the apartment. 

 She used to torture Anup mentally as he turned down her demand, said Swapan.

 Chaitali admitted before the police that she told her husband to ask Bulu to leave their flat. Falguni has been arrested as neighbours alleged that the brother-sister duo had threatened Anup with dire consequences on Wednesday if he did not throw out Bulu.

 We have come to know that Chaitali had even threatened to lodge a complaint under Section 498 of the IPC against Anup if he failed to carry out her order, said an investigating officer.

 The neighbours said Anup was brought up by his sister and he treated her like his mother.

 Chaitali and Falguni have been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

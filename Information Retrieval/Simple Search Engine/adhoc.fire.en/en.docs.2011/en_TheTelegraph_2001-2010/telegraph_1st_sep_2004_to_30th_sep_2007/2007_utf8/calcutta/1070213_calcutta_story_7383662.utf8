The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High-end and star-struck 

 - Happy hotels pat resurgent Bengal for soaring room rates

 A STAFF REPORTER

 When a regular business visitor to Calcutta wanted to extend his stay in a star hotel by a day earlier this month, he was told either to pay double the card rate or pack his bags. In a huff, he decided to check into a rival hotel. He could not. Simply because there was not a single star room in the city available. Its easier to find a Bengali who hates adda than a hotel room in Calcutta during winter, he grumbled.

 This fact is now borne out by figures the average room rate (ARR) in the city apparently hit an all-time high of Rs 12,800, on February 11, at Taj Bengal. One, this clearly establishes us as the most popular star destination for travellers in town. Second, a high ARR reflects a resurgent Bengal, with hotels being the first indicator of increased business activity, said Taljinder Singh, general manager, Taj Bengal.

 What this also does is highlight the need for more star hotels for which 1,000-1,200 rooms are coming up in four-five years and fuel the competitive fire over ARR count.

 ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers, for one, is quick to claim the image and ARR crown in Calcutta for the past two years. Our ARR has ranged between Rs 9,000 and Rs 12,000, while recording the most rapid growth, claimed a spokesperson for the Bypass hotel.

 Bengal is going through a rapid phase of industrialisation, thanks to the chief ministers efforts, boosting business travel and, therefore, the ARR, she adds.

 The grand old lady of Chowringhee also lays claim to the ARR crown. This is a one-off thing... We had once recorded an ARR of Rs 13,003, says Amitabh Rai, GM, The Oberoi Grand.

 The industry, as a whole, is bullish after a winter of content. Business and matrimony, seminars and cricket have have contributed to the house-full boom.

 The market in Calcutta is very strong and our hotel continues to lead and dominate... The rates are going to hit a high of $300 (Rs 13,200, approx) on a consistent basis in the next season, said Vijay Dewan, MD, The Park Hotels.

 Powerless over cuts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The power cuts will continue till August, the CESC declared on Friday, expressing its inability to improve the situation. 

 Restricted supply from the recently-formed West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company was causing a power shortage of 100 MW to 150 MW every evening, said the power utilitys executive director (generation), P.K. Basu.

 The CESC is switching off power in localities by rotation to ensure that no area has to go without electricity for a long time, said executive director (commercial mains) of the CESC D.K. Sen.

 To tide over the crisis for the next three months, the CESC has requested its 2.1 million consumers to cut down on the use of air-conditioners, washing machines and kitchen appliances in the evening. 

 The peak hour demand in the CESC-served areas is about 1,360 MW. The demand has increased by 40 MW since last year due to proliferation of housing estates and commercial establishments, according to the CESC officials.

 Undeclared air-conditioners in Posta, Sir Hariram Goenka Street, Canning Street and Bhowanipore are putting pressure on the transformers, increasing the chances of snags, said a CESC official.

 To meet the demand, we need about 480 MW daily from the state electricity distribution company, but it is unable to provide more than 280 MW to 300 MW on an average in the evening, said Basu.

 He claimed that the city would not face power problems for three to four years after August.

 The power department officials also said the situation would improve across the state from August.

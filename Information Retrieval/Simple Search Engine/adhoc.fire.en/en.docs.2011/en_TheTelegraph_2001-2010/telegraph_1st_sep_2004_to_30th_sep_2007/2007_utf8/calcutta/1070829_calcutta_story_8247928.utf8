 Puja organisers will have to obtain permission from police for collecting subscriptions from the public, the high court ruled on Tuesday.

 Even organisers of temple pujas will need police consent for collecting subscriptions. Each and every page of the subscription book has to bear the seal of approval of the police.

 Justice Soumitra Pal issued the order following a petition by Jayanta Das, of Dharmatala Sarbojanin Durga Puja Samity, Chandernagore.

 Abha Roy, who appeared for the state and the police, said the order covers all religious festivities from Durga to Shani puja.

 A senior police officer said: Following todays order, the organisers will have to get each page of their subscription books stamped by us.

 Petitioner Das had challenged the decision of the sub-divisional police officer, Chandernagore, not to allow his club to collect subscriptions from the public.

 The petitioner claimed that the puja was being organised in a temple compound since 2004 after obtaining no-objection certificates from the fire department and the local municipal authorities.

 But Justice Pal held that police permission is a must for collecting subscriptions and dismissed the petition.

 With Durga puja round the corner, senior officers said, all city police stations have started conveying the courts order to the puja organisers. The organisers have to seek police permission after getting no-objection papers from the fire department and the civic authorities, said an officer.

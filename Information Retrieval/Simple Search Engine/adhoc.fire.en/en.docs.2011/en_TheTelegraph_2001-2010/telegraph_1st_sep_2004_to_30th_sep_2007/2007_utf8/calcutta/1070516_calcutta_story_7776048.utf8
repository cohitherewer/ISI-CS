The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Summer is here, mango is on its way

 - UP SURPLUS FOR STATE LOW YIELD

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A low yield and late arrival had threatened to ruin Calcuttas annual date with the delicious summer fruit.

 But things are looking up and traders are hopeful that the city will get to savour its usual share of mango, thanks to a good harvest in Uttar Pradesh.

 The average daily arrival of 40 truckloads of mango will rise to 80 truckloads by the last week of May, said a trader in the wholesale fruit market in Mechhua.

 President of the Mechhua Fruit Merchants Association Mohammad Sohrab said the best quality of Himsagar and Langra, the two most favourite varieties in the city, will sell at Rs 20-30 a kg in the retail market. In the wholesale market, the price will vary from Rs 15 to Rs 20.

 Himsagar arrives in the city in mid-May and Langra in early-June. The UP Langra is likely to come by June 5, said Sohrab.

 There will also be two cultured varieties Amrapali and Mallika. We had distributed over six lakh saplings of Amrapali over the past six years and at least three lakh will start bearing fruit from this year, said Subrata Basu, deputy manager in the state food processing and horticulture corporation.

 Fruit merchants were initially apprehensive about their business as the yield in all mango-growing districts in the state was much less that what was expected.

 Bengal produces around 4.5 lakh metric tonnes of mango on an average every year, while in a good crop year, the figure goes up to six lakh metric tonnes. This year, the yield will not even touch four lakh metric tonnes, said Basu.

 But traders and mango-lovers need not worry, as surplus produce in UP will make up for the shortfall in state yield, said Sohrab.

 Calcutta consumes over 10 lakh tonnes of mango daily from May to July and the demand is rising by the year.

 Cabbie retrieves and returns bag

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Honesty track: Taxi driver Samir Burman

 A taxi driver played Good Samaritan on Monday by returning to its rightful owner a bag left behind in his vehicle on Saraswati puja.

 The cabbie, Samir Burman, had deposited the bag with Narkeldanga police station after he discovered it lying in the boot of his car. 

 But when told that the bag was still lying unclaimed in Narkeldanga thana six days later, Burman took the help of his wife, who works in the Lalbazar police headquarters, to locate the address of the passenger who had left the bag behind in his taxi.

 The bag belonged to an information technology professional, Kaushik Sen, who lives in Salt Lake. I am really touched by Burmanbabus honesty. He came to my house six days after Saraswati puja and returned the bag, said Sen, who works for Tata Consultancy Services, in Salt Lake.

 Police said the bag contained clothes, cosmetics and ritual material for Saraswati puja.

 I was in a hurry and was going to attend a puja at my relatives house at Picnic Garden, said Sen. 

 On reaching there, I realised that I had left the bag in the taxi. I had lost all hope of getting it back, he admitted.

 On Saraswati puja, Kaushikbabu and his family boarded my cab. While they were getting off, I didnt notice that they were not carrying their bag. The next afternoon, when I opened the car boot and saw the bag, I realised that it was Kaushikbabus, smiled Burman. 

 I deposited the bag with police. But it was lying unclaimed in the malkhana of Narkeldanga police station. With my wifes help, I located Kaushikbabus house and returned his bag, he added.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim, praising Burmans efforts, said that every day, police receive hundreds of complaints against taxi drivers. It was heartening to see one of them helping out police. Such efforts are laudable and always welcome, he smiled.

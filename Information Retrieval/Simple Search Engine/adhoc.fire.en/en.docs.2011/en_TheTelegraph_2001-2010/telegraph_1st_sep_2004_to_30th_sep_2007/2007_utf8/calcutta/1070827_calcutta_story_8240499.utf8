The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hit by bus, taken to hospital by driver

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man in his mid-30s was seriously injured after being knocked down by a private bus on APC Road, near Rajabazar, on Sunday, the fifth consecutive day of road mishaps in the city. 

 The driver took the injured man to NRS Hospital and fled after admitting him to the emergency ward. 

 The mishap took place in front of Rajabazar Science College in the afternoon, when Sanjay Das was crossing the road. The bus, plying on the Barrackpore-Khatikbazar route, hit him from behind.

 The bus was on the way to Barrackpore. Immediately after the mishap, the driver stopped the vehicle and took Das, who received serious injuries on his head, to hospital. By then, most of the passengers had got off the bus, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 The driver parked the bus in front of NRS and took Das to the emergency ward with the aid of his help. After examining the injured man, the doctors stated that his condition was critical. Hearing that, the driver and his help fled, leaving the bus in front of the hospital, said an officer of the traffic department.

 Singh said that tracing the driver would not be a problem. We will contact the bus-owner and find out from the depot who was driving the bus. Action will be taken against the driver, he said.

 Scrutiny of school prefix

 - Move to ensure only minority institutions enjoy rights

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government will introduce rigorous inspection to find out whether a school named after a saint is indeed run by Christian missionaries, school education minister Partha De said in the Assembly on Monday.

 The move will try to ensure that only schools run by the minorities enjoy the rights guaranteed to them in the Constitution.

 We will not allow all schools with names beginning with saint to enjoy minority rights. They have to establish their claim that they are run by Christian missionaries, said the minister during a debate on the school education budget.

 Schools run by Christian missionaries can follow their own academic, recruitment and admission policies. They can appoint brothers and sisters from various denominations as principals.

 De told the House that the minority schools will continue to enjoy the rights guaranteed to them in the Constitution and the state government will not interfere in their day-to-day administration and policies.

 However, every private English-medium school, including those run by the Christian missionaries, will have to maintain transparency in recruitment, he stressed.

 The schools are free to follow their own policies and select their own teachers. But the government must be told about the policy they are following, said the minister. 

 The government has been receiving complaints of unfair retrenchment of teachers in some private (non-Christian missionary run and non-Anglo Indian) schools. The current move will attempt to bring down the number of such complaints.

 De also told the House that the government has introduced life skill education in schools to create awareness about issues like AIDS and addiction. The government is also considering expansion of the scope of value-based education in school.

 Considering the rapid changes taking place in society, boys and girls must be made to understand their responsibility to others, said De.

 Earlier, Barry OBrien, the MLA representing the Anglo-Indian community, and Trinamul Congress legislator Sougata Roy had urged the government to focus more on value-based education in its education policy.

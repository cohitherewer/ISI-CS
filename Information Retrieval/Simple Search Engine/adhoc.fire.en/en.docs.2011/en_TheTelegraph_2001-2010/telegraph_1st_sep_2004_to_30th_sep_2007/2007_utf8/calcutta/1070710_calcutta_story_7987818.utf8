 Teachers in funds fraud cry

 - Lack of transparency in World Bank grant for facility upgrade

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The CPM-controlled Calcutta University Teachers Association (Cuta) has slapped embezzlement charges on a university committee, responsible for managing and disbursing funds under a World Bank project.

 The 150-year-old university was allotted Rs 30 crore under the Technical Education Quality Improvement Project (Tequip), with the purpose of improving infrastructure and research standards. Till date, the Tequip monitoring committee of the university has spent Rs 24 crore.

 We have found that some officials of our university, responsible for the World Bank project, are not maintaining transparency, said Biplab Chakraborty, the Cuta general secretary. 

 Last week, Cuta members held a demonstration on the College Street campus to protest lack of transparency in disbursal and use of funds. The aggrieved teachers also demanded a complete report on how the money has been spent.

 We have been told that the money has been spent on augmenting academic and research infrastructure. But we are yet to see the improvements, said a teacher.

 Though funds from Tequip are in use since 2004 Bengal was the last of 13 states to launch the project the immediate trigger behind the protest is a letter from the state-level unit, set up by the World Bank to facilitate the project.

 The unit has refused to allot fresh funds to Calcutta University because it has failed to submit the utilisation certificate of a portion of the last instalment of the funds, said a university source. 

 A demand of Rs 80 lakh was put forward to the universitys Tequip committee. With the state-level committee denying any fresh disbursal, teachers of various departments are forced to cancel their plans to attend international seminars and workshops. 

 According to a senior teacher, a considerable portion of the Rs 30-crore fund was earmarked for foreign tours of faculty members. But now, we are forced to cancel our plans, said an aggrieved teacher.

 Sushanta Sen, the dean of Calcutta Universitys technology faculty and chairman of the universitys Tequip committee, claimed that the state-level unit has not cited any specific reason for stopping the funds. 

 We have written to the unit, requesting it to state why it was not willing to release the Rs 80 lakh, Sen said.

 The teachers have also pointed out that though the World Bank had instructed the institution to float global tenders to purchase sophisticated computers and machines, the university had purchased sub-standard instruments from Calcutta-based companies.

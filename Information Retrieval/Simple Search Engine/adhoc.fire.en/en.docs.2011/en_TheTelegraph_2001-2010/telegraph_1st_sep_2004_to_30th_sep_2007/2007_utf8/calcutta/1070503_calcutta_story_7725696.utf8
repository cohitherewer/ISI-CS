 Boy, child go missing

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 18-month-old Tauqeer missing from Topsia 

 Two boys, an 18-month-old and a 10-year-old, have gone missing from Topsia over the past 72 hours. The toddler was last seen with a 13-year-old boy, who is also missing. The families are yet to receive ransom calls and fear that the children have been sold. 

 Around 1.45 pm on Monday, Mafiz Khan, a consultant at a rubber factory, handed over his son Tauqeer to a girl named Deepali, asking her to take the baby to his mother Nazma. Neighbours later saw local boy Babar take away Tauqeer. The children have not been seen since. 

 Deepali recalled: Babar walked up to me and asked for the child. The baby was reluctant, but the boy lured him with a toffee. I thought Babar would take Tauqeer for a stroll and handed him over.

 We have no idea where Tauqeer is. Police have not been able to offer us hope, said Mafiz. 

 I dont think this is a case of abduction for ransom. A month ago, Babar had taken away another child. The boy was forced to return the child after some of us spotted him roaming around in a park, alleged Mohammad Shakil, a local resident.

 It could be that Tauqeer has been taken away by a gang that employed Babar, he added.

 On Tuesday, 10-year-old Obidur Rahman of Topsia Second Lane went missing. He had stepped out of his home in a vest and trousers to visit a local shop. His father Mohammad Sirajuddin Obidur is a rubber factory employee.

 In both cases, we have informed the police stations, providing detailed descriptions of the missing boys. There has been no response till date, said a senior officer of Tiljala police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Filmi swing 

 in wedding season 

 - Good 

 ol vivah geet sammelan goes glam, with Bollywood 

 the flavour 

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 Rock n roll soniye Calcutta is dancing to the Bollywood tune this vivah season. Literally.

 The Agarwal household in Ballygunge comes alive to Khaike paan Banaraswala every evening for a full hour. This is not mere fun or fitness fad, but the serious business of the youngest sons sagai and sangeet, coming up in end-January.

 With the wedding weeks upon us, preparations are on in full swing, and the city is getting into the swing of things, filmi style.

 Four scanners, at least two moving heads, power cans, smoke machines, strobes, blaring music, glittering ensembles and a personalised storyline all that for a sangeet ceremony in your friendly neighbourhood.

 The good ol geet sammelan has gone glam, and how. From a string of back-to-back Rajasthani folk songs and an occasional conservative film song thrown in for respite, to Latino style pre-wedding dance bash, complete with a proper storyline, the D-day countdown just gets brighter by the season.

 And the man who makes most Calcuttans go through their paces at this time of the year is city-based choreographer Vishal Kanoi.

 Sangeet ceremonies are organised on a much larger scale now. They extend to much more than close family, entertainment becomes imperative... The idea is to get guests so involved that they do not venture out to the food area, says Vishal, whose sangeet themes range from Hum Tum and Don to Munnabhai and Mughal-e-Azam. 

 Since everything in a wedding is taking the Bollywood route from designer lehngas to lavish sets the sangeet is following suit.

 People relate to filmi moves on the stage like nothing else. We love to dance like our favourite stars and if an expert can recreate some cinematic magic, then the pre-wedding show is bound to be a super hit, says Akash Sahni, who arranged a Bollywood-inspired sangeet for his sister last year. 

 Films apart, the small screen also comes up with quirky contributions, from STARs Khichdi to random news reports to Laughter Challenge rib-ticklers.

 Every season sees its pop picks, from screens big and small. This winter, Dil mein baji guitar, Khaike paan... and Rock n roll soniye figure high on the must-play list.

 The final stage sees a pile of props and lots of acting but this is how the sangeet drama unfolds. Formalities decided, Vishal gets into the process of making amateur kids look like professionals, which is sometimes a month-long tedious task. 

 It is essential to get inputs from the family about the couples likes and dislikes, their personalities and special situations. Then I like to blow it out of proportion and exaggerate it. The theme is decided, songs are picked and then remixed and edited to convert into a medley. It is almost like a musical the dance carries the script forward, connected with visual clippings, commentary and interactive scenes, explains Vishal. 

 Some filmi signature steps are a must, but not too bold (read, no Beedi song please). Its a family do, after all. Functions like a sangeet are extremely special, and need an element of creative fun in them. Also, the days spent practising the moves is almost like a mini party, getting together everyone from the family, says Uday Modi, gearing up for a family function choreographed by Vishal.

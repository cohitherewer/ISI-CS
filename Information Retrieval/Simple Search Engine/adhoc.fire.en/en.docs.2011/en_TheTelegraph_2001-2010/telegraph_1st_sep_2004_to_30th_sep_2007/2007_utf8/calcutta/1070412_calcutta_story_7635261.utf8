 Cocking a snook at the governments vow to protect waterbodies and greenery, yet another open stretch, including a pond, in Ballygunge is on verge of being illegally converted for realty. 

 The area is close to Bijon Setu and comprises the plots 1A Cornfield Road, 17 Jamir Lane and 203, 205A and 207A Rashbehari Avenue. It has a park, a playground and a waterbody with a kuchcha connector.

 What further raises eyebrows is the fact that the land under threat belongs to the government but is being passed off as private property. 

 In the early 80s, the government had acquired about 25,000 sq m with notifications published in Calcutta Gazette. It was transferred to the Corporation in 1993 for development as playground/ park/ road etc in the public interest.

 A promoter has now sunk his teeth into a large chunk of the land, allegedly chopping nearly 20 big trees and filling up the pond with the claim that the land belongs to a private owner. 

 A complaint was lodged with Gariahat police station in March against a promoter for systematically filling up the pond situated at the south-east corner of 17 Jamir Lane. But nothing came of it.

 Since 1982, we have been demanding that the land be declared a park as was promised when Ekdalia Park was sacrificed for constructing Bijon Setu, said actor Swarup Dutta, who lives in the area. Dutta is spearheading the movement by Charlie Chaplin Park Committee to stop the land grab. 

 How can a public property be suddenly converted to private land? exclaimed Deb Kumar Bose, local resident and former chairman of West Bengal Pollution Control Board.

 While the pond is being filled up over two years, now the accent is on the playground. The promoter has even posted guards preventing people from using the kuchcha road. 

 When Metro visited the area on Wednesday, the promoter could not be contacted. A board bearing the name Shree Shree Sitaram Jew with the address 1A Cornfield Road was found pinned to a tree at the entrance. The pond was clearly in the final stage of fill-up.

 The area definitely is public property. The CMC even built a pay-and-use toilet there. The ground was supposed to have been converted to a park, said Debasish Kumar, ex-chairman of the borough in which the property is located.

 The residents may have complained to the CMC but local councillor Rajib Deb denied knowledge of a fill-up going on.

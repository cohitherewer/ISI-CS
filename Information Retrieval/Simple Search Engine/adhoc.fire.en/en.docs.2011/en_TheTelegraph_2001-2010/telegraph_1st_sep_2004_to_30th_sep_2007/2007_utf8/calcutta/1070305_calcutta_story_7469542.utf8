 Four ill in gas leak

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three women and a man fell ill on Sunday afternoon after inhaling fumes coming out of a factory in Garden Reach.

 Reports of a gas leak from the closed ice factory at Bakikol Second Lane caused panic in the Dhankethi area, said police. Fumes from two gas cylinders kept in the factory caused breathing trouble, complained residents of the area.

 Sajida Khatoon, 55, Mumtaz Begum, 32, Babita Yasmin, 30, and Altaf Ali, 45, had to be admitted to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. They are stable.

 The factory has been closed for one-and-a-half-years. One of the cylinders kept inside, containing ammonia, was leaking. We will find out if another cylinder was also leaking, said officer-in-charge of Garden Reach police station Ismail Mondal.

 The post-mortem report of Rizwanur Rahman was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Tuesday. It provided details of the injuries on his body.

 We will consult experts to determine whether Rizwanur was killed after being hit by a train or killed and dumped beside the tracks. We also need to find out if he jumped in front of a speeding train or was pushed on the tracks, said an investigator.

 The officers on Tuesday morning visited the spot between Dum Dum and Bidhannagar railway stations, where the body was found. They looked for clues along the tracks. We also spoke to the government railway police officers, added the investigator. 

 The officers have collected Rizwanurs cellphone records from the service provider. We are going through each incoming and outgoing call. We have also contacted the service provider to find out the contents of SMS texts sent by Rizwanur to his friends, Priyanka and her family members, said another investigator. The officers also summoned Rizwanurs eldest brother Rukbanur to Bhabani Bhavan and spoke to him for more than eight hours.

 The family on Tuesday performed Chaharam (a ritual of mourning) at their Tiljala Lane house in Karaya. Neighbours also gathered outside the house and prayed for Rizwanur.

 We recited the Quran and prayed for his soul. Its very difficult to believe that he is no longer with us, said Zahida, Rizwanurs sister-in-law.

 Its very sad that his widow is not with us even today. We do not have any idea about her whereabouts and the police have not been able to produce her. They are doing this deliberately, as they are scared that she will spill the beans and they will be in trouble, she added.

 n Senior IPS officer N.K. Singh was quoted in Metro on September 25 as saying that he had asked deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh to work out a solution in the Rizwanur case. Another senior officer had asked Singh to sort out the problem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mentor of the Maharaj

 Calcuttan of the Week 

 Name: Snigdhangshu Shekhar Mitra or Tuntuda (picture by Anindya Shankar Ray) 

 Claim to fame: Sourav Gangulys first coach

 A pioneer: This former batsman brought formal cricket coaching to the southern parts of the city when he joined South Calcutta Club in Deshapriya Park as a cricket coach. 

 Famous students: Tuntuda, 62, has taught batting to a host of glitzy names. Sourav Ganguly, Gopal Bose, Raja Venkat, Devang Gandhi, Avik Mitra, Naresh Ojha and Rajesh Dani are the more famous of his students. 

 In two stints as a coach, Tuntuda has helped East Bengal win 31 trophies. The boys played well and the results followed. It has got nothing do with me, he says with a dismissive laugh. 

 Tryst with the Prince: Tuntuda first met Sourav as a coach at the Bengal under-15 nets. I had told Chandi (Ganguly) that very day that his son was to become a great player, he recounts. 

 Tuntuda, however, believes that Snehashis Ganguly had a better batting technique than Sourav. But few are as gritty as Maharaj. The way he sweated it out to force a comeback to the Indian team was exemplary.

 Now: Tuntuda is the chief coach at the nascent cricket academy jointly run by the Howrah Sporting Club and Vivekananda Sports Club at Doomorjola, Howrah.

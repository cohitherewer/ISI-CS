 Abhishek Agarwal, 29, sells home and fitness equipment online. The graduate in computer applications decided early that he wouldnt pursue the family business.

 Vineet Chandgotia, 31, has been selling books, games and CDs on the Internet for eight months. It is an extension of his book distributorship.

 Rajiv Bose, 40, has been involved in online retailing for four years. He and his wife sell gift items on portals like Rediff and Sify. 

 Calcutta is waking up to cyber shopping. And more businessmen are going online to meet the demand.

 For most of the traders, selling on the Internet is a way of supplementing income. Many feel it is an inevitable step. Almost every aspect of life is finding an online extension. Retailing on the Internet is a must to survive in the market, says Chandgotia.

 According to Manish Agarwal, the vice-president (marketing) of Rediff.com, Online retailing is about hosting unusual items.Agarwal is a good example. The first item he sold online was a lactometer, which measures the richness of milk. He was pleasantly surprised by the number of people who wanted to buy it online. 

 One of Boses most popular services is midnight delivery, where cakes, flowers and champagne are delivered to the desired address at the stroke of midnight. Most of the customers are BPO workers.

 Achintya Ghosh, 38, who sells IT accessories sourced from Ganesh Chandra Avenue on the Internet, says: It will be more expensive for a customer to buy these items offline, because of the transportation cost. He is planning to offer terracotta artefacts from Bankura for sale.

 Abhishek closes between 450 and 500 deals a month while Bose handles as many orders in a day. Some of them have had customers in remote towns in India and even in Europe.

 Online shopping in Calcutta accounts for five per cent of eBays business, says Deepa Thomas, the manager (corporate communications) of the company.

 Chandgotia feels that portals such as eBay are useful for small businessmen, who cannot invest on a website. 

 According to a Rediff.com official, gift items and books have sold better in Calcutta in the past three months than in other metros. The items most in demand in the city include gadgets and lifestyle items.

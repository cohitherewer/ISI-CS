 Father P.C. Mathew, the principal of St Xaviers College, Calcutta, has completed 50 years as a Jesuit. And what better occasion to celebrate it than Teachers Day.

 On Wednesday evening, the St Xaviers College Calcutta Alumni Association organised a programme to felicitate Father Mathew, along with Father Albert Huart, who completed 50 years as a Jesuit priest.

 It is the jubilee celebration of eight people which also marks the 10th death anniversary of Mother Teresa, said Suma Mukherjee, the vice-president of the association.

 Abdus Sattar, the state minister for minorities development and welfare, was present on the occasion, along with teachers and students, past and present.

 I want to thank all the Xaverians for making this possible, as well as the teachers on whose behalf I am accepting this honour, said Father Mathew.

 Students of the mass communication department screened a documentary they have prepared on the life of Father Mathew, in which the principal talks about his influences, achievements and relationship with the college, teachers and students.

 The association also released a coffee-table book Recollecting 50 Years of Service on the life of Father Mathew. The book talks about the good things, and also the not so good things, about him.

 The alumni association handed over a cheque for Rs 20 lakh to the Calcutta provincial head of the Jesuits, Father George Pattery, for the training of young Jesuits. The goodwill and cooperation of the students of St Xaviers College is amazing, said Father Huart, a former vice-principal of St Xaviers College, who received the cheque on behalf of the provincial head.

 The evening came to an end with music director Debojyoti Mishra taking the stage.

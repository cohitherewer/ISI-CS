 Cops suffer assault rerun

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Barely 24 hours after an assault on policemen by two drunk men at Gol Park, another drunk duo, in mid-30s, beat up a detective department officer in the same area on Monday night. The officers wife was also abused when the couple protested against rash driving by the duo.

 The men involved in the earlier incident went scot-free, but a number of charges, including non-bailable ones, were slapped on Bapi Debnath and Sanjay Ghosh. A case was registered with Lake police station and the two were produced in court on Tuesday.

 According to the police, the incident took place at Gol Park around 9 pm, when Indra Kanjilal, a sub-inspector in the watch section of detective department, was returning home with his wife. 

 The car Debnath and Ghosh were in jumped a traffic signal and almost hit the officer. Kanjilal protested and asked the driver to be careful, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 The two hurled abuses at Kanjilal. When the officer disclosed his identity, they got off the car and continued abusing him, said an officer of the detective department. The situation worsened when Kanjilals wife tried to intervene. 

 The two hit the officer and as he slumped on the ground, passed lewd remarks at his wife. Local residents rushed to the spot and informed the police, the officer added.

 On Sunday, two policemen stopped a couple of men who were riding a motorcycle recklessly. They pretended to be officers of Gariahat police station. When the officers asked for an identity proof, they thrashed them with a helmet and hurled abuses for over half-an-hour. 

 The two were taken to Lake police station and released after a warning.

 Rameshwar Das, a shop-owner at Gol Park, said: The two who were picked up by police on Sunday returned to the area after some time. They were shouting that police could not do anything to them. Such incidents are common here. Police should take stern action against the culprits.

 Some parents of the students of Kendriya Vidyalaya and Cossipore English Medium School have decided to move court against an order of Gun and Shell Factory, Cossipore, preventing their entry into the campus through the main gate.

 The parents also blocked Dum Dum Road for 15 minutes on Thursday to protest the decision.

 Both schools are located on the campus of Gun and Shell Factory. The factory authorities have announced that as part of a security revamp, students and their parents would not be allowed to enter the campus through the main gate.

 They are, however, free to enter through the rear gates, said an official of the Ordnance Factory Board.

 We have no alternative but to move court, said a parent, who asked not to be named. The two roads leading to the rear gates are perpetually waterlogged, because of overflowing drains of the adjacent housing estates.

 Another parent said both the rear gates are narrow and there could be an accident when 5,000-odd students rush out after school hours.

 We wanted to discuss the issue with the factory board authorities, but they turned down our proposal. They are harassing us and our children on the pretext of security, said yet another parent.

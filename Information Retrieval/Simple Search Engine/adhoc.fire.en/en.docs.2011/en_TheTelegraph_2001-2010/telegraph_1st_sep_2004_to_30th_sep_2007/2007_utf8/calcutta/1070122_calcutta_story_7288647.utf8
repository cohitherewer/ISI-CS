 SANJAY MANDAL

 Fly to Rome from Calcutta and return for Rs 15,000.

 Travelling to Europe has never been cheaper, with the Italian carrier Eurofly launching direct flights between Delhi and Rome on Tuesday last week.

 Passengers from Calcutta can avail of the flights at Rs 15,000, plus taxes, for a round trip in the economy class, said L.M. Khosla, area manager, India, Eurofly.

 The fare will be valid till March 31.

 The airline is flying 256-seater Airbus A330s between the two capitals thrice a week each way.

 Emirates, too, has reduced its fares on the Calcutta-London and Calcutta-Frankfurt routes. According to aviation industry sources, other airlines may follow suit.

 Emirates has lowered its fare on the Calcutta-London-Calcutta, via Dubai, route from Rs 20,000, plus tax, to Rs 18,500, plus tax. On the Calcutta-Frankfurt-Calcutta sector, the fare has come down from Rs 21,000, excluding tax, to Rs 18,500, excluding tax. The offer will be valid till March 31.

 Eurofly has tied up with Kingfisher airline for flying passengers from Calcutta to Delhi, on way to Rome.

 Khosla said the aggressive pricing of Eurofly, coupled with its Indian cuisine and in-flight entertainment, would boost Rome-bound traffic by 10 per cent in two years.

 Competition on the Calcutta-Europe sector is stiff because of the recent capacity increase, following the launch of Lufthansa in Calcutta and Eurofly in Delhi, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India. With the fares being reduced, the number of tourists to the UK and other European countries is expected to increase by five per cent this year.

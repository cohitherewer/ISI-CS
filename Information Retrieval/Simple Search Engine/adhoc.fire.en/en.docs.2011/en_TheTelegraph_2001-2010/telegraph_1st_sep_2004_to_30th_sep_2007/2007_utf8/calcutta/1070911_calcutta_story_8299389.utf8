The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rogue auto driver arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The rogue autorickshaw driver who harassed Saheli Mitra during a ride on Sunday afternoon was arrested on Monday morning. Raju Sardar was booked on charges of abusing a woman, driving recklessly and smoking on a public transport.

 Saheli, who has been working with The Telegraph for 11 years, had noted down the autos licence number and lodged a complaint with New Alipore police station. Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner (south), directed his men to track down the driver and slap charges on him based on the allegations.

 We found out the address of the auto owner from the traffic department database. He told us that Sardar was from Sardarpara in Baruipur. We raided his house at dawn on Monday and picked him up, said Swadhin Sarkar, the officer-in-charge of the police station.

 Sardar confessed during interrogation. He was produced in court and given bail.

 Saheli had boarded the autorickshaw, plying on the Behala-Rashbehari route, in front of the State Bank of Indias New Alipore branch. Being a patient of allergic asthma, she requested the driver to put out the cigarette he was smoking, referring to the ban on smoking in public places, including public transport.

 The driver not only refused to stop smoking but also started blowing the smoke on Sahelis face. He also abused her, all the while driving with only his left hand, the other hand holding the cigarette.

 After the protest, Sardar started brushing his left hand against Sahelis waist. When she asked him to stop, the driver abused her again.

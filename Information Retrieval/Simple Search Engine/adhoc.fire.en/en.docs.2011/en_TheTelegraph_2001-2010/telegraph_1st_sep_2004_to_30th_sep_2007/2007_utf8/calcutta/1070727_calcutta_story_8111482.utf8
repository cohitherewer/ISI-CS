 Held for maid torture 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A couple were arrested at Sardar Para, in the Regent Park area, on Thursday, after a local club complained against them for allegedly torturing their 15-year-old maid, Gouri Sasmal.

 According to police, about nine months ago, Gouri, a resident of Digha, was employed as a maid in the house of Samit Mitra, who works in a private bank. 

 Gouri was to look after the Mitras two minor daughters. She is quite frail and Mitras wife Iti forced her to do all kinds of chores. If Gouri failed to carry out her orders, Iti would beat her with a rubber tube and scald her with red-hot tongs. She even kicked Gouri if she ever got up late. She was forced to get up at 5am, although she never got the chance to go to bed before 11pm. Iti did not allow Gouri to go out of the house. But Gouri told us of her sufferings whenever she got the chance, said Kajal Karmakar, a neighbour of the Mitras.

 Around noon on Thursday, when members of the club, Sangathan Samity, were playing carom, Gouri came running and told them that Iti had beaten her and threatened to kill her if she fell ill.

 She was trembling. Marks of torture were visible on her hands and legs. We took her to MR Bangur Hospital for treatment and informed Regent Park thana about the incident, said Munna Tewari, a club member.

 Superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) Praveen Kumar said the girls medical report was awaited.

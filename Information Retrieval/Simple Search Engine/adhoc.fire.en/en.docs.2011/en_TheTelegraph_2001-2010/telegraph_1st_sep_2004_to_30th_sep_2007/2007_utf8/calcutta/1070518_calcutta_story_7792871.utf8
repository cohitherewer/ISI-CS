 The man behind the killer wheels, which took the life of a 14-year-old school-bound boy on Wednesday, had a history of creating trouble in the area. 

 Subhendu Roy was out on a similar mischievous mission when the car he was driving on Wednesday morning rammed into Peejush Banerjee, his twin brother Prasun and mother Sunanda.

 A Class VIII student of Chetla Boys High School, Peejush died on the spot. 

 Subhendu has told us that he, along with friends Uttam Lamba and driver of the Maruti Zen Kamal Bhattacharya, were out on a joyride He has admitted that it was his habit, said an officer of Alipore police station. 

 He and Uttam met up with Kamal at the garage, where the car was sent for servicing, and set out on their cruise. 

 According to local residents, the sight of Subhendu speeding on a motorcycle was common in and around Chetla Park, Rakhal Das Auddy Road and Gopalnagar Road. 

 He was most active during school hours and could be spotted around Chetla Girls School, New Alipore College and Asutosh College, said Raju Ghosh, a Chetla resident. 

 Failing to bear with his ways, the residents had filed a specific complaint at Chetla police station six months ago. 

 We are aware that a complaint was filed against Subhendu. An inquiry is on to ascertain why no action was taken despite the complaint, said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee. 

 Police are also checking Subhendus antecedents before framing the final chargesheet against him and Uttam. Subhendus father works in a private firm. He is a college dropout and unemployed But of late, he has been maintaining a flashy lifestyle, said a neighbour of Subhendu.

 Some neighbours have also linked Subhendu to a section of Trinamul Congress leaders in the area. Thats why he had a free run and police did not take any action, they said. 

 Police have charged Subhendu and Uttam with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code. The duo was produced in Alipore court on Thursday and remanded in police custody till May 21.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fliers suffer as facilities are few

 - Airport infrastructure stretched by rise in number of flights and passengers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Time: 10 am

 Place: Security

 hold area of the airports domestic terminal

 Scene: Hundreds of passengers standing in queues in front of the security check counters 

 This has been the scene at the domestic terminal of the airport every day for over a year. The number of airlines and passengers using the airport may be going up steadily, but the facilities remain static. 

 Over the past year, the count of passengers at the airport has registered a 30 per cent growth, but the number of security counters to cater to them has not gone up from three. Inadequate manpower remains another problem.

 The constraints could have cost city-based IT professional Judhajit Sen Majumdar his laptop and two cellphones. Last Friday, the X-ray machine had gobbled up the gadgets during the final security check for a flight to Bangalore. Sen Majumdar had placed the items on the conveyor belt of the machine, never to see them again. 

 The investigating authorities are clueless about the incident. We are continuing with our probe, was all an officer of North 24-Parganas police would say on Wednesday. 

 The low airfares are attracting more and more passengers. All the security counters are overcrowded during the rush hours, said chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India Anil Punjabi.

 There is a mad rush at the airport, with too many flights taking off around the same time. There is an urgent need for the number of security counters to be increased. I have been flying for more than 30 years but have never seen such chaos, stated frequent flier Satyajit Burman, a businessman. 

 Between putting a baggage on the conveyor belt of the X-ray machine for scanning and collecting it on the other side after being frisked by security personnel, the gap could be as long as 10 minutes, according to Burman.

 One has to wait for being frisked, even after the baggage has been scanned. It lies unattended on the tray. There are very few Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel around. Anyone can pick up the baggage and disappear, claimed Burman. 

 The authorities have spent crores on upgrade of passenger facilities at the airport over the past year, but the plan to increase the number of security check counters and CISF personnel is yet to be implemented. 

 To avoid congestion in the security hold on the ground floor, five X-ray machines will be installed in two security holds on the first floor, said a senior official of the airport.

 The Airports Authority of India has also sought deployment of additional CISF personnel in the airports security hold area, added the official. 

 An additional escalator will be installed to help passengers reach the security check counters upstairs without any inconvenience, stated the official.

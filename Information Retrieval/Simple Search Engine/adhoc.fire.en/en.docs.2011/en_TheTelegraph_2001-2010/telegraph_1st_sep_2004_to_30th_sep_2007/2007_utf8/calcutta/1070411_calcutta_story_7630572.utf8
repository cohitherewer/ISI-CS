 In the way: A tree lies

 uprooted on the street, waiting to be cut to size and carried off 

 Apropos the report Laptop, cellphones vanish at security check, March 7, it is distressing that expensive gadgets belonging to an IT professional went missing from the security enclosure of the airport. 

 What is even more disturbing is how the airport officials are trying to wash their hands off the matter by saying that hand baggage is the responsibility of the passenger. When a hand baggage is put on the conveyor belt of the X-ray machine, is it not under the temporary custody of the security personnel? Are they not responsible for handing the baggage back to the passenger at the other end of the machine? It should certainly be so because the passenger and baggage follow different routes. 

 The report says that the passenger was shown clippings from the closed circuit camera. If that has shown him putting the laptop and his cellphones on the X-ray conveyor belt for screening, then the authorities are definitely guilty of losing the items. The authorities should compensate the passenger. 

 Ashim Choudhury,

 Mandeville Gardens. 

 Timber is a major industry in areas around Calcutta. No wonder, trees are regularly chopped down in the city to provide the raw material. The news of tree felling is not getting proper coverage in the media. The state government should impose curbs on the industry and ensure that young trees are not cut. 

 In the districts, members of the panchayat in connivance with the local goons cut trees planted on government and public land. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Hooghly. 

 Apropos the report A tree uprooted, March 3,

 it is disturbing to learn that a huge tree was uprooted on Red Road during

 a thunderstorm. Old and gigantic trees are standing menacingly on the sides

 of many roads. Since these might collapse on pedestrians and vehicles during

 storms, I request the civic body to cut them and plant new ones in their

 place. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia.

 It is heartening that the green fair culture is spreading (Green fair under threat, March 3). The importance of green fairs has increased considerably in view of the rise in pollution. The fairs should also be held in the districts. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala.

 Apropos the report Traffic police guide for a good driving, March 7, it is a matter of delight that the traffic police are about to publish a guidebook for drivers. Hopefully, the move will spread awareness and prevent violation of traffic norms. The police authorities should publish the book in Bengali, English and Hindi, even if they have to charge money for it. 

 R.K. Halder,

 Bankim Pally. 

 It is good to know that police are going to release

 a book on road rules and tips for safe driving. It will also provide information

 about the city traffic guards. Many drivers in the city do not know the basic

 rules of traffic nor do they care to do so. Mishaps also occur due to careless

 behaviour by pedestrians, such as talking on the cellphone while crossing

 the road. The cops should bring out another guidebook for pedestrians. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake.

 Apropos the report Even Blair shuns beacon, March 7, the politicians in India need to be ashamed of their behaviour. They take advantage of their position even when they are just driving on the road. The high court must intervene to put an end to their habit of using beacons. 

 R. Bag, 

 Hooghly. 

 Apropos the report To use water, go by purse, March 5, the proposal to instal meters for measuring the use of water in households is logical and should be implemented immediately for delivery of better civic services. 

 But what happens to the numerous taps being installed on the streets by political parties to win votes? Gallons of water are wasted through the taps every day for lack of a control device. These taps are so close to each other that people hardly have to walk a few feet to come across one. Will these taps go dry after the introduction of water tax? Slum-dwellers need their water but can we be taxed for their wastage? 

 Anindya Kundu,

 N.K. Ghosal Road. 

Apropos the report Five of family die in car crash, March 5, the death of five members of two Chinese families in a road mishap was heartbreaking. There are no words to console the survivors of the catastrophe except to pray they have the strength and courage to face life. 

 Purnima Vasudeva,

 Rowland Road. 

 Apropos Blind chess whiz has no study funds, March 2, lack of financial support has always hit budding sportsperson in India. It is Dibakar Pals will power that made him excel in chess despite blindness. He believes that there is light at the end of the tunnel; its upto the authorities to show him light. 

 Sudipta Sur,

 Ramgarh.

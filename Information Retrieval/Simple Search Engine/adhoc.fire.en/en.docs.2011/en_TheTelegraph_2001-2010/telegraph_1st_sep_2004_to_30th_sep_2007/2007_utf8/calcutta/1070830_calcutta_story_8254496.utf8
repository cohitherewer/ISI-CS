The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Culture address in decay 

 2 Cathedral Road. Cradle of creativity. Symbol of stagecraft. Steeped in the arts. Meeting ground of masters.

 2 Cathedral Road. Waterlogged. Woefully ill-lit. Cracked roofs and broken walls. Museum shut and treasures rotting.

 Welcome to the Academy of Fine Arts. The crumbling crucible of culture.

 The Academy needs immediate 

 attention. But given the deadlock between the board of trustees 

 and the governing committee, there is little hope for the 

 famous address.

 The Academy has an annual income 

 of Rs 50 lakh, excluding donations from well-wishers. Around 

 Rs 24 lakh is spent a year on staff salary, Rs 3 lakh on 

 electricity bill, Rs 2 lakh on telephone bill and another 

 Rs 2 lakh on miscellaneous expenditure.

 The rest is deposited into 

 the account of the board of trustees. Yet, maintenance has 

 been negligible at the 74-year-old Academy.

 Metro visited the one-acre campus to try and make sense of the mess.

 LADY RANU MOOKERJEE AUDITORIUM

 The 731-seat auditorium threw open its doors on February 28, 1971, with Bohurupee staging Pagla Ghora.

 Flashpoint: The authorities have pushed up the rent by Rs 1,000. For instance, the rent for a morning or a matinee show is up from Rs 3,750 to Rs 4,700. How can they raise the rent without undertaking any basic repairs, is the cry from theatre groups.

 Situation report: Water seeps from the roof and trickles on to the stage. A portion of the back wall has been damaged. Cracks have appeared on the roof and the floor. The walls need a fresh coat of paint, the chairs are broken and the curtains need to be replaced. The stage stands the risk of a cave-in, with cracks appearing on the wooden planks. Water leaking from the back wall seeps through the cracks.

 The auditorium is in appalling condition. Theres not enough light and the fire-safety arrangement is poor. Theres just one entry-exit point, which is dangerous in an emergency, says theatre veteran Rudraprasad Sengupta.

 Waterlogging has been a major concern. Water enters the auditorium but its worst when the underbelly of the stage gets flooded. Its very difficult to drain out the water, says Bulbul Roy, the joint secretary of the governing committee.

 Blame game: The auditorium is caught in the tussle between the board of trustees and the governing committee. Our hands are tied. The annual income and donations from various quarters are deposited with the board, which doesnt sanction money for any development work, says an office-bearer of the governing committee.

 Our expenditure is equal to the annual income of Rs 50 lakh, claims Ashok Mukherjee, the acting chairman of the board of trustees. But well do something soon, as next year is the Academys 75th birth anniversary, he promises.

 MUSEUM

 The museum on the first floor is a mini treasure trove 35 paintings by Rabindranath Tagore, apart from a few sketches, the manuscript of Bhanusingher Padabali, Lady Ranus letters (to Tagore and her relatives) and her collection of Kashmiri shawls and Baluchari saris, paintings from medieval Bengal, miniature paintings from Rajasthan and contemporary Indian art.

 Situation report: The doors are shut for the past two months. Theres no sign of a reopening. The artefacts and documents are rotting inside the locked room with no preservation measures in place.

 Blame game: The museum has more than 2,700 artefacts but theres no proper security. A few manuscripts went missing some months ago and the museum has since been under lock and key. We wont reopen unless we can arrange for proper security, says board chairman Mukherjee.

 The governing committee cites lack of maintenance as the major problem. One of the walls of the museum has been completely damaged by water seepage. The valuables, worth crores, will be damaged unless there is proper airing, spraying and other treatment very soon, warns Ashit Paul, the vice-president of the governing committee.

 The present members have no sense of art restoration. If the museum remains closed, fungus will destroy major works of art. Its a shame, rues artist Suvaprasanna.

 THE GALLERIES

 The five galleries are rented out for art and craft exhibitions.

 Situation report: Greeting you at the entrance to the gallery is a tottering life-sized statue tied to a shrub with ropes. Another sculpture leans against a pillar for support. 

 Inside the gallery, betel-stained sculptures lie in a corner. A few paintings in the office room are coated with dust. Others are dumped in the rear of the gallery.

 The lighting arrangement falls far short of the mark. A wall in the North Gallery is in bad shape. Artists from abroad are keen to display their works here, but since the galleries are not centrally air-conditioned, we turn them down, says Bulbul Roy.

 Blame game: We have been allotted Rs 25 lakh from former member of Parliament Bharati Roys fund to renovate two galleries. We have discussed the proposal with the PWD but we are not being able to proceed, as the board hasnt given the go-ahead, claims governing committee vice-president Paul.

 We are planning the renovation project, counters board chairman Mukherjee.

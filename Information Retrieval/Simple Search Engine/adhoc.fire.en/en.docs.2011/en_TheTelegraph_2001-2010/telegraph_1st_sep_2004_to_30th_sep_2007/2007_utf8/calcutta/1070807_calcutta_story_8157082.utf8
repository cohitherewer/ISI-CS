 Coaching centres in scam glare 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Two coaching centres in Bhowanipore and Gariahat are under the police scanner for their alleged links with medical entrance scam kingpins Ranvijay Pathak and Mihir Jha. 

 The institutes specialise in offering tuition to joint entrance examination (JEE) aspirants. They brought out advertisements claiming high success rate of their students.

 The third institute in Calcutta, whose workings the investigators are looking into, downed shutters a few months back. 

 Statements by Piyush Kanti Basu about his contacts and how he came in touch with Jha set the officers on the trail of the coaching centres.

 Basu, a former student of RG Kar Medical College, told the investigators that he was approached by an agent of a JEE-coaching centre in 2005 while collecting the entrance test forms for his friends son from a bank. The agent introduced him to Jha, Basu claimed. 

 Jha didnt know that Basus registration had been cancelled for performing an illegal abortion. We are interrogating them to find out the extent of their association. It is clear that Basu worked for Jha, said Ajoy Kumar, the city detective chief. 

 The investigators have learnt that Jha offered Basu the chance to teach in his institute and offered him a handsome amount for getting students to enrol in the institute. Basu didnt take up the offer, opting to work as assistant to surgeons in nursing homes.

 A year later, in 2006, Basu met an agent of another JEE coaching centre while waiting for a bus near Ujjala cinema in Kalighat. The man asked him to help out a candidate. Basu took the candidate to Jha. 

 The police officers have decided to grill Jha and Pathak separately to determine how far their network had spread. The investigators also want to find out how the two would get the dummies to appear for the candidates.

 It now seems that the racket did not get dummies only from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Dummies may have been hired from the city too, said Kumar. Jha has deleted most of the records from his laptop.

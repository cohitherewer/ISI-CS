 Lend me your ear 

 What does one do to lodge a complaint against the 

 ear-splitting decibel level of autorickshaw music? A reader 

 finds out

 Save My Space 

 The problem

 Many of us are victims of the deafening noise that is called music and played in autorickshaws all over the city. Close to 50,000 autorickshaws ply in the city, a substantial portion of which play the music to the utter discomfort of passengers. Complaints fall on deaf years.

 The impact 

 First, the continuous blurting of chartbusters within such small space affects the ears of the passengers tremendously, especially those occupying the back seat. They sit within one foot of the sound-boxes. Noise pollution has a long-term impact over the ears, a danger that regular auto-users, including children, are exposed to.

 The autos, the vehicle that lacks discipline the most on city roads, run a great risk of meeting with accidents when they play music at a high pitch. The noise prevents drivers from hearing other vehicles hooting. They are often distracted by the music, too. 

 Complaint and result

 Though I have suffered this problem for years, I could never find out the competent authority is to lodge a complaint. I complained several times to the traffic police about the matter but with little result. When I pointed out that according to the noise pollution Act of 2000, the responsibility of controlling noise violations lie with the police, they tended to look in the other direction. A few verbal complaints to Pollution Control Board were of little use. Recently, I lodged a complaint with Biswajit Mukherjee, member secretary of the state level noise monitoring committee of the state environment department and am awaiting response.

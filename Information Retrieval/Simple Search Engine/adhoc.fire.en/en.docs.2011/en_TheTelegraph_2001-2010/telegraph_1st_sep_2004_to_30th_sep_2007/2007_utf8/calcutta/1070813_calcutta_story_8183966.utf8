 Sudden impact of death at doorstep

Afzal Alam was about to leave on his sales rounds when he heard a loud explosion.

 Rushing out, the 26-year-old was too shocked to react to what he saw. A few yards from Queens Mansion, on Park Street, where he lives, lay younger brother Aftab Hussain Ansari bathed in blood. Shards of glass were strewn all around.

 He was bleeding profusely as several shards had pierced his body. The back of his head was blown off, said Afzal, crying inconsolably.

 Aftab, 24, had gone to a local market. He was waiting in front of the McDonalds outlet to cross the road on his way back when the explosion occurred.

 My brother was lying on the road but nobody came forward to help us. Even the sergeants refused to touch him. We somehow managed to take him to hospital, though he was dead by then, wept Afzal.

 Afzals mother Rauzon Khatoon turned hysterical on hearing the news of her younger sons death.

 Aftab, like Afzal, was in sales, working for a local cosmetics company. Their father, Mohammad Allauddin, is temporarily employed with the LIC.

 The tragedy has stunned other residents of Queens Mansion, too. He grew up in front of our eyes... He was very helpful and friendly. We cannot accept that he is no more. We are all shocked, said A.K. Tiwary, an elderly resident of the building.

 Shocked were the bystanders, too. Imran, who runs a roadside bookstall, froze on seeing two men fly across the road from outside McDonalds.

 I couldnt move but suddenly there were screams and shouts all around. I recognised one of them as Aftab, a resident of Queens Mansion. His head was split open and he was soaked in blood. We lifted him into a taxi. I heard a constable asking the driver to head for SSKM Hospital, recalled Imran, yet to get over the horror.

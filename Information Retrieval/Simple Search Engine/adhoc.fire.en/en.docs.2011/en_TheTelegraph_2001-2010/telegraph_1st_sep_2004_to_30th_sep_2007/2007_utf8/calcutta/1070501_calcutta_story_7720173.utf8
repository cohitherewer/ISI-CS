 Traffic movement in and around the city was jeopardised for more than an hour on Monday, in the wake of demonstrations by activists of the Trinamul Congress. The party was protesting the ongoing clashes in Nandigram since Sunday.

 The hour-long demonstration began at 11 am. A series of roadblocks were put up by the activists, who squatted on roads, at 17 important intersections.

 The roadblocks caused a bumper-to-bumper traffic snarl during peak hour. 

 And traffic movement was crippled in both the northern and southern fringes of the city, too, because of the rasta roko programmes, simultaneously carried out by the Trinamul supporters.

 Said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters): No arrests have been made. The police dispersed the demonstrators minutes after they started obstructing the streets. 

 The situation, however, worsened when the demonstrators started running from one spot to another to block busy roads. 

 There was no vehicular movement between Dhakuria Bridge and Gol Park as a group of 200 Trinamul supporters, led by Saugata Roy, put up a roadblock on the southern slope of the bridge, in front of Dakshinapan. Another group squatted at the Gol Park crossing, blocking all the roads towards the intersection.

 A series of roadblocks were put up at other important junctures, including the Hazra crossing, Rashbehari Avenue, Gariahat, Moulali, and the Shyambazar five-point crossing. The stretch of Diamond Harbour Road from Thakurpukur to Taratala was choked, causing a heavy traffic snarl.

 We were prepared and deployed an adequate number of police personnel to tackle the situation. As a result, the traffic snarls did not last long. Policemen swung into action immediately after the roadblocks were withdrawn. It took only 10 minutes to restore normalcy on the roads said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic department).

 At the receiving end were the commuters and schoolchildren trapped in buses and other vehicles. They had little option but to sweat in the scorching heat.

 Celebration of womanhood

 The new millennium has witnessed a significant shift in societys thoughts about womens equality and emancipation. With more women in the boardroom, greater equality in legislative rights and an increased critical mass of womens visibility as impressive role models in every aspect of life, one could assume that modern women have gained true equality. Though there is a long way to go before this actually becomes true, International Womens Day is observed on March 8 annually throughout the world to inspire women and celebrate their achievements. Shakti Journey Beyond Platitude, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by eminent women artists from all over the country, has been organised as part of this years celebrations. Featuring works by Anita Roy Choudhury, Dipali Bhattacharya, Bratati Mukherjee, Uma Roy Chowdhury, Tandra Chandra, Manju Shaw (a painting by her appears right), Anjali Sengupta, Kabita Nayar and others.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by eminent Indian women artists When: Till March 23 Where: Artists Circle, 46 Circus Avenue

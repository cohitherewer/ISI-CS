The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Services jobs fail to spur students

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Anindita Mitra, Juhi Mukherjee, Moumita Basu, Poulomi Gupta, Bidisha Mitra. 

 At first glance, the names on this years list of successful candidates in the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examination would give Calcuttans something to crow about. 

 But on closer scrutiny, these women dont have much to do with Calcutta.

 Anindita, ranked eighth and a topper among the women, is a Bilaspur resident, while Juhi is from Chandigarh. Moumita is a Rajasthan resident and Poulomi left Calcutta years ago. 

 The performance by the state in the UPSC examination is appalling and it is sadder if we compare it with the past, rued a senior IAS officer. 

 The numbers tell the story. In 1971, of the six people selected for the West Bengal cadre, five were residents of West Bengal. A decade later, only one out of six was a Bengal resident. 

 The situation has worsened, added the bureaucrat, pointing to the list of 474 successful candidates, who took the UPSC in 2006. 

 From lack of interest among students for sarkari chakri (government jobs) to poor facilities in the city to prepare for the UPSC the performance can be linked to a number of reasons. 

 Presidency College has a training centre since 1995. But in the past 12 years, it has produced only 12 successful candidates. Each batch has about 70 students. At least half of them drop out and dont take the examination, said Amol Kumar Mukherjee, director of the training centre, hinting at a lack of interest among students. 

 The Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM) used to run a training programme, but it was discontinued in 2005, as the count of students dwindled. 

 My plan is to take up a job right now, work for two years and then sit for the entrance test for the Indian institutes of management. Civil services have never been on my agenda, said Sayan Sarkar, a B.Tech from IIT Kharagpur, representing the popular view. 

 But for others, the Indian Administrative or Foreign or Police services are still very attractive. 

 Those who are really interested in these services leave Calcutta and shift to cities like Delhi, where the training facilities are much better, said a senior manager with a private bank, who switched to the corporate sector after three failed attempts at cracking the UPSC. 

 We do have qualified people here. But those at the centres in Delhi are conversant with the UPSC examination pattern and that makes the difference, said a young IAS officer, who studied in a Delhi training centre.

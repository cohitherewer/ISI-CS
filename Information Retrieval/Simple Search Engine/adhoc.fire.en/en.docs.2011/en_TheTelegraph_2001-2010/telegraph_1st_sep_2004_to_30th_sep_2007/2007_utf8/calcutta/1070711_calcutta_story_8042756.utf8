 Six home boys go missing

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Six boys between eight and 10 years of age have gone missing from a home for destitute children on Pottery Road, in Entally. 

 The boys had sneaked out of the home, run by an NGO, on Friday and police are in the dark about their whereabouts since then. Officers fear the children might have been sold to a racket.

 We have kicked off a probe after a missing diary was lodged with Entally police station. We dont have much information about the boys but we should be able to trace them, said detective chief Ajoy Kumar.

 We are yet to make out why the boys ran away and whether there was any provocation. We have learnt that the children scaled the iron railing around the home and escaped, said Pradip Dam, the officer-in-charge of Entally police station.

 According to the investigators, the boys were tired of staying confined within the home and might have run away to local goons, impressed by their money and power.

 The sleuths have questioned officials of the home and local residents. The police are trying to find out if the boys were seen in and around Sealdah station.

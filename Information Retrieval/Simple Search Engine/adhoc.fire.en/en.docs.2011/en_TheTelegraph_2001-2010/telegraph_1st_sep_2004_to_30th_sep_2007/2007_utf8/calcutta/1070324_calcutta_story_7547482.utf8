 Screen call for green cause

 - Film focus on farmers and schoolchildren

 KUSHALI NAG

 The alarming reduction in the states green cover has prompted the forest departments wildlife wing to make a documentary on the necessity to preserve the ecosystem. The film is aimed at raising awareness among farmers and schoolchildren. 

 The 25-minute documentary, titled Lets Go For It, will dwell on the importance of bio-diversity and the necessity to preserve it. 

 We want to motivate farmers and children to preserve nature. The population has gone up, trees have been felled, waterbodies filled and animals killed, disturbing the ecological balance, said deputy chief warden (wildlife) V.K. Yadav.

 The documentary will highlight the importance of the wetlands and the marine ecosystem, the beneficial role of birds, insects and animals and the role of wildlife in decomposing waste. 

 Made on a budget of less than Rs 2 lakh, Lets Go For It will have voice-overs in English and Bengali. The Bengali version is for farmers. We will distribute the CDs in government schools and forest divisional offices, from where they will be passed on to the panchayats, added Yadav.

 Subhrajit Mitra, a scriptwriter-director for National Geographic and Discovery Channel, has shot the forest department film at Nature Park and Narendrapur bird sanctuary. Footage for the documentary, produced by RVC productions, will be sourced from National Geographic and Discovery.

 The budget being low, we havent been able to shoot some natural scenes needed for the film. We have included a five-minute interactive session on bio-diversity with two children. This would interest the school students, said Mitra.

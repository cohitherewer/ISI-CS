The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 When roads were rivers, streets were seas...

 HIGH-TIDE RIDE: The rains have come at such a wrong time. Were having our Part II exams and Amherst Street is flooded, said one of the students of Shri Shikshayatan, precariously perched on one of the cycle vans. These girls paid Rs 50 each to the cycle van-puller to take them to City College (North). Picture by Amit Datta 

 The cause: 105.5 mm of rain in 180 minutes in the morning. 

 The effect: Most of Calcutta under water till late in the afternoon. Metro waded to eight of the most waterlogged parts of the city on Wednesday...

 GPO (9am)

 The stretch in front of the GPO was under knee-deep water as office-goers far fewer than any given Wednesday struggled to make their way to work. The ongoing repair work on the pavement and a fallen tree made it a mess. BBD Bag has been badly hit. The knee-deep water is making it tough for cars and pedestrians, said a sergeant on duty. 

 Park Street (10am)

 The food-and-fun street resembled a river for the first half of the day. The cars swam and the food stops were flooded. McDonalds declared a rainy day and downed shutters, while MusicWorld could not open before 1.30pm.

 Ultadanga (11am)

 The traffic at Ultadanga was thrown completely out of gear as the knee-deep water refused to recede. The ripples were felt from VIP Road to Salt Lake and all the way down the EM Bypass. We even had to allow vehicles to go up the down stretch to ease congestion, said a sergeant.

 Chittaranjan Avenue, up to Girish Park (noon)

 The entire stretch was under water and vehicles were just not moving. All the arterial roads leading to and from Chittaranjan Avenue were also under water.

 It took me close to an hour to come from Girish Park to Medical College and Hospital (normally a 10-minute drive), grumbled Rajesh Jhajharia, behind the wheel of his car.

 Mahesh Agarwal blamed the civic authorities: We were told last year by the civic engineers that the stretch opposite Mahajati Sadan would not be waterlogged. But look what has happened on Day One of the monsoon. We could not open our shops because they were all flooded.

 Amherst Street (12.30pm)

 If Park Street was a river, Amherst Street was more like a sea. Waist-deep water made the cycle van the only means of transport. Students of Shri Shikshayatan College, desperate to get to City College (North) for their Part II exams, did not mind paying Rs 50 each for a place on the submerged van rickshaw.

 Most shops and establishments were shut. An hours downpour has exposed the inefficiency of the civic authorities even before the monsoon has set in properly, said Joy Sengupta, a resident.

 College Street (12.45pm)

 It was no better for students arriving at Presidency College for admission tests. Only we know how we managed to come here from Baruipur. The train services were hit and there was no public transport available. When we got here, we were told that the exam had been postponed from 9am to 11am. There was no electricity and no drinking water on the campus, alleged Chaitali Banerjee, whose daughter was appearing for the test. All the bookstalls and shops were shut. College Street was a no-entry zone.

 Elgin Road (1.30pm)

 The mall-and-multiplex street of south Calcutta was practically out of bounds till 2pm. Till then, the knee-deep water made it a road to avoid for cars and shoppers alike. Rickshaws were the only wheels that turned. Forum was almost deserted till 2pm, said an official at the Elgin Road mall.

 Topsia Road (2.30pm)

 Residents say the waterlogging begins as soon as clouds gather. So, it was no surprise that Topsia Road drowned on Wednesday. Said resident Mohd. Atif: Not only is the area flooded, it is flooded with such filthy water that it makes living here a serious health hazard. But the civic authorities could not be bothered. They should come here and see how we live.

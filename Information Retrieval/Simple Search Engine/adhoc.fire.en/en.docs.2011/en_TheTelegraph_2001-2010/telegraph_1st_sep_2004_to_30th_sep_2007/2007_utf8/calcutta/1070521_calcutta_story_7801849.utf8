 Busy road turns fee parking lot

 A busy road in the port area has been turned into an illegal parking lot by a section of policemen and local criminals.

 Vehicles are allowed to be parked right in the middle of Karl Marx Sarani, between Five Star and Fancy markets and Babubazar, for a fee as high as Rs 100 for a couple of hours.

 The rate is not fixed, though, as the criminals, with the backing of some cops allegedly from Watgunge police station, extort as much as they can from vehicle-owners, complained a local resident.

 Needless to add, the police turn a blind eye to the problems we face because of illegal parking, including traffic snarls throughout the day, the resident added.

 Metro visited the spot on Saturday afternoon and saw a number of cars parked in the middle of the road. Buses and trams plied on both sides. Four constables and a group of local criminals were busy collecting parking fees from people who had come with their families to visit the markets.

 The goons were carrying a diary each, in which they were jotting down the registration numbers of the vehicles being parked there. For any problem or confusion, they were consulting the constables, who were issuing instructions.

 Its so strange. They asked us to park our vehicle in the middle of the road. On our return from Fancy Market, two youths demanded Rs 100 from me. When I objected, they abused me in front of my wife. I had no option but to shell out the money, said Manohar Jain, a resident of Alipore. Its nothing but extortion and the police are party to it.

 A local resident said the criminals and policemen had turned the road into a parking lot after it was widened, following concretisation of tram tracks. Now, these criminals have become the custodians of the place.

 A shopkeeper alleged: Accidents occur regularly in the area but policemen are more interested in pocketing money than ensuring the safety of the people. We have shot off letters to deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim, but no action has yet been taken.

 Shamim was unavailable for comment.

 There is no fixed parking rate and the criminals extort as much as they can. They misbehave with people who visit the markets with their families. Those who challenge the goons are humiliated and abused. A major chunk of the money collected from vehicle-owners goes to the police station, the shopkeeper added.

 Another resident recalled that the road chaos resulting from illegal parking had led to a mishap a couple of months ago. A middle-aged man died after the taxi he was travelling in was hit by a truck.

 The accident triggered violence, as hundreds of people blocked the road and even set a CSTC bus on fire in front of Five Star Market. A mob heckled deputy commissioner (port) Rajiv Mishra and damaged a motorcycle and a police kiosk.

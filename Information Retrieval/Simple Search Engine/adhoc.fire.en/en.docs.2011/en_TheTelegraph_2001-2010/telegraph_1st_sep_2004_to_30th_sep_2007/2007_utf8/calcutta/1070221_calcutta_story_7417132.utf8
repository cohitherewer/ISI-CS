 Air fares go crashing

 - Up to 75 per cent slash to beat low-cost rivals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Domestic air fares have never been cheaper, courtesy challenges from low-frill carriers.

 Indian (airline) on Tuesday announced an unprecedented slash in fares, especially in the eastern region, valid from February 17 to September 30.

 The slash is as high as 75 per cent in sectors like Calcutta-Delhi-Calcutta and Calcutta-Guwahati-Calcutta. The airlines lowest fare now is Rs 1,150, for a one-way journey from Calcutta to Aizawl. 

 The fares have been reduced to take on the low-cost carriers, which are posing a serious challenge to legacy airlines. Lets see how the market reacts to the revised rates, said Aben Lal, Indians general manager (commercial), eastern region.

 The move comes despite the airline recording a six per cent growth in passenger traffic in December 2006, compared to the same month the previous year.

 Earlier this month, Indian and Air Sahara had announced schemes to lure corporate clients from low-frill carriers. Under the scheme, Sahara is issuing multi-coupon tickets, each priced at Rs 32,400. A ticket comes with six coupons that can be used to fly to as many destinations.

 Indian, under its corporate super-saver scheme, is issuing 12-coupon tickets priced at Rs 70,000 each for the economy class and Rs 1,05,000 each for the executive class. A 20-coupon ticket for the economy class costs Rs 1,05,000 and for executive class, Rs 1.5 lakh.

 Indian has also introduced a web check-in facility, under which a passenger can download the boarding pass from the Internet and directly approach the boarding area.

 The facility will benefit corporate passengers who are in a rush. Thanks to the service, a passenger can now arrive at the airport just half-an-hour before the flight departure time, said an official. 

 Indian also has plans to fly to more international destinations, including Guangzhou (Chinas second biggest commercial destination, after Shanghai), Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, said a senior official of the airline.

 The airline has ordered 43 new aircraft of Airbus 321, 320 and 319 series to replace its Boeing fleet. One Airbus 319 aircraft had arrived late last year and another will come in June. With the increase in the number of aircraft, we will be able to fly to more destinations, said N.R. Narang, chief manager, marketing and sales.

 To Bob, with love

 Spandan, in association with Reliance Mobile and Tollygunge Club, presents a tribute to Bob Dylan, the legendary American singer, song-writer, author, musician and poet. From being compared to Shakespeare to being dismissed as a renegade; from chanting at the barricades of the Civil Rights struggles to being celebrated by the Beatles and the Rock generation artists, Dylan has been there and done that. His latest album, Modern Times, is still the number one best-seller, making him the oldest living person at 65 to top the charts. The programme traces his journey from A hard rains a-gonna fall to The times they are a-changin, with the finest singers and musicians of Calcutta performing his songs. Besides this, significant parts of the Martin Scorcese film No Direction Home a study of the ever-changing spirit of Bob Dylan will be screened.

 Event: A tribute to Bob Dylan When: Today at 7 pm Where: The Tollygunge Club

 A man in his mid-30s, on his way to buy medicines for his brother, who is hospitalised after a road mishap, was mowed down by a truck on Monday night.

 The accident that claimed the life of Mohammad Muslim occurred on Diamond Harbour Road, outside CMRI, where his younger brother Mohammad Kalim is admitted.

 Kalim was travelling in a minibus that overturned near the Hastings crossing, off Vidyasagar Setu, on Sunday, killing one and injuring 15 people. 

 Mohammad Shams, another brother, was riding pillion on Muslims scooter when it was hit by the truck. He sustained serious injuries.

 According to police, the mishap occurred around 10 pm on Monday. When Muslim dropped into the hospital, a doctor asked him to fetch some medicines immediately for Kalim. Muslim, along with Shams, left for a nearby pharmaceutical shop, said an officer of the traffic department.

 As soon as they came out of the CMRI gate, a truck hit the scooter from behind. Muslim was taken to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries a couple of hours later. 

 The truck driver tried to flee after the mishap, but was caught by bystanders. Police later arrested him and impounded the vehicle.

 In another mishap, a man in his early 40s was killed after being run over by an unidentified vehicle on the Sealdah flyover around 12.40 am on Tuesday. Policemen on patrol noticed the man, identified as Dwarika Prasad Pandit, lying in a pool of blood. He was rushed to NRS Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. 

 Police said Pandit was from Giridih.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pause on total recall

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Alok Debnath, 75, often talks about his childhood in Krishnagar and can recall what happened half-a-century ago on a good day.

 On not-so-good days, he struggles to remember what happened yesterday.

 Debnath is a victim of Alzheimers, one of the most common and incurable forms of dementia that afflicts the elderly across the world.

 Dementia is a neurological condition that impairs brain functioning and one loses the power to reason, remember and react, explained N.N. Sarangi, the president of Alzheimers and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI).

 To spread awareness about dementia and Alzheimers, ARDSI has organised a host of activities on September 21, World Alzheimers Day. 

 The members had organised a caregivers support meet at Dignity Foundation on September 18 and dementia awareness and a memory testing camp at Little Sisters of the Poor on September 19. 

 They also organised awareness campaigns on the city streets on the eve of World Alzheimers Day.

 With life expectancy on the rise, dementia might take on the proportion of an epidemic in the near future, said Nilanjana Maulik, the secretary of ARDSI.

 The World Health Organisations psychiatry division wants the disease to be recognised as a health priority, so that adequate preparations to create awareness and social health infrastructure can be made and proper policies formulated.

 In India, nearly 3.25 million people suffer from dementia. In West Bengal alone, 80,000 people over the age of 65 suffer from this ailment, said Sarangi.

 What is most disturbing is that there is a lack of awareness about the disease. Our cultural context denies its existence and attaches a stigma to the condition. There is also an assumption that dementia is part of ageing, said Maulik.

 Our team met people, spoke about the disease and distributed informative leaflets in front of the Tollygunge, Esplanade and Shyambazar Metro stations, at Bangur Institute of Neurology, Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan and at Sealdah station, said Maulik.

 A seminar on Alzheimers at Birla Academy of Art and Culture will be held on September 22.

 People with dementia are capable of experiencing joy and comfort. We aim to create awareness among the people, so those suffering from the disease can live a comfortable life, said Maulik.

 Nuances of perfection

 Yashwant Shirwadkars Benaras series is picture postcard perfect.The presentation of the ghats brims with a sense of unmistakable immediacy. Stereotyped though his choice of places may seem, Shirwadkar hardly looks at facades; he reacts to the underlying subtexts and cross-currents that are peculiar to each topography that meets his painterly eye. Each landscape becomes a collective communal celebration. Shirwadkar transforms the sights into visions inviting us into a feel of the citys character: past, present, possible. By delineating the ideas of the beautiful and the banal, we all keep our sense of splendour alive. Shirwadkar plays with given notions of beauty, interspersing them with the mundane. The intrigue he generates in us is our human response to glimpses of perfection.The works are done in oil on canvas.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Yashwant Shirwadkar When: Till September 14; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

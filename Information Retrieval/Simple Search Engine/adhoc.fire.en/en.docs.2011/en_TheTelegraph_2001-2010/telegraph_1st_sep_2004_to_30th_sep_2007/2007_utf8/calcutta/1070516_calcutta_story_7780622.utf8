The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Longer wait for results

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The wait for results of the exams conducted by the CBSE and ICSE-ISC schools will be longer than usual this time.

 Officials said the publication of results will be delayed, by up to a week, compared to previous years.

 One reason for the delay, according to officials, is the disruption triggered by the trouble in Nandigram.

 The CBSE and ICSE-ICS authorities had to postpone the exams scheduled for March 16 because of a bandh called by Trinamul Congress to protest the police firing in Nandigram.

 Though the Madhyamik exam schedule was not disrupted by the unrest, the evaluation process was affected, claimed officials.

 Sources in the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations said the ICSE and ISC results are likely to be declared any day between May 18 and May 25 this year. The results were declared on May 17 last year and on May 16 in 2005. There are about 105 ICSE-ISC schools in Calcutta.

 We are hoping to get the ICSE and ISC results within May 21, said Gillian Rosemary Hart, principal, Welland Gouldsmith School, and also member of the executive committee of the council.

 Students of CBSE are also awaiting word about how late their results will be. We cannot expect the results to be declared before May 24, said Reeta Chatterjee, principal Apeejay School. In 2006, the CBSE Class XII results had been declared on May 23.

 As for Madhyamik, the number of examinees has dropped and the number of examiners risen, making it possible to meet the month-end deadline for results. We are in the final stages of compiling results, said board president Ujjwal Basu.

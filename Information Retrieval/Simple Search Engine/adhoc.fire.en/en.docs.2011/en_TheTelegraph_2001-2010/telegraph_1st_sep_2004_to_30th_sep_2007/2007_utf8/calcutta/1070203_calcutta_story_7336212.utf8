 Physiotherapists are clamouring for a disciplinary watchdog for the profession, on the lines of the Medical Council of India. The immediate provocation for the demand, being raised by the Indian Association of Physiotherapists (IAP), was the mushrooming of physiotherapy institutes across the state many of them not recognised and the disparity in the courses run by them.

 A large number of physiotherapy institutes are not recognised by the authorities. This wont stop unless there is a regulatory council, said Ali Irani, president of the association and former physiotherapist of the Indian cricket team.

 Members of the association are in town to take part in its 45th annual conference, from February 2 to 4. The conference was inaugurated at Science City by state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra.

 There are four institutes in the city and two in the districts affiliated to the West Bengal University of Health Sciences. The duration of their courses is four-and-a-half years.

 There are a few state-run medical colleges that offer a two-year diploma course, said S.S. Rau, chairman of the conference. There should be a parity in the duration of the courses and their content.

 IAP officials had recently held a meeting with the Union health ministry. We were told the draft bill for setting up the council would be tabled in Parliament soon, said an official.

 Once the council is set up, both physiotherapists and patients will benefit, Ali said.

 The meet will have sessions on advanced treatment procedures in orthopaedics, neurology, paediatrics, sports medicine and manual therapy. 

 Treating neck, shoulder and other joint pain by laser is also on the agenda.

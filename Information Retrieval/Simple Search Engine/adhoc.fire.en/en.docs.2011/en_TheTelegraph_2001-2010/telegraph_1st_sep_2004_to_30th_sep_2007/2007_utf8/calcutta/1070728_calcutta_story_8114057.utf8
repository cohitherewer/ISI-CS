 Reliving Beatles magic

 They were four muppet-haired Liverpudlians who changed a citys history and gave rock n roll its most abiding popularity. They shared unsettled family histories, haircuts, musical angst, spiritual pursuits, creative genius and chartbusting abilities. Symbolising the dreams and desires of an entire generation of hysterical teenyboppers, they are none other than John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr they are the Beatles. Ever since their first chart-topper, they generated a kind of frenzy seldom seen before them, or since. Hit numbers like Penny Lane, Yesterday, Cant Buy Me Love or I Saw Her Standing There still capture the hearts of music-lovers worldwide, almost half a century after they first hit the charts. This evening, Hip Pocket, one of Calcuttas most popular Western bands, presents Strawberry Fields Forever, a Beatles retrospective featuring evergreen songs. Led by Nondon Bagchi, band members include Sumith Ramachandran (lead guitarist), Rishi Chanda (guitar and vocals), Samidh Mukherjee (bass and vocals) and Shom Dasgupta (keyboards). Guest performer: Ananya. Commentary: Ananda Lal and Oindrilla Dutt. Hosted by Eureka Forbes, Open Doors, Tollygunge Club, Passport and Power Club.

 Event: Beatles retrospective, presented by Hip Pocket When: Today at 7.15 pm Where: Tollygunge Club main lawn

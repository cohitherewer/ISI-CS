 After a successful premiere at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, and 10 other shows, A Slipping Glimpse will take the stage at Science City on January 18 and 19. This is a collaborative effort between the Margaret Jenkins Dance Company, USA, and Tanusree Shankars dance troupe.

 even dancers from the US and four from the city have been part of the project that began in 2003 when Margaret Jenkins came for a month-long residency at the Ananda Shankar Centre for performing Arts, Calcutta.

 A Slipping Glimpse is all about co-existing with the other, says Jenkins. How much of the other do we really know or understand? It is a comment on our times too when our governments also dont tell us everything and we get only glimpses of everything.

 Jenkins, who doesnt believe in the fusion of dance forms, has allowed the Indian and Western styles to co-inhabit and complement the space.

 Dance has been my way of interrogating an idea, investigating meaning in a non-linear environment. I let my work take its own course and try to provide alternatives to what we see around us, she adds. 

 The multi-layered presentation will be accompanied by the poetry of Michael Palmer and music by Paul Dresher. Dresher, who has learnt sitar from Vikram Banerjee, says that it will be possible to make out the flavour of Hindustani classical music even though the instruments used are all Western. 

 The presentation will highlight and merge the physical, spiritual and cultural differences of dance from the two countries.

 Dancers from the city Jaydip Guha, Debjit Burman, Varshaa Bardhan Ghosh and Sumona Roy said they enjoyed the experience and the challenge of reacting to music just on the basis of timing and cues, not beats.

 A Slipping Glimpse, brought to Calcutta by the US Consulate, American Chamber of Commerce in India and Ananda Shankar Centre for Performing Arts, will tour the US for another three months, later this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Upgrade finalised

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The modernisation of Calcutta airport will start from January 2008.

 This was conveyed to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee by civil aviation secretary Ashok Chawla on Friday evening.

 The work will be completed in 27 to 30 months. Once complete, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport will have the capacity to handle 20 million passengers, of whom 16 million will be domestic, said Chawla.

 As of now, the airport has nearly attained its 5.5-million passenger capacity. 

 The airport will be good for the next 20 years, even if there is a robust growth in air traffic, Chawla said.

 The Airports Authority of India will pump in Rs 1,500 crore for the modernisation, of which Rs 1,100 crore will be spent on making an integrated terminal complex. The rest will go towards runway expansion, aircraft housing facilities which will include a hangar and upgrade of navigation equipment, said Chawla.

 A French architect firm had submitted an interesting design for the airport and a cost estimate has been drawn up for the project. A building will come up, which will house all modern facilities, including a number of aerobridges. In fact, 80 per cent of the flights will be serviced through these bridges, said Chawla.

 The civil aviation secretary said work on the third runway has hit a stonewall because of land constraints. We are yet to know about the quantum of land available, he said.

 On the proposed upgrade of Behala Flying Club, Chawla said a private airline will start operating ATR aircraft from there by August.

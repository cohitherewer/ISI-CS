 Sculptures of the real world

 Inspired by legendary sculptor Somnath Hore to turn his attentions to the myriad forms in life and nature, Bidhu Bhusan Chowdhury portrays themes from everyday life in his works. The ongoing exhibition of his sculptures offers an insight into the way in which he was affected by his art experience in Santiniketan, which, in turn, changed his perspective of art as a whole and played a decisive role in determining his future as a sculptor. The sculptures of Chowdhury are his medium to communicate with life, people and the halcyon environment of Santiniketan. His works thus bear direct relevance to the life that we see around us. His Family series reminds us of a common sight that may be seen on the citys pavements during winter. Bull captures the force within, while the rhythms of Nartaki and the nimbleness of the Ballerina arouse our finer emotions. Kolkata on the Move is his tribute to the city of his growing-up years. The different faces of India that the artist encountered during the journey of his life have taken shape in Bharat Janani.

 Event: Sculptures by Bidhu Bhusan Chowdhury When: Till March 13; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

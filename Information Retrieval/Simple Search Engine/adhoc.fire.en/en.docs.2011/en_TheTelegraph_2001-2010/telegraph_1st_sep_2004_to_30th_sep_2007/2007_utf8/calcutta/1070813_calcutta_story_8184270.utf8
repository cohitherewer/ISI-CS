 Lying on the floor of the emergency observation ward at SSKM Hospital, 35-year-old Ashoke Dhanuka kept fretting about his year-old son Krish. 

 How will my son survive? Will I get another job? The doctors say that I need a surgery on my left leg. Will I be crippled? he asked, before losing consciousness.

 The man from Bihar is one of the four McDonalds workers who received moderate to critical injuries, according to a hospital official, in Sundays blast.

 While the other three Sanjit Biswal, 25, Subhas Mani Rai, 24, and Bijan Biswas, 23 who suffered burns are recruits of the company, Dhanuka is a contract labourer. All of them have accused the states largest government hospital of negligence in treatment.

 Around 3pm, standing outside the burns ward, where Sanjit, Subhas and Bijan are admitted with 40 to 70 per cent injuries, Ajitabh Jha, the manager of restaurant, said: We plan to shift the three to a nursing home or another hospital. We cant risk their lives.

 Subhass cousin Mingma Lepcha alleged: He was admitted about four hours ago. There are no doctors to inform us about his condition. A McDonalds official said he has suffered 70 per cent burns.

 The hospital superintendent, Ashok Ghosh, said: All those injured in the blast are being treated. If those with the patient want to take him away, what can we do?

 Dhanukas employer Ashok De would take care of him, said a McDonalds official. But the contractor did not turn up till the evening.

 Dhanukas brother Manoj alleged: The doctors did not attend to him at the emergency. He lay there unconscious for nearly an hour. He was later shifted to this ward, only after we pressured the doctors.

 I was sweeping near the entrance. Suddenly, there was a bang and everything went blank, said Dhanuka from Bed No. Extra 1 in the ward. He has been working at McDonalds since March 18 for Rs 3,200 per month.

 A doctor said he was being treated in the orthopaedic department. We are waiting for the X-ray report. His left leg probably has multiple fractures. The right one also seems to have at least one fracture. We are more worried about the injury behind his head and are consulting the neurology department, he stated.

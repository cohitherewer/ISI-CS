 Mother visits newborn

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ripa Seal finally visited her newborn on Sunday, more than a week after she snapped contact with the hospital authorities.

 Seal, however, alleged that though she was allowed to enter the neonatal intensive care unit of AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria, to see her son, the authorities did not let her take him home. 

 The hospital authorities denied her claim.

 They said on Sunday that they would hand over the baby to his parents even if they could not pay the bill. 

 The couple had paid Rs 30,000 as advance, but the final bill crossed Rs 1 lakh.

 A trust has come forward to bail out the parents. We are ready to hand him over to them even if they do not pay anything, said S.B. Purkayastha, president, AMRI.

 Ripa had given birth to a premature child on March 19. He became fit for discharge on April 21, but his parents did not take him home, citing financial constraints. Last week, after the authorities told Ripa that she could take the child home, she stopped visiting the hospital.

 About Sundays visit, Ripa said: I was waiting since 4.30pm to enter the hospital but could not, as the officials who were not allowing me to take my child home were there.

 She entered the intensive care unit at 7.30pm, after they left... They are taking care of my child well, but I cannot understand why they are behaving so rudely with me. I left the hospital after a few minutes, but will go again tomorrow and settle the matter.

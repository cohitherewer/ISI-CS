 Bail denied in club fraud case

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Gourav Mitra, who fears arrest for allegedly cheating Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) of Rs 27.5 lakh.

 Mitra is a partner of a chartered accountant firm, NC Mitra and Company, which has its office in Old Post Office Street. According to case records, RCTC had entered into an agreement with the firm, assigning it the task of negotiating a loan of Rs 15 crore from a nationalised bank. In return, the firm was to get Rs 30 lakh as syndication fee. 

 Sujit Bhattacharyya, former steward of the club, had conducted the negotiation with the firm on behalf of RCTC.

 After RCTC received the loan amount, Mitra asked club officials to pay the fee through several cheques. One cheque for Rs 2.5 lakh was to be issued in the name of NC Mitra and Company and the rest, all bearer cheques, in the names of Anandi Singh and Biswanath Bhowmik.

 When RCTC came to know that the syndication fee had not reached the firm, the clubs senior steward Anil Sinha lodged a complaint with Hastings thana against Mitra.

 A probe revealed that Singh is a bearer of the club and Bhowmik is a Class IV staff. 

 The court should not allow the bail plea, public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami submitted before the division bench of Justice A. Talukdar and Justice R. Banerjee. Bhattacharyya, his wife and daughter are co-accused.

 Mitras counsel Sekhar Bose claimed his client was not involved in the matter.

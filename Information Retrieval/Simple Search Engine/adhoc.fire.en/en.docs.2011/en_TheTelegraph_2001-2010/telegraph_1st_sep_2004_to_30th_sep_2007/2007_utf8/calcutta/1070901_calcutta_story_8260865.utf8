The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bomb, drug detector at airport

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city airport has, for the first time, procured explosive and narcotic detectors in a bid to boost security. 

 Four ion-scan detection systems (IDS) have been procured on the recommendation of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, an Airports Authority of India official said on Friday. 

 Three of these are being operated in the domestic terminal security hold and one in the international terminal security hold, he added.

 The hand-held IDS can be used to scan hand baggage and the clothes of the passengers. The gadgets detect explosive or narcotic substances while being swiped over an object, said an officer of the Central Industrial Security Force.

 The move to beef up security at the city airport follows the recent blasts in Hyderabad. Airports across the country have been put on alert.

 The domestic terminal of Calcutta airport caters to 7,000 passengers daily and the international terminal to 1,500 passengers. The figures swell to 10,000 and 2,000, respectively, during the peak season, starting October.

 Jayanta Bag: Financial mess

 Five days after the tragedy at the Andul home of a quack, police made their first breakthrough in the case with two arrests. 

 Ujjwal Biswas, 23, and Jouni Oraon, 19 arrested in connection with the mysterious death of Jayanta Bag and his nine-year-old daughter Tiyasa were produced in the court on Sunday. 

 The court awarded Ujjwal five days police custody, while Jouni has been sent to the Liluah Home for Destitute Women after a medical examination. These arrests will surely help us crack the case, said Niraj Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (Howrah). 

 A cloud of confusion has shrouded the investigation after the autopsy surgeons claim that Bag was murdered. 

 Police, however, are sticking to the original version Bag committed suicide after killing daughter Tiyasa and trying to kill wife Sutapa. She is now recuperating in Howrah District Hospital. 

 We were looking for Ujjwal as his name was mentioned in the suicide note recovered from Bags home, said an investigating officer of Jagacha police station. They are also conducting raids to nab three other men, who raided Bags residence on Tuesday night and beat him up for photographing women who had gone to him for abortions. 

 We have learnt that Ujjwal had taken Jouni to Bag for an abortion on April 3 and thats why we have rounded her up, added Singh. 

 According to police, Ujjwal had admitted that he, along with three friends Jhantu, Raju and Chandu went to Bags home to teach him a lesson. He was close to all the four men as Jhantu had taken another woman to Bag for an abortion last month. Now, we are trying to ascertain the nature of their relationship, said an investigating officer. 

 Ujjwal, an unemployed youth, has claimed that they let off Bag after thrashing him inside their club and taking away his cellphone, which Bag had allegedly used to photograph his patients. 

 Police are trying to trace the cellphone for more clues into the case and waiting for the doctors clearance to interrogate Sutapa to put together the jigsaw puzzle. 

 In the meanwhile, police have stumbled upon facts that Bag was in a financial mess. Last November, he lost his job with the Howrah factory, where he had worked as a medical officer for three years. 

 Bag had taken a loan from the Bataitala branch of Punjab National Bank for buying his Andul house. But in the past few months, he defaulted on paying up the equated monthly instalments, said an officer, adding that the financial duress may have had a role in forcing him to end his life.

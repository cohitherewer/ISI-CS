The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Waterbody twins wallow in neglect

 The residents of Golf Garden and Bikramgarh have been living amidst a stink, thanks to two once-prominent waterbodies that have been turned into garbage vats.

 Repeated pleas to no less a person than the chief minister have failed to elicit any response from the government, the residents allege.

 The three-acre Madartala Jheel, in scheme 118 of the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), is choked with water hyacinth and garbage dumped by encroachers.

 There was once a plan to convert the jheel into a swimming pool, to be named after poet Sukanta Bhattacharjee. But the scheme never took off.

 After a lot of effort, members of the Golf Garden Residents Welfare Association succeeded in persuading the authorities to embark on a clean-up operation. 

 The environment department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had agreed to take up the Rs 1.5-lakh project, that was to end before April. 

 Around 70 per cent of the cleaning drive was complete when work came to a halt because of some shanties and open latrines that could not be demolished.

 We immediately wrote to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, but his office is yet to send us a reply, said association secretary A.K. Sinha. 

 Mayoral council member (environment) Sushil Kumar Sharma said: We are looking for a site to relocate the settlers. Work can resume only after the relocation.

 The situation is, perhaps, worse in Bikramgarh, as the residents are not sure whether the authorities will at all take up a cleaning operation of the local waterbody. 

 Once spread across 65 acres, Bikramgarh Jheel has shrunk to less than 30 acres following rampant encroachment and dumping of waste.

 The jheel will soon cease to exist if corrective steps are not taken immediately. We have written to the chief minister, but there has been no response, said Bhubaneswar Pal, a local resident and vice-president of Mahalla Nagarik Committee.

 Pal said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami had visited the site and expressed interest in restoring the pond. Goswami said the government has an elaborate plan to preserve the jheel, to be executed by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and Calcutta Improvement Trust.

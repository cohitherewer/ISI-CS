 Three air passengers held for card fraud

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three men, who had arrived in the city by a Deccan Airways flight on Monday evening, were arrested on the charge of fraudulently using someone elses credit card to purchase their tickets.

 We arrested three persons whose identities are yet to be verified after receiving a complaint from Amit Kumar, owner of the credit card, said a senior officer of airport police station. We are investigating how the trio managed to use Kumars credit card to purchase the tickets.

 Police suspect the involvement of officers at Aizawl airport. Guwahati-based businessman Amit Kumar had arrived from Aizawl on Sunday for a day-long trip. He received a message on his mobile phone from his bank that two transactions had been made with his credit card to purchase Air Deccan tickets. He immediately checked with the Air Deccan authorities and lodged a complaint with the police.

 I had purchased my ticket from the Air Deccan counter at Aizawl airport using my card which I had handed to the officer, Kumar said over the telephone from Guwahati. It is possible that the officer took down the number and allowed the three accused persons to use it for a consideration, he added. Apparently, one of the three accused men had used Kumars name to purchase the ticket. The other two were identified as Lal Liawa and Van Thana,.

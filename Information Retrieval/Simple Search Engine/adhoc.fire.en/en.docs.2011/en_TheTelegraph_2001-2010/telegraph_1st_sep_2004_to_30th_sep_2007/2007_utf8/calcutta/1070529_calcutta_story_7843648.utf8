The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Baggage tamper

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The lock on an MLAs suitcase has gone missing on a flight from Delhi to Calcutta on Monday. Bharati Mutsuddi, CPM legislator from Haripal, also complained that the contents of the suitcase had been rummaged through. 

 The MLA arrived in the city around noon on an Air Deccan flight. She was carrying a red suitcase as registered luggage. I had put a special lock on it so that I could identify it easily. However, when it arrived on the conveyor belt, it was without the lock, she said.

 Mutsuddi initially thought it was a different suitcase but a closer look confirmed it was hers. I was shocked to see the lock missing, said the MLA.

 The Central Industrial Security Force personnel took her to the airport managers office. He asked me to lodge a complaint with the airline, said Mutsuddi.

 She did accordingly. In the evening, she opened the suitcase for the first time and found somebody had rummaged through the contents. I will send someone to the airport police station with my complaint tomorrow, said the MLA.

 A probe will be carried out, said an Air Deccan official in Calcutta. The airlines ground handling has been outsourced to a private agency. However, if anything is stolen, it is the responsibility of the airline, stated the official.

 The public works department (PWD) may have to drop the plan of building a flyover at the intersection of Jessore Road and VIP Road, near the airport. 

 A survey by the department has found that the elevated railway track leading to the airport station will obstruct the flyover approach. 

 There is little space between the intersection and the elevated track. It will be difficult to build a flyover, said PWD chief engineer S.K. Das.

 If the flyover plan is shelved, the PWD will have to consider building an underpass to prevent traffic snarls off the airport. To construct an underpass, we require land from the airport authority. The project will involve a huge expenditure for the PWD, added Das.

 The decision to build a flyover near the airport was taken in view of its growing importance and traffic congestion in the area. The one-km flyover is pegged to cost Rs 30 crore.

 Managing traffic near the airport has become very difficult. The people count in the surrounding areas has increased manifold. During peak hours, it takes 15 to 20 minutes to cross the intersection, said PWD ex-officio engineer-in-chief P.K. Deb.

 Officials in the department claimed that the Eastern Railway authorities did not discuss the construction of the elevated railway track with them.

 Despite the survey report, the department has not stopped work on the flyover. It is continuing with soil tests. The PWD will take a call in a couple of months.

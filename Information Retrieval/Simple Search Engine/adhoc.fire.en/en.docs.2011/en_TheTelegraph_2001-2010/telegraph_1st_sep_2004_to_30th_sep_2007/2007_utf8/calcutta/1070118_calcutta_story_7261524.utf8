 Lifestyle the link in breast cancer spurt

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Change in lifestyle has led to the doubling of the breast cancer rate in the city over the past five years, according to oncologists.

 Five years ago, 10 to 15 women per 100,000 in the Indian cities suffered from breast cancer. The figure has gone up to 25 in Calcutta. In some urban areas, the number is as high as 30.

 Breast cancer cases in the rural areas have remained constant over the period, at nine patients per 100,000.

 Lifestyle changes are the primary reasons behind the alarming rise in breast cancer cases, stated R. Badwe, chief of surgical oncology and breast cancer units at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.

 Badwe is in the city to take part in a week-long breast cancer awareness programme organised by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute. 

 Late first pregnancy is one of the causes of breast cancer, said Badwe. Longer the interval between the start of menstruation and the first full-term pregnancy, greater is the risk of developing breast cancer, he warned.

 With career gaining a precedence over marriage and motherhood, the average age of first pregnancy in the city has gone up to 27 from 21-22, claimed the surgeon. Usually, urban women do not breast feed for a year due to compulsions. This is another important factor, pointed out Badwe. 

 Obesity is also a reason behind the rise in breast cancer. Body fat produces oestrogen hormone after menopause. Excessive oestrogen production causes cancer, he explained. 

 Institute director Ashis Mukhopadhyay said 35 to 40 per cent of breast and other forms of cancer is related to lifestyle and can be prevented.

 Change in food habits is playing a role. Red meat, fast food and items containing harmful preservatives are to blame, stated Mukhopadhyay. Everyone should maintain a balanced diet, rich in vitamins, for fighting cancer.

 Shortage of zinc can cause cancer in the food pipe, while folic acid and deficiency of Vitamin B6 can lead to intestinal cancer. Risk of prostrate cancer increases due to shortage of Vitamin E.

 Indiscriminate use of hormonal drugs is also behind breast cancer. There is a growing tendency to use hormonal drugs without consulting doctors for various medical problems. This is dangerous, opined city-based surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay. Women with a family history of cancer should be cautious, as the disease has genetic bias, he warned.

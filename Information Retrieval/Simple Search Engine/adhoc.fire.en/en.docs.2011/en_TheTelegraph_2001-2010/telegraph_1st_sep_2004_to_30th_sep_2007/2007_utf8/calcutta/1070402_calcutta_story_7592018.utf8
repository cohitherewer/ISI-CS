 A meditative insight

 Watercolour is often referred to as a mystic medium since it creates light from light itself! The base of this art form is paper, that is translucent. Hence it is flat and without any dimension. The artist induces life in that void. He then illuminates this void with his deft brush strokes. This luminosity reaches its peak when the creator applies various shades and a chiaroscuro effect is weaved on the base. Tapas Kanti Mitras recent works show his natural flair for the medium. Basically a landscape artist, Mitra paints nature as he sees around him. He has a keen eye to identify and extract poetry out of nature, to open up the luminosity of the sky within the shadows of the earth. His meditative skill in creating light as a contrast to the chromatic shadows is what guides him towards that transformation. This meditative insight helps him build a mystic reality that is the essence of his works. His on-going solo exhibition showcases the landscapes of Calcutta. The paintings are simple, serene, benign and melancholic in character.

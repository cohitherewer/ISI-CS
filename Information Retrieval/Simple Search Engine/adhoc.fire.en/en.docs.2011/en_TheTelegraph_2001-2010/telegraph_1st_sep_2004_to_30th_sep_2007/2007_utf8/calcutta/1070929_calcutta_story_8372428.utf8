 University elects its new VC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Jadavpur University court on Friday unanimously elected Pradip Narayan Ghosh, a professor of physics at Calcutta University, its new vice-chancellor (VC). The present VC, Shyamal Kumar Sanyal, retires on October 15.

 Ghoshs candidature has been forwarded to the state education department, which will send it to Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, also the university chancellor, for approval.

 We will appoint Ghosh, 61, our VC as soon as we receive the chancellors approval, a senior university official said.

 This was the third consecutive time that the court, one of the two highest policy-making bodies of the university, recommended just one name for the vice-chancellors post.

 According to the rules, the court can elect a panel comprising up to three names for the post.

 Ghosh, a former dean of science at Calcutta University, was on the state-appointed panel that recommended partial autonomy for Presidency College. He said he was yet to hear from the university or the government about his new assignment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Appraisal boost for east-west link

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The proposed East-West Metro has moved a step closer to reality, with the head of the funding agency expressing confidence about the projects viability.

 Hidetoshi Irigaki, the director-general of Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), discussed the Rs 4,310-crore project with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings on Tuesday.

 This was Irigakis first meeting with the chief minister ever since the project was conceived in association with the bank.

 Before the meeting, Irigaki and transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury toured various streets of the city and also Howrah and Sealdah stations, which fall along the proposed route of the East-West Metro.

 He is very satisfied after visiting Howrah and Sealdah stations. The tour has helped him clear doubts about the financial viability of the project. He told me that the tour had helped him dispel his fears that the trains would not draw too many passengers, Chowdhury said.

 JBIC is expected to provide 45 per cent of the project cost as a soft loan. The state government will fund 30 per cent and the rest will come from the Centre.

 The project aims at connecting Howrah and Salt Lake through a tunnel under the Hooghly. The 13.77-km route will cover 12 stations, including Sealdah, Bowbazar and Writers Buildings. 

 Of the total stretch, 8 km will be underground. Three acres will be acquired at various places to construct stations. The car shed will be located at Salt Lakes Central Park.

 A fact-finding team from Japan is working on the project. In September, JBIC will send its final appraisal committee, which will decide on financing the project.

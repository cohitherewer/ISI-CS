 The fire at SSKM Hospital serves as a pointer to the condition of eateries at other government-run hospitals. Metro visited two of them and found that even the most basic rules are being flouted.

 Such eateries should have:

 Proper ventilation

 Three fire extinguishers

 Two exits

 Cooking gas cylinders away from the oven

 Government clearance

 Stop 1: RG Kar Medical College and Hospital

 The eatery on the ground floor of the Academic Building is being run illegally by former Group-D staff of the hospital. The four cooking gas cylinders are placed beside the oven. In a corner, a youth was sitting on a cylinder, smoking. Two cylinders were kept in the corridor where people gather to smoke. There was no fire extinguisher and one exit. 

 Medical superintendent K. Roy said: I will find out if the eatery is run illegally.

 Stop 2: Medical College and Hospital

 Inside the Indian Coffee House outlet, two cylinders were kept next to the oven. Three other cylinders were near a fire extinguisher on the wall that had expired five years ago. 

 We have asked the PWD for fire extinguishers, said a worker.

 - Rate revision to usher in structured property fee in Sector V

 A sweet shop and an IT company paying the same trade licence fee

 Two IT companies, occupying equal space in adjacent buildings, have different property tax outgo. 

 Soon, such anomalies in the tech towns tax structure will become a thing of the past. 

 Coinciding with the chorus from the IT and IT-enabled services companies (ITES) in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec) for better infrastructure, the government is all set to tweak the tax laws governing the states tech hub. 

 To bring about changes in terms of roads, lights and even other services, we need resources and so, we are trying to revise the rates, said S.A. Ahmed, chairman, Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA), the fledgling municipal body for Sector V. 

 At present, property tax rates are unstructured and are levied on the basis of space occupied and the rent, while all commercial outfits have to pay Rs 1,500 for a trade licence. 

 The trade licence fee for a sweet shop and that of an IT company cant be the same and there should be a structure for property tax, said Anup Motilal, executive officer of NDITA. 

 So, NDITA is planning to charge Re 1 per sq ft per month from the companies in Sector V after comparing rates charged in tech hubs across the country. 

 The fledgling civic body has also held extensive discussions with the IT companies and developers on the issue. The rates vary between 75 paise and Rs 1.5 in tech towns in Gurgaon, Hyderabad and Bangalore.

 We have already sent a proposal to the government to effect changes in the existing West Bengal Municipal Act for higher property tax and trade-licence fee realisation, said Ahmed. 

 Both IT and realty industries have welcomed the proposed changes in the tax structure, which will bring about a parity in tax rates in the tech town. Though companies are enjoying the same civic facilities, their tax liabilities are different, as the rents vary across buildings.

 If the rates are increased and the earnings help in creating better infrastructure in Sector V, we welcome the move. Better infrastructure will surely enhance Calcuttas attractiveness as an IT destination, said Pradeep Chopra, member, Credai. 

 Spread over 430 acres of land, Sector V in Salt Lake is the home to 350-plus IT, ITES, and manufacturing firms. 

 To rejig the trade licence fee structure, the civic body is collecting information from all Sector V occupants to create a database of companies and their nature of business. 

 The existing rates are not on a par with the IT hubs across the country, said Ravinder Chamaria, chairman of Infinity, which boasts around 40 lakh sq ft of space. 

 According to NDITA, in the last quarter, the tax mop-up was around Rs 1.5 crore. 

 Once the new rates come into effect, the monthly income of the civic body will be around Rs 2 crore.

 We think with the rise in income, spending on infrastructure projects will automatically go up and Sector V will benefit, said Chamaria. 

 Potholed roads, improper street lighting and poor sewerage system Sector V occupants have a slew of complaints over the civic amenities available in the tech town. 

 We think we can address these problems once the tax rate change comes into effect We will be self-sufficient and will not fall back on the state for additional funds, said Ahmed. 

 From relaying roads to developing a parking plaza, the civic body has a number of plans for Sector V. 

 Once we have the funds, we will be equipped to meet most of the demands on infrastructure, summed up Motilal.

 Percussion fusion

 A student of rhythm in the true sense of the term, prodigal percussionist Abhishek Basu (picture right) has enriched his musical horizons with training from tabla wizard Shankar Ghosh and later from mridangam maestro Vidwan S. Sekhar. Though his technical underpinnings derive from the Farrukhabad gharana, he believes in the individual beauty of every gharana of music. What distinguishes him from his contemporaries is his ability to strike the perfect balance between playing power and rhythmic sophistication. This evening, Worldwide Records, Mumbai and Bipin Agarwal, in association with Esskey Events, present the world release of Basus path-breaking audio-album, Searching For Nirvana. Also featuring Jojo and Monali Thakur, the album comprises tracks in fresh, energetic and innovative fusion rhythms. To be released by Subrata Sen, the launch will be followed by a live performance of some tracks from the album by Basu and his world music project team, Impromptu Symphonic Mind. Basu himself will also present a few of his solo compositions. During the performance, he will explain the forms and compositions he has explored in Nirvana and the theme of his world music compositions.

 lEvent: Launch of percussionist Abhishek Basus music album, followed by a live performance lWhen: Today at 7 pm lWhere: Moksh Lounge Bar, 5th floor, 22 Camac Street

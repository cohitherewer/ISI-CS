 Love is the same old song

 The ongoing retrospective of the surrealist French filmmaker, Alain Resnais, concludes today with the screening of On Connait La Chanson (1997). He directed this light-hearted musical as an homage to British author Dennis Potter and his Pennies from Heaven and The Singing Detective. The film follows Potters gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary French pop songs to express their private thoughts. The tale has Resnaiss unique touches to go along with his homage. It is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person, and that there is a song in everyones heart for every occasion. It tells the romantic story of six Parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness. They are the attractive sisters Odile and Camille, with the older businesswoman Odile married to the glum and laconic Claude. She once went out with a businessman, Nicolas, who left her eight years ago and now shows up in Paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family. Simon works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find Nicolas a flat. Everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for Odiles place, as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be. Hosted by the French Association. 

 Event: Retrospective of films by Alain Resnais When: Today at 6 pm Where: The French Association Library

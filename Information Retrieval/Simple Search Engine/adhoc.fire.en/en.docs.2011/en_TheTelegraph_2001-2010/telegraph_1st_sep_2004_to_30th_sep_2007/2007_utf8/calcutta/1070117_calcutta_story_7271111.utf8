 Tenancy twist to dawn raid

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A raid by three armed youths on a Ripon Street building on Tuesday morning had the house-owner and the tenant pointing fingers at each other. Both filed complaints with police, alleging that the other had masterminded the attack. 

 There have been claims and counter-claims. We have started a probe, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chattopadhyay. 

 According to Park Street police, the youths turned up at 63 Ripon Street around 4.15 am and broke into the ground floor of the two-storeyed building. A witness said he saw only one youth, but the cops are going by the claims of the complainants, who said a gang of three had conducted the raid.

 Tenant Nurul Alam, who stays on the first floor, said one of the youths was carrying a revolver. After several knocks on the door, he smashed a glass panel, inserted his hand through the gap and unlocked the door.

 The other two followed him in. They walked up to the first floor as we tried to figure out what was happening. The three hauled us out of bed, demanded the almirah key from my wife and asked why we werent vacating the house, said Alam. According to him, house-owner Z. Rehman wanted to sell the building to a promoter and had staged the attack to force the family to leave.

 After rummaging through the almirah and a chest of drawers, the gang allegedly left with a pair of bangles, Rs 4,000 in cash and some ornaments. 

 Rehman claimed that Alam had been threatening him for some time and had even asked him to vacate the house. The youths had damaged the windscreen of his car, he added.

 Police spoke of a dispute between Rehman and Alam over the house. The raid could have been motivated or a simple act of crime. We need time to ascertain the facts, said an officer of Park Street police station.

 Fine rap for filthy river

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) has to pay a fine of Rs 50,000 a day if it fails to clear within a month the waste accumulating on the banks of the Hooghly, a committee appointed by Calcutta High Court to monitor river pollution has ruled.

 The CPT is the custodian of the river in Calcutta and Howrah.

 The committee has authorised the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to collect the fine. 

 The amount will be spent on the beautification of the river and the ongoing Nirmal Ganga project.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Howrah Municipal Corporation have informed us that the CPT was not allowing them to remove waste from the banks, said Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the environment department and member-secretary of the committee.

 Senior officials of the department met representatives of the civic bodies at Writers Building on Thursday to discuss the situation. 

 The CPT did not send a representative to the meeting, even though it had been asked to by the department.

 Port authorities could not be contacted for comment.

 Hukumchand Jute Mill in Naihati, which has dumped waste along the riverbanks, will be fined, said Mukherjee.

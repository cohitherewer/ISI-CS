The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Consortium bags acres

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Coming up more shop space and luxury lairs, premium premises and IT towers

 Another milestone was sunk in the citys burgeoning real estate roadmap, with the consortium of South City Projects and Merlin Group clinching a 4.4-acre twin land parcel next to Ruby General Hospital and on the Kasba Connector in a CMDA bid.

 South City-Merlin quoted the highest price (Rs 24.80 crore per acre) for the composite bid opened on Tuesday, edging out eight competitors shortlisted after technical scrutiny, from 18 valid applications.

 We will do a Rs 100-crore high-end residential project on the 2.4-acre plot next to Neelachal Cooperative Housing Complex on the Rashbehari Connector. On the two-acre split parcel next to Ruby, we have proposed a combination of commercial space and a speciality mall, Sushil Mohta, Merlin MD and a director on the South City board, told Metro.

 The condominium housing project will have 150-170 apartments with a built area of over 250,000 sq ft. The two separate plots adding up to two acres on the Bypass will house corporate offices and Homeland II, a sequel to the focused home-solutions mall on Chowringhee.

 This was the need of the hour, since we foresee the Ruby Connector zone becoming another CBD of New Town. We are extremely happy with the response from our private partners, said CMDA CEO P.R. Baviskar.

 PS Group came second with a quotation of Rs 24.51 crore per acre, while other city developers like Ambuja Realty, United Credit Belani and Sanjeevani Group were also in the fray.

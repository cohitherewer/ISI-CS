 Axe over milk booths

The state animal resources development (ARD) department has decided to close down unviable milk booths in the city. 

 Mounting losses in running the booths is the trigger behind the shutdown proposal. 

 We will monitor them for two months and shut down the booths whose average daily sales volume is less than 50 litres, said milk commissioner Sundar Majumdar.

 There are around 500 milk booths in and around Calcutta, which sell Haringhata Dairy and Mother Dairy products.

 According to the plan, the closed booths will be handed over to private agencies. 

 Already, six milk booths one in Salt Lake, three in south Calcutta and two in central Calcutta have been shut down and handed over to the agencies.

 The objective is to boost sale of milk and also to lessen the burden on the state exchequer, added Majumdar.

 Though officials do not agree, a part of the loss can be attributed to alleged poor siting policy of the ARD department, which set up booths without assessing demand in the nearby areas. 

 But according to Majumdar, milk sale from booths has declined due to the milk agencies, which deliver milk at consumers doorsteps. 

 Handing over of the booths will increase milk sale because the agents will have to sell more to earn more commissions, explained Majumdar. 

 Booth workers, employed on a casual basis, have already been sent letters and asked to form agencies. 

 We will, however, retain some booths and give them a facelift, said Majumdar.

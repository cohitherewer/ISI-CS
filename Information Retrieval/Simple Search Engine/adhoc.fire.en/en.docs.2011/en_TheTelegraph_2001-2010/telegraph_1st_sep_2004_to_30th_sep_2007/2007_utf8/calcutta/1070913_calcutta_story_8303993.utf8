 B-school brains in joint venture

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They might be in competition over the top jobs in finance, but the students of the top three B-schools in the country have put their heads together to publish a magazine on the subject.

 The finance clubs of the Indian Institutes of Management at Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta are bringing out a pan-IIM magazine called Money Manager, with articles from B-schools across the country.

 A lack of avenues for students to publish their original ideas and research work has prompted the launch of the publication. Each of the IIMs has a magazine on finance but we wanted one with wider participation and audience. This was how the idea was developed, said Nivedita Joshi, the IIM Calcutta representative working on the magazine.

 It will focus on issues related to corporate finance, private equity, behavioural finance and quantitative finance and is being sponsored by global investment bank Merrill Lynch.

 Each issue of the magazine will carry 12 articles, to be selected by five professors, who will make up the editorial team. The top three articles will win cash prizes sponsored by Merrill Lynch.

 The IIM Ahmedabad representative of the magazine, Ashish Kumar, expects participation from B-schools across the country. We are exploring the possibility of industry participation in the form of guest articles as well, said Kumar.

 Money Manager will be useful for preparing for the placement season, feels the editorial team, especially at a time when the big financial services firms like Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brother, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch are heading for the three campuses for recruitment.

 The articles will be useful for the students to keep themselves up to date, said Vijay Menon, a second-year student of IIM Calcutta.

 All the three IIMs will take turns in publishing the magazine, which will come out thrice a year. It will also be available on the Internet.

 We also look forward to involving the other IIMs as and when possible, said Puneet Jain, the president of the finance club of IIM Calcutta.

 The first issue of the magazine will be coming out this month and will be published by IIM Ahmedabad.

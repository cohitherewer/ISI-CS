 Building ties with Vietnam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya is leaving for Vietnam on Friday to forge closer cultural and economic ties with two cities, Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.

 He will lead a 26-member delegation of Bengal Initiative. Chairman of the Initiative S.B. Ganguly, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of Exide Industries, will be part of the team.

 While Bhattacharyya is keen on meeting the mayors of the two cities, representatives of Bengal Initiative will interact with business leaders, local ministers and representatives of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce.

 The seven-day visit starts from April 7, Bhattacharyya said on Thursday. I have always nursed a high regard for the people of Vietnam for their indomitable spirit and valour. It is a great opportunity for me to be among those brave souls.

 Pointing to the recent surge in Vietnams economy, he said the goodwill mission will explore business opportunities between the two countries.

 We are aware that Vietnam is now one of the developing economies in Southeast Asia, said Bengal Initiative chairman Ganguly.

 Ho Chi Minh City is fast emerging as the latest investment destination for the industrialists from across the world, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Contract killer held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Manoj Singh, a contract killer and extortionist better known as Manojia, was arrested near Girish Park on Thursday night. A firearm was found on him.

 According to police, Manoj had assembled with five accomplices at Sarada Park to commit a dacoity. The associates fled. 

 Manoj used to work with Manjot Singh Mange. Both were arrested by Uttar Pradesh police after a shootout on Park Street in 1999.

 Later that year, both escaped from SSKM Hospital on their way to court. 

 The duo was arrested by Gujarat police for running an extortion racket in Ahmedabad. But they escaped from Bhuj jail during the earthquake on January 26, 2002.

 Manoj came back to the city and started extorting money from businessmen. We arrested him in central Calcutta in 2002, said an officer of the detective department.

 He managed to get bail in Gujarat last year and returned to central Calcutta, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department). 

 Manoj was produced in the chief metropolitan magistrates court on Friday and remanded in police custody.

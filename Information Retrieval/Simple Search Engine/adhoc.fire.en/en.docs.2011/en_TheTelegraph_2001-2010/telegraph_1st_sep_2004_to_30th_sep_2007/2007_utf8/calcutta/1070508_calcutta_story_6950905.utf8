The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Going, going... days of the dhoti 

 - Watchers with Raj relic round their waist soon to be things of the past

 PRONAB MONDAL

 India chucked this piece of white cloth in some forgotten past, much of Bharat is following suit. But Bharat Singh still finds setting sail behind scooting scoundrels most comfortable.

 Dhoti-kurta used to be the standard dress of watchers when I joined the force in 1965. Since then, it has become my uniform, smiles the stony-faced man, tossing a dash of khaini into the space between his lower lip and teeth, as his alert eyes scan the faces of people entering the police headquarters in Lalbazar. 

 In another couple of years, the watcher in his dhoti will be an extinct species. Bharat, 59, is less than a year away from retirement. All of Calcutta Police have only 17 others like Bharat, who still bear around their waist this British-era relic but will bow out by 2009.

 The description watcher dates to pre-Independence days when the British employed these plainclothes policemen recruited from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to keep their eyes on the Bangali freedom fighter. It was extension, presumably, of their divide-and-rule policy.

 Like many British-period pieces, the watcher and his dhoti stayed on in the police force, with a different job. He was to be found in every police station in the city, sniffing for information on petty criminals. At one point, there were over 1,000 watchers, almost all from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

 When Bharat joined the force in 1965, it was still so hung over from the whisky-laden breath of the sahib that the young man from a Gorakhpur village got frightened. 

 If the smell has now changed to IMFL, so has many other things. The salary, for example. In 40 years, Bharats pay has grown nearly 200 times from Rs 60 to Rs 11,000 a month. If it werent for his dhoti, Bharat could even count himself as one among Indians. 

 Once the walky-talky scared him. Now the flashy new cellphone sits easy in his palm. Few have seen from such close quarters the changes wrought on the Calcutta of the streets. In the stormy seventies, Bharat dogged the heels of student leaders. In the food-scarce eighties, he snooped on blackmarketers. 

 Is sahar ka gali-gali pehchante hain, sir (I know all the nooks and crannies of this city), says Bharat, towering at over six feet.

 Their physique may be the other reason the British and their desi successors picked them. Traditionally, north Indians like Bharat have filled the lower rungs of the force, while the Bengali has replaced the white man in the chair. But that, too, is changing, with the Bharats being reduced to a minority as Bengalis take street-level positions.

 They dont wear the dhoti. The dress code for watchers was a product of the times when the post was invented. Those were days when a plainclothes policeman would look plain in a dhoti and kurta. Now, they stand out like a ship with its sail hoisted in city traffic.

 A deputy commissioner of the north division once banned the dhoti, making trousers mandatory. It did not work. It was easy for a dhoti-clad man to strike a rapport with the people. Besides, most of us in dhoti have always been faster on our toes than our (differently dressed) colleagues or criminals, said Bharat.

 A senior officer admits that watchers, or specials, have been the backbone of our intelligence collection network. 

 He recalled visiting Jorasanko police station in search of information about a petty criminal. I only had the name But the watcher gave me details about four persons by the same name in that area. 

 Bharat, now posted in the detective department building, is looking at life beyond retirement, or beyond salutes. 

 Aur kya, kheti karenge (What else, will till the land), Bharat said.

 Many of his friends in the force who have retired have become farmers. They are all doing fine I will also have time to tell interesting stories.

 Like the incident an officer recounts. A young IPS officer in plain clothes had a pleasant surprise on one of his rounds when everyone started saluting him. After a few minutes, he realised the watcher in a dhoti with him was drawing all the salutes.

 Last-minute laws for love lock

 Wedding Planner Madhumita Bhattacharyya 

 A moment from Father of the Bride; (below) high heels are best avoided on wedding day 

 Exhaustion taking over every part of your body and mind, flaring tempers, last-minute disasters and not a second to rest If these are the symptoms, you are probably suffering from the Wedding Planner Syndrome.

 This is a common though little known condition affecting all those organising weddings. It affects mainly the bride and parents of the couple, though it has seldom been known to strike the groom. While this aberration has not been scientifically explained, the indications suggest that he is immune as he remains removed from the frenetic action, choosing only to involve himself in the large logistical matters. He is not involved in the shopping, wrapping, good housekeeping and hospitality woes that seem to fell everyone else in their wake. (While these generalisations may not apply to all young men, enough anecdotal information does exist to suggest that most resident Indian males either choose not to or are not allowed to participate in preparations. Good for them.)

 In fact, the groom is possibly the most irrelevant character in the entire wedding tamasha. If you dont believe us, watch Father of the Bride. The dad goes blue in the face about money as the mom and the daughter put it all together with characteristic efficiency with some hired help, and the groom Huh, who was he, again?

 Home truths

 If there is ever a time when two people on the verge of entering the as-long-as-we-both-shall-live state of being are not focussed on their relationship, the run-up to the wedding is it. Once the vivah steamroller is set in motion, there is no stopping it. It is a behemoth responsible for many an ill-conceived union. It is enough to curb the naive enthusiasm of even the most hopeless romantic who has been dying to tie the knot with someone, anyone, since she was age five and been told by all and sundry that that was her destiny.

 If the soon-to-wed-and-currently-feuding (who are you kidding?) couple is setting up house together, there is a whole new dimension of pain injected into the already stretched-beyond-limits situation. Choosing colours, buying appliances, picking out curtains, painting, furniture, fixtures The list is as exciting as it is overwhelming. Start early, or keep it all for afterwards. Biting off more than you chew at this point will spell certain disaster.

 Survival strategies

 In all the chaos, it is not surprising that some minor yet critical details of the wedding day do not receive any attention. Here are some pointers that will help avoid unnecessary stress.

 Choose shoes with care: While some defenders of objectionable stereotypes may urge you not to wear heels to preserve your grooms vertical integrity, you may be well advised to take their advice, but for far more pertinent reasons. If you are going to be assailed by 600 guests, you will be on your feet for an awfully long time. Let comfort rule over vanity.

 Prepare inane answers to inane questions: No one knows what to say to the bride and groom during the wedding and reception. You will meet relatives whose names you dont know who will delight in telling you that they saw you last when you were in nappies but still think you should recognise them. You will also be told by at least one guest that, having been thrilled to bits on hearing the good news of your nuptials, they are now eagerly awaiting the next instalment of celebrations. If Darcy was amazed at how quickly the female imagination moved from admiration to love and love to matrimony in Pride and Prejudice, in our culture that roughly translates to newspaper ad to matrimony and matrimony to childbirth in under 60 seconds.

 Reconfirm your tickets: After the months of preparation, the weeks of stress and the hours in the spotlight, you deserve that honeymoon more than any other holiday you have ever taken. Keep your bags packed, your travel essentials ready, and put as much distance as possible between yourselves and the madness that had taken over your world. It is finally time to get on with the rest of your lives, and it has come not a moment too soon.

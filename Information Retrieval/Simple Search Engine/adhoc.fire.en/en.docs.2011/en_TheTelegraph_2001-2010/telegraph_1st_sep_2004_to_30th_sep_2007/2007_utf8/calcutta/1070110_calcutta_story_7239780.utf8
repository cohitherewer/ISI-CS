 Too much to expect in todays healthcare scenario? MedicaSynergie, a leading healthcare resource organisation, aims to change the situation for the better in Calcutta and the East with its hospital-management mantra and resuscitate ailing units with its new-age marketing tools.

 The knowledge-based consulting company organised a two-day conference in the city on Challenges in managing hospitals on January 6 and 7, highlighting the challenges faced by healthcare providers in running hospitals. More than 100 healthcare professionals from Calcutta and the neighbouring cities attended the programme.

 While state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra delivered the keynote address, the faculty for the conference comprised healthcare professionals from leading hospitals across the country, who shared their insight into management of hospitals. 

 In todays competitive scenario, a successful hospital must lay stress on planning, HR, quality that translates into patient satisfaction, and of course efficient systems. For instance, the process of admission of a patient shouldnt take more than 10 to 12 minutes, but very often, we find it takes much longer, said Alok Roy, chairman and managing director of MedicaSynergie.

 On the first day of the novel city conclave, issues like managing zero-level inventory, meeting rising patient expectations, cutting costs where it does not hurt quality of services, relevance of planning for better management of hospitals and human resource initiatives were discussed.

 The second day dealt with innovative approaches to make hospital services accessible and affordable to the masses in the micro health insurance and public-private partnership sessions. Similar sessions will be held in Siliguri, Durgapur, Dibrugarh, Ranchi, Patna and Bhubaneswar.

 Roy said a patient comes in contact with the doctor for only about 5-7 per cent of the total duration of his/her hospital stay. 

 The rest of the time, the onus is on the support healthcare personnel to take good care of the patient and ensure satisfaction, which can involve admission and billing procedure, diagnostics, catering and even housekeeping resources, he stressed.

 MedicaSynergie is actively involved in designing, managing and re-engineering hospitals, establishing and running a retail chain of pharmacy outlets (Medica Pharmacy), providing consultancy services to hospitals and governments.

 The consultancy company will also offer new-age marketing tools to bail out ailing healthcare providers. This can be achieved by emotional marketing, social marketing and rationalisation of tariff structures, explained Roy.

 We can help a hospital fallen on hard times turn around by re-engineering the mindset, the mix of facilities, manpower, finances and revenue stream. If necessary, we can also pump in some money, he added.

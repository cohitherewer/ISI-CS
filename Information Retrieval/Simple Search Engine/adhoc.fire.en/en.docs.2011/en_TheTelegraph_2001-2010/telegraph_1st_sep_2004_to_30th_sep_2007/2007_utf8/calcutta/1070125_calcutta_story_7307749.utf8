 The man of their dreams: Oscar 

 Screen On 

 amp; Off

 Dreamgirls and Babel 

 may lead the Academy Awards race, but theres good news for 

 the dark horses

 Best Supporting Actress 

 Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuchi in Babel; (below) 

 Meryl Streep wins an Oscar nomination for the 14th time

 The blogospheric fan reaction 

 to this years Oscar nominations included as always 

 a flurry of what-ifs: concern for Dreamgirls lack 

 of a Best Picture nod, for the overlooking of Sacha Baron 

 Cohens acting, for the absence of Volver in the 

 Best Foreign Language Film category. Oh, the agony, the 

 nitpicking, the sighs.

 But for the winners, the winners! 

 From A-list to obscure, the day was for basking.

 There were the usual suspects 

 Meryl Streep, Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood and the 

 surprises, like Rinko Kikuchi and Adriana Barraza (both 

 nominated in the supporting actress category for Babel). 

 There was the wife-and-husband directorial team holding 

 hands when their films nominations were announced. And 

 there was Jackie Earle Haley, a man whose more recent credits 

 include titles such as Maniac Cop 3, who wept when 

 the honour sank in.

 Man, this is just a crazy, crazy, 

 crazy day, said Haley, nominated for his creepy turn as 

 Ronnie the pedophile in Little Children.

 Overall, the Academy dug international 

 themes and locales, and diversity something it has taken 

 a hit for in the past.

 As for Dreamgirls, it may 

 have earned the most nominations, but it got snubbed for 

 biggies Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay. 

 (And lets be candid: The eight nominations include three 

 in the same category, original song). The film did get nods 

 in supporting actor and actress categories, for Eddie Murphy 

 and Jennifer Hudson in roles that won them Golden Globes.

 In addition to Forest Whitaker, 

 Murphy and Hudson, Will Smith was nominated for Best Actor 

 for The Pursuit of Happyness and Djimon Hounsou for 

 his supporting role in Blood Diamond, putting five 

 black actors and actresses in top categories.

 Commenting on the overall diversity 

 in nominations, Deepa Mehta said: It just shows that its 

 an international year, isnt it? I think its wonderful, 

 because I think what the academy has done is acknowledge 

 that theres a whole world of films out there.

 The front-runners in the Best 

 Actor and Actress categories? Brit Helen Mirren as Queen 

 Elizabeth II in The Queen (also a Best Picture nominee) 

 and Whitaker as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in The Last 

 King of Scotland. Royalty, in other words, is big.

 There was also some serious Americana 

 in the form of Little Miss Sunshine, which took 

 four major nominations (including Best Picture) for an indie 

 film about a dysfunctional family en route to one of those 

 truly red-white-and-blue events: a little girls beauty 

 pageant.

 Sunshines husband-and-wife 

 directing team, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, watched 

 the announcements on TV, hands clasped together.

 Joining Little Miss Sunshine, 

 Babel and The Queen in the Best Picture category 

 are Letters From Iwo Jima, Clint Eastwoods World 

 War II film told from the Japanese perspective, and The 

 Departed, Martin Scorseses thriller the most mainstream 

 of the big picks and the one with the highest domestic box 

 office, at $ 121 million.

 The directors? Theres Scorsese, 

 Eastwood, Stephen Frears (The Queen), Paul Greengrass 

 (United 93) and Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu (Babel).

 Fun bits from yesterdays announcements 

 in Beverly Hills: Meryl Streep got her 14th Oscar nomination, 

 this time for Best Actress as the witchy boss in The 

 Devil Wears Prada. Mark Wahlberg trumped Academy fave 

 Jack Nicholson for a supporting nod in the star-studded 

 cast of The Departed. And Little Miss Sunshines 

 10-year-old Breslin could tie Tatum ONeal in Paper Moon 

 for the youngest Oscar winner ever.

 Apocalypto, Mel Gibsons 

 violent Mayan film, was nominated for Best Makeup, Sound 

 Editing and Sound Mixing three categories that, for better 

 or worse, mean Gibson does not go to the microphone.

 Then there was the choice by the 

 Academys screenwriters to nominate Borat, a film 

 that was all allegedly unscripted and improvised, for Best 

 Adapted Screenplay (the film scribes are apparently very, 

 very confident of their future job security).

 Speaking of job security, studio 

 heads should perhaps consider backing anything anything, 

 even a finger-painting tutorial that involves a combination 

 of Clint Eastwood and Kate Winslet. Eastwood is a 10-time 

 nominee (this year both for producing and directing Iwo 

 Jima) and a four-time winner (Best Picture and director, 

 for both Million Dollar Baby and Unforgiven). 

 Winslet, at 31, earned her fifth nomination (Best Actress 

 for Little Children) Joining Winslet in the category 

 are Penelope Cruz for Almodovars Volver, Judi Dench 

 for Notes on a Scandal, Streep and Mirren.

 In the Best Actor category, Whitaker 

 is up against Leonardo DiCaprio for Blood Diamond, 

 Peter OToole (Venus), Ryan Gosling (Half Nelson) 

 and Smith.

 I dont think anyone is more 

 shocked than me, Gosling said yesterday, noting that Half 

 Nelson was a smaller film we didnt even expect to 

 get distribution.

 Arkin, 72, got the news that he 

 was up for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the heroin-sniffing 

 porn aficionado in Little Miss Sunshine while watching 

 the sun rise over his home in New Mexico. Barraza, who is 

 originally from Mexico, was one of several nominees who 

 admitted she didnt sleep the night before. I kept thinking 

 yes, yes, yes, and then no, no, no, like a crazy person, 

 she said.

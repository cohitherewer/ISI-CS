 Puri for a patch-up

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 In a bid to patch up a rift between warring spouses, Calcutta High Court advised a middle-aged couple to spend three days in Puri. 

 The division bench, comprising Justice A. Talukdar and Justice R.N. Banerjee, asked Rabindra Nath Ghosh, 59, to buy tickets of a Puri-bound bus and leave at the earliest with his wife, Sipra. The couple will leave on Thursday. The division passed the order following a petition by Ghosh seeking anticipatory bail. 

 Ghosh, principal of a polytechnic college, was arrested after his wife, Sipra, 55, lodged an FIR with Dankuni police station. In her complaint, Sipra alleged that her husband subjected her to physical and mental torture regularly. 

 After hearing out the couple for an hour, the judges ruled that the final verdict would be passed after it returned from Puri on Sunday. The case will come up again on Monday.

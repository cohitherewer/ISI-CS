 Body of jeweller found

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The body of a 40-year-old Behala jeweller, missing since Sunday afternoon, was found behind MR Bangur Hospital, in the Regent Park area, on Wednesday. Police suspect he was strangled to death, but are waiting for the autopsy report.

 The cause of death will be known after the post-mortem, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas). The victim, Ramen Saha, alias Hartal (in picture), lived on Rai Bahadur Road with wife Sabita and their two daughters. On Sunday afternoon, he and Sabita had walked to his shop on Diamond Harbour Road. He had asked Sabita to return, saying he would follow. That was the last time he was seen alive.

 When my husband didnt return till 9 pm, I called on his cellphone, but the call was disconnected, said Sabita.

 No one went to police till Sabita received an anonymous call on Wednesday, informing her about the body. Sabita accompanied Behala policemen and identified her husbands body. Police said there were no marks, except for a wound near the lips, that resembled a rat-bite. Sabita alleged that a gold ring was missing.

 Sleuths are probing whether Saha had any enemy or if he was into money-lending or an extra-marital relationship.

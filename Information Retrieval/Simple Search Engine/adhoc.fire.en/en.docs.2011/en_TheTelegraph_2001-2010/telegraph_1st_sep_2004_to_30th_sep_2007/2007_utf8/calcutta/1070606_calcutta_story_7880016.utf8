 Lacking head: Apropos

 the brief Risky ride, May 1, it is difficult to understand why most motorcyclists

 and scooterists, and those who ride pillion, do not want to wear helmets

 as safeguard against accidents. The problem is not restricted to the city.

 In the districts, too, an overwhelming majority of motorcyclists do not

 wear helmets. Down south in Bangalore, too, the recent introduction of a

 fine for those on two-wheelers without helmets has not gone down well with

 the residents. In April, five BSF personnel without helmets died in motorcycle

 mishaps. When men in uniform do not show better sense, why blame the public? 

 It is good that students of the West Bengal University

 of Technology (WBUT) will soon have the power to seek information on their

 answerscripts from the authorities concerned (Campus script RTI, May 1). 

 There should be detailed discussions before the students are empowered with the right. Once introduced, there should not be any hiccup in the process. The university should take precautions to avoid legal problems, too. 

 To ensure that students do not feel the need to summon answerscripts, measures need to be taken to make results free of mistakes. The evaluated answerscripts should be re-examined by a second set of examiners before the announcement of results. 

 In contrast to the positive move by WBUT, the Central Board of Secondary Education recently announced that it will burn answerscripts within three months of the publication of the board examination results. Dont they know that the Right To Information Act gives one the chance to seek information even 20 years later? 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 The reports Ray of hope at last, April 30, and Rescued woman reads newspaper, May 1, on the plight of Madhabi Das, a 40-year-old housewife who was kept locked in a dark room by her in-laws for 15 years, made for a disturbing read. The conditions she lived in are similar to those in Hitlers concentration camps. The in-laws should be punished severely for their barbaric deed. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 Madhabi Das was subjected to extreme cruelty by

 her husband Madhu, mother-in-law Amala and even her 17-year-old daughter

 for 15 years. It is her neighbours who came to her rescue. 

 In another incident, neighbours also joined hands for the wedding of the deaf-mute Pinki Halder and Sumanto Sarkar at Balia, Garia (Neighbours chip in at special wedding, April 30). It is heartening that at least humanity thrives in unrelated people though family ties come to naught. 

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park. 

 As an ex-student of Ramakrishna Mission, Narendrapur, I feel proud to know that the institution will start a fund for the poor to celebrate its golden jubilee (Fund for needy as school turns 50, May 3). Private firms should come forward to make the schools endeavour a success. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur. 

 The report Girl drugged, abducted, April 28, was shocking. A 12-year-old girl getting drugged and being found on a road confirms that hooliganism has become rampant in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal. Such incidents every other day prove that police are not in control. The chief minister needs to intervene before the situation worsens. Is the poor industrial climate the reason behind the rise in such incidents? 

 T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge. 

 Apropos the report Offers to lure fliers, May 3, it is wonderful that airlines have started coming up with exciting offers for customers from gifts for children to discount coupons at well-known outlets. The fares have also become pocket-friendly. It is clear that the companies are rolling out the offers to attract passengers and steal a march over competitors. It augurs well for the common people as they stand to benefit. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report Five in net for regal game of dice, April 27, it is shocking to know that duping people has now become a family business. After Montu Mukherjee, his son Sambhu carried on the legacy of duping people. Police have done an excellent job in this case, but what they have done is not enough. There will be many such duping gangs operating under cover. 

 Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore. 

 Apropos the report Lakh slap for bad snack, April 30, the government should ensure that confectioners do not sell items of poor quality from their outlets. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata. 

 Apropos the report Purse perk for park, May 5, it is wonderful that the Asian Development Bank has allotted Rs 5 crore to the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project for beautification of parks and waterbodies. This will definitely help in improving the look of the city. It is vital to ensure that the revamped parks and waterbodies are maintained properly. They should not run to seed and become dens of criminals. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum.

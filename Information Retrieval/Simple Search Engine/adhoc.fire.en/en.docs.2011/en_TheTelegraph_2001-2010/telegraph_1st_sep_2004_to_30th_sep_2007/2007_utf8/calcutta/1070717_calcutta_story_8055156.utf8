The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rain toll: Rs15cr

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The deluge that started early on July 3 submerged most parts of the

 city. The waterlogging, which was worsened by clogged drains, has caused

 extensive damage to the roads. A Telegraph picture 

The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will have to bear an extra financial burden of Rs 15 crore for road repairs following the havoc caused by rain. 

 The actual expenditure may go up to Rs 20 crore when waterlogged roads will emerge in some pockets of Behala like Adarasha Pally, near Trenching ground and Rabindranagar. 

 The CMCs civil engineering wing is yet to assess the damage to roads caused by the rain since these areas are still under more than ankle-deep water. Biren Roy Road in Behala is full of slush. 

 The rain forced the civic roads department prematurely to press the two hot-mix plants at Goragachha and Palmer Bazar into full-scale operation. Hot-mix plants are generally run at minimal capacity during the monsoon but this year is an exception because of the damage caused to roads by rain, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandopadhyay.

 Mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera said: Most of the roads in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur are in a far worse condition than the citys main thoroughfares. Almost all the major arteries in the city core area have already been coated with water-resistant mastic asphalt so that they successfully withstand water logging. Damage assessment is still on. 

 Road repairs will start from next week in full swing. Deputy chief engineer Soumitra Bhattacharya said waterlogged roads cannot be repaired immediately. Three or four sunny days are required before a fresh bituminous top-coat can be applied. The sun allows the road surface to dry completely. Otherwise, the hot-mix material comes off.

 According to civic enginners, of about 2,000 km of roads in the city, the damaged sections may add up to over 400 km. The worst affected areas included Basundhara Park, Sonali Park, Kshudiram Pally, Thakurpukur, Silpara, Bachharpara, Barisha (West) in Behala, Chowbhaga and Topsia in East Calcutta.

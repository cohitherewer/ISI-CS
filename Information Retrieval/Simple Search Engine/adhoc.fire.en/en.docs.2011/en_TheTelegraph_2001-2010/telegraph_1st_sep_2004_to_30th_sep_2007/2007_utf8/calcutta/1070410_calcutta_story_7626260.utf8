 As the mystery over the death of Jayanta Bag deepened, another man was arrested in its wake. Police also questioned the veracity of the post-mortem report which claimed that Bag was murdered. 

 Police picked up Raju Roy on Monday afternoon from a relatives place in Dankuni 

 He has confessed to have assaulted Bag along with his friends, said Niraj Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (Howrah).

 After interrogating Raju and Ujjwal, who was rounded up on Sunday night along with Jouni Oraon, police have learnt that around eight persons initially, police were looking for a gang of four were involved in Tuesday nights assault on Bag. 

 Police have also interrogated Chaitali, known to be the girlfriend of Jhantu, who had been to Bags house on March 28 for an abortion. 

 We did not arrest her as she was not involved in the assault, said Singh. 

 The youths assaulted Bag, first at his residence and then inside a club, for taking pictures of their girlfriends, who had gone to him for abortion. 

 According to police, failing to bear the humiliation, Bag took his life after trying to kill his wife Sutapa and killing their nine-year-old daughter Tiyasa. Sutapa is recuperating in Howrah District Hospital. 

 An autopsy surgeon, who conducted the post-mortem on Bags body, has, however, claimed that Bag was murdered. 

 But police have sought a review of the report, while questioning its conclusions. 

 A detailed scrutiny has to be made before arriving at any conclusion We had officially written to the autopsy surgeon to preserve the viscera, but he didnt. He has to explain his action, said Singh. 

 Though police are not completely ruling out the report, the investigating officers are attaching more importance to the first recorded statement of Sutapa. Police released her statement to the attending doctor in hospital, in which she has said: We were assaulted and abused by the four men. Out of sheer humiliation, we decided to commit suicide. The statement, according to Singh, is more important at this stage of investigation, as Sutapa is still not fit to face interrogation. 

 As the investigation has not thrown up concrete clues, police are gathering all information related to Bag and his antecedents. We have learnt that he had been running abortion clinics in Howrah villages like Manikpur, Bagnan and Phoolgachi, said an investigating officer of Jagacha police station, adding that Bag had contacts with a video and CD shop-owner at Andul bazaar.

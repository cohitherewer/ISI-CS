The cops in Calcutta are going through a rough patch. 

 Less than 12 hours after traders in Cossipore ganged up against an extortionist cop, two traffic constables and a sergeant bore the brunt of public ire near the Grey Street-Chittaranjan Avenue crossing late on Wednesday. 

 People attacked two of our constables, alleging that they had failed to stop a speeding Matador van, which had hit a man on a motorcycle near Chitpur bridge. But they were not at fault. Their job is to inform the traffic control, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic). 

 But before the Shyambazar traffic guard constables Akshay Burman and Sajal Chakraborty could do their job, a mob of 200 people pounced on them. When traffic sergeant M. Brahma reached the spot to rescue the constables, he was also beaten up and his motorcycle was damaged. 

 Finally, a team from Shyampukur police station reached the spot, rescued the trio and rushed them to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. 

 Brahma and Chakraborty were released after first-aid, but Burman, bleeding profusely from head injuries, was taken to SSKM Hospital and later shifted to CMRI hospital. 

 He has also suffered fractures in his arms. But he is recovering, said Pradeep Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). 

 According to police, a Matador van knocked a man off his motorcycle near Chitpur bridge. Rajesh Singh, a local resident, who was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and later shifted to Apollo Gleneagles, is still not out of danger, the police said. 

 The sight of Singh lying bleeding prompted two youths on a motorcycle to chase the Matador. Sensing trouble, the driver sped off. But the youths carried on with the chase and overtook the vehicle near Grey Street.

 They stopped after seeing two constables and requested them to intercept the Matador. 

 But before our men could react, the vehicle sped off. The youths accused the constables of letting the Matador get away. During the altercation, a crowd gathered. Some of the men were drunk and from the red-light area. They attacked our men, said Chatterjee, adding that the Matador is yet to be traced. 

 Police have also started a probe to identify the people behind the attack.

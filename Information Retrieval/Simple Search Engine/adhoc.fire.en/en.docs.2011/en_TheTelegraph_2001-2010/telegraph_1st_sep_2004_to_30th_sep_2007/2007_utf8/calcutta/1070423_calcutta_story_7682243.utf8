 Sourav abar shilpayon niye khub utsahi (Sourav is very enthusiastic about industrialisation). This hitherto-unknown facet of the former Team India skippers personality was revealed by none other than chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who was recalling Sourav Gangulys donation of Rs 76 lakh for the expansion of BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children.

 Once he asked me how he could be of use to the government. I said he could do something for the new ICCUs at BC Roy Hospital. Within a week, he arranged everything, Bhattacharjee said at the inauguration of an annexe of the states only referral paediatric hospital on Sunday. 

 I know several sportspersons, but no one donates funds for a noble cause like Sourav, the chief minister added.

 The cricketer, who handed over the cheque to Bhattacharjee on February 18, 2004, was happy to see how his money has been utilised. Children are the future... Im happy to have done something for them, he said at the event.

 All the equipment in the neo-natal and paediatric intensive care units in the annexe are procured with Souravs money , said Jayasree Mitra, director of medical education.

 The chief minister announced that the hospital, following a merger with BC Roy Polio Hospital, will be upgraded to an institute, with an emphasis on better research and facilities. Post-upgrade, the hospital will be known as BC Roy Institute of Paediatrics.

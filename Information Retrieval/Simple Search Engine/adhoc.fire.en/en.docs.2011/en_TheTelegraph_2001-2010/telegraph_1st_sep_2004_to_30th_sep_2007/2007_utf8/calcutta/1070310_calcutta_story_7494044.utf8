 Ecstasy of spring

 When spring comes, can ecstasy be far behind?... Celebrating the onset of spring as it arrives in the city in all its glory, The Spring Quartet presents a unique assemblage of reading, recitation, Tagore songs and dance. Featuring eminent artistes of Calcutta, it provides various poetic expressions of spring, conceived as a metaphor of life. Suchita Raychaudhuri and Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee read an excerpt from Purnendu Patreas Kathopokathan, a dialogue between two lovers caught in the enchanting web of love. The programme also brings Soumitra Chatterjee and Barun Chanda, two of Satyajit Rays favourite actors, together on stage for the first time. Danseuse Mohua Ghosh evocates the fine adornments that nature sports during the season. Bijoylakshmi Burman and Choiti Ghosal articulate poetry while Shreya Guhathakurta presents songs from Tagore.

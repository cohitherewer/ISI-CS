 Chaplin multiplex plan scrapped

 - Civic body to set up office at site

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A space crunch and the need for expansion have forced the civic body to scrap its plan to set up a mall-cum-multiplex on the plot where Chaplin cinema now stands.

 The authorities, instead, want to set up some of their own facilities at the site after pulling down the theatre, earlier known as Minerva.

 The offices of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation are awaiting a makeover and we need more space for our expansion, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 For instance, we need a protected zone to set up our central server and related gadgets, a conference hall of international standards and video-conferencing rooms. For all these, we need more space either at the civic headquarters or somewhere close to it. The Chaplin premises, next to our headquarters, will be an ideal location, he added.

 The commissioner expressed the hope that the West Bengal Film Development Corporation (WBFDC) will soon hand over the hall to the civic authorities. We have been requesting the corporation for over two years to hand over the hall to us, said joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam, who is looking after joint venture projects undertaken by the civic body.

 Our initial scheme was to construct a mall-multiplex complex in a joint venture with a private party. But it has to be scrapped as we need space for ourselves, said Islam.

 Mayoral council member (information and culture) Faiyyaz Ahmed Khan said the single-screen theatre off New Market, owned by the civic body, was leased out to the state film development corporation in 1990 against an annual rent of Rs 87,400. The lease expired in 2005.

 Bandyopadhyay said the lease terms of several civic buildings will end in a year or two and the CMC must put these premises to a more productive use, resulting in a higher revenue collection. Considering the location of Chaplin, we believe there are enough opportunities for better utilisation of the plot, said Islam.

 Officials said the cinema has been incurring losses ever since it was leased out. The business prospect of the hall is bleak. The film development corporation has been running two theatres Chaplin and Ahindra Mancha and both are incurring losses, said an civic accounts official.

 The corporation in 1993-94 had received a loan of Rs 1.03 crore from the state government. Of the amount, Rs 58.60 lakh was given to the Calcutta Improvement Trust for renovating Chaplin. Interest on the loan has crossed Rs 1 crore, he pointed out.

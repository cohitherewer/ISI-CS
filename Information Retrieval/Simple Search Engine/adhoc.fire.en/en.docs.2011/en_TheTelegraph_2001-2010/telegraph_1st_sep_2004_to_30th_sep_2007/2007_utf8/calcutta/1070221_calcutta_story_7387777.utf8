 lawless: The scene of the rampage at the police station. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 Apropos the report Maidan now no-mans land, fate rests in courts hand, January 5, the green cover in the city is vanishing, courtesy real estate agents. The government, which was earlier a silent spectator to the process, has now become an active partner of the promoters. 

 The lungs of city has long been a bone of contention between the chief minister and those who care for the environment. It is unfortunate that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had in 2006 stated that the Book Fair was being held on the Maidan for the last time, tried to hold the next edition of the event on the precious patch of green. 

 The Publishers and Booksellers Guild will naturally look to further its business interests, but why did the chief minister accede to its unjust demands? It suits the defence minister to shy away from the dispute since the Left is supporting his government. 

 At this juncture, it was the judiciary that saved the greenery, and the millions who benefit from it. Bhattacharjee is doing a fine job in attracting investment, but that does not give him the right to deny city residents a breath of fresh air. 

 Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Borehat, Burdwan. 

 Apropos the report Midnight mayhem: Cops plead and cower in the line of army fire, January 2, it is shameful that in a democratic country, armymen went on rampage at Park Street police station to free two officers arrested on the charge of misbehaving with a woman at a New Years eve party. There arent words strong enough to condemn the incident. But before the guilty armymen are punished, we should probe the reasons behind the unfortunate incident. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur. 

 It is disgraceful that a handful of rowdy armymen

 marred the New Year celebrations of thousands. The armymen misbehaved with

 a woman in a hotel and then attacked the Park Street police station causing

 chaos, panic and terror. A thorough probe must be conducted into the violence

 and the culprits should be punished stringently. The action by armymen

 portrays the force in poor light. 

 Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum. 

 While assaulting sub-inspector Bidhan Chandra

 Khatua at Park Street police station, an army jawan shouted: Do not speak in Bengali, whatever you have to say, say it in Hindi (Salute and sir save

 the day, January 2). The incident reveals his parochial attitude. During

 recruitment, the jawans should be taught to treat people from different

 communities and backgrounds with respect. 

 Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepur.

 Apropos the report Tagore ghat memorial, January 5, it is heartening to learn that the state urban development ministry has decided to transform Rabindranath Tagores memorial at Nimtala Ghat into a pilgrimage spot. Given the fact that the name Nimtala does not have a special significance, I request the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to re-christen the ghat after the Nobel laureate. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 The step taken by the management of the Dakhineswar temple to restore the compound to the clean and green state it was in during the days of Ramakrishna Paramhansa is laudable (River and rail access to temple, January 4). 

 The environs of a temple should be uplifting and people paying a visit should be able to enjoy its natural beauty as well. The tourism departments of the state and the central governments should extend their helping hand for the purpose. Devotees can chip in by not littering the temple compound. 

 We should keep in mind the fact that the Dakshineswar temple is not only a place for worship but also an important tourist spot in this part of the globe. A ferry service from Babughat to Dakshineswar will go a long way in making the temple accessible to tourists. A road trip to Dakhineswar from the city and its suburbs is not at all smooth. 

 For the convenience of tourists or devotees from out of town, long-distance trains must halt at Dakshineswar station. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 I was delighted to see Rituparna Senguptas picture at a city bookstore (Twin boons for book buffs, January 4). She is the undisputed queen of Tollywood and is making a mark in Bollywood as well. Given their looks and talent, Rituparna and Swastika Mukherjee will definitely make a mark on the history of the silver screen here. 

 Saif Siddique,

 Beckbagan. 

 Thanks to Pappy Rajjak for submitting a petition in the high court calling for installation of cameras and closed-circuit television sets in four state-run hospitals (Secret eye cry in hospitals, January 5). I feel the installation of the gadgets will benefit the patients a great deal. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Beleghata. 

 Apropos the caption No Interpreter for Mladies, January 30, I did not pay Mamata Banerjee a courtesy call. That information was false. I do not support her party or any party in Calcutta. 

 Jhumpa Lahiri.

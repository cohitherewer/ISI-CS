 Unlicensed killer zone

 - Iron rod falls from roof of three-storey house to pierce youth skull

 Munna Pandey

 The illegal constructions in Topsia-Tiljala claimed another life on Tuesday. 

 Around 11 am on Monday, Class XII student Munna Pandey was cycling to school past a three-storeyed building being constructed illegally at 50 Kustia Road, when an iron rod fell from the roof and pierced his skull.

 The teenager, who lived in the locality, was taken to National Medical College and Hospital, from where he was shifted to Peerless Hospital. He died there early on Tuesday. 

 Munna was on his way to National Higher Secondary School in Hazra. He was cycling down the narrow stretch, when an iron rod slipped from the hands of a labourer working on the roof and pierced his skull. It was a horrible sight, recounted witness Rajib Chakraborty. 

 Four months ago, a six-year-old child was seriously injured when a brick fell on him at the same construction site. We cannot raise our voice against the illegal constructions, fearing backlash from the promoters. They are hand-in- glove with police, stated Munnas father Anand, a retired constable of Calcutta Police.

 The incident occurred barely a kilometre from the illegal leather factory where 11 labourers were charred at dawn on November 22. 

 The promoter of the building, Mushtaque Ahmed, was present at the site when the rod fell on Munna. He fled the spot soon after. 

 Six families have already moved into the flats on the first and second floors of the building. Some local youths, who run an illegal power supply network by hooking, have provided electricity to the premises.

 This is how things work here. Construction in phases is the norm, said promoter Rafique Ahmed, who has erected over 10 such buildings in the area in the past two years without bothering about permissions and clearances.

 Over the past two years, over 300 illegal buildings have been constructed in the area, according to a local promoter. About Rs 25,000 is paid to police to legalise each illegal floor. Political leaders and civic officials, too, get their regular share, he added. 

 S.N Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24 Parganas), said that a case had been started against the promoter.

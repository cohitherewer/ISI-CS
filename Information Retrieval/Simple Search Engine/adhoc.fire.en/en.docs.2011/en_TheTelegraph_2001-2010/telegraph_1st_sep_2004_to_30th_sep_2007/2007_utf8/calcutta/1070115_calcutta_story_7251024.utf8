 Lifestyle toll on spine

 - Soft mattress, weight training and poor posture to blame

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 If you want to keep your spine in shape, stay off heavy weights at the gym. This is the message from doctors, who also warn of the dangers of sleeping on soft mattresses and spending long hours before the computer on poorly-designed chairs.

 The warning follows a spurt in spinal problems in the city, mainly due to changing lifestyle.

 Spinal ailments related to lifestyle changes have increased by nearly 20 per cent in the past 12 months, stated neurosurgeon L.N. Tripathy of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.

 Increased consumption of junk food leading to obesity, hours of computer use sitting on chairs with poor ergonomics, heavy weight training to build muscles are some of the causes behind the trend, he added.

 Obesity, poor posture and lifting weights beyond capacity without adequate preparation puts tremendous strain on the spine, the doctor explained. 

 Any habit that makes one obese, such as consumption of junk food, or spoils the posture, such as sitting on a chair for long periods of time, are detrimental to spinal health. So is lifting heavy weights, especially when the lifter is bending forward and picking up the weight from the floor, elaborated the surgeon. 

 Another noted neurosurgeon and medical director of National Neurosciences Centre (Calcutta), K. Sridhar also identified lifestyle changes as the contributing factor behind incidences of spinal ailment.

 The surgeon, who has a 10-year experience in spinal microsurgery, felt that the number of patients with spinal problems has gone up by about 20 per cent over the past six months.

 Lifestyle changes are the major cause behind the rapid increase in spinal ailments. Riding motorcycles and sleeping on sponge mattress put stress on the spine and can spell trouble, he opined.

 Fortunately, we now have well-equipped operating theatres, facilities for good post-operative care and access to advanced medicines. The success rate in surgery is also high at 95 per cent. For simple cases, the success rate is as high as 99 per cent, he added.

 The advances in technology have also drastically reduced the recovery time post surgery. 

 After conventional surgery, a patient needs to stay in bed for months. It is now possible for patients to lead an active life within three or four days of an operation, said surgeon Sridhar.

 Apart from the health costs, spinal problems can burn a hole in the patients pocket. A microsurgery for slipped disc at reputed private hospitals in the city costs approximately Rs 40,000 to Rs 45,000.

 Divas unleashed

 Who is the best female vocalist of all time? Impossible to answer this question. In fact, a number of women vocalists would remain timeless by sheer virtue of the fact that they revolutionised the music scenario internationally. They unleashed a magic spell on listeners and their numbers would mesmerise audience and remain chartbusters for years to come. They are the demi-goddesses in their brands of music and it is time to celebrate their music and times with a generation that is receptive to different genres of music. This commemorative programme aims to salute women power in music. The audience will be treated to a sumptuous musical feast and they will discover the very familiar young, dynamic and immensely popular radio jockey (RJ) Neel in a new avatar. A gifted singer, Neel has been singing since childhood. This evening she will be belting out all-time hits by Boney M, The Carpenters, Shania Twain, Shakira and Celine Dion. 

 Event: Rendition of vintage international hits by female vocalists When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Crossword Bookstore

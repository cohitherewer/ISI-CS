 Dead couple unclaimed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 There has been no claimant yet for the bodies of Radha Kaur and Santokh Singh, the young couple from Punjab who committed suicide on the premises of NRS Medical College and Hospital a fortnight ago.

 The couple took their lives by consuming insecticide, reportedly after their search for a better life in the city proved futile.

 Radha, 28, was found dead in a field on the NRS campus on June 19 night, while Santokh, 25, was lying by her side, frothing at the mouth. He died the next morning.

 We have contacted Punjab police several times, but they have failed to trace the relatives of the couple. Now, we have no option but to dispose of the bodies, said Pradip Chatterjee, the deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 As a last-ditch attempt, police will request Calcuttas Sikh community to help them trace the relatives. In his dying statement, Santokh had said he was from Santanpur, in Punjabs Kapurthala district. We will ask the community members to try and gather information about the family from their contacts in Kapurthala. But we cannot wait for more than a couple of days, added Chatterjee.

 Punjab police had initially told the city cops that they would need more than a week to track down the relatives, as Santanpur thana covers a large area.

 Santokh had said that he had to leave his ancestral village after marrying Radha with whom he was having an affair as he was three years junior to her. He took a job in a tyre shop in Jalandhar, but the salary was not enough for the two.

 In search of a better life, the couple boarded a Calcutta-bound train and reached the city on June 14. They checked into a guest house in central Calcutta and Santokh started looking for a job.

 The couple ran out of money before Santokh could land a job. Frustration and failure to work out a survival route forced them to commit suicide, Chatterjee said.

 Holy dip to suicide bid

 A STAFF REPORTER

The wife of a paramilitary force constable who jumped into the Hooghly with their 12-year-old son on Sunday had come to the river for a holy dip to cure her prolonged illness. Her decision to commit suicide was impulsive, according to police.

 K. Anu, 35, (Telegraph picture on right) had allegedly tied her son Rohits legs to one end of her sari before entering the water at Jagannath Ghat. The boy drowned.

 The police said there was no witness to the incident. Three men, who rescued Anu on Sunday, had said that Rohits legs were tied with her sari. 

 It seems that her decision to kill herself was impulsive. But it is difficult to understand why she jumped with her son. She is in a state of shock and cannot explain her actions. She left for her home in Durgapur with her husband this afternoon, said Partha Pratim Mukherjee, officer-in-charge of North Port police station on Monday.

 Another officer of the thana said: Anu has been suffering from gynaecological problems for the past three years and was operated on twice. A priest had suggested that she take a dip in the river to be cured of the ailments.

 She set out from her home soon after her husband K.D.S. Raju left for work on Sunday morning. After spending some time at Jagannath Ghat, Anu decided to kill herself. Acute depression prompted her to attempt suicide, added the officer. 

 The investigators did not rule out the possibility of Anu tying her sons legs before jumping into the river. But there is no witness and she didnt tell us anything despite our best efforts. Anu sat on the ghat with her son for half an hour and had tea before entering the water. Its possible that her sari got entangled with his legs, the officer added. 

 The three men, who had assembled at the ghat for a dip, saw Anu sinking and dived into the river to save her. They said she might have started to drown when the boys body began to sink.

 Raju arrived in Calcutta on Sunday evening. He told us Anu was depressed and used to confine herself to the house. He confirmed that she had gynaecological problems and the pain became unbearable at times, said another officer. 

 The investigators have found out that Anu and her son took a local train from Durgapur and reached Howrah around 10.45am. They roamed around for some time, before making their way to Jagannath Ghat around 11.30am.

 The police have found Anus handbag, which contained Rs 150, a mobile phone and a handkerchief.

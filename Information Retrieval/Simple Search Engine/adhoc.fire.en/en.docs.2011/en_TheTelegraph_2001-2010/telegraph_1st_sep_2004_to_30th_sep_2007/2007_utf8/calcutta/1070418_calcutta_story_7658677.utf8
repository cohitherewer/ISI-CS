 Spot the star: (From top) A

 country that is obsessed with overhyped sports stars like Sachin Tendulkar

 (getting out versus Sri Lanka in picture), rogue film stars like Salman

 Khan (coming out of Jodhpur prison in picture) and Sanjay Dutt and gangsters rsquo; girlfriends

 like Monica Bedi will certainly fail to recognise the honesty

 of ordinary people like Ajit Guha (False pledge for honesty, March 26).

 While the stinking rich stars are pampered by the government and private

 organisations, Guha, who struggles to make ends meet,

 is left to fend for himself and his family. No one will felicitate him

 because the cop rsquo;s presence does not guarantee publicity.

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur

 Apropos the report Two killed in mishaps, March 20, rash driving in the city is a matter of serious concern. An overwhelming majority of people who drive in Calcutta dont

 know how to. I have seen people drive like a three-year-old on a motorcycle. 

 We moved to Calcutta last year and were looking for a driver. All the candidates had licences but none of them knew how to drive properly. We decided to drive the car ourselves. 

 We have lived in five other cities and have never seen so many bad drivers on the road. Buses here are driven without the gear coming into use for kilometres. 

 I dont think the drivers alone should be blamed. Why are there no vehicle inspectors here? The government officials who issue licences without proper checks are the real culprits. 

 The government needs to take the issue seriously. Politics has made matters worse. Most bus drivers are union members and cannot be touched. The transport minister owes an explanation for this mess. 

 Suma Nair,

 Address not given. 

 Apropos the report Senior ire for dutiful cop, March 26, the rulebook does not exempt the sons of politicians from wearing helmet and carrying driving licence while riding two-wheelers. But a Congress leaders son was doing exactly that. When he was stopped by a dutiful sergeant, he called a senior cop to secure his release. One feels for the sergeant, who was unjustly humiliated. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 The harassment of a cop by a politicians son proves that police are not independent and remain in the clutches of politicians even after 60 years of Independence. Earlier, it was the British who ruled, now it is the turn of the politicians. I salute sergeant Amitabha Chakraborty for trying to make a politicians

 son abide by the rules. 

 Rakesh Bhatia, 

 Loudon Street. 

The report Foul air suit gets court revival nod, March 16, made for interesting reading. New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore have taken the lead in switch of vehicles from petrol or diesel to LPG to bring down the air pollution level. The Left Front government, however, is allowing air pollution to steadily go up in Calcutta. The citizens can only hope that the high court will ban vehicles that are more than 15 years old. 

 T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge. 

 While no one supports mauling of the Maidan (and Eden Gardens) by rallyists, the reaction of Ladies Golf Club sounds bizarre (Golfer groan over green, March 13). The club administrators response smacks of snobbery. If the Maidan cannot be spared for Book Fair or Kisan Rally, it should not spared for golf either. 

 Tapan Pal, 

 Batanagar 

 Apropos the report Tolly club post, March 24, Calcutta possibly boasts of the maximum number of clubs. Unfortunately, the club culture is no longer there. Earlier, AGMs used to be a smooth affair with the president and committee members being elected according to recommendations of the outgoing panel. Now club elections are full of intrigue and politics. Money power plays a major role. The exclusiveness of most clubs have also vanished with catering being handed over to private firms. 

 A.S. Mehta,

 New Alipore. 

 Apropos the report Phone theft at airport, March 14, it is disheartening that valuables are disappearing from the security area of the airport. The authorities must take necessary steps to spare passengers of the tension of thefts. 

 Moumita Mazumder,

 Madhyamgram. 

Apropos Stitches, blood clot for boy, March 23, it is sad that a boy suffered injuries because of a glass panel crashing down on him from a building. Contractors often neglect to take precautions and use poor quality material for profit. The contractor responsible should punished. 

 Rathin Chatterjee, 

 Dum Dum. 

 One wonders why the marine engineering college in Taratala is on the verge of losing its prominence and becoming a replica of a central university (Fear of losing eminence, March 14). The state government and ex-students of the college should protest the move. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park.

 August 2006 16 days, 42 accidents, nine of them fatal. Who is to blame for the blood on the streets? A Metro checklist.

 Motor Vehicles

 Charge: Road mishaps are rising in proportion to the number of road-unworthy drivers being issued a licence to kill by a lax motor vehicles department, in cahoots with driving schools and touts.

 Defence: We have a system in place and we test the driving skills of every applicant. We make an effort to keep a check on corrupt practices among those issuing licences, said an official of the public vehicles department.

 Unions

 Charge: Lack of punitive measures for errant bus drivers, commission on ticket sale to conductors and drivers encouraging speeding, and poor maintenance of vehicles. 

 Defence: We can do nothing about errant drivers because Citu controls the entire system. When we refuse to employ bad drivers, the union forces us to take them in. The drivers and conductors enjoy union support, says Bengal Bus Syndicate vice-president Rabindranath Saha.

 Traffic police

 Charge: Poor vigilance and lack of enforcement. No effort to slam the brakes on racing buses. No move to make buses use bus bays and halt only at designated stops. Chaos and corruption at crossroads.

 Defence: We go by the rulebook and haul up reckless drivers. But even drivers responsible for fatal accidents manage to get bail within a couple of days. Whenever a traffic cop is caught taking bribe, we take strong action against him, claims Ranvir Kumar, the joint commissioner of police (traffic).

 Government

 Charge: No effort to clean up motor vehicles department and make issuing of licence more stringent. No effort to rein in Citu. No effort to do away with commission system and check rash driving.

 Defence: Enforcement agencies like police are there to take steps against errant drivers. We are helpless, says transport department principal secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

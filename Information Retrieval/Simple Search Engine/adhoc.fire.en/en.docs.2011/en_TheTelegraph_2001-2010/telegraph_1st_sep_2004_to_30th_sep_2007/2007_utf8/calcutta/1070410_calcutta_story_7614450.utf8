 A three-acre waterbody in Golf Garden, choked with water hyacinth and garbage dumped by encroachers on the banks, will soon be restored and beautified.

 Officials in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said the Rs 1.5-lakh project will kick off on the eve of Bengali new year and will be wrapped up in a month.

 Golf Garden residents have long been demanding restoration of Madartala Jheel, in scheme No. 118 of the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), and had even petitioned chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take up the project.

 They had blamed administrative apathy for the present state of the pond. The authorities had once thought of converting it into a swimming pool, but the plan was shelved for unstated reasons.

 We are happy that the jheel will finally be restored and beautified, said secretary of the Golf Garden Residents Welfare Association A.K. Sinha. We had been demanding its renovation not just because we care for the environment, but because it is the only source of water in the event of a fire in a neighbourhood, where around 300 families live, he added.

 Outlining the civic bodys plan, mayoral council member (environment) Sushil Kumar Sharma said the pond will be cleared of water hyacinth and garbage and pillars of sal logs will be erected along the banks.

 We will also plant trees and set up benches on the banks. Besides, there is a plan to introduce pisciculture, for which local self-help groups will be engaged, added the mayoral council member.

 Some of the residents, however, fear that the jheel will again turn into a filth dump if the illegal settlers are not removed.

 Local councillor Setabuddin Khondekar, too, has admitted that unless the settlers are relocated, there is no guarantee that the pond will remain clean.

 We are looking for an alternative site to rehabilitate the settlers and are in talks with the state government, as the corporation alone cannot handle the task. Our aim is to beautify the waterbody and relocate the squatters simultaneously, he said.

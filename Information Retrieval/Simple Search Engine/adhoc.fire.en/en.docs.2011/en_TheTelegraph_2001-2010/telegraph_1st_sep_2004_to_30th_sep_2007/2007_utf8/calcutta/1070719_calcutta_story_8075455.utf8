 Church list of schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The authorities of 89 church bodies in and around the city on Wednesday submitted to the state government a list of names and addresses of over 550 schools run by them.

 The state government is planning to introduce a section on church schools in the proposed act to regulate private schools. Being minority institutions, the church schools are entitled to special privileges.

 The church representatives submitted the list to the government to ensure that schools that are not entitled to use the prefix Saint (St) are not treated on a par with the schools that are entitled to.

 The list will help the government to quickly find out if a school is eligible for privileges enjoyed by minority institutions, the school education minister, Partha De, told the delegation of church bodies after receiving the list, according to sources in the education department.

 The Association of Christian Schools had alleged last month that a section of private English-medium schools that have no link with Christian missionaries or Anglo-Indian trusts were charging high tuition and other fees for offering poor educational facilities. This, the association felt, was creating confusion and misleading parents.

 The list is authentic as it has been prepared jointly by the founder bodies of Christian missionaries and churches operating here, said Father Faustine Brank, a member of the association and the president of the education cell of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba.

 The delegation consisted of representatives from the association and Bangiya Christiya Pariseba.

 A second list of schools run by Anglo-Indians is being prepared. We will submit the second list to the government next month, said Brank. 

 De made it clear that the government will not allow any undeserving school to enjoy minority rights while participating in a discussion on school education budget in the Assembly on Monday.

 Issues related to the framing of the act and simplification of the recruitment process in state-aided Christian missionary schools were discussed in Wednesdays meeting. 

 We are happy that the government is keen on taking steps against errant schools, said Herod Mullick, the general secretary of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba.

 The government, however, will meet the organisations for a second time next month.

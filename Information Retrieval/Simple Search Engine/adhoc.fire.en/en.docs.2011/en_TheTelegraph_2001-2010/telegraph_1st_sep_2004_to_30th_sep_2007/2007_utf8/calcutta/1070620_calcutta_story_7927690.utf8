 Instant care ward

 - New eight-bed facility at hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Patients rushed to hospital in an emergency have to wait for more than half an hour for the first round of treatment, while relatives go through the admission procedure. Sometimes, valuable time is lost when there is no vacancy in the wards. 

 Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) hopes to take care of this by opening a new facility for instant medical assistance.

 There are three steps to trauma treatment: Pre-hospital care, hospital care and rehabilitation. In India, we have very poor infrastructure for pre-hospital care. Keeping that in mind, we have started our shock trauma section, said M. Chattopadhyay, medical superintendent, CMRI.

 He added: Once an emergency case arrives, treatment is administered to the patient within a couple of minutes. In medical parlance, there is something called the golden hour, which is the first hour after an accident or a mishap has taken place. If treatment is provided within the first hour, there is a high probability of the patient surviving.

 The eight-bed shock trauma section consists of a triage and a shock and trauma room equipped with ventilators and CT scan facilities. Once an emergency case arrives, the consultants at the triage will decide if the case should be transferred to the ward or treated at the shock trauma section. 

 There is a small operating theatre attached to the shock trauma section. It is not meant only for surgical cases, said Arpan Chaudhuri, shock trauma registrar and intensivist, CMRI. None of the beds has been vacant since we have opened the section. Many patients have undergone their full treatment here and left.

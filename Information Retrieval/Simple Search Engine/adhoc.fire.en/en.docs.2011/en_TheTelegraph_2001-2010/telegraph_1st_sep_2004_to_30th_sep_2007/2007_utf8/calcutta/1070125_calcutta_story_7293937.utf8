 Creativity 

 without chains

 Talking stories, thats 

 what students of Arizona State University (ASU) and the 

 English department of Jadavpur University were busy doing 

 on January 11. In India, as a part of the Kalam initiative 

 of Daywalka Foundation, Melissa Pritchard and her students 

 from the creative writing department at ASU delved into 

 the stumbling blocks of fiction writing in India and the 

 world over. The foundation has been working with underprivileged 

 children associated with city NGOs to provide them with 

 a platform to express their creativity.

 Rimi B. Chatterjee, who is the 

 coordinator of the Writing in Practice course at the Department 

 of English, JU, spoke of the sense of violation in putting 

 ones writing for judgment before a readership that 

 is quick to criticise. Pritchard referred to the scenario 

 in the US where political forces often silence stories. 

 Deemed as one of the many ways in which the creative voice 

 is being muted, students also spoke on the traditional marginalisation 

 of women writers. Bollywood came under discussion as an 

 arena where melodrama is considered a valid expression of 

 creativity.

 The financial hurdles before people 

 who take up fiction writing as career was brought to the 

 fore by Subhadeep Paul, a final-year MPhil student of JU. 

 He spoke on the difficulty of balancing the dual roles of 

 academic and writer. Rimi B. Chatterjee, a published author 

 herself, agreed, saying writers have to survive in 

 India by hiding deep under the cover of an academic.

 Responding to a students 

 comment about being unable to write after reading Emily 

 Brontes Wuthering Heights, Pritchard stressed the 

 need to find ones voice: The best way to read 

 is to unpack the writers work to find out what you 

 like about him read like a taxonomist! You cant 

 let yourself silence yourself.

 Many from the morning session 

 came together that afternoon again at Caffeine on Elgin 

 Road to read out their works.

 On January 12, Pritchards 

 crew participated in another creative writing workshop with 

 youngsters from Kalam. A magazine, Khola Baksho, put together 

 by them will be released in February with contributions 

 from underprivileged children of NGOs Sanlaap, Diksha and 

 Development Action Society. 

 During the workshop youngsters 

 Nargis and Reshma Khatun asked how identities of characters 

 from real-life incidents can be protected in narratives 

 and how best to handle sexuality in fiction. Michael Green, 

 an ASU student responded: Poets have to be courageous. 

 They are the ones meant to break the barriers of complacency. 

 If you want to talk about sexuality, go ahead and talk about 

 it.

Ground reality

 The annual strategy summit of 

 the ICFAI Business School (IBS), Calcutta, held on January 

 18 was not about finance and business management. Instead 

 issues like creativity, innovation and transformation in 

 management and social projects came under discussion.

 The institute believes that not enough innovation and creativity gets reflected in extant courses. So more exposure is needed for the students. Management schools are increasingly becoming elite institutions. So exposure to the less privileged is essential, said Santanu Ray, director, IBS, Calcutta.

 A centre set up by the business school to involve students in social activity recently ran a project in Unsani village of Howrah. The project in association with the Garment Manufacturers Association of Howrah provided accounting and marketing training to 60 tailors. The centre with support from NGO Sanlaap, got students of the business school to coach teenaged children of sex workers. They come to the campus twice a week for three months.We are now planning to provide vocational training to them, informed Ray.

Contrast reads

 This instalment of Only Connect 

 is about two books. One was printed in 1455, in a print 

 run of 180 copies, no two of which were exactly alike. The 

 other was published in 1992, in two limited editions, deluxe 

 and small. Both books were set in double columns with exactly 

 42 lines in each column. Of the 180 copies of the earlier 

 book, about 40 were printed on vellum and the rest on paper. 

 The latter book was accompanied by a floppy disk which self-erased 

 or ate itself after it was read.

 No marks for guessing the first 

 Johannes Gutenbergs two-volume Bible, the 

 first-ever book to be printed with movable type, in the 

 tiny German city of Mainz. The second book is the work of 

 William Gibson, inventor of cyberpunk, a sub-genre of modern 

 science fiction. In 1984, the year of George Orwells 

 Big Brother, Gibson wrote the extraordinary Neuromancer 

 which tells the story of Case, a computer hacker who is 

 able to jack himself into cyberspace till his irate employers 

 destroy his central nervous system with a military mycotoxin. 

 Down and out in a dystopic Tokyo of the future, Case begins 

 to trawl the world of biomedical engineering and cybernetic 

 impulses in an attempt for cure

 If Gutenberg produced perhaps 

 the most beautifully produced book of all time, how do we 

 make sense of Gibsons attempt to both celebrate and 

 destroy the book at the same time? Gibsons Agrippa 

 (A Book of the Dead) comes in a heavy case designed to look 

 like a buried relic and includes pages of DNA sequences, 

 as well as copperplate aquatint etchings by the artist Dennis 

 Ashbaugh. No two copies of this extremely limited-edition 

 (number of copies unknown) book are exactly alike.

 The accompanying diskette, on 

 the other hand, contains a poem by Gibson, on the broad 

 theme of memory. This is what the admirable Wikipedia has 

 to say of it: The poem is a detailed description 

 of several objects, including a photo album and the camera 

 that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the 

 nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels 

 towards the details of his familys history: the painstaking 

 descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they 

 drove, and even their pets. After the poem is read, 

 the text slowly erases itself from the screen, leaving the 

 reader only with a memory of what she has read.

 Those interested in this strange 

 and haunting work may visit The Agrippa Files at http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/, 

 a scholarly site maintained by the English department of 

 the University of Santa Barbara. For those who prefer their 

 reading material to be less transient, the best starting 

 point is the digital Gutenberg project at http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg/.

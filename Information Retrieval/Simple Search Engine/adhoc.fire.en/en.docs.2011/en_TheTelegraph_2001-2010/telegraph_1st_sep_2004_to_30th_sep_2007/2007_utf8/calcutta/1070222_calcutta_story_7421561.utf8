 A tribute to Bikash Bhattacharjee

 The works of Bikash Bhattacharjee present a powerful combination of realism and fantasy; a journey where reality sets the ball rolling and fantasy helps his canvas assume a new reality. His paintings also reveal his predilection for forms that consist of tones, rather than lines of varying intensity. Female beauty was another major subject of his paintings, where he portrayed a strange mixture of spirituality and sensuality. Indigenous Modernity Various Trends, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by senior artists of Bengal, is being held as a tribute to the master painter. Participants include Paritosh Sen, Dhirendra Nath Brahma, Reba Hore, B.R. Panesar, Shanu Lahiri, Kartick Chandra Pyne, Sailen Mittra, Prokash Karmakar, Sanat Kar, Dhiraj Choudhury (a painting by him appears right), Dipak Banerjee, Ganesh Haloi, Suhas Roy, Ganesh Pyne, Anita Roy Chowdhury and Jogen Chowdhury. Curator: Mrinal Ghosh.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by senior artists of Bengal When: Till February 28 Where: Aakriti Art Gallery, 1st floor, Orbit Enclave, 12/3A Hungerford Street

 It takes two to tango. And the boys from St Xaviers and the girls from Loreto House realised that long back. 

 Saturday evening saw the ex-students of the two institutions come together once again on the St Xaviers playground. The occasion was the reunion of Alumnorum Societas (Alsoc), the St Xaviers School Old Boys Association. The programme was christened En Duet 07 after alumni of the neighbouring Loreto House were invited to be a part of it. 

 En Duet is the celebration of the camaraderie and bonhomie that the students of the two schools share. And it has always been so. The last reunion was held in 1996. En Duet is back after 11 years with all its warmth, memory and mischief, said En Duet 07 convener Arijit Roychowdhury. 

 A galaxy of performers, including Usha Uthup, Francis Lepcha and Priscilla Corner, provided the entertainment for the evening.

 Every time I come for En Duet, I feel nostalgic. Those dates over ice cream, fests, going to movies I relived all the special moments. Even now, the students of the two schools share a special bond. My daughter is a student of Loreto House and has many friends from St Xaviers, said Kashish Jhawar, of the batch of 1990. 

 Flurys, on Park Street, was the favourite hangout of many students of the schools that are a stones throw away. To take them down the memory lane, a pavilion was set up at the restaurant for dinner. Friends from the two institutions could be seen catching up over the delectable fare. 

 The old boys association is involved in philanthropic projects. Besides, it regularly organises events to promote interaction and fellowship amongst members.

 We have completed the renovation and the enhancement of the senior and primary school libraries. We are also trying to replant trees around the school ground, said the convener.

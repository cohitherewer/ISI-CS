 Stay on HS reassess order

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The division bench of the high court on Monday stayed Justice B. Somadders order directing the higher secondary council to reassess an examinees answer script.

 On August 20, Justice Somadder had asked the council to appoint three expert examiners for re-assessing the answer script of Poulomi Biswas, who failed in this years higher secondary but cleared the joint entrance examination.

 Justice P.K. Roy and Justice P. Mondal passed the interim order on an appeal by the council challenging the legality of earlier order. 

 The councils advocate argued: There is no provision in the existing rules of the council to re-assess answer scripts. When a student asks for review of his or her answer script, the council only scrutinises the marks.

 The division bench has fixed the matter for hearing after four weeks.

 The interim order is significant because Justice Somadder had passed similar orders in cases involving two other examinees.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 I cant be saas or bahu

 Yet, PANKAJ KAPOOR has not deserted TV. He tells Pratim D. Gupta about being selective about roles, his forthcoming film The Blue Umbrella, son Shahid and more

 Despite the brilliant comeback in Maqbool, why do we see so little of you on the big screen?

 Its not that I am not doing films at all. At the moment I am working on as many as four films. Its just that I have been selective all my life. I cannot relate to certain things that happen in our movies. So I try to space out my work and concentrate on what I am doing. I have never been one to do 15-20 films a year. Four or five films are more like it. I have to like the subject, the persons involved with the project...

 You do like Vishal Bhardwaj

 Oh yes, I have known Vishal for a long time although the real bonding happened during the making of Maqbool. He has a brilliant mind and wants to make different kinds of stories into films. The Blue Umbrella is an extension of our association. Again, he has something to say and thats why he has made this film.

 It is being perceived as a childrens film

 Its being pitched as a childrens film but it should reach out to all strata of society. Its high time that people in our country start watching good cinema. As we have seen, huge releases with big stars havent always worked. Unless the film is well made, people havent reacted favourably. They are no longer enamoured by the stars, they come to see the film.

 Most of your scenes in The Blue Umbrella are with children. Is it difficult to shoot with kids?

 Not really. I love children and I have the knack of being normal with them. You have to treat them as equals and that will do it.

 Nandkishore Khatri is quite a contrast to Abbaji

 Yes, it is totally in contrast to what was done in Maqbool. Khatri is a small miserly shopkeeper. I do not want to pre-reveal it but I have always wanted to convey different kinds of human beings to audiences and Khatri is a step in that direction. I want to show my ability as an actor and not as a face. I want to play and live different human beings who can be looked upon and thought about differently.

 What are the other films you are doing?

 Theres Rajkumar Santoshis Halla Bol, Bhavna Talwars Dharm and a Hollywood film called Good Sharma (co-starring Joan Allen and Billy Connolly) directed by Suri Krishnamma.

 You havent deserted TV, though

 Yes, I have been doing Naya Office Office on STAR One. It came three years after Office Office had gone off air. I decided to take this up because I had a very nice time working on it the first time round. Musaddilal was always very popular and the different channel promised larger viewership. I had chosen TV over films at one point of time because monotony had set into movies and there was nothing new on offer. Today, while I am happy that there is a change in films, see whats happened to TV

 Whats happened to TV, according to you? 

 A great and powerful medium is being wasted. Look what they are showing all the time. Can you imagine what effect the saas-bahu serials are having on the middle class? You see all the jewellery and saris and you either feel deprived or jealous. You think, why cant I do it? There is more scope of corruption, a whole lot of extra-marital affairs. What are you offering to society? The youth in their formative years are growing up watching all this. Somebody has to speak up. This constant hammering in the head has to stop.

 So you are having to be selective on TV, also...

 Yes, neither can I be a saas nor a bahu. So I choose to laugh at myself in Naya Office Office. The serial talks about the problems we have around us. And it does so with a sense of humour. The audiences like it because they can feel associated with the exploitation of the common man. It had gone off the air because it had become repetitive after the three-and-a-half-year run. Now we have new things to talk about and so we are back.

 Finally, are you happy with the way your son Shahid Kapurs career has shaped up?

 He has done well. Its obvious that he has a box-office popularity. And now Vivah has done well. But I want him to be known as not just a face but also a dramatic actor. I can understand he has a nice personality and his warmth fills the screen, but the directors need to use him in dramatic and interesting roles. I believe he has a lot of potential in him and I am not saying this as a father.

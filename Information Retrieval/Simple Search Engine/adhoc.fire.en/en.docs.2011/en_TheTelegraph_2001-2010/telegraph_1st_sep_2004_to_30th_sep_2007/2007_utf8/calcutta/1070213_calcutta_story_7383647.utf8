 Unrest in Besu on upgrade delay 

 A STAFF REPORTER

In the dark about the upgrade issue, teachers of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) are readying to launch an agitation on campus.

 The 150-year-old institute is among the seven in the country shortlisted by the Union human resources development ministry for upgrade to Institute of National Importance (INI) status.

 We will go on a days mass casual leave on Tuesday to protest complete lack of communication on the matter from the central and state governments, said Bengal Engineering and Science University Teachers Association (Besuta) secretary Sujay Mukherjea.

 The teachers union is also eyeing a long-term programme to pressure the state government and the MPs concerned to take up the universitys cause.

 With only a couple of weeks to go for the budget, the institute officials are in the dark about grants to be provided to it under the Eleventh Plan. The funds allocation will indicate whether the university is going to be upgraded.

 The last communication on the upgrade was from the state higher education minister in December last year, added Mukherjea.

 Earlier, Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh had written to the state government in response to its recommendations on the mode of governance and admission at Besu. Singh had stated that the upgrade proposal was being considered and the Anandakrishnan committees recommendations had not yet been accepted.

 The committee, which had assessed the seven institutes, had recommended a Rs 519-crore grant for infrastructure development at Besu. So far, the university has received Rs 10 crore in the final year of the Tenth Plan (2007).

 We dont know if an annual block grant or a recurring grant of Rs 50 crore, as recommended by the panel, will be allocated to us under the Eleventh Plan, said Mukherjea.

 If the recurring grant is cleared, the upgrade to INI status, which has to be brought about by an act in Parliament, will follow, according to Besu officials.

 A man and a woman were arrested on Monday for allegedly ransacking MR Bangur Hospital and beating up its staff members after the death of a patient because of medical negligence.

 According to police, Chandan Kumar Roy, 22, a resident of Behala, was admitted to the hospital around 2am on Monday with acute diarrhoea. He died around 10.30am. 

 When the hospital authorities gave Chandans family the news, his relatives and neighbours reacted angrily. They allegedly ransacked the emergency and male wards of the hospital and beat up a doctor and other hospital employees. 

 Chandans father Surender Prasad said he had seen his son walking in the hospital around 9am. He was quite fit. The doctor asked me to buy some medicines. When I returned, I was told that my son had died. They killed him, he alleged.

 Surender Prasad lodged a complaint with Jadavpur police station. The hospital authorities also complained to the police. Based on it, Rakesh Gupta and Kajal Mirdha, neighbours of the Roys, were arrested. 

 Acting resident medical officer Animesh Das Gupta said: The man was in a critical condition when he was admitted. The mob ransacked the hospital and beat up five employees, including a doctor.

 South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said: The body has been sent for post-mortem. 

 The house staff of the hospital started a ceasework from 6pm on Monday to protest the incident.

 An illegal bar under the sky, a drug cartel and a satta den all a few minutes walk from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees residence on Palm Avenue.

 A sense of insecurity has gripped the high-security neighbourhood in south Calcutta, as criminal activities thrive along the railway tracks nearby, between Park Circus and Ballygunge stations.

 Residents allege that the criminals enjoy the patronage of personnel of the railways and Calcutta police, as also CPM leaders. 

 Policemen can often be seen pocketing money from people running the rackets, said an elderly neighbour of the chief minister.

 To start with, an illegal bar runs 24x7 along the railway tracks, flanked by Rifle Range Road and Tiljala Road. Rows of men and women sell hooch and tari on both sides of the tracks. 

 The brew is produced in the nearby shanties, that have come up encroaching on railway land. During peak hours, customers can be seen sitting on the tracks and drinking.

 A few metres away, below Park Circus Bridge No. 4, sits a man on crutches. He sells ganja, charas and other intoxicating powders. The stuff is kept in a bag on his shoulder.

 From daily-wagers to nightclub-hoppers, his clientele is quite diverse. The man has never got into trouble with the authorities, says a resident of the locality.

 If liquor and drugs are freely available, gambling cannot be far behind. Every evening, stretches along the tracks are taken over by satta operators.

 The criminals enjoy absolute immunity, as they have bought off a section of policemen. There has not been any attempt by the authorities to root out the menace, says a resident. We feel scared when our children step out. And, come to think of it, this is the chief ministers neighbourhood, adds another.

 The railway police admit that unlawful activities thrive along the railway tracks in this area, but plead helplessness. We do conduct raids, but it is difficult to find a lasting solution to the problem. A permanent police picket means more manpower, which we do not have now, says Barun Mullick, superintendent of railway police, Sealdah.

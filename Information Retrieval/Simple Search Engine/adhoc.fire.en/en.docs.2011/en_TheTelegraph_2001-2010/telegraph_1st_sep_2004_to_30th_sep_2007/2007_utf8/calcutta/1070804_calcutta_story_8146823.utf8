The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bloody shirt has youth in cop net

 PRONAB MONDAL AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

A comedy of errors in Barasat, on the northern fringes of the city, forced a 27-year-old man to spend over 12 hours behind bars.

 While waiting for a train at Hridaypur station on Thursday night, Shibnath Sinha saw a woman, later identified as Sathi, suddenly pass out. Before her husband Subrata could react, the womans head hit a slab and she started bleeding. 

 Shibnath promptly responded to Subratas cries for help. The two men took the woman to a nearby medicine store. Then, after treatment, the couple hired a car and left, said Swapan Ghosh, a witness. 

 Shibnaths ordeal started after the couple left. By that time, the last train to Dum Dum had left and worse, his white shirt was stained with blood. 

 As he headed for Jessore Road in search of alternative transport, a police patrol van intercepted him near Dak Bungalow More and took him to Barasat police station. 

 The cops suspected him of being involved in a crime, which took place in Barasats Nabapally a few hours ago. 

 On Wednesday evening, a man was arrested from Nabapally for trying to kill his wife with a chopper. As there were reports that the man had some accomplices with him, police picked up Shibnath thinking he was a party to the crime.

 It is natural to get suspicious if a man is seen in blood-soaked clothes. My officers did nothing wrong, asserted Sasanka Sekhar Chakraborty, the officer-in-charge of Barasat police station. 

 People present in the police station when Shibnath was brought in have told Metro that the cops did not pay any heed to his requests to crosscheck his identity.

 He was thrown in the lock-up and the cops asked him to keep shut, said a witness to the atrocity in the police station. 

 Shibnath was released on Friday afternoon, more than 12 hours after he was put behind bars.

 As Shibnath was not arrested, there was no record maintained in the police station and the senior district police officers declined to comment on the issue.

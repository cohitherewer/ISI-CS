 Fresh pesticide cry in soft drinks

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Soft drink manufacturers have again been dragged to court over alleged pesticide content in their products.

 In a public interest litigation filed in Calcutta High Court on Monday, city-based NGO Diganta has alleged that pesticide has been found in products of several soft drink companies. The samples were collected from the market and sent for tests to National Test House (run by the Centre), in Alipore, and the state pollution control board.

 The results are alarming. The reports state that pesticide, a poison, has been found in the soft drinks. The companies should not be allowed to market their product in the state, submitted Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, who appeared for the petitioner. He produced copies of the reports.

 The division bench of Justice P.C. Ghosh and Justice B. Samaddar asked the companies to file affidavits in response to the petitioners statement.

 Denying the allegation, the lawyer appearing for the drink manufacturers said: Several petitions making similar claims were filed in courts across the country, but the charges were proved false.

 The court, however, rejected the petitioners demand for an interim order prohibiting the firms from issuing advertisements till further orders.

 The bench said the court had entertained a similar petition and asked the registrar to seek a report from a Delhi-based laboratory run by the Central Pollution Control Board. The report is yet to arrive.

 We will have to wait for the report, the bench observed, while asking the companies to file affidavits within three weeks. The matter will be heard again after four weeks.

 While intervening in a similar case moved in the court in February, green activist Subhas Dutta had prayed for an order directing soft drink manufacturers to mention the components on the label. 

 The court had assured him that the proposal would be considered latter.

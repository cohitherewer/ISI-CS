 One of every three traffic policemen in Calcutta has been found to be suffering from severe lung ailments, a consequence of their prolonged exposure to air pollution while on duty.

 The situation is worse in the more polluted northern parts of the city, like Shyambazar and Girish Park, where one of every two cops has fallen victim to the foul air they breathe.

 The figures have been thrown up by a study conducted by Cipla Respiratory (a pharmaceutical company), in collaboration with the traffic department of Calcutta Police.

 Around 30 per cent of the 600-odd policemen covered by the study have been diagnosed with decreased lung volume capacity, with moderate to severe blocks, said Supriyo Banerjee, who coordinated the project on behalf of Cipla. The figure rose to nearly 50 per cent in areas like Shyambazar and Girish Park.

 Kaushik Ghosh, a chest specialist at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital who attended a check-up camp at Lalbazar, said: Most of the policemen were found to have respiratory troubles, like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be linked to their exposure to pollution.

 The cops diagnosed with lung blocks have been advised to consult doctors at the earliest, said a Cipla official. According to the findings, many of them have severe cough in the upper airways, caused by smoking and exposure to pollution.

 The study started in Lalbazar in early March and then spread out across the city was carried out through peak flow master or lung thermometers and spirometry.

 Most of the policemen surveyed were stunned on being told about the findings. I regularly have cough and other bronchial problems, but used to neglect them. Now, I understand the severity of the situation and will never step out for work without wearing a mask, said a traffic sergeant who had undergone the test. Masks have been provided to all traffic cops, but only a handful use them.

 We have decided to take some measures to address the problem and will finalise them after receiving the detailed report, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic).

 An earlier study, by Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, had also revealed how pollution was taking toll on traffic police.

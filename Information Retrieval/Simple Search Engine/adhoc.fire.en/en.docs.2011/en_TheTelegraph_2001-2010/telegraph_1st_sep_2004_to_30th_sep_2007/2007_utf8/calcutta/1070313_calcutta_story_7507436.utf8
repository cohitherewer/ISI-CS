 Land scout for transport hub, park

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sprawling truck terminus, an interstate bus terminus and a traffic training institute, along with housing estates and shopping malls, will constitute a specialised transport township coming up at New Town, Rajarhat. 

 It will be a joint venture between the state government and a private partner. A seven-km, six-lane road will be built to connect the township with Jessore Road. 

 The state cabinet will decide on the acquisition of 305.67 acres of land for the project when it meets on Wednesday. According to the proposal, the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC) will acquire the land in Ganti and Gopalpur mouzas.

 The land will later be leased to Hyderabad-based Sew and Prasad, which has been selected through a tender. It has offered to pay Rs 96 crore for 200 acres, on which housing estates, shopping malls and food courts will be set up. 

 The money will be used by the WBTIDC to develop infrastructure, including the traffic training institute, interstate bus terminus and garages, on 30 acres. 

 The transport corporation will also set up a truck terminus on 50 acres. The people displaced for the project will be rehabilitated on 25 acres. 

 Land will also need to be acquired in six mouzas for the underground aquarium and amusement park that the state fisheries department is planning to set up with a private partner at Mukundapur, off EM Bypass. 

 The cabinet is expected to clear the proposal to acquire 585.6 acres in South 24-Parganas for the purpose on Wednesday. 

 The state cabinet will also decide on Wednesday on handing over 201.65 acres of government farmland in Haringhata to the Union human resources development ministry for setting up a campus of the Indian Institute of Science.

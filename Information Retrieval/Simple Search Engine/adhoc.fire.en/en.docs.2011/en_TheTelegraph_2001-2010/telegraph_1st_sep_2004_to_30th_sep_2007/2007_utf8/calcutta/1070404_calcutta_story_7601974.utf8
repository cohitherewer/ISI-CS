 Cancer cases under survey

 SANJAY MANDAL

 A comprehensive survey on cancer patients in the city is under way for the first time since 1995. The study will categorise the prevalence of various types of cancer on the basis of age, sex and religion of the patients and also list their dietary habits.

 The databank will enable the government to prepare a health policy aimed at preventing cancer, said Joydip Biswas, principal investigator of the project and director of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI).

 The centre has been selected the nodal agency of the survey, being funded by Indian Council of Medical Research. A team from the councils National Cancer Registry Programme was in town on Monday to hold talks with representatives of the various cancer hospitals and research institutes in the city.

 We are streamlining the data-processing system. A full-fledged databank is likely to be ready by the year-end, said A. Nandakumar, council deputy director-general and officer-in-charge of National Cancer Registry Programme.

 A core team has been set up to collect data from all state-run and private hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The data will be presented to the council for compilation, said Biswas.

 The last time a comprehensive cancer survey was undertaken in the city was in 1995. The process, spearheaded by CNCI, was completed in 2001.

 The new initiative will help us get a more recent picture of cancer occurrence in Calcutta, said Ashis Mukherjee, medical director, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute. It has forwarded the case studies of 5,000-odd patients to CNCI.

 A section of doctors, however, feel the survey could have thrown up a more authentic picture had the data been collected from individual households, instead of hospitals. 

 Several patients from the districts and neighbouring states get admitted to city hospitals by providing a local address, pointed out Subir Ganguly, head of the department of radiotherapy, NRS Medical College and Hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Thick fog logs out flights

 - Schedules go haywire as early morning visibility drops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dense fog threw flight services haywire on Friday morning.

 Officials said around 20 domestic and international flights took off from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport hours behind schedule.

 Several incoming flights, too, were affected, including one of Kingfisher Airlines, in which Amitabh Bachchan was coming from Mumbai. The flight landed at 9.30 am, late by 40 minutes.

 The airport and its surrounding areas were shrouded in fog at 4 am. By 5.30 am, visibility dropped to below 50 metres.

 An Indian flight to Mumbai was the first to take off, at 8.15 am, instead of 6 am. A Port Blair-bound flight of the airline left at 8.45 am, full three hours behind schedule. 

 A Jet Airways flight for the island left at 8.49 am, instead of 5 am.

 A British Airways flight to London, rescheduled from 4.55 am to 8 am, could finally leave at 9.04 am. There was severe congestion on the runway after the fog thinned and visibility became manageable, said an official of the British Airways.

 A Jet Airways flight from Chennai was first to land in Calcutta, at 8.47 am, instead of 7 am. An Indian flight from Bangalore arrived at 9.15 am, 45 minutes behind schedule.

 Sources in the Air Traffic Control said a number of flights were on hold in the sky for minutes. Some of them had to circle in the air for as long as 40 minutes, an official said.

 The Airports Authority of India has installed the Category-II Instrumental Landing System on the primary runway, which allows aircraft to land even when visibility is as low as 350 metres. But the system is yet to be made operational, as an upgrade of the safety equipment is pending.

 The installation of the Category-I system on the secondary runway will start soon.

 Met officials at the airport said the morning fog was caused by a combination of factors. A low-pressure trough extending from Karnataka to the Bengal coast has been drawing in moist air from the Bay since Thursday afternoon. 

 Officials said the moist air mingled with the cold air in the lower levels of the atmosphere, resulting in fog.

 The clear sky, light wind and a lack of disturbance in the atmosphere led to the formation of dense fog, said A.K. Das, director, Calcutta airports Met office.

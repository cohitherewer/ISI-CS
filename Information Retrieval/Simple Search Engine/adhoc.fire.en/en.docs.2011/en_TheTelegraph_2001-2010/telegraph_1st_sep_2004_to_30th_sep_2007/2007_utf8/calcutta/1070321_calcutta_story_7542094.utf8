 Beyond a ringside view

 The circus. A world of colours, festoons, confetti and shades of glitz. Yet, photographer Saibal Das has captured this world of fun, frolic and fantasy in stark, sober tones of black and white. Perhaps, his interest lies far beyond the world of illusion that circus artistes conjure up for us in the ring. Das has drawn our attention to the real world that they inhabit, where survival and livelihood are tougher than triple somersaults on the trampoline. Mera Naam Joker, his ongoing exhibition of circus photographs, reveals poignant human moments of circus life. A girl who performs with a lioness is seen sitting dispassionately in front of a mirror donning her make-up, while the lioness paws her shoulders affectionately. Yearning for stardom, conventional family life, or freedom from rigorous routine, circus performers must inevitably put on their costumes, ride up the ladder and fly through the air on a trapeze in their elusive quest to escape into the world that we live in.

 Event: Circus photographs by Saibal Das When: Till March 21; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

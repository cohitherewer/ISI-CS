 Language lessons 

for teachers

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 More than 100 schoolteachers and lecturers from West Bengal and Jharkhand took part in an English teaching workshop organised by the US consulate at the American Center on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

 The workshop is designed to train the trainers. The teachers and lecturers can utilise the techniques taught to make learning more interesting and comprehensive, explained Richard A. Boyum, director of the Regional English Language Office at the consulates Delhi office. He, along with other experts across India, conducted the workshop. 

 The programme was divided into four sessions that focused on advanced teaching techniques for those who have English as second language. 

 At the workshop, the teachers were asked to help their students to develop vocabulary with the aid of books, music and videos. The last session focussed on promoting critical thinking and exploring culture with the help of language.

 The sessions have helped me realise the difference between students who have English as their first language and those who have it as their second language. I can use what I learnt to help my students, said Kirtiwas Kumar, a lecturer from Ranchi. 

 I am a retired professor of Manipur University. I am here to pick up tips to make my classes more interesting, said 65-year-old Sunanda Datta, who works as a part-time lecturer at Netaji Subhash Open University.

 With the growing competition, economic boom and globalisation, fluency and in-depth knowledge of English is important for job opportunities in any sector, stressed the teachers.

 Sixty per cent of the students who crack the joint entrance examination cant communicate well in English. This prevents them from getting into MNCs. I feel these techniques might help us to improve their language skills, said Arun Mitra, head of career development programme, Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Online address for tech jobs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Valley Soft, a US-based information technology (IT) services and solutions provider with offshore operations in the city, is set to launch the countrys first job portal www.jobsbridge.com focussing exclusively on the tech sector.

 The company incorporated in Santa Clara, California, launched the US version of the portal a month ago.

 We are in the process of customising the website to cater to the needs of the Indian IT employers and employees. It should be ready for launch in five to six months. There are online portals focussing on IT jobs, along with those in other sectors. Our portal, for the first time in India, will concentrate only on the IT sector, claimed Himanshu Samal, head of Valley Soft operations in Calcutta.

 The company has invested $35,000 for developing the US version of the website. It would invest a similar amount for the Indian version, too.

 The website would offer online assessment tests for prospective employees. Valley Soft wants to tie-up with industry bodies like Nasscom to offer tests to judge employability of candidates in business process outsourcing units.

 We are holding discussions in this regard. Nothing concrete has emerged as yet, stated Samal.

 The website would provide a list of probable interview questions for IT jobs to help employees.

 Big-ticket recruiters can set up accounts on the website. The account managers designated by the companies will have access to the accounts.

 After several instances of fraud came to light, many IT companies engage agencies to verify the curriculum vitae of prospective employees. The US version of jobsbridge.com offers services to employers, like social security and credit history checks.

 We want to offer similar services on the Indian version of the website for the benefit of the recruiters, said Samal.

 Valley Soft would soon move to its new 6,000-sq-ft office in Sector V. It plans to ramp up the employee strength from 70 to 150 by the end of the year.

 The company has recently signed a $125-million software development deal with US-based Sigmanet, which is an IT procurement company specialising in retail market.

 Boycott on campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The SFI-led Postgraduate Students Union of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) has started an indefinite boycott of classes to press for the immediate appointment of a placement coordinator.

 The protesters squatted in the lobby on Thursday morning and brought out a march on the campus.

 The university has a placement coordinator, but the postgraduate students want one exclusively for themselves.

 Acting registrar Bhaswati Mitra ruled out appointing a second coordinator. There is no question of appointing another coordinator. It is not possible for any engineering institute to provide 100 per cent placement. Besu cannot be an exception, said Mitra. She pleaded ignorance about any class boycott.

 The university authorities met student representatives in the afternoon to sort out the impasse, but no solution could be found. Among those who attended the meeting were dean of engineering Debasis Ghosh, dean of science S.P. Goswami, head of human resources development Manas Kumar Sanyal and acting registrar Mitra.

 Union representative Riddhi Mukherjee said: The vice-chancellor had assured us in October last that a placement coordinator would be appointed especially for the postgraduate students. But he has not done anything since then.

 Corrupt officers return to jail

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday upheld the verdict of a CBI court, which had sentenced two income-tax inspectors to three years rigorous imprisonment for demanding a bribe from an NGO.

 Demanding a bribe is a heinous crime. The special CBI court should have sentenced the officers to seven years rigorous imprisonment, observed Justice Asim Kumar Roy of the high court, while hearing the appeal. 

 He also asked the guilty inspectors Arun Bhattacharya and Sambhunath Samaddar to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 each

 According to sources, Southern Health Improvement Samity, an NGO based in Bhangar, in South 24-Parganas, had been enjoying tax exemption under Section 18G of Income-Tax Act since 1986. According to the norms, any NGO availing of such a privilege has to collect a renewal certificate every year.

 In 1995, when the NGO applied for the certificate, tax inspectors Bhattacharya and Samaddar had demanded Rs 25,000 to issue the certificate, sources said.

 Secretary of the NGO, Mohammad Abdul Wohab, said his organisation could not pay such a huge amount. 

 The officers scaled down the amount and said they would clear the certificate after receiving Rs 20,000. Wohab then lodged a complaint with the CBI. 

 On December 18, a team of CBI officials caught the two under the Prevention of Corruption Act while they were accepting the bribe from Wohab.

 In 2001, a special CBI court in Alipore found the two guilty and sentenced them to three years rigorous imprisonment. 

 The inspectors moved the high court challenging the trial courts verdict and got an interim bail in 2001.

 The appeal was heard on Wednesday, after a gap of six years. Justice Roy, in his verdict, asked the officials to send the duo back to jail.

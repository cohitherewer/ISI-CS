 Kin firm on CBI inquiry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two hours before the chief minister ordered a judicial probe into the death of Rizwanur Rahman on Thursday, his mother Kishwar Jahan and elder brother Rukbanur moved a writ petition in Calcutta High Court, praying that the CBI be called in.

 Moving the petition before Justice Soumitra Pal, advocate and former Trinamul Congress MLA Kalyan Banerjee said: My clients do not think they will get justice if the probe is conducted by state government officials. So, we are requesting you to appoint the CBI to conduct the probe.

 Even after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees announcement of a judicial probe, the Rahman family stuck to its demand. After my brother was hounded to death by the police force, how can we have any faith in the state government machinery? Only a CBI inquiry can bring out the truth, said Rukbanur.

 They have ordered a judicial inquiry, but the police officers responsible for his death are still holding their posts. Why have they not been removed for the sake of an impartial investigation? he demanded.

 Banerjee claimed that the senior police officers had violated the law by meddling in the matter without registering a case. Fearing that Rizwanur was murdered, he said a CBI inquiry could run parallel to the judicial probe.

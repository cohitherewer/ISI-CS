 Good guest guide

 Blend well and behave right to be a regular invitee. Anumita Ghosh tells you how

 Inform your host about your attendance. 

 Being in the guests shoes, theres little you can contribute to the success of a party. Wrong. No fights, no fuss, harmless flirting, loads of fun, some flattery and the guest makes the party. What happens when any of these goes wrong? An affair to remember, for all the wrong reasons.

 Heres the GoodLife guide to be a good guest, one your host would invite every time theres a party.

 Conduct code

 Pre-party 

 The RSVP on the card is for you to respond, ASAP. Whether you confirm your presence or regret your absence, getting back to your host is a must. Says Mumbai-based grooming expert Chhaya Momaya: It is of great help. The host can count the number of heads and act accordingly. For a last-minute no, make it a point to message or call. Keep the explanation simple and short. Your host is too busy to be bogged down with your details, adds Chhaya.

 Finishing school expert Uma Mazumdar warns against taking uninvited friends or family members along. Inform your host; gauge whether the extra head can be accommodated or not. 

 Asking about the guest profile is downright rude. It indicates your presence is dictated by the guest list and not the hosts invitation.

 Punctuality counts. In case of formal parties, one should never arrive later than the chief guest.

 Carry a gift. Wine, chocolate it could be anything. Expensive or not, its the thought that counts. In case of large or heavy gifts, have it sent ahead of the party. Not to be at the venue empty-handed, carry flowers. Do not carry food without checking with your host. Asking beforehand is more like lending a helping hand. Otherwise, it seems you are not sure of the kind of food to be served, warns Chhaya.

 At the party

 On arrival, reach out to your host first, youll have enough time to socialise later. In some Indian homes, the guests are often shown around the house. The host might be your closest pal, but ask his/her permission before you start showing others around, cautions Chhaya.

 Blend well with the occasion. Be a considerate guest. It always helps the host when you make an unknown guest (to you) feel at home. Helping the host is good, but do not overdo it. Do not start playing the hosts role, cautions Uma. 

 Chhaya also stresses the behaviour basics. You might not approve of some people, or there might be someone who is goading you on to a better-avoided topic, but keep your calm, she adds.

 Be careful about the furniture. Shifting art objects around, placing used plates and glasses here and there is not done, says Chhaya.

 Leave the party

 Time it right. The party might be over, but the host has to co-ordinate the final wrap-up. Do not linger after the party. Finally, keep your goodbyes short. Remember, the host has others to look after. 

 Dress diktat

 It takes a minute to put you into a slot. Dress sensibly enough not to intimidate the host and others. It could drop one from the guest list forever, cautions style consultant Sunipa Samadder. 

 Respect the dress code. Do not wear your profession to a party. Sweating in your polyester shirt straight from work is a no-no. Take care of body odour.

 Heres more on the dress code for specific parties:

 Business formal

 The look has to be neat. Go for neutral shades and avoid heavy embellishments and neon colours. The silhouette should be no-frills, no-fancies. A structured, classic silhouette is apt. 

 Add some colour in the form of a scarf or stole, says Sunipa. Stay away from batuas, cross-bags and sequinned chappals. Footwear could be smart moccasins, solid-coloured stilettos and platforms. Nude make-up with highlighted lips or eyes.

 Traditional take 

 Colours like red, fuchsia, mauves and oranges are easy to get you into celebration mode. To stand out in traditional casuals, go for drapes with khadi blouses. Suits with pretty printed churidars and dupattas draped interestingly will also look traditional yet casual, says Sunipa. Pep it up with dressy footwear mojri, sequinned tie-ups, slip-ons. Wear colour on your face matching the outfit.

 Informal do

 For birthday parties or a casual get-together, go for skirts, capris or denims. The colour code could be bright and happy. 

 If you have a helping-hand role to play, make sure your dress does not come in the way, cautions Sunipa.

 Table talk 

 Get your dining etiquette right. Let your host ask you to your meal and also let him/her decide the seating arrangement, says Uma. When asked about beverage preferences, enquire about what is on offer.

 Your eating pace should be in tune with others. Stretching your arm across someones plate for the sauce is a big no-no, says Uma.

 Be sure about basic cutlery use. And when unsure, the trick is to watch others. If you drop cutlery or spill a drink, just apologise.

 Eating must be punctuated by a little chit-chat with guests on either side.

 In case of a buffet, make sure you move away from the buffet table after serving yourself. Come back for a second helping, dont pile your plate.

 Do 

 Inform your host about your attendance. 

 Time it right. Be it entry or exit.

 Dress for the occasion. A dress code on the invite is meant to be respected. 

 Know your limits. Gossip, PNPC or drinks mdash; too much of any is the key to disaster. 

 Don rsquo;t

 Be the social butterfly. Mingle slow and steady.

 Overdress or under-dress. Be neat and clean. 

 Be a sloppy eater. Dine with confidence, charm and care.

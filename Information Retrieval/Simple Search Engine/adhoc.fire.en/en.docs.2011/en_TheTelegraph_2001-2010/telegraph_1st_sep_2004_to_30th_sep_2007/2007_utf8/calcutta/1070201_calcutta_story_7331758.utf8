 Protect panel in penury

 - Heritage body unaware of threat to Nandigram shrines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Pratap Chandra Chunder, chairman, West Bengal Heritage Commission, made a frank admission of the inadequacy of the body meant to protect the innumerable heritage structures in the state, hampered as it was by the lack of funds and infrastructure. 

 Chunder was releasing Aitihya, the first issue of the commissions bulletin, on Wednesday.

 Funds come in dribs and drabs, but Rs 10-12 crore is expected in the near future. Chunder has made appeals for public funding and Terai tea estate has promised Rs 2 lakh. Fifty-two houses outside Calcutta have been chosen for conservation and work is continuing on them. 

 This is over and above the 1,300 already selected by the Calcutta Municipal Corporations heritage committee.

 Asked if the commission had any information on the ancient mosques and temples that perhaps exist at Nandigram, whose takeover has been proposed to set up a special economic zone, Chunder said the body was not aware if any such place of worship stands there.

 Also, it cannot take any action unless mass petitions or applications are made to draw its attention to these structures, which face the possibility of demolition. We want to stay out of politics, he declared quite categorically.

 Chunder said amendment of the West Bengal Commission Act and inclusion of a penal provision was being sought. Or else, the commission would remain ineffective. 

 Now, the commission cannot take any action unless it petitions the local body. The proposed amendment would allow it to act directly.

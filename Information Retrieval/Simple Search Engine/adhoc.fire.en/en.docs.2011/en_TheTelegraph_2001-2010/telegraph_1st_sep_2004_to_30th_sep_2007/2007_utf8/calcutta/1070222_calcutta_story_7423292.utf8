 - Admit guilt or face inquiry: Options before suspended OC 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Cops at Tollygunge police station were under instruction to keep an eye on Kumar Shah, accused in murder, extortion and rioting cases. But that did not deter them from inviting him to a blood donation camp held at the thana last Saturday.

 Shahs presence at the do in the company of singers, professors and other personalities had kicked off a furore, forcing the police top brass to suspend the officer-in-charge (OC) of the thana, Ashim Ghosh.

 Ghosh was held responsible because the blood donation camp was organised under his supervision. As officer-in-charge of the thana, he has to take the blame for any untoward or embarrassing event at the camp, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Tollygunge thana was under specific instruction from deputy commissioner (south) Ajoy Kumar to keep a tab on Kumar, accused in more than 30 cases, said an officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.

 At the camp, Kumar was seen hobnobbing with a number of policemen in full view of the public. He also got five of his accomplices donate blood. 

 Deputy commissioner Ajoy Kumar was present at the inauguration of the camp, but left before the accused reached there. After receiving a number of complaints from local residents, he informed police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee about the incident.

 The police chief asked the deputy commissioner to immediately send him a note. Acting on the written communique, Mukherjee ordered the OCs suspension.

 Elaborating on the next course of action, deputy commissioner (headquarters) Chatterjee said Ghosh would be handed over a chargesheet in a couple of days. He will be given two options admit the guilt or prefer a probe.

 There will be an inquiry if he demands one. The police commissioner will decide on the quantum of punishment if the inquiry finds Ghosh guilty, Chatterjee explained.

 By suspending Ghosh, the police chief wanted to send a message across to the force. The case will serve as a warning to other officers, said another senior officer at Lalbazar.

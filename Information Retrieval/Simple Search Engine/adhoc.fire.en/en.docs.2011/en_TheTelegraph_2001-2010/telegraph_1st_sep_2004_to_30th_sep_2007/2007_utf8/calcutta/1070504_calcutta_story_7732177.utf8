 The City Diary

 Three children were handed over to the governments child protection cell after they were found on a bus on the Barasat-Dharamtala route, on Thursday morning. Co-passenger Jayan Mukherjee informed police when he saw two youths escorting the children. The police said the children are from Deganga, in North 24-Parganas, and were headed for Mumbai to work in a tailoring shop. The police informed their families, who said they knew the youths.

 Three youths were arrested for their involvement in a racket supplying forged appointment letters. Police said Trilok Biswas, in his mid-20s, was arrested when he went to the fire services headquarters on Free School Street with a fake appointment letter. He had appeared for an examination and passed successfully. But he was disqualified in the interview round. Police said Pintu Halder and Jibesh Biswas assured him a job and demanded Rs 1.5 lakh. Later, Halder and Biswas were arrested at their Habra residence.

 Three youths were held on charges of taking photographs of a woman while she was changing her clothes in the trial room of a garment shop on Topsia South Road. The woman, in her mid-30s, lodged a complaint. She said she noticed someone trying to peep in from the keyhole of the door. She opened the door and found a youth trying to run away with his mobile phone. She raised an alarm.

 Sunil Mehra, head cashier of a nationalised bank on Ezra Street, was arrested for misappropriating more than Rs 2 lakh from a bank vault. Police said Mehra was arrested at his Baguiati residence, following a complaint lodged by the bank authorities. His family members on Thursday refunded the money. Mehra was remanded in police custody till Saturday.

 The city and its fringes experienced brief power cuts on Thursday evening as the shortfall in the CESC-served areas rose to about 60 MW, after the state electricity-distribution company imposed a restriction on its supply to the CESC.

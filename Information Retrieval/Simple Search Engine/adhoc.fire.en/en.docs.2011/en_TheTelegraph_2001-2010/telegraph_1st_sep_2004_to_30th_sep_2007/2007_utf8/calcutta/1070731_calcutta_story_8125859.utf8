 The race course ground on which the government is trying to build a sports complex

 The state government is considering a proposal to set up a sports complex on the race course ground, sports minister Subhas Chakraborty said in the Assembly on Monday.

 The government is yet to come up with a concrete plan, but considering the fact that there is a shortage of space for popular games like khokho, basketball, hockey and volleyball, the government is keen on using a part of the race course for setting up a small sports complex, the minister said in response to a question from Jaane Alam Mian (CPI).

 Defending the move, which has drawn criticism from several quarters, Chakraborty said the race course operates only twice a week and interest in racing is on the wane.

 On the other hand, an increasing number of youths, including women, are taking up games like basketball, volleyball, khokho and swimming. But the Maidan is not enough to meet the surge in demand for sporting space.

 The sports complex at Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC), he suggested, would help ease the space crunch. There is a plan to set up enclosures to enable athletes to practise on a regular basis. There is also a plan to build swimming pools in the proposed complex.

 A senior engineer has been engaged to draw up a concrete plan for the complex.

 The government has held talks on the issue with the army the owner of the race course ground and also the defence ministry. The talks are at a preliminary stage. The chief secretary will soon meet the army authorities, Chakraborty said.

 RCTC officials, however, expressed surprise over the governments move. The club has no information about the plan to set up a sports complex here, said Kishore Bhimani, a steward at RCTC.

 Chakraborty said the government is examining how the race courses are functioning in Pune and Mumbai, where the grounds have been shifted.

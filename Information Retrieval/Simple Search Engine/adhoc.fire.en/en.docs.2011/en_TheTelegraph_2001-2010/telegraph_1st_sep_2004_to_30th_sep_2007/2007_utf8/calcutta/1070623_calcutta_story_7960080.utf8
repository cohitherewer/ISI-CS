The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sell movie with sound of music 

 - Live gigs at strategic venues to promote Calcutta films awaiting release

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 play ON: Shayan Munshi in a scene from The Bong Connection

 Got a movie to sell? Let the music play. Thats the new mantra for some of the most exciting films coming out of Calcutta in the next few weeks.

 The production companies of Bow Barracks Forever, The Bong Connection and Anuranan are all having live music gigs at strategic venues to promote their films among their target groups.

 First up, Anjan Dutts long-in-queue Bow Barracks Forever. Backed by Pritish Nandy Communications, the film is spreading the sound of music with three back-to-back live concerts in Mumbai, Pune and Calcutta, featuring the Bow Street Blues. 

 The band comprising Dutt himself and music composer son Neel, among others already performed at Not Just Jazz By The Bay in Mumbai on Thursday night and Punes popular nightclub Soho on Friday night. The gig at Someplace Else on Saturday night will round off the Bow Barracks Forever musical promotion.

 Through the concerts, we are trying to create the nostalgia of the Anglo-Indian community of the 1960s, Neel tells Metro. So, along with the original tracks from the film, we are singing Cliff Richard, Elvis Presley, Paul Anka.... In between, we are showing trailers from Bow Barracks Forever and talking about the film.

 The flavour changes completely for the promotional shows of Anjan Dutts The Bong Connection. And so do the venues. The Dutts this time will perform at places like St Xaviers College, Cafe Coffee Day and Oh! Calcutta to promote the July 6 release.

 We want the youth to understand that its not a serious art film and by performing on campuses and at coffee shops, we are trying to reach out to them, says Anjan. And since Bangla band music is more popular than contemporary Bangla cinema, its the best possible medium.

 Joining the Dutts at the several makeshift venues would be Bangla band musicians like Rupam (frontman of Fossils) and Siddhartha (vocalist of Cactus), and Usha Uthup. Everything, from hard rock to baul music, will play out and the cast of the film is expected to sing along.

 For Aniruddha Roy Chowdhurys Anuranan, though, it will be an informal jam session with percussionist Tanmoy Bose. Says producer Jeet Banerjee: Its not a music-based movie and so we are just trying to recreate a scene where Tanmoy joins the protagonists on a night-out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Safe SMS twist to tale

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Mehak Ahuja had reportedly sent a second SMS to her father on March 11, stating that the threat of a terror attack on the Delhi-bound IndiGo flight had blown over.

 Maninder Ahuja claims to have promptly passed on the message Dad everything safe... to the airline, but the airport authorities still acted on Mehaks first SMS, warning of an impending terror attack, and recalled the plane to Calcutta airport.

 Mehaks counsel Krishnendu Sarkar said the second message was forwarded to the airline at 7.41 pm, four minutes before the flight took off.

 The flight was called back at 7.47 pm, on the basis of the first message my client had sent to her father at 7.31 pm. That was forwarded to the airline at 7.35 pm, the lawyer added.

 The 25-year-old student of a Delhi-based management institute was deplaned and arrested on charges of disrupting flight and causing harm on board. She was released on bail on Saturday.

 The Delhi-bound flight was scheduled to take off at 7.15 pm. Around 7.30 pm, as Mehak was standing in the security zone, she noticed three persons pointing at a spot and saying that maximum disaster would take place if it could be planted there, said a family member of Mehak.

 Becoming suspicious, she sent an SMS to her father at 7.31 pm, which read: my flight is terrorist bounded did not take off yet.

 By the time the message was forwarded to the airline at 7.35 pm, Mehak had entered the aircraft and saw the three moving away with a policeman.

 She immediately messaged her father: Dad everything safe taking off bye love u.

 Asked about the second SMS, a spokesperson for the airline told Metro from Delhi: We had conveyed to police every detail of the communication during the period.

 The FIR lodged by IndiGo, however, referred only to the first SMS.

 The airport authorities were not forthcoming on the issue, though a senior officer of the CISF, in charge of the airports security, said on condition of anonymity that the all-clear message was not passed on to the airport authorities.

 Police said they are investigating the case acting on a complaint lodged by IndiGo. We are verifying what had happened during that period. If it is found that the airline officials had suppressed the fact (of the second SMS), we would take action accordingly, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

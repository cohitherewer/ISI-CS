 HC gives rickshaw licence victory

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments move to phase out hand-drawn rickshaws from city streets received a jolt on Tuesday, when the high court set aside a directive by the civic authority refusing to renew licences.

 Following an amendment to the Calcutta Hackney Carriage Bill, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had issued a notification on December 27 last year, refusing to renew licences of hand-pulled rickshaws.

 On December 15, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had announced that rickshaws would be phased out from the city within two months, on humanitarian grounds.

 The government had then introduced the Calcutta Hackney Carriage (Amendment) Bill in the Assembly.

 Challenging the validity of the CMC notification, the Calcutta Handrickshaw-Pullers Association on Tuesday moved a petition in the high court. Appearing for the association, Kazi Safiullah claimed that the CMCs notification was arbitrary and against provisions laid down in the Constitution.

 Justice Dipankar Dutta, after hearing the petition, passed an interim order stating the CMC had no authority to issue such a notification.

 A bill can never be construed as the law and no statutory authority has the right to issue any notification on the basis of a bill, observed Justice Dutta.

 He asked the CMC to file an affidavit stating what law empowered it to issue such a notification. The matter will be heard after four weeks.

 The government had announced that it would make alternative arrangements for us before imposing a ban on slow vehicles. Nothing has been done till date, said a representative of the rickshaw-pullers association.

 2000 homes coming up

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has decided to hand over 2,000-odd flats to their buyers in the current financial year. 

 The flats are coming up in Salt Lake, Golf Green, Golf Garden, Baishnabghata, Bagha Jatin, the East Calcutta Development Project area on EM Bypass, and Barrackpore and Kalyani.

 The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by CMDA chairman and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 We hope to deliver the flats in six-seven months. Work is on in full swing, said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.

 Around 85 flats for the higher income group are being readied in Salt Lakes CL block, at an investment of more than Rs 6.5 crore.

 Around 160 flats in the East Calcutta Development Project area are likely to be handed over this month. They could not be completed because of objections raised by the state pollution control board over the installation of a lift.

 The problem has been resolved and the board has given its clearance. Fire department officers, too, have inspected the 10-storeyed building and their suggestions are being implemented. We hope to hand over the flats this month, Baviskar said.

 Around 260 flats are being constructed in a Baishnabghata project. The first batch of the flats will be handed over by May and the second lot in December, Baviskar added.

 The CMDA is also constructing 64 flats and a commercial centre-cum-community hall in Kalyani Housing Scheme (Phase II).

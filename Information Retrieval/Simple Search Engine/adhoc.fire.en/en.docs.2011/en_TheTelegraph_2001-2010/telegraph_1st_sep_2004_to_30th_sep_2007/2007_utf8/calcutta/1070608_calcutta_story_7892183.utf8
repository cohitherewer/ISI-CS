 Illegal ad boards go under the axe

 The VIP Road skyline underwent a dramatic change for the better on Thursday, when the public works department (PWD) pulled down several billboards. 

 We dismantled 24 illegal billboards on a four-km stretch of VIP Road, between Durgapur bridge, at Ultadanga, and Dum Dum Park, said K. Sinha, executive engineer, PWD (roads).

 This drive could have come earlier, but we had to wait for the Salt Lake municipality and Lake Town police station to join us, said Sinha. 

 Six groups of PWD workmen simultaneously started the dismantle drive on Thursday morning around 11.30am. 

 The men used gas cutters and pliers to rip off and pull down the billboards, while curious onlookers gathered to watch them in action. The iron girders were cut and removed to the PWD godown.

 We had started the process of identifying the illegal billboards eight months ago, said the engineer. The department had compiled particulars of the advertising agencies that had valid licences for erecting a billboard. 

 The sizes and shapes of the licensed billboards were listed two months ago with help from the police and they were identified and marked, said a PWD official on Thursday.

 It was easy identifying the illegal ones once we identified the licensed billboards. We lodged a complaint with Lake Town police station against the owners of these billboards and carried out the demolition drive, he said.

 Owners of the billboards were, however, taken unawares by the removal drive. 

 Local political leaders had assured us that our billboards would not be dismantled. But they have not kept their promise and now we are left in the lurch, said an owner of a billboard that was pulled down by PWD men on Thursday. 

 We had invested over Rs 50,000 on the construction of each billboard. Also, we had to spend a huge amount of money on the iron girders. We lost several lakh of rupees in the drive, he said.

 As illegal billboards often sprout up in the space of a week, we have to remain vigilant, said Sinha.

 Panel of experts to scan HS marking

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Monday directed the state Higher Secondary (HS) council to set up a panel of experts to ascertain whether the evaluation of the physics and mathematics answer scripts of a student had been fair.

 Justice B. Somadder issued the order on a petition by Paulomi Biswas, an HS 2007 candidate, who had sought a re-evaluation of her mathematics script, in which she had scored 39.

 Two months ago, the judge had passed an order asking the council to constitute a committee to re-examine the answer scripts of some aggrieved students. The council appealed against the order before a division bench, arguing that its rules do not allow re-assessment.

 While the appeal was still pending, the petitioner, Debolina Barua, a student of a Salt Lake school, withdrew the case.

 With the appeal becoming inoperative, the council got a breather.

 But after hearing Paulomis plea on Monday, the judge ruled: Since the court is not the competent authority to judge whether the examiners had evaluated the answers properly, we are directing the council to set up a committee of three independent experts to find out whether the mathematics and physics scripts of the student had been assessed fairly.

 The panel will have to submit its report on September 11, when the matter will again come up for hearing.

 Though Paulomi, who appeared in the HS from a Barasat school, had alleged under-marking in only the mathematics paper, the judge included physics on his own.

 I was given only 39 in mathematics. Because of the low score, I did not get a berth in any engineering stream and was offered architecture by the joint entrance examination board, Paulomi had stated in her petition.

 In response to the plea, the judge had asked the council to produce the model answers to the physics and mathematics questions that the examiners had followed while awarding marks.

 The council produced the answers after a division bench overruled its objections but the judge found they were not tallying with the information in the textbooks.

 On Monday, Paulomi placed before the judge a mathematics textbook approved by the council and submitted that her answers were correct according to it.

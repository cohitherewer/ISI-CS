 Theres something fishy about a pond in Alipore, bordering the Bodyguard Lines.

 The armed police constables of barrack No. 6 woke up to a strange sight on Tuesday the adjoining pond was covered in what looked like a sheet of ice. A closer look revealed a horrific sight hundreds of dead fish. All adrift in the waterbody, like victims of a mass destruction.

 This raised quite a stink at Bodyguard Lines, with inmates sniffing foul play.

 Some constables poisoned the pond on Monday evening to settle a score, after being denied a share of the catch, alleged a constable of the Third Battalion, on condition of anonymity.

 A regular at the pond site every morning, the constable explained: On Monday, the man who is the lease-holder of the pond had come to claim his catch. His men netted a huge haul, including carp, mrigel and baata.

 When they were about to leave the site, some constables, who had gathered at the pond, demanded a part of the haul. The man refused and this led to a scuffle. The constables denied their share even threatened the man with dire consequences, he recounted.

 According to a barrack inmate, on Monday evening, some of our boys decided to take revenge by pouring poison into the pond water.

 The result was visible within hours. At dawn, the pond resembled a holocaust zone, said a constable.

 The news swam fast, as did the denials. Even if a large number of fish has died, there is no reason to believe that someone had poured poison into the water to settle a score. The deaths could be due to heat or due to the feed that the fish were given, said Debasish Kanjilal, unit secretary of the Calcutta Police Association, Third and Seventh battalions.

 We do receive complaints when some of our boys try their hand at angling in the pond but this is the first time in almost a decade that such a thing has happened, he added.

 Sukhendu Chakrabarty, joint director of fisheries, said the basic reason for such a large-scale death of fish was the change in toxicity levels of the water. This can happen either due to toxins being released from the underground muck after netting is done or the use of mohua extracts that harm small fish. The best way out would be to test the water and some of the dead fish in a lab, he added.

 Spread over almost a bigha, the pond was reportedly taken on lease for a year by Mrityunjay Nashkar, the relative of a constable of the Third Battalion, Chiranjeet Ghosh. The police association members said Nashkar paid Rs 12,000 for the lease.

 Nashkar, however, denied having paid any amount and claimed he was merely looking after the pond. I believe that the deaths were caused by the feed that was offered. It can happen in this heat, he said. 

 Late on Tuesday, joint commissioner Zulfikar Hassan said no official complaint had been filed, but a decision had been taken to look into the charges.

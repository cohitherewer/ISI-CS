 Cop hunt for body identity 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police are still clueless about the identity of the youth whose body was found near Delhi Road, in Bally, late on Tuesday. Officers initially thought the man, in his early 20s, was killed in an accident, but the post-mortem suggested he had been strangled.

 We are trying to find out the identity of the man. All sources have been activated, said Milan Das, additional superintendent of police (town).

 The body was spotted near Bamundanga Bridge, on Delhi Road, by a police patrol team. 

 From the looks, it seems the man was from a well-off family. He was wearing branded jeans and a tee, said an officer of Bally police station.

 There was not a single piece of paper on the body that could give us any clues. Nor was any wallet found. All this suggest professional killers had been hired for the job, the officer added.

 Police had registered an unnatural death case before sending the body for post-mortem.

 But the examination revealed he had been killed. There was a mark around the throat that suggested the youth had been strangulated with a rope-like object, said Harasit Sarkar, the medico-legal officer who conducted the post-mortem.

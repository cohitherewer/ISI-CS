 Simian Whippy

 Screen On amp; Off 

 This Sunday it is the turn of Hugh John Mungo Grant (in picture) to engage in a tete-a-tete with James Lipton on Inside the Actors Studio. In case you are still wondering about those middle names, well, hes your very own Notting Hill star Hugh Grant. On the PIX show you can get up close and personal with the man who may have great looks, but more importantly has the talent to take home the Venice Film Festival Best Actor Award, The British Academy Best Actor Award and the Golden Globe award.

 On the show, you can catch Hugh sharing some little-known facts about his life. The Four Weddings and a Funeral man actually started by performing in a British comedy sketch group called The Jockeys of Norfolk. His production company is called Simian Films, named by actress Elizabeth Hurley who felt that he resembled an ape or a monkey. 

 On the set of Mickey Blue Eyes, James Caan gave Hugh the nickname of Whippy. Caans explanation: Hugh worried about everything, like the little whippet dogs that get nervous and you got to put a sweater on them when theyre cold!

 Catch Hugh in the Studio on Sunday at 7 pm on PIX.

 Dancing king

 Amidst rave reviews for his performance in Guru, Mithun Chakraborty (in picture) is having a film festival dedicated to him on MAX. Ten of Mithundas biggest blockbusters are finding pride of place on the channel. In his inimitable style, Mithun says: Door se jo dikhta hai woh sona nahin hota. I am an example for people. Aap keh sakte hain ke main zameen se aaya hoon.

 Talking about his dancing which steered many a sleeper hit in the 1980s, Mithun says: I enjoy dancing. I have never learnt dancing. I have been a great fan of Elvis Presley and I picked up my pelvic moves from him. My dancing style is taken some from John Travolta, some from Michael Jackson, some from Elvis and I have added my Indianised touch to it and created my own style.

 The Lage Raho Mithunda film festival which started on MAX on Monday continues every evening at 5 pm till January 26. Catch Dance Dance, Commando, Mujrim, Boxer and Agneepath.

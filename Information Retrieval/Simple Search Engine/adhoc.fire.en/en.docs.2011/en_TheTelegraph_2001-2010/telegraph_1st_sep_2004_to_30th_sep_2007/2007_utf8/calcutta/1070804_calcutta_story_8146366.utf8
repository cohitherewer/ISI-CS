 Haul of fake handsets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fake mobile phone handsets of a leading brand, worth more than Rs 15 lakh, were recovered from a godown on Karl Marx Sarani by Enforcement Branch officers on Friday (picture on left of seized handsets by Pradip Sanyal). 

 The owner of the godown, Sheikh Jahangir, failed to produce papers for the handsets and was arrested.

 Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police and Enforcement Branch chief, said the phones were from China, where they were illegally manufactured.

 Officials of the company examined the sets and said that they were fakes, added Kumar.

 The Enforcement Branch acted on a tip-off that a consignment of fake mobile phones had reached the city. 

 Our initial effort was in vain, said an officer. The vital lead was obtained on Thursday night. 

 The value of the models in the market is more than Rs 12,000 each. Some of them cost as much as Rs 30,000, said Kumar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New-age signal, low-risk cigarette 

 Calcuttan of the Week

 Name: Pronab Kumar Mondal

 Claim to fame: Eleven inventions over the last 10 years to solve modern everyday problems. He has secured patents for all of them.

 The impetus: Pronab (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya) was born into a family that specialised in making electrical and mechanical goods. He studied commerce but left midway to help his fathers business. He was driven by the urge to create something of his own. In 1992, he came up with a battery-operated tricolour torch that can be used in the railways or defence for signalling. I was always keen on creating something that will raise the industrial profile of our country, says Pronab who owns a factory that manufactures automobile signalling equipment.

 His creations: A nicotine-free cigarette that poses a much lower health risk than those available in the market. An anti-pollution apparatus that makes vehicles smoke-free. An unbreakable material processed out of synthetic substances as an alternative to the round coloured glasses used for signalling in railways and aviation. A contraption that can act as a filter to trap polluted particles from factory chimney exhaust. 

 His latest brainchild: The model of a railway track and two trains spread out on the floor of his Dhakuria house. In 1997, Pronab began work on an automatic accident prevention device for electric, diesel or coal-driven trains, for which he has just got the patent. Installed both in the engine of a locomotive and the railway tracks, the device forces the train to stop if it senses the possibility of an accident within a distance of three kilometres. 

 Hopes and regrets: But Pronab is not a happy man. He is yet to find a taker for his inventions. Im still waiting for some venture capitalist to show interest, says Pronab hoping for the right hands to help him tide over his financial limitations. He will not start work on anything else till that happens.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bookie trio arrest tip of iceberg

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Not just cricket. Soccer and hockey matches, too, figured on the betting list of the racket busted in Salt Lake on Wednesday night.

 Interrogation of the three accused revealed that the racket had spread its reach much wider than what sleuths had anticipated. They would hold bets on any match be it a Calcutta football league clash or an international football or cricket match. Their agents operated in cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, said an officer.

 Adarsh Mohta and two associates Jitesh Khaitan and Dinesh Yadav also disclosed the names of a few more persons they claimed were involved in the syndicate. They live in the city or on the fringes. Mohta had been arrested eight months ago, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 The sleuths raided the ground floor of AC 70, from where the racket operated, once more on Friday and seized a laptop (two other laptops had been seized on Wednesday) and a file containing the names of several influential persons.

 A preliminary investigation has revealed that the local clientele of the syndicate comprises mostly promoters in the city and its adjoining areas.

 Mohta, a garments trader, had allegedly used his contacts in Burrabazar and Posta to rope in clients, said an investigating officer.

 We are yet to track down the links in Posta, but the Burrabazar agent has been identified. His job was to popularise the syndicate among the businessmen, the officer added.

 Mohta and his associates were arrested by a team from Bidhannagar (North) police station following a tip-off by a client who was allegedly cheated by the syndicate.

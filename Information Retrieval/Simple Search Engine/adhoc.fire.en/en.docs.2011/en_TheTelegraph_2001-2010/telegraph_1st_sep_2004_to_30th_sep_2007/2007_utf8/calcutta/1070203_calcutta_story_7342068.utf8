 Writers briefed on fair

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Members of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild met chief secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray at Writers Building on Friday and formally informed him about the venue and date of the 32nd Calcutta Book Fair.

 Book Fair 2007 will be held on the Salt Lake stadium grounds from February 10 to February 21. The fair will be inaugurated on February 9. 

 We have officially informed the government about the date and venue of the fair. We have also briefed him of the circumstances under which the fair was shifted out of the Maidan, said Guild general secretary Tridib Chatterjee.

 He added that the stalls would be smaller than last year. The seven-acre space we are getting at Yuva Bharati Krirangan is not a patch on the 28 acres on the Maidan. But we really dont have a choice. Money will be refunded to all stall-owners who would get smaller stalls than what they had been allotted in the initial plan.

 Chatterjee clarified that in case any publisher wanted to withdraw from the fair, the Guild will refund the money.

 The Guild has also informed the International Publishers Association about the high courts verdict disallowing the fair on the Maidan on environmental grounds.

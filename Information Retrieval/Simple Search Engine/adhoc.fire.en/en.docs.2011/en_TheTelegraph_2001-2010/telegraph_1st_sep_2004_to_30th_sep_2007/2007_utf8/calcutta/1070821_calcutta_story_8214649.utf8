 National eminence tag a salve for JU

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur University (JU) is set to be declared an Institute of National Eminence.

 The status, to be conferred by the Union human resources development ministry, will bring in regular central grants and a one-time assistance of Rs 682 crore for the university.

 JU is now entirely dependent on state funds.

 The status is likely to provide some solace to JU, which reportedly felt slighted after the Centre upgraded Bengal Engineering and Science University to the level of an Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology. The upgrade was in conformity with the recommendation of the Anandakrishnan Committee, set up by the Centre in 2005.

 The Centre had recently conveyed its decision on the issue to the university and asked it to send a proposal on how it wants to change its admission procedure and governance, once it gets the status.

 Vice-chancellor S.K. Sanyal wrote back to the Centre on Monday, detailing the proposed changes. We have pointed out what would be the mode of admission and governance, post-upgrade, said Sanyal.

 The university has said that instead of depending solely on the state joint entrance examination, as is the practice now, it would like to admit a number of students through tests conducted by the Centre, such as AIEEE and IIT-JEE.

 As for the mode of governance, it expressed its willingness to incorporate the necessary changes without disturbing the basic character of the present system running the institute through elected administrative bodies.

 We are ready to discuss the issues with the Union ministry. We are waiting for its reply, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the universitys executive council.

 Sanyal had written to the ministry in June, seeking to be told its stand on JUs upgrade. The university followed it up with a meeting with ministry officials in Delhi, where it was assured of the Institute of National Eminence status.

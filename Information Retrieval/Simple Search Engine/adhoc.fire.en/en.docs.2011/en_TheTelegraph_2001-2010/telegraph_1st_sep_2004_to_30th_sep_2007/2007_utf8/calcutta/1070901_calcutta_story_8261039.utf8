 Snag in IPTV roll-out

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), launched by BSNL on August 14, will not be available to subscribers for at least 15 more days.

 The third satellite television viewing option after CAS and DTH has hit a snag in the form of a technical clause.

 We have 56 channels out of the promised 100, including the STAR bouquet. We are yet to get into an agreement with Sony and Zee, said S.K. Chakraborty, the chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones.

 According to officials, Sony and Zee have raised questions on providing signals to BSNL under clause 5.6 in policy guidelines for downlinking of television channels (2005). The clause states that broadcasters shall provide satellite TV signal reception decoders only to MSOs or cable operators registered under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, or to a DTH operator registered under the DTH guidelines issued by the Centre. 

 IPTV was not conceived of at the time when the policy was framed, so there is no mention of it in the policy. The service should be available to customers in 15 days, said Chakraborty.

 Calcutta Telephones has applied for a cable licence that will make it eligible to receive signal reception decoders from the broadcasters.

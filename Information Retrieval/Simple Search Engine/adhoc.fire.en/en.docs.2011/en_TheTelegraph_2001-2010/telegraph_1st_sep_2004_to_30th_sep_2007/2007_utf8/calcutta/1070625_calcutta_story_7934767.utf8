 Mohammad Muslim cannot remember how he came to Arambagh. He also did not know how he would return to Nepal. But now, the 28-year-old is back with his wife and son in their Panchrukhi home, thanks to the efforts of an NGO. 

 Muslim has been suffering from schizophrenia since he was about six years old. Four years ago, he got lost on his way to a doctor with his father Rojid Mian. Muslim never took his medicines on time. That made things worse for him, Rojid Mian said. He searched for his son for three years and then took him to be dead.

 Later in 2003, Muslim was found in Arambagh and taken to court. He was then brought to Calcutta and admitted at Pavlov Hospital. Anjali, an NGO that works for the welfare of schizophrenics, started looking after him.

 Initially, Muslim did not respond to anything we asked. He would only talk to himself and we could not understand his language, said Ratnaboli Ray, founder and managing trustee of Anjali.

 The organisation made arrangements for Muslims return to Nepal. It needed a release order from the Arambagh court. We had to appeal to the court for over a year to secure Muslims release, said Rama Banerjee, a member of the NGO.

 A year ago, Anjali got in touch with Muslims father with the help of a Nepalese NGO. Rojid, whose family is in Nepal for three generations, was elated to know that his son was alive.

 Muslim, the eldest of five siblings, still cannot recollect how he came to Arambagh. But the dark, well-built man had not forgotten about his home. 

 I remember my mother. When I go back home, I will play with my brothers and sister, Muslim had said with a smile before leaving for Nepal.

 In the past four years, he has got addicted to television and enjoys Bollywood films. He has also grown fond of the members of Anjali. 

 I will call didi (Ratnaboli) after I reach Nepal, the young man had promised.

 The NGO has pronounced Muslim physically and mentally fit. He can work if he takes his medicines regularly, said an NGO member.

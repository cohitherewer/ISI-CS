 Killer wheels continued spilling blood on city roads, with two middle-aged men suffering critical injuries in two accidents on Thursday. 

 A speeding bus hit Rafiq Ahmed, 50, near the Park Street-AJC Bose Road crossing around 2pm, while Jugal Shaw, also 50, was hit by a private bus near Chiria More, on BT Road, earlier in the day. 

 Their fate, however, was different from that of Bejoy Dey, who was crushed to death by a speeding vehicle near Salt Lakes Nalban boating complex on Wednesday. The techie lay on the busy Nicco Park Road for over half an hour and cars zipped past him without caring to stop by for a second look at the body. 

 Seeing Rafiq lying bleeding near the AJC Bose Road-Park Street crossing, after a bus on route 3D/1 hit him from behind and its rear wheels rolled over his legs, traffic constable Moloy Dey intervened. 

 He was critical. I hailed a taxi and took him to Calcutta National Medical College and had him admitted in the emergency ward, said Dey. According to him, he did his job as a public servant. 

 Jugal, too, was lucky. Some bystanders took him to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Both Rafiq and Jugal were reported to be in a stable condition on Thursday night.

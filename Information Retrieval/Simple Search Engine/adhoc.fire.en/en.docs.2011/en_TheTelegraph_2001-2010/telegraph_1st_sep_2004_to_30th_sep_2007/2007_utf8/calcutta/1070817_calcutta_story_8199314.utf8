The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bitten by battery bug

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sara Mukherjee, a college student, is married to her mobile. Yet, all of Independence Day, she did not touch her Nokia handset. I did not even go near it, fearing that it would explode, she admitted.

 A dash to the Nokia service centre in Tollygunge on Thursday morning certified her set safe and so she was promptly back on her mobile.

 Debashis Das, a businessman from Bansdroni, was not that lucky. The same service centre gave his phone battery the thumbs down and said it must be replaced.

 But Das would have to wait for three days, as the demand for Nokia batteries is outpacing supply ever since the company issued a statement on Tuesday that a certain set of BL-5C batteries were prone to overheating and would be replaced.

 Nokia India director (marketing) Devinder Kishore said on Tuesday that customers need not go to any Nokia centre. One must run a self-check and if the battery is found to be from the faulty batch, it would be replaced and delivered home within 10 days.

 But on Thursday, every Nokia service centre that opened after I-Day was thronged by customers bitten by the battery bug. An official at the Nokia service centre on Bentinck Street said: I have never seen such a rush ever since mobile phones came to town. We are assuring them that the faulty batteries would overheat and not explode and that they can just run a check themselves, but they want an interface with man rather than machine.

 Of the 2,200 batteries checked at the Bentinck Street and Tollygunge centres till Thursday evening, 25 turned out to be manufactured by the Japanese company Matsushita, between December 2005 and November 2006, that would be replaced by Nokia.

 Also on Thursday, Malabika Dey of Beleghata reported that her non-Nokia cellphone battery had exploded last month, but the cause was not clear.

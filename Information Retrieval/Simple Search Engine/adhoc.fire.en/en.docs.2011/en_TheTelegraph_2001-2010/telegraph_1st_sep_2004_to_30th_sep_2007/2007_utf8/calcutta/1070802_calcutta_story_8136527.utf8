 JEE scam network widens

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Piyush Kanti Ghosh, who had taken Rs 50,000 from Deb Kumar Ghosh to admit his son Ramanuj at NRS Medical College, was an agent of medical entrance scam kingpins Mihir Kumar Jha and Ranvijay Pathak. 

 We have evidence that Piyush Kanti was working on behalf of Jha and Pathak. It could be that the two had fielded a dummy on behalf of Ramanuj in JEE 2007, but the plan did not work, said Ajoy Kumar, the city detective chief. Hence, Piyush Kanti asked for only Rs 50,000 to secure Ramanujs admission at NRS.

 According to police, Piyush Kanti, who claimed to be a doctor, is in his early 50s and lives in Sinthee. He had given Deb Kumar, a doctor, an identity card for Ramanuj with the forged signature of the NRS dean. Ramanuj was asked to take it along while meeting the college principal on July 30 for admission.

 Ramanuj had passed Higher Secondary in 2004 with 57 per cent marks.

 The police are looking for another agent named Montu, who used to operate in Lake Town and had a hand in bringing Avijit Saha to the racket. 

 A dummy had secured a rank of 131 for Saha in JEE 2007. He had taken admission at Medical College before his arrest.

 The chief minister on Wednesday expressed satisfaction with the progress of the JEE scam investigation.

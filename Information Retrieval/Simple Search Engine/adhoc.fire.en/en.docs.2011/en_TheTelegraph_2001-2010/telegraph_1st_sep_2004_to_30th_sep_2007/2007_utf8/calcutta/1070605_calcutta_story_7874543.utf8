 A rebel with a cause

 The New Wave (French: La Nouvelle Vague) was a blanket term coined by critics for a group of French filmmakers of the late 1950s and 1960s, influenced (in part) by Italian Neo-realism. Although never a formally organised movement, the New Wave filmmakers were linked by their self-conscious rejection of classical cinematic form and their spirit of youthful iconoclasm. Many were also engaged with the social and political upheavals of the era, making their radical experiments with editing, visual style and narrative part of a general break with the conservative paradigm. Along with Claude Chabrols Le Beau Serge, Jacques Rivettes first feature, Paris Nous Appartient (Paris Belongs to Us) kindled the flame that became known as the French New Wave. The films production began in the early summer of 1958 with money borrowed from the magazine Rivette worked for, Cahiers du Cinema. Technicians, actors, and lab fees were all on credit, with no money exchanged until the films release in 1960. Without so much as a car, Rivette and his entourage of film enthusiasts worked whenever they could, spending Sundays trying to raise enough money to begin filming again on Mondays. Featuring Chabrol as a mysterious figure in a caf who disseminates cryptic narrative information and flirts ineptly with a pretty girl, the film deals with a group of displaced bohemians searching for the meaning of life and hiding from a mysterious, never- explained menace. With the help of Chabrol and Truffaut, whose first films were already receiving acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival, Paris was finally released a stepping stone towards French cinemas rebirth. Hosted by The French Association.

 Event: Screening of French film Paris Nous Appartient When: Today at 6 pm Where: The French Association Library

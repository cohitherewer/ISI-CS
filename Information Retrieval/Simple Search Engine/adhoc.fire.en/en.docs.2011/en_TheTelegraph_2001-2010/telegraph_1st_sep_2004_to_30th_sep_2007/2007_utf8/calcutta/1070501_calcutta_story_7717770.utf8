 Art for social consciousness

 Putting in perspective the conflicting influences of the present age of consumerism, competition and corruption, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by a group of artists brings together a collection of imaginative, fascinating, evocative and, at times, cryptic images that also provide splendid viewing pleasure. Featuring works on a wide variety of themes including deception, self-love, temptation, loss of innocence and questioning of faith, it holds a mirror to contemporary artistic trends, emphasising the role of artists as defenders of human rights and champions of social reform. Participating artists: Ajoy Kumar Bandyopadhyay, Dipak Mukherjee, Dilip Banerjee, Kamalaksha Ganguly, Kiran Kumar Sen, Pramathes Chandra, Ratan Acharya, Subrata Gangopadhyay (Chau; picture right), Somnath Roy, Swati Roy, Siddhartha Sengupta and Shibani Sengupta.

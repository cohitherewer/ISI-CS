 Threat call after clean-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 State fire services minister Pratim Chatterjees clean-up act has been greeted with a threat call. 

 A day after he laid a trap and nabbed a corrupt officer in the fire protection department for taking a bribe, the minister was warned for his action. 

 Someone called me up on my mobile in the morning and threatened to kill me, said the minister, who convened a press conference on Thursday to tell the threat-call tale. 

 Apni saap niye khela korchen. Kajta bhalo karenni... Jibon jabe. (You are playing a snake. You have not done the right thing It will cost you your life), Chatterjee quoted the unknown caller as saying.

 According to him, the call can be linked to his efforts to counter corruption in his department. Following a complaint that some officers in his department were demanding money to issue fire safety licences, Chatterjee laid a trap. 

 Fire protection officer Suchidananda Mondal was caught red-handed while accepting a bribe from a licence applicant. Mondal was suspended from service on Wednesday. 

 I have not lodged any FIR Lets see what happens, said Chatterjee, adding that he has informed chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about the threat call. Bhattacharjee is reportedly happy with Chatterjees attempt at fighting corruption. 

 According to the minister, brokers involved in getting illegal licences by paying corrupt fire services officials are behind the threat call. He also named a person involved in the racket.

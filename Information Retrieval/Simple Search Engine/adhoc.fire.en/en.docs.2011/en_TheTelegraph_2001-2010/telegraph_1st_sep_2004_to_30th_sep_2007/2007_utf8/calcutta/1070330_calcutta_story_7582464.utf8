 Padma Rani Thakur lost her son Kamal to police brutality 26 years ago. 

 On Thursday, some men in uniform visited her Jagacha home, in Howrah, and handed over a cheque for Rs 5 lakh on a Calcutta High Court directive by way of compensation. 

 I was not after money. I just wanted to ensure that no mother loses her son as I did, said Padma Rani, tears rolling down her wrinkled cheeks.

 Holding the piece of paper in her frail hands, the 77-year-old said she wanted to spend this money on charity and her three sons nodded in approval. 

 Though the cheque marked a victory for the family fighting a legal battle since 1980 it also brought back memories of Kamal, an employee with the Indian Railways. 

 He was a very straightforward person and he had this streak in him to oppose criminal activities On the night of February 26, 1980, officers from Golabari police station picked him up on charges of raiding a local shop, recounted Shyamal, his younger brother. 

 According to the family, police detained him to teach him a lesson, as Kamal had raised his voice against anti-social activities in the area. 

 Next day, his body was found lying in front of Howrah General Hospital, Shyamal stopped to take a deep breath. 

 It was a shock, but our father (Sailendra Nath Thakur) resolved to seek justice and we moved court, added Shyamal. 

 In 1990, Calcutta High Court convicted three officers, including the then inspector-in-charge of Golabari police station, for the accidental death of Kamal in custody.

 Our father wanted to fight till the end and he died just two weeks after the judgment, recounted Gora, the youngest of Padma Ranis five sons.

 A few days later, the state government moved the Supreme Court, but the high court judgment was upheld with minor alterations in imprisonment terms. 

 Thirteen years after the first legal victory, the family moved court again for compensation. quot;We were not happy with the light punishment for the guilty Besides, we wanted to highlight our plight and send out a message against police atrocity, quot; explained Gora, while his mother stared at Kamals picture. 

 In 2003, holding the police responsible for her sons untimely death, Padma Rani moved the high court for a compensation of Rs 35 lakh from the state government. 

 After three years of legal battle, the court pronounced a landmark judgment last June and asked the government to pay Rs 5 lakh to Padma Rani as quot;balm on her wounds quot; and Rs 10,000 to cover the litigation costs. 

 quot;The judgment leaves the door open for fresh legal proceedings to demand more from the government, quot; said Gora, ruing the delay in payment of compensation. quot;The court had asked to pay compensation in a month, but we got it after six months. quot;

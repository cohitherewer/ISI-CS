 Remembrance of castles enchanted

 Mukul at home: An illustration from the credits of the film Shonar Kella

 There are houses we live in now, and there are remembered houses. The entire story of Rays Shonar Kella is a childs obsessive attempt to recover, through pictures and stories, a lost house. This is deeply puzzling to the grown-ups around him because the house happens to go back to a point in time that he couldnt have known. 

 Pheluda a diehard rationalist refuses to go into whether or not such a regression into a past life is possible. He simply accepts the truth of Mukuls feelings for this lost, improbably distant time. So, one of the most memorable scenes in the film is the one in which Mukul weeps alone among the ruins of his remembered home and neighbourhood. For him, being allowed to express this grief for something that seems to have been lost forever becomes a way of curing his disorienting break with the present. He can now go back home to the here and now. That this debris of a house is part of a magnificent golden fortress makes the end of his quest all the more poignant. Memories are rock-solid and magically, enduringly valuable. Yet they are also made up of vanished things and people. 

 Many of the wonderful stories and memoirs that Ray and his aunt, Leela Majumdar, wrote for young readers have in them the magic and fun and sadness of great, old houses. Rays grandfathers house 100 Gorpar Road was not just the residence of a large, various and versatile family, but a printing press and publishing house as well. Satyajit and Leela both remember the constant din of the press and the smell of printers ink. This was a house in which books and pictures were actually made, so that the thrill and fun of writing and illustrating, for both of them, also lay in the excitement of being part of the physical processes of printing and bookmaking. 

 For the modern, nucleated, latch-key generations, it is impossible to imagine the teeming, porous openness, generosity and madness of these houses, the extent to which they freed domestic life into a constant traffic of unforgettable people. The Home became the World. And everybody from distinguished visitors (like Rabindranath) to the humblest servant or tradesman became part of a perpetual human circus that provided both education and entertainment. Each adult member of the family was an eccentric who brought into the house his or her own universe of interests and oddness. The children grew up in it not only with literary novelty and variety, but also with an extraordinary range of human experiences from batty literary evenings to tragic, untimely deaths that made everything they later wrote rich with human observation, hilarity and empathy. 

 Yet, a series of deaths, followed by inadequate business management and eventual bankruptcy proved this great house ephemeral. Every bit of what was within was dismantled and auctioned away, and its inhabitants got dispersed into other, lesser, homes. In front of our eyes, writes Leela Majumdar in Pakdondi, the enchanted castle broke down and crumbled into rubble and dust. Human beings and animals go away or die, things get lost (and are occasionally found again), and beloved houses sometimes have to be abandoned. To face these truths finely, but without self-pity, is what many of her stories inspire, in the young and old alike. Hence her stories are full of ghosts, too delightful to be really frightening, who cant help touching the lives of those for whom the present becomes most fantastically real only when it is graced by the pastness of the past.

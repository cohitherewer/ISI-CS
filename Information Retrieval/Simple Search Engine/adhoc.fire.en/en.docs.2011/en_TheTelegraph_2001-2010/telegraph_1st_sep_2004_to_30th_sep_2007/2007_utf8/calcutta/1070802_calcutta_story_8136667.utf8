 The parents of students denied entry into Cossipore English School and Kendriya Vidyalaya (Cossipore) obstructed the busy Dum Dum Road on Wednesday morning for nearly two hours. 

 The agitation started when the security officials of the Gun and Shell Factory, whose campus houses the schools, prevented the guardians from entering the factory premises following a decision taken by the top brass of the regional office of the Ordnance Factory Board, Calcutta.

 The roadblock was, however, lifted after officers of Chitpur police station assured the guardians that they would hold a discussion with the Ordnance Factory Board.

 Amar Roy, the security officer of the factory, said that the decision had been taken for security reasons. The factory campus is a prohibited area and many guardians are seen loitering there, for which we were forced to take such a decision,he said.

 We came here to drop our children off as usual but when we tried to enter the premises, the security officials stopped us, complained Sruti Ghosh, a guardian. 

 Earlier, the distance to be traversed was nearly 200 metres from the main gate to the school campus, which is located at the rear of the premises. But now, following the ban, we have to walk nearly a kilometre either through Northern Avenue or Harekrishna Sett Lane, said Sudhanshu Tarafder, another guardian.

 According to the guardians, transport facilities are scarce on both sides of the two roads and they have no option but to walk. The road leading to the school from Northern Avenue is too narrow to let the school bus reach the school gate, so is the other way. 

 The roads often remain waterlogged and we have to wade through dirty water, said another guardian. 

 The car pool drivers, too, say they will face inconvenience because of the ban. The road is so narrow that it is difficult for two vehicles to pass through at the same time. We will face lot of difficulty parking our vehicles here, said Sanjay Das, a car pool driver. 

 The authorities of both schools pleaded helplessness in the matter. The decision has been taken by the Ordnance Factory Board authorities and there is nothing that we can do, as the entire thing is taking place beyond our school premises, said M.C. Prasad, the vice-principal of the Kendriya Vidyalaya unit. 

 J. Bajpei, the headmistress of Cossipore English School, echoed his view. 

 K.G. Gupta, the general manager of the Ordnance Factory Board, however, refused to comment and the secretary of the board was unavailable for comment.

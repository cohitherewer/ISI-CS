 Three youths were arrested on Wednesday in connection with the theft at a Shiva temple on Bagmari Road, in north Calcutta, late on Monday. The stolen items ornaments and accessories worth Rs 1 lakh are yet to be recovered.

 Of the three held, police suspect Sambhu Malakar, a local youth, had masterminded the theft. He and his accomplices, Jhantu Biswas and Badal Basak of Muraripukur Road, were interrogated at Maniktala thana.

 Malakar is a local resident. He was aware of the temple timings and other details. He roped in the two other youths and carried out the theft in a planned way. We hope to pick up some leads soon and recover the booty in a few days, said a senior officer at Maniktala police station.

 According to police, Malakar and his friends first tried to enter the temple through the main gate but could not break the locks.

 They then broke the rear gate, entered the shrine and walked away with a three-kg silver snake, a silver throne, and a nose, eyes and a bindi all gold along with other accessories and some cash.

 The temple committee members are hopeful of getting the jewellery and accessories back. The silver snake was once stolen around 30 years ago, but a man recovered it from an adjacent pond within two days. This time, too, we think God will help us out, smiled Subir Kumar Mondal, a temple committee member.

 The local residents have lined up a few witnesses, including a guard at a gurdwara nearby, who had spotted Malakar around the temple on Monday night. If needed, we will present these witnesses in court to strengthen our case, said a local youth.

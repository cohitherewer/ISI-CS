 Pinki Haldars smile told a story on Sunday, when she tied the knot with Sumanto Sarkar at Balia, Garia. Both are differently-abled in speech and hearing and wouldnt have come together had it not been for the support of their neighbours. 

 Pinki, 21, helps with the embroidery and needlework in a small tailoring shop at Balia, while the groom is an electricians help.

 Said Biswanath Haldar, father of Pinki and a rickshaw-puller by profession: Pinki is the eldest of my three daughters. Though I was elated when Sumantas family approached us with the proposal, I was at my wits end when I thought of the expenses the marriage would incur.

 This was where the neighbours at Barabadamtala, Garia, stepped in to raise money and host the wedding with their labour and efforts.

 Goutam Sen Gupta, a neighbour, explained: It feels nice to be of some help to the couple, especially for the bride. We have seen Pinki grow up. We just had to do something.

 Rahman Sarkar, one of the many excited over the marriage, said: All the residents of this area were generous in making their contributions. The catering for the wedding is free. The decorators, too, are not charging us anything. 

 About 300 people attended the wedding with gifts and best wishes for the couple to start a life together.

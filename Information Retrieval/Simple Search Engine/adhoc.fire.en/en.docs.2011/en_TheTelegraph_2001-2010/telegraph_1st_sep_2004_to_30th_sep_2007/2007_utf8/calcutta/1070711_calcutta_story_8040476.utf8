The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flights to Germany daily in 2008

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta will have daily flights to Frankfurt from next year. 

 Lufthansa German Airlines, which operates thrice a week between Calcutta and Frankfurt, will increase the number of flights by next year. All other airports in India that we operate from have daily flights to Frankfurt. Calcutta, too, will have daily flights soon, said Werner Heesen, the director (south Asia) of Lufthansa.

 The German and Indian governments are discussing additional landing rights for the airline from next year. Currently, Lufthansa operates 45 flights from six destinations in India to Frankfurt and Munich. Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad have daily flights to Frankfurt. New Delhi has daily flights to Frankfurt and also Munich.

 With the West-bound traffic from Calcutta growing at the rate of 15 per cent per year, more flights will be required to accommodate passengers in the near future, said aviation industry insiders. 

 A Lufthansa official said the airline has an average of 80 per cent passenger load from Calcutta. It operates Airbus A-330 aircraft with passenger capacities varying between 220 and 250. Most fly to Germany for work. Tourists comprise a small percentage, the official added.

 According to tour operators, despite strong competition from southeast Asia, the demand for flights to Europe is increasing among tourists. Direct connectivity, attractive fares and search for new destinations are the primary factors behind increase in number of tourists.

 The connectivity between Calcutta and Europe has increased after introduction of the Lufthansa flights. This has created a new segment of tourists from this part of the country, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India. 

 With India contributing less than 0.1 per cent to the worlds air traffic, Heesen feels there is a potential for growth. To attract passengers, the airline has introduced new services, such as Bengali cuisine on board.

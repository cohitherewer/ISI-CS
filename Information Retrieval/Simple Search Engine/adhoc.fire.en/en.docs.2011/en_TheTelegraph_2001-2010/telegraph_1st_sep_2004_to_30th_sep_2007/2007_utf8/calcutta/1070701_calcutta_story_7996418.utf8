 Corporate stage for theatre revival

 - Platform for experimentation

 The tide is definitely turning for theatre in Bengal with corporates vying for recognition as its prime promoter. Two festivals are barely over and Hutch Odeon is already colouring the town pink.

 Over 300 people, including celebrities from stage and screen, assembled at The Park on Friday to attend the inauguration of the seventh edition of the festival (June 30-July8), to be hosted by actress Gargi Roy Chowdhury.

 From tiny handouts shaped like masks of Comedy and Tragedy to the baul music that played as the laden platters and glittering glasses were emptied, everything announced that the days of roughing it out were over for Bengali theatre.

 Sponsoring six productions, of which two are from Mumbai, and a host of folk dance and song items, Hutch Odeon is certainly extending its scope. True, countless theatre practitioners like Badal Sircars Satabdi continue to work with no publicity and financial aid, but for many others festivals provide a means for experimentation. While a few complained that the selection process makes for the beginnings of a new kind of theatre corporate theatre the majority is happy. 

 The problem of selection and presentation came to the fore with the audio-visual presentation Theatre in Bengal: After Independence, scripted by Shamik Bandyopadhyay and conceptualised by Sohag Sen for the inauguration. With only 45 minutes in hand and a collection of guests with varying levels of interest in theatre, one can hardly expect a comprehensive history of Bengali theatre, and Bandyopadhyay was not claiming anything of the sort.

 The script that was read out with finesse by Dhritiman Chatterjee and Anashua Majumdar, was, according to Bandyopadhyay, the best memories of theatre he has watched since 1952. But while one appreciated the collection of rare stills by Nemai Ghosh, the theatre songs and was roused by Dhritimans reading from Utpal Dutts Dushswapner Nagari, one wondered why the study of trends stopped once it had reached Manoj Mitra, Badal Sircar and Mohit Chattopadhyay.

 These are dramatists and directors who are presenting fresh plays each year and the newest batch of directors like Bratya Basu, Suman Mukhopadhyay and Koushik Sen are continuing to introduce more elements into Bengali theatre. Isnt the local theatre scene still bubbling with possibilities and daring? Though few question Ketaki Duttas merit and dedication, the tribute to her seemed a sad way to conclude the presentation.

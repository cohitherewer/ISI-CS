 Entrance test focus in curricula revamp 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 From syllabi to examination system, the ICSE and ISC curricula is ready for a revamp.

 The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, which conducts the ICSE and ISC, plans to introduce the new curricula from 2010.

 The extensive exercise that was started by the council authorities last year to review the ICSE and ISC syllabi and examination system is nearing completion. The schools are expected to implement the new curricula in 2010, said Ranjan Mitter, the principal of Future Foundation school and member of the councils standing committee on examinations.

 One of the main objectives of the exercise is to upgrade the curricula so that students of over 1,400 schools affiliated to the council in India more than 100 of which are in the city proper can prepare for all-India entrance examinations and the school-leaving examination simultaneously.

 The syllabi will be brought on a par with those followed by boards that conduct all-India entrance examinations like the IIT-JEE for admission to engineering and medical institutes of the country. 

 There will also be an effort to make the ICSE and ISC syllabi on a par with the syllabi of the CBSE, state boards and international examinations.

 The blueprint is being prepared for a year and is expected to be ready by 2007-end.

 Syllabus revision is a continuous process and the council has always updated the syllabi whenever necessary. But the current exercise is different. The changes will be brought in after extensive research so that they have a far-reaching effect, said a council official. The opinions of the people associated with education are being considered.

 A large number principals of ICSE and ISC schools and educationists are part of the process, added the official. 

 Inputs from the principals prompted the council move. Heads of many ICSE schools had pointed out that since the current ICSE and ISC syllabi are not in tune with those for all-India entrance examinations, students wanting to appear in them often felt burdened.

 Students studying in schools affiliated to the CBSE enjoy an advantage in most all-India entrance tests as they follow the boards syllabi.

 The principals of ICSE-ISC schools feel that their students are struggling to compete with their counterparts in CBSE schools.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shell out more to buy a flat

 - Additional stamp duty of one per cent will push up home prices

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Get ready to shell out Rs 25,000 to Rs 3 lakh more for your dream home.

 State finance minister Asim Dasgupta on Friday slapped an additional stamp duty charged on transfer of property of one per cent on flats or houses exceeding a market value of Rs 25 lakh.

 With real estate prices moving northwards, a standard flat in an apartment block costs anything between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 3 crore (at high-end addresses). So, a one per cent increase in stamp duty from the existing six per cent will raise the price of flats. 

 We can expect someone paying in excess of Rs 25 lakh to bear the additional burden, Bengal Shrachi managing director Rahul Todi told Metro. But some buyers might postpone the registration process to arrange for additional funds, he felt.

 Not everyone in the world of realty growing at breakneck pace in Calcutta is as hopeful. Some said the additional duty would be a bitter pill for consumers seeking home sweet homes in the city.

 It is a lose-lose situation for the purchaser. First, he is paying a high interest rate on housing loan and then paying one per cent extra on stamp duty, observed Santosh Rungta of Credai, the apex body of real estate developers.

 The realty lobby was, in fact, awaiting a slash of the duty to five per cent, which would have met the condition laid down by the National Urban Renewal Mission Fund and given a fillip to the industry. Even the lower limit of Rs 25 lakh could have been raised, suggested Abhijit Das of property consultants Trammel Crow Meghraj.

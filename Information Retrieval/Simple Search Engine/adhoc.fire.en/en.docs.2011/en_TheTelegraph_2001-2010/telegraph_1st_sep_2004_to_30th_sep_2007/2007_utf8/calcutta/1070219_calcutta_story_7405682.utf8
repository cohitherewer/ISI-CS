 What is common to Sourav Ganguly, John Abraham and Bipasha Basu? High fitness level and lithe physique, thanks to hours of kickboxing. 

 If you, too, want to burn 350 to 400 calories in a short time and boost strength, flexibility and reflexes, head for Calcutta Judo Club, on Mayo Road. The Kickboxing Association of West Bengal is conducting classes there every Thursday and Sunday for those who want to pursue the sport for fitness reasons. The focus is on cardio-kickboxing,with a lot of general exercises, stretches and fight stunts for self-defence thrown in. 

 Many people think that kickboxing, being a branch of martial arts, involves combat. But the best part is that the sport provides a full body workout without a fight. That is why it is gaining in popularity among people who lead sedentary lives and have very little time to devote to fitness, says sensei Montu Das, founder and general secretary of the association. 

 Kickboxing involves a variety of punches, kicks, knee strikes and other self-defence moves performed while bouncing on the ground. When Sourav Ganguly was trying to make a comeback into Team India, he took the help of Das for two months to improve reflexes and agility.

 Kickboxing provides a high-impact cardiovascular workout, bringing together elements of boxing, martial arts and aerobics into a 30-60 minute routine. Unlike boxing, one can use the feet to kick and punch, explains Das. The growing popularity of the sport can be gauged from the fact that many schools and colleges are providing kickboxing training as an extra-curricular activity. Das teaches the sport at MP Birla and Sunrise schools and Marine Engineering College.

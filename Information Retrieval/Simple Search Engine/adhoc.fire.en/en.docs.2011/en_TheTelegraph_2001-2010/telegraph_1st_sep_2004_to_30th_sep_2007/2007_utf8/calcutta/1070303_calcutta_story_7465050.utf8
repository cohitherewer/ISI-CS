The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gallons in pipeline

 - Technology and capacity upgrade 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority, a sister concern of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), is taking up a series of projects to ease the water supply problems in various areas.

 The schemes include augmenting the capacity of the Padmapukur Water Treatment Plant, in Howrah, from 30 to 60 million gallons and increasing the supply of water from Garden Reach Waterworks to Jadavpur and Behala from 30 to 60 million gallons a day.

 There is also a plan to set up a water treatment plant in Kalyani with a capacity of 30 million gallons. The three schemes will cost around Rs 25 crore.

 The schemes were finalised at a recent meeting chaired by urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who also heads the CMDA.

 The augmentation of the Howrah water treatment plant, at an investment of Rs 9 crore, will benefit residents of several pockets in the town that is passing through a water crisis, said a CMDA official.

 The department will spend around Rs 2 crore to boost water supply from Garden Reach to Jadavpur and Behala through technology upgrade and a reservoir capacity hike.

 The Kalyani project, which calls for an investment of Rs 14 crore, will be executed on a turnkey basis. All aspects of the project designing, construction, trial run and commissioning will be outsourced.

 Work will start in April, said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar. Funds will not be a problem, as the allocations were made in the previous budget.

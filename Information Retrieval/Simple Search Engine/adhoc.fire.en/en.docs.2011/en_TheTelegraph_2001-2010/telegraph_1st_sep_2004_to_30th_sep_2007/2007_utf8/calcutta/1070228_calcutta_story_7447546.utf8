 From whether Team India can score 300-plus to whether Sensex can scale up to 14,500-mark the ball game in the citys betting paradise has changed in the run-up to the Union Budget. 

 As the market tumbled yet again, with the Sensex shedding 130 points and closing 13,478.83, bookmakers in Sonapatti got busy giving rates on the impact of P. Chidambarams budget speech on the 30-stock index. 

 The odds are stacked at 83 paisa for every rupee, if the Sensex touches the 14,500 mark on Wednesday. It means, anybody placing a bet of Re 1 on the Sensex crossing the 14,500 mark can earn Rs 1.83. 

 People are placing bets, but it can not be compared with the enthusiasm around cricket matches But as it is boom time in the capital market, a lot of punters and market operators are placing bets, said a bookmaker, sitting in his gaddi in Posta. 

 The bookmakers admit that betting on budget is not as lucrative as cricket, but still they get in touch with their Mumbai counterparts and announce rates due to lower risk factor. The odds are given out on information received from various sources in the ministry of finance. Once we get the odds from bookies in Mumbai, we start giving them out to interested parties, explained another bookie. 

 As the Budget is not only about the bull run in the bourses, bookmakers are offering rates on a host of other likely announcements on personal income-tax structure and duties on consumer durable products. 

 Placing bets before the Union Budget is common, but the volume of transaction is growing, added the bookie, in between reading out rates on phone lines. 

 Unlike cricket matches, he has not gone into hiding before B-Day because he is aware that the surveillance from police will be loose on Wednesday. 

 But police promise to be on the prowl to curb illegal placing of bets. We are aware of the trend We will take appropriate action, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 College status on hold

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A state government committee has recommended against granting complete autonomy to Presidency College, though it wants the institution to enjoy more freedom in academic matters.

 The panel was set up to study the proposal for an upgrade of the status of the college. It has suggested that the college continue to enjoy autonomy in running postgraduate courses and be given certain liberties in running undergraduate courses. 

 But Presidency being a college fully controlled and aided by the state, autonomy on the St Xaviers model has not been considered for it. The college should not be allowed to be delinked from Calcutta University. Nor can it be accorded deemed university status, said a source close to the committee.

 The panel has examined all aspects of the proposal.... It is up to the government to decide on the ideal status for the college, said committee chairman Subimal Sen. The report was handed over to the government on Wednesday.

 St Xaviers was granted autonomy in July last year. Presidency was among the colleges shortlisted for the autonomy tag in the second phase.

 The government has recently cleared the autonomy path for RK Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, and RK Mission Sikshanmandir, Belur.

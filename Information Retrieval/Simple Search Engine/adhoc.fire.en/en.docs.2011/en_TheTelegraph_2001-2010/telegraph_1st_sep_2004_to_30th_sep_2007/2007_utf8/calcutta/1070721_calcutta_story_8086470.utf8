 A 27-year-old homemaker was stabbed to death by her lover at Teghoria on Friday morning, after she refused to sever ties with her family and settle down with him. Chhaya Mitra died in a government hospital after a local nursing home refused to admit her.

 We arrested the womans lover, Anup Roy, 37, on the charge of murder. He works as a mechanic in a garage at Dum Dum and used to live there, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.

 Chhaya lived with her husband and two daughters, aged four and six, in a rented house at Ashwininagar, near Baguiati. She was a Group-D employee in a Montessori school near Teghoria. Her two sisters also work in the school in the same capacity.

 Around 7.30am on Friday, Chhaya was walking to school after getting off a bus on VIP Road. Anup followed her. As she entered the schools lane, he pounced on her with a kitchen knife and stabbed her several times, said Saheb Ali Khan, the taxi driver who took the bleeding woman to a nursing home in the neighbourhood. Chhayas sister Bina and the schools gatekeeper, Kamlesh Singh, accompanied them.

 After being refused admission, Chhaya was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where she died. 

 Anup stabbed Chhaya a few yards from the school. The owner of a tea stall and a few local residents tried to catch him, but he scared everyone away with his knife. The locals caught him when he fell down, said Neelakshi Shukla, the principal of the Montessori.

 According to the police, Anup and Chhaya came close two years ago. Her husband Swapan is a conductor on a bus on route 44. Anup had asked Chhaya to move out of her home and settle down with him early this week, said an officer of Baguiati police station.

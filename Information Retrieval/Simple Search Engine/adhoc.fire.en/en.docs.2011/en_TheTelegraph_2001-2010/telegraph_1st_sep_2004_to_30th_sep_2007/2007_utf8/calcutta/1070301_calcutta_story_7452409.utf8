 Looking back on Kieslowski

 As tribute to celebrated Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski, Cine Central, Calcutta presents a retrospective of his best-known films. To be screened today are Personnel and Decalogue (at 4 pm) and From the City of Lodz and Blind Chance (at 6.30 pm). Decalogue, a series of 10 short films set in a Warsaw tower block, each nominally based on one of the Ten Commandments, is considered one of the most critically-acclaimed film cycles of all time. Blind Chance (a scene from the film appears right) begins with mysteries in the life of Witek, its protagonist, and then resolves these initially confusing and isolated fragments one by one into the story of a mans life. Focusing on the ethical choices made by its central character, the film exploits Kieslowskis skill in setting up comparisons, ironies and unexpected connections to the fullest.

 Event: Retrospective of the films of Krzysztof Kieslowski When: March 1,2, 4 amp; 5 Where: Nandan II

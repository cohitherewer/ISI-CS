 HS asked for ideal answers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A Calcutta High Court judge on Friday re-examined the answer scripts of three students who had failed to clear Higher Secondary (HS) 2007 but secured ranks in the joint entrance examination. 

 Justice Biswanath Somadder directed the HS council to provide the ideal answers to the questions he had earmarked in the answer scripts.

 The judge had asked the students to bring their science textbooks to the court on Friday. He tallied the answers in the scripts with the information in the textbooks, before asking for the ideal answers.

 Let the council come with the ideal answers to the questions I have earmarked. Then I will decide the future course of action, Justice Somadder told the councils advocate.

 The three students, Madhurima Mukherjee, Debalina Banerjee and Dipanwita Barua, had appeared in the board examination from the same college in Asansol and had failed in the science subjects. They moved the high court, seeking an order asking the council to produce the answer scripts before the court.

 The judge had granted the students prayer. The council had produced the answer scripts of Madhurima and Debalina last Friday. The judge had gone through the answers and asked Madhurima and Debalina a few questions.

 This is the first time a high court judge re-examined HS answer scripts, said a senior advocate.

 The council had filed an appeal before the division bench, challenging an order by Justice Somadder asking the council to constitute a committee of examiners to re-assess the answer scripts. The appeal is pending before the division bench, headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar.

 Justice Somadder wants to know whether the council-appointed examiners evaluated the scripts properly or not, said a high court advocate.

 Check for waterlogging

 - Sewer revamp to redress bane of low-lying areas

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has taken up a 

 Rs 30-lakh sewer revamp scheme to redress the problem of waterlogging in pockets on the eastern fringes of the city.

 Civic officials said more than 1.75 lakh people living in the East Ballygunge Place areas of Picnic Garden Road, Natore Park, Kustia Road, Bondel Gate and Rifle Range Road will benefit from the project.

 It is one of the several sewer revamp schemes taken up by the CMC, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. Those areas have been brought under the schemes where the duration of waterlogging can be minimised through technical intervention and proper upkeep of the drainage system.

 For a permanent solution, he pointed out, the residents of the low-lying areas will have to wait for the completion of Rs 1,245-crore drainage and sewerage projects taken up with financial aid from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

 Run-off water from the eastern fringes flow into the outflow channels through a network of drains and Tollygunge-Panchannagram channel. The capacity of both the channel and the drains have been severely reduced because of silt. 

 The ADB schemes, under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, aim to clear the silt and restore the drains to their original water-bearing capacity.

 The Rs 30-lakh CMC project being undertaken by the centralised drainage and sewerage department and also the engineering wing of Borough VII will include revamping the concrete drains, increasing the diameter of sewer lines, desilting and creating more manholes.

 Civic deputy chief engineer (civil) P.K. Dhua explained that the East Ballygunge Place area is prone to waterlogging, as it is on the downside of the south-eastern slope of the city. 

 The elevated railway tracks of the Sealdah South section, running along the north-western part of the area, and the EM Bypass on the south-east have aggravated the problem.

 The other areas where similar sewer revamp schemes have been undertaken include CR Avenue-Mahajati Sadan, Ballygunge Phari, Free School Street, Kasba Bakultala, Harish Mukherjee Road, Golf Green and pockets close to CR Avenue.

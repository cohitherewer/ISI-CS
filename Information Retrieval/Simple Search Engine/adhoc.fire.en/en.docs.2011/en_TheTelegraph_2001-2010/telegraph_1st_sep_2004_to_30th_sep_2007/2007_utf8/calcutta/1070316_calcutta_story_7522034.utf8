 Wednesdays tragedy in Nandigram has changed the bandh blather in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal. Not only was the standard beat the bandh chant muffled, the usual flurry of activity to ensure a normal working day from Writers Buildings to Sector V was missing ahead of Fridays state-wide shutdown.

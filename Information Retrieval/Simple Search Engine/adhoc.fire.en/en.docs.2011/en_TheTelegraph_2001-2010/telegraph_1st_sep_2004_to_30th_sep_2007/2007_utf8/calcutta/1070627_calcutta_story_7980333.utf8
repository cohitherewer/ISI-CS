The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Tobey Maguire

 You are a shy, sensitive and deeply private person. Reliable, honest and fair, you quickly gain the respect of co-workers. You are multi-talented and, as long as you stay focused, you deliver. You are very determined and never rest till your project is completed.

 You are tolerant of others weaknesses.

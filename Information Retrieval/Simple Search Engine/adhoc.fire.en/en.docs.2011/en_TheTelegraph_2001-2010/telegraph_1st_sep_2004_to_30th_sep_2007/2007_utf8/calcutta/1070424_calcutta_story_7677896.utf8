 The city street lights are proving inadequate for motorists because of heavy smog in the evening.

 The problem has assumed such proportions that the state government has sought help from the electrical engineering department of Jadavpur University. The department is working on a solution.

 As a first step, students of the department conducted a study on how street lighting is being affected by air pollution. The study was conducted on Red Road last week.

 The study, believed to be the first of its kind in India, will be used to analyse the street lighting problem and work out remedies.

 We are focused on understanding the problem and taking steps to sort it out. Once the study is completed, we will develop a software which will provide a guideline on standard lighting arrangements for city roads, said Biswanath Roy, reader of the universitys illumination engineering wing. He is overseeing the project.

 Elaborating on the methodology, Roy said a team of students measured the illumination provided by street lights on Red Road from 6 pm to 2 am.

 We selected the stretch because it is considered the ideal thoroughfare. We found the illumination was not adequate during the peak hours from 6 pm to 9 pm when the air pollution level was the highest. The situation improved at night due to a boost in voltage and less auto emission, added Roy.

 Those conducting the study, supported by the public works department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, have divided the city roads into four categories.

 Our software will suggest the kind of street lighting required for each category. For example, Red Road and Surya Sen Street do not require the same type of street lighting, said Roy.

 Our primary suggestion will be on the minimum gap between two lamp posts. If two posts are not close enough, there will be dark patches on the road. If our recommendations are followed, motorists will be able to drive down roads after dark without switching on their headlights.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim stressed the importance of street lighting in traffic management.

 We hope the study will be of help to the police and motorists, and the number of road mishaps at night will decrease, stated the deputy commissioner.

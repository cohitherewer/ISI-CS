 Antique textiles, some around 200 years old, are the focus of this years Art in Life exhibition at CIMA Gallery. The annual show, that started on Friday and will be on till October 17, is a collection of handpicked objects of beauty and utility, procured straight from craftspeople around the country.

 In the year that Durga is to arrive in a dola (palanquin), palki covers embroidered and applique are some of the star attractions of the show. Also on display are rare Bhutanese shawls, woven in intricate geometric patterns.

 The wedding shawls, torans and wall hangings from Saurashtra, Kutch and Bikaner, between 80 and 200 years old, bear hand-embroidery combining unusual motifs a gramophone juxtaposed with a lion, playing card-styled kings and queens sitting beside Ganesha.

 Artists love seeing these pieces because there is such a whimsy to them, and yet there is order, says Pratiti Basu Sarkar, chief administrator, CIMA Gallery.

 An intricate creation is a 200-year-old wedding shawl from Bikaner, in which the traditional bandhni dots have been created not with tie-and-dye, but with painstakingly executed embroidery.

 While the prices of these heirloom pieces go up to Rs 62,000, the more casual shopper has a lot to choose from at the exhibition, now in its fifth year.

 Take a look at an interesting innovation in the form of T-shirts hand-painted by a patachitrakar. The designs are of her own choosing but the traditional vegetable dyes had to be sacrificed for fabric paints.

 With a kantha overkill all round, CIMA has gone back to the roots of the rustic craft. To go back to the tradition of using kantha as swaddling clothes, we had our ladies layer white muslin, which is soft, like old saris. These could be used as dupattas, but really are meant to be used as blankets, explains Pratiti Basu Sarkar.

 Another eye-catcher is a mosaic table from north India, which bears resemblance to Byzantine Empire tile art. A Gujarati dowry chest in wood and brass not only looks beautiful, but has been built to thwart any attempts at theft, with its complex internal locking mechanism.

 There is a large display of dokra from Bastar and Bengal, and some striking tribal masks from North Dinajpur. There is a wide selection of wall hangings, carpets, dhurries, bedsheets, cushion covers, stoles, dupattas, bags and jewellery. Stationery and books complete the collection.

 Man in uniform robs duo

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A criminal in police uniform and his two partners robbed a porter and a teenaged trader at Howrahs Pilkhana on Wednesday, using women as bait.

 Kamal Haldar, 26, who works in Mangalar Haat, in Howrah, and Afroz, the 18-year-old trader from Metiabruz, met Guria, 30, and two other women in the market about a fortnight ago. On Wednesday afternoon, Guria telephoned the two and requested them to meet her at Pilkhana.

 Guria and the other two women, aged about 30 and 17, took the young men to a room on the third floor of a four-storeyed building at Mollapara. They offered us drinks. As they were preparing the drinks for us, three men, one of them in police uniform, entered the room and started beating us. They threatened to arrest us if we failed to give them Rs 10,000.

 Kamal and Afroz together had Rs 2,400 on them. Kamal rang up a friend and arranged for Rs 5,000. They handed over the money to the men. They also took away their cellphones and asked them to get in touch with Golabari police station the next day.

 Accordingly, the two went to the thana on Thursday, but could not find the three men.

 Sanjib Dutta, the inspector in charge of the police station, said the case was being probed.

 Fund for needy as school turns 50

 A STAFF REPORTER

To mark the golden jubilee of its formation next year, the Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Narendrapur, has decided to create a permanent fund for providing financial assistance to needy ex-students and retired staff.

 The fund will also provide retirement and medical benefits to employees of the institutions hostel.

 The Vidyalaya, which is one of the on-campus institutes run by the Ramakrishna Ashrama, Narendrapur, is also considering a plan to open four free coaching classes for the deserving children of the Narendrapur area, and utilise a portion of the funds for developing a childrens park.

 About 7,000 students have passed out from this 50-year-old school, and most of them have made important contributions to the making of our nation, said Swami Asaktananda, present secretary of the Vidyalaya. 

 We are continuing the tradition founded by Swami Lokeswaranandaji Maharaj, who was the founder-secretary and one of the eminent educationists of the Ramakrishna Mission, added the secretary.

 The golden jubilee celebrations will begin in January next year and continue till April 22, the day the school was founded in 1958.

 The institution has invited ex-students, the guardians of the past and present students, friends and well-wishers to participate in the golden jubilee celebrations.

 A total of 900 students, from the fifth to the 12th standard, are currently on the rolls of the Vidyalaya.

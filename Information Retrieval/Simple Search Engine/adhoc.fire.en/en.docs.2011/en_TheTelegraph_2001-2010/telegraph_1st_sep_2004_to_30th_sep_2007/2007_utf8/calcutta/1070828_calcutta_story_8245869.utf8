The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Journey of pain to take a train

 - Basic facilities missing in station for long-distance passengers

 RITH BASU

 Five pairs of long-distance trains ply to and from Shalimar station, near Andul, along with four pairs of local trains. But the station lacks basic infrastructure, like a washroom for women, food stalls and transportation facilities. Patients on the way to Vellore sometimes take the two Kerala-bound trains that leave from Shalimar around 11.30pm. Not only do they suffer, but those who come to see them off also have to struggle to get back home. Heres some of the reasons why the station is best avoided:

 NO TAXI: The taxi stand is without taxis. It is very difficult for those who come to see off passengers to return home unless they are ready to shell out exorbitant sums of money, says 73-year-old P.M. Menon, who visited the station to see off a relative.

 A.K. Satpathy, who took the Kurla Express from Shalimar for Tatanagar on Friday, said: I will take a train to Howrah on my return journey. It is highly likely that I might get stranded here.

 OFFICIALSPEAK: The deputy commercial manager (customer interaction) of South Eastern Railway, Archana Srivastav, said: Its up to the taxi drivers to come to the stand. Theres enough space to park cars.

 NO BUS: Rana Sarkar, on his way to Mumbai for training, took Fridays Kurla Express after dragging his luggage from the nearest bus stop at Betaitala a 15-minute walk along a muddy road. There wasnt a single porter around, he said.

 OFFICIALSPEAK: We have cleared and levelled a plot near the station for a bus stand. We have requested the state government to divert some buses to the station, especially those going to Botanical Gardens. We expect more cooperation from the state government, said Srivastav.

 NO FANS: Its difficult to wait at the station in the heat and humidity without ceiling or standing fans, points out Samar Mukherjee, a resident of Dum Dum. 

 OFFICIALSPEAK: There were fans at the station but all of them went out of order after a thunderstorm a month ago. The fans are being repaired, said Srivastav.

 NO FOOD/BOTTLED WATER STALLS: Satpathy was not carrying water. Water bottles were not available at the lone tea stall on the Shalimar station compound and the train did not have a pantry. The only passenger on an AC 3-tier compartment, he had to go without water till the next station. The railways should not start long-distance trains from any and everywhere, he grumbled.

 OFFICIALSPEAK: We have floated tenders and two food stalls should be started within two months, said Srivastav.

 NO WOMENS WASHROOM: There is no washroom for women at Shalimar. The one for men is unfit for use. I tried to use the toilet but it was in such a state that I could not, said Sarkar.

 OFFICIALSPEAK: There is a pay-and-use toilet nearby. People can use it. I will take up the cleanliness issue with the people concerned, said Srivastav.

 PATIENTSPEAK: Those travelling to Vellore for treatment on the Shalimar-Trivandrum Express and Gurudev Express are, perhaps, the worst hit. Both trains reach Katpadi Junction, the station nearest to Vellore Hospital, around 6am. This allows patients to reach the hospital at a convenient hour, making them choose these trains over other options from Howrah. 

 Metro tried to get in touch with Arun Kumar Chatterjee, the area manager, Shalimar. His peon, G.P. Mali, said he was playing carrom with his staff and could not meet anyone at that point of time. After a while, Mali came back to say that Chatterjee had gone out on inspection.

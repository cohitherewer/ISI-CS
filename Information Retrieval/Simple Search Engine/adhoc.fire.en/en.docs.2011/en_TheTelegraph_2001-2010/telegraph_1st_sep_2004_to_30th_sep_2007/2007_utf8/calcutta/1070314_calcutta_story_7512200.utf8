 Life terms for murder accused

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The convicts in the Sailen Das murder case, including former CPM chairman of Dum Dum Municipality Sudhir Bhattacharya, were sentenced to life imprisonment on Tuesday.

 They will also have to pay a fine of Rs 2,000 each, failing which the jail term will be increased by another two years.

 The sentence was read out by second additional judicial and sessions judge, Barasat, Sunil Chandra Barui.

 On Monday, the judge had held Bhattacharya, 87, guilty of masterminding the murder of Das, his party colleague and successor in the civic body. The other convicts are S.P. Kamath, Ibrahim Ali, Sheikh Ismail, Debashish Ghatak and Biswajit Burman. Bachchan Singh, an accused who later turned approver, has been let off.

 Bhattacharya said before entering the courtroom that he would move a higher court if the sentence was harsh.

 Before pronouncing the verdict, the judge summoned the convicts and asked if they would like to defend themselves. All six claimed innocence. Bhattacharya pleaded that the jail authorities be asked to arrange proper medicare for him, as he was very sick.

 He said from the prison van: I was in hospital for two months before Dass murder. How could I plot the killing? He accused police and the CPM of shielding the guilty.

 Amitava Basu, secretary of the CPMs North 24-Parganas committee, denied the charge. Bhattacharya has long been expelled from the party, he asserted.

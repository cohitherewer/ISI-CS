 Floating funeral: Fish

 killed overnight in mystery slaughter 

 It is a matter of great concern that some of the

 citys most reputed schools, most of them English-medium, have decided to restrict admission to kids living in nearby areas (The great learning divide, May 23). This has become a headache for the guardians. 

 It is true that students staying far away would have to spend a lot of time and energy to attend school, but attaching too much importance to the address of a child is unacceptable. It is unfair to deny guardians and their children the chance to avail of the best quality of teaching. North Calcuttans are likely to suffer because of this unwritten rule as most of the good schools in the city are in the south as pointed out in the report Distant north, June 24. 

 Also, the school authorities giving preference to applicants who live close by should mention that before the distribution of application kit. That would save many parents from wasting time and money. 

 The state education directorate should take up the matter in all seriousness to stop the practice. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 The report Fishy deathbed of fish, May 23, raised suspicions. It is difficult to understand how hundreds of fish in a pond next to Alipore Bodyguard Lines can be killed overnight. It is not difficult to believe that the constables poisoned the fish after being denied a share by the leaseholder of the pond, especially as they stand accused of threatening the man. 

 P.B. Saha,

 Salt Lake . 

 How can all the fish in a pond die? The fish

 probably died as a result of foul play following trouble among the owners

 of the pond. The guilty need to be punished severely for such an act. Since

 the pond is near the bodyguard lines, it needs to be investigated if policemen

 were involved.

 Apropos the report Civic pipeline to clear Buddha passage, May 26, it is good that the civic body is trying to solve the waterlogging problem at least on the chief ministers route to and from office. But why cant the civic body do the same for the common people? Hundreds of gigantic concrete pipes are lying on the two sides of Mukundapur Main Road for months but the civic body has not found the time to install them. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur. 

 If there is a hooch, drugs and satta den near the chief ministers residence then one can imagine how deplorable the condition of the state is (Crime thrives at Buddha door, May 29). The police excuse of lack of manpower is unconvincing. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder, 

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report Festival of colours in lynch wake, May 28, criminals control several areas of the city. Police obey them and even protect them. These criminals work for political parties and hence, enjoy political protection. It is only the ordinary people who suffer at their hands. The goons are sometimes jailed for show and released quickly. When people lose patience they can kill even the most dreaded criminal. The Chetla incident proves that. 

 Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 

 Chandbati, Hooghly. 

 One hopes that the police top brass read the report on illegal parking and extortion by local goons with the help of policemen (Busy road turn fee parking lot, May 21) and saw the equally telling photograph published alongside it. It is difficult to believe that the deputy commissioner (traffic) is unaware of the racket. 

 A.S. Mehta, 

 New Alipore. 

Apropos the report New-age home for old, May 25, it is heartening to learn that a home for senior citizens with modern facilities has come up in Konnagar. But the cost of living there is exorbitant. I request the state government to set up at least one affordable old-age home in every district, especially for people who are being harassed by younger members of the family. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report Missing girl sends letter to court, June 21, Rimita Naskars tutor Achintya Ghosh did not enter the Bidhannagar sub-divisional magistrates court during the bail hearing of Tapan Das Adhikari and hand over a letter from the girl to me requesting that the accused be freed. The presiding judge was Partha Sarathi Chatterjee and not Bipasha Mandal. I also did not speak to reporters in this regard. 

 Anjan Narayan Chowdhury, 

 Assistant Public Prosecutor, Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Bidhannagar.

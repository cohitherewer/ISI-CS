The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Gadiara

 Tucked away in a corner of the Howrah district, Gadiara is just right to de-stress over the weekend. The town is approximately 100 km from Calcutta and can be reached by car. At this time of the year, the greenery along the way is soothing to the eye and a welcome change. 

 Vegetarians beware! Gadiara, situated at the confluence of the Hooghly, Damodar and the Rupnarayan, is a haven for fish-lovers. They will have the pleasure of choosing from a wide variety of freshwater fish that is caught by fishermen whose boats dot the banks of the river.

 The New Chalantika Tourist Lodge, situated near the bus stand, provides an excellent view of the large expanse of water and the fishing boats. The river here is so wide that it appears like a sea.

 Even at the peak of summer, the rooms of the lodge facing the river do not even require a fan, leave alone an airconditioner. We were told that there is no electricity supply at night, but that hardly matters. I wonder why companies dont tap into the enormous potential of generating wind energy here. 

 Evening walk on the riverbank is an invigorating experience. The breeze from the river, the fishing boats and the sight of locals wading through waist-deep water to net baby shrimps can help one forget city life. Sit back to enjoy the serenity of the surroundings. 

 A rickshaw ride from the lodge to the jetty under a starry sky can be memorable. Our guide was a 20-year-old called Gopal, the eldest of a brood of 10. He told us that Geonkhali and Nurpur on the opposite bank were worth a visit.

 Various options of varying degrees of risk from country boats and dinghies to the more dependable ferry are available for the trip to the other side. For the more adventurous, speedboats are available. 

 For those looking for a refreshing weekend with good Bengali food, with the Rupnarayan ilish, Gadiara is paradise. And yes, you must try the freshly made rasogolla!

 Trip tips 

 Drive down Kona Expressway to NH4 and then take a left turn at Bagnan. Apart from the traffic snarl at Bagnan level crossing, the drive is pretty smooth. The speed-breakers are unusually high though. Apart from the state tourism development corporation lodge, there are private options. Room rates vary from Rs 250 to Rs 350 per night.

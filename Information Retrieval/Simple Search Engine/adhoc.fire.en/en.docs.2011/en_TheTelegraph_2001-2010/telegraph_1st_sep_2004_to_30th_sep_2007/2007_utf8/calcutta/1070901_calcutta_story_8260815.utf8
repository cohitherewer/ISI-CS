 Plea against Victoria fee

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 PAY AND WALK: Victoria Memorial. A Telegraph picture

Morning walkers at Victoria Memorial have expressed dissatisfaction over the high courts move to increase the entry fee for them from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000 per month. 

 On Friday, counsel for the morning walkers Pankaj Haldar requested the division bench of the court to reconsider the proposal.

 The bench, headed by Justice B. Bhattacharya, asked the lawyer to file an affidavit stating the grievances of his clients.

 During the hearing, environment activist Subhas Dutta pointed out that even though the court had banned parking of vehicles around the Memorial compound, at least 1,000 cars belonging to the morning walkers are kept outside Victoria every morning.

 The morning walkers have to pay a parking fee for keeping the cars on the road. But they park the vehicles without paying a paisa. Moreover, the practice is spoiling the areas atmosphere, said Dutta.

 The division bench also asked Haldar to state his clients views with regard to Duttas allegation in the affidavit.

 Last week, the court had directed the police commissioner to synchronise the traffic system around Victoria Memorial for controlling air pollution in the area. 

 The police lawyer on Friday prayed for seven days time to inform the court about the steps the force was going to take to improve traffic movement in the area.

 The division bench granted the prayer and set the next date of hearing on September 7.

 The civic authorities are planning a Rs 2-crore scheme to beautify the roofs of the Tallah waterworks and the Kasba booster pumping station.

 The roofs of the underground reservoirs at Tallah and Palta are spread over about 100,000 sq ft (6.9 bighas) each, which makes them bigger than Mohammad Ali Park, Sraddhananda Park or Mysore Garden.

 The civic civil engineering department is preparing the project blueprint, which will be submitted to municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay next week. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has given his nod to the project.

 We are starting with Tallah and Kasba. We plan to beautify the other booster pumping stations too. Even drainage pumping stations will get a facelift, said Bandyopadhyay. 

 Two greenhouses, an open-air theatre and a childrens amusement park will be set up on the roof of the Tallah reservoir, said Soumitra Bhattacharya, the deputy chief engineer (civil). Similar facilities will be built at Kasba.

 The civic body is also developing a swimming pool and a park near Alochhaya cinema in Beleghata. It has not yet been handed over the plot.

 The decision to invest in the project was taken after the current owners told us that they had no objection if the civic authorities turn the property into a park along with a swimming pool, said the municipal commissioner.

 The CMC has drawn up a Rs 70-lakh package for the plot, known as Sarkarmath, out of which Rs 12 lakh has been spent on developing a seven-bigha swimming pool.

 The mayor said the civic body had taken a policy decision to create more green patches in the city by taking over open spaces that are being used as parks, with permission from the owners.

 Train hit was fatal, says doctor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rizwanur Rahman died after being hit by a train, according to the doctor who conducted a post-mortem on the body at NRS Hospital on Sunday. He is yet to submit the report.

 The injuries were ante mortem in nature, which proves that he was alive when the train hit him. The doctor concluded that the injuries resulted in the youths death, said an officer of Government Railway Police, Dum Dum. 

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee called a press meet on Sunday and announced that Rizwanur had committed suicide. A senior officer of the detective departments homicide wing, however, said: The post-mortem report cannot specify whether it was suicide, homicide or accident.

 Another officer said circumstantial evidence plays a major role in such cases. In Rizwanurs case, he was preparing to fight to bring his wife back home. We dont find any reason to believe that he committed suicide, he asserted.

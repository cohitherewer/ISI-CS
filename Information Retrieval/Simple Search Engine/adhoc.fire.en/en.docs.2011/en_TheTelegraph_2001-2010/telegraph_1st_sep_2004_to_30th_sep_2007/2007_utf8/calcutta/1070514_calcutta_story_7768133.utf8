 Sculpted beauties

 Indian sculpture has a long and glorious history that can be traced to the days of Mohenjodaro and Harappan civilizations. With the passage of time, the art form revealed varied forms of stylistic excellence. The sculpture of Bengal was rich in aesthetic appeal and made its own distinctive mark with its three-dimensional forms in several mediums and relief works in the panels of terracotta temples. Sculptors of succeeding generations opened up new vistas in creative expression, while altering conventional practice according to the need and trend of the day. Glimpses of Contemporary Bengal Sculpture, the ongoing group exhibition, brings together recent works of select practising sculptors of Bengal, representing various decades of the last 50 years. Participants include Madhab Bhattacharjee, Sarbari Roychowdhury, Uma Siddhanta, Shankar Ghosh, Niranjan Pradhan, Tarak Garai, Janak Jhankar Narzary, Anil Sen, Sunil Kumar Das, Bimal Kundu, Pankaj Panwar, Sandip Chakraborty (a sculpture by him appears above) and Sunanda Das.

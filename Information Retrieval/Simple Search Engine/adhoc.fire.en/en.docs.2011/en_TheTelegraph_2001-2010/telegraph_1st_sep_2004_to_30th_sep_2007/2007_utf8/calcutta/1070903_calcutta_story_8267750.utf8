The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Nokia signal on damages

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three days after the BL-D3 battery in Kishori Sahas Nokia 2100 cellphone exploded, representatives from the companys Gurgaon office met her husband Suman at Jadavpur police station and assured him of compensation if forensic tests confirmed that the accessories of the phone were original.

 A regional manager and a sales manager from Nokias Gurgaon office met me and told me that they would pay compensation or replace the mobile phone if investigations proved that a fault in the accessories led to the blast, Suman told Metro. 

 The officials did not specify how much time the investigation would take or how much compensation would be paid. Suman, however, has not ruled out moving the consumers forum. He said he would meet the president of the Federation of Consumer Associations, Mala Banerjee, on Monday.

 According to Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), the Nokia officials photographed the battery that exploded and the phone. These will be sent to the companys Finland headquarters for further examination. The forensic department of the city police is also conducting an inquiry into the matter, he said.

 Kishori, who is five months pregnant, was cleaning a room in their Ganguly Bagan home on Wednesday afternoon when the mobile phone, which had been put on charge, exploded. The 25-year-old homemaker was not injured, but the explosion scared her and she had to be taken to a local hospital. She was, however, discharged after preliminary check-up.

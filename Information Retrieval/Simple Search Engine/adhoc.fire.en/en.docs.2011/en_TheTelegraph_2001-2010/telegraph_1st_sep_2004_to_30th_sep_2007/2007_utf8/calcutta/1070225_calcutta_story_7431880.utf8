 There are sports carnivals and there are sports carnivals. But a sports carnival, harking back to the days of the Raj with a desi twist? That was the idea at the prize distribution ceremony of the inter-city club sports carnival, presented in association with The Telegraph, last Sunday evening.

 The three-day event hosted by nine popular clubs in the city culminated in a grand finale on the manicured lawns of Saturday Club. Calcuttas smart set rubbed shoulders with visitors from neighbouring Bangladesh. While Bombay Gymkhana bagged the winners trophy, Saturday Club came a close second. Sports is a binding agent, observed A.K. Chatterjee, president, Saturday Club.

 The crowd was a mishmash of the old brigade jostling for space with GeNext. Nattily turned out men, elegant women with silk yards draped around them, a dash of haute fashion But has club culture hit rock bottom with the lounge-pub culture gaining on popularity? Has the concept of socialising undergone a metamorphosis with youngsters preferring the cool pubs to the old-world charm of clubs?

 The club culture, going back to the days of the Raj, is not at all redundant. It is an integral part of Calcuttas social life, said ex-convener Shyamal Mitra. It is all about spending an evening together amidst friends, chirped an elegant woman, her hands clutching on to a glass of bubbly.

 Thereafter, flowing spirits accompanied by Crispy Fried Prawns, Pepper Chicken and Vegetable Spring Rolls set the ball rolling. The main course was Chicken Bada Butter Masala and Mutton Roganjosh, while vegetarians gorged on Vegetable Malai Kofta and Paneer Pasinda. 

 Foundation gala

 Hindustan Club celebrated its 62nd foundation day last Sunday. A grand and flowery entrance led the way to the 10-storeyed infrastructure on Sarat Bose Road. At the first-floor hall, women members came dressed in finery, waiting for the guests of honour, sports and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and agriculture minister Naren De. 

 After the customary lighting of the lamp, De took the mike. Since the audience comprised mostly members of the club belonging to the Marwari or Gujarati community, the language barrier was broken with impressive subtlety. Ek problem hai. If I speak in Hindi, you will forget your Hindi. And English is neither yours nor mine, so I shall speak in Bengali, said De, with a twinkle in his eye. Club president Pawan Jain put forward a request for more land with a shayari. The new club membership directory was also released. A spectacular laser show followed.

 Members feasted on a sumptuous spread. There were counters for Gujarati, Bengali and Punjabi food and a Delhi chaat stand.

 Pous Sankranti, on January 14 this year, is the time for pithe and payesh. Diabetics, too, can now tuck into the sweets, courtesy innovations by Jadavpur-based Hindusthan Sweets.

 This year, we plan to make chitai pithe and payesh for diabetics. We are going to hold a pithe and payesh exhibition at our Jadavpur store over the weekend, where the special items will be available, said Rabindra Kumar Paul, managing partner, Hindusthan Sweets.

 The chitai pithe for diabetics will be made of rice, coriander leaves and salt. Those who do not like sweets or cannot have them will like the taste. The special items will be made of herbal ingredients and be sugar-free, added Paul.

 The other delicacies at the exhibition will include patisapta, dudh chitai pithe, khir puli, gokul pithe, chosir payesh and khoa khirer payesh. Some of the items will be herbal and sugar-free, stated Paul.

 According to him, the company is working on rasogolla and sandesh with thankuni leaves. Hot rasogolla is good for those with chronic amoebiasis. The herbal equivalent will be even more effective in keeping the disease in check. 

 The company is also collaborating with the agriculture and food engineering department of IIT Kharagpur on the use of stevia as a substitute for sugar, bimbi creepers and aloe vera.

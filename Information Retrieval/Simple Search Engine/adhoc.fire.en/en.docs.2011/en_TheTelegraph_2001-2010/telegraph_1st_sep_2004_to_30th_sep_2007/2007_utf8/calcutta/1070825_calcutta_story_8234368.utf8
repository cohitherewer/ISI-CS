 Jawan accused of bosss child molest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An 11-year-old daughter of a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officer was allegedly molested by a constable of the force on Thursday evening.

 The constable, Dinesh Rai, a bugler in the CRPF band, has been arrested and suspended. 

 Charges of molestation and attempt to rape have been slapped on him, after a test on the girl at Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital confirmed sexual assault.

 According to the complaint lodged by the victims father, an assistant sub-inspector, the girl was molested while she was climbing the staircase of their apartment block on the campus of the third signal battalion in Salt Lakes Sector V.

 Rai lives with his family on the ground floor of the building, while the girls family occupies the first floor.

 An officer of Bidhannagar (East) police station said the incident took place around 4.30pm, when the girl, a Class IV student, was returning home from school.

 Rai molested her while she was climbing the staircase of the apartment block that houses their residential quarters. She rushed upstairs, sobbing, and narrated the incident to her parents, said Prasun Banerjee, the sub-divisional police officer of Bidhannagar, who is investigating the case.

 The girl was crying inconsolably. She told me that she had tried to put up a resistance against Rai, but in vain. The girl is in trauma, Banerjee added.

 The police have come to know that Rai, father of three children, had indulged in several cases of sexual misconduct in the past, though no complaint was lodged against him.

 We have arrested the constable and taken him in our custody. He will be produced in court on Saturday, said Ashoke Biswas, the additional superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

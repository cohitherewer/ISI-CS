 Bus for challenged

 - Service 

 launch on busy routes 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The transport department will run 10 low-floor buses in the city from February 1 for the benefit of the physically-challenged.

 Each bus, costing Rs 18 lakh, will seat 44 people and offer standing room to about 52 passengers.

 The doors will be automatic and will permit wheelchairs to be rolled in and out.

 The buses will initially touch BBD Bag, Chittaranjan Avenue, Sealdah, Rashbehari Avenue, Gariahat, Maniktala and the airport.

 We have shortlisted some busy routes for the initial run. The aim is to provide the maximum benefit to office-goers. We will later operate similar buses on other routes, too, said principal secretary of the department Sumantra Chowdhury.

 The welfare department had called for the launch of low-floor buses about a year ago. Many states have already started running such buses.

 The buses are designed keeping in mind the needs of the physically-challenged. Ordinary people, too, can enjoy the comfort of these special buses, added Chowdhury.

 Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) will initially buy 10 low-floor buses from Tata Motors. More buses will be bought if the project turns out to be a success.

 The transport department will monitor the service. It will see to it that the buses serve the purpose for which they have been acquired, said a senior official of the department.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty is expected to inaugurate the service in January-end, said CSTC managing director Asok Bhattacharya.

 After the launch of low-floor buses, the transport department will concentrate on revamping the service of the airconditioned white line buses.

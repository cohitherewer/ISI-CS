 Caution on curves 

 - High accident rate linked to faulty turning radii at crossings; kerbs to be trimmed

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The curves are dangerous in over 75 per cent of the crossings in the city.

 Realising the risk, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has decided to fix the curvature problem at these crossings.

 In more than 75 per cent of the roads, the curvature is much less than the turning radius of the vehicles that use them. We are trying to rectify the problem, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 From snarls to accidents wrong curvature affects vehicular movement and safety on the road. According to data collated by the traffic department of Calcutta Police, over 90 accidents took place at 12 prominent crossings in the city last year (see box).

 Though the high rate of accidents one in four days cannot solely be linked to the road radii, the civic body wants to minimise the chances of mishaps due to faulty curvature.

 The turning radii of the vehicles had not been taken into account while determining the curvature of the roads, pointed out town planner Dipankar Sinha.

 For example, he explained, turning radii at most crossings vary between 1.2 and 2 metres, while an Ambassador requires a 5.2-metre radius for a smooth turn. The turning radius is about 4 metres for Maruti cars, while heavier vehicles like buses and trucks need larger radii.

 According to him, champering trimming of the corners of the kerbs is the only solution.

 At present, the civic body is conducting a survey of the major crossings to chalk out a plan on how to trim the corners. 

 We will try to create as little disturbance as possible. First, we will try to trim the pavements. In case, pavements are not available, we will have to touch the buildings, said Sinha. Work on the major crossings will start in a few months.

 Champering was successfully tested in Jadavpur in the late 1990s. Rooms or courtyards of a number of houses had to be demolished to fine tune the sharp turns.

 Aware that some house-owners may object to the demolition proposal, municipal commissioner Bandyopadhyay said: We will compensate for the loss by allowing the houses to be extended vertically.

 Constable suspended

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Milan Kanti Singha, the Calcutta Armed Police constable who fired four rounds from his rifle at Alipore Bodyguard Lines on Thursday night, was suspended on Friday. His blood sample is being tested to find out if Singha was under the influence of drugs or liquor. A departmental inquiry will be conducted into the incident.

 The police said Singha had not suffered from mental illness during 10 years of service. We also found out that he was not facing any problem related to his service or duty schedule. He never complained to anyone about any problem, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee.

 The 33-year-old constable had fired four rounds from his .303 rifle around 8pm, hitting the ceiling of the first-floor of a building which houses the offices of senior IPS officers. He was guarding the cash room on the floor.

 Singha told us that he opened fire on seeing something suspicious, said an officer of Bodyguard Lines. The constable from Mohammadbazar, in Birbhum, did not allow anyone to come close to him for more than an hour. When one or two policemen tried to get close, he aimed the rifle at them and threatened to shoot. Such behaviour does not support his claim, said another officer.

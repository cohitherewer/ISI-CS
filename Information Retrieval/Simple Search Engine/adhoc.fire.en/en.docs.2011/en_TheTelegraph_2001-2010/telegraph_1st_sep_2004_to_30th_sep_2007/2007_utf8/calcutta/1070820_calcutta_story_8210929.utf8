The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rs 60 lakh conned in PMs name

 - Forged endorsement from Manmohan Singh produced to hoodwink loan-seekers

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh

 The authorities of Regional Resource Development Organisation in Rajarhat promised clients loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). And for the doubting Thomases, they produced letters from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and state legislators, endorsing the organisations credentials. 

 Two years and over Rs 60 lakh later, their luck ran out as Calcutta police raided their office last week and arrested Partho Deb Roy, his wife Shivani, son Debojyoti and Saumitro Roy for allegedly cheating people using forged letters by the Prime Minister and the legislators. 

 Partho and Debojyoti are directors of the company, while Shivani is the managing director and Saumitro the CEO. The special cell of the detective department had been on their trail since last year, following a complaint by a company.

 To win the confidence of clients, the racket used to show a forged letter from Manmohan Singh, lauding the organisation for serving people for years. Besides, the company also had letters of appreciation with forged signatures of state MLAs. 

 It was a major racket and was run smartly since 2005, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner (detective department). They have cheated over Rs 60 lakh from several people in the city.

 An investigator said: The letterhead of the organisation, with a forged national emblem, stated that it had been helping people for over two decades to obtain loans from ADB and Nabard. The company took 15 to 20 per cent of the loan amount sought in advance as commission from clients. 

 Senior officers of the detective department had contacted the Prime Ministers Office to verify the authenticity of the letter. The PMO officials wrote back last week, confirming that the letterhead and Singhs signature were forged, added the officer added.

 The arrested four had published advertisements in several city newspapers in 2005, proclaiming that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had authorised the organisation to act as a facilitator in granting loans from government agencies as well as from ADB and Nabard. The RBI is contemplating action against the company.

 The company had used the forged letter from the Prime Minister in the advertisement. A large number of people turned up at the Rajarhat office after seeing the advertisement. Many of them were cheated. We are trying to find out who else were involved in the racket, stated the investigator.

 A microcosmic peep into macro world

 Little Tatan is very worried and has lost his peace of mind because his country is reeling under severe draught. The cause of this calamity is the Kings decision to experiment with various new war weapons. Tatans search for a solution leads him to the Tree, the Stone and the Rabbit, and they all suggest him to look for the white pigeon, the harbinger of peace. The bird will usher in peace and prosperity in the country, they insist. Tatans quest for the white pigeon begins. Will he be able to combat the three demons: the forest, the mountain and the iceland, and restore peace for his country? This forms the crux of the first one-act play, Tatan Aar Sada Payra (Tatan and the White Pigeon).Direction: Tapas Das. The second one-act play, directed by Mithu De and Rana Mukherjee, Kahani Ek Tote Ki (Hindi) is about a parrot. Once the kings men caught hold of a parrot and brought him to the king. The benign king wanted the bird to get equal opportunity like his subjects and hence instructed his men to impart proper education to the bird. His subjects saw this as an opportunity to fool the king and earn some easy bucks. They began educating the poor bird. The parrot was subjected to sheer torture in the name of education and ultimately the system killed the tiny bird. Both the plays are produced by Esho Natak Shikhi, a childrens drama workshop-cum-production centre and enacted by a group of talented and enthusiastic children.

A group of political leaders and local residents held a demonstration outside a liquor shop on Kabiguru Sarani, in Behala, on Friday, demanding its closure.

 The protesters claimed that the shop had been allowed to come up near a school and two temples, flouting the law.

 Five persons, including leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Partha Chattopadhyay (Trinamul Congress) and local CPM councillor Ajay Adhikari, were arrested. They are out on bail.

 A large contingent of police, including the Rapid Action Force and the combat force, was deployed in the neighbourhood.

 Residents said the excise department had issued the liquor licence to Tapan Sen in 2006. But he could not open the shop because of strong resistance from the residents.

 In September 2006, Sen had moved the high court, which asked police to help him set up the shop.

 On Friday, Sen moved a contempt petition in the court, saying he could not run the shop because of the agitation.

 The court directed superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta and other senior officers to look into the matter.

 Justice Pranab Chattopaddhaya ruled that as the government had issued the licence, the police should provide the owner security to run the shop. The judge also said the protesters have no right to obstruct business. They can approach the court with their problems, he observed.

 Trinamul leader Chattopadhyay said he would continue with his agitation till the licence is cancelled. 

 Asish Basu, member of the CPMs Behala (east) zonal committee, said the area was once a den of notorious criminals. The situation will worsen if the liquor shop is allowed to run, he pointed out.

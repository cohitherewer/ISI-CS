 A gang raided a house in Cossipore on Saturday night, while all members of the household were wide awake, and went on a looting spree after severely assaulting a woman.

 The goons pounced on her and gagged her with a piece of cloth. Before leaving, they blindfolded the woman, tied her hands and legs and dumped her in a narrow gap between an almirah and the bed. She has been admitted to a local hospital.

 Police said the dacoits had looted jewellery worth Rs 50,000. A preliminary investigation suggests that local criminals were involved in the dacoity. No arrest has been made, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Sachin Dutta, head of the family, said he and daughter-in-law Sumita were watching television on the ground floor of the double-storeyed house, while son Saibal was in his shop in another part on the same floor. 

 There is one room on the first floor, where my son and his wife live. The room was locked and the keys were with my daughter-in-law, said Dutta. Sumita, as she does every day, went upstairs around 10.45 pm to change before dinner. Around 11.30 pm, while dinner was being served, I called her several times but she did not respond, Dutta recounted.

 I went to the landing of the staircase and found the room closed. No light could be seen under the door. Sensing trouble, I called my son, he recalled.

 Saibal, who runs a telephone booth and sells plastic furniture, entered the room and found it ransacked.

 As I switched on the light, I found the almirah open and my wife squeezed into the narrow gap between the bed and the almirah, her limbs tied and face gagged, said Saibal.

 Sumita later told police that as soon as she entered the room, someone pressed his hands on her mouth from behind. Soon, two others joined him and they pushed me in. All three had their faces covered with gamchha, said Sumita.

 I tried to resist them and even hit one of the dacoits on his head with a flower vase. The other two immediately gagged me and forced me to show the place where the keys to the almirah were kept, she added. She lost consciousness when the dacoits forced a piece of cloth into her mouth. 

 Police said the dacoits knew that Sumita would go upstairs at that particular time every night.

 CAS trouble hits court

 OUR BUREAU

 A consumers association moved the high court on Wednesday for redress of problems faced by cable television subscribers in the area covered by Conditional Access System (CAS) Phase I before roll-out of the second phase.

 The public interest litigation by the Federation of Consumers Association will come up for hearing on Thursday before the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.K. Roy. 

 According to the organisation, the launch of CAS in the city has been a failure. The three lakh-plus consumers who have opted for CAS have had to suffer. They are at the mercy of multi-system operators (MSOs) and cable operators. The subscribers were better off before, said Mala Banerjee, the association head.

 Banerjee claimed that the association has received several complaints from residents of the area covered by Phase I who said they were not being allowed to rent set top boxes (STBs). Those who have not subscribed to pay channels are allegedly not being provided the free-to-air channels either. 

 According to Banerjee, the service providers do not have the infrastructure to implement CAS and have been able to supply STBs to only 60,000 subscribers. Most of the cable-operators have not been able to encrypt the digital signals required to implement CAS.

 A section of industry insiders expressed satisfaction over the move by the consumers association.

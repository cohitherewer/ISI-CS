 Civic truck crushes cop 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Barely 48 hours ago, traffic police inspector Samir Mukherjee had been manning peak-hour traffic in Jadavpur. 

 Mukherjee, in his 50s, was crushed under a speeding truck on Monday afternoon, while he was crossing Ultadanga Main Road.

 A resident of Dum Dum Road, Mukherjee had gone to admit his 22-year-old son Soumyadip to a private hotel management institute.

 According to police, Mukherjee, after parking his jeep, was trying to cross the road with his son, when he was hit by a scooter and then crushed by a speeding Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) truck. 

 Even before Soumyadip could raise an alarm, the truck sped away, leaving Mukherjee in a pool of blood. He was taken to a nursing home, where he succumbed to his injuries in a few hours.

 It seems Mukherjee was in a hurry. At first he was hit by a speeding scooter. He lost his balance and fell on the road. Even before he could get up on his feet, a speeding CMC truck crushed him, said a senior officer of Shyambazar Traffic Guard. 

 The vehicle couldnt be detained but we have found out that it was belongs to the CMC. We are looking for the driver, said Pritish Nandy, deputy superintendent of police (traffic).

 In another accident, Gobindo Sen, a home guard of the Sealdah Traffic Guard, was injured when a speeding truck went over his right leg. He was rushed to NRS Medical College and Hospital, from where he was released after treatment.

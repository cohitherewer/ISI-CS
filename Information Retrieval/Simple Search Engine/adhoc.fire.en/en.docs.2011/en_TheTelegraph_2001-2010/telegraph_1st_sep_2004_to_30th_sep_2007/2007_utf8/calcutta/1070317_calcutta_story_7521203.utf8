 One school is fighting a lone battle against noise pollution on Park Street, but with little to show for results. The road has emerged as one of the noisiest in the city, despite the presence of schools and hospitals. 

 Students of Apeejay School, on Park Street, started the campaign against noise pollution in September 2005. It is an awareness programme against unnecessary honking, said cultural coordinator of the school Janardhan Ghosh.

 Students of Class VIII and above, along with their teachers, took part in the three-phase campaign. As a first step, about 20 students with placards on noise norms stood outside the school.

 The institution also arranged a survey of the locality. Senior students walked up to hawkers, taxi drivers and pedestrians to make them aware of the need to curb noise pollution. 

 It was initially difficult, but gradually, the interactions became easier. We got the message across, said Neha Dubey of Class XI.

 With the help of the civic body, the students also performed skits in the area. Our three-fold movement made only a temporary difference, added Neha.

 Besides Apeejay, there are several schools on Park Street. Assembly of God Church Hospital and Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre are also on it. But the administration has done nothing to curb the problem.

 The school authorities sought the help of traffic police to tackle noise pollution. The cops started fining motorists using horns unnecessarily, but soon discontinued the drive. 

 The honking affects not only the students, but also the patients. Almost nothing has changed due to the schools campaign, said Partha Bandopadhyay of Assembly of God Church Hospital.

 Apeejay School principal Reeta Chatterjee said: There has to be mass awareness, as the problem cannot be dealt with individually.

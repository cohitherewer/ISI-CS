 The Garia bridge was thrown open with much fanfare in March, to ease the car crawl on the southern corridor. But a month after its inauguration, the traffic congestion remains as bad as ever. 

 Commuters blame the autorickshaws, buses and trucks plying on the Garia-Sonarpur and Garia-Baruipur routes for the chaos that prevails. 

 We expected a smooth journey after the opening of the bridge. The situation has not changed. Throughout the day, autorickshaws are parked on one flank of the bridge, creating traffic congestion, rued daily commuter Tapan Adhikari.

 The original bridge was built in 1901 by a Scottish firm. In 1997, its right flank was built to handle the increasing traffic pressure. It was inaugurated by the then chief minister Jyoti Basu.

 The left flank was demolished in August 2005 and reconstructed by the irrigation department. It was opened this year.

 According to commuters, the traffic is most chaotic around 9 pm, when trucks loaded with sand and autorickshaws are parked on the bridge, blocking traffic. 

 The traffic police have set up railings on the bridge, which add to the jam. 

 There are traffic snarls on the bridge throughout the day. At night, constables do not let a single truck pass without taking a bribe. This chokes the route further, complained another commuter.

 Additional superintendent (industrial) of police D.P. Singh said: We must take steps to improve the traffic situation on the bridge. If anybody lodges a written complaint, we will take immediate action against the constables on duty. 

 Local borough chairman and CPM councillor Batakrishna Roy held out the assurance: I will meet the autorickshaw unions and the police to sort out the problems.

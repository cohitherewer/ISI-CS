 The City Diary

nAcute depression had led 32-year-old Sanjit Das to commit suicide on his second marriage anniversary. After going through a diary recovered from his room, police said on Monday that Sanjit was not happy with his life. Sanjits wife Sathi could not be interrogated. The exact reason for the suicide could be known only after Sathi speaks, said a senior police officer. 

nVicky, 20, was arrested on Monday for allegedly trying to rape a three-year-old in Watgunge, in the port area. Police said the accused lured the girl into his room by offering her chocolates. Some local youths noticed this and raised an alarm.

nA fire broke out in a chemical factory and spread to its adjoining shanties on Bagmari Road, in Maniktala, on Monday afternoon. Five fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the flames. No one was injured. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained.

nTwo policemen of Chetla thana were injured after being attacked by around 250 members of a local club late on Sunday. The club members were playing loudspeakers on the occasion of Shivratri. They attacked the cops on being told to switch off the loudspeakers.

nArjun Das, the peon of a coil manufacturing unit on Bentinck Street who was found murdered on Sunday morning, was strangled to death and then the assassins slit his throat.

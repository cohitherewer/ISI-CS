 Blaze fails to shut firecracker factories

 The illegal trade that took the lives of three child workers last week continues unabated at Nilgunge in Barasat. And child labour still keeps the firecracker factories running. 

 More than 250 families in the area are engaged in the illegal manufacture of crackers. We know that children are employed by these units but cannot take action, as many earn their livelihood from these factories, said Malati Das, the pradhan of Ichhapur-Nilgunge panchayat.

 According to her, closure of nearly 25 brick-fields in the area because of shortage in raw material resulted in loss of jobs for many local residents who are now working in the illegal cracker units.

 Some local residents, however, said that the panchayat was more concerned about the possible loss of vote bank by taking action against the factories.

 The volume of the business can be gauged by the fact that 38 metric tonne of raw material for making crackers was seized in two nights after the fire.

 The work, however, is going on as usual in the houses at Fatehabad in Narayanpur. We have no other option but to employ children. Since kids work for low wages, every manufacturer employs them. Even if we are reluctant to employ children, their family members insist that we take them, said Abdul Jabbar, who runs an illegal firecracker factory near the public health engineering department tank.

 Najma Biwi, who lives next door to 11-year-old Akhter, who died in Tuesdays blast, said: My 14-year-old son Farooq is involved in making crackers. I know this is risky but I still have to allow him to do so. He gets only Rs 25 by making 1,000 crackers. Can you please ask the government to increase the wage?

 Akhters maternal uncle Nizamuddin said that even though the parents ask their children not to go to the factories, they go there and work on the pretext of playing in the field or even attending school. If they lie to go to the factory, what can we do? We cannot keep an eye on them all day while trying to earn a living ourselves, he added.

 The local panchayat has only one solution to offer. The use of child labour in making illegal crackers can only stop if the factories are granted licences. The factory-owners want licences but there is a lack of interest on the part of the district magistrate or sub-divisional officer of Barasat, said a panchayat official.

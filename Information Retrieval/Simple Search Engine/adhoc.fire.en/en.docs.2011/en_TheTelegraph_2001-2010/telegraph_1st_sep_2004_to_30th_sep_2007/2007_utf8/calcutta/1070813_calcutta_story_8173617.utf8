 Thousands of kites inscribed with messages of peace from students of India and Pakistan will be on display at various schools in the city on the eve of Independence Day.

 The Kites for Peace project, an initiative of the Seagull Foundation for the Arts, aims to promote peace and friendship among the students of the two countries.

 Most children in India and Pakistan grow up hearing the familiar narrative about the Partition that gives rise to a biased view of the event. We want them to realise that the two countries are not enemies, said Indrani Roy, the programme coordinator, PeaceWorks. The Kites for Peace project is part of PeaceWorks, which was launched by the Foundation as a response to the Gujarat carnage in 2002.

 In Pakistan, the project was launched in January at International Schools Educational Olympiad, where students from 92 schools wrote peace messages on kites. In India, it was launched in April, with Bengal Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi signing a kite with the message Dosti Zindabad.

 Around 4,000 students from various schools in India took part in the project. We have received over 5,000 kites from Pakistan and India. Some of them will be displayed in various schools in the both countries to mark the 60th year of Partition, said Roy.

 The city schools where the kites will be displayed include La Martiniere for Girls, Gokhale Memorial Girls School and Calcutta Girls High School.

 PeaceWorks has launched another initiative, Stories for Peace, in which those between 14 and 18 years of age from the two countries can send in stories carrying the message of peace. Twenty stories will be selected for an anthology which Seagull Books will publish later this year.

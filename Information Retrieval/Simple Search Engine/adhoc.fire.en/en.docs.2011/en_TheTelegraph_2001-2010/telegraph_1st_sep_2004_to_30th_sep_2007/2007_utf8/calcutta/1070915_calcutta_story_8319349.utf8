The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Prince Harry

 You are brave, enthusiastic and occasionally, a bit boastful. You are efficient and cooperative at work, but never aggressive. You are money-wise and keep your chequebook well-balanced. In love, you express yourself clearly and precisely.

 Kusum Bhandari

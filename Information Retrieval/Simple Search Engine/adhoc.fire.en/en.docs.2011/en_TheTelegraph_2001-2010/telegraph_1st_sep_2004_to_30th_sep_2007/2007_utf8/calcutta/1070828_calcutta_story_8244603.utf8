 Teenage trio go missing

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Three Class IX students of Mitra Institution (Main) are missing since Sunday. None of their parents has received a ransom call. 

 Debojyoti Das, Soumyajit Chakrabarty and Saurav Guha left their homes in Jhamapukur Lane, Salt Lake and Badurbagan Lane, respectively, in the morning. All three told their parents that they were going to Shyambazar to attend their drawing class. They said they would return by evening.

 Sauravs aunt first lodged a missing complaint at Amherst Street police station at night.

 We have started a probe into the disappearance of the trio. As of now, it doesnt seem to be a case of kidnapping, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). 

 The three boys, around 14 years old, were very close to each other. According to the police, one of their teachers in school spotted them at Nicco Park, in school uniform, a few days back.

 We want to find out if the trio would regularly skip classes and how they had fared in their tests recently, said an officer of Amherst Street police station.

 The parents did not know that the three were together till Sauravs parents called up Soumyajits parents for information about their son and learnt that their son, too, was missing.

 The police said they have put two different teams on the case and hope to trace the three soon.

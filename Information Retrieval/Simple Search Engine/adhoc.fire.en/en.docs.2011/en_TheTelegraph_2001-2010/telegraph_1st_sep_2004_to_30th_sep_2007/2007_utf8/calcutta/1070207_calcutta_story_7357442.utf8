 Cheap labour, illegal job

 The Sheffield of the East has been reduced to a cluster of sweatshops and the mushrooming of hole-in-the-wall units tell the saga of the great industrial decline of Howrah. 

 But on Monday, the closely-kept secret of exploitation and illegal practice in these units tumbled out as seven employees of Mahalaxmi Embroidery, on 34/1 Bon Behari Bose Road, were trapped in a daybreak inferno and charred to death. 

 Despite the loss of seven lives, Tuesday was another business-as-usual day in the units.

 In Alam Mistry Lane, a man in his 40s was busy putting aluminium sheets into a machine, while eight-year-old Manu was collecting utensils coming out of it. The metal residues could be spotted all over Manus frail frame. 

 I stand near the big machine and collect the utensils, from 8 in the morning till the evening, said Manu, oblivious of the potential danger of his workplace. 

 The sweatshop superviser pleaded ignorance. He is a local boy and comes here to play. We do not know him, said superviser Shakil. 

 Child labourers like Manu can be found in almost all sweatshops in Pilkhana, Alam Mistry Lane and Salkia, where concentration of sweatshops is highest in the city. 

 Not just in numbers, Howrah scores over the Tangra-Tiljala-Topsia triangle with the variety of items from perfume corks and baba suits to aluminium utensils and pens produced by these sweatshops. 

 Here, rent is low, tenants are accommodating and unskilled labour is easily and cheaply available, explained Middya Omar Khayyam, owner of a baba suit-manufacturing unit in Alam Mistry Lane. 

 In most cases, the labourers live in the units stashed with inflammable items and work through the night under lock-and-key. 

 Though the workers are aware that a repeat of Monday mornings incident is likely in their sweatshops, poverty forces them to remain locked in. 

 And the authorities are not interested in changing the status quo. We cannot clamp down these illegal units unless there are complaints, said Milan Kanti Das, additional superintendent of police (Town).

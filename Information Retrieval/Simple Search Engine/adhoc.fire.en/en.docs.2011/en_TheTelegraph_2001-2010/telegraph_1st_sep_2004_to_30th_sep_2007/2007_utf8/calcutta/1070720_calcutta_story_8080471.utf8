 Time is money for fliers

 Todays question: Should airlines pay compensation to other passengers if one falls ill on board and the flight has to return? More letters will be published next week

B.N.Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 Airlines companies should positively pay compensation to other passengers who pay a lump sum to reach the destination quickly. The damage could be minimised by off-loading the sick passenger to the nearest aerodrome, then continuing the flight with the others.

 The question does not arise if the flight is resumed after unloading the sick passenger. But if it is cancelled, surely compensation should be paid. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Beleghata

 Life is more precious than anything else in the world. If anyone falls ill on the flight then it should return for treatment. This is a question of humanity. So, question of compensation does not arise. 

Suyesha Kanungoe, 

 Kalighat Road

 People take a flight for many reasons. While someone rushes for treatment, others might be in a hurry to join a new job. Again, someone has to reach his examination centre and another has a deal to close. Time matters. If one falls ill on board, for his or her sake the flight has to return. But compensation to other passengers is a must. 

Prasenjit Das, 

 Jadavpur 

 No, due to the illness of one passenger the others should not be deprived. The airline should do a medical check-up of a passenger before boarding. Despite that if a passenger feels sick then the cabin crew members should carry medicines to tide over the journey time. In the worst case, the pilot should land at the nearest airport and set off again leaving the ill passenger behind. It should be remembered that many take a flight on emergency. So, compensation is not a solution.

Biman Saha,

 Lake Town

 Neither any passenger nor an airline is responsible for one falling ill on board a plane. There may be cases that an exam candidate or a patient going for an emergency operation suffers as a result. As the airline has no hand in causing illness on board, it cannot be forced to pay compensation, and no passenger should claim it either on humanitarian grounds.

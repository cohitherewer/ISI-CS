 The pedestrian plaza opposite New Market, unveiled by the chief minister four months ago, has been taken over by local toughs, who have converted it into an unauthorised parking zone for two-wheelers.

 The plaza set up at a cost of Rs 4 crore was part of the Parkomat project under Lindsay Street, developed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and a private firm, Simplex Projects Limited.

 We have drawn CMC officials attention to the unlawful activities in the area and urged them to take measures against the toughs, said B.K. Mundhra, the chairman of Simplex Projects, which had developed the parking lot and plaza on a build-operate-transfer basis.

 A civic engineer, who did not want to be named, said Simplex has threatened to give up the responsibility of maintaining the plaza if the toughs are not reined in.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has asked municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to take up the matter with police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 A civic official said the authorities have identified two goons Langra and Hatkata as the kingpins of the illegal parking racket.

 The entire stretch of Lindsay Street in front of the New Market Clock Tower has been turned into a pedestrian plaza. A 10-ft-wide corridor beside it connects Jawaharlal Nehru Road with Free School Street.

 Local toughs, in an attempt to take over the place, have been encouraging pavement-dwellers to bathe in the waterbody on the premises.

 Last week, a guard of Simplex Projects was beaten up by the toughs when he tried to stop the pavement-dwellers from bathing in the tank. A complaint was lodged with New Market police station.

 Municipal commissioner Bandyopadhyay said: A parking zone for two-wheelers is being set up on Fenwick Bazar Street, as the underground facility does not allow such vehicles to park.

 Parking of cars on Fenwick Bazar Street, Bertram Street and Lindsay Street will soon be banned. Licences of the parking lots on these streets have expired and they will not be renewed, said Bandyopadhyay.

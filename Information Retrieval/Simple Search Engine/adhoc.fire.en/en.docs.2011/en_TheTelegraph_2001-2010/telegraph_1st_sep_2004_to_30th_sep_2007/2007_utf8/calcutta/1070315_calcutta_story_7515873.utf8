 Ads defaced for tax dues

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic authorities have cracked down on defaulter outdoor advertisement agencies by defacing their billboards.

 Since Friday, 162 billboards have been defaced by the advertisement department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). The drive will continue, asserted mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 He urged companies to ask for the CMCs no-due certificate from advertising agencies before hiring their billboards. 

 Bhattacharyya also directed civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to take similar action against shop signs used for product promotion by various companies.

 There are around two dozen outdoor advertising agencies in the city. The billboards total 4,836, of which 2,300 are on private land and 1,900 on CMC plots.

 The civic authorities have sent demand notices amounting to Rs 30 crore to the agencies for 2006-2007. But only Rs 13 crore have been deposited.

 Criticising the CMC move, Dilip Chatterjee of Selvel, an outdoor advertising agency, said: The civic body is not just defacing the name of the agency, but also that of the company that has hired the billboard... If the demand notices have not been realised in full, the slackness of the civic authorities is to be blamed.

 Joint civic commissioner Ashis Kumar Thakur, however, said: The agencies have collected the entire amount from the companies in advance, yet they are not paying their dues to the CMC. By defacing the billboards, we want to send a message to the clients of the agencies.

 The CMC collects visual tax from all billboards. For those that have been put up on CMC land, an additional land charge is also levied.

 The annual earning from a billboard on CMC land is around Rs 2.67 lakh and from a billboard on private land, Rs 75,000. An official said the civic coffers would be richer by Rs 20 crore if the 1,000-odd illegal billboards, on private land and rooftops, could be brought within the visual tax net.

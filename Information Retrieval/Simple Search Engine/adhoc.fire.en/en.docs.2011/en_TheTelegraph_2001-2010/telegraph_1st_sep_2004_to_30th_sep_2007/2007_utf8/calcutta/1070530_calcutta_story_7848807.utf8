The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cop brokers ransom for kickback

 - Cooks brother abducted by creditor, thana adds commission for release 

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Your younger brother is with us. Pay Rs 11,000 at Taltala police station and take him away. This threat call from a cop meant that Chandrakant Nayak had landed from the frying pan into the fire. 

 It came three hours after his younger brother was abducted from South Club where Chandrakant runs the canteen on Tuesday morning.

 A gang of youths had stormed the cradle of tennis in Calcutta around 11 am, brushed aside the durwan and raided the kitchen in search of 30-year-old Chandrakant, for some money he owed a meat shop-owner. With their target not in sight, they collared his younger brother Pappu, 19, dragged him out of the club and into a taxi, and fled.

 When Chandrakant learnt of his brothers abduction, he rushed to Bhowanipore police station to lodge an FIR. But officer-on-duty S.S. Roy asked him to wait. Chandrakant then got a call from Aslam Khan, owner of a meat shop in Taltala, informing him that Pappu was at Taltala police station, and that he would be released on a payment of Rs 11,000.

 I told the officer about the call. He called up Taltala police station, refused to lodge my complaint and gave me a number, telling me to speak to someone in Taltala thana, said Chandrakant.

 It was the number of A. Mallik, an officer of Taltala police station, who ordered the South Club kitchens cook-cum-manager to cough up Rs 11,000 and take away his brother. Chandrakant reached Taltala police station and found Pappu sitting on a bench and Aslam chatting with a policeman.

 The officer asked me to pay Rs 11,000 or else he would put me behind bars. I pleaded with him that I owed Aslam Rs 7,000 and would pay him by June 1. He insisted I pay by cheque if I didnt have the cash, said Chandrakant. He and his brother were finally allowed to leave the thana after promising to pay up by June 1. I owe Aslam Rs 7,000 but the policeman has ordered me to pay Rs 11,000. Is this not extortion? cried Chandrakant.

 Mallik told Metro he just wanted to help poor Aslam, who was being cheated by Chandrakant. I do not know whether Aslam and his men had forcibly brought his brother here, he argued.

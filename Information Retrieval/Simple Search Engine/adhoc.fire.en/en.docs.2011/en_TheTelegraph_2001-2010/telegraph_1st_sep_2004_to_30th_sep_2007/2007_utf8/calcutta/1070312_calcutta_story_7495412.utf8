 Films and feminism

 Driven by the strong belief that cinema has an impact on the promotion of gender sensitivity, the 2nd India International Women Film Festival was held in New Delhi last December. It made effective use of the narrative of cinema to make women and their problems more visible, to create a milieu to further discussions on gender and gender discrimination as well as to encourage the role of women in the world of cinema. Look Back 2nd IIWFF 06, a package of 21 award-winning films from the festival, will be screened in the city specially for its cinema-loving audience. To be inaugurated today at 6.30 pm, there will be three screenings each day at 3, 5 and 7 pm. The inaugural days screening features Unwanted Woman (direction: Tahmineh Milani; at 5 pm). Set in modern-day Iran, Milanis hotly-debated film Unwanted Woman (a scene from the film appears right) explores themes of sexism and censorship in a society that consistently seems to devalue its women.

 lEvent: A festival of award-winning films by women filmmakers lWhen: March 12 - 17 lWhere: Gorky Sadan, 3 Gorky Terrace

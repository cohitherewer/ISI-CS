 Cyclist mowed down

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 28-year-old cyclist died after an unidentified vehicle knocked him down in New Town on Friday morning.

 The mishap took place on the Salt Lake-to-airport stretch of New Town Road, near Narkelbagan. Residents of the area said Bivas Chakrabarty was being forced to cycle down the middle of the road to avoid potholes when he was hit.

 Chakrabarty was returning to his Cossipore home after night duty at a local construction site. Since very few buses ply on the road, it seems that a car hit him before speeding away. This happened around 9am, said a senior officer of Rajarhat police station.

 The residents informed the police after finding Chakrabarty lying on the road in a pool of blood. He was taken to Salt Lake sub-divisional hospital, where he was declared brought dead.

 The stretch of the road near the accident spot is in very bad shape. We have repeatedly asked Hidco and the local panchayat authorities to look into the problem. We risk our life while taking the road, especially at night, said Asim Mondal, a resident of the area.

 Woman saved at station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An 80-year-old deranged widow could have walked into a disaster on Thursday, had not a group of unidentified people come to her rescue.

 Ranibala Das (name changed on request) disappeared from her house in New Alipore around 1 pm. Later, she was found walking dangerously along the railway tracks at Ballygunge station.

 Some people dragged her away from the tracks and contacted us, said Nitaidas Mukherjee, executive director of HIVE India, an NGO.

 She was looking dazed, but managed to give us some clues about her family. We took help from police to locate her home and reunite her with her sons, he added.

 She seemed to be suffering from some mental disturbances. Our probe revealed that she took a train from New Alipore and reached Ballygunge, said a police officer.

 Ranibala lives with her four sons and their families. She is suffering from various geriatric illnesses, said Rabin, one of the sons.

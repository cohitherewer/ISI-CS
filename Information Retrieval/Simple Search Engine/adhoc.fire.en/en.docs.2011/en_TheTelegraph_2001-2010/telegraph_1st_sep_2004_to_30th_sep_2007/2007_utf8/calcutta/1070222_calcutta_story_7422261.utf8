 Celestial treats in March

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A total lunar eclipse in progress

 Sky-watchers in the city will be treated to twin eclipses next month.

 A total lunar eclipse, the first celestial event of 2007, will take place early on March 4. On March 19, the city will witness a partial solar eclipse.

 The total eclipse will start at 3 am. The phenomenon will be most pronounced from 4.50 am to 5.27 am. The end of the eclipse will not be visible from the city, since the moon will set around 6 am.

 The sky permitting, it will be a wonderful opportunity for residents of the city to view a total eclipse. The next lunar eclipse will also be a total one, on August 28. The partial phase of the eclipse will only be visible from the north-eastern states, said Debiprosad Duari, director (research and academics) MP Birla Planetarium.

 The partial solar eclipse will be visible from most places in India. For city residents, the day will start with the eclipse. 

 The Sun will rise around 5.45 am and the eclipse will begin at 6.11 am. The eclipse will be most pronounced around 7 am, when almost 42 per cent of the Suns disc will be covered by the Moon. The eclipse will end around 7.50 am in the city. 

 Calcuttans will have to wait for a long time for another solar eclipse. The next solar eclipse will occur in 2009 and will be visible only in the northern parts of Bengal, stated Duari.

 The lunar eclipse can be watched through the naked eye, but people should avoid staring at the Moon for a long time, he said. The partial solar eclipse should not be watched without taking precaution. 

 Since one eclipse will occur at the dead of the night and the other early in the morning, we could not make special arrangements at the planetarium. Calcuttans can watch both events without the help of telescope or binocular, Duari said.

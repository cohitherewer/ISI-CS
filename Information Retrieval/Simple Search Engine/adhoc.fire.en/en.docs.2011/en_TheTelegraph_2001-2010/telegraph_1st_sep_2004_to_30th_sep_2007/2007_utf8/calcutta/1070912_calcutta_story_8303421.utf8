 Mozart revisited

 For the Signum Quartett from Germany, the magic of Mozarts music is the reflection of eternity in life. Their music is strongly influenced by their will to express, combining youthful fire, excellent ensemble playing and intelligent thoughts, to present gripping chamber music. This evening, the group presents a concert that juxtaposes works by Schumann and Haydn, along with the world premiere recording of Jrg Widmanns first string quartet. Members of the Signum Quartett will explain and highlight aspects of String Quartet No.1 (1997) by Widmann to further enhance listening pleasure. Signum Quartett will perform Haydns String Quartet in D, op 76, No.5 (1797) and Schumanns String Quartet in A, op 41, 3 (1842). Members: Kerstin Dill and Annette Walther (violin), Simon Tandree (viola) and Thomas Schmitz (cello). Hosted by Goethe-Institut and Calcutta School of Music.

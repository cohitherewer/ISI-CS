 In step with Kathak

 Madhumita Roy is a well-known name in the field of Kathak dance. A senior disciple of Pandit Birju Maharaj, she has performed all over India as well as abroad. Her choreographed works have also received favourable critical acclaim. This evening, she presents some of her own compositions based on Kathak, along with members of her Kathak ensemble, Ghungroo. An innovative piece, Bandish Fusion, blends kheyal bandish with western rhythms. Angikam embodies the emphasis given in Kathak to stylised gestures of the body. This choreography demonstrates various synchronised movements of the feet, hands and eyes. A portrait of Lord Shiva in all his attributes, Tandav is also based on western rhythms. Also, the launch of Madhumita Roys Kathak Shiksha Darshan (a set of three VCDs for advanced students of Kathak, showcasing its modern and traditional forms) by celebrated danseuse Priti Patel.

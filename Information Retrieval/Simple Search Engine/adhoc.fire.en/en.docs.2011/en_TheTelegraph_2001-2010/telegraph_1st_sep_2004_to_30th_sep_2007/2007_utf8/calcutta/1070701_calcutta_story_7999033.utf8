 Middle path to balance

 Mark Tully shares lessons from Indian religions with the world in his latest book, reports Chandrima S. Bhattacharya

 Mark Tully calls his latest book Indias Unending Journey. There are no full stops in India, as he had proclaimed before, and now he chooses to travel down the road, sometimes through well-known city roads, sometimes through dusty village tracks, between the Left and the Right, between religious fundamentalists and secular fundamentalists (and also free will fundamentalists of the West), because in India, he says, he has found the middle path. Madhyam pantha, the classic Indian strategy. 

 Along the road, Tully, a devout Christian who had once trained to become an Anglican priest, says he has picked up lessons that he wants to share with the world, particularly with the West. Especially lessons from Indias religions. The 40 years he has spent in India, says the veteran journalist, who headed BBC in India for 22 years, has taught him mostly that the West can learn from the Indian religions the acknowledgement that there are limits to certainties. And theres a balance in everything. Finding a balance in a time of change is the sub-title of the book. 

 to me, the Indian tradition has come to imply that in everything in life we should seek to be balanced, and that the quest for balance never ends. And, I believe that the Indian tradition of argument and discussion (here he acknowledges his debt to Amartya Sen and the Upanishadic edict of neti, neti) provides a way forward between the rock of dogmatic modernism and the hard stone of post-modernism.

 To illustrate dogma, he chooses the words ascribed to Jesus: I am the way, the truth and the light, and adds that in the past Christianity has claimed to be dogmatic. But such a claim cannot be made of Hinduism, because it is tolerant, pluralistic, like Buddhism, and the people who practise the current dogmatic version of Hinduism, Hindutva, if it can be called that, like Praveen Togadia, are stray individuals. Though he personally believes that dogmatism is contrary to the spirit of Christianity, too. 

 But where does he see this tolerance, this balance, this dogma-free discourse happening in India now, also said to be suffering from a million mutinies for decades? Neti, neti? Tully locates his sources in the texts, in religious practices, in swamis he came across in Hrishikesh, in practising, thinking Hindus, who include many of his friends, in yoga.

 He met Swami Veda Bharati in Hrishikesh, who has to his credit a book called God. It says: God, for me, is truth, and truth is that which exists in all times the past, present and future. Mahesh Yogi may have said the same to the Beatles. 

 However, one cant fight with faith. And thats what Tully has. And that, despite the book often reading like another guide to India for the foreign tourist do not be deceived by external realities, riots, poverty, inside, inherently, deep within, in its spiritual core, India is the country where a jaded Western soul still finds nourishment the book seems to holds. He explains the word juggernaut comes from Jagannath; he explains the Ambassador. But Tully doesnt chastise, he doesnt hector, he doesnt like the way The Big Fight is conducted on NDTV. He is gentle and dreamy. 

 The media invites extreme fundamentalists from opposing sides. They are allowed to say Hindus feel that, Muslims feel that. But I feel that these people in reality enjoy far less support, he says. Equally harmful are the secular fundamentalists. They dont realise they are fundamentalists. They think all religious people are illiberal. 

 The Wests rampant material culture has led to the decline of religion there Theres an anti-religious feeling in Europe , as if its all rubbish. And the very fact that Richard Dawkinss book Delusion of God is a bestseller says something. But doesnt he see the very things happening here too? Dawkins is also a bestseller in Tullys favoured country. 

 He puts it down to Western influence. India has been so deprived for so long that when the goodies are coming, its looking greedy. It is swept off its feet. But again, religion can be the answer. Indian religions opposed greed. Maybe traditional culture will help to combat Western materialism, says Tully softly. 

 Blessed is he.

 Helen Mirren and Forest Whitaker congratulating each other

 Helen Mirren of The Queen and Forest Whitaker of The Last King of Scotland won Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday as best lead players, their latest conquests on the road to the Academy Awards.

 The road-trip romp Little Miss Sunshine won the prize for best film ensemble, the guilds equivalent of a best-picture award.

 Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson won supporting-acting honours as soulful singers in Dreamgirls, reinforcing their status as Oscar front-runners.

 The Best Picture Oscar race, though, remains wide open, with The Queen and Little Miss Sunshine up against three sprawling dramas, The Departed, Babel and Letters From Iwo Jima.

 The guild category has never been a reliable forecast for how the big Oscars might play out. In the 11 years since the guild added the ensemble honour, only five winners have gone on to receive the Best Picture Oscar, including 2005s Crash.

 The guilds individual acting winners often line up with the Oscars, however. Three of the four guild winners for 2005 Philip Seymour Hoffman of Capote, Reese Witherspoon of Walk the Line and Rachel Weisz of The Constant Gardener all went on to receive Oscars, while all four guild acting winners for 2004 won at the Oscars.

 Whitaker, Mirren, Murphy and Hudson have dominated Hollywoods acting honours this awards season, all four also taking home Golden Globes.

 Mirren was diplomatic backstage when asked if she wants the Oscar. Im not going there right now, Mirren said. But its been the most incredible year for me, ever. Thats been amazing at this end of my life.

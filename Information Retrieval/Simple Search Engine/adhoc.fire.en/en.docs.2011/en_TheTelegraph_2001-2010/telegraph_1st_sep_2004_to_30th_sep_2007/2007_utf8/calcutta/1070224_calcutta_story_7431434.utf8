 Vignettes of a city

 Renowned for its literary, artistic and revolutionary heritage, Calcutta has also developed a unique modern identity adapted to contemporary cultures and trends. Caught between mellow traditions of the past and the more intense, urgent needs of the present, it offers an interesting mix of people with diverse perspectives, perceptions and practices. Aamar Kolkata, Tomar Kolkata, the ongoing exhibition of books, maps and sketches on Calcutta, portrays the essence of a city in the process of rapid change. The sketches, done by Samir Biswas in his inimitable style, capture some of the most remarkable sights of the city with his pen, ink, paint and brush. Discovering new and hitherto unknown facets of an old city, the artist has depicted in vivid detail the pulse of Calcutta, hidden in its innocuous lanes and bylanes or majestically announcing itself through massive symbols of urban development.

 lEvent: An exhibition of sketches by Samir Biswas and books and maps on Calcutta lWhen: Till February 24; 10.30 am - 9 pm lWhere: Starmark, G-202 City Centre, Salt Lake

 A red alert was sounded at railway stations in the state on Monday, following blasts on a train in Panipat. Security has been beefed up at the airport, too. The number of CISF personnel on duty has been increased, said an airport official.

 At Howrah and Sealdah stations, random checks were carried out throughout the day in long-distance trains. 

 Railway security officers held a meeting with the state government to assess the situation and exchange intelligence data. Railway Protection Force and Government Railway Police (GRP) are conducting checks at both stations. 

 Three sniffer dogs have been deployed at the stations. Another 25 will be deployed soon, said an Eastern Railway spokesperson. The railways disaster management team has been put on alert, said an official. 

 The number of plainclothesmen as well as men in uniform deployed at major stations has been increased, said GRP superintendent (Howrah) Pradip Sanyal. The compartments of major trains, including the Rajdhani Express, are being scanned with metal detectors before departure.

 However, according to sources, the security is not adequate at Sealdah station due to shortage of GRP officers. We do not have enough staff members to upgrade security, said a GRP officer.

 Surveillance cameras have also been installed at the stations. The passengers luggage are being scanned at the stations as well as on trains.

 Metro Railway officials said there has been an alert at the stations since the London underground blast last year.

 The explosions also prompted Calcutta Police to intensify vigil within the city and at its entry and exit points.

 People moving around suspiciously are being detained, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) P.K. Chatterjee. Officers of the Radio Flying Squad have been asked to intercept vehicles to verify papers. Officers of the special branch, the city polices intelligence wing, have been deployed at sensitive spots.

 All the police stations have been put on alert, said a senior officer at Lalbazar. 

 10 years RI: Feroz Khandekar and Mohammad Siddiqui were sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment on Monday for robbing fashion designer Anamika Khanna in April 2000. A detective department officer said the criminals had held Anamika at gunpoint in the corridor of her third-floor office on Hazra Road and snatched her briefcase containing Rs 2 lakh. The two were hired by Abdul Rehman, alias Abdul Rajesh, of Akra, in South 24-Parganas. Rehman, wanted in several murder and extortion cases, is still at large.

 The City Diary

 Justice K.J. Sengupta of the high court on Tuesday directed the chairman of the board that publishes Guinness Book of World Records to be present before the court within 10 weeks and clarify why contempt proceedings should not be started against him for flouting an order. 

 The court had earlier directed the board to include the names of Saloo Chowdhury and Neena Chowdhury as the worlds first and fastest circumnavigator on a four-wheeler. The court order followed a petition by the Chowdhurys, who alleged that the board had violated the first order. 

 The Second Vivekananda Bridge will be opened to traffic at noon on Wednesday. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, however, expressed unhappiness over the fact that several related works, like installation of the signalling system and curbing unauthorised parking, are not yet complete.

 The jail department has purchased four buses to ferry inmates of Presidency jail to court and hospital. The procurement follows unavailability of police jeeps for carrying the inmates, a jail official said on Tuesday.

 A five-year-old boy and a youth drowned in separate accidents on Tuesday. Sheikh Jahid, 5, a resident of Pottery Road, in Entally, slipped into a pond in Convent Lane while playing around 4.30pm. In the other incident, Gunjan Sinha, 20, a student of a hotel management institute in Salt Lake, drowned in a pond near his mess in Jadavpur. The bodies were sent for post-mortem.

 Michel Rocard, a former Prime Minister of France who is being treated at CMRI hospital, may be released later this week, a hospital official said on Tuesday. Rocard, 76, on a cultural trip to Calcutta, was admitted to CMRI after suffering a brain haemorrhage on Saturday.

 Bharat Sevashram Sangha will organise a month-long free medical relief camp at Pahalgaon, in Jammu and Kashmir, for Amarnath Yatra pilgrims.

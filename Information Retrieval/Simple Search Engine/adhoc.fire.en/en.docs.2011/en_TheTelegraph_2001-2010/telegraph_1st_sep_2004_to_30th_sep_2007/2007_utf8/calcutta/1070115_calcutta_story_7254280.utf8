The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech options for your television, decoded

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 As government and private players eye a pie in the small-screen sky, the consumer who is meant to be crowned king, now finds himself caught in the cables of confusion.

 Metro clears the air and explores what you will get on your TV for what you pay:

 CAS

 Service providers: Manthan Broadband, CableComm, Indian Cablenet, Siticable, Srishti, and Kolkata Cable and Broadband Pariseva.

 Area of operation: Alipore, New Alipore, Behala, Chetla, Budge Budge, Garden Reach, parts of Thakurpukur, Tollygunge, Haridevpur and Mahestala (Phase I). Subsequently, all areas under CMDA. 

 What you need to do: Get in touch with your local cable operator and apply for conditional access system (CAS). An agreement with the multi-system operator (MSO) has to be signed, following which a set- top box (STB) is delivered.

 Installation charge: Either buy the STB or opt for the rental scheme, according to TRAI guidelines. The STB price is Rs 2,000-Rs 3,000, depending on make and capacity.

 Rental scheme means paying Rs 999 and Rs 250 during installation with a monthly rental of Rs 30 and Rs 45, respectively. After five years, the STB becomes the subscribers property. (Monthly rental would vary, depending on the number of channels subscribed.)

 The technology: Digital signals of pay channels are encrypted, passed through a subscriber management system (SMS) software with subscriber-specific information and then distributed through the cable network already in place. The digital signal is then decoded into video signals by the STB and transferred to the television set.

 Each STB has a smart card inserted that activates the device and is programmed with a unique IP address that interacts with software, allowing the subscriber access only to channels he has opted for. 

 (The STB may not match the frequency if shifted to a different location in the city and the subscriber has the option to return the device to the MSO at a devalued price.) 

 Pay to view: TRAI has fixed a monthly subscription fee of Rs 77 for the bouquet of a minimum of 35 free-to-air (FTA) channels. Pay channels picked by the subscriber come at a maximum retail price of Rs 5.30 each, inclusive of taxes. (The rate per channel is expected to climb down.) 

 DTH

 Service providers: Tata Sky and Dishtv. (Reliance and Sun expected to launch DTH services later this year.) 

 Area of operation: Across the city. 

 What you need to do: Call up customer service cells of the direct-to-home (DTH) service providers. (All numbers are not toll-free).

 Tata Sky has two numbers 19014256633 and 04066006633 with several parallel lines. The companys website can be accessed at www.tatasky.com.

 Dishtv customer care numbers are 19011803474 and 01204443474. The service provider also has an SMS service. You can visit the website at www.dishtvindia.in.

 Installation charge: The small dish and STB with installation charge and a one-year guarantee on maintenance are Tata Sky Rs 3,999; Dishtv Rs 3,150.

 The technology: The small dish fixed on the terrace, balcony or the window sill receives digital signal through a specific frequency directly from the satellite and transmits it through a cable to the STB. 

 The box decodes it into video signal and passes it on to the television set. 

 Pay to view: Tata Sky offers 108 channels for Rs 300 a month. (A promotional offer with six-month waiver of monthly rentals for those signing up by end-January.)

 Dishtv has introduced Dish Maxi and Dish Welcome. Maxi offers 125 channels (93 pay channels and 32 free-to-air) for a monthly fee of Rs 300. Welcome offers 85 channels (53 pay and 32 free-to-air) for Rs 262 per month.

 IPTV

 Service provider: BSNL.

 Area of operation: Across the city. 

 What you need to do: If you are an existing broadband subscriber, you will get the Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) system from April. If you are not, visit your local BSNL telephone exchange and apply for broadband services. Once that is in place, you will be able to avail of IPTV.

 Installation charge: Nil.

 The technology: IPTV uses a digital broadcast signal sent through a switched telephone-cum-broadband network. Like in CAS and DTH, a STB decodes the signals and converts it into standard television signals. The technology is known as Triple Play as data, video and voice signals are sent through the same cable.

 Pay to view: 100 channels for a monthly rental of Rs 200 or less.

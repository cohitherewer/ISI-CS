 One crushed by killer bus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 One person was crushed to death and three persons were injured by a speeding bus on route 201 near BD block, in Salt Lake, on Tuesday morning.

 Tarun Pande, 24-year-old resident of CA block, was killed by the Karunamoyee-bound bus. He was crossing the road when the bus hit him. He died on the spot. The mishap occurred around 10 am.

 The injured included a rickshaw passenger. They were rushed to a nearby hospital and discharged later.

 According to police, the mishap occurred when a rickshaw came in front of the speeding bus. 

 The driver tried to save the rickshaw and swerved the bus in the opposite direction. Pande was knocked down. The bus driver fled the spot, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 Local residents blamed rash driving for the fatal mishap. The bus driver was in a hurry. He lost control of the vehicle, said Amal Chatterjee, a witness. 

 Enraged passengers and pedestrians tried to set the bus on fire and blocked the road near BD block for more than half an hour. A large police force from Bidhannagar (North) police station was rushed to the spot and the agitators were dispersed. 

 Local residents said traffic police in the township were callous and unruly autorickshaws and buses were a death risk on the roads. 

 Expressing concern, Salt Lake municipality chairman Biswajiban Majumdar held out the assurance: We will ask the cops to ensure proper traffic management in the township.

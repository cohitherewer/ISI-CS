 Oratorical milestones

 Speeches are meant to be delivered and heard. A good orator brings to a speech something more persuasive and moving than the power of the written word. Certain speeches in Indian history over the last 100 years are timeless in their emotive charge. To commemorate six decades of Indian independence, Random House India and Oxford Bookstore Calcutta present the launch of Great Speeches of Modern India. Edited by Rudrangshu Mukherjee, the book brings together some of the most seminal, outstanding and unforgettable speeches made in India from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 21st, speeches that retain their power as written texts. Having changed the nations political tide, these inspiring and instructive speeches tell the story of modern India; from the countrys move to independence and the battles thereafter. Featuring speeches by W.C. Bonerjee, Lord Curzon, Swami Vivekananda, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose, B.R. Ambedkar, Jayprakash Narayan, Indira Gandhi, J.R.D. Tata, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other distinguished personalities. Following the launch, Mukherjee will speak on What the history books dont teach you a look at the history of modern India through its speeches. Krishna Bose will introduce and narrate Subhash Chandra Boses famous address in 1944, Give me blood and I promise you freedom....

 Fresh feel to bridal bonanza

 ; Madhabilata flaunts a sari by Arnab Sen Gupta

 The 11th edition of Bridal Asia, the annual wedding extravaganza, will be hosted by Delhi next week. While some of the bigwigs of Indian fashion will showcase their creations through fashion shows on January 10 and 11, the exhibition from January 13 to 15 will see a mix of big names and upcoming talent.

 Twenty-six young designers from Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Jaipur and Lucknow will be part of the youth brigade at the Bridal Asia 2007. Among the Calcutta youngsters are designers Abhishek Dutta, Minaxi Dadoo and Arnab Sen Gupta.

 GoodLife checks out what the trio has lined up for the bridal bonanza.

 The complete trousseau collection by Abhishek Dutta not only features designs for the bride and groom, but for the to-be couples new home as well.

 Home furnishings cushions, cushion covers, bedspreads, pillow cases and table linen in keeping with the wedding theme, find a place in Abhisheks line. The look of the collection is metallic with gold, silver and copper emphasis. Foil print and leather patches embellish the pieces.

 The bridal line is all about drapes. The highlight of the collection is the variety of saris. Pleats play an important role in the whole collection, smiles Abhishek. There are easy-to-wear saris like pre-pleated ones, ruched saris, kalidaar saris, fanpalla saris, sheer net saris worn over lehngas, and more. The lehngas are embellished with Swarovski and often come with pleated borders.

 The shades, surprisingly, are pastel ivory, beige, pistachio, peach, powder blue with sudden splashes of shocking pink and red. Pearls, hand embroidery and Swarovski embellish the clothes. Georgettes, nets, velvets and suedes are the fabrics used. 

 The mens wear collection boasts of sherwanis and prince coats with western cuts and antique finish. While the palette is muted dull magenta and peach, mostly the pieces use the same kind of embellishments as the womens line, with a liberal sprinkling of pearls.

 Diffusion do

 Young designer Minaxi Dadoo will be participating in Bridal Asia for the second consecutive year, and is drawing from her experience at the exhibition in October 2004. People not only look out for bridal wear at the exhibition, they want to buy everything that can be part of the trousseau. So, apart from my bridal line, I will be taking a diffusion collection as well, she reveals.

 The bridal line features saris and lehngas in rich, jewel colours. Burgundy, wine, maroon, browns, chocolate, olive, pistachio and dull pinks colour the ensembles, which are embellished with loads of gold and glitter. The look is vintage and antique and the work is in mul and gold. The fabrics focus on lots of silks, satins, georgettes and velvets.

 The diffusion line bears the ethnic essence, with a touch of international styles. The jackets and kurtas flaunt matte gold prints. The kurtas are mostly high-waisted, in keeping with the trend, often with broad belts. They have lots of volume and layers, too, adds Minaxi. 

 Appliques and Kutch embroidery decorate this range. A highlight of the entire collection is the use of betel leaf motifs in different forms. 

 Fantasy fetish

 Arnab Sen Guptas collection for Bridal Asia is inspired by fantasy movies. There are some very unexpected elements like the combination of contrasting fabrics and unusual colours, explains Arnab.

 So, there are polka dots, animal prints and chiffon highlights in a lehnga, while traditional maroons and golds are paired with lime green and navy blue. Lehngas, saris, jackets, tunics, salwar kameez and skirts make up the collection.

 There is a combination of different kinds of embroidery 15 to 20 kinds of aari work, zardosi in the style of the Nizam of Hyderabad, Jaipuri gota, mukaish work and more. 

 Each lehnga features at least 15 to 20 different types of embroidery. Since there will be buyers from Pakistan and Dubai, apart from India, my collection has an element of conservatism about it, adds Arnab.

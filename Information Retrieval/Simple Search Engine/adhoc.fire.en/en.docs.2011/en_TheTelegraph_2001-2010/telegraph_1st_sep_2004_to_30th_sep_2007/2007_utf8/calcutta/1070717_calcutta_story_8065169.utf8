 On Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Chen Khoi Kui wraps up work in his Tangra tannery and heads home early. From 9pm to 10pm, the entire Chen clan is glued to the television, cellphones in hand.

 Ann Lee is an entrepreneur in Peter Lane of central Calcutta. Her hectic schedule churning out sauce bottles by the dozen comes to a halt for that magic hour, Thursday to Saturday, when one young man takes centrestage.

 The 6,000-strong Chinese community in Calcutta mostly Chinatown in Tangra and Tiretta Bazaar in central Calcutta has found a new hero. Meiyang Chang, in the race to be Indian Idol 3.

 The 24-year-old dentist from Dhanbad has made it to the Top 10 of the reality show on Sony. And Calcuttas Chinese families would like to believe that Chang is on song powered by their SMS votes.

 Changs mother has petitioned the Chinese community in Calcutta to rally behind her son. We have promised Changs mother that we will do our best to make him the Indian Idol. After all, he is our brother. We have put up his pictures and posters and banners all over Tangra and mini Chinatown in central Calcutta, urging people to vote for Meiyang Chang. We are all voting for him, says Chen Khoi Kui, secretary of the South Tangra Chinese Youth Club.

 Once Chang reaches the first five we will step up our campaign. We will urge every Chinese in Calcutta to put up his picture in homes, shops and other work spaces, adds Chen.

 The buzz generated by Indian Idol or rather the presence of Chang on it is impossible to miss in Tangra.

 GenX gangs are busy making banners and posters that would finally make their way to the walls of the locality, all urging people to vote for Chang. He is definitely our idol, smiles Ah Tan, putting up one such banner on Matheshwar Tala Road.

 Changs popularity cuts across socio-economic boundaries. Kuchi Moy sells Chinese breakfast at Poddar Court in the mornings. He has been cutting corners for the past few weeks, so that he can use that extra cash to buy top-up cards to SMS his vote for Chang.

 In the past two years of Indian Idol, I have seen how every SMS counts. People from every region vote for their local candidate. I know that we are very few in number but we want to vote for Chang and make him win the contest. It would be a matter of pride if a Chinese becomes the next Indian Idol, declares Moy.

 Not just the Chinese, people from other communities should also vote for Chang because of his courage to participate in a Hindi film music reality show, adds Ann Lee.

 On the show, Chang has won applause for his voice and charming smile. Judge Anu Malik has praised Changs magical voice and backed him to make the first five.

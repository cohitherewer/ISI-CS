The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 March 08 date for Metro 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A trip on the Tollygunge-Garia Metro Railway will have to wait another year. 

 And trains will only ply at 30-minute interval even after the project is completed because of land-acquisition problems at the proposed New Garia station slowing down commissioning.

 On Wednesday, Metro authorities announced March next year as the tentative deadline for the inauguration of Metro services on the Tollygunge-Garia extension. The project is worth around Rs 908 crore.

 The service on the extended section will be launched with trains plying from Tollygunge to Briji (Pranab Nagar). The opening of the New Garia station will be delayed because of land-acquisition problems.

 According to Metro Railway general manager Sudha M. Chobe, the physical work of the project is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

 Due to land-acquisition problems we cannot immediately commission the New Garia station, stated the general manager. 

 Trains will ply between Tollygunge and Briji, with stations at Kudghat, Bansdroni, Naktala and Garia Bazar in between, at 30-minute interval.

 The long interval is due to lack of space for trains to turn around quickly and commence on the return journey.

 The trains were supposed to start on the return journey from New Garia station.

 A senior Metro Railway official explained: Every fourth train from Dum Dum, during rush hour, and every third train from Dum Dum, at other times, will go up to Briji. But we cannot send all Up trains to Briji because it will slow down the entire network, causing immense problems for commuters in other parts. 

 In 2006-07, the Metro Railway ferried 114.81 million passengers. The previous fiscal, it had ferried 107.87 million passengers. The yearly passenger growth was 6.43 per cent.

 The state government is planning a ferry service between Babughat and Dakshineswar. 

 The trustee board of Dakshineswar temple had approached the transport department for starting the service. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has agreed in principle to the proposal.

 Also on the anvil is a halt at Dakshineswar station by long-distance trains.

 If the ferry service is started, pilgrims will not have to be stuck in traffic snarls on BT Road or GT Road on their way to Dakshineswar from the city, pointed out an official of the traffic department 

 RJD legislator of Burrabazar Md Sohrab has decided to request railway minister Lalu Prasad, who heads the party, to direct the railway authorities to stop long-distance trains plying along the central chord railway (CCR) link via Vivekananda bridge at Dakshineswar station.

 Sohrab is in touch with the board of trustees of the temple in this respect.

 Long-distance trains like the Darjeeling Mail and the Jammu Tawi Express used to stop at Dakshineswar station. The railway authorities discontinued the practice suddenly. I will take up the matter with railway minister Lalu Prasad, said Sohrab.

 According to trustee and secretary of Dakshineswar temple and debutter estate Kushal Chowdhury, President Rajendra Prasad had ordered all trains passing through to stop at Dakshineswar as a mark of respect to the temple. 

 A Rs 10-crore project, funded by the Union ministry of tourism, is now underway to showcase the heritage and historical aspects of the temple in a better manner. 

 The board of trustees has also taken up a scheme to showcase Shanti Kuthi, Panchamundi, where Ramakrishna Paramahansa had practised tantra, and Gazipith, where he had observed rituals of Islam, stated Chowdhury.

 Our objective is to make the temple campus as it was during the time of Ramakrishna Paramahansa. With that end in mind, we have taken up a programme to re-plant trees and greenery on the basis of information available in historical documents, added the temple secretary.

 What is the price that two Trinamul Congress councillors must pay for assaulting and humiliating a municipal engineer?

 A date with the investigating officer of Phoolbagan police station twice a week, till further orders.

 A day after the vandalism in the Narkeldanga Borough III office, Swapan Samaddar and Sunanda Guha along with local party leader Apu Mukherjee were granted bail by the additional chief judicial magistrate of Sealdah court.

 The one small rider is that the Trinamul leaders who had led a group of supporters to garland the boroughs executive engineer, Sudipto Chattopadhyay, with shoes and cowdung cakes on Wednesday must go to Phoolbagan police station twice a week.

 The three Trinamul leaders were named by Chattopadhyay in the FIR. We booked them under eight sections of the IPC. They surrendered in court with a band of lawyers on Wednesday, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Samaddar and Guha refused to accept responsibility for the assault on the engineer. We did not ask anybody to garland the borough engineer. So, we take no responsibility for the incident, they told Metro.

 At the CMC headquarters, the day saw a deluge of deputations from senior engineers refusing to cooperate with Samaddar and Guha and demanding security.

 I had to face such barbarism... None of my colleagues should go through such a nightmare, said Chattopadhyay.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya called for a a code of conduct for councillors. By garlanding a civic official with cowdung cakes and shoes, they have not just insulted an individual but the institution, said the mayor.

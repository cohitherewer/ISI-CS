 Come July, pensioners and contractors will not need to queue up at the civic headquarters to facilitate their payment.

 The retired civic employees will have their pensions paid directly in the accounts they hold in banks near home.

 The contractors, on the other hand, will get to know details about the payment procedure, including the date of payment, from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation website.

 Both moves are part of the civic bodys capacity-building programme, being undertaken with a grant of Rs 212.25 crore from the British governments department for international development.

 Less crowd means less corruption, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. The new system will eliminate the scope of employees extorting money from contractors to expedite their payment.

 An insider said around Rs 1 lakh is paid as bribe daily by the 4,000-odd contractors who visit the civic headquarters daily to pursue their bills. The CMC has around 10,000 listed contractors.

 With the introduction of the electronic clearance system, they will not have to knock on the doors of various departments to get their bills cleared, said an official.

 As for pensioners, the payment now is made through United Bank of India and the Union Bank. But there have been frequent complaints of delay in the transfer of the money to the pensioners accounts. For those living in districts, the delay stretches up to a week, said Debotosh Dasgupta, chief of municipal finance and accounts.

 Under the new system, the civic body will convert the erstwhile salary accounts of retired employees into pension accounts in their local branches. This will ensure timely flow of money, added Dasgupta. The civic body pays contractors Rs 40 crore and pensioners Rs 5 crore every month.

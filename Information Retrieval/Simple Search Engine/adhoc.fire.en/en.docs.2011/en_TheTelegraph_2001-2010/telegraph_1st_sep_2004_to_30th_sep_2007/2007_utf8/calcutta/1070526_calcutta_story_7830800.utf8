 Tutor arrest for boy beating 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An 11-year-old boy was admitted to a nursing home on Friday after being allegedly beaten by his private tutor with a ruler for failing to answer a question. The tutor was arrested on Friday evening. 

 Vishal Dey, a Class VI student of St Stephens School and a resident of Motilal Colony near the airport, had gone for lessons to Swarmistha Deys house around 8.15pm on Thursday. When he failed to answer a question from a chapter he had been asked to read, Swarmistha allegedly hit him with a ruler.

 The bleeding and bruised boy returned home two hours later and narrated the incident to his father Mahadeb, an employee of the Airports Authority of India, before fainting. Vishal was taken to Dum Dum Municipal Hospital, where he was treated and discharged.

 He vomited blood at night and was admitted to a nursing home in Baguiati on Friday. 

 Swarmisthas mother admitted that her daughter had hit the child but said that she did not mean to injure him.

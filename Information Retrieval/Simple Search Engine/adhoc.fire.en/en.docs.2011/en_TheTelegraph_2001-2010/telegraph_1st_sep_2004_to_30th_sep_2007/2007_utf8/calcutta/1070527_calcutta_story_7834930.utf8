The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Bakkhali

 Fringed by casuarinas, Bakkhali is far from the madding crowd. It is the second most popular sea resort in Bengal. It takes only about four hours to reach Bakkhali from Calcutta.

 The journey is quite exciting, especially while one crosses the Hatania-Doania river. The bridge becomes a floating vessel that carries buses and other heavy vehicles on its back. 

 The beach, dotted with golden sand dunes, is full of broken trunks and logs that form patterns and shapes loved by the shutterbugs. Here nature is still unspoilt and unveils its beauty throughout the day.

 There are private hotels and holiday homes aplenty but the best option is probably the West Bengal Tourist Development Corporation bungalow. It has a swimming pool and a well-maintained flowerbed. Boating in the adjacent lake can be great fun for the family.

 During the day, dive into the Bay of Bengal or go for sightseeing. There is a reserved forest in the vicinity. Other attractions for the tourists are Engine Canal, deer park and the crocodile and turtle project.

 If you are in the mood for some explorations, ramble down to Frazergunj, only two kilometres from Bakkhali. Frazergunj got its name from that of Andrew Frazer, a British governor (Choto Lat).

 You can also take a motorboat to the island of Jammu Dweep. The trip is amazing. At the island, enjoy the sunrise in total solitude. In the evening, watch an enormous moon appear overhead.

 Bakkhali is ideal for a relaxing weekend. It is close to Calcutta but you can leave the city far behind at this resort.

 Plenty of CSTC as well as private buses ply from Calcutta to Bakkhali. The fare is around Rs 80

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Antonio Banderas

 You are pleasant, sociable and friendly. Versatile and spontaneous, you learn quickly and easily. You crave for diversity on the job. You never forget a favour or opportunity given to you. With your strong will and independent mind, you achieve what you want in relationships. You are a good administrator and treat others without malice.

 Kusum Bhandari

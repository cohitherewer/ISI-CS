 Court scan on teaching standards

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday asked the principal secretary of the state school education department to investigate the dismal performance in English by Higher Secondary candidates of a girls school. 

 Of the 142 candidates who appeared in the examination from Belghoria Vidyamandir, 107 failed in English. 

 Justice Biswanath Somadder expressed surprise at the number of unsuccessful candidates in the subject and asked principal secretary Nandita Chakraborty to find out the reason. She is to submit a report within four weeks.

 This is the first time a high court judge has directed the school education secretary to look into the poor performance by students of a school. While handling such cases, the court generally asks the HS council to produce answer scripts.

 The judges order is significant. He wants to know the standard of education provided at the school, according to a legal expert.

 The order was passed on the basis of a petition by Rupsha Chowdhury and 13 others from the school, who had failed in English in this years HS. 

 Advocate Ekramul Bari, who appeared for the students, told the court that 107 students could not have failed to secure pass marks in English. The court should ask the council to produce the answer scripts, he stated.

 The councils lawyer, Ranajit Chatterjee, told the court that his client was ready to furnish the answer scripts.

 The petitioners have also alleged that the council was not allowing them to fill up the forms for appearing in the compartmental examination in English as they had moved the court.

 Justice Somadder ordered the council to allow the petitioners to appear in the compartmental examination.

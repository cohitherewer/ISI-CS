 Kids in crime for a fast life 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Growing crime rackets in the city and its fringes are increasingly attracting teenagers and even children out of juvenile homes, according to police.

 Last Friday, six teenagers fled a home on Pottery Road to join the dark world of crime.

 We have rescued many teenagers and sent them to different homes. There are some teenagers who have acquired a criminal bent of mind and want to return to the gangs, said a senior officer of Entally police station.

 Most of these teenagers, who dabble in crime for excitement and quick money, usually find their way to various gangs operating in Sealdah, Kalighat, Maniktala, Park Circus, Chetla and Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city. 

 While some of them are engaged in picking pockets and stealing mobile phones, others hang around to learn the tricks of the trade, before starting on independent operations, said the officer.

 In Park Circus and Narkeldanga, children from Bihar and Chhattisgarh work with local ganglords and even end up becoming drug addicts at a tender age, the officer said.

 A few months ago, cops came across children involved in serious crimes while working on a series of robberies in parts of Loudon Street, Little Russell Street and Camac Street.

 In most cases, it turned out that a gang from Bihar was letting children slip into shops by lifting the shutters with crowbars. Since these children were lithe and small, they could easily move in and escape attention, said a senior officer of the detective department.

 There is a overwhelming sense of insecurity among a group of children who just dont want to return to their homes for various reasons. And at the same time, they want fast money to lead the kind of lives they see others of their age group from affluent homes living, said Veena Lakhumalani of Cini-Asha, a city-based NGO. 

 It could well be that this overwhelming sense of desire drives some to the world of crime, added Lakhumalani.

 We want to wean away such kids from crime, said Zulfikar Hassan, the joint commissioner of armed police. To give them a proper environment for living, we have started several programmes under Naba Disha scheme, added Hassan.

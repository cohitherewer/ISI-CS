 Court takes up plea against graft

 - Petitioner alleges extortion by staff

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Monday admitted a petition moved by a lawyer, Madan Lal, against the court administration for allegedly harassing litigants and their counsel seeking certified copies of orders.

 In response to the petition, which has made Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar chief respondent, the bench comprising Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice Tapas Giri asked the registrar (administration) to file a reply to the advocates allegations within two weeks.

 In his report, the registrar will have to explain the cause behind the delay in supplying certified copies of court orders, said Lal.

 Appearing for the court administration, advocate Aloke Ghosh submitted that as the petitioner is a lawyer of the high court, he should be treated as an officer of the judiciary. 

 An officer has no right to move such a case without taking permission from the high court administration, he pleaded.

 Lal has alleged in his petition that some dishonest employees of the court harass litigants and advocates while issuing certified copies of orders.

 The employees extract exorbitant amounts from lawyers for supplying certified copies. Litigants are the worst sufferers as the advocates realise the money from them.

 Citing an instance, the lawyer told the court that the certified copy of an interim order, delivered in December last year, is yet to be handed over to the litigants.

 In the absence of the certified copy, further hearings in the case could not be held, said Lal.

 The petitioner had first moved the case before a division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar.

 The petitioner has also sought modification in the Appellate Side Rules to bring about a uniformity in the fees required to be paid for obtaining certified copies. Uniformity in the fee structure will help prevent extortion by employees, Lal said.

 But the chief justice declined to hear the matter as he had been made the main respondent and assigned the case to the division bench of Justice Banerjee and Justice Giri.

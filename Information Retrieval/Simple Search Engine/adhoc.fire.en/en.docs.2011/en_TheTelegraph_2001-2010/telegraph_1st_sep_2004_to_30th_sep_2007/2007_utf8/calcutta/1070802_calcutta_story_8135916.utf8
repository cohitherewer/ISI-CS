 Dad, crowd catch girls molester

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 30-year-old man was arrested on charges of outraging the modesty of a college student in an autorickshaw in Lake Town on Wednesday morning. 

 Two days ago, a schoolgirl was allegedly harassed on a bus, but the accused had to be let off as the students parents withdrew the complaint.

 The accused in Wednesdays incident, Sanjay Soni, 30, had boarded the autorickshaw at the Lake Town-Jessore Road crossing, along with Piyali (name changed) and her father.

 According to the complaint, Sanjay started misbehaving with the girl soon after getting into the vehicle, said an investigating officer. 

 He was constantly pushing the girl and touching her hand. The girl asked him to sit properly, but he continued harassing her. Near the Lake Town crossing on VIP Road, he suddenly caught one of her hands, the officer added.

 As Piyali raised an alarm, her father slapped Sanjay and asked the driver to stop the vehicle. A crowd of around 70 people immediately gathered on the spot on hearing Piyalis cry for help, caught the man and beat him up, before handing him over to the Lake Town traffic guard.

 On being informed by the traffic guard about the incident, we rushed to the spot and arrested Sanjay. He will be produced in court on Thursday, said Ranjit Chakraborty, the officer-in-charge of Lake Town police station.

 Sanjay would have been lynched had we not reached there in time. He tried to flee after the autorickshaw stopped, but bystanders caught him, Chakraborty added.

 A preliminary probe revealed that the accused, married and the father of a four-year-old son, runs an advertising agency in Burrabazar and was on his way to office. He has been living with his family in Lake Town (Block A) for the past year.

 Piyali and her father were returning home to Belghoria after meeting a doctor in Lake Town.

 The man was sitting next to my daughter and misbehaving with her ever since we got into the autorickshaw. Perverts like him must be brought to book and dealt with sternly, said Piyalis father, who worked in a nationalised bank.

 Piyali was too shocked to react. Whatever I had to say, I told police, she said.

 Some of the women who were standing in a queue at the Lake Town autorickshaw stand said eve-teasing and molestation are regular occurrences on the route.

 At times, women are harassed even by the drivers. Piyali and her father did a commendable job, said Anju Malhotra, a resident of Lake Town.

 Eclectic images

 Bringing together contrasting individual styles that make for a delightful visual experience, Contemporary Perspectives, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, can also lend itself to serious study. Featuring still, figurative and abstract works, it offers an interesting mix that provides enough intellectual stimulus to the discerning art lover. Modern in theme and style of presentation, the works on show, nonetheless, make use of traditional symbolism. Animesh Nandi (a painting by him appears above) has portrayed a young woman with masterly skill. Though realistic, his faces appear enveloped in a halo of spirituality that gives them an ethereal and illusory quality. Biswajit Sahas life-like painting of a woman with a garland around her neck, attracts attention for its contrasting bright background. Tapas Konar, Atin Basak, Suman Roy and Asit Poddar are all unique in their stylistic treatment and subject interpretations. Soumitra Kars still-life representation of a vase reflects his preference for colliding conflicting perspectives.

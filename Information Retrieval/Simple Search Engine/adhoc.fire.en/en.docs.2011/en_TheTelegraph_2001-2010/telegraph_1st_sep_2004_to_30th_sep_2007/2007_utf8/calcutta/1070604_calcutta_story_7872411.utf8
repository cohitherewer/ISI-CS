 The City Diary

 As Calcutta continued to reel under a hot spell, Satyabrata Chakraborty, 63, died after he came to offer prayers at the Dakshineswar Kali temple on Sunday morning. The death occurred when he went to fetch water from the Hooghly after the puja. Police said after a preliminary investigation that Chakrabortys death could have been due to sunstroke. We found Chakrabortys address on a piece of paper in his shirt pocket. He was a resident of Madhugarh, in Dum Dum. There were a few hundred rupees and a packet of cigarettes, too, in the shirt pocket, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas). The police have informed his family and sent the body for post-mortem.

 fficials of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore said there was some uncertainty about the arrival of the monsoon in Calcutta and south Bengal districts, following the development of a cyclonic storm over the Arabian Sea over the past two days.

 The cyclonic storm will drag the monsoon current more along the western part of the country. What we need here now is a pre-monsoon depression or a cyclone in the east-central Bay of Bengal, which will help drag the monsoon to this part of the country, said a Met official.

 Sucharita Bhanja, a Madhyamik examinee, committed suicide by setting herself ablaze at her Barasat house, on the northern fringes of the city, as she had failed to obtain the pass marks.

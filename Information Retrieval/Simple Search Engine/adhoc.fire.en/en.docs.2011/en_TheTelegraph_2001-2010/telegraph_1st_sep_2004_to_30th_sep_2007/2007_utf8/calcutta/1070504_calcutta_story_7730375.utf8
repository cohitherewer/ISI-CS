 Twin thrust against offending hawkers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Calcutta Police have decided to seize the wares of hawkers violating the adopted norms. 

 The joint operation was decided on after mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay met police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim on Wednesday and sought action against the hawkers.

 Bhattacharyya pointed out that hawkers have been violating the adopted norms.

 According to the adopted stipulations, hawkers cannot encroach on more than one-third of a pavement, keep their structures on the pavement after business hours and cannot sit within 50 ft of road crossings. The policies were adopted last year.

 Problems like traffic congestion due to encroachment of roads and unauthorised parking were highlighted at the meeting. 

 We will take stringent action against offending hawkers this time. This is a warning to the hawkers. Anyone found guilty will be fined on the spot, said Shamim. 

 The deputy commissioner highlighted the chaotic traffic situation in areas like Burrabazar, Canning Street and NS Road, where hawkers have occupied the pavements and left no space for the pedestrians.

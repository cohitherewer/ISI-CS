 Move over middlemen, the Internets here to help artisans tap the potential of the global market this seems to be the new mantra of self-help groups working with craftsmen at the grassroots level.

 With middlemen appropriating the surplus of rural artisans who make products ranging from bamboo mattresses to candles, city-based associations have come forward to help them realise fair value of their produce by selling through websites.

 There is a huge demand for handicrafts within the country and, more importantly, abroad. Internet offers the best way of reaching out to the potential buyers. It will be a great help to artisans if they can avoid middlemen. Their earnings will go up by more than 100 per cent in certain cases, said Chanchal Sengupta, the co-ordinator of Silence, an NGO working with handicapped craftsmen.

 The issue came up for discussion at a seminar held in Calcutta last week. It was attended by representatives of 65 NGOs and self-help groups that work with craftsmen from northern and eastern parts of the country. The event was held under the aegis of Fair Trade Forum-India (FTF-I), which is attached to International Fair Trade Association.

 A delegation from Tokyos Chuo University also attended the meet to assess the Indian fair trade scenario, compare it with the situation in Japan and explore possibilities of trade between the countries.

 Gayatri Patra, the programme co-ordinator of Child and Social Welfare Society, a self-help group that works in the Midnapores and parts of Bankura and Purulia, told Metro on the sidelines of the seminar that it was about to set up a website. Our mattresses and other bamboo products like saris, bags and computer covers are in demand in the international market. But the 1,600 workers attached to us do not get the prices they deserve. A website of our own would help them get a fair deal, she said.

 Vijaya Ray, the co-ordinator of Unnayan Sansthan, an NGO based in Chunar, in Mirzapur district of Uttar Pradesh, echoed her: The pottery of the region is world famous. We also produce carpets. But some of our skilled workers get a pathetic wage of Rs 30 daily.

 The NGO will shortly go online from its Varanasi office. We expect the website to make a huge difference to our sales and the prices we receive, resulting in more money for talented artists.

 Stephen Hesse, an American professor of sociology at Chuo University and the head of the delegation, said groups of entrepreneurs producing similar goods should look to share a portal. He said the fair trade market in Japan has more than doubled in the past two years and the same could happen in India.

 Fair trade is a trading partnership based on dialogue, transparency and respect. Upholding the rights of the marginalised producers and workers is our top priority, said Sengupta, who is also the secretary of FTF-I.

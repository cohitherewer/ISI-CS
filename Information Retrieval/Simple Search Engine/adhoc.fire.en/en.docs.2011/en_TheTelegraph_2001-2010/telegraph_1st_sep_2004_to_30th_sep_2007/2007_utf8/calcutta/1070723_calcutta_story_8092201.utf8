The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kotwal to commissioner

 Policemen in Calcutta, from early accounts of the city such as Sachitra Narak Guljar and Hutom Penchar Naksha to present-day chronicles like the novels of Nabarun Bhattacharya, have been the butt of jokes for their alleged corruption, pettiness, highhandedness, inefficiency and intimidation and oppression of the poor and the helpless.

 P. Thankappan Nairs illuminating book, Origin of the Kolkata Police, recently released at the inauguration of a police museum, presents a balanced view of the history of the cops both ruddy (lalmukho, as Bengalis called them) and swarthy feared and hated in pre-Independence days, without making any attempt at whitewashing their image. Ironically, it does not show the natives in a favourable light, either.

 Nair uses carefully-researched archival material to put across his case, and going by his text, there really has been little improvement in police-public relations ever since the British left the country. Most of the material reproduced here extensively rings true even today.

 This is, perhaps, the first book in which the past of policemen has been dug up so efficiently, and quite understandably Nair begins with the acquisition by the Company of the zemindari rights of three villages under a bainama. Nairs narrative ends in 1866, and in these 780 pages, he squeezes in all the details one possibly can, even at the risk of occasionally sounding dry and boring. But these very details could be invaluable material for future research scholars.

 He, for example, has reproduced various documents and pieces of legislation relating to the police organisation, from the bainama or deed of transfer of zemindari rights of Calcutta, 1698, to the Calcutta Police Act, 1866. Not exactly reader-friendly material, but scholars may think otherwise.

 It is a treat to read about the kotwals, jemmautdaars, beadles, pykes and watchmen, punishments meted out to burglars and other culprits and Warren Hastingss police reforms. Hastings enacted that every convicted dacoit should be executed in his own village with the forms and terrors of law; his family made slaves, and every inhabitant of his village fined.

 Lord William Bentinck in his Minute dated September 8, 1829, wrote: The great inefficiency of the Police of this large City is the subject of universal remark. This led to the creation of the post of the commissioner of police. The book has a portrait gallery of police commissioners past and present. 

 But for the record, police munificence had nothing to do with its publication.

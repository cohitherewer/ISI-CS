 A celebration of life

 Portraying the joyous, cheerful side of life in rich and glorious colours, Vibrant Hues, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by a group of artists presents a collection of canvases that celebrates life and art in a visual language that can best be described as natural, original and spontaneous. Yellow, orange and red dominate the works on show, symbolising the pure bliss and happiness associated with daily life and rekindling emotions that we have all but forgotten to experience. Pulsating positive, optimistic thoughts, the life-like forms and figures, along with their vibrant colour schemes, emanate a raw, powerful yet benign energy. Soothing to the eye and appealing to the heart, the colour compositions make a brilliant attempt at blending the real with the ethereal. Exuding warmth, happiness, love and friendship, the paintings possess a natural, unconstrained splendour, which is, perhaps, an expression of the strongest creative forte of the artists. Participants: Anup Giri, Anirban Seth, Dewashis Das, Stuti Laha, Avishankar Mitra, Nitya Kundu (a painting by him appears above), Subrata Pal, Abhijit Mitra, Sukanta Das, Swapan Das, Diptish Ghosh Dastidar, Debendra Laha, Subrata Das, Bishwajit Saha and Shyamal Mukherjee.

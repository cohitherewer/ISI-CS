 Internal appraisal in college

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University is considering a proposal to introduce internal assessment of students at the undergraduate level. 

 According to the proposal, weightage will be assigned to marks scored in internal assessment while preparing the final BA, B.Sc and B.Com results.

 The move follows a dismal performance in Part I of BA, B.Sc and B.Com courses under the 1+1+1 system and is aimed at improving teaching standards in colleges.

 The syllabi and question patterns underwent major changes in the new 1+1+1 system. Students now need to be assessed in the classroom on a regular basis. This is possible only by the colleges, said pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of the university Suranjan Das.

 The proposal will soon be placed before the universitys council for undergraduate studies, he added. Principals and teachers of the colleges and university officials constitute the council.

 If the proposal is cleared by the council, it will be placed before the university syndicate for final approval, explained Das. 

 More than 40 per cent of the 83,288 students who took the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I examinations, the results of which were declared last week, have not been able to clear all the five subjects.

 The examinees failed to score the minimum qualifying marks of 23 (out of 100) in several subjects, but the highest number of failures was in mathematics. About 31 per cent of the students who had mathematics as an elective subject failed to score the pass marks. 

 Worried over the number of failures, the university had announced its decision to assess the teaching techniques in 160 colleges affiliated to it.

 Through the introduction of the internal assessment of students, the university intends to provide more academic freedom to the colleges, said university officials.

 To ensure that the colleges maintain transparency in the process of internal assessment, the university will keep vigil on the institutions, the officials added.

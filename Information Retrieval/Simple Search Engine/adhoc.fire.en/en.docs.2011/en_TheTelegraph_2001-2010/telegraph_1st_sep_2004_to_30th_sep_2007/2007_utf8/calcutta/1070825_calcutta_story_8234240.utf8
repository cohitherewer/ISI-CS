The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 School throws book at site

 - Students warned of disciplinary action, even expulsion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 City schools are engaged in a virtual war. In a circular issued for parental consent, La Martiniere for Boys (LMB) has forbidden students from keeping accounts, profiles on Orkut. Stating that a lot of damage has already been done by what is supposedly a social networking site, the authorities cautioned parents that if any boy who is not 18 years old is found to continue maintaining his Orkut account, he will be subject to severe disciplinary action and even liable to be expelled from school...

 Principal S. Chakravarthi told Metro: I dont enjoy having to ban it and I know its difficult to check, but I had to do this to protect my students.

 LMB joins Apeejay School in banning the site. We banned Orkut immediately after the Mumbai murder (of Adnan Patrawala, 16, by boys he had befriended on the site). Orkut is very popular and it is not going to be easy to stop students from using it, admitted principal Rita Chatterjee.

 That is an understatement, what with Orkut being voted MTV Youth Icon 2007 earlier this week, beating the likes of Rang De Basanti and multimedia cellphones.

 So most schools are choosing vigil over ban. Modern High School was among the first to crack down on all dangerous and addictive social networking and chat sites. At South Point, the popular cyberzone is under strict supervision, while St James is threatening stern action against students found on Orkut.

 But how can schools monitor a students Net behaviour outside the classroom or stop someone from posting a students profile by proxy on Orkut? The simple answer is that they cannot. So, as Seema Sapru, principal, Heritage School, says, counselling is the key to safe tech usage by students.

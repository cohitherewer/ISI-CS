The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 People propose, cops dispose

 - Metro readers seek bus bays, hefty fines for errant 

 drivers and speedbreakers to check mishaps 

 tt city for killer wheels 

 With the state administration 

 turning a blind eye to the blood on the streets, Metro turned 

 to its readers for suggestions. A few popular safety pointers 

 and police reactions...

 Make it mandatory for 

 all buses to have photographs of drivers prominently displayed.

 Make it mandatory for 

 the bus owner to keep a set of photographs of the driver 

 with him, along with residential proof.

 This would enable police 

 to trace the driver, if he escapes after the accident.

 Hari Shankar

 We cannot make it mandatory for 

 buses to display photographs as this falls under the purview 

 of the public vehicles department (PVD). If there is a picture 

 of the driver, it will definitely help us trace him faster.

 But otherwise, too, it is not 

 much of a problem for us, as we impound the bus, trace the 

 owner and make sure he produces the driver.

 Ranveer Kumar,

 joint commissioner of police (traffic)

 Designate bus lanes on 

 all major routes, and ensure that the buses move only along 

 these lanes. This shall put an end to overtaking and racing 

 on roads.

 Buses shall not be allowed 

 to stop anywhere else other than at designated bus stops.

 The commission system 

 of paying drivers (on the basis of number of trips made 

 and number of passengers picked up) should be scrapped and 

 drivers paid on an hourly basis.

 Harsh Goenka,

 Ballygunge.

 The bus lane is a very good suggestion 

 and we did start such a system. But people started parking 

 their vehicles along the bay, making it difficult for the 

 bus to ply (a prime example is CIT Road from the Kankurgachhi 

 roundabout to Hudco crossing).

 Even passengers do not co-operate 

 if a bus sticks to the bay, as it slows the vehicle down. 

 But we will soon be reviving the system on CIT Road and 

 Syed Amir Ali Avenue.

 The rest of the points have to 

 be addressed by the PVD and transport department.

 Ranveer Kumar

 Jaywalkers must be fined. 

 At present, you cannot blame them at some points because 

 the pavements have been taken over by government-sponsored 

 hawkers.

 Rajan Advani,

 Tiljala Road.

 We want citizens to be law- abiding 

 and we did take up a drive to book jaywalkers. But pedestrians 

 should also take measures about their own safety. It is 

 not possible for us to be present everywhere.

 Ranveer Kumar

 A bus drivers licence 

 should be punched and a fine imposed for the following offences:

 Stopping in the middle of the road and picking up passengers 

 between stops

 Unnecessary delay at certain stops to pick up passengers, 

 leading to traffic snarls.

 Going slow on thoroughfares and forcing other vehicles to 

 overtake, often from the wrong side, endangering pedestrians. 

 Swarup Chakraborty 

 We do book drivers for stopping in the middle of the road 

 and picking up passengers between two stops

 We do our best to keep the traffic flowing near bus stops

 We cannot book vehicles for going slow.

 Ranveer Kumar

 Speedbreakers must be 

 provided on either side of school gates and all roads must 

 have a speed limit of 40kph. Police must be equipped with 

 electronic speed readers to trap offenders and heavy fines 

 should be imposed on them, including cancellation of licence 

 and imprisonment.

 Rajan Advani

 Sergeants are always present in 

 front of schools when they start and give over. There has 

 never been a single accident in front of a school gate.

 We are in the process of modernising 

 the traffic police force and the points suggested by the 

 readers will, of course, be considered.

 Ranveer Kumar

 After an accident, the mechanical 

 test undergone by a bus should be conducted by an independent 

 expert or agency appointed by the judiciary. The police 

 are known to give the bus a clean chit for a fee from the 

 bus owner or find a mechanical fault under pressure from 

 the union to shield the bus driver.

 Soumitra Das,

 Gariahat

 We know that some corrupt policemen 

 are involved in this. We will take stringent action against 

 such cops.

 Ranveer Kumar

 What should the public vehicles 

 department and the transport department do to make our streets

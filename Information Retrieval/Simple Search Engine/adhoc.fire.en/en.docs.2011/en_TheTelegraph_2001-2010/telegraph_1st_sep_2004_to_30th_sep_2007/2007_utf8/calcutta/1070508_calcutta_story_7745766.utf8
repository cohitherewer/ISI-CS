 The technology to measure pollutants emitted by moving vehicles has reached the city.

 A machine known as Remote Sensing Device, set up on the western flank of the Park Street flyover on Monday, measured the pollution caused by each of the thousands of vehicles that passed the stretch. It also took snapshots of the vehicles as they passed.

 Currently, a vehicle needs to be stopped for at least half-an-hour for pollution tests using a gas analyser or smoke meter.

 The state environment department set up the mobile device as part of a pilot project. This is the latest technology to monitor vehicular pollution. We plan to make the gadgets a permanent feature in the city if the project is a success, said environment secretary M.L. Meena. 

 He has discussed the matter with transport department officials.

 Once our experts approve of the method, we will try to introduce provisions under the Environment Protection Act to penalise green norm violators, said Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the environment department.

 The device uses laser, infrared and ultraviolet rays to instantly record the pollution data. According to senior environmental engineer P.K. Roy, the pilot study will continue across the city through the week.

 The technology is being used in the US, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Korea, Sri Lanka and Singapore.

 The device has been tested in Delhi, Pune, Bhopal and Mumbai. The central government is considering a proposal to introduce the technology in 11 metro cities, claimed Nitin Manawat, country manager of ESP India, the manufacturers of the device.

 The Remote Sensing Device measures hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and smoke emission through the tailpipe. The vehicles speed, age and photograph are also recorded. About 3,000 vehicles can be tested per hour by the machine, added Manawat.

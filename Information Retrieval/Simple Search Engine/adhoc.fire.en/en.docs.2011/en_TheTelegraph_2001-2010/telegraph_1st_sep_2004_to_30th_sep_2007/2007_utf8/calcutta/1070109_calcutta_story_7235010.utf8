 Corpus for CU campus upkeep

 - UGC sanctions special, one-time grant of Rs 86.55 lakh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The College Street and Rajabazar Science College campuses of Calcutta University (CU) will soon get a fresh look.

 For the first time, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has sanctioned a special, one-time grant of Rs 86.55 lakh to the university for the upkeep of its old buildings. The UGC wrote to the university last week, approving the grant.

 Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), said the funds would be utilised mainly for the renovation and upkeep of the College Street and Rajabazar Science College campuses.

 Both the campuses are more than 100 years old and proper renovation is necessary. Students, teachers and employees have long been demanding an overall upgrade of the universitys old buildings. The UGC grant will enable us to do the needful, said Das, who is also a member of the UGC.

 The grant has brought relief to the university authorities, as only three weeks ago, a team from the UGC had expressed unhappiness over the untidy looks and poor maintenance of the College Street and Rajabazar campuses.

 A 12-member UGC team visited the university last month to inspect all its seven campuses.

 The inspection was held to examine the vision report the university had prepared to list the possible heads under which it intended to spend the Rs 30 crore the commission had released after the institute was awarded the centre of excellence tag.

 Officials said that according to the conditions laid down by the UGC, the university can utilise the Rs 86.55 lakh for the renovation and upkeep of the buildings more than 25 years old.

 We are preparing a detailed project report on the renovation plan, said an official.

 A committee will soon be set up to prepare the project report. It will be placed before the universitys syndicate by February for final approval. Though the UGC has not set any deadline for utilising the funds, the university has decided to take prompt action to ensure the funds are utilised at the earliest.

 The UGC finalised its decision to sanction the grant to the university at a meeting in Delhi last Friday. Pro vice-chancellor Das attended the meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Eight surgeries in eight years

 - Consumer forum orders negligent doctors to pay woman compensation

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Doctors callousness has triggered a chain reaction of six surgeries within two years a total of eight surgeries in eight years and Anjana Bose Roy of Ranikuthi, south Calcutta, doesnt really know where to go. 

 Anjanas parental house at Ichapur has been sold off and her family has spent more than Rs 10 lakh on her diagnosis, multiple surgeries and medication.

 The last time Anjana attended a social function was in 1999, and the perforation in her urinary bladder, caused by the doctors negligence, has left her in agony and despair. 

 It all began on March 25, 1999, when doctors B.B. Dey and D.K. Majumder conducted a hysterectomy and surgery on her in a nursing home, to repair the hernia from which she was suffering after her second childbirth.

 During the surgery, her urinary bladder got perforated and the doctors sent her home with a catheter. As soon the catheter was taken off, there was an uncontrolled flow of urine. The doctors didnt own up to what they had done. Instead, when I went to ask Majumder, he misbehaved with me, alleged Anjana.

 What followed was a series of visits to hospitals and subsequent surgeries. She visited AMRI Hospitals and the CMRI hospital to undergo two consecutive surgeries with different surgeons, but with no success. 

 Frustrated, Anjana underwent her fourth surgery in December 1999 in Apollo hospital, Hyderabad. But the problem recurred and two more surgeries that failed followed in 2000 and 2001.

 Anjana had moved the South 24-Parganas District Consumer Forum against the two negligent doctors. The forum ordered Dey and Majumder to pay compensations of Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh, respectively. 

 While Dey paid up, Majumder decided to move the the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission against the order. In a recent judgment, the commission slapped a fine of Rs 2 lakh on the erring doctor. 

 I am not at fault and I will move the national commission against the court verdict, Majumder, however, said.

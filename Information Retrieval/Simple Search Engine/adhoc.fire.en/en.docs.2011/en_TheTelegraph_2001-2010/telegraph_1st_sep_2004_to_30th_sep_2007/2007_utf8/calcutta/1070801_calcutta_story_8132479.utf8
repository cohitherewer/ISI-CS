The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Half lakh for seat 

at NRS

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Entally police station has started a probe against a doctor for allegedly promising to get a youth admitted to NRS Medical College this year against a payment of Rs 50,000. 

 Police stumbled upon the case on Monday when Ramanuj Ghosh of Konnagar in Hooghly walked into NRS Medical College carrying an identity card with a fake signature of the college dean and met principal Ashoke Mondal to find out details of classes. When Mondal went through the documents he realised that Ghoshs ID card was fake and informed the police.

 Interrogation revealed that Ramanujs father, Deb Kumar Ghosh, had recently met Piyush Kanti Ghosh, who claimed he was a doctor in Konnagar.

 According to Deb Kumar, Piyush told him that he would be able to ensure a berth for his son at NRS Medical College through the donor quota. Deb Kumar, himself an MBBS, would have to pay Rs 50,000 in cash for his son Ramanuj to Piyush Kanti. 

 Accordingly, Deb Kumar turned up near Shyambazar five-point crossing a few days back and handed over the cash. Piyush Kanti handed over an ID card to the doctor for his son saying that he should produce it before the principal of the college for admission, said a senior officer of Entally police station. 

 The police have learnt that Ramanuj secured about 57 per cent marks in his Higher Secondary examination this year, and was planning to appear for JEE again the next year when his father, who practises from his house on Shiba Chandra Street in Konnagar, met Piyush Kanti.

 Apart from a description of Piyush Kanti provided by the Ghosh family little else is known about the man.

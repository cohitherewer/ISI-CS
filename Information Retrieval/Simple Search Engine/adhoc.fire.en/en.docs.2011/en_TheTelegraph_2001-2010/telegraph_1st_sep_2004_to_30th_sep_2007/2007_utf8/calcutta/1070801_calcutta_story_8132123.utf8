 Medical scam marks puzzle

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Amid the search for four more candidates who may have cleared JEE 2007 with the help of dummies, the focus has now shifted to the academic background of Ranvijay Pathak and Mihir Kumar Jha. Police are wondering if they, too, got admission to MBBS through dubious means.

 Pathak, the police have learnt, had scored 1 out of 100 in the final exam on opthalmology and had not fared too well in the two other papers in the first of the two sets of tests in the final year. 

 The sleuths are also wondering how Jha, with a below-average academic background, had cleared the MBBS exam without a single supplementary test and even secured a rank of 12 in the state-wide postgraduate entrance test and 800-plus in the nation-wide examination.

 We would surely like to look into the academic background of both Pathak and Jha. But that would entail a lot of paper work. There are different layers in the JEE scam and it would take sometime to get to the root of it, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 The police have talked to some of the classmates of the two at Medical College, where Pathak is in the final year of the MBBS course, and SSKM, where Jha is a postgraduate student in radiology.

 Officers have met students, who could possibly throw some light on the academic background of the two. Jha, on his part, has clarified that he appeared for all the nationwide MBBS entrance tests, including JIPMER and AFMC, and finally made it to Medical College through the AIPMT. 

 Some postgraduate students and those in the final years of their MBBS at Medical College wondered how a student like Pathak could make it to the radiology course.

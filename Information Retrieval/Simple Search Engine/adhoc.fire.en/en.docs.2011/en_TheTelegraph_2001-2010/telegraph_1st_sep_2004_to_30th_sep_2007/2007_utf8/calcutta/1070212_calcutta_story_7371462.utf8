 Nandan is married and has two children. He is looking for a part-time job to take care of his family. Mithu wants business travellers to put up in her flat. Deep wants to work in the information technology industry.

 They are all afflicted with cerebral palsy, but dare to dream, thanks to Diane Bryen, professor of Temple University in the US and executive director of the universitys Central Institute for Disability Research and Public Policy.

 This is part of a global project called Dare to Dream, which empowers people with disabilities to turn their dreams into reality, said Bryen. She has taken the project to the US, South Africa and Israel and will soon extend its reach to Australia.

 For Bryen, who has been to India twice, there are similarities between the country and people with disabilities. From outside, India with its noise and pollution can push people away, just like the appearance of a person with disability can. When you spend more time, you see the beauty inside, she observed.

 The professor spent three weeks at Indian Institute for Cerebral Palsy taking adults with disabilities, staff and parents through the steps of making dreams possible. We encourage people to overcome oppression and think where they want to see themselves 10 years from now. We also empower them to communicate their dreams to others, stated Bryen.

 Those attending the workshop had to draw up an action plan to fulfil their dreams. The group learnt leadership skills and using the Internet for work, entertainment, pursuit of hobbies and making friends.

 The participants, with the help of a coach, also took the first step towards achieving their dreams. It can be calling up someone who can help take their plans forward, explained Bryen. Parents are told that there is no hope for children with disabilities. We want them to know that they can have a bright future.

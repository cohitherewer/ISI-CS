 The uprising that killed Pradip Mullick, or Dom Pradip, on Saturday night might not have been as spontaneous as it seemed.

 Police said on Monday that some of Pradips associates might have instigated the mob, comprising mostly women, that lynched the criminal in Chetlas Lockgate area.

 The associates had, perhaps, feared that Pradips return he was out on bail after six years would challenge their sway in Chetla, said a senior police officer.

 Its too early to jump to any conclusion. Lets wait. We will find out if there is more than what meets the eye, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Ajoy Kumar.

 But what led the police to suspect that the lynching was an insiders job?

 Those who accompanied Pradip that day were presumably armed. But they did not fire a shot or hurl a bomb at the mob. They just turned their car and sped off, leaving their boss at the mercy of the mob, pointed out an officer.

 Its difficult to believe that Pradips men, all hardened criminals, would panic at the sight of a clutch of women, he added.

 Senior officers with the experience of handling mass protests said women, while chasing a common enemy, are usually armed with broomsticks and bontis.

 But in Chetla, the women were carrying bamboo sticks, broken wickets and bricks. True, they had attacked Pradip, but the real killing might have been carried out by someone else, said a senior officer in the homicide wing of the detective department.

 Among the names that have cropped up as being responsible for fuelling the uprising is Sreedhar, who had helped Pradip step into south Calcuttas crime world but fell out with him over the share of extortion money.

 The other suspects are Gurey and Ajoy Sardar, who have been controlling Pradips fief since his arrest in October 2000 in a murder case.

 The women in Lockgate, however, claimed they had risen in spontaneous revolt to get rid of the man they had suffered for so long. Even for setting up a tea stall, you had to pay him Rs 5,000, said Kajal Halder, a local resident. 

 Chapala Sardar said Pradip had raped and killed her elder daughter Maya seven years ago.

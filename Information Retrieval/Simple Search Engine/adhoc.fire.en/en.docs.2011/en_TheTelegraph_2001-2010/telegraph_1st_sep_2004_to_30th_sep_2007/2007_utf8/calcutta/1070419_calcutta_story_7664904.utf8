 Six sets of questions

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The undergraduate council of Calcutta University has decided to hold six rounds of examinations with six different sets of question papers in three subjects environmental science, compulsory English and modern Indian languages for students appearing for the 2007 Part-I examinations.

 The decision was taken after a four-hour meeting of the council on Wednesday afternoon.

 The decision to split the examinations in these three popular subjects was taken with a view to tackling the space jam in the 150-year-old university, caused by nearly 1.10 lakh examinees.

 We had to split the papers and the examinees to ensure that the the Part I examinations are conducted smoothly. But we have divided the exams in a way that students wont be affected, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), after Wednesdays meeting.

 Elaborating on the new measure, Das said the Part-I examinations on the three subjects in BA, B.Sc and B.Com (under the 1+1+1 scheme) would be held in six parts for both honours and general course students.

 For instance, all the students under the BA (honours) courses will appear for the examination on the same day. Similarly, the exams for B.Sc and B.Com (honours) students will be held on two separate dates with different sets of question papers.

 The university has set three different dates for general students in BA, B.Sc and B.Com. 

 The decision was only approved after a heated debate among members of the council as a section of teacher members opposed the proposed splitting of the examination.

 The university should have had a far-sightedness about the increase in examinee count and should have taken appropriate measures in advance, pointed out a member.

 Some members objected to the proposal citing the conventional rules, practised in universities across the country. The students of a university studying a particular subject under a common syllabus should sit for the examination with the same set of question paper on the same day, argued a council member.

 Sylvie Rocard is all praise for the city and its people for taking good care of husband Michel, a former Prime Minister of France, who was operated on in a private hospital after suffering a brain haemorrhage.

 Rocard is recovering well and sources at Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI), where he is being treated, said he could be released by Tuesday.

 I was alone (when Rocard suffered the haemorrhage) and though I can speak English, I thought it would be difficult here. But the people here have been very helpful and have taken good care of my husband, Sylvie said on Friday.

 A stay in hospital was definitely not on our plans for India, but Ive got to know the warmth of the people in this city during my stay here, she added.

 The 76-year-old former Prime Minister and his wife have been visiting India on an invitation from the external affairs ministry. 

 They arrived in Calcutta on a cultural trip on June 29 and were scheduled to meet the members of the West Bengal Federation of United Nations Association and Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and also visit the Asiatic Society.

 It was on their way from Delhi to Calcutta that Sylvie noticed Rocard suffering some discomfort. On contacting the French embassy in Delhi, they were put in touch with Santanu Chatterjee, the president of the Asia Pacific Travel Health Society. 

 Chatterjee decided to carry out some urgent investigations the next morning.

 He had a hectic schedule on Saturday and I did not want him to go through it without knowing what was wrong, said Chatterjee. 

 A CT scan revealed Rocard had suffered a sudural haemorrhage. He was operated on the same afternoon at CMRI and was kept in the ICU for the next 48 hours.

 His wound is healing satisfactorily. He complained of a pain in the left knee yesterday. We are looking into it, said G.K. Prusty, a neurosurgeon who performed the operation.

 Rocard will be flown to Paris on a private plane, but before that, he wants to fulfil all his commitments here.

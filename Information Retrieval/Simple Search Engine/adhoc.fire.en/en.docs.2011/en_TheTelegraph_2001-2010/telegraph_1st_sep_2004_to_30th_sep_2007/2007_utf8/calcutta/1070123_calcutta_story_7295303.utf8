 HAVEN HOPE: Children perform at the opening of the shelter home. Picture by Chandreyee Chatterjee

 CINI Asha, the urban wing of Child In Need Institute (CINI), opened its shelter home for vulnerable and high-risk children, Hamara Ghar, on January 22. The home, supported by GOAL India, on Pottery Road, is expected to cater to more than 200 children on a daily basis. It will start functioning in a week.

 Previously, we use to operate a halfway house and we reached out to 30-35 children. But a lot of children need guidance and support. Hamara Ghar is a multi-faceted attempt to achieve our goal, explained Partha Roy, deputy director (programmes), CINI. 

 The new home, near Loreto School, Entally, will have a halfway house, an intermediate unit for counselling and primary education for traumatised children. It will house a playground, a recreational centre and a sick bay that will provide medical treatment.

 The building will be a short-stay home for children rescued by those manning helpline 1098, run by the Union ministry of women and child development.

 In tune with CINI Ashas commitment to child development, the building will act as a preparatory centre, where school dropouts will undergo a bridge course before they join mainstream schools. The children will be trained at the special coaching centre. 

 We have been working for childrens development and hope to reach more children with the new home, added Sameer Narayan Chaudhuri, director, CINI.

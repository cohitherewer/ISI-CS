 Break-in bid at ATM

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man in his early 30s tried to break open a State Bank of India (SBI) ATM on BT Road, near Sinthee, early on Sunday. The attempt proved futile, but he managed to escape. 

 According to police, footage recorded by a hidden camera showed the man entering the kiosk around 2.50 am. He used an SBI card to open the door, but did not insert it into the ATM. He disconnected the machines wires and tried to break it open. After he failed to do so, he fell asleep in the kiosk, said a police officer.

 An SBI account-holder entered the kiosk around 6 am and woke up the man. He said he had fallen asleep while waiting for the machine to start working, and walked away.

 Engineer home after two nights

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Engineer Anup Ranjan Roy, who returned home on Wednesday

 Anup Ranjan Roy, a senior CESC engineer who went missing on Monday on his way back from his Budge Budge office, returned to his Jadavpur home on Wednesday, dazed and incoherent.

 We saw father getting off a taxi around 10.45am and he looked really exhausted, said Debadrita, Roys daughter. No one disturbed him, since he wanted to rest.

 It is not clear what happened to him in the 48 hours after he went missing on his way to his Ullaskar Dutta Road residence.

 As he is unwell, we didnt interrogate him properly, said D.P. Singh, additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas. 

 Roy has some bruises on his body and cuts on his face, and the police are not ruling out foul play.

 We are confused, as he couldnt say where he had been, said Roys father-in-law, Nihar Ranjan Dutta. 

 According to Dutta, Roy told his family he went to the CESC head office at Esplanade after work and withdrew Rs 10,000. We found only Rs 3,000 in his wallet.... He told us that he went to Howrah and spent the whole night there. He also told us he went looking for his daughter. But his words lack coherence and he looks like hes in a state of shock.

 Roys family was relieved at his return and decided to find out later where he had been. Debadrita, a B.Com student, said: We couldnt sleep or eat for the past two nights. Now, we are very happy and this evening, Ive bought him a mobile phone so that we can always keep in touch. 

 Roy left home on Sunday morning to attend office and was supposed to return home on Monday night.

 But when he did not turn up, his family members started a search for him and lodged a missing diary with three police stations.

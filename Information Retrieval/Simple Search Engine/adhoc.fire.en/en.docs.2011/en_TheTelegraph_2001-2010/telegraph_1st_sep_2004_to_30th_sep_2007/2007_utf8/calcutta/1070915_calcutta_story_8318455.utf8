 Gag on decibel devil

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government is gearing up to curb noise pollution during the upcoming festive season.

 It was decided at a meeting between police and the state pollution control board on Friday that amplifiers of the sound systems in puja pandals will have to be fitted with sound limiters. 

 The limiter keeps the sound within 65 decibels. 

 The permissible sound limit in residential areas is 65 decibels, which is often violated during festivities.

 Since the limiter flashes the decibel, we hope it will make it easier for people to detect noise pollution and report it to the authorities, said an official of the pollution control board.

 Use of sound limiters will be one of the conditions for granting police permission to puja organisers, he added.

 The government will also enforce noise norms on the rallies of all political parties, which are the worst offenders. 

 As for the ongoing crackdown on vehicles using the banned air horns, an official said: We have decided to include motor vehicles inspectors in the drive. 

 The government has also decided to intensify raids on the manufacturers and dealers of banned firecrackers.

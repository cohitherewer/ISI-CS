The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Why city wont rise to help: Samaritan in the soup

 A STAFF REPORTER

 First, he had to spend more than 12 hours in the lock-up of Barasat police station. Then, he had to cough up Rs 950 to come out from the clutches of the law-keepers. 

 But Shibnath Sinhas litany of woes did not end there. On Sunday, around 36 hours after he played Samaritan to a couple at Hridaypur rail station, he lost a business order.

 I take up plumbing work in buildings. Recently, I won a big order from Raj Promoters. But I have lost it after the police case, Shibnath told Metro. 

 The 27-year-old expected to earn around Rs 15,000 from the order. For the Sinha family, with a monthly income of around Rs 3,000, the contract meant a lot. 

 But after learning about his detention in Barasat police station, the promoter of the project, coming up near Baguiati, clearly told Shibnath that he did not want any trouble with the cops. 

 He said police will hound me as I was dragged into an attempt-to-murder case. So, my order was cancelled, recounted Shibnath, sitting in his house at 91 Kundu Bagan, Jawpur Road, in Dum Dum. 

 The sole earning member in a family of four, Shibnath is now clueless about his future. According to him, he was dragged into the police case purely on suspicion. 

 Shibnath was picked up from Dak Bungalow More, in Barasat, on Thursday night. Spotting bloodstains on his white shirt, the patrol team from Barasat thana thought that he was involved in a crime that took place in Barasats Nabapally a few hours ago. 

 On Thursday evening, a man was arrested in Nabapally for trying to kill his wife with a chopper. They thought I was involved in that crime. No one wanted to know that the stains were from the blood of a woman who passed out at the station and started bleeding from a head injury. I had carried her to a medical store, said Shibnath. 

 After spending more than 12 hours behind bars, he was released on Friday afternoon. The Sinha family spent Rs 950 for his bail papers. 

 Soma, Shibnaths wife, went to the police station after learning about his detention. We reached the thana around 10.30am and were told that we had to spend Rs 950 to get him bail. We paid the sum to a man, who met us outside the police station, recounted Soma. 

 Shibnath was released after a few hours and the family left for their Dum Dum home. Though the man took money from us, he did not give any papers as proof of his bail. By that time, we were exhausted and so did not demand any papers, either, she added. 

 Sasanka Shekhar Chakraborty, the officer-in-charge of Barasat police station, however, said the question of granting Shibnath bail did not arise as he was not arrested. We kept him in custody only for the night and released him the next day after confirming his identity, said Chakraborty. 

 But the Sinhas want to forget the entire episode. What we want to remember is the one lesson the incident taught us. We will never again help strangers, summed up Soma.

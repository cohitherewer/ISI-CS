 Fast forward in stents

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Biodegradable arterial stent, which doctors say can revolutionise coronary angioplasty, is likely to be available in India in around three years.

 Animal trials of biodegradable stents have been successful and human trials are being carried out now, said Anil Mishra, interventional cardiologist and medical director, BM Birla Heart Research Centre.

 We expect the stent will arrive in India in three-four years, said Michael Orlowski, CEO, Eurocor GmbH. He was speaking at the Interventional Cardiology Summit, 2007, held in Goa last week.

 A stent a cage of surgical-grade stainless steel is implanted in an artery that has turned narrow because of deposition of fatty material on the inner wall.

 In case of the bare metal stent, only the metal structure is implanted in the artery. But doctors say that in 15 to 20 per cent of the cases, the artery gets blocked again. 

 With drug-coated stent (DES) in which the metal has a coat of drug covered with a layer of polymer the chance of reblocking has gone down by half. 

 But there are some complications in the usage of DES. There is need for constant improvement in technology, said Nishit Choksi, director, Cathlab for Vascular Interventions, William Beaumont Hospital, Michigan.

 The metal and the polymer stays inside the body, causing problems like allergic reactions and thrombosis, Mishra explained. 

 A biodegradable stent, on the other hand, will be in the body for a few months. After remodelling of the blocked blood vessel is complete, it will disintegrate, he pointed out. 

 The polymer coating on the stent is organic and safe, said Orlowski. The polymer will dissolve within 28 days of the implant.

 Doctors, however, feel more trials are required before biodegradable stents can be used commercially.

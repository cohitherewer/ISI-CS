A 30-year-old labourer relieving himself by the side of EM Bypass, near Ruby General Hospital, was killed after being hit by an oil tanker on Sunday afternoon. The tanker plunged headlong into a canal.

 Police identified the victim as Nabon Mahato, a resident of Bihar. The oil tanker was being driven at a high speed. The driver lost control and hit Mahato from behind, throwing him into the canal, said an investigating officer of Tiljala police station.

 Local residents informed the police. Mahato was fished out from the canal and taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead.

 He sustained serious injuries on his head and chest. He was bleeding profusely from his nose and mouth and his legs and hands were fractured, added the officer. 

 The police suspect the driver of the vehicle was drunk.

 Both the driver and his help were not hurt in the mishap and managed to escape. We found two bottles of liquor inside the drivers cabin. We have traced the owner of the vehicle and a raid is on to nab the driver, said another officer. 

 Mahato was walking along the Bypass with Ajoy Das, who worked with him. Around 12.10pm, Mahato went to the side of the road to relieve himself in the canal.

 Das, who was waiting for him further down the road, said: The tanker hit Mahato so hard that he was flung into the canal. The vehicle fell with him.

 The two were on their way to work at a construction site in Tiljala.

 Mahato hailed from Bihar and had been working as a daily wage labourer in the city for the past couple of years. He stayed with his wife and a son in a Tiljala slum, said the officer.

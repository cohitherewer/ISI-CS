 Green body toothless in panel maze

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government stands accused of rendering the pollution control board (PCB) defunct by appointing a string of committees to deal with environment issues.

 Sources in the government and environment activists say these committees have pushed through several projects that had been either opposed or struck down by the board.

 One such committee, the East Calcutta Wetlands Management Authority, had recently allowed CESC to set up high-tension cables over the East Calcutta Wetlands, ignoring the boards objections. 

 The board had pointed out that the high court had banned construction on the wetlands, a Ramsar site, and that the project would disrupt the movement of migratory birds.

 Environment secretary M.L. Meena refused comment on the issue, but other officials in his department said the board can no longer stop the project, as it has been approved by the Wetlands Authority.

 Clearances such as this are usually shrouded in secrecy. Well raise this issue with the department, said Bonani Kakkar, of the NGO Public.

 Headed by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, the Authority had also given its nod to two controversial housing projects on the wetlands. In both cases, the board had fought legal battles against the promoters and the high court had even appointed an official to oversee demolition of the buildings.

 But the board could do nothing after the Authority asked the promoters to pay a fine for creating a waterbody and continue with the projects. Following the nod, the board lost the case in the Supreme Court.

 A few bureaucrats are running the show in environment matters, rendering the pollution watchdog ineffective, said an official.

 Sources attribute the move to curtail the boards authority to its decision to haul up the promoters of some major projects that allegedly violated rules. The boards decision did not go down well with an influential section in the government, said an official.

 The board had slapped a closure notice on a hotel for filling up a waterbody. The order was reversed after the hotel authorities petitioned the chief secretary. It had also issued marching orders to an institute on the wetlands, but the order wasnt implemented.

 Defending the panels, Meena said: Earlier, our department didnt know what the others, like the transport and fisheries departments were doing. With these committees, we have a joint roadmap.

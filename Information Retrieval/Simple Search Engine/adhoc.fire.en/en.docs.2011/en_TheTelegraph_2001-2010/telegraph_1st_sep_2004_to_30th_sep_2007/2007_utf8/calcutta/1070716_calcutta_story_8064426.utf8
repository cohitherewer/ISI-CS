 Rain alert on milk

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If it rains, it can be worse than a bandh. For two consecutive days, many people in the city and its suburbs went without milk because of waterlogging after the deluge on July 3.

 The animal resources development department failed to supply milk to distribution centres after the central dairy in Belgachhia went under water. The department has written to the civic body and the public health engineering department, seeking steps to prevent waterlogging around the dairy.

 We have to ensure that the waterlogging does not recur. It hampers our work which, in turn, affects the people, said animal resources development minister Anisur Rahaman. 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, however, failed to promise that the locality would no longer see waterlogging. Several pockets in the city will again go under water if there is heavy rainfall within a short period of time, he pointed out.

 We had started our work before the departments letter reached us. There is no problem with the pumps in the area. Water could not be flushed out as the Bagjola canal was overflowing. The problem cannot be solved unless the irrigation department does its bit, Bhattacharyya said.

 According to the animal resources development department sources, the five compressors in the dairy went under water after the July 3 downpour. The labourers had to be ferried in a boat. Milk vans could not enter because of water. Milk commissioner Sundar Majumdar said the department has appealed to the dairy staff not to throw plastic pouches in drains.

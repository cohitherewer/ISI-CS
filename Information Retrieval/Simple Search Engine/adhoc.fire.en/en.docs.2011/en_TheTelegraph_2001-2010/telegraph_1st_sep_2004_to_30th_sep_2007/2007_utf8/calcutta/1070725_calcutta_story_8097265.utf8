When the brightest budding managers decide to champion the cause of entrepreneurship, the result is a year of activities, from campus talks to one of the biggest business plan contests in India.

 The 35-member entrepreneurship cell of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, started its activities early this year, with Ascent 2007, a two-day workshop on A-Z of entrepreneurship over the weekend. A gamut of issues related to starting a business was taken up. 

 The workshop, organised with the help of the National Entrepreneurship Network, saw talks by the likes of entrepreneur and investor Mahesh Murthy, adman, restaurateur and cigar manufacturer Prahlad Kakkar and the chairman and CEO of Globsyn Technologies. The talks were aimed at exposing first-year postgraduate students to life as an entrepreneur.

 We wanted to get the freshers interested in entrepreneurship before the placement hype starts. Otherwise a lot of youngsters lose interest in entrepreneurship, said Anila Uppu, the head of the cell, which started in 2001 with a business plan competition called i2I.

 This year, the cell has planned to launch a bi-monthly magazine that will focus on five industries. We have decided to give the programmes of the cell a more formal structure. We have chosen four industries that the students will not be exposed to in the normal course for special attention. The fifth industry has to be chosen, added Uppu.

 The magazine, to be launched in the first week of September, will have interviews of veterans and new entrants in the industries. It will also have opinion polls on various issues.

 The business plan contest in December is the biggest event in the cells calendar. In fact, the other events lead up to the final one, said Uppu. The workshops, talks and magazines will provide tips to the contestants about start-ups, venture capitals and possible problems, according to Uppu.

 Very few members of the cell have gone on to become entrepreneurs immediately after completing B-school. But the cell members believe that they would definitely go on to do their own thing in future.

 I dont think that people should be desperate for ideas. They should wait for a good idea and they need to be in a position to implement it. It is best to gather a bit of experience before starting a venture, said Vijay Menon, the secretary of the external relations cell of the institute.

 JEE system revamp

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government has decided to revamp the joint entrance examination (JEE) system, stung by the scam exposed last week.

 Higher education minister Sudarsan Ray Chaudhury, speaking in the Assembly on Monday, admitted that the present system has loopholes and stressed the need to make it foolproof.

 The state JEE board has been asked to call an emergency meeting in the first week of September to review the system and come up with suggestions on plugging the loopholes. The system needs to be more transparent, the minister said, responding to a call attention motion placed by Debaprasad Sarkar (SUCI).

 The board has been asked to state whether it has identified the loopholes responsible for the scam, which has led to the arrest of two junior doctors, a medical intern and several others.

 We will decide on revising the examination system after going through the boards report, Ray Chaudhury said. We are also inviting opinions from the people on how best the system can be upgraded.

 The minister ruled out abolishing the system of admission through the joint entrance test. 

 The Supreme Court has made it mandatory to admit students to engineering or medical courses through a common entrance test.

 Sources in the higher education department said a preliminary investigation by the government has revealed that the faulty invigilation system followed by the board was in part responsible for the scam.

 The government is trying to find out how students with admit cards bearing hazy photographs were allowed to write the entrance test, said an official.

 The joint entrance racket had reportedly fielded dummy candidates to take the test after providing them with admit cards bearing blurred photographs.

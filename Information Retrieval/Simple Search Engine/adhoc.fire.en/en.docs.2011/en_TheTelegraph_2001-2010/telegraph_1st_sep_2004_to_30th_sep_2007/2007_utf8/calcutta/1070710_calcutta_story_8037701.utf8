 Subrata Das, alias Vinod Agarwal, alias Biltu, was arrested on Monday, eight days after he allegedly burgled the hotel room of a family from Nepal while they were busy with their daughters wedding reception in Calcutta.

 The 30-year-old was held at his ancestral home at Charantala, in Buxar, Bihar. The bulk of the stolen goods, including Rs 95,000 in cash and some silver ornaments, were recovered. Police also found Rs 15,000 in Nepali currency at his home.

 Das was a constant companion of Suresh Bansal after he checked into Baba Sagar Guest House, on the EM Bypass, with 90 relatives for his daughters wedding on July 1. The Bansals thought Das was an employee of the guest house, while the Baba Sagar authorities thought he was part of the marriage group.

 On July 1, Das allegedly burgled cash, ornaments and other valuables, worth more than Rs 8 lakh, from Suresh Bansals room while he and his relatives were at a hotel for the wedding reception. 

 Das is a smart operator. He befriended the Bansals in such a manner that the guest house authorities thought that he was part of the group, said Ajoy Kumar, the city detective chief. As a result, when he sought the keys at the guest house reception, it did not arouse suspicion.

 Das had stolen gold ornaments and cash in a similar operation in Ballygunge a few months back, said the police.

 According to the complaint lodged by Suresh Bansal, Das had stolen Rs 2.71 lakh in cash, gold ornaments worth around Rs 6.37 lakh and some Nepali currency from his room. The businessman said that a few hours after the guests left for the wedding, Das returned to the hotel and asked for the keys to Suresh Bansals room. He took everything valuable that he could find in the room and left within 15 minutes. While leaving the guest house, he returned the key to the receptionist, said an investigating officer.

 The police believe they will be able to recover the remaining stolen goods by interrogating Das.

 A 65-year-old roadside barber was killed and tea stall-owner injured when a portion of a three-storeyed, century-old building, Bengal Bonded Warehouse, on Strand Road, collapsed on Sunday evening.

 Nanda Kishore Thakur, from Patna, was caught under the rubble and died soon after, while Sitaram Yadav sustained injuries in his legs. It was around 6.30pm. On a working day, scores of cars would have been parked under the building and hundreds would have been thronging the adjacent stalls. 

 Witnesses said the top half of second floor collapsed during a shower. For several minutes, a dust cloud enveloped the surroundings. 

 We heard moans under the rubble and realised that it was the barber. I was standing a few yards away and had a narrow escape, said Santosh Kumar Chaurasia, who runs an eatery in the area.

 Weve decided to pull down a section of the building to avoid another accident. The civic officials have been informed. Until the demolition is complete, a stretch of Strand Road will remain barricaded, said Ajay Ranade, the deputy commissioner (central).

 Situated opposite a Calcutta Port Trust office and next to Mackinnon and Mackenzie Building, the portion of Bengal Bonded Warehouse has been uninhabitable since a fire broke out on December 20 last year. Most of the residents had either moved out or settled in the four other blocks of the building, which stretches up to NS Road. The owner, said local residents, lived on Masjid Bari Street and would rarely turn up. 

 The five blocks of the building have separate staircases and a common entrance. After the fire, the block facing Strand Road was abandoned. The other blocks house mostly offices. The families stay on the top floor, said Janmejoy Pandey, who has been living in the building for 17 years.

 Civic officials said the building could not be demolished because of a court case.

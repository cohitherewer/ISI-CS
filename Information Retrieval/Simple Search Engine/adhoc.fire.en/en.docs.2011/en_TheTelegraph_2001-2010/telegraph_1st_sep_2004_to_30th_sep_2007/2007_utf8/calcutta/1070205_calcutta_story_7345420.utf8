 Traders fight off civic staff

 OUR BUREAU

 Police allegedly lathicharged around 200 shop-keepers of the College Street market on Sunday morning, after they refused to allow civic employees to enter the complex to barricade certain stalls as part of renovation work.

 The traders, who were asked by Calcutta High Court to move to Marcus Square by January 31 to facilitate reconstruction of the market, alleged highhandedness by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) authorities.

 The court has ordered us to take the keys of our temporary stalls in Marcus Square, inspect the facilities there and submit a report on February 14. How can civic officials and police force us to vacate the stalls before that date, in violation of the court order? asked Dinesh Jaiswal, president of the College Street Dealers Association.

 The association will move court with a contempt petition on Monday.

 Rejecting the charge that the civic body had violated a court order, civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the team had gone to College Street not to demolish the market, but to barricade the stalls that have been vacated.

 Joint municipal commissioner Shahidul Islam said the court has not revised its earlier order asking the traders to temporarily shift to Marcus Square by January 31.

 On Friday, the traders deposed before the court that they could not relocate to Marcus Square as the CMC had not arranged for the basic amenities there.

 My clients are ready to shift to Marcus Square, but the CMC has not carried out the courts order by arranging the basic amenities, said counsel for the traders Siraj Gooptu.

 CMC counsel Aloke Ghosh, however, informed the court that all basic amenities had been put in place.

 Hearing both sides, Justice Soumitra Pal asked the traders to visit Marcus Square and submit a report to the court on the state of affairs there. The case will come up for hearing on February 14.

 Construction of the new College Street market to be called Suktara was to start in the first week of February.

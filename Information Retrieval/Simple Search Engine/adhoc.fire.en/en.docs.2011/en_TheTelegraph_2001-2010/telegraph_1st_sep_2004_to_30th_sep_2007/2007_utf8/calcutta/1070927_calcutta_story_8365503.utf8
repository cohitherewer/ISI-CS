 CID notice on Todis

 - Sleuths summon Priyanka and father, question Rizwanur colleagues

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ashok Todi

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Wednesday issued summons to Ashok Todi and his daughter Priyanka, directing them to be at the Bhabani Bhavan headquarters on Thursday. The notice was delivered at Todis Kalakar Street office, in Burrabazar.

 We tried to contact them over phone, but failed, as their cellphones were switched off. So we issued the notice, said Bhupinder Singh, the additional director-general of police (CID).

 The probe into the death of Rizwanur Rahman was handed over to the CID on Monday by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Rizwanur, 30, was found dead on the rail tracks between Dum Dum and Bidhannagar on September 21.

 Sleuths of the homicide wing on Wednesday recorded the statement of two youths, Swapnil Sengupta and Debraj Banerjee, who were Rizwanurs colleagues at a computer animation unit in Chowringhee.

 In their statement, Swapnil and Debraj narrated how the relationship between Rizwanur and Priyanka had developed. They said they came to know about their marriage after it was registered.

 After that, we often saw Rizwanur receiving calls from the Lalbazar police headquarters and knew how some officers were pressuring him to send Priyanka back to her parents. We would see him upset and disturbed, they said.

 CID officials also summoned Rukbanur, Rizwanurs elder brother, to Bhabani Bhavan to ask him more questions about the couple.

 They asked me in detail what had happened the day Ashok Todi visited our house after coming to know about the marriage, said Rukbanur. 

 Wednesday also saw members of the Association of Protection for Democratic Rights (APDR) marching in a rally from Rizwanurs Tiljala Lane house to College Square, demanding immediate suspension of all the policemen accused of meddling in the matter.

 I will file a case in the high court. What the policemen have done is criminal, said Sujato Bhadra of APDR, to whom Rizwanur had given a note mentioning how the police had been pressuring him to send Priyanka back.

 Social activist Mahasveta Devi visited Rizwanurs house and said: The police have unleashed a reign of terror. Strangely, the chief minister, who is also the police minister, has kept mum.

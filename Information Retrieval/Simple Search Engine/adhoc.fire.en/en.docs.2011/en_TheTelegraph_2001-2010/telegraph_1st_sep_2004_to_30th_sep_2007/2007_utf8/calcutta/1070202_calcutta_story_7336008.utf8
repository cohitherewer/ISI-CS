 After manhole covers, interlocking tiles on the pavements have emerged the target of thieves. As a result, the agencies responsible for laying the tiles and maintaining them are running up losses, forcing the civic authorities to consider alternative ways to do up the pavements.

 According to a Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) estimate, pavement tiles worth over Rs 5 lakh have either been stolen or damaged by vehicles. The number of thefts is increasing rapidly.

 Hardly 40 per cent of the 2,000-km-long city pavements is covered with tiles. The laying of the tiles cost the CMC Rs 193 per square metre. Each tile costs between Rs 30 and Rs 40. Stolen tiles are sold for Rs 10.

 Camac Street, AJC Bose Road, Gariahat, Sealdah, Mullickbazar, Bentinck Street, RN Mukherjee Road and Narkeldanga are the areas where most of the tile thefts have taken place.

 Following discussions with mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has held several rounds of talks with civic engineers to identify an alternative.

 The model followed in Johannesburg figured in the talks. According to deputy chief engineer Soumitra Bhattacharya, pavements in the South African city are bordered with two rows of bricks with rectangular concrete slabs on white sand in between. The slabs do not have iron or steel armatures and so, no resale value.

 Utility services will not need to dig up the pavements if this system is adopted.

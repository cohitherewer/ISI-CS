The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Nostalgic with no baggage

 An FM radio channel campaign evokes the past to connect with now

 Nostalgia makes one dysfunctional. It dulls the power to handle today. The mind meanders through the alleys of past. Worse still, sometimes something in the present begs you to be nostalgic. A recent campaign which was brewed in this city did just that to many of us.

 There was a time not so long back, when this city was a centre of excellence in advertising. Old timers would recollect the national adulation that the Made for Each Other campaign received for Wills Filter Tipped. The city then housed big spenders like Brooke Bond and Lipton, Reckitt and Colman and Bata. Naturally many great campaigns were created from this city. Then the wheel turned. Deep pockets changed their residence. Talent migrated. Staple for the native consumers became poor translations of campaigns that were thought in other languages and were meant for other mindsets.

 It is in this gloomy backdrop that a new campaign appeared as lightning on the city sky a few weeks back. The campaign launched a new FM radio channel Friends FM 91.9. It started by teasing us. It picked as its spine the lyrics of a famous song. The number sung by Manna De (picture above at College Street Coffee House) says Coffee houser shei adda ta ar nei (the adda that we used to have in the Coffee House is no longer there). It goes on to lament the loss of contact with dear friends. One of the friends is now in Paris, someone else has passed away, there are only memories of the others. The teaser campaign used these lines. The visual backdrop was a half-lit shot of the chairs and tables in the College Street coffee house. In picking the song, the creators of this advertising added a dimension to the name of the FM channel Friends FM. It brought in nostalgia. It brought back memories of those good old days in the coffee house or the friendly neighbourhood tea stall. 

 The marriage of the product theme (Friends FM) and the campaign, through a popular song on friendship, is not necessarily great. Many may call it an obvious connection. The creators of the campaign, fortunately for us, were not happy with just a good campaign. Their aim was to create a great one. They first added a simple two-word tagline to the teasers. Some said Chole ay, another said Ashchhish to. All meant the same let us do it again. They did not forget the ad that had the line about guitarist Dsouza who has passed away the tag line simply said Toke miss korbo (Will miss you). Then came the launch ad the setting remained the same, but the visuals became brighter. The cups on the coffee house table signified today rather than the day before. The copy maintained its friendly tone.

 Most crucially, it promised the ultimate yesterday once more (shei adda shei gaan aj abar). As if they were launching not an FM channel, but re-launching Calcutta and its culture. The campaign banked on nostalgia but brilliantly managed the baggage of past. They offered those golden days again through the product Friends FM 91.9 which professed later pal, this music is for you. It is important to remember two contributing factors the channel is owned locally and the responsibility of creating the campaign was entrusted to an advertising agency whose creative team have their roots firmly embedded in the bylanes of this city. The result was perhaps inevitable. We, the Calcuttans, were treated to a masterpiece.

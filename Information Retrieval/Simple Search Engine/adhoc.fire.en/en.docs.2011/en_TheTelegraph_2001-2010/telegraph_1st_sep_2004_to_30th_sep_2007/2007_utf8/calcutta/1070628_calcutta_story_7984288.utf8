The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Probe nails cop for banana boy assault

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Chandan Sau: Beaten up for Rs 2. A Telegraph picture 

Subedar Harendra Nath Panchal had beaten up fruit vendor Chandan Sau, though its yet to be established whether the cop had refused to pay the 18-year-old the price of a banana.

 This was the crux of the report filed by a team from Shakespeare Sarani police station that probed Tuesday afternoons incident on Camac Street.

 The report has been sent to the top brass of the Fourth Battalion of Calcutta police, to which Panchal is attached. Another round of inquiry will be held before taking any action against Panchal.

 We have completed our inquiry and it is up to the battalion concerned to find out whether the allegations were true or not and take necessary steps, said Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner (south). There has been no complaint yet against Panchal.

 Hiren Das, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani thana, urged witnesses who had spoken to the media on Tuesday to help police in the probe.

 Chandan, a Taltala resident, went to the police booth at the gate of the British Council where Panchal was sitting and asked him to pay Rs 2, the price of a banana that the subedar had just taken from him.

 According to witnesses, that was provocation enough for Panchal to slap Chandan in his face and kick him in the stomach.

 As Chandan managed to wriggle himself free and return to his stall, crying in pain, those around raided the picket, dragged out Panchal and assaulted him. Police had to rescue him from the mob.

 On Wednesday, neither was Panchal posted in the picket nor could Chandan be seen in his stall.

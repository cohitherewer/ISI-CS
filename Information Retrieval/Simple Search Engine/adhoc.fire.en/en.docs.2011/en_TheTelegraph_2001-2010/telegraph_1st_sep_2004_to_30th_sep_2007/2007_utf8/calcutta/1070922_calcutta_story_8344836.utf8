 CBSE drops marks mode

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Grades will fully replace marks in the Class X exams of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) from 2009. The present practice is to award both grades and marks to examinees.

 The system will also be introduced in the CBSE Class XII exams after 2009, but gradually.

 Most education authorities in the country including the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations and the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education award both grades and marks.

 The decision to abolish marks is linked to the CBSEs attempt to usher in a stress-free learning process in schools, board chairman Ashoke Ganguly said on Friday. Our curriculum and examination system will undergo a total transformation to achieve the objective.

 Ganguly was in Calcutta to discuss the makeover blueprint with the principals of CBSE schools in the eastern and northeastern states.

 A committee set up by the board has evolved a nine-point grading scale after consulting experts from the Indian Statistical Institute, IIMs and IITs.

 The model is being examined by the Union human resources development ministry. We will start implementing it after receiving the approval, said Ganguly.

 The grading pattern will vary from subject to subject. Students usually score more in mathematics and science subjects than, say, in literature. The grading pattern has been devised keeping that in mind. For instance, if grade A stands for marks between 94 and 100 in mathematics, it will represent 87-90 in a less-scoring subject, Ganguly explained.

 As part of its restructuring plan, the board will also introduce internal assessment for the students of classes X and XII. The board chairman announced that 20 per cent of the questions in the Class X and Class XII exams will be multiple-choice and short-answer type.

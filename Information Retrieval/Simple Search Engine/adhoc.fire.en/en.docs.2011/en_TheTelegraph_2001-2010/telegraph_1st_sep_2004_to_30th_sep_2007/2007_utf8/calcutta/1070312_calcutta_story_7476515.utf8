 How does a book called Naissance des Fantomes (Birth of Phantoms) become Amar Bhoutik Swami in its Bengali translation? Marie Darrieussecq offers a smile as an answer. Then she points to the English version My Phantom Husband. It is not a bad title, she reflects. My publishers thought the French original was too intellectual and scary for commercial purposes. I let go. Titles do not matter.

 Darrieussecq has a store of experience with regard to translations ever since her first book Truismes was published in 1996. It was a story of a woman transforming into a pig. The English version was called Pig Tales. That was a good solution, as truis means a sow, or a female pig. But many other languages had bad solutions. She lists out how the Spanish title Maranadas meant prostitution and Schweinerei in German was dirty things indicating pornography. Who knows what it was in Chinese or Russian? she shrugs.

 Darrieussecqs story of the phantom husband was launched in Calcutta, in Bengali, last month. Yes, it is a supernatural book. But above all, it is about how a woman can cope alone. There are resonances from her life in the book, but nothing of the kind one can imagine. I was caught in a boring marriage but lacked the strength to tell my husband or to face a life alone. Writing the book was like a therapy, she declares. 

 In the book, the husband vanishes and as people try to calm the wife, she gradually realises that what is missing is not the husband but her inner strength. There is a way of caring for a man without dependence. After the book, she ended the marriage.

 But Darrieussecq is not happy just to keep a story at an individual level. It has to have a link with the world. 

 Her vehicle is the metaphor. So, if her novel has the woman falling in love with a werewolf, it is a commentary on animal instincts of society and its politics. The problem of Algerian decolonisation, for instance, is not solved in France. It is in the air. The ghost in the novel is a metaphor of everything that is hidden. You cannot see it, but you sense it.

 In Calcutta, she walked around the markets and Howrah station. You can feel the atmosphere of a city in these places. The journey yielded two kg of plastic toys for her children. But she is not done yet. Next on her list is a Ganesha. I love the elephant god, says the author, who deals in myriad metamorphoses.

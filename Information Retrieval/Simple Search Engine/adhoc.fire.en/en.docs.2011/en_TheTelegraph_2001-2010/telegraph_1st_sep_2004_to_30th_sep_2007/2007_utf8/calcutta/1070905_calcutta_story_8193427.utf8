 Diabetes twin on the rise

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 A potentially dangerous liver ailment, known as a sister disease of diabetes, is on the rise in Calcutta. It is often not diagnosed because of a lack of awareness among patients as well as doctors. 

 Three hundred adults half of them diabetic, the others pre-diabetic were the subject of a six-month study completed recently at the Post Graduate Medical Education and Research in SSKM. 

 At least 45 per cent of both groups were found to suffer from excessive deposition of fat in the liver, known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is potentially dangerous, said Satinath Mukherjee, an associate professor of the institute. In almost all the cases, the patients had central obesity or a paunch.

 Diabetes causes insulin deficiency and resistance in the body. Insulin deposits blood fat into skeletal muscles or special tissues called adipose tissues. When the body develops insulin resistance, the fat is deposited in the liver.

 There is no medicine to clear fat from the liver, said Mukherjee, the honorary secretary of the Diabetic Association of India.

 P.S. Chattopadhyay, the head of the endocrine, nutrition and metabolic diseases department at the School of Tropical Medicine (STM), said: We are getting an increasing number of diabetics suffering from NAFLD. Unfortunately, awareness about the disease is low even among doctors.

 According to STM data, NAFLD has gone up by nearly 50 per cent in the city over a year. It can lead to non-viral hepatitis, cirrhosis and cancer. Nearly 10 per cent NAFLD patients suffer cirrhosis of liver, said Chattopadhyay.

 Prevention and diagnosis is the only way out for NAFLD patients. Diabetic and pre-diabetic patients should regularly undergo tests, he added. Exercise and low-fat diet can help.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Duty-free stocks dry up

 - Contract expiry has airport shops minus liquor, cigarettes or chocolates

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Popular brands of liquor have vanished from the duty-free shops at the airport. Cigarettes and chocolates, too, are not available. Only a few brands of perfumes are drawing customers to the outlets at the departure and arrival lounges of the international terminal for the past two months. 

 Its going to remain this way till July, when a private agency will take charge of the stores. The contract of the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), which runs the shops now, will expire on May 31. Hence, it has not replenished the dwindling stocks.

 We started running out of stocks a couple of months ago and are not placing fresh orders. We are just waiting for the leftover goods to be sold, said an ITDC official. There were 1,000 to 1,200 cases of liquor (each containing 12 one-litre bottles) at the warehouse even a few months back. Now, there are only about 100 cases.

 With stocks of popular brands of liquor and cigarettes exhausted, the men at the counters have been regularly facing complaints from passengers. The monthly turnover of the store has dropped from Rs 40lakh two months ago to Rs 10lakh, said the ITDC official.

 Rajesh Gidwani, a city-based businessman who flew to Bangkok on Jet Airways on May 18, said: I asked for Johnnie Walker Black Label and Bells at the duty-free shop in the departure lounge, but the attendant said there was no stock.

 According to sources, the ITDC did not bid for the contract because of the high licence fee. It is paying Rs 2.5crore as annual fee for the two stores. We did not take part in the global tender for the contract, confirmed an ITDC official.

 We awarded the contract for running the stores to a private company after a global tender. The company will take a little time to start operations, said an official of the Airports Authority of India. The shop will be closed after May 31 till the company assumes charge. 

 The ITDC contract for the stores, commissioned in 1968, officially ended on March 31 this year. The tourism corporation was given a two-month extension. The new company will take over in July, said a senior airport official.

 Trader Mohammad Mobin, 30, was killed and at least 11 other passengers were injured on Sunday morning when a minibus overturned as its driver tried to avoid hitting a child running across the road. 

 The bus, on the Shyambazar-Metiabruz route, met with the accident around 8.40 am on the downward slope of the Vidyasagar Setu ramp that connects Commissariat Road with the junction of St Georges Gate Road and AJC Bose Road. The driver fled.

 The bus was travelling at a high speed. The child, about six years old, ran across the road near the intersection of St Georges Gate Road and AJC Bose Road. The driver suddenly slammed the brakes, causing the vehicle to overturn, said an officer of Vidyasagar Setu traffic guard.

 Bystanders rescued the trapped passengers. Officers of the traffic guard arranged to have the injured taken to SSKM Hospital. Mobin, a bachelor who lived in Colootola, died in hospital.

The bus has been sent for tests. We found the rubber coat on the front set of tyres had worn away, said another officer. According to a section of bystanders, the bus was speeding when it overturned. They set up a blockade on the road, demanding that traffic lights be made manual from automatic and speedbreakers be raised on the ramp leading to the intersection.

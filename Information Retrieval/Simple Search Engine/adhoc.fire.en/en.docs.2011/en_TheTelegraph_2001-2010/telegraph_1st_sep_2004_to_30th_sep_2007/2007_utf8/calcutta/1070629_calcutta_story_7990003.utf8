 Brother dupes NRI of lakhs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man has been arrested for allegedly stealing Rs 21 lakh from his NRI brothers bank account over a year. His wife, an alleged partner in the crime, is absconding.

 We arrested Ashok Roy, a resident of Indu Biswas Road, on June 24, after receiving a formal complaint from his brother Subroto Roy, said Hiren Das, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 Subroto, who is settled in Texas, was operating a savings bank account from Calcutta, and had authorised his brother Ashok to maintain the account.

 He arrived in Calcutta in March to discover that Ashok had been siphoning off money from his account, said the officer.

 Ashok, who dealt in share brokerage and investments, regularly withdrew money for a year to buy himself a car and a house in Salt Lake.

 He also kept transferring a considerable amount to wife Mahaswetas account, through cheques bearing his signature, the officer said.

 Subroto didnt want his brother arrested, but after several domestic squabbles in which Ashoks wife Mahasweta vehemently defended her husband he lodged a complaint with the police.

 We suspect Ashoks wife to be a party to the crime. We hope to arrest her soon, said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani thana.

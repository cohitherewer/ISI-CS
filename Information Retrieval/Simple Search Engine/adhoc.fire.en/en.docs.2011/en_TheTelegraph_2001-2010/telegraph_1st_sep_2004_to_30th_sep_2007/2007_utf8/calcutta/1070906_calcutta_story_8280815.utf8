 Office overstay brawl

 - Four officials of drug firm held on complaint by ex-employee

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four officials of a pharmaceutical company were arrested on Wednesday on the basis of a complaint by a former employee, who said he was beaten up and forced to resign for not staying late in office.

 The arrested four, who were complainant Ashoke Saus bosses in the city office of the Mumbai-based company, insisted that they had asked him to leave as his performance was poor and he was not working hard enough.

 Sau, who was a sales representative of the company, asserted that he did not want to quit his job but was physically forced into doing so. 

 He lodged the complaint with Bidhannagar (North) police station on Wednesday morning.

 They kept me locked in the companys regional office in BD block, in Salt Lake, and forced me to sign a letter stating that I had resigned voluntarily. They even forced me to sign on a blank paper, alleged Sau. 

 He, however, admitted that his performance had not been up to the mark and unlike other employees, he would not work till late in office.

 It was not possible for me to stay in office till 2am to please my bosses. But that is what they wanted and made me do. They forced me to stay late in office and work.

 A. Biswas, the additional superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, said: We arrested Narayan Das, Prasenjit Saha, Amaresh Das and Hemanta Ghosh on the basis of the complaint.

 The officer added that the four included the regional manager and an assistant general manager of the company, which has its headquarters in Andheri.

 We have charged them with wrongfully forcing an employee to perform his duty, stated the officer.

 The four were produced in the additional judicial magistrates court in Salt Lake and let out on bail.

 Narayan Das, the divisional sales manager of the company, said Sau had been asked to leave because his performance was below par. He did not work hard enough and failed to meet his targets and deadlines, said Das.

 The sales manager described the charge of assaulting Sau as concocted. 

 He said: The question of beating up Sau does not arise. He was a reluctant worker and did nothing to increase sales. We insisted that he leave as we could not meet our targets because of him. We were being hauled up by our head office because of him.

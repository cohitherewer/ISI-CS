 False pledge for honesty

 PRONAB MONDAL

He set an example of honesty. He was rewarded with false promises.

 In October 2003, Ajit Guha (picture right) was manning traffic on Rabindra Sarani, near Lalbazar, when he found a bag containing Rs 1,26,550. The resident of Gobardanga, in North 24-Parganas, immediately took the bag to his superiors.

 They lauded Guha for his act. Others, too, offered to help the home guard, the sole earning member of a family of four, consisting of his cancer-stricken wife and two children. Not a single promise was kept.

 The owner of a shoe shop on Rabindra Sarani, Tej Pratap Singh, whose bag Guha had returned, gave him money and four pairs of sandals, said the policeman in his late-40s.

 Guhas name was also recommended for promotion, but he chose to appear for the departmental examination instead. He secured promotion to the post of constable a few months ago.

 According to Guha, a number of people met him and called up at his office, saying they would like to help meet the expenses of his wifes treatment. But nobody turned up later. I do not expect them to help. I will win my own battle, asserted Guha.

 He struggles to meet the expenses of educating his children and buying medicines for his wife, but will not think twice about returning a bag full of cash again.

 We are proud of him. Guha did the right thing, but he did not get the recognition he deserves from society, said Banibrata Basu, who was joint commissioner (traffic) when Guha returned the bag.

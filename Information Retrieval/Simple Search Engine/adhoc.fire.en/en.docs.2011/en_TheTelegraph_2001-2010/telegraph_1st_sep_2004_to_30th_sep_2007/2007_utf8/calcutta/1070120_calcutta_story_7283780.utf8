 Now Diamond Trading Corporation (DTC), part of the De Beers group, is adding a sparkle all its own to what has turned into one of the most sought-after commodities in the market art.

 At the launch of Forevermark an identification mark unique to each diamond and inscribed on the table facet of the sparkler in the Ballroom of the Oberoi Grand on Thursday evening, actor Tom Alter, sporting a silver beard and a tuxedo, did the honours. 

 Artists and well-heeled socialites sat around the candle-lit tables, imbibing and speaking in stage whispers. Alter, who appeared on the dais amidst a cloud of smoke, announced that to commemorate the global launch of this insignia, DTC rocks will flaunt the cachet of art.

 Four canvases by Ganesh Haloi, Prabhakar Kolte, Manu Parekh and Yusuf Arakkal will first be previewed at similar parties in Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai, where they will go under the hammer at Indigo on February 6 evening. The proceeds of the auction will be donated to Laadli, an NGO dedicated to the cause of the girl child.

 The preview of the canvases was preceded by a dance performance accompanied by a laser show in true Gemini Circus style. The dancers had been flown in from Austria, it was given to understand.

 Geetu Hinduja, platinum-haired and kohl-eyed, who runs the art consultancy firm Fine Art Company and was responsible for bringing the four canvases together, said the base price of these canvases is between Rs 22 lakh and Rs 25 lakh, which is the current market rate of the Fab Four.

 The works are from collectors and the artists concerned as well. So 20 per cent of the takings of the auction will go to charity.

 As a bonus, the buyer of each canvas will be gifted a diamond, each rock priced at Rs 5 lakh. Not till February 6 will we get to know who will get these four diamonds forever.

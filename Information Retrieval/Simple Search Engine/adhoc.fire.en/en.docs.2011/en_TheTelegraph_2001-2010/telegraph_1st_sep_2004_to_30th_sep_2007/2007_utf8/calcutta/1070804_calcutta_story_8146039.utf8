 Act wins woman upkeep 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Alipore court on Friday ordered a man to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 900 to his wife under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2006.

 The woman, Aparna Bharati, a resident of Behala, had accused husband Asit of sexually abusing her.

 This was the first instance in the state of a court delivering a maintenance order under the act. Usually, such an order is issued when a woman seeks alimony.

 After Aparna had lodged her complaint, the court asked police to restore peace in the family without harassing the husband, a former army officer. But the peace move failed, with Asit leaving his Behala home for his native village in Nandigram. He took with him the ration card, the register book for cooking gas and Aparnas clothes.

 Judge Moumita Bhattacharya of Alipore court ordered Asit, who gets a pension of Rs 2,100, to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 900 to his wife and also return the items to her.

 The judge said if Asit failed to pay the money to Bharati, he would be asked to submit it to the court.

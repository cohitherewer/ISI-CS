 A three-year-old girl was burnt to death and her five-year-old brother was seriously injured after their mother allegedly tried to set them and herself on fire in Maniktala on Wednesday morning. 

 Mamata Ghosh, in her 20s, and her son were admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Their condition was stated to be critical.

 According to neighbours, financial crisis might have triggered the incident. The womans husband, Gopal Ghosh, is a daily wage earner and it was difficult for Mamata to make ends meet with his earnings. Unable to handle the situation she might have tried to kill herself as well as her two children, said an officer investigating the incident.

 Neighbours said the couple had a fight last night over their financial troubles, added the officer. 

 Mamatas parents, however, lodged a complaint with Maniktala police station alleging that she was set ablaze by her husband.

 Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said: The burnt woman was not in a position to answer questions. If her statement corroborates the allegation, action will be initiated against the accused.

 The incident took place around 11.30am when residents of Canal East Road noticed smoke billowing out of a house. They rushed there to find one of the rooms bolted from inside. Mamata, her son Pritam and daughter Prerna were heard screaming inside the room.

 The neighbours broke open the door and found the three on fire, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). They doused the flames with the help of jute bags and blankets, he added.

 Prerna was charred. Mamata received 80 per cent burns. Pratim was also badly injured, said an officer of the police station. 

 Gopal, who was not at home, rushed back but ran away fearing an attack by the neighbours. He later visited his wife and son in hospital.

 Doctors said that Mamata and Pritam would be kept under observation for the next two days.

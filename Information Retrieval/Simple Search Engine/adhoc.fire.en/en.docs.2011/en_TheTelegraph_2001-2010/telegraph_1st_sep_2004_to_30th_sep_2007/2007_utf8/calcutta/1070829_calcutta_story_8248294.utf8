 Campus banner for Bangla students

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Members of two students bodies in Presidency College and Jadavpur University (JU) on Tuesday organised a poster campaign in support of the agitating students of Bangladesh and condemning violence in city colleges.

 Independents Consolidation in Presidency and the Forum for Arts Students in JU, under the banner of United Students Democratic Front, pledged support to the Bangladeshi students protesting against the army-backed interim government in the country.

 We have always raised our voice against state terrorism and we want to do the same for Bangladesh by supporting the students protesting there, said Rakesh Banerjee, a third-year economics honours student of Presidency.

 The students also demanded that violence in colleges in and around the city be contained. Three students of a college in New Barrackpore were beaten up last week, allegedly by SFI members, for writing anti-establishment pieces in a little magazine. 

 According to the students, the trio were beaten up with hockey sticks, locked up in the union room and made to swallow glue. They were admitted to a hospital, where the doctors asked them to get a CT scan and X-ray done, said Lokeshwari Dasgupta, second-year history honours student of Jadavpur University, who took part in Tuesdays programme. The three have been discharged from hospital.

 The students have not gone public about the incident fearing repercussions, said Dipanjan Sinha, the general secretary of Presidency College Students Union.

 On Monday, two students of the Forum for Independent Students were allegedly beaten up by SFI members for putting up posters condemning the police firing in Khammam in Scottish Church College.

 We are planning a rally in support of the students in Bangladesh and condemning violence against students not just in Bangladesh but also in colleges here, said Banerjee.

 Retail chain Spencers on Friday launched its first small store in Calcutta. It will open at least nine such stores, catering to daily needs, in the city in the next eight weeks.

 The company, owned by RPG Enterprises, is the latest entrant in the hypermarket scene in the city. 

 The first small Spencers store was inaugurated on Ballygunge Circular Road. It is an Express outlet, the smallest in the chains stable. Spread over 800 to 1,200 sq ft, these stores stock fruits, vegetables, groceries, processed food, personal care products and other household items.

 The focus is on convenience. The store is positioned to fulfil a customers shopping needs in minutes, said senior vice-president (operation) of Spencers Retail Ramesh Menon, after the inauguration of the store.

 The idea is to reach out to the customers. To do that, we are also introducing the home delivery concept in a big way, added Menon.

 The stores will have a dedicated telephone number where one can register orders. The delivery will be free within a radius of a couple of kilometres.

 The company is trying to project the outlets as stores next door that would take the place of the neighbourhood grocer for the family on the move.

 The chain also launched a bigger store, part of the Spencers Daily format, in north Calcutta on Friday.

 Spread over 2,000 sq ft, the store on Bangur Avenue will stock every conceivable product required by a household on a daily basis. 

 It is the third large Spencers store in Calcutta. The other two stores are in Tollygunge and Beleghata.

 Future Group, which owns the Pantaloons retail chain, is the biggest player in the hypermarket arena in the city. Local group C3 is another notable name in the field.

 The competition in this space is expected to hot up once Mukesh Ambani brings the Reliance Fresh convenience stores to the city. The company is facing political opposition in Bengal, but will reportedly stick to the June launch schedule.

 Spencers, too, has aggressive plans for Bengal, comprising 20 outlets by the end of 2007, including three Spencers Hyperstore the biggest format in Calcutta, said Menon.

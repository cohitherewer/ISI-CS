The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Illegal? Its El Dorado out there

 DEATH TRAP ROW: 50 Kustia Road rubs shoulders with identical, illegal buildings, the sort that dot the Topsia-Tangra-Tiljala triangle, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. A Telegraph picture

 The civic body has slapped a notice on the killer building at 50 Kustia Road, from whose top floor an iron rod fell on 18-year-old Munna Pandey and killed him last week. Local politicians and policemen have hatched a compensation plan for the Pandey family. But no one wants to touch the bigger issue of illegal buildings.

 Metro takes a closer look at the frequently-asked questions about the mushrooming of illegal buildings, money-spinners for police, politicians and the civic body. 

 Q1) Where will you find these illegal buildings? 

 The triangle of Tiljala, Topsia and Tangra, off EM Bypass, hosts the highest concentration of illegal constructions in the city. 

 Q2) What is an illegal building? 

 Constructions undertaken without the mandatory seal of approval of building plans by the civic body are illegal, for which no registration is done and mutation records are not available with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 

 Q3) What is illegal about the buildings here?

 From building plan to materials used everything about the pigeonhole flats is flawed. The buildings are structurally weak due to the high sand to cement ratio of 10:1. These buildings do not have legitimate water, sewerage and electricity connections and depend on a parallel distribution network run by local youth for civic amenities.

 Q4) How many illegal buildings are here?

 The number of buildings without mandatory approvals is around 50,000.

 Q5) What happens in these illegal buildings?

 The buildings are used as residential-cum-commercial estates. Promoters prefer to sell off space to owners of leather and rubber factories, who set up units to produce export items, like fancy bags and wallets. These sweatshops employ child labourers, who slog for over 16 hours a day.

 Q6) What is the economics behind the mushrooming of illegal buildings and sweatshops?

 Cost advantage in setting up factories is fuelling the boom, as space is available in the area at a rate as low as Rs 400 per sq ft. Besides, a steady stream of labourers, willing to work at a subsistence wage, from the districts and the neighbouring states make it the most attractive area to set up sweatshops.

 Q7) How does one go about constructing an illegal building/floor?

 Identify the plot, rope in the local councillor or an influential political leader as patron. Get the cops on board to push the project faster. The leader identifies the suppliers of building materials, while the promoter scouts for buyers, who pay in advance. This advance in some cases, the full amount takes care of the construction cost and the penniless promoter rakes in a supernormal profit, which gets shared.

 Q8) What is the going rate for leaders and cops? 

 Local police get Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per illegal floor, while local leaders bless the illegal buildings by charging Rs 65 per sq ft.

 Q9) What is the danger posed by these buildings?

 No structural safety, poor ventilation, dark and cramped staircase, exposed electric wires, absence of proper sanitation death trap is how one can describe them. On November 22, one such building, at 33C Topsia Road, caught fire from an illegal leather bag-making unit and 11 labourers were charred to death.

 Q10) What do the CMC, police and politicians have to say about illegal building?

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya: Illegal construction in the area should be stopped But in a democratic set-up, we cannot demolish the houses with a bulldozer. However, we will take some action. 

 Local councillor and MLA Javed Ahmed Khan: Construction of illegal buildings is a source of income for CPM leaders in the area. Despite specific complaints, the CMC has not taken any action against illegal buildings.

 Officer, Tiljala police station: We alone cannot stop illegal construction We need support from the CMC and political leaders.

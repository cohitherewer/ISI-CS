 in wind flow. The minimum temperature in Calcutta on Tuesday 

 was 14.7 degree Celsius. On Monday, the minimum temperature 

 was 17.1 degree. The sky has cleared again and the North 

 Wind has started blowing. We expect the minimum temperature 

 to drop further by two degrees in the next couple of days, 

 said a Met official.

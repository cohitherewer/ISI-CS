 JU vows to shun strike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The battle lines have been drawn at Jadavpur University (JU). The Students Federation of India (SFI) has called a students strike (schools exempted) in the city on Monday over violence on the campus but the students unions of the universitys three faculties are bent on classes being held.

 Our supporters have worked hard for three days to mobilise the student community of Calcutta. Numerous processions were taken out across the state to generate awareness among students about the vandalism and arson that took place at JU on Thursday. We expect tomorrows strike to be successful, said president of the SFI state committee Sudip Sengupta on Sunday. 

 Members of JU Karmachari Sansad, the office of which was vandalised on Thursday, along with the adjacent Science Club, held a protest meeting outside the campus, near the 8B bus stand, on Sunday. Over 100 policeman patrolled the area to maintain peace.

 Forum for Arts Students that won the JU arts faculty election, Democratic Students Front, which won the engineering department polls, and We the Independents that formed the science faculty union decided at a general body meeting on Saturday night to oppose the strike.

 The only way to restore normalcy on the campus is to ensure that the academic process is not disrupted, asserted the three victorious unions.

 The SFI has been voted out by the students. We are confident that without the support of the students, the SFI strike will be unsuccessful, said Amit Chakraborty, general secretary of the faculty of engineering and technology students union.

 Questioned about the voices of dissent in JU, Sengupta said: We hope there will be no provocation leading to clashes with supporters of any organisation. The strike is intended to be a peaceful one. 

 The anti-SFI students bodies have demanded steps by the JU authorities to ensure that the students who want to attend classes on Monday are not stopped.

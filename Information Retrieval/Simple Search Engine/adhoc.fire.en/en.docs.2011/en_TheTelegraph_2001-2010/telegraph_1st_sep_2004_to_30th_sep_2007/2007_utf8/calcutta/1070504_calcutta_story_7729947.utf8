The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Swadesh Chakraborty

 Chairman, Hooghly

 River Bridge Commissioners, and MP, Howrah

 The pressure on Howrah bridge has reduced considerably after the second Hooghly bridge came up. Traffic congestion used to be a regular feature on Howrah bridge. Now it is a thing of the past. Surely the volume of vehicles has reduced. Removing trams from Howrah bridge was a step forward in the reduction of pressure. Trams were causing damage to the bridge. The second Vivekananda bridge is now under construction. After the bridge is opened to public, pressure on Howrah bridge will further reduce. The goods trucks from Benaras Road that cross Howrah bridge to reach north Bengal can travel through second Vivekananda bridge. The first Vivekananda Setu is now closed to heavy vehicles.

 Racket in fake marksheets

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A fake marksheet racket operating from Jharkhand has come to light, on the heels of the medical entrance scam. 

 The racket provided fake marksheets for admission to undergraduate courses across the country. The Calcutta University registrar had filed a complaint in June claiming that two students, Mousumi Dhali and Preety Gupta, had secured admission in affiliated colleges last year using fake marksheets.

 Both had got the marksheets from a fictitious institution named Ranchi Academic Council. The students are absconding.

 It will take us some time to find out the reach of the racket. Mousumi and her father Lalit have secured anticipatory bail from the high court, said Ajoy Kumar, the city detective chief. 

 Mousumi, a resident of Sakuntala Park, had secured admission in Mahestala College in a BA course while Preety Gupta, who lives in Picnic Garden, had taken admission in Heramba Chandra College in the political science honours course. 

 There was no way to make out that Preetys marksheet was fake. She had attended classes for over a year and was set to take the university exam under 1+1+1 scheme, said Khagen Adhikari, the principal of Heramba Chandra College. 

 The marksheets had been sent to Jharkhand Academic Council for verification. It confirmed after nine months that they were fake.

 As soon as we received the verification report, we handed over the certificates to the police for investigation, said Samir Bandyopadhyay, the Calcutta University registrar.

 According to officials of Heramba Chandra College, the university had issued Preetys admit card while waiting for the verification report. After the marksheet was found to be fake, the admit card was not handed over to her.

 Preety and her parents abused me and even threatened to move court, said Adhikari.

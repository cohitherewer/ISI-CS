 The parents of Soumik Basu the student who died last year amidst escalating campus violence at Bengal Engineering College and Science University (Besu), Shibpur filed a petition in Calcutta High Court against the university on Thursday, demanding a compensation of Rs 1crore.

 The petitioners, Ashoke Kumar Basu and Gita Basu, alleged that the university authorities had failed to provide security to their son and had tried to suppress the events relating to his death by passing it off as a suicide. 

 They also requested the court to ask the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to speed up the probe report of the case, which is yet to be filed.

 On August 8, 2006, Soumik, a third-year engineering student, sustained serious injuries in his chest after he fell from the second-floor terrace of hostel no. 11. He succumbed to his injuries in a city hospital four days later. 

 Soumik was the victim of a clash between two rival students unions, and the university should be taken to task for failing to save their son, the parents alleged.

 When Soumiks mother and sister visited him in hospital on August 9, 2006, they had not noticed any injury marks on his chest, as later stated in the police report, said the parents. 

 The terrace, from which the university authorities claimed that he had willingly jumped, is adjacent to the building in which he used to stay. Around 9.30pm, Soumik had told me over the phone that he was in his room because of a power cut. His voice had sounded normal. And I find it impossible to believe that he would go to the terrace of another building to commit suicide at 10pm, for no apparent reason, said the father.

 Junior standing counsel of the West Bengal government, Subrata Mukhopaddhaya, who appeared on behalf of Besu, said: The parents should be thankful to Besu for the role it had played after the incident, rather than trump up a charge against the university.

 The Besu authorities had incurred the entire expenditure for the cremation of the student and had requested the state government for a CID enquiry, said Mukhopaddhaya. He admitted that student turmoil had been a major issue on the campus when Soumik died, as rival students groups had clashed on the campus and in hostels. But, after interrogating the students, the university authorities had been forced to conclude that the boy had committed suicide, the advocate claimed. 

 The petition will be considered by Justice Dipankar Dutta in a couple of days.

 Journey into trance music

 A remarkable singer, composer and songwriter of great originality, Rgis Gizavos lyrical, flamboyant style makes him one of the foremost accordionists of today. Associated with Gizavo for over a decade, David Mirandons meeting with the former has been a key, determinant factor in the style and approach of the latter as a percussionist. Featuring Rgis Gizavo (accordion-vocals; picture far right) and David Mirandon (drums-percussion; picture right) this evenings summit meeting between these two exceptional musicians, promises to take the audience on a melodious, emotional journey into trance. Primitive and erudite, rugged and sophisticated and tinted with jazz, blues and soul, their music draws upon musical sources of southern Africa and the Indian Ocean region. Solemn or joyful, the melancholy songs are sung in Shona, Zulu and Malagasy. Hosted by The French Association, French Embassy in India, in collaboration with Seagrams, Princeton Club and Open Doors.

 Event: Music concert featuring Rgis 

 Gizavo and David Mirandon When: Today 

 at 7.30 pm Where: Princeton Club

 Widow held for fraud in PVD office

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A public vehicles department (PVD) employee was arrested at her north Calcutta home on Tuesday for misappropriating funds to the tune of Rs 54,000. She has been remanded in judicial custody.

 Annapurna Ghosh got the job in the PVDs cash section in 1993, after her husband, who was a motor vehicles inspector, died in harness.

 She was suspended in October last year after an inquiry by a joint secretary in the transport department found her guilty of embezzlement of funds.

 We had lodged an FIR with Ballygunge police station following the suspension. Police began a probe and finally picked her up from her Bhupen Bose Avenue residence. She has been charged with cheating and committing a criminal breach of trust, PVD director Md. Kamran said on Thursday.

 He claimed a PVD employee had never been arrested in recent times for misappropriation of funds.

 An official in the department said a random check of the records revealed that Ghosh had not deposited the entire amount she had collected from owners of heavy vehicles against the issuance of permits.

 Almost every day, she would take home a huge amount of cash. This was revealed after a few vehicle owners were summoned to our Beltala office and questioned about their payment, he added.

 Police said Ghosh, who comes from a well-to-do family, has a daughter who is a postgraduate student.

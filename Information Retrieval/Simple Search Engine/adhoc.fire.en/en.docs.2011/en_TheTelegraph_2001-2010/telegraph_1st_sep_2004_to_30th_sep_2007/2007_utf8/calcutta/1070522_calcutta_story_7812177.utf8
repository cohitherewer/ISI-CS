 For the 18-year-old all-India ISC topper from Modern High School, the last weekend brought two moments that she will cherish forever. 

 On Saturday afternoon, when the ISC results were declared, Priyadarshini Banerjee found she had topped the Class XII examination in the state with 98.75 per cent marks. On Sunday evening, she received a surprise call from Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi who congratulated her for her feat. 

 I feel so honoured, a jubilant Priyadarshini told Metro moments after the governors call. 

 It was a general conversation and the governor congratulated me for my performance and enquired about my plans. He wished me luck for my career. It was very encouraging, she added.

 Priyadarshini started receiving congratulatory calls and messages soon after the results for ISC were declared .

 Sweet success 

 Debabrata Sengupta, 

 Calcutta Boys High School, ISC

 98.5 per cent in science 

 Topperspeak: I expected to score 95 to 96 per cent but not as high as this. I went through the detailed syllabus and it was very helpful. Now I am waiting for the IIT entrance test results. If I get through, I want to pursue either electrical or electronic engineering and do my masters. I want to stay in academics and do research.

 Souvik Mukherjee, 

 St James School, ICSE 

 97.8 per cent (with computer studies) 

 Topperspeak: I was expecting around 90 per cent and I was surprised when I saw my marks. Environmental science definitely contributed towards a higher average. I want to take up science as I want to become an engineer.

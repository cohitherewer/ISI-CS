The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Techies fear to tread

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Swank stands erected for traffic constables lie empty. Chaos reigns at crossings minus the mandatory traffic signals. Pavements are encroached on by food vendors. Autorickshaws run amok... 

 Welcome to Salt Lakes Sector V, the showpiece tech township of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees resurgent Bengal.

 A day after Debasish Sau, senior business analyst with Cognizant Technology Solutions, was knocked down and killed by a car ferrying employees of another IT company, Metro made a round of Sector V on Friday, only to be appalled by the road reality.

 We are not demanding the sky. What we are asking for is the basic safety of our workforce while on transit, said an agitated chief executive officer of a BPO.

 Traffic management or the lack of it is becoming a major issue in the IT hub. Autos and cycle-rickshaws pose the biggest threat on the road. They are all over the place and flout all rules. Most autos take people beyond the permissible limit and race against each other, said a techie at Siemens.

 There is not a single pavement in Sector V that is not occupied by food vendors. And the roads are so narrow that one cannot walk on them without being hit by a cycle-rickshaw or an auto. Almost all roads resemble parking lots. The entry to the West Bengal Electronic Complex is so congested that an accident can take place anytime, said an IT firm employee.

 The workforce in the IT industry has increased manifold and the infrastructure needs to be upgraded soon to take the extra load, said Bikram Dasgupta, CEO and MD, Globsyn Technologies.

 The authorities, on their part, promise a new-look Sector V by the middle of the year, with all infrastructure-related problems resolved. 

 We have entrusted a private company to erect traffic signals at all major crossings. The roads, too, are being upgraded, said S.A. Ahmed, chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which looks after Sector Vs civic affairs.

 But the techies are not satisfied. They want the authorities to be futuristic. What will happen three years later, when the workforce and vehicular traffic will almost double? wondered a BPO executive.

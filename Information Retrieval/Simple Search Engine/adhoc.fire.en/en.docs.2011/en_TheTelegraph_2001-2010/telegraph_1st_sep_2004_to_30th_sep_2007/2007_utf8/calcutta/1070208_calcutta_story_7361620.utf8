 The missing husband

 What goes through your mind? How do you make sense of things when your husband goes out for a few minutes to buy bread and never returns? Marie Darrieussecqs (picture right) novel, Naissance des Fantmes (Amar Bhoutik Swami ) details the inner transformations undergone by a deserted wife as her life begins to fall apart. Her prose examines the emotions of anxiety, fear, listlessness, shock, hallucination and despair that affect the mind of the narrator. The phantasmagoric novel is a powerful study of loss and explores the place of the woman in modern society. One of the leading young French writers today, Darrieussecqs literary style recalls, in literary terms, the nihilism of Beckett or Camus. The author is currently visiting India and is now in Calcutta to release Amar Bhoutik Swami, her first Indian language translation in Bengali (translated by Sanghamitra Dalal; edited by Deepa Chakraborty), published by Purple Peacock Books, in association with the French Embassy in India. This evening, Purple Peacock Books, The French Association and French Embassy in India present the internationally acclaimed author at the ceremonial launch of the Bengali translation of her novel. She will be introduced by Dr Chinmoy Guha. This will be followed by a reading from the novel by Dhritiman Chaterji.

 Employees of software giant IBM have tied up with city-based NGOs to train underprivileged students in basic computer skills.

 Our programme aims at providing children from poor backgrounds with basic computer skills that will help them in their lives, said Arindam Bhattacharyya, solutioning lead, integrated GD solutioning team, IBM India.

 The three-month training sessions reach out to underprivileged students between 11 and 21 years of age. The IBM employees volunteer their services as facilitators in the programme.

 Communication in English is a major challenge and we have also introduced a programme to teach English communication skills from the third session this year. It is currently in progress, added Bhattacharyya. 

 The programme had started in May 2006. Currently, classes are held every Saturday for three hours, at which basic computer skills like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Internet use are covered.

 I always wanted to learn computers and this has been an excellent opportunity. It has made my dreams come true, said Manwara Khatun, one of the children taking part in the programme.

 NGOs like Span, Divya Chaya Trust, Pratyush, Child In Need Institute (CINI) and Calcutta Rescue are partnering IBM. 

 The NGOs select and identify the needy students for the programme from the slum areas of Topsia, Tangra, Motijhil and suburban areas like Barasat and Rajarhat.

 We select students who have passed Madhyamik and who are really needy, said Debolina Shah of CINI Asha.

 There are 35 students in each batch, which is divided into two groups depending on age.

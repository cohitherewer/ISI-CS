 A waterbody in Tollygunge has been filled up to make way for a multi-storeyed despite several complaints. An onlooker repeats his charges

 When did it start?

 Two years ago. A waterbody measuring more than a bigha, opposite Navina cinema hall in Tollygunge, under Charu Market police station, in Ward 89 , has been filled up to make way for a multi-storeyed complex developed by Marshall Trexim Pvt Ltd (a sister concern of Merlin Developers) and 13 other companies.

 I have been running a business at 2A Prince Baktiar Shah Road since 1960 and have seen the promoters filling up the pond since end-2004.

 The promoters have amalgamated the plot with the adjoining one, at 24 Prince Anwar Shah Road, to cover up the filling up of the pond. 

 Is it a pond?

 The records of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) clearly mention that a tank measuring about a bigha has existed at the spot.

 The return filed by the registered owner (late Annapurna Roy) in 1977 under section 6(1) to the land and land reforms department also mentions a tank of 1289.72 sq m. 

 Didnt you complain?

 Since 2005, complaints have been lodged with the land and land reforms department, CMC, fisheries department, environment department, Calcutta Police and senior officials of the West Bengal Pollution control Board. 

 Response? 

 The CMC issued a notice in August 2005 to the owner of the premises stating that the pond had been filled up and threatened to prosecute her. A copy of the notice was forwarded to the local police station. Nothing happened after that. The civic body took up the case again following publication of a report in Metro on February 24, 2006, but to no avail.

 After the report, the state pollution control board also heard the case in April last year and appointed A.K. Bhunia, a retired district judge, to look into the matter and submit a report to the board.

 Bhunia passed an order on May 19, 2006, concluding that no tank existed on the premises since 1971. That ruled out the filling up of the pond.

 None of the complainants views have been considered. There was no intimation about the pollution board order to me, a complainant, despite repeated reminders.

 Only a photocopy of the order was handed over in late January this year. The order does not have a memo number. 

 Now what? 

 The filled-up pond area is set for realty action. We have already applied to the pollution control board under Right to Information Act for more details and plan to move the concerned authority for justice.

 We hope the publication of this report will help restore a waterbody. Many of them are quickly vanishing from Calcutta.

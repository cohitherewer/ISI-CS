 Good news for all Mainland China diehards tired of waiting for a table at Gurusaday Road. A brand new outlet of Mainland China will serve up its Oriental delicacies at South City Mall, starting this Puja.

 The 160-cover restaurant on Prince Anwar Shah Road will be the second in the chain that kicked off Calcuttas recipe revolution south of Park Street, and will highlight the groups aggressive expansion roadmap in town.

 The biggest complaint of our south Calcutta patrons has been the unavailability of tables. The South City Mall outlet will hopefully solve this problem, along with offering a fresh menu packed with new-world flavours, Anjan Chatterjee, director, Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd, owners of Mainland China and Oh Calcutta!, tells Metro.

 The company has also signed up the 140-cover Haka at Mani Square on the EM Bypass, for a Puja launch. The restaurant will have an interactive dim-sum bar and a live cooking counter.

 The group is also setting up a quick-bites and light meals format for BBD Bag area. We have just signed a 3,500-sq-ft property in the central business district, which will cater to around 150 guests at a time and should be ready by the end of the year, says Chatterjee.

 Speciality Restaurants will introduce a very contemporary coffee-shop-like food theatre in Sector V, also by the end of the year. Designed to cater to the IT milieu, it will serve open sandwiches, salads and also an eclectic spread of Calcuttas favourite club items.

 The company has tied up with virtually every new retail mall coming up in and around the city. While Silver Arcade on the Bypass will house Calcuttas third Mainland China and its first Sigree, the Batanagar township will boast a platter of Mainland China, Oh Calcutta! and Haka.

 We are also looking at two exclusive formats for Forum II (scheduled to come up at Chandra Garden opposite Science City), says Chatterjee. Two more Oh Calcutta! outlets are being planned in Salt Lake and south-central Calcutta, along with 18-20 Hakas and an equal number of Kix mood bars.

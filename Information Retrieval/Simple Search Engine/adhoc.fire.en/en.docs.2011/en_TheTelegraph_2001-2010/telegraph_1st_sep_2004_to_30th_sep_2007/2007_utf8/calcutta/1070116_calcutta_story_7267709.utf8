The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 How they kept the mercury rising

 From Glenarys to Joeys, Mall to Chowrasta, the one thing that kept a freezing Darjeeling steaming hot last weekend was the shooting of a Bollywood film made in Bengal, reports Pratim D. Gupta

 Swirling up the Hill Cart Road from Siliguri to Darjeeling the Tata Sumo taxi driver insisted it had been a hot winter this time and hoped that the shooting stars from Mumbai would heat things up at the Mall in the second weekend of the New Year.

 What he didnt dwell on was the fact that the temperature flitting between plus-2 and minus-2 degrees on the Centigrade scale was not hot for the plane folk and definitely not for the hottest attraction of the weekend, Sonali Kulkarni. Pranayam is helping to see me through this absolute killer cold, admits the leading lady of Moxie Entertainments first Bollywood venture being directed by adman Arindam Nandy.

 The title may keep changing from Take Five to Paanch Sach to Alag Raaste, but Via Darjeeling (the latest one on the tentative name list), Joy Gangulys second production after The Bong Connection, can sure make Lola run and run five times round. Because besides Sonali, the intriguing what-if-this-had-happened adda anthology has now got an updated cast headed by Kay Kay Menon and Parvin Dabbas and including Prashant Narayanan, Sandhya Mridul, Simone Singh, Rajat Kapoor and Vinay Pathak.

 Before nestling in the flaky fog of Darjeeling, the lead trio of Kay Kay, Sonali and Parvin had done a weeks shooting in Kalimpong but it was in the first flush tea at Glenarys, the Honeybee brandy at Joeys pub and the inconspicuous presence of the Kanchejungha that made the Darjeeling schedule of Via Darjeeling a chilling clincher.

 On the sets

 They may have had eyefuls of Shah Rukh Khan and Sushmita Sen during the Main Hoon Naa shoot but the Darj locals took to Sonali, Kay Kay and Parveen quite easily. As the two men discussed their first shot of the first day of the Darjeeling shoot on Saturday morning in front of the Oxford Books amp; Stationery shop on the Chowrasta, you could hear those hushed whispers from gangs of Nepali girls joining the crowd: Kay Kay Kay Kay And there were cheers galore for Sonalis dash to the bookshop from her make-up car.

 Everyone from the cast to the crew maintained that it was a story they-cant-speak-of and the scenes the three actors shot for were those crucial middle blocks of the jigsaw puzzle which make the mystery that Via Darjeeling is. Husband Kay Kay and wife Sonali, who are on their honeymoon in the hills, are browsing books in the Oxford bookshop the How To Kill A Husband title finds pride of place on the racks when Parvin, who can be anything from an old lover to a helpful friend depending on which version of the story you go with, bumps into them.

 Giving this essentially oral tale of love, betrayal, jealousy, murder and everything in between visual tapestry is Abhik Mukhopadhyay. With director Nandy in tow, the ace cinematographer was making most of the two-camera set-up. Abhik is easily one of the best cameramen we have in our country today and thats because hes very intelligent, chipped in Kay Kay. The two have worked together in the soon-to-be-released cricket movie Shunya.

 Parvin was absolutely ecstatic about the stubble hes grown just for Via Darjeeling. You dont get many opportunities to literally get into the skin of your character these days, he smiled. And here is truly a great story where I can put forward so many different facets of the human mind through my character Bonny in the different versions of the story.

 There were guest faces, too. Fossils frontman Rupam and new Mumbai model Varsha lip-synced the only song of the film, sung by Shaan and Sunidhi Chauhan, at the underground pub in Glenarys aptly called Buzz. And if that wasnt intoxicating, producer Joy himself was seen mixing a drink or two behind the counter. I still havent got my dialogues, the 26-year-old was heard complaining well after the shoot was wrapped up.

 Off the sets

 A crew that drinks together makes a great film together. Thats easily one of the unwritten rules of movie-making and the Via Darjeeling team was sure living up to this motto. Enveloped in woollens, gloved hands tucked into pockets, the core cast and crew spent the evenings at Joeys pub, the only pub in town run by Joey, a gifted guitarist who had taken to the instrument after hearing radio and watching movies!

 Keeping the spirits of the ensemble cast high literally as well as figuratively throughout the biting cold was executive producer Arindam Sil. Dont count me out as an actor altogether as I do have an important role in this film too, he pointed out. But it sure pleases me a lot to be able to support and spearhead quality film-making on a national level from this part of the country.

 While Teachers and Old Monk flowed freely, Sonali sat there sipping cola. I dont drink, she smiled apologetically, waiting for the snarls and sniggers from the men around her. 

 If Rupam had made a guest appearance on the sets of the film, musician-actor-film-maker Anjan Dutt made a guest appearance off it. Dutt, who was there to shoot a travel show, turned up at the pub and even broke into an impromptu jig with Joey.

 Next night he was singing everything from Sunshine on my shoulders to Bela Bose at a dinner party hosted by Darjeeling SP Rajesh Subarno and it was the turn of Sonali to break into a quick waltz move with Arindam Sil. When the party did end well past midnight, there was a thick white layer on the roof of every car. While the actors from Mumbai got all excited, convinced that they had seen their first Darjeeling snow, local veteran Dutt dismissed the phenomenon as frost!

 Besides all the drinking and singing, Dutt managed to pack in a working lunch with Kay Kay at Glenarys. An announcement of a new project from him is very much on the cards.

 But before that happens, the Via Darjeeling team is slated to travel to Calcutta in February for the final shooting schedule. I am so looking forward to shooting in Calcutta where I had shot for my first Italian film Vrindavan Film Studios which eventually got me Fire In My Heart, the film with Omar Sharif, the dusky actress signed off.

 P.S. The cabbie had spotted Kay Kay at the Mall a day after he caught Sarkar on the local cable network. And all he wanted to know was when he could catch Vishnu (Kay Kays character in Sarkar) in action in Via Darjeeling at the local INOX multiplex.

 Now, thats hot!

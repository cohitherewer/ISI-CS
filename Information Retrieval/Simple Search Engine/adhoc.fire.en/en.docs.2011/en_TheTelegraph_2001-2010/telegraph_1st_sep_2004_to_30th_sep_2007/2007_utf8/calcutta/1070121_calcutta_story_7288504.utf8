 He wanted to be an actor, but ended up being a mixologist. The art of whipping up a cocktail fetched him fame, and how! For celebrity bartender Jamie Walker has stirred and shaken it up for parties hosted by the likes of Madonna and David Beckham. 

 The global brand ambassador for Bombay Sapphire gin was in Calcutta on Friday to promote the brand at Roxy, in The Park. GoodLife got up close with the master mixer.

 I wanted to be an actor and took to hanging around with them. I even studied acting for a while. But I loved the way one mixed a drink. I just stumbled into a bar, and there was no looking back, smiles the London-based man.

 Bar basics

 Though he stumbled into the profession without any training, Jamie feels proper education does help to get the basics of bartending right. Bartenders these days are much more knowledgeable. They know their basics, which is why mixing a drink is becoming more refined these days, he says.

 As the brand ambassador for Bombay Sapphire, Jamie tours across the world, sharing his behind-the-bar tricks wherever he goes.

 A bartending academy is also on the cards. Bartending today is a lucrative profession. The salary of bartenders has really gone up in recent years, so a good bartender today earns as much as a chef, he observes.

 Cocktail call

 Jamie believes a good cocktail creates an experience. Unlike a simple drink, a cocktail is specially made for a particular individual. So it takes into account his personality, preference and mood. A good bartender is one who can gauge these things, says the bar veteran. Say, if a young lady walks into my bar and orders a drink that is very strong, I would probably suggest her a cocktail with lighter spirits.

 Food facts

 Like good wine, a good cocktail should complement the food with which it is served. In fact, I am working on a book that has inputs from chefs around the world. The book pairs cocktails with different kinds of foods, reveals Jamie. North American cuisine has a very rich buttery flavour, whereas in Japan the tastes are very subtle. Indian cuisine is again very different. So the cocktail pairing must also be different for each cuisine. 

 The mixologist feels that cocktails taste different in different parts of the world owing to local ingredients. The taste of a Florida orange is very different from an orange in India. So, local ingredients used in mixing a drink give it a distinctive taste.

 Liquor talk

 Vodka, feels Jamie, lends itself beautifully to cocktails because of its neutral flavour. Whisky, on the other hand, is too strong to be married with any other drink.

 Gin often has a very strong flavour because the junipers are boiled. But it is a very good base for cocktails owing to its versatility, explains Jamie. Bombay Sapphire gin doesnt have an overtly strong flavour because it steams the berries and does not boil them.

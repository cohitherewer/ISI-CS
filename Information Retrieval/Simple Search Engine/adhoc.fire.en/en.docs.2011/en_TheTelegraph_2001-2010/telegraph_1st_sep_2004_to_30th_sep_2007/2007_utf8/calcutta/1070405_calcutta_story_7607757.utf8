The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 College poll sparks clash

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Six students were injured in Heramba Chandra College, in Gariahat, on Wednesday, when supporters of the Students Federation of India (SFI) and Chhatra Parishad clashed over the union elections scheduled for Thursday.

 A police force from Lake police station rushed in to take control of the situation. 

 Of the six, two girls were later admitted to a private hospital. The others got stitches. 

 The Chhatra Parishad put up a blockade at Gol Park, demanding immediate arrest of the outsiders who had allegedly attacked the college students and their supporters. 

 The Thursday election is for 28 seats of 38. Wednesday was the last day for campaigning. The supporters clashed and ransacked the classrooms, breaking furniture and glass panes. A few students also threatened the teachers and teaching staff, said Pradip Chattopadhyay, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 According to college teachers, the clash broke out around 12.10 pm, when a group of SFI students took out a procession in support of their candidates contesting in the Thursday elections.

 At the same time, some Chhatra Parishad students also launched a campaign on the campus. This ultimately ended in a clash. The students started pelting stones and a few students were injured, said a senior teacher of the college.

 The agitated students walked up to the first floor and smashed the glass panes of the notice boards and also broke the furniture inside the union room and a few classrooms. A few students even walked into the staff room and accused the teachers of inaction.

 A few students threatened us for not supporting them. This clash has come as a shock to us, a senior teacher in the commerce department rued.

 The SFI supporters alleged that the Chhatra Parishad members had attacked them with rods and pelted stones at them and had tried terrorising the students. 

 Denying the allegations, a senior Chhatra Parishad leader said: The clash was a sheer display of muscle power and strength. Police witnessed it, too, but refused to act. 

 Acting principal Mukut Ghosal said he had ensured that an adequate police force will be deployed for the Thursday election. 

 He also said that action will be taken against the students involved in Wednesdays clash after the trustee board meeting next Monday.

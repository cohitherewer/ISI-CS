 Murtaza Kapadia is better and a CT scan on Saturday will confirm his recovery from the injuries he suffered last Saturday, when a glass sheet from Exide building came crashing down and landed barely a few inches from him. 

 He has not complained of severe headache today So, we hope he is on his way to recovery. We will take him for another round of CT scan tomorrow, said Mazhar Kapadia, father of the 10-year-old. 

 The Exide authorities, on the other hand, are taking a fresh look at the exterior of the building on the AJC Bose Road-Jawaharlal Nehru Road crossing to avert any repeat of Saturdays incident. 

 We have asked our architects to inquire and ascertain the reasons behind Saturdays accident. We are taking a number of steps, said a company spokesperson. 

 The firm has also offered help to the Kapadia family. 

 Compensation is not my motive. I want them to take steps so that what happened to my son does not happen to anyone else, said Kapadia, who has asked the company to give him in writing the steps taken. 

 Murtaza received 12 stitches in his legs and three on his head after glass shards caused multiple cuts and he fell down losing consciousness. 

 He is still on painkillers and antibiotics and doctors have advised complete bed rest for the Class IV student of La Martiniere for Boys.

 He felt better on Friday as some of his friends also visited him and gave him Get Well Soon cards.

 We are praying for an all clear CT scan report, signed off Kapadia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Madhuri Dixit

 You are disciplined and a very strong decision-maker. You are inclined towards spirituality. You appreciate family ties and cultural heritage. You dream of an ideal partner, but place high value on lovers who can take care of you and your needs. You have a stately, serious bearing, which some may see as cold and haughty.

 Kusum Bhandari

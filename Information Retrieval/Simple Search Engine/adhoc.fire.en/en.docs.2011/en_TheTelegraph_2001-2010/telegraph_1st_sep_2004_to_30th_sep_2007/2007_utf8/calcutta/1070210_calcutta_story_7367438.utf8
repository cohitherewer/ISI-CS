 Healthcare for the poor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Matri Bhavan has launched a project to spread health awareness among the poor and identify those who really cannot afford healthcare.

 Under the Comprehensive Community Healthcare Programme, our teams will organise camps in slums to raise the level of health consciousness, said Pravrajika Bhaktiprana, secretary, Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Matri Bhavan.

 There are six big slums around the Missions charitable maternity hospital at 7A Sree Mohan Lane, in south Calcutta. The hospital has 100 beds and state-of-the-art facilities for mothers and children. The primary objective of the programme is to check the prevalence of low weight of newborns and improve the overall health condition of mothers and children, said a spokesperson for Matri Bhavan.

 One problem of serving the poor is to identify those who really cannot afford proper healthcare. Our camps in the slums will do that, along with spreading health awareness, the spokesperson said. The annual cost has been estimated at Rs 13 lakh, she added.

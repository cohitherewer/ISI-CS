The last La Martiniere Marathon was held way back in 1974. This year, La Martiniere for Boys decided to revive this age-old tradition and organised the run on February 4.

 At the break of dawn, hundreds of students from Classes V to XI reported for the marathon at the Sangam Hall entrance of Fort William. The juniors wore red jerseys for their course of 2 km, those in higher classes wore green jerseys for the distance of 4 km, while the seniormost boys sported yellow jerseys for a course of 7 km.

 We at La Martiniere are committed to turning out healthy, active and well-groomed young men, and the marathon is part of our endeavour towards this goal, said one of the school officials. The teachers of the school took their positions at various checkpoints throughout the route of the marathon, distributing coloured tokens to the boys as they passed by. 

 At the end of the course, the participants were handed numbered tokens, which represented the points they had earned for their respective houses. The points were calculated by deducting their position from the total number of participants in their category. Refreshments were then provided to the tired but happy boys, who had managed to make the marathon a resounding success.

 Career focus

On February 10, the Calcutta chapter of AIESEC, an international forum for youngsters, organised YUVA, a workshop on competency building and communication skills, in association with The Telegraph. Inaugurated by footballer Bhaichung Bhutia and industrialist Sanjay Budhia, it included lecture presentations about the different ways to prepare for an interview and about the importance of developing communication skills at a professional level.

 With the participant count touching 300, the programme met with good response from the youngsters (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). Said Sayantani Bagchi, who studies advertising sales promotion and sales management at Gokhale Memorial Girls College: Todays session helped me a great deal. I was worried about the interview when I would go looking for jobs, but I picked up useful tips here. I have realised the importance of cultivating patience, and of giving time to other peoples opinions as well. Sayantani is now considering becoming a member of AIESEC.

 Umesh Bhutoria, outgoing president of AIESEC, Calcutta chapter, and a student of physics at Scottish Church College, said: These workshops are meant to help students realise there is more to a career than merely following the academic curriculum. It is complementary to it, rather than an alternative. At a personal level, these sessions have made me more aware of the current trends in the professional world.

Thirty students of JU department of mass communication, under the supervision of lecturer Santwan Chottopadhyay, have started a survey on reading and media habits amongst youngsters visiting the 32nd Kolkata Book Fair. Funded by the university, it is the first time that such a study has been undertaken by the students. The respondents are school, college and university students within the age group of 18 to 25 years. The study also touches upon their interest in little magazines and the shifting of the fair venue. The surveyors plan to publish the survey report later in a book.

 Reunion revelry

 The St Xaviers College (Cal) Alumni Association invites all Xaverians to be a part of their annual reunion Samagam 2007, to be organised in association with The Telegraph, at the college on the evening of February 24. A feast of Punjabi delicacies will be laid out, while DJs Ravi and Harish Lakhmani rock the crowd with Punjabi remixes.

 What rsquo;s on your mind this week

 Farce course

 Environmental consciousness has suddenly flooded educational institutions in Bengal. Environmental science is now a mandatory subject in the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary syllabi and at the graduate level. At the Masters level, it is a specialised subject. While the introduction of the subject is a positive development, it also has many flip sides. Many inexperienced teachers of schools and colleges, who otherwise have nothing to do with the subject, have started writing books on it and releasing them in the market. 

 Surprisingly, the teachers who have specialised in environmental sciences have no space in this burgeoning race of authors! As a student of environmental science, I have a question for policy makers in the education ministry. When a philosophy or English teacher can pen a book on environmental science, I too must have the right to write a book on philosophy?

 The story is the same in classrooms too. To reduce costs, schools are getting history and geography teachers to teach environmental science. The excuse is that there is no reason for appointing a new teacher for a 50-mark paper.

 If the trend persists, what will happen to students like us? Every year about 85 students pass out from universities in West Bengal with degrees in environmental science. But even after completing a Masters programme, they remain unemployed.

 A student from IISWBM recently told me: ldquo;I had high hopes when I took admission in the environment management course. But even after passing out with more than 75 per cent marks, I have no clue what I should do for a career. rdquo; 

 Another student from Calcutta University accused the corruption within the system for the crisis. He said: ldquo;There is no place for a student of environmental science in any arena, whether the pollution control board, the civic bodies, the state environment department or the private sector. Even when a post is vacant, it is filled up by either an engineer or a graduate from a different discipline. rdquo;

 The NGOs are also out to exploit the students by paying them meagre salaries. There are no posts under the public service commission examinations that require students of environment science.

 Recently, I asked an M.Sc first-year student of environmental science at Viswa Bharati University about her career plans. She said her teachers have assured her a bright future five years down the line. Well, that rsquo;s exactly what we were told when we were doing our postgraduation in the subject five years ago. The truth is that the situation has not changed at all. 

 My question to all our teachers is, ldquo;When will this five-year planning materialise? When you are not sure about the future of students studying this subject, why do you offer them unrealistic dreams? rdquo;

 The government must understand that it is not enough to introduce new courses in schools and colleges. Employment opportunities must also be created for students who put in their time and energy to pursue the courses.

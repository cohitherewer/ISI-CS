The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 B-schools eye pact

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Icfai Business School (IBS) played host to the deans of two American business schools under Central Michigan University (CMU) and North Carolina Central University (NCCU) on its Sector V campus last week.

 The interaction will start a process to promote co-operation between the institutions, said Santanu Ray, the director of IBS, Calcutta.

 A tie-up with a premier institution like IBS would facilitate the College of Business Administration of CMU, said Monica Holmes, the director of the MBA and MSIS programmes and associate dean of the CMU B-school.

 IBS Calcutta and CMU are planning to introduce exchange programmes for teachers and students to promote advanced studies and research.

 The institutions have also planned to jointly introduce graduate and undergraduate programmes, transfer of academic courses and organise symposiums, conferences and meetings.

 Ray and Robert Chapman, the assistant dean of the School of Business of NCCU, spoke about collaboration in the areas of research programmes and papers, publication of co-authored articles in international referred journals and faculty exchange programmes.

 Comparisons between the US and Indian markets with respect to aspects of consumer behaviour would be the focus of the programmes.

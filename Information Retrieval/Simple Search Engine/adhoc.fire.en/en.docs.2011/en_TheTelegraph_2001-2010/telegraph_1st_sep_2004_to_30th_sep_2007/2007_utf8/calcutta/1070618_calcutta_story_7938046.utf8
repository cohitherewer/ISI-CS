 Another all-male bastion crumbles

 Women of the citys Anglo-Indian community participated on Sunday in the election of Calcutta Rangers Club, a mens-only domain for over a century. Women also fought for two berths in the clubs executive committee.

 The male bastion, founded in 1896, was breached in April when the club amended its statute and decided to induct women as general members.

 Im overjoyed, even though the club has taken considerable time to realise that women should enjoy equal status as men, said Gillian Rosemary Hart, principal, Welland Gouldsmith School, and a former MLA representing the Anglo-Indian community.

 Hart has been associated with the club for more than 30 years, but only as a members wife, till the amendment took effect. On Sunday, she was an executive committee member, all by herself.

 This is a memorable day in our clubs history, said club president Peter Remedios. Our newly-inducted women members have participated in the polls and two women have been elected to the 10-member executive committee. Remedios felt the club had taken the right decision in changing its mens-only character. 

 The change is more encouraging at a time when a woman is in the race for the post of the countrys President, said Hart. 

 Only Anglo-Indians are eligible for general membership of the club. Others can apply for associate or corporate membership.

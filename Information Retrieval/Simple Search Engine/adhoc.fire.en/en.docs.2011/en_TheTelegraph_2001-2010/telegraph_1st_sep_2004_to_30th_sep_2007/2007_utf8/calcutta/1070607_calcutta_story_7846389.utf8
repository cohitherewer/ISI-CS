 Marriage tide turns in favour of techies

 - Fat pay packet swings parental preference for sunshine sector employees

 Groom wanted for a 26-year-old Convent-ed girl Boys from the IT sector will be given first preference.

 Exit: Government employees, bankers and businessmen.

 Enter: IT professionals to keep favourites MBAs and engineers company.

 The new-age sector is making quite an impact in the marriage market, with techies inching up the most-wanted list. Matchmakers are flooded with requests from girls parents for a suitable boy from information technology and information technology-enabled services sectors.

 IT professionals are attracting a lot of marriage proposals. Many parents now want a techie son-in-law, says Sanjay Duggar of Khushi Matrimony, in Salt Lake. Traditionally, when it came to marriage, Bengalis opted for safe options bank or government employees while non-Bengalis preferred boys from business families. Not any more.

 The tide is now turning towards the techies, with profiles of sunshine-sector employees recording the maximum hits on matrimonial sites. 

 A few months ago, I had put up my profile on one of the leading matrimonial sites. The profile carried the name of the IT company I was working for at that time. I received a fabulous response. My inbox was flooded with mails from interested parents, says 28-year-old Arpan Ghosh.

 The fat pay packet is the primary reason for the shift in parental preferences. Youngsters in the IT sector start earning much more much faster. Their peer group in other professions has to slog it out till the mid-30s or late-30s before being able to afford the good life.... There is also a sense of stability in the IT sector, says Kavita Malhotra, mother of a 27-year-old girl.

 The other plus is the prospect of IT professionals going abroad. People have really become conscious of the profession of the prospective groom. Where he works, how much he earns and what his growth prospects are matter a lot. And there is the lure of foreign shores for sure, said Vibhash Mehta, business head, Shaadi.Com.

 Rain showers pain on citizens 

Patient dies without treatment

 A 45-year-old woman who had suffered a heart attack had to walk a kilometre from her home to Medical College Hospital on Wednesday morning, as the flooded streets were out of bounds for vehicles.

 And in the hospital, she was made to shuttle from one department to another without treatment for three hours, till she dropped dead.

 The hospital did not treat her at all. She died gasping in front of several doctors, said the womans husband, a state government employee. 

 As news of the death spread, neighbours stormed the emergency ward and beat up an intern. Around 165 interns struck work in protest.

 Gita Rani Payra, of Surya Sen Street, felt a severe pain in the chest early on Wednesday. A local doctor diagnosed a heart attack and advised immediate hospitalisation.

 She needed to be admitted to an ICCU and put on oxygen immediately. Walking was the last thing I would suggest to such a patient, said the doctor, Chandi Charan Pan.

 But not a single taxi could be spotted in the marooned neighbourhood at that hour. I had no option but to make her walk to Medical College, a kilometre from our home. For the same reason, she could not be taken to a private hospital in Salt Lake, where one of our sons works, recalled Gita Ranis husband Jatindranath.

 But after the couple reached Medical College at 8am, the second phase of their ordeal started. The doctor in the emergency ward said the pain was not serious and sent her to the OPD, from where she was sent back to the emergency.

 She was not put on oxygen and despite the pain, had to travel from one department to another on foot. Panting for breath all the while, she finally collapsed at 11am and died, said the husband. He later lodged a complaint with the hospital authorities.

 How could we administer oxygen to her? There were only two cylinders. The emergency ward lacks the most basic facilities, said an intern.

 We have lodged a police complaint against the assault, said A.N. Biswas, the deputy superintendent of the hospital. The police had to be called in to tackle the situation.

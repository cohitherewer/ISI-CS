 One-act winners

 It was time for fun, entertainment, brainstorming and a search for the best at a series of inter-school competitions organised by South Point High School at Madhusudan Mancha. 

 The school organised Perceptum the essay competition, Q-Point the quiz competition, Satrangi the singing competition and Masquerade the one-act play competition, in April. More than 150 students from renowned city school participated in the programme. 

 Seventeen schools participated in Q-Point and quiz master Charanpreet Singh had a tough time judging the best. Eight schools made it to the final round. South Point bagged the first prize followed by La Martiniere for Boys and St Augustines School. 

 The brainstorming was followed by the musical challenge, Satrangi, hosted by singer Paroma Banerjee. This time Tista Dutta of Gokhale Memorial Girls High School was the winner. 

 But the best part of the day-long programme was the one-act play competition called Masquerade. There were eight schools which were ready with the their best scripts and actors. 

 The plays were innovative and the subjects varied. Gosh! We missed the train, staged by Apeejay School (picture

 It was followed by MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary Schools Valentines Wish. 

 While Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan bagged the first prize for their play Mission to Moon the host school became the second runner-up for their play The Other Side, which was about handling examination pressure and post-examination social activities. The winners were given cash prizes worth Rs 12,000, Rs 8,000 and Rs 5,000 respectively.

Tunes from the past

 In the age of remixes and western songs, Nehru Children Museum organised a workshop where children between the age seven and 18 years brushed up their knowledge of old Bengali tunes. 

 The three-day workshop that started on May 29, was conducted by singer Nupurchhanda Ghosh. It dealt with songs of Atul Prosad, Rajanikanto and Dwijendralal. About 20 children participated in the programme.

 The workshop was aimed to create a desire among the present generation for old tunes that are on their way to extinction, said Ghosh. 

 Though most of the participants did not know about the songs, they were enthusiastic about the workshop. Utsha Das, a Class X student of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, said: I am rediscovering the music here that I missed out for all these years because of my studies. 

 Subhajyoti Dutta of Mitra Institution said: I will practise the songs everyday that I have learnt at the workshop. 

 Sikha Mukherjee, administrative secretary of the museum, said, if the children and parents agree then the museum can also start a full-time course.

 Waste management

 Tiljala Shed, an NGO, organised a seminar on May 29 at Charukala Bhavan. The topic was Corporate recyclable waste a source for changing lives of ragpickers.

 The seminar highlighted the miseries and plight of ragpickers. To make things easier for them, the NGO under the guidance of Chandana Ghosh Dastidar of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), has set up godowns in places like Topsia, Tiljala and Park Circus. The local ragpickers can dump their collection there and get the price they deserve. 

 I think it will be a good idea to recycle the wastes in Dhapa and the CMC should take the initiative. If things go right the process might start from the end of this year, said Ghosh Dastidar.

 SHOUT

 OUT LOUD 

 What rsquo;s

 on your mind this week

 Batting

 for Dada

 Sourav

 Ganguly has made a stupendous comeback

 to international cricket. But about

 six months ago, the general feeling

 was that the Indian cricket board

 had shown him the door for good.

 He had been kept out of the Indian

 squad for a couple of tours. Former

 chairman of the selection committee

 Kiran More was making statements

 to the effect that Sourav didn rsquo;t

 stand a chance of making a comeback.

 At

 this stage, when the odds were

 piled heavily against our former

 captain, I had pleaded with my

 spiritual

 guru to pray for Sourav rsquo;s

 cause. After much cajoling, he had

 promised me that Sourav would get

 justice. I know it seems outrageous,

 but I believe that my guru rsquo;s

 powers played a role in Sourav rsquo;s

 recall to the Indian side, apart

 from, of course, the southpaw rsquo;s

 own determination and ability.

 My

 guru preaches a humanitarian brand

 of spiritualism. He implores us

 to be compassionate and his discourse

 has a calming effect. It develops

 focus, devotion and confidence

 in oneself. All he asks you is to

 be a human being with kindness

 as the defining quality.

 Chaos

 on road

 Calcuttans

 tend to blame the driver as a 

 rule 

 whenever there is a road mishap.

 It is, however, not fair to jump

 to such a conclusion. In this 

 city, 

 commuters are always in a rush,

 with scant regard for traffic 

 signals, 

 safety rules and pedestrian crossings.

 Most

 roads in the city do not have

 pavements

 and the few that are present

 are

 sparingly used. People cross

 roads

 wherever they want to, whenever

 they want to. So, is it fair

 to

 always blame the driver when

 there rsquo;s

 a mishap?

 To

 ensure the smooth flow of traffic,

 a few immediate measures have to

 be taken. Pavements should be constructed

 on all the streets and traffic

 rules strictly imposed. The policemen

 too need to put up a smarter show,

 especially during rush hours.

 Taking

 a leaf out of countries like

 China,

 a separate lane should be constructed

 for bicycles and motorbikes.

 Another

 need of the hour is more traffic

 posts and better coordination

 between

 them. And pedestrians should

 be

 made to cross the roads only

 at

 zebra crossings.

 One-way

 and two-way traffic also needs

 to be properly planned. Acute

 traffic

 congestion is observed when some

 of the schools give over. School

 buses should be parked inside

 schools

 wherever there is space. Students

 also need to be alert when crossing

 roads.

 Constructing

 new flyovers at huge costs is

 fine

 but the government should not

 sanction

 money to install surveillance

 cameras

 to monitor the roads.

 Also,

 it is rather foolish to construct

 overbridges and expect people,

 especially old people, to climb

 up 60 steps and down another

 60

 to cross a road. Most overbridges

 in the city lie unused. Escalators

 and elevators would help. If

 this

 isn rsquo;t

 feasible, CMC could consider building

 more subways.

 Driving

 licenses should be issued only

 after stringent tests. Too many

 people take the driving test for

 granted. For youngsters, it is ldquo;cool rdquo; to

 drive at a high speed with booming

 music dwarfing other sounds. And

 policemen turn a blind eye to

 it.

 Look

 at the number of immigrant taxi

 drivers in the city. Who knows

 how many of them even have a valid

 licence or how they procured it?

 In today rsquo;s

 world, of course, money can even

 buy the law.

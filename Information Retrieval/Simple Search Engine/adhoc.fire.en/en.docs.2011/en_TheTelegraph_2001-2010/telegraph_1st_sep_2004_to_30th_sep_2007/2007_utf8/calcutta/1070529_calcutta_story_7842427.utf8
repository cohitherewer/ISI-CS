 A month-old baby with an infection in her left eye was allegedly left unattended to for several hours after she was admitted to the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology (RIO) on Monday. The institute is located inside Medical College and Hospital.

 Anamika Bhuiya was bleeding from the bloated eye when she arrived at the hospital with her parents from home in Ghatal, West Midnapore. Partho Bandyopadhyay, a local doctor, accompanied the parents to the hospital. 

 She needed immediate attention, but there was considerable delay in getting her a bed, alleged Bandyopadhyay. A bed was made available after a day-long wait.

 The childs mother, Saraswati, said: The doctors didnt operate on my daughter and now, she can lose her sight.

 Doctors at the institute, however, denied the charges.

 Since the baby is being breast-fed, its risky to put her under anaesthesia or operate on her immediately after admission, said Chandan Barik, resident medical officer at the institute. The infection has to be treated first. Only then the surgery can be carried out, he added.

 The doctors, however, fear the chances of saving the childs eye are slim. The cornea in the left eye has been ruptured and the eyeball, too, is affected. There is only 10 per cent chance of saving the eye, said Gautam Bhaduri, director, RIO.

 Anamika had injured her eye a week ago. Her parents rushed her to a local health centre. But the infection spread across the eye, prompting the parents to consult Bandyopadhyay, who advised them to shift the child to the Calcutta hospital.

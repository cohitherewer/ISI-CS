 The state government iterated its stand against a dress code for schoolteachers on Monday. 

 Expressing concern over last weeks incident at Bakhrahat Girls High School, on the southern fringes, where eight teachers were held hostage for wearing salwar-kameez, school education minister Partha De said a drive would be undertaken to persuade schools not to impose a dress code on teachers. 

 The governments stand is very clear. We feel that teachers should come to school decently dressed. The schools cannot force teachers to abide by a dress code. It appears that many schools are not aware of this stand. Measures will be taken to make them aware, said De.

 He met senior officials of his department and the authorities of the Bakhrahat school in Bishnupur on Monday. The minister asked the school authorities to ensure that classes are held normally. He also expressed hope that the eight teachers would immediately resume work.

 The teachers had decided not to take classes till the situation returned to normal in the school.

 The government has made it clear to us that there should not be any dress code for teachers, said Anup Ghosh, the secretary of the school. Considering the governments view, we do not want to go into a debate on the issue. We are not going to tell the teachers what to wear. We will only urge them to dress decently.

 A large number of guardians, students and local residents had locked the teachers in a room on the campus, alleging that one of them had slapped a student when she protested against her wearing a salwar-kameez. 

 Sources in the school said the teachers had urged the managing committee to allow them to wear salwar-kameez. But the committee had turned down the plea, saying that local residents felt they should wear only saris to school.

 Where love is the muse

 A state of being that rejuvenates memories, evokes feelings of warmth, affection and intimacy and opens up a world of expectations for the future, togetherness is a word that offers gentle intimations of the contentment of the inner spirit. Bearing testimony to their eternal companionship, Togetherness, the ongoing exposition of works by artist couples, is also a perfect celebration of their mutual love and understanding. Life and love have become synonymous with creative urge in the works on show, colours and lines in joyous unison expressing the true spirit of sharing, caring and being together. Participating artists include Asit Poddar and Sukla Poddar, Amal Ghosh and Iris Hudson Ghosh, Haren Thakur and Sharmila Thakur (a painting by her appears right), Pulak Ghosh and Tandra Chandra and Suvaprasanna and Shipra Bhattacharya.

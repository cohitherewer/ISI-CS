 Nod wait ends for schools

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Private English-medium schools awaiting the state governments no-objection certificate (NOC) for getting affiliation from any board or council will have to wait for another two months.

 The applications of 45 schools are pending with the education department. The backlog started since mid-2006, when the government decided not to issue any more NOCs till a set of fixed rules for granting affiliation was prepared. The rules are likely to be incorporated into the West Bengal Control of School Expenditure Act.

 We hope to prepare the rules in another two months. The pending NOCs will be issued as soon as the rules are finalised, said Santosh Mahapatra, an official in the state school education department.

 Since Independence, the government had been issuing the NOCs based on certain guidelines set out in government orders. Over the past few years, said an official, several schools had violated the orders while seeking the NOC. Some had even moved court against the orders.

 The fixed rules, as part of a piece of legislation, will help us follow a uniform policy in issuing the certificate. Also, schools will find it more difficult to bend those rules or challenge them in court, the official explained.

 The authorities of several upcoming schools have expressed relief over the governments decision to lift the ban on issuing the NOC. The government has also decided to lift the curb imposed last year on issuing NOCs for opening English-medium schools in Calcutta and its adjoining districts.

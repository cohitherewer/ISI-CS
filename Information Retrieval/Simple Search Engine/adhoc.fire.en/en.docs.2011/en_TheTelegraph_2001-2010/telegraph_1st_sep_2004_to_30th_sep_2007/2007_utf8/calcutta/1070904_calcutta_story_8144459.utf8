The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Eye on the skyline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcuttas inherent vibrancy is remarkably on display in its outdoor life and no other city uses its public spaces more ingeniously, feels Ravi Kalia, a professor of architectural history and urban studies in South Asia at The City College of New York.

 Calcutta is more textured than any other Indian city, and richer for the clutch of European influences which have shaped its skyline, Kalia, who was recently in town for a talk on Urban Architecture in Calcutta, told Metro.

 A Ph.D in urban architecture history from the University of California at Los Angeles, his writings include three books on Indias post-Independence state capitals.

 Chandigarh: The Making of an Indian City, Bhubaneswar: From a Temple Town to a Capital City and Gandhinagar: Building National Identity in Postcolonial India all deal with modernist architecture. In this pursuit, since Im looking at the whole of India now, I cant ignore Calcutta, the professor pointed out.

 Kalia felt, like in most organically growing cities where the cityscape has often been overrun by greedy real estate development, money has overpowered imagination in Calcutta. 

 Clearly, there has been little effort to educate people here on aesthetics or utility of architecture. But then, there are the basic bread-n-butter issues to be addressed before that, he lamented.

 Kalia stressed the need to increase literacy and encourage community participation in urban planning.

 Its crucial to work on the basics and we cant afford to take our eyes off the poor. So, any planning which ignores those who build and the conditions in which they build, is unacceptable. Its equally important to create adequate stocks of affordable rental housing to cater to the emerging service sectors, he suggested.

 In his discourse organised by the American Center, the academician focused on three core issues experiments in modernism and its impact nationally, preservation of heritage structures and traditional crafts and our peculiar penchant for becoming a global city.

 Kalia hoped Calcutta doesnt lose its core identity in its search for a new skyline. Planning for the middle-class is the key.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Black sheep in uniform

 - List of bad cops being drawn up but slack action taken

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Calcutta Police has as many as 71 black sheep in the non-IPS ranks, according to a list being prepared by the force over the past year.

 But departmental action has been taken only against a handful, thanks to delay in investigation.

 A senior officer attributed the delay which is defeating the purpose of drawing up the list to the lack of a dedicated department to probe the charges against the policemen, some of them accused of offences as serious as murder and rape.

 In the present system, if a charge is brought against a non-IPS policeman, the investigation is carried out by the divisional deputy commissioner concerned.

 Action is taken only after the probe report is submitted, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) P.K. Chatterjee.

 An officer at the Lalbazar headquarters said the over-burdened deputy commissioner rarely completes a probe against an accused cop in time.

 A total of 36 cases have been registered against policemen over the past year, an officer at the Lalbazar headquarters told Metro. Among them are 10 cases of extortion and six of murder or attempt to murder and three cases of rape or molestation, he added.

 Several complaints, he added, have been registered against sergeants and sub-inspectors, too, this year.

 In April, 2003, three policemen were found involved in a heroin racket in Barasat, North 24-Parganas. One of them, a Calcutta Police constable, is still absconding.

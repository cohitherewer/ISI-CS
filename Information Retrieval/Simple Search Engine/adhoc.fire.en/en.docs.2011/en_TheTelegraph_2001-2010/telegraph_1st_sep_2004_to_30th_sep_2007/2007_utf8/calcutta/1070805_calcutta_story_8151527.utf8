 Campus brands

 Corporates are making a beeline for schools to promote their products. And not being denied admission at all 

 Corporates are making a beeline for schools to promote their products. And not being denied admission at all 

 A city retailer supplies Reebok shoes to four Calcutta schools, Birla High School for Boys, Delhi Public School (DPS), The Heritage School and South Point. The schools either put up a notice informing the parents of the shops location or we set up camps in schools, says Vijay Dugar, partner, CS Trade Link, which retails Reebok and Levis products. The Rs 1,290 variety of Reebok comes for Rs 700 and the Rs 990 variety for Rs 600. They have done away with the concept of two pairs of shoes one for regular wear and one for PT classes, he adds. 

 Whether getting to wear a Reebok at a subsidised rate as part of the school uniform is a good thing or not is debatable. But one thing is clear the days of Maggi quiz being the highlight of the school calendar are gone. With corporates fighting it out to catch the childs attention, the school campus has become a playground for the biggest brands. Linc, Scholastic, Nestle, Horlicks, Reebok, Camlin, Bournvita and a host of coaching centres are making a beeline for schools to promote their products. And not being denied admission at all.

 The promotions range from feminine hygiene programmes conducted by Whisper, the sanitary towels brand, to painting contests by Camlin to spelling competitions by Linc. Our Lady Queen of the Missions School played host to several brands recently. Whisper showed a documentary on the female reproductive system and handed over free packets of sanitary napkins. Malhotra Book Depot spoke about their system of online tutoring for medical and engineering entrance tests. Students got free Sunfeast pasta packets. The television channel ESPN also visited the campus, which boasts of a vending machine dispensing Boost and Horlicks drinks. They come at Rs 6 per cup. The machine was set up last week. 

 At Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, Camlin conducted a drawing competition and AMRI Hospitals and Dabur held health check-ups. We allowed AMRI to carry out check-ups because it was a good thing, says principal Malini Bhagat. Chai-Eng Dutta, a teacher of Calcutta International School, says that Sunfeast conducted a poster competition on the campus. Samsung products were displayed during a carnival at the school. An FM radio channel went there to RJ-hunt. 

 South Point introduced the Reebok shoes last year, making plain white socks with Canyon Black brand of Reebok shoes part of the uniform from Transition (kindergarten). Many schools have Caf Coffee Day (CCD) kiosks. A student of a reputed central Calcutta school wants to join another high-end school, because the latter has a CCD kiosk. 

 The younger the student, the better it is for the brands. We get more offers for the primary section, as students in those classes are at a very impressionable age, says Mukta Nain, the principal of Birla High School for Boys. Teachers are targets too. There was a bone mass density measurement test conducted by Apollo Gleaneagles. It was quite beneficial for us, says Uma Doss, a primary school teacher in Laxmipat Singhania Academy. 

 Cut-off mark 

 Schools insist that brands are allowed into the campus after a thorough screening. But what is the cut-off mark? 

 We receive countless offers from companies. Disney, ESPN, Sunfeast, Horlicks, Dabur the list is endless. But we dont let everyone in. We see if its a reputed brand or if their programme is child-friendly, says Bhagat. Devi Kar, principal, Modern High Girls School, says: We have to use our discretion. It has to be educational in nature. 

 Sister Smita, principal, Our Lady Queen of the Missions School, says: If its a career counselling programme I allow it for the plus-two students. We see which programmes other schools have accepted. South Point says that it rejects programmes that have too much commercial content. But where does one draw the line? If there are monetary transactions involved we do not entertain the companies, says Krishna Damani, South Point spokesperson. We made it very clear that participation was optional in a competition where the children had to buy a box of crayons. We reject programmes which have a strong buy this message, says Bhagat.

 Some schools see nothing wrong with the good brands. Nain says making Reebok shoes a part of the uniform works well. As the children dont need to buy two pairs of shoes, it works out to the same thing. Besides they are getting the shoes at a great discount. On other events like quizzes, she says: They organise it meticulously, get an experienced quiz master and give good prizes. Corporates and schools are working hand-in-hand. Though there may be a couple of questions on the products in a quiz contest, the rest of the competition comprises regular posers.

 Brand promotions, adds psychologist Mohormala Chatterjee, have another good side. The campaigns can make the child aware. Kids have begun to realise that it is an advertisement campaign and they are pushing the product. As if on cue, Sukanya Mitra, a Class V student, says that she knows that Atta Maggi is healthy but expensive. That is why I dont ask my mother to buy it every day. Though she does buy it whenever I ask. 

 The kids seem hooked. Says Shubhanga Banerjee, a Class IX student from South Point: Reebok is a reputed brand and the shoes are quite comfortable. I think its a good deal for Rs 600. 

 Side effects

 Promotion in schools makes sound business sense for the brands . Dugar, the Reebok retailer, says: The idea is to make the students start wearing Reebok from an early age, so that they stick with the brand when they grow up. Says Arjun Mukherjee, creative director of Bates EnterpriseDavid: The child is the focus now. With the rise in nuclear families and both parents working, parents give in to the childs demands. 

 But that seems to be the problem with some. There are parents who feel that brands may not be such a good thing to grow up with. If a school supports their promotion, it is almost like legitimising consumerism and initiating children early into it. As with South Point, Birla High has students in Reebok from kindergarten. Will this not make Reebok a lifelong habit? 

 The schools protest strongly. It is not about building brand loyalists. The shoes are comfortable and one pair doubles up for formal wear and sports wear. Besides, there is a discount. Though the parents were apprehensive initially, now they are quite okay with the idea, says Damani. DPS, Ruby Park, says that such a scheme is related to consumerism to some extent, but exposure is also necessary. The students have been asked to wear Reebok shoes because they are good for health, the school says. Meenakshi Atal, vice-principal, Heritage, says that the school tried out Khadims and Bata, but Reebok proved the most comfortable. School shoes have to have the right foot arch, she adds. 

 Fun and free tips

 Not everyone is convinced. The child-centric scheme of things not only promotes brands, but also self-centredness, says Dipankar Basu, who teaches at St Xaviers Collegiate School. The school does not allow brand campaigns, he says. Children are made to feel as if the universe revolves around them. Chatterjee adds that despite children getting exposure through such promotions, they are also easily influenced. 

 Basu says that the business becomes blatant sometimes. Three years ago, a private college from Australia invited some of his colleagues to lunch at Hotel Hindustan International, where they were told that for every 15 students who applied to the college, the teacher who had recommended them would get an all-expenses paid trip to the university as visiting faculty. A sightseeing trip would also be included. Basu adds that no one accepted the offer. 

 A teacher of a reputed school says that the one time the school allowed a presentation, it turned out to be a bitter experience. An ex-student said he would conduct a workshop on using the library and encyclopaedias. The person focused only on selling a brand of encyclopaedia. In the guise of giving out certificates, he got the childrens addresses and phone numbers. Parents complained that there were constant calls asking them to buy the encyclopaedias, he says. 

 But at the same time, Suvadip Chatterjee, a Class X student at Assembly of God Church School, Park Street, feels school life will be dull without brands. We not only enjoy ourselves but also stand to gain a lot from programmes like quiz contests. It is definitely not a distraction. Agrees Surjo Chakravarty of The Future Foundation School: It is a lot of fun because you get free periods.

 If Indian kids are really as savvy as the Surf Excel boy who dictates Red ko red rakhne ke liye blue, then probably they deserve their brands. Maybe as part of the syllabus too, to be educated early in consumerism as a way of life.

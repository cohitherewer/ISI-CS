 For the third time in Calcutta, a talent hunt audition ended in a fiasco when participants were chased away by police from the gate of the venue on Elgin Road.

 The audition for Bathroom Singer, a contest for untrained voices on Saharas TV channel Filmy was being held without permission from police. The chaos was a rerun of the auditions for Sonys Fame Gurukul in 2005 and Zee TVs Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2007 this February.

 The show was scheduled to be held at The Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society, which also hosted a Part I exam during the day.

 The crowd count last night was 2,000, while the venue could accommodate only 500 people. How can we allow the event to be held? said assistant commissioner A.K. Som Choudhury, on patrol in front of the college.

 We did not expect such a response, said Shailesh Kapoor, the marketing and content head of Filmy, from Mumbai. The show will be held at 9am on Thursday at Lakeland Country Club, on Kona Expressway.

 Police claimed the shows event management company, 360 Degree Experience, was informed on Tuesday evening that the audition could not be held. We could not inspect the arrangements, as they approached us for consent only yesterday, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 He claimed the channel had been asked, through the event management firm, to telecast the message that the show had been cancelled. But the order was not carried out.

 At the venue, as the college authorities shut the doors on the participants, tempers were frayed in the absence of word from the organisers. We have been waiting here since 2am. At 9.30am, the police started lathicharging us, complained Md. Mustaq from Asansol. Till 11.30am, we were issued registration numbers over phone, said Ratikanta Jana from Haldia.

 We have not heard from the organisers, said Mangaldas Shanghavi, the president of the Society. The college, he said, had let out the ground floor and the first floor auditoriums a month ago. It is the organisers responsibility to arrange for legal requirements, he said.

 The exam, he said, would not have come in the way of hosting the show had the number of participants been 400-500.

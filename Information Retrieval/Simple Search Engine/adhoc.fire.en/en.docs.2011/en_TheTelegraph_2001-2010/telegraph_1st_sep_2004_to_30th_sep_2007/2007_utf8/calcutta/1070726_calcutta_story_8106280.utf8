 A 30-year-old private tutor was arrested in Varanasi on Tuesday night for allegedly appearing in the state medical entrance examination as a dummy for Rupa Majumder of Durgapur. She secured a rank of 707 on the merit list. 

 Babli Kazmi had been on the run. She had provided a fake address while buying her mobile phone connection. Detective department officers called up the number, pretending to be employees of a courier company. They said there was a parcel for her that only she could receive. When Babli turned up to collect the parcel, she was arrested.

 Babli is the eldest child of Mujahid Hussain, a Group-D employee of Varanasi Nagar Nigam. She grew up in New Loco Colony with her brothers Imran and Zeeshan.

 She completed Plus II from UP State Girls Inter College in 1995 and started looking for jobs. Three years later, she enrolled for a BA course in Vidyapith University but didnt continue, said Ajoy Kumar, the city detective chief. 

 Police said she had received between Rs 30,000 and Rs 40,000 for appearing in the joint entrance exam for Rupa. 

 For the past few years, Babli had been privately coaching students from Class IX to Class XII. That is how she kept herself updated with the syllabus. It appears that she got involved with the racket through Ranvijay Pathak, who did his schooling in Varanasi, said a senior officer. 

 The investigators have found that Babli flew to Calcutta for the entrance test and was put up in a hotel off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road by Ayan Mukhopadhyay, an associate of Ranvijay and an intern at Medical College and Hospital. She took a train back to Varanasi.

 The police believe that there are others from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar who had appeared as dummy candidates in the state medical entrance test this year. Most of them came in touch with the racket through its agents. One of the agents has been identified as Nirbhay Singh of Lucknow.

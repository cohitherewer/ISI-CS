The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Angelina Jolie

 You are very clear about what you can and cannot expect from relationships. In love, you like to be honest and open-minded. You have an active and inquisitive mind. You try not to let imaginary guidelines and fantasies overshadow reality. You are self-reliant and have a good memory.

 Kusum Bhandari

 A spooky experience

 A moving shadow or an unexplained apparition, an intangible presence whether benign or distressing, witchcraft or voodoo most of us have experienced mysterious, eerie happenings at some point in our lives. From Shakespeare to Saint Saens, Tagore to Dahl, Pink Floyd to Stephen King to the Eagles, spirits, ghosts and phantoms have ruled the creative imagination, giving birth to copious quantities of art, music, literature and films (a scene from the movie Ghost appears right) on the supernatural. Who can forget Shakespeares fearful and lovable ghosts, Tagores evocative ghostly tales, Floyds Brain Damage and Dahls Matilda, to name a few. Recreating the excitement and drama of such metaphysical experiences, Spooks amp; Spirits invites the audience to delve into the realm of the unexplained, while keeping a date with their favourite spooks and spirits. Taking them along this journey of chills and thrills will be Arjun Chakraborty, Alakananda Roy, Barun Chanda, Gopa Ghosh, Punam Singh, Jeffrey Menezes, Natasha Jaques, Barun Das and Sounak Chatterjee. Concept: Oindrilla Dutt and Keya Dutt Paul.

 Event: An evening of poetry, music, readings and reminiscences on experiences of the supernatural When: Today at 7.15 pm Where: Tollygunge Club, HSBC Hall

 ROTTING RIVER: A committee set up by the high court has found the Hooghly most polluted in the stretch along Calcutta. A Telegraph picture

 The state environment department will discuss ways to tackle pollution in the Hooghly with representatives of the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and the civic bodies of Calcutta and Howrah on May 25.

 The members will try to resolve the issue of accountability between the CPT and Calcutta Municipal Corporation and take up other issues, said environment minister Sailen Sarkar.

 Sources, however, said the meeting might not be a cakewalk for the environment department, as pollution goes on unabated in several areas within Greater Calcutta, despite several warnings from the government.

 According to a committee set up by Calcutta High Court to monitor pollution in the Hooghly, the stretch of the river bordering the Calcutta and Howrah municipal corporation areas is the most polluted.

 The committee members on Saturday sailed downstream from Calcutta on a fact-finding mission and found the eastern bank more polluted than the western.

 We saw a huge amount of solid waste dumped in the river near Naihati and disposal of charred waste by Hukumchand Jute Mill, in Halisahar, said committee member and environmentalist Subhas Dutta.

 River expert and committee member Kalyan Rudra said several brick kilns have come up on the river banks, violating rules, near Kalyani. He also pointed out that incessant lifting of sand from the river bed has affected the foundations of several buildings in the vicinity, including Hooghly Mohsin College, in Chinsurah.

 We want the environment department to be strict on these violators, said Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer in the environment department and member-secretary of the committee.

 But virtually no action has been taken since August 2006, despite suggestions from the committee. All our suggestions have been forwarded to the pollution control board and other departments. But I cant say what is stalling implementation, said Mukherjee.

 Quoting from a high court order, Dutta said all departments represented on the panel are bound to implement its suggestions.

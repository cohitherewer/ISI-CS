The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hunt for kingpin agent

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Newspaper advertisements alone were not inserted as baits. Both Ranvijay Pathak and Mihir Jha, it now appears, had their accomplices planted across the city and its adjoining areas. They would pick up gullible candidates and work on them so that they rose to the bait. Police are on the look-out for one such, Montu, a 22-year-old youth. 

 Investigations reveal that it was Montu, who had introduced Avijit Saha the fourth JEE candidate who was arrested on Monday along with his father Utpal to Mihir Jha of Medictrance when the Malda-boy was preparing for JEE-07 at a coaching centre in Baguiati.

 Avijit has confessed to not appearing for the entrance test and yet securing a rank of 131. He had taken admission in Medical College, Calcutta, and was set to join classes from August 1, said Ajoy Kumar, the city detective chief.

 After interrogating the accused, the police have learnt that Montu hails from a village close to that of Jha of Kasauli off Darbhanga in Bihar. Montu was the man who handed over Rs 3 lakh, paid by Avijits grandfather, to him for the latters admission. Montus elder brother Ratan is a few years senior to Jha and is an alumni of the school from which Jha cleared his secondary examination. 

 In Avijits case, it was his physician grandfather, Biswanath, who was more keen on his grandson being admitted to a medical college than his father Utpal. Montu exploited the situation. 

 On the exam day, Avijit was sent off to Tarakeswar for a stroll while his dummy appeared on his behalf. The Malda boy was fully aware of this. There was possibly no way out, since by this time over half the amount had already been paid, said a senior investigating officer. 

 Police feel almost all the four candidates arrested so far were so entangled in the plot that even if they realised that dummies were being used against them, there was little they could do about it. 

 Both Ranvijay Pathak and Mihir Jha trapped the candidates promising sure admission through management quota. The candidates were even told that they would have to appear for the admission test, said an officer. 

 Months later, when almost half of the initial amount was paid up in lakhs, either Jha or Pathak would ask the candidates to fill up the form and hand over the admit card along with original mark sheets. 

 A few days before the exam or at times on that day itself, the candidates would be asked to stay away. In most cases, lodging a protest would mean forfeiting the amount already paid and goofing up chances of sure admission, police claimed. 

 Once the name featured in the list of successful candidates, both Jha and Pathaks men would wait outside for the parents to have a look at the list and then pay the remnant. It was only then that the originals including the mark sheet would be returned.

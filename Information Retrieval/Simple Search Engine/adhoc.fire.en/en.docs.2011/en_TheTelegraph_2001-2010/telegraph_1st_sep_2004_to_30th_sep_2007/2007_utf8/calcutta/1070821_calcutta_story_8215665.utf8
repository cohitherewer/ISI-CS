 The footfall count crossed 20,000 on the last day of the Travel and Tourism Fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium, despite the wet weather. 

 More than 15,000 had dropped in by the end of the second day, said Sanjiv Agarwal, the chairman and managing director of Fairfest Media, which organised the three-day event.

 According to him, the fair was 25 per cent bigger than last years edition, thanks to seven international participants and tour operators from 22 Indian states that drew the crowds before the Puja holiday. 

 The fair spilled onto the adjoining Kshudiram Anushilan Kendra to accommodate the visitors. 

 A lot of business will be generated after the fair. Some people plan on the spot. Others like to take their time. The good thing is that Indians are spenders and not just back-packers, said Agarwal.

 More people with spending power dropped in this year. The booming economy was reflected in the visitor profile. We are in for better times, he added.

 The 250 participants offered special discounts and facilities for on-the-spot bookings. The biggest in terms of participation was Uttarakhand, followed by Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Kerala.

 International holiday destinations included favourites like Thailand and Indonesia, along with Mauritius, Dubai and Sri Lanka. Switzerland was a new entrant.

 The Calcutta chapter followed the Hyderabad leg. The fair is a significant platform for the tourism industry. Calcutta is the biggest in terms of the number of people going out. The 26.1 per cent growth in passenger traffic at the Calcutta airport (domestic and international) in the past five years has been higher than that in Mumbai and Chennai, stated Agarwal. 

 Visa restrictions cannot be ruled out, with the threat of terrorism looming large. Hopefully, visa-on-arrival will soon be introduced across the globe. If Thailand can do it, so can the other countries, added Agarwal.

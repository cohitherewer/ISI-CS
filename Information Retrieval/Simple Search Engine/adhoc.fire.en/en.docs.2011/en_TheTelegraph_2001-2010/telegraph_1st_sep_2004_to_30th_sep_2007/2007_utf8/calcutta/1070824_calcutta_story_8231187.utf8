 Dredge to check flood

 - Trenchless technique to lift silt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic body will soon take up a Rs 402-crore scheme to dredge 28 km of underground brick-lined sewers, which the authorities claim will reduce waterlogging considerably.

 The project will start in November and has to end by May 2010, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Officials said the dredging will be carried out by micro-tunnelling a trenchless technique that has never been employed in the city to prevent disruption of traffic.

 In the first phase, 10 km of brick-lined sewers under Rashbehari Avenue, APC Road and Colootolla Street will be cleaned.

 The remaining 18 km of sewers under AJC Bose Road, Park Street, Vivekananda Road, Bidhan Sarani, Hazra Road and Ballygunge Circular Road will be taken up in the second phase, which will start in December.

 The citys underground sewer network measures 180 km, of which the length of man-entry sewers big enough to accommodate a human is 28 km. The rest are either non-man entry or pipe sewers.

 The 28 km of man-entry sewers are the lifeline of the drainage system in the city proper and will be desilted by the trenchless technique, said an official.

 We are opting for the trenchless technology to avoid disruption of traffic and also to prevent further damage to the century-old sewers that are mostly in a dilapidated state, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Municipal commissioner Bandyopadhyay said the three consultants that have been shortlisted are Michel BAU Gmbtt amp; Co.KG (Germany), Angerlehner (Austria) and APS Michigan Pvt Limited (US).

 The shortlisted executing agencies are Werm amp; Wink (UK), Dr Stein amp; Partner (Germany) and TTI (India), a subsidiary of Austrralias Consulting Engineers (Pvt) Limited.

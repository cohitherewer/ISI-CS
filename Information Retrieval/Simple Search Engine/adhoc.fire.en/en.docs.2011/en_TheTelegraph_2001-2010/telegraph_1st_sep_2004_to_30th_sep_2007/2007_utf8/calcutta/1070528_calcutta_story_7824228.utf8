 Students in fee quandary

 - Govt yet to decide on rate for management quota seats

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government is yet to finalise its stand on the fees for management quota seats in private engineering colleges, leading to confusion among students and also the authorities of the institutions.

 The confusion has heightened following the declaration of the state JEE 2007 results on May 21. Counselling for allotment of seats starts on June 25.

 A student whose rank is close to 8,000 said she wants to take up computer science and engineering. My rank is poor and I might not be allotted the stream during regular counselling. As for opting for a management quota seat, I cannot take a decision as I dont know the fees. I will not be able to afford very high fees, said the student, who did not want to be named.

 The government should have announced the maximum fees that a college can charge, said her father. Students in private engineering colleges now pay Rs 41,000 a year as tuition fees.

 The government had announced that private engineering colleges could set aside 10 per cent of their seats under the management quota from this year and that students being admitted in these seats would have to pay higher fees.

 But there is no announcement yet on whether the private colleges will have the liberty to fix the fees or whether all private engineering institutions will have to charge uniform fees.

 All private engineering colleges have been informed of the governments decision on management quota seats. But a decision on the fee structure is still pending, admitted Sajal Dasgupta, director in the technical education department.

 We have a received a letter from the government stating that 10 per cent of the seats could be reserved under the management quota. We have also been told that a different fee structure will be maintained for those seats. But we are yet to know whether the colleges will decide the fees on their own or whether there will be a uniform fee structure, said the principal of a north Calcutta college.

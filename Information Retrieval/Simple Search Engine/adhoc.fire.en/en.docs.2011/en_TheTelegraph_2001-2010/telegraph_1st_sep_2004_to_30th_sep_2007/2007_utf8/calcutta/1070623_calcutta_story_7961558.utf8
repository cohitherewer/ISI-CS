 Rimita Naskar, the 23-year-old college student who went missing from her Salt Lake home on June 12, was brought back to the city from a Baruipur home-cum-madarsa on Thursday night. The home authorities had informed police. 

 On Friday, Rimita was produced in Bidhannagar court, where she gave a confessional statement to a magistrate. She will undergo a medical test.

 According to Rimitas family members, a young zari worker of South 24-Parganas, called Nur Alam Gazi, had persuaded Rimita to accompany him to NRS Hospital and then to Baruipur. Gazi, who knew the girl for one-and-a-half months, had told her that his name was Raju Baidya and he was a trainee doctor at NRS.

 Rimitas father Shankar said that she had been under compulsion to go with Gazi, but refused to elaborate.

 In Baruipur, Nur and his brother Nurul kept Rimita at a friends house for two days. Then, she was moved to the in-laws house of another friend of Nur for three days, said the family members.

 On Sunday, Nur took her to Mohammad Ali Welfare Society at Suryapur. She was introduced as Nurbanu, a relative of Nur. She was even taught Arabic there. We seized some books from her, said an officer. 

 Rimitas language and lifestyle aroused the suspicion of the home officials. She was saying jal (water) instead of pani and chan (bath) instead of gosal. The home officials asked Nur to take her away by Thursday, added the officer. 

 When Nur did not do so, the home authorities got in touch with Baruipur police station, which informed Salt Lake police.

 We are fortunate that Rimita was rescued. Nur might have sold her. He and his friends had clicked a black-and-white passport photograph of her, said Shankar.

 The cops said theres a trafficking racket active in South 24-Parganas, whose members lure girls away from their homes by impersonating professionals with a sound financial and social background.

 We are trying to find out how Rimita reached Baruipur. We are also reviewing how her friend Tapan Das Adhikary is associated with the case, said North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar.

 Pratap Maity, brother-in-law of Tapan, who is in judicial custody till June 26, said the family would move the human rights commission against his detention.

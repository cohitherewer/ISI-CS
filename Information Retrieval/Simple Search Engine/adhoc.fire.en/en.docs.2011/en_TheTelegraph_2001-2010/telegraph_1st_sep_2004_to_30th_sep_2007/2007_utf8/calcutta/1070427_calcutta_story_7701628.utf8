 Starving dogs rescued

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A city-based NGO for animals, along with a team from Jadavpur police station, rescued seven starving dogs from a locked house at Bagha Jatin on Wednesday evening.

 Police said the dogs belonged to Chandra De, an aged spinster. De was admitted to Bagha Jatin State General Hospital on Saturday, following various complications like hepatitis, abdominal tumour and renal failure.

 Her neighbours said the dogs were left behind unattended and had been starving for three days. 

 Generally, these dogs dont come out of their house. But since Monday, they were barking round the clock. This drew our attention and we informed the local thana and Love-n-Care for Animals, an NGO, said Des neighbour Subrata Nandi.

 With the help of the NGO, local residents entered the house by scaling the wall. 

 The dogs have been suffering from severe dehydration. On Tuesday evening, we got an SOS. Our volunteer Dola Bhowmik rushed to the spot and fed the dogs. Of the seven, two dogs are suffering from cataract and scabies. We have started their treatment, said Sushmita Roy of Love-N-Care for Animals.

 She added that the NGO would take care of the dogs till De recovers and returns home from the hospital.

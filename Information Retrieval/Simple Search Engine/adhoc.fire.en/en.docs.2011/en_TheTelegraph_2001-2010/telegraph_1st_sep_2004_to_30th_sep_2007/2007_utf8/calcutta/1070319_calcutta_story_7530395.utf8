 Performance poetry

 The oral tradition is timeless; it is simply the tradition of passing on information orally. Much of this information is handed down in the form of poems, songs and stories. People in the Western world tend to look at the oral tradition as something belonging to the past, something that has lost its relevance in the age of the Internet. Yet, elsewhere, the tradition carries on regardless, thriving particularly where there are restrictions on peoples abilities to speak or where there is little access to the media. Back in Calcutta after six years, British poet Benjamin Zephaniah, popularly known as the oral poet or performance poet, presents a performance of his poetry, whose sound he says he can hear while writing his poems. The poet will also participate in a talk/discussion on performance and poetry at K.P. Basu Memorial Hall, Jadavpur University; tomorrow at 3 pm.

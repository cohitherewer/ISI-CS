The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Look and feel drive wheel deals 

 - Queue to customise cars

 Sudeep Kumar Ghosh bought a car for Rs 5.5 lakh and spent Rs 2 lakh on doing it up. Just the audio system and the stickers cost Rs 35,000.

 For Ghosh, who is a rally driver, most of the modifications are necessary, but the audio system and the stickers are only to give the vehicle the right look and feel.

 Ghosh is not the only one from the city spending lakhs on doing up his car. More and more motorists, both young and old, want to burn rubber in style. 

 The craze has caught on over the past two years. The car-owners used to experiment only with colours. Now, they are going in for other accessories, says Anand Bhawnani, the owner of Wheels, a car accessory shop at Triangular Park. We do something or the other to at least six cars daily.

 The makeover used to come in the form of leather upholstery in classy colours, PVC matting, perfume, sun film and audio system. Now, NFS (Need for Speed, a series of computer racing games) and The Fast and the Furious-style spoilers (a wing mounted on the back of the car), stickers, alloy wheels, tyres, xenon headlights and neons are the rage.

 Calcutta has become a little more car crazy. Everyone wants to stand out. And why not? Anyone can own an Esteem. What will make mine stand out is its look, says Anirban Mukherjee, who runs a factory and drives an Esteem. 

 Reverse cameras, DVD players and audio players with iPod compatibility have made it to the wish list of those who are customising their cars. Bigger tyres as well as bigger rims have also caught on. 

 Car customisation was popularised by games like NFS and films like The Fast and the Furious. I learnt about spoilers and vinyls from them, says Tirtharaj Roy, a 24-year-old, who also drives an Esteem. 

 The accessories cost between Rs 8,000 to Rs 1 lakh, which most of these car-owners are ready to shell out. With disposable income going up and more people buying cars, spending another Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 on customisation is not a big deal, says Amit Mukherjee, in charge of the Mirania showroom in Topsia. 

 But Calcutta still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of extracting the best possible performance from vehicles.

 In Calcutta, it is more about the looks and less about the performance. In Bangalore, for instance, people modify a car to enhance its performance, says Roy, referring to the drag races held in the city at night. 

 But for now, the motto of the motorists seems to be: add on or go unnoticed.

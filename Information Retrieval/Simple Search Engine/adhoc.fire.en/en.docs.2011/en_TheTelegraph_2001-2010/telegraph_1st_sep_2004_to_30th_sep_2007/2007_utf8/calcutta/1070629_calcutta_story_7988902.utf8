The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Laptops for lower courts

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court has decided to develop online connectivity with subordinate courts. It will allot laptops to all the 687 judges of the subordinate courts across the state.

 This will make the judiciary more accessible, said a high court official.

 The laptops will ensure round-the-clock connectivity between the high court and the lower court judges, a senior official at the chief justices secretariat told Metro.

 Problems caused by the delay in the shifting of documents from the trial courts to the high court will be solved after the new system is introduced, said another court official. The online network will help the high court to speedily dispose of the 2.52-lakh pending cases.

 Once the online networks are set up, lower court judges, too, can post their judgments on the website, from where the litigants can easily download copies of the orders. There will remain little need for coming to the courts for obtaining certified copies of court orders, pointed out the official.

 The decision follows an allocation of Rs 840 crore to the high court by the Centre to make various judicial services online. 

 The central government has already taken a decision to make various judicial services online.

 The introduction of online connectivity has resulted in cutting down the number of pending cases in the Supreme Court, he said. Two years ago, there were nearly two lakh pending cases at the apex court. Now, there are only 25,000 cases.

 Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar will formally distribute the laptops to 30 subordinate court judges on July 9, who have had their training at the Judicial Academy, Salt Lake. The other judges will have to collect their laptops from the court, said another high court official.

 The century-old high court building needs a thorough repair.

 During Wednesdays downpour, rainwater leaked into several courtrooms and bar association rooms, prompting the court administration to ask the state government to carry out repairs as early as possible.

 Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and two other senior judges surveyed the building to assess the extent of the damage. The judges found that the rainwater had leaked through the roof and formed puddles in courtrooms on the first and second floors.

 In the afternoon, the high court administration requested the government to send their representatives immediately to the court.

 The public works department is vigilant about keeping the building in a good condition and regularly undertakes patchwork repairs. However, the roof of the building needs to be repaired immediately, said a senior officer in the chief justices secretariat.

 A decade ago, the civic authorities had declared the annexe on the northern side of the building condemned. It has tilted on one side and experts fear there might be an accident any time.

 There is an acute shortage of space in the high court. A large number of registered lawyers have not been allotted space yet. So, it is difficult to vacate the old annexe building, said a high court judge.

 According to him, the construction of a new 10-storeyed building of the court, opposite the Assembly, was proceeding well. Five floors of the new building will soon be ready. The renovation of the annexe will be possible only after the courts and the bar offices are shifted to the new building. 

 Uttam Majumdar, former secretary of the high court bar association, said: The courtrooms on the second floor worst affected. We had repeatedly appealed to the high court administration to take steps in this regard.

 The lawyers also called for the setting up of a well-equipped medical unit in the building. At least 10,000 people visit the court daily. But there is only one doctor for the high court, city civil and sessions court and the New Secretariat, said Sardar Amjad Ali, a senior member of the high court bar association.

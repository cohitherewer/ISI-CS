 Two huge chunks of the verandah of a three-storeyed building broke loose twice within a span of two minutes, critically injuring a pedestrian on Beadon Street in north Calcutta on Monday morning.

 Around 9.30am, Niranjan Gudia, 48, was walking down the lane when a chunk of the verandah crumbled on his head and he was seriously injured. Local people took him to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. 

 A couple of minutes later, a larger chunk of the verandah collapsed but no one was injured this time. Local people immediately informed Burtolla police station.

 A portion of the verandah collapsed suddenly and fell on a pedestrian. He slumped on the ground, blood oozing from his head and nose. We immediately rushed him to Calcutta Medical College, said Atanu Das, who owns a paan-shop nearby. 

 Exactly two minutes later, another portion fell but nobody was on the pavement this time. People of the area panicked. We have asked the owner of the building to repair the damaged portion of the building but he didnt, another local resident complained. 

 According to the police, after the collapse residents of the building started fleeing along with their family members. Niranjan Gudia, a resident of Rabindra Sarani, was on way to his relatives house in Beadon Street when the mishap occurred. 

 A doctor attending on Gudia said that he was still not out of danger. We have started a case of negligence against the landlord, a police officer said.

 An officer of the building department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation visited the site and said that the owner of the building had not carried out maintenance work for several years and this resulted in the collapse.

 Dipankar Dey, the mayoral council member (buildings), said: The building is not in a serious condition.

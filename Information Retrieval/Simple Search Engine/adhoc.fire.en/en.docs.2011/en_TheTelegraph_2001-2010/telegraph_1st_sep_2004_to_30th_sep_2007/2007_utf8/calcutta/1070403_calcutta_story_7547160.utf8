 Tug-of-war: Market vs mores

 - LEASE CLAUSE HAS OUTLIVED UTILITY

 As the debate rages over the change in Salt Lakes character from a middle-class neighbourhood to a township for the rich and the mighty due to clandestine property deals questions are raised on the relevance of the Salt Lake Land Distribution Act.

 The rule book says land distributed on 99-year lease cannot be transferred or sold to any outsider. 

 Probably it was relevant in the early days to avoid real estate speculation, but it has outlived its utility, says Shabari Bhattacharya, owner of a flat in a cooperative society in HB block. 

 According to Bhattacharya, who now lives in the US, clandestine property deals mushroomed because of the ban, but in the absence of a well-defined property market, there has not been any price discovery for properties in Salt Lake. 

 Though there are no official rates, sources in the property market claim land price in the township ranges between Rs 15 and Rs 20 lakh per cottah in Sectors I, II and III, earmarked as residential. 

 The flats on illegally-transferred land cost around Rs 2,000 per sq ft, while flats in cooperatives are priced at around Rs 2,200 per sq ft.

 The fact that flats in far-away Rajarhat are selling at Rs 3,500 per sq ft proves that there has not been any reasonable price discovery of property in Salt Lake, adds Bhattacharya. 

 But for the members of the Bidhannagar Bachao Committee, the bigger issue is retaining the character of Salt Lake. 

 The entire purpose of creating a township like Salt Lake gets defeated if the market is allowed to rule, says B.N. Chatterjee, a member of the residents association. 

 To retain the townships character, the association has moved the high court. The court has given the government three weeks to file a detailed report on illegal land transfers. 

 For Subrata Sen, a senior citizen living with his wife in the GC block, the change is visible not only in the skyline, but even in the prices of basic commodities. 

 Everything costs more and it is difficult for the middle class to survive here, rues Sen, pointing to the presence of big brands in the township. 

 As property transfer is a sensitive issue, it becomes part of the campaign rhetoric during election campaigns in Salt Lake. 

 If the buzz from Writers Buildings is to be believed, the government has in principle decided to lift the ban on property transfers. 

 But the residents association has vowed to fight it. These are all political gimmicks and we will fight any attempt to change the rules, chorus the members of the committee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Enter, the soul doctor

 Guru Mantra 

 Deepak Chopra will be in Calcutta for a talk on Wednesday 

 Calcutta has a soul, and I guess I will be talking about the soul, Deepak Chopra told GoodLife, few days before his visit to the city for a talk presented by Calcutta Park Street Round Table and The Telegraph. Heres more on the man, his plans and what to expect on January 10 at The Oberoi Grand.

 Dr Deepak Chopra... 

 Doctor, teacher, author, healer, new-age guru and now even scriptwriter (he is working on the script of Sadhu, a Nicholas Cage film). It is very difficult to say who Deepak Chopra really is.

 His books like Grow Younger, Live Longer, 10 Steps to Reversing Ageing, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, The Spontaneous Fulfilment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence and many more have influenced many the world over. Chopra is also the founder of Chopra Center at La Costa in Carlsbad, California, where he continues to revolutionise common wisdom about the crucial connection between mind, body, spirit and healing. 

 He will talk about... 

 Chopras talk on Wednesday will explore the full range of human potential, touching upon various themes like our true nature, where do we come from, meaning and purpose of our existence and mechanisms of creation.

 Chopra explains how the greatest spiritual secrets are tied up in this simple answer. It takes a total shift in perception to realise that you are not in the world, the world is in you. 

 The programme will be held at The Oberoi Grand Ballroom. Registration begins at 6 pm and the evening will wind up after a book-signing session and dinner. 

 Some people attending the talk... 

 So, Calcutta finally gets an opportunity to host Deepak Chopra. His trip to the city is eagerly awaited by many, some highly inspired already by his teachings and some who are looking forward to witness his enigmatic persona, up close.

 The first communication from Calcutta Park Street Round Table on December 19 had entries pouring in immediately. And its all for a cause. Each donor pass will be contributing funds to build a school in Barasat for less-privileged children. 

 The crowd comprises a mix of Calcuttans corporate executives, CEOs, entrepreneurs, industrialists and professionals.

 Some voices from across the city, gearing up for an experience of a lifetime, can be heard loud and clear. 

 I have attended Dr Chopras talks in Delhi and Calcutta and have also learnt a lot from his partner Dr David Simon, online. He has two aspects one of a healer and the other of a teacher one teaches us how to be healthier and the other tells us how to be happier. It is amazing how he has superimposed Indian Ayurveda over and above western medical science and created a holistic health approach, says Tirthankar Das from Quantum Marketing.

 Eighteen of us have enrolled for the talk. We are looking forward to some work-related motivation, says Abhijit Das from Trammell Crow Meghraj. 

 I havent read any of his books but I have heard that he is a great motivator, says Subhash Saraf, an advocate. 

 The enrolment process...

 The 300-mark has been crossed and registrations will close around 400.

 Space constraint apart, the idea behind closing the door is to assemble a very select audience. 

 Forms are available at D211 City Centre, Malgudi Junction at 24 Camac Street and Infocircles at 4 Ganesh Chandra Avenue.

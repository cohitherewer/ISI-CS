 The troubles of Kumari Bhanumati, who has spent 39 years at Railway Orthopaedic Hospital in Howrah, are continuing. The hospital authorities now claim that she needs a surgery, but her mother, who has refused to take her home till she is cured, smells a rat. 

 Bhanumati needs surgery to remove stones in her urinary bladder. However, her mother has refused to sign the consent form, said the chief health director of the hospital, A.K. Saha.

 Sitamani Devi denied the allegation. She said the railway authorities were trying to send Bhanumati home and shrug off responsibility. 

 This is the third time they are talking of surgery. In 2005, they called us to the hospital and said Bhanumati needed surgery. Then they asked me to sign on a blank paper, which I refused to do, said Sitamani. The authorities sent Bhanumati twice to BR Singh Hospital, in Sealdah, for surgery. The doctors there refused to operate on my daughter and sent her back to the Howrah hospital. For the past 39 years, Bhanumati has not complained of stomach pain.

 The rail hospital doctors said Bhanumati had been shifted to BR Singh Hospital in October 2005 after she complained of chest pain. Her relatives refused to accompany her even though the hospital had arranged for an ambulance, said Saha.

 Bhanumati, the daughter of an Eastern Railway truck driver, was only five years old when she was admitted to the female surgical (orthopaedic) ward of the rail hospital in June 1968 with an abscess. She suffered brain damage and a cardiac arrest while recovering after a minor surgery. Later, she developed mental retardation, weakness of limbs and speech problems.

 According to the doctors, there is little chance of her recovery. Her father Baij Nath died in October 1997.

 The hospital stopped providing food to Bhanumati in January 2000. Her mother brings her food from home. The railway authorities deducted Rs 80,000 from Baij Naths dues after his retirement as cost of food and medicines served.

 Only a class of employees are served food by the hospital. Their dependants are provided food against a charge. The cost is deducted from the employees salaries, said Saha.

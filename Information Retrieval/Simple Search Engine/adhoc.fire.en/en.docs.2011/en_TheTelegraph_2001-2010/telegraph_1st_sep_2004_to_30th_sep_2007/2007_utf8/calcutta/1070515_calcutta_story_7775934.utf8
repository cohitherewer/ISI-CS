 Fifteen children have been starving at a private home near Madhyamgram, on the northern fringes of the city, for the past three days after the owner cut off food supplies. Five of the children had to drop out of school as their fees were not paid.

 Eighteen underprivileged boys, aged between 10 and 17, were staying at our home in Badu. The owner, Ranjit Chatterjee, has stopped sending us food because the children had complained to the governor about not being fed properly for days. The boys are now starving, said the warden of Sishumanjil, Biranjan Das. Three boys have left the home recently.

 Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi ordered an inquiry immediately after receiving the complaint on April 13. But no one from the district administration has yet visited the home to conduct the probe.

 Chatterjee did not pay me my salary for two months because I supported the children, said Das. He, too, is going without food. Some inmates of the home require medical attention but the authorities have refused to pay for the treatment.

 According to the warden, Chatterjee asked him in March to feed the children only twice a day. I was asked to serve the boys rice and water to cut down on expenses. It was not possible for me to continue with the menu as the children protested. When I told Chatterjee about the state of affairs, he asked me to continue serving them rice and water. The boys then complained to the governor, recalled Das.

 Chatterjee claimed the boys and the warden did not allow the food supplier to enter the home on Saturday.

 The supplier came with rice but no gas cylinder to cook it. He wanted us to sign a piece of paper stating that we had received the needed supplies. We asked him to go back, said an inmate of the home.

 My mother, a domestic help, pays the home authorities Rs 500 a month for my upkeep. But I still dont get a proper meal, complained another inmate.

 The owner of the home had lied about the number of inmates to his donors in the Netherlands, said Sishumanjil officials. The authorities had informed the donors that 76 children stay in the home.

 When we informed the donors about the situation, they inspected the home last week and stopped funding. Even the income tax authorities cancelled exemption of tax on donations made to the home, said an official.

 The commissioning of the Second Vivekananda Bridge, scheduled in a few months, will only add to the chaos at the busy Dunlop intersection.

 Reason: The state government has failed to live up to its promise of constructing a flyover over the Dunlop crossing to ensure uninterrupted traffic movement to and from the bridge.

 The number of vehicles hitting the crossing is likely to increase manifold once the bridge is thrown open, and the lack of a flyover would leave the spot in perpetual grip of snarls, fears officials.

 The government had promised, in an agreement with the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and Second Vivekananda Bridge Tollway Company, to construct the flyover three months before the scheduled inauguration of the bridge on March 31.

 Work is yet to start.

 The Dunlop intersection will become a vital link to the city once the bridge is thrown open. A flyover over the crossing would have ensured smooth traffic flow and better connectivity, said Ravindra Verma, managing director of the Tollway Company, which executed the Rs 646-crore project in association with the NHAI.

 The company is also worried that the absence of a flyover and the resultant chaos will affect toll collection on the bridge.

 People will not find it desirable to take this way if they find that even after paying toll tax, they will face congestion at the Dunlop crossing as before, pointed out Verma.

 PWD minister Manohar Tirkey said: Construction of the flyover got delayed, as the government could not decide whether the task would be handled by the urban development department or the PWD. It has now been decided that the PWD will be assigned the task. Work will start soon.

 Construction of the bridge, 50 metres downstream of the existing bridge, is almost over. We are coming close to the completion. Work on a part of the railway tracks near Bally station is not yet over. We will finish it by the end of this month, said Lala K.K. Roy, chief executive officer of the Tollway Company.

 Only vehicles with four wheels or more will be allowed to ply on the 6.1-km-long, six-lane bridge. Two and three-wheelers will have to take the old bridge, added Roy.

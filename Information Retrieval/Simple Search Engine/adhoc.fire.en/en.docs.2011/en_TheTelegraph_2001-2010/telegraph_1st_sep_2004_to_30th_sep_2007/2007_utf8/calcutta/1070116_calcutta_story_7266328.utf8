 Shroud over scout death

 - Post-mortem report awaited, escort teachers leave for home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The mystery shrouding the death of Scout Anil Harishchandra, 15, deepened further on Monday, with police groping for clues, the post-mortem report awaited and the three teachers who had escorted the team from Maharashtra leaving the city without informing the cops or Anils relatives.

 The post-mortem is yet to be conducted and without the report, we cannot determine the course of investigation, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas). The boys family members have submitted a fresh application, alleging foul play behind his death.

 Anils decomposed body, with just an undergarment on, was fished out of a pond on Saturday not too far from the Rajarhat camp site of the six-day Special National Jamboree of the Bharat Scouts and Guides to mark 100 years of the Scout movement.

 The Class IX student of a Mumbai school, who was identified by two tell-tale marks on his body and his locket, had come down as part of the team from Maharashtra.

 The sudden departure of the two teachers, Subhas Rajjak and Subhas Lad, has stumped police. They kept saying during the day that they were coming to the morgue but in the evening, we found all their mobile phones switched off. We went to their accommodation provided by the Scouts Authority at Kidderpore, only to be told that they had left the city, said Gupta.

 Anils relatives spent the day waiting in front of the morgue of NRS Medical College and Hospital. It was only in the afternoon that the officials at the hospital told us that they were yet to get some documents from police to conduct the post-mortem examination. The documents, we were told, would be submitted on Tuesday, said Ashoke Gupta, an uncle of Anil, who lives in Rishra.

 Several contradictory statements and unanswered questions have stalled investigation:

 Rajendra Nalwadi, the district training officer of the scouts in Mumbai, claimed that he had seen Anil having lunch around 12.30 pm on January 8. How did he go missing after that?

 A group of teachers said they had last spotted him near a big retail outlet in Baguiati. What was Anil doing there alone on a bandh day?

 If Anil had his lunch and then went for a dip in a shallow pond nearby and drowned, how did it go unnoticed by fellow Scouts or labourers working in New Town?

 If the teenager had drowned, why was his body found near the bank, and face up?

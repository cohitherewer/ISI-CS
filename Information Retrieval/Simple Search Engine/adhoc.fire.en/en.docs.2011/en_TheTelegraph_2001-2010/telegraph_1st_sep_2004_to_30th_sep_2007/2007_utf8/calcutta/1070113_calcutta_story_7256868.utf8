 Its that time of the 

 year when the soothing strains of ragas waft through Rabindra 

 Sarobar in the dead of night and the day breaks with people 

 streaming out of Southern Avenue, dazed under a nightlong 

 spell of classical music.

 The stage is set for the citys 

 most prestigious soiree The Dover Lane Music Conference, 

 from January 22-25, at the spacious Nazrul Mancha.

 In keeping with its tradition, 

 the 55th annual conference, presented by Desh, has 

 roped in some of the rising stars of Indian classical music 

 alongside the veterans, with a bouquet of instruments and 

 vocal music.

 The four-day soiree will be inaugurated 

 on the evening of January 22 in memory of the late shehnai 

 exponent Bismillah Khan. It all begins with a dhrupad recital 

 by Lopamudra Chakraborty, followed by Tejendra Narayan Majumder 

 on the sarod, vocal recital by Vasundhara Komkali and sitar 

 by Shujaat Khan. Vocalist Aswini Bhide Deshpande is the 

 last artiste of the night.

 The star-studded second day starts 

 at 8.30 pm with vocalist Kaushiki Desikan, before 

 moving on to sarod by Ayaan Ali Khan, vocals by Rashid Khan 

 and flute by Hari Prasad Chaurasia before concluding with 

 the voice of Pandit Jasraj.

 Stretching from 6.30 pm till midnight, 

 Day III features Purbayan Chatterjee on sitar, a vocal recital 

 by Ajoy Chakrabarty and then santoor by Shiv Kumar Sharma.

 The final evening (January 25) 

 begins with a vocal recital by Shubhada Paradkar, followed 

 by Shahid Parvez on the sitar, and vocals by Rajan and Sajan 

 Mishra. The final performance at the conference will be 

 by Ustad Amjad Ali Khan on the sarod.

 We have a shortened, till-midnight, 

 programme after a long time. We do this keeping in mind 

 how taxed the audience will be, and it is cost-effective 

 too, says Dover Lane Music Conference treasurer Bappa Sen.

 The conference is likely to draw 

 around 4,000 listeners to Nazrul Mancha. Of them, nearly 

 five per cent of the audience comprises foreigners who are 

 either tourists or students of classical music.

 This year, we have 75-year-old 

 vocalist Vasundhara Komkali who will be performing at Dover 

 Lane after 14 years, adds Sen.

 Sale of tickets priced at Rs 

 240, Rs 300 and Rs 420 have started from January 6, at 

 18/2 Dover Lane.

 We havent increased the price 

 of tickets over the years, and we bring the best musicians 

 to our listeners at a very affordable cost, stresses Sen.

 The Dover Lane Music Conference 

 has around 900 members on its rolls, including non-resident 

 Indians. Some of them come down to Calcutta to be at the 

 conference, says Sen.

 Started in 1952, the Dover Lane 

 Music Conference had 3, Dover Lane as its first venue before 

 moving to Singhee Park, Hindusthan Park, Vivekananda Park 

 and finally Nazrul Mancha.

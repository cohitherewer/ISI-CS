 21-day scan on bad roads

 The sorry state of a road with tram tracks. A Telegraph picture 

Calcutta High Court on Monday directed a committee to inspect the roads with tram tracks and a few other thoroughfares and submit a report in three weeks.

 The five-member committee had been appointed by the court in response to a petition by Manoeara Beghum, who pleaded for an order to the authorities to repair city roads.

 Following the panels report that the roads were in a deplorable state, the court had asked the agencies concerned to undertake immediate repairs.

 The agencies including the PWD, CMDA, CMC and the CTC filed a compliance report stating that repairs had started. 

 However, when the matter came up for hearing on Wednesday, petitioners counsel Idris Ali stated that most of city roads were in a poor state. Patchwork done by various agencies did not serve the purpose. The roads, especially those with tram tracks, have become dangerous.

 The division bench of Justice P.K. Ghosh and Justice B. Somadder then passed the order asking the panel to inspect the roads.

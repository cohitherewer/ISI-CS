 Eloquent images

 Photographs have the unique power to capture the pulse of any moment in time and immortalize it for all eternity. Besides investing an apparently prosaic, ordinary scene from daily life with poetic and, often, philosophic overtones, they uncover facets of human life and character that remain obscured from common perception. Hosted by Photographic Association of Bengal, Silver Memories, the ongoing retrospective of K.G. Maheshwaris photographs, brings together an assortment of outstanding images that offer visual delight and, at the same time, provide food for thought to the discerning viewer. Featuring works in a variety of styles, the show bears testimony to the veteran lensmans complete devotion and dedication to the fine art of photography. A self-taught artist, his creativity encompasses portraits and landscapes, still-life and candid shots, all of which offer interesting insights into contemporary life.

 Event: An exhibition of photographs by K.G. Maheshwari 

When: Till February 1, 3 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts, South Gallery

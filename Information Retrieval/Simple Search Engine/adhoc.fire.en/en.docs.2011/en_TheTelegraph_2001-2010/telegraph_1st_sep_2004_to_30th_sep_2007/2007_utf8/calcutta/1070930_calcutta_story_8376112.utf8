 Artist above labels

 Never mind what the secret of Paritosh Sens strength may be, but the vitality of the artist who turned 88 on Wednesday amazed most of the guests at his birthday party at Taj Bengal. He stood for hours, from well before the time the chief minister arrived.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted that Sens art, which may seem to some to be a throwback to cubism and Picasso, went above his head. But, nonetheless, he declared that Sen was the nations pride. The artist thanked him for being there. 

 The artist cut the huge chocolate cake. He and Bhattacharjee stood before a painting of a skimpily-clad cabaret artiste suggestively holding a microphone and smiled for the media. Success came quite late in life to Sen, who is also an accomplished writer, but he has taken things gracefully indeed. 

 The two made a round of the hall to look at the paintings. These were beautifully displayed against white hessian. The large charcoal drawings stood out against the light backdrop.

 The exhibition being celebratory, the huge mirror-lined hall was filled to capacity. Most noticeable were the self-portraits one showed him propositioning a voluptuous woman whose diaphanous sari left nothing to the imagination. The dirty old man was in keeping with his self-images resembling a baboon.

 There was the woman in grief with tears trickling down her cheek. In another work, she makes conversation on her cellphone with a shooting star burning the night sky behind her. Sen delights in painting varied vignettes of life, often with a strong element of satire. 

 It is easy to be dismissive of his art but Sen goes beyond labels. That comes cheap. He is a keen observer of life in which he is passionately involved. His life and art have become inseparable. The guests, too, were appreciative of his art and the generous flow of Chivas Regal.

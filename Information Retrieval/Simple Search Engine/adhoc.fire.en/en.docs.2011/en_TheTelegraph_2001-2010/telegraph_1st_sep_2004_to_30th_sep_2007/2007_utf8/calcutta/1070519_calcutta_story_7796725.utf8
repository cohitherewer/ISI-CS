 Polls push back test

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Elections are more important than examinations at Calcutta University (CU).

 The university on Friday postponed the undergraduate examinations scheduled on June 15 for the senate elections. The senate is one of the two policy-making bodies of the CU.

 The postponed examinations will be held on June 19 at the same time and the same venues, controller of examinations of the university Onkar Sadhan Adhikari said.

 More than 50,000 students will be affected by the change in schedule.

 Examinations of B.Com Part I (honours), under the 2+1 system, and B.Com Part II (general) and B.Com Part I (honours), under the 1+1+1 system, were scheduled on June 15. 

 Polls to elect six regular undergraduate and postgraduate students to the senate have been scheduled on the day. The elections will be held in the colleges affiliated to the university, which are also the venues of the undergraduate examinations.

 According to a senior official, it is mandatory for the university to hold the senate elections at a fixed time. Since the statuettes provide specific instructions regarding the election schedule, we could not postpone the polls, said the official.

 If the polls are so important, the university should have fixed the examination dates after finalising the dates of the senate elections, said a senior college teacher.

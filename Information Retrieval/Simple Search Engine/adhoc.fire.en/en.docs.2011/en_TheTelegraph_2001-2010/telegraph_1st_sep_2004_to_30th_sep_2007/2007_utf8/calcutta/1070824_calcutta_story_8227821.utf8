 Twin tribute

 Chitrakoot Art Gallery and Drishya, a film collective, jointly pay tribute to legendary masters of world cinema, Ingmar Bergman and Michelangelo Antonioni. The two-day event features a seminar followed by the screening of a film by the two great filmmakers. To be screened this evening is Bergmans Magician (1958), a modern fantasy portraying the magic-realistic world of Vogler the magician and his entourage. Vogler, his young assistant (who, in his better moments, is the magicians wife) and an ancient aunt comprise the interesting melange of characters, who are headed for a politically fraught performance. With its fairytale landscape, expressionist sets and sci-fic elements, the film effects upon the audience a willing suspension of disbelief. A landmark movie depicting alienated individuals in todays world, Antonionis Red Desert (1964; to be screened tomorrow) is about Giuliana, an unhappy wife suffering from an unnamed form of depression. An affair with an engineer helps her to come to terms with her physical and mental agony, but she is still hardly cured in the conventional sense. In the film, Antonioni places people against towering forms of technology, emphasising their loneliness and helplessness in the modern world of technological progress.

 Event: Screening session and seminar on films by Ingmar Bergman and Michelangelo Antonioni When: Today and tomorrow; 6.30 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

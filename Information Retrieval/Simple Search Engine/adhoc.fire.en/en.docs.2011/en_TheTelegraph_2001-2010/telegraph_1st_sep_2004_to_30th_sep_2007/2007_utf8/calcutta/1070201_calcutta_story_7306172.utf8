 With the wedding season on, its time to paint your palms, and more, in henna hues

 The elaborate orange patterns on her palms and the fresh fragrance of the leaves adding to the festive feel No Indian wedding is complete without the mehndi. From a simple shagun to high fashion, this traditional art is invariably a part of most celebrations.

 Legend has it that the practice of applying mehndi originated from Lucknow the land of Nawabs. A to-be-bride would keep the crushed fragrant leaves of the henna plant between her palms, which were then tied together during the night before her wedding. In the morning, the natural colour of the leaves would paint her palms red. 

 The tradition then made its way across to Rajasthan, where things were made easier by introducing cone work. Prior to this, the smooth greenish paste was applied with fingers, sticks and then toothpicks.

 From there to the salons of today, the mehndi has come a long way, in techniques and patterns. And it is no longer restricted to the palms. The hands, legs, back and almost every visible part of the body can flaunt painted pretty patterns. 

 With the wedding season on in full swing, GoodLife brings you the henna basics.

 Get started

 Most families have their select local mehndi artist who comes home before a special function. It is advisable to apply mehndi two nights before the big day so that the colour gets enough time to mature and reach that perfect shade of deep red, suggests Sujit Bhagat, consultant and skin therapist, Habibs Hair and Beauty Studio. 

 In Gariahat, in front of Basanti Devi College, some artists sit perched on stools working hard to paint your palms while you sit pretty on the pavement. They charge nominal rates ranging from Rs 100 per palm. At City Centre you can often spot a mehndi artist.

 Several city salons offer mehndi art. It is almost on a par with other recent fashion trends like nail art, feels Sujit. For self-help, design stencils are available off the shelf. So are gold, copper and silver highlights.

 Design pick

 At June Tomkyns, the focus is on elegant and simple designs. At Habibs, you can take your pick from Arabic or Rajasthani designs. 

 An Arabic design is very compact. From a distance it looks like a mess, but if you get up close, its very fine art, says Sujit. Rajasthani patterns, by contrast, are thicker designs. 

 Then there are the more snazzy designs with glitter add-ons. Jadau mehndi has become very popular now. Clients often ask for designs and colours to be matched with their outfits and bindis, points out Priscilla Corner, beauty expert and GoodLife columnist. 

 Tattoo talk

 Madonna sported a mehndi Om symbol on her palm and Demi Moore was one of the first celebs seen wearing the brown magic marker. Natural and non-toxic, it can get as simple or complicated as you want it to be.

 Temporary mehndi tattoos are simpler, fit into a limited time frame and involve minimal effort and mess. They are convenient and fade away with a single wash. Available in variable designs and even colours like blue and pink, they are a trendy upgrade to the traditional totem. Tattoo enthusiasts can also opt for different hues embodied in a single pattern.

 Do it yourself

 Application of mehndi involves skilled hands. But if youd rather get down to applying some yourself, keep a few things in mind. Once the mehndi powder has been mixed with water and made into a paste, add a little eucalyptus oil into the concoction. This will ensure a deep red-maroonish tone, advises mehndi and make-up artist Anurag Jaiswal.

 You can also apply some mehndi oil available in the market for a darker shade. Syrup made from sugar and water can do wonders, too, applied once the mehndi is semi-dry. 

 Dont forget: The deeper the shade of your mehndi, the stronger the love of your husband!

 A fire broke out in a plastic pouch-manufacturing unit, stacked with inflammable material, in Tangra on Tuesday afternoon.

 More than 50 firefighters in eight tenders fought for more than two-and-a-half hours to bring the blaze under control. 

 Seven men were working in Print-O-Graphics when the fire broke out around 12.45pm, but there were no reports of any critical injury.

 It could have been a disaster had we not arrived in time, said a firefighter. Timely intervention prevented the fire from spreading to other units in the building on DC Dey Road.

 A fire department officer said the 500-sq-ft unit was stacked with inflammable material and had only one door. There were a few portable fire extinguishers, but the workers did not know how to operate them.

 We are conducting a probe to find out the cause of the fire, said Amalendu Banerjee, of the fire department. 

 The police, too, have started a probe. We are waiting for the fire departments report, said M.K. Mukherjee, the additional commissioner I (eastern suburban division).

 The owner of the unit, Vikram Bhuwalka, could not be contacted. His father Biswanath said: Weve been running the unit since 1996 and this is the first time such a mishap has taken place. Material worth Rs 10 lakh has been damaged.

 He claimed the unit had obtained a licence from the fire department.

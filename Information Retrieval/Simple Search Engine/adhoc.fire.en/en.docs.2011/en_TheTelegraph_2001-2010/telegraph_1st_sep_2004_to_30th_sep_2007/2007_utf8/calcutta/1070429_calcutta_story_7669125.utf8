 Vat tales and road smells

 Save My Space 

 GARBAGE STREET: The open vat on Lee Road. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 The problem

 Calcutta is a city of contrasts. The stretch between a dazzling Forum and Sambhunath Pandit hospital on Lee Road any morning is evidence enough. The area, which has a number of small to medium-size offices, commercial establishments and a few residential units, also flaunts an open garbage vat that is a menace to the neighbourhood.

 The background

 Known as the Lee Road vat in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) parlance, the open garbage bin and the wastes from it stretch along 50 feet and cover almost two-thirds of the width of the road.

 The situation deteriorates during a CMC clean up, when the garbage-collection truck, several equipment and a mass of corporation workers convert the prime road into another Dhapa. Street dogs and birds ensure that some of this waste is disposed in the neighbourhood. The situation is unbearable when office-goers like me have to walk past the vat every morning and take in the foul smell, not to mention wading through heaps of garbage. Even after the garbage is removed around noon, the stench refuses to go.

 Who can help?

 As a regular visitor to the area, and not a local resident, I do not know which authority to turn to. Have I the right to lodge a complaint? My colleagues say that a number of representations to the local councillor and senior CMC members did not change the situation, as the CMCs standard reply was that this was the only big vat in the area that accumulated all the garbage of the neighbourhood. It is waste generated by you and we do not have any other place to place the vat, the CMC has apparently said. Fair enough, but cannot the CMC install a covered vat instead of an open one?

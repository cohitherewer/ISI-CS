The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Parambrata Chatterjee

 Actor

 Public display

 of affection is fine from fans, though

 at times it is a bit embarrassing, no

 matter how big or small a star is. What

 the girl did for Mahendra Singh Dhoni

 is big news because he is a national

 star and is always surrounded by security

 guards. I think its a bit crazy on her part, but then fans are a crazy lot. And Dhoni is very much a public figure so he should take it in his stride. Crazy things happen to us all the time. I have faced similar situations at the Calcutta Book Fair where people would come up to shake hands and end up holding on till I had to actually rescue my poor palm! I still receive crank calls even after changing my number twice. But then thats

 the cost celebrities have to pay. We

 are public figures after all.

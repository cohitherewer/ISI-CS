 The state forest department has alerted the Calcutta airport authorities on wildlife trafficking and smuggling of rare orchids to foreign countries.

 Extra vigil is needed on flights to Dubai, Bangkok, Singapore and Yangon, said V. K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden, state forest department. Two letters have been sent to the customs authorities in the airport, he said.

 Live falcons, rhino horns, animal furs, peacock feathers and wild orchids are being smuggled out through the airport, said Yadav. We have information about several rackets using Calcutta airport as their gateway.

 Falcons and peacock feathers are in great demand in West Asia. Other wildlife items are taken to the southeast Asian countries, from where those are handed over to buyers from across the world. 

 Endangered birds, furs, pelts and bones of various animals killed by poachers find their way to the airport through a network of poachers and smugglers. 

 Because of the lack of proper vigil, we often come to know of an instance of smuggling after the item has been smuggled out, said a forest department official.

 The authorities will soon organise a training programme for customs officials at the airport to make them more aware about the banned wildlife items. Border Security Force personnel have already undergone the training, conducted by the forest department, said Yadav. 

 The department has urged the state government to form separate cells to prevent smuggling of wildlife items. Coordination between the forest department and customs officials in the airport can check smuggling, Yadav signed off.

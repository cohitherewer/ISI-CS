 Lawyer protest hits court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 About 2,500 lawyers of the Alipore civil and sessions court observed a ceasework on Wednesday to protest alleged police atrocities.

 Some lawyers were allegedly roughed up by cops on Tuesday when they tried to prevent the re-arrest of Shiu Shankar Rajak, granted bail by the Alipore court. They had demonstrated on the court premises till late on Tuesday, demanding penal action against the policemen.

 The ceasework on Wednesday hit court proceedings with over 200 cases not being heard. The judges and magistrates attended court but all lawyers stayed away.

 Their counterparts in the city civil and sessions court and Howrah court also stayed away from the courtroom.

 Later in the day, Apurba Singha Roy, the chief judicial magistrate of Alipore sessions court, issued summons against two officers of the detective department and asked them to appear on Thursday.

 Police, meanwhile, produced Rajak, who was arrested on a theft charge after being granted bail in a case involving possession of firearms on Tuesday, before a Sealdah court. He was remanded in police custody till July 22.

 The agitating lawyers in Alipore court demanded his immediate release, crying foul against police action. Police stood their ground. Rajak is a criminal wanted in six cases, said a senior officer.

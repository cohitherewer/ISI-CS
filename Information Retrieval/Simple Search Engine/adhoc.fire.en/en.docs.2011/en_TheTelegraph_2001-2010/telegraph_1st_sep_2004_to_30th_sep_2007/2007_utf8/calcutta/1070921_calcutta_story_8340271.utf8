The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 University in 2008 debut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The proposed state-aided university in Barasat will start functioning from the 2008-09 academic session with 57 colleges in its fold.

 The colleges, all on the northern fringes of the city, are now under Calcutta University.

 The decision to bring the 57 colleges under the new university was taken on Thursday by a preparatory committee set up by the state government to suggest how the institute should function.

 Students who will be admitted to undergraduate courses in these colleges in the 2008-09 session will be registered under the new university, said Anil Bhattacharya, the convener of the preparatory committee. 

 Efforts are on to start postgraduate courses in 31 subjects in the university. The North 24-Parganas administration has been asked to locate a plot for the campus, he added.

 The government has decided on setting up the university to cut down on the workload of Calcutta University. 

 The decision was announced during the budget session of the Assembly in March.

 Overburdened with an increasing number of courses, examinees and answer scripts, Calcutta University has been urging the government to take steps to lessen its workload. Around 170 colleges are affiliated to Calcutta University.

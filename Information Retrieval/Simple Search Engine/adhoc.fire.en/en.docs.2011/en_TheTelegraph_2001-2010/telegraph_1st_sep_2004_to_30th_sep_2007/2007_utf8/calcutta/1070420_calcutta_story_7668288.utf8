 Indian identity

 Penguin Books India and Oxford Bookstore Calcutta present the launch of The Indians: Portrait of a People by Sudhir Kakar and Katharina Kakar. In this bold, illuminating study, the authors investigate the complex nature of Indianness: what makes an Indian identifiable to the rest of the world and, more importantly, to his or her fellow Indians? As the authors point out, despite ethnic differences, there is an underlying unity in Indias great diversity that needs to be recognised. Looking at what constitutes a common Indian identity, they examine in detail the predominance of family, community and caste in our everyday lives, and how it affects our attitude to marriage, our prejudices and concepts of right and wrong. Drawing upon three decades of original research and sources from the Mahabharata and Kamasutra to Bollywood movies and popular folklore, the authors have produced a rich and revealing portrait of the Indian people. After the launch, Buddhadeb Guha and Prof Sanjukta Dasgupta will be in conversation with Sudhir Kakar.

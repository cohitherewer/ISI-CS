The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ouster plea at stations

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 An advocate moved Calcutta High Court on Tuesday, seeking an order for immediate eviction of unauthorised hawkers from railway platforms. 

 Railway minister Lalu Prasad, made a party to the case, stands accused in the petition of going back on his commitment to drive away unauthorised hawkers from railway stations.

 The division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice K.K. Prasad will hear the matter on February 24.

 Petitioner Anjan Bhattacharya, who commutes daily on suburban trains on the Sealdah division, said unlicensed hawkers have occupied 90 per cent of the platforms, thanks to the callousness of the railway authorities.

 The petitioner alleged that the unlicensed hawkers are all backed by political parties, that earn lakhs daily as protection money.

 All major political parties are involved. Hence, its obvious that no minister will take the initiative to evict them. Only the judiciary can give relief to around 65 lakh commuters who come to Calcutta daily through the Sealdah or Howrah divisions, the petitioner said.

 The Government Railway Police (GRP) refuses to register complaints against the hawkers, as most of them enjoy the patronage of local toughs, he claimed.

 A number of people, mostly daily railway commuters, have written to the lawyer expressing their willingness to join the case in his support.

 Asked to comment on the petition, railway counsel Uttam Majumdar said: Whatever we have to say, we will say in court.

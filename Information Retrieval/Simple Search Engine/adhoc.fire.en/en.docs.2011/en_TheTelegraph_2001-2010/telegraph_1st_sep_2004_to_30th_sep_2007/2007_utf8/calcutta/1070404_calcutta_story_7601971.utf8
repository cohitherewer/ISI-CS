 Expert help for your household

 CHORES GIRLS: Tips on cooking being imparted at Nayeedisha, on Sarat Bose Road. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha

 Shabana Begum can cook pasta in a nutritious manner, arrange the table and serve the fare in a pleasing presentation. She can also answer the phone in English, do the laundry and pest control and even handle minor household repairs.

 The 19-year-old from CIT Road is one of the girls at Nayeedisha, an NGO seeking to rid domestic helps of the stigma of a menial vocation. 

 The aim is to enhance the quality of domestic chores offered and hence, give it the recognition of a profession of dignity, explains Pradip Chopra, one of the trustees.

 The initiative, which was kicked off with 17 girls this February as a forum to equip them with focused skills as domestic helps, has now grown into a plank for empowerment through employable skills, adds Rimple Mehta, director of the programme.

 The 22-year-old sociology graduate from St Xaviers feels with the number of working couples increasing, theres a huge demand for domestic help with all-round skills to manage the house efficiently.

 Domestic helps are usually poorly paid, the working conditions are appalling and their abilities are taken for granted. We are trying to provide them with the skills required to harness their potential, so that they can provide for themselves, says Rimple.

 Naseema Khatun, barely out of her teens, comes to Nayeedisha on Sarat Bose Road from her modest Moulali home every day, can make delicious hakka noodles and is also fond of rangoli. Her father is a cake-seller, and doesnt want her to work. But she wants to learn English and work in a caring household.

 We not only teach them how to prepare different dishes, but the emphasis is also on cooking hygienically and on nutritional value because todays generation is extremely health-conscious, says Trishya Chowdhury, who works with the girls on culinary skills.

 The six-to-eight-week, two-tiered course designed by Deepali Singhee, principal, JD Birla Institute of Home Science and a trustee, covers in its bouquet such life skills like stress management and general etiquette, besides beauty care, first-aid and home nursing and use of fire-fighting equipment.

 The next step is providing driving lessons to girls to become taxi drivers, on a request from the state transport department. We are sourcing the students (in the age group of 18-35) through another NGO, Path Welfare Society, which verifies their identities, and we crosscheck the identity proof on the detailed application form, declares Rimple.

 During the training period, the girls are provided with food and a monthly stipend of Rs 500. While the present batch is ready to pass out and move into their respective workplaces, efforts are on to grow the initiative and also include boys in the next batch.

 We are relying on personal contacts and word-of-mouth for placement. We are spending approximately Rs 2,500 on each girl. But such is the demand for these skills set, we are confident of recovering the amount and more through placement fees at a later date, says Chopra.

 Nayeedisha is also looking at the impending boom in the hospitality industry, more hospitals and restaurants, and of course, the growing number of 24x7 jobs being created in the city, to place its trainees.

 Politics and the body

 - Crustacean and ancient strifes

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Chhatrapati Duttas Kaar Land

 Aakriti Art Gallerys group show is focused on the human body, but is for some strange reason, titled Agony and Ecstasy. The show could have done easily without it, for there is hardly any evidence of either emotion in the works, some of which can speak for themselves.

 A large human head sprouts limbs like a crustacean in Sheikh Sahajahans canvas. In another work, a womans head is imprinted on a pair of gloves, one of which is calibrated. In his reverse glass paintings, a human body hangs in space. In all his works, lines sometimes fanciful and endowed with a life of their own are what really stand out.

 Chhatrapati Dutta continues to use the metaphor of the map to explore the theme of boundaries geographical and psychological. His acrylic on canvas, Kaar Land, takes on a political significance in the backdrop of the acquisition of farmland for industry.

 The huge head of an ancient statue stands out in a field of darkness surrounded, as it were, by galaxies and planetary systems in Aditya Basaks mixed media on board. His painting Sky I takes on cosmic significance, as a huge creature with the head of a giant fledgling emerges on what seems like a blood-splattered universe. Basak creates a complex image where his powerful figurative drawing often becomes indistinguishable from the backdrop suggestive of strife and turbulence.

 Lines have always been the forte of Partha Pratim Deb and in these drawings, he creates webs which on their own seem to metamorphose into human forms one like a mummy, draped as it is with never-ending puttees and that of a large cockerel. His sense of humour livens up the proceedings. One cannot miss the followers at the feet of the great guru.

 Tapas Konars evocation of gods and goddesses with their multiple limbs and eyes and multiple perspectives are not quite as clearly marked out as in his earlier works. They have become nebulous and this vagueness perhaps marks the beginning of a transition.

 Manoj Dattas dolls mark a departure from his folksy style. Here, he has shunned all details and the colourful lines look playfully nave.

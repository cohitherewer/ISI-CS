 The clubs a stage

 Office theatre may have petered out, but some of the citys elite clubs are taking to the stage for the sole purpose of entertainment, as a means of relaxation and bonding. DIs staging of Manoj Mitras Munni O Saath Chowkidaar at Gyan Manch was yet another instance of this fast-growing trend.

 Till two years ago, club productions were restricted mainly to Sampriti, the annual inter-club drama festival, but quite a few clubs Calcutta Club, International Club and DI are now managing to put up full-length productions in Bengali and English.

 Started by Outram Club four years ago, Sampriti drew response from DI, Calcutta Rowing Club, Lake Club, Calcutta Club and International Club. Later, they were joined by Dakshin Kolikata Sansad and Indian Life Saving Society. The drama festival has been held at Birla Sabhagar and Uttam Mancha with clubs taking turns to host the programme. 

 From February 14-18, Lake Club will host it at Uttam Mancha. The time limit for plays is restricted to one hour so that two plays can be staged each evening. It is not a competition; the aim is to promote brotherhood among the clubs, says Raju Raman, a member of DI.

 Usually its the club members who select, direct and present plays though they do hire halls, sets, make-up artistes and other technicians. We always strive to give our plays the polish of a professional theatre production, says Jayajit Biswas, who featured in Munni and is a member of DI and International Club.

 The desire for perfection led DI to seek out the directorial skills of theatre director Jayati Bose, who confirms that club members are taking theatre seriously. 

 Most DI members are senior professionals like doctors, architects and executives, but they came for rehearsals. And they did quite well, says Bose. 

 But not all are amateur actors. Some like Bijoy Chatterjee, a DI club member, makes time after his corporate job to pursue his stage passion. It is encouraging to see that clubs are thinking of using their time on something other than song, dance and booze, says Chatterjee, a cast member in Bratya Basus Hemlat: Prince of Garanhata.

 Just doing things together, sharing the passion, is wonderful and when the audience claps it seems well worth it, adds Biswas.

 While choosing plays, clubs tend to go for short, crisp pieces. Manoj Mitra and Badal Sircar are top favourites, but Michael Madhusudan Dutta (Buro Shaliker Ghare Rwon), Rabindranath Tagore and Arun Mukhopadhyay (Marich Sangbad) have also featured alongside stage versions of popular films and serials. So far, Calcutta Club is the only one doing two plays annually, one in English and the other in Hindi.

 But then there are some clubs that dont feel the need to make theatre a part of their social calendar. As Ashit Luthra of Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) laughingly says: No theatre for us; ours is a sporting club, a most boring organisation! G.D. Bhaia of Hindusthan Club says they dont have any plans to do theatre either. 

 Saturday Club has got professional troupes from the city (Usha Ganguli) and Mumbai (Tom Alter) to stage plays on its premises, but things may take a more dramatic turn soon. There have been some sporadic efforts at play-reading, but maybe in the near future we will be able to involve club members in full-fledged theatrical presentations, hopes Saturday Club vice-president Renu Roy.

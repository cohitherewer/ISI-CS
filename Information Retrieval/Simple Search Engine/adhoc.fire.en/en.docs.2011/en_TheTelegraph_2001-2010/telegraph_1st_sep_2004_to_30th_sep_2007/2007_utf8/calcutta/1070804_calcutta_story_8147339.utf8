The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Arbaaz Khan

 You are a very warm-hearted, intelligent and humble person. Your generosity makes you a great hit with others. For you, music has therapeutic value. You are adjusting by nature and easy to get along with. A regular sport will do wonders for your mind and body. Do not be so impulsive. Depression is your greatest enemy.

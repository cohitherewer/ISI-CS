 Conditional access system (CAS) has officially been rolled out in the city, but the technology in place is conditional only in name.

 All pay channels are being routed through set-top boxes in parts of south Calcutta, where CAS was launched on January 1. The system was supposed to provide viewers with the freedom to choose pay channels.

 According to a Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) directive, pay channel signals must be encrypted by multi-system operators (MSOs) before being distributed. The MSOs that are part of the CAS roll-out have not abided by this directive.

 The term conditional access is meaningless now. The signals have not been encrypted by the MSOs. Hence, the system of determining the number of subscribers accessing pay channels is not working, explained an industry insider. 

 Abhijit Sanyal, nodal officer appointed by TRAI, said the MSOs have failed to instal the software required to activate the subscriber management system. Most of the MSOs operating in the areas where CAS was implemented could not instal the software due to technical problems. The situation will hopefully improve over the next fortnight, he added.

 The MSOs have failed to explain why the infrastructure is not in place despite a nearly seven-month notice.

 Several people have also complained to TRAI that the MSOs are dictating terms to the viewers. We expected a stiff challenge in implementing CAS. Unfortunately, we dont have the manpower to take care of all the hitches. We have appointed technical experts to visit the cities where CAS has been implemented and look into the complaints, said TRAI chairman Nripendra Mishra.

 If our technical team finds that the subscriber management system is not in place and channels are not being encrypted, we will take action against the guilty. As of now, we are trying to help everyone, explained Mishra.

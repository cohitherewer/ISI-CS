 Dance aid to childbirth

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dance away the pregnancy blues that, in a nutshell, is A.V. Satyanarayanas tip for mothers-to-be.

 The Bharatanatyam exponent from Bangalore was in town on Monday to attend a gynaecology conference, where he promoted dance as a stress reliever and aid to natural delivery.

 Half the deliveries these days are by Caesarian section. This is because people lead sedentary lives. Women need to exercise during pregnancy, but yoga and other accepted forms of physical activity do not engage the emotions the way dance does, explained Satyanarayana, who works as a deputy manager at State Bank of Mysore. 

 A performance in his home town seven years ago made Satyanarayana take up dance therapy. An audience member suggested that I use dance for medical purposes. After working with diabetics, he started the programme for pregnant women two years ago. 

 Through dance, women enter a world of imagination. I invoke the character of Yashoda taking care of infant Krishna, since every mother would like to have a child as pretty and mischievous as him, said the dancer.

 Simulating the movements of Yashoda churning butter, beating rice and grinding sugar for making Krishnas favourite dishes, Satyanarayana transports pregnant women to a a world of imagination away from the anxiety of daily life, exercising the muscles and bringing joy.

 Actions like the drawing of water from the well strengthens the respiratory system, which aids labour, claimed the dancer. Dance therapy does not guarantee natural delivery, but increases its possibility. 

 Satyanarayana conducts three-month workshops in Bangalore. The charges are Rs 500 for two to three classes a week. The steps take about five days to pick up and do not require an intimate knowledge of dance, he stated.

 Starting in the fifth month of pregnancy, the classes continue till the seventh month. The movements are culled from Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kalaripayattu and other folk forms.

 Around 100 autorickshaw drivers blocked the busy crossing of Royd Street and Elliot Road on Wednesday afternoon, throwing traffic in several parts of central Calcutta out of gear.

 The blockade was in protest against the alleged assault on one of the drivers by a traffic sergeant on Tuesday afternoon, though no police complaint has been lodged by the victim.

 Nisar Ahmed, the officer-in-charge of Park Street police station, said auto drivers who ply on the Chandni Chowk-Park Circus route had blocked the crossing for almost an hour since noon.

 Our officers tried to persuade them to lift the blockade, but they did not relent. Their allegation that a traffic sergeant had misbehaved with an autorickshaw driver and slapped him was baseless, Ahmed said.

 Local residents, however, alleged that the autorickshaws are posing a threat to the safety of pedestrians and motorists.

 The drivers do not stick to any traffic norms and add to the chaos on the road, resulting in frequent bottlenecks. They often misbehave with passengers, said Sabir Alam, a resident of Ripon Street.

 He demanded that the police take stern action against errant drivers.

 Showdowns between auto-rickshaw drivers and the policemen have become a common feature on the route.

 A fortnight ago, an auto-rickshaw driver manhandled a traffic constable and tore his uniform on Free School Street, after being fined for violating traffic rules.

 The driver heckled the constable in full public view. He was arrested and is in judicial custody, said an officer of Park Street police station.

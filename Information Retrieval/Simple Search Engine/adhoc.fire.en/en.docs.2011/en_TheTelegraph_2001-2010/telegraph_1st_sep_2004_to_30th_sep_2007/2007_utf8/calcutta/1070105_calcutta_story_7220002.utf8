 You share your birthday with...

 Diane Keaton 

 Youre good at handling tension at the workplace. Youre not afraid of challenges and are very conscientious about your job. Youre conservative in money matters and wont spend unnecessarily. You never mix finance and friends, choosing neither to borrow nor lend. You get angry quickly but cool down just as fast. Kusum Bhandari

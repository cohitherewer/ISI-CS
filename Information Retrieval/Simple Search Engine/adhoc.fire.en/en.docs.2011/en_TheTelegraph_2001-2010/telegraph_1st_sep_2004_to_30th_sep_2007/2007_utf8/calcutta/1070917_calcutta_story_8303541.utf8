 Hernia clinic this month

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A hernia clinic with state-of-the art equipment will open in Calcutta this month. Hernia is a weakness in the abdominal muscle, which allows the intestinal contents to protrude abnormally, causing pain, incapacitation and even death. 

 Inguinal in males and femoral among females are the commonest types of hernia, said Alok Banerjee, general surgeon and gastroenterologist, who will be part of the specialised team to treat hernia at NG Medicare Nursing Home, on Rashbehari Avenue.

 Hernia is treated by setting a flat mesh on the hole from where the abdominal contents protrude. In such cases, the rate of recurrence is high, as the mesh does not cover the entire hole, said gastroenterologist Sanjay De Bakshi. 

 The team uses a three-dimensional mesh that covers the entire hole and hence, the risk of recurrence is less, he said, adding that 300 patients have been operated on successfully. The surgery takes less than 30 minutes and the patient is up and about by the next day.

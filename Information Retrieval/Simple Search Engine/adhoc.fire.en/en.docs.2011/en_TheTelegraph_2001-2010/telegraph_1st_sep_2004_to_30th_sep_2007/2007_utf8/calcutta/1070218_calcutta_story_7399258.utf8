 Paisa wise, rupee foolish

 He built up his little fortune, coin by coin. Only to realise that they were no longer in currency when he wanted to encash them. 

 Raju Hembram, 50, is poorer than he was. He has been begging at Howrah station for 30 years and had piled up a collection of coins through these years, keeping aside a part as his savings. He kept them in gunny bags in the jhupri that he shares with fellow beggars in Salkia, Howrah. He did not count the money, but thought it would amount to a few thousands, something to fall back on in future. Now he feels helpless. The coins are out of currency. 

 I am in a very difficult situation. There are no takers for them now, says Hembram. 

 The city is full of beggars like him. Yahi hamara zindagi ka jaama puji tha magar ab woh bhi bekar hai. (These coins were my savings that I had collected over the years But now these are redundant), laments Mohan Lal, a frail man who can be spotted on most days seeking alms at Burrabazar.

 Now in his mid-60s, he came to the city from a village in Uttar Pradesh 15 years ago and took to begging. He shares a jhupri at Nimtala with fellow beggars, where he kept the money. To discover recently that it was of no use. 

 But Lal is better off than Hembram. He sold off his savings to a foundry in Howrah two months ago. 

 I had 10 kg of coins. There were coins from 1 paisa to 20 paise. The foundry-owner paid me Rs 20 per kg. I was almost in tears but had no option, he said, as tears rolled down his weather-beaten cheeks.

 Finding themselves in the lurch beggars are now selling off their lifetime savings at throwaway prices. Its very painful, says Shyam Bandopadhyay, who runs Beggar Research Bureau in Salkia, Howrah. He says that many beggars have approached him with the problem. 

 They often do not know how much money they have, he says, as it is impossible to count so many coins. But many of them would have saved up to between Rs 5,000 and Rs 7,000, he adds. 

 They are usually kept in the jhupris that beggars live in, without fear of theft, because the jhupri is usually shared by people who trust each other and keep an eye on others money. But frustrated with their coins, two beggars had once kept their gunny bags full of coins with Bandopadhyay for some time. 

 For the 55-year-old Ramadhin and his wife Kumari, a childless couple who have been begging for over 20 years. They are an itinerant couple who once begged at Colootola, but move from place to place now. For them the profit margin was slightly better. 

 We had 21 kg of coins and were paid Rs 21 per kg, Ramadhin mumbled. We had kept the coins in two tin boxes as we thought they will help us survive in our old age. But now, we are left with nothing and have to starve, Kumari said. The couple sold off the coins to a foundry owner in Salkia. 

 Bandopadhyay said this was inevitable as authorities have been silent on the problem. There has been no communication from the Reserve Bank of India on the fate of these coins. I had written a letter to the RBI governor, but did not get any response, he said.

 Bandopadhyay estimates that there are about 50,000 to 60,000 beggars in the city. Many of them face the same problem. 

 Only foundry owners are happy, though they wouldnt say it. Its very sad. Nearly 10 such beggars have sold off coins to me, said Omprakash Jha, a foundry owner in Belilious Road, Howrah.

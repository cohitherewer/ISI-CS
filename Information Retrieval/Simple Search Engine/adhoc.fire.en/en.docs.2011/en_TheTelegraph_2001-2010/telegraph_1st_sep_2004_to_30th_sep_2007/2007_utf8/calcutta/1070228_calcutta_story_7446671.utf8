 Remember the mesmerising effect of A Bugs Life. The animated epic of the miniature world, based on the lives of ants and a grasshopper, created ripples in the kids world and also spread awareness about the unknown microscopic world.

 With a similar aim, Bugs, a 3D film based on bugs and insects, will be screened at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM), on the National Science Day.

 We often kill insects without realising their importance in our lives. Every insect plays an key role in our ecological cycle. Our aim is to delve deep into the subject and help children understand the microscopic world, said Jayanta Sthanapati, director of BITM.

 The 19-minute documentary was shot by a Belgium-based environmental NGO, Barco and was edited at Oxford Studio, London. It is based on some of the rarest species of bugs and insects found in the rainforest of Borneo.

 The main attraction of the movie is the 3D effect, which has made the scenes look very real. You feel you are part of the bugs world. The lifecycle of preying mantis and butterflies are the best scenes, BITM official Goutam Seal said.

 The movie will be screened at a special theatre in the museum as part of the National Science Week programmes. The film show will be inaugurated by commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen.

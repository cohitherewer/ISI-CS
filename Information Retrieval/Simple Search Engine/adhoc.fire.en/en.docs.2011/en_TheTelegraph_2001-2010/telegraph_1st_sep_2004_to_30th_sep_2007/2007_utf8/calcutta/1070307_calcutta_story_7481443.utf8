The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Laptop, cellphones vanish at security check

 - Air passenger loses valuables at X-ray machine

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A laptop and two cellphones of an IT professional have gone missing from the airport during the final security check at the domestic terminal. 

 Judhajit Sen Majumdar, a resident of Baisnabghata, in south Calcutta, had placed the items on the conveyor belt of an X-ray machine at the airport last Friday. They could not be found after that.

 Sen Majumdar was undergoing the security check to board an Air Sahara flight to Bangalore. On Tuesday, he provided details of his mobile phones and laptop to police.

 I will soon leave for the US and take up a job there. I was going to Bangalore for training in this connection, said the IT professional. 

 The flight was scheduled to take off at 10.30 am and he reached the airport more than an hour early. After checking in my registered luggage at the airline counter, I headed for the security hold area, recounted Sen Majumdar on Tuesday. 

 After queuing up for a short while, I reached the X-ray machine. I deposited the laptop and a bag containing the two mobile phones on the conveyor belt of the machine, he continued.

 After a body frisk by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel, barely a metre away from the machine, Sen Majumdar proceeded to its other end to collect the articles. 

 I waited around 10 minutes for the laptop and the hand bag to emerge. When they didnt, I thought the security personnel had seized them, said Sen Majumdar. I asked the securitymen whether they had kept the laptop and bag. They told me that they hadnt and asked me to look for them properly.

 When the gadgets could not be found, Sen Majumdar raised a hue and cry, prompting the CISF men to start a search. They took me upstairs and also contacted the airline officials, but the laptop and phones could not be traced, stated Sen Majumdar. I had to cancel my journey and stayed at the airport till late at night. I reported the matter to the authorities, including the airport manager. He later filed an FIR at the airport police station. 

 District police and the CISF are investigating the matter, said airport director V.K. Monga. 

 According to CISF officers, the entire building was searched but the gadgets could not be found. The closed-circuit television recordings were shown to the passenger, but to no avail. The items could have been taken away by another passenger, stated a senior CISF officer. 

 We have not found a clue so far. The probe is continuing, said a police officer. He could not recollect a similar incident at the airport. 

 Officials of the airline said a rescheduled ticket had been issued to Sen Majumdar. We have sympathy for him, said an official, before pointing out that hand baggage was the responsibility of the passenger. If valuable items are being carried in registered luggage, we advise passengers to inform us and have them insured. 

 Such incidents should be dealt with strictly, asserted Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI).

 Clean chit for clinic

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state health department on Thursday gave a clean chit to Mission of Mercy Hospital, in connection with an allegation of a patients death due to negligence. 

 Patrick Cranston, 57, died last Saturday, allegedly after the hospital authorities asked the sister in-charge in the ICCU to stop all services and medicine, as Cranston had failed to pay his dues. Cranston had been suffering from several critical ailments, including diabetes and cardiac disorder. 

 Following his death, a complaint was lodged. And the state government ordered a probe into the case. 

 A two-member team of the state health department visited the hospital on Tuesday and the report was placed on Thursday. 

 There was no negligence on our part. The probe revealed that Cranston received treatment till his last breath. A small problem between the administration and a section of doctors was blown out of proportion, said Sanchita Bakshi, director of health services.

 However, she admitted that Mariamma George, assistant to Jatrik Biswas, medical administrator of Mission of Mercy, was at fault for writing a harsh note to the sister in-charge on duty.

 The doctors, who were agitating against the administration, alleged that the probe team did not speak to them. It was not a neutral probe. They should have taken our view. They just spoke to the administration and went away, claimed a doctor.

 Guide to healthy cuisine

 Using a lot of oil in cooking causes unbalanced nutrition, various illnesses, and even premature death due to coronary heart disease. Master chef Sanjeev Kapoors concern about modern unhealthy lifestyles has already made him a staunch proponent of nutritious, fat-free home cooking. Published by Popular Prakashan, Kapoors No-Oil Cooking takes on bad cholesterols, lipids and trans fats with a collection of recipes for cooking without additional fat or oil. This evening, Crossword and Popular Prakashan present the formal release of the book (price: Rs 295), which introduces us to the concept of a wholesome, tasty, low-calorie daily diet, empowering us to be in command of our own lives. Filled with a range of healthy recipes from piping hot soups and amazing starters to exotic main-course dishes like Baked fish in red masala, Red capsicum soup with lemon and Thai green curry with vegetables, Kapoor has also whipped up guilt-free desserts like Anjeer ka meetha and Chhanar payesh to pamper the sweet tooth. The product of intensive research, every recipe has been repeatedly tested and presented in a user-friendly format to enable even novices in the kitchen to prepare hygienic, appetising delicacies with flair and confidence. The launch will be followed by a discussion with the author on special oil-free recipes.

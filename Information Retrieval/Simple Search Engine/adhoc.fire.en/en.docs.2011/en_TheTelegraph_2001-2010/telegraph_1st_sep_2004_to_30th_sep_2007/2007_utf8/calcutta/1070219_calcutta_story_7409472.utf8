 Lalita Devi Goenka in August 2004; Leela Deb the month after; Tara Chand Banka and wife Sarada in April 2005, followed by Dipti DCruz in May. Finally, Ravinder Kaur Luthra this month. 

 Six elderly residents of the city, murdered by their trusted domestic helps from the hinterland. All the killings were prompted by greed fanned by their well-heeled employers, according to psychiatrists. 

 With expectations rising, people with personality disorders are bound to succumb to the temptation of making a quick buck. For a domestic help, the sense of deprivation is aggravated in an environment of affluence, explains psychiatrist Ranadip Ghosh Roy.

 Police feel the same way. Neekar Yadav, or Nikku, told us that he wanted to turn a new leaf and end his life as a domestic help of the Luthras of Ballygunge Circular Road. The abundance he saw around him made him greedy. A huge amount of money and jewellery were kept in the familys flat and Nikku knew about it, according to a detective department officer who interrogated the 24-year-old aide, who confessed to murdering Ravinder.

 People who commit such murders are under different kinds of pressure, from within and outside. As a result, they end up losing their sense of restraint, adds psychiatrist Ghosh Roy.

 Police feel householders need to find out more about their trusted hands and change certain habits to avoid becoming victims of murderous ploys. 

 It is never advisable to flaunt ones assets. One might not be in a position to visit the bank frequently or maintain a locker, but small changes in habit can go a long way in ensuring that the help is not tempted to the extent that he or she commits a crime, asserts police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 Apart from providing information about their help to the local police station, householders should never keep cash and jewellery lying around, say the cops. 

 Former police commissioner Nirupam Som says small families should stop being dependent on their domestic help. It is not advisable to keep whole-timers if you are staying alone with your spouse. Go for part-timers instead, he advises.

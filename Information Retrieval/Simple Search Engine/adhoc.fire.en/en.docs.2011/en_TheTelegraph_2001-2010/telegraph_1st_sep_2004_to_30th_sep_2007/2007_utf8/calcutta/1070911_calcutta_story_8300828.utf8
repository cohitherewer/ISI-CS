 Windows for visa rush

 The US consulate in Calcutta will improve facilities and increase staff to cater to the growing demand for visas.

 The workspace in the consulate will be doubled in the next 12 months and the number of interviewing windows will go up from three to 10. Three of the windows will be for American citizens, the rest will be for Indian visa applicants.

 Growing commercial ties and other exchanges, such as in education, have resulted in an explosion of demand for non-immigrant visas, said Peter G. Kaestner, the minister counsellor for consular affairs, US Embassy.

 In 2006, 357,792 non-immigrant visas were issued in India, of which 21,000 were issued in Calcutta. This year, the number of visas issued from Calcutta is expected to cross 27,000.

 The consulate has expanded the waiting area in 2006 and built a wheelchair ramp this year. The number of employees will also go up. We added a new consular officer position in Calcutta last year and have added three new administrative positions to speed up the processing of cases, said Kaestner.

 According to projections, there will be four more consular officers in Calcutta by 2011. We will be receiving a new officer in 2008 to help with visa investigation to expedite the processing of more complex cases, said Henry V. Jardine, the US consul general in Calcutta.

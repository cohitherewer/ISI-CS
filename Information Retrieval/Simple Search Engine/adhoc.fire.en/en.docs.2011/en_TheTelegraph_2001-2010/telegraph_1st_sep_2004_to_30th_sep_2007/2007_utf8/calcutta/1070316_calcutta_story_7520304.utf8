 Hip hop happening

 A trio of hip hop rappers from Senegal, West Africa, Daara J plays a brand of music that blends African traditions with American influences, combined with mellowness, warmth and a critical eye. Their music picks up a taste of rumba here (Esperanza) a dash of ragga there (Exodus), slipping a Spanish guitar into several tracks and firing off words like a machine gun (Bopp sa Bopp) or laying back as break-your-heart crooners. Their production is impeccable, their arrangements distinctive and their lyrics meaningful, while their rhythm drives forward with a steady pulse that has made them unquestionably one of the most popular voices of contemporary Sene-rap. Invited by French Embassy in India, Daara J (featuring singers Lamine Mamadou Seck, Abdou Fatha Seck and Elhadji Mansour Jacques Sagna and DJ Sonny Sorenser) is touring throughout the Alliances Franaises network, and is performing live this evening for the first time in the city. Hosted by French Embassy in India and French Association, The Park Hotel and Open Doors.

 Event: Live performance by Senegalese music band Daara J When: Today at 9 pm Where: Tantra, Park Hotel

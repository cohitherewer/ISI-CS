The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Say bye to bags on flight to Dubai 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 G.S. Ahluwalia (name changed), a businessman from New Alipore, went on a holiday to Europe. But in a few days, he had to rush back to the city because his father suddenly fell ill. 

 Ahluwalia landed in Calcutta airport, but his luggage was missing. Even after a written complaint with the airline, Emirates could not get him back his baggage after four days.

 Ahluwalia and his wife had gone to Spain via Athens on May 14 on a leisure trip, when he received the message that his father was suffering from multiple organ failure.

 We took an Emirates flight from Gatwick airport in London to Calcutta via Dubai on May 25, he said.

 My wife, being an asthma patient, has to carry nebulisers and other emergency medicine. Due to security reasons, we were not allowed to carry a big bag into the cabin. So, we stored the medicines in the registered luggage, he said. 

 At Dubai airport, Ahluwalia went up to the Emirates authorities to reassure himself that his baggage had been loaded. 

 After a quick check, the officials there assured me that the baggage was in place. But when we reached Calcutta, my luggage was missing, Ahluwalia alleged. 

 He added that seven other passengers on the same flight had also lost their baggage. 

 Following complaints from the passengers, the airport manager of Emirates promised that the luggage would be tracked within two hours. 

 But in the next four days, the Ahluwalias didnt get their baggage back. The airline officials made several calls to Ahluwalia, assuring him that his bags would be returned. But they could not trace the baggage.

 At first, they told us that the bags could not be traced. Finally, on Monday, they said the baggage had been found. But they delivered just one of the two bags we had lost, he alleged. 

 Another city businessman (name withheld) faced a similar situation. 

 In February, he had gone to Dubai but his baggage didnt reach the airport from Calcutta. After running from pillar to post at the airport for over two hours, he lodged a complaint (DXBEK-60411) with the officials. 

 Emirates delivered a bag to my hotel room on the same day. But it was not mine. I had to go to Manchester without my bags, he said. 

 The airline officials promised to send my luggage by the next flight on the same day. But it never happened, he added.

 I was forced to buy a full set of clothes, pullovers and other utilities in Manchester, he alleged. The passenger has demanded compensation but is yet to receive any from the airline. 

 Emirates officials were not available for comment.

 CU schedule recast not before 2008

 MITA MUKHERJEE

A University Grants Commission (UGC) directive has forced Calcutta University (CU) to recast its academic calendar, to the benefit of thousands of students who seek admission in other states every year. 

 The UGC on February 26 had called for uniformity in academic schedules of colleges and universities across the country. It had ruled that the results of undergraduate and postgraduate examinations should be declared by the last week of June and academic sessions should begin by the first week of August.

 Currently, CU does not declare the result of even a single undergraduate or postgraduate examination by June-end. The results are sometimes declared as late as the following January. The university is not in a position to implement the directive from this year. It is expected to abide by it from 2008. 

 Delayed publication of results in comparison to universities in other states causes problems for students keen to take admission in institutes outside Bengal. 

 For example, a Presidency College candidate for B.Sc Part II last year had to run from pillar to post to obtain a provisional pass certificate by July-end for securing admission to a course conducted by All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. CU had conducted the examination in April-May and was not ready with the result till August.

 Institutes of higher education are opening new courses every year. Given the situation, we cannot restrict the choice of institution of the students to a city or state. They must be given the opportunity to pursue courses anywhere in the country. The UGC move will increase the mobility of students, said CU pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das.

 The Central Research Institute for Unani Medicine, where about 80 patients are treated every day, is being closed down and the building sold off.

 The institute, at 79B Chittaranjan Avenue, inaugurated in 1994, has been in bad shape for a long time the paint has peeled off, the sunshades are gone, the wires hang loose and parked vehicles block the entrance. The latest blow has been the transfer of two hakims, leaving only officer-in-charge Hakim Irshad Ahmed Khan to treat the patients.

 We have to wait for hours to be attended to, complained patient Amit Shaw. The women patients complained of the absence of female doctors. I feel awkward about consulting a male doctor, said a burkha-clad patient.

 To add to their woes, an advertisement was recently published in a language daily, seeking buyers for the institute building. Khan, however, said he didnt know about the advertisement, though it asks prospective buyers to send the quotations to the officer-in-charge.

 The State Council of Unani Medicine has a room in the building. Its director P.K. Mukherjee, said: I am not aware of the issue as the institute belongs to the central government. An official of the council, however, confirmed the sale. 

 The director of the Delhi-based Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, Md Khalid Siddiqui, said: We have no plans of selling the plot. On being asked why the council published the advertisement, he said: We were probing the possibility. 

 The patients are not ready to buy his explanation. We have petitioned the President, said patient Abhisek Sharma. Three years ago, the President had intervened when the institute had stopped supplying medicine to patients.

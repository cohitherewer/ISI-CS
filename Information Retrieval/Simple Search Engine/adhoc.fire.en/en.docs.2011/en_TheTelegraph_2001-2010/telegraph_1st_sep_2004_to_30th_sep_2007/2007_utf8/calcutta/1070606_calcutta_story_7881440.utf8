 Tech firm says it with flowers

 - IT company sets up R amp;D facility for petals amp; potatoes

 Gerberas in bloom at Vikdas Green House rsquo;s Arambagh facility 

Even as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee dreams of a thousand flowers blooming in the IT sector, a tech firm is sowing seeds to diversify in floriculture. Salt Lake-based hardware and networking solutions provider Micro Solus Systems announced entry into the flower market on Tuesday with the first bloom of its gerberas. Carnations will follow soon.

 I have long had a fascination for flowers. I looked up the Net and realised that a huge business opportunity lay in wait here, said Gautam Chatterjee, managing director of Micro Solus who has set up Vikdas Green House. The company is looking to start research in tissue culture to produce high-yield, disease-free varieties of flowers and vegetables, and set up a post-harvest management facility to increase the vase life of flowers.

 On Sunday, finance minister Asim Dasgupta will travel to Arambagh and lay the foundation stone for a Rs 1.25-crore tissue culture laboratory. Three poly greenhouses will also be inaugurated by ministers Naren Dey, Mohanta Chatterjee and Mortaza Hossain and MP Sudhanshu Sil there. 

 Another focus will be potatoes. In the last season itself, 20 per cent of the crop was lost to late blight disease. If we preserve microtubers in the laboratory and grow potatoes from them instead of potatoes from the year before, it will ensure a disease-free crop, explained Swapan Datta, senior botanist at Calcutta University who is acting as advisor to the project.

 The greenhouse, in which Rs 5 crore has already been invested in the first year, is growing 18,000 gerberas of 29 varieties. We are producing 2,000 flowers a day. Once we hike the daily output to 20,000, we can start exporting, said Vikdas CEO Manab Sengupta. He has been given a year to achieve this.

 Chatterjee is aware of the oddity of his diversification choice. Loke hashey amay dekhe, said the techie. But he knows how to marry his twin businesses. I will score in online trading, he said, sketching a floral future course.

 Sleep illness creeps up on young adults 

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

Purba Chowdhury was having a tough time with her 13-year-old son. A good student, he suddenly started faring poorly in class. He also became irritable and started throwing tantrums.

 When Purba could not take it any more, she took her son to a doctor, who diagnosed him with insomnia, resulting in sudden mood swings.

 According to city doctors, insomnia, a disease generally associated with grown-ups, is on the rise among 11 to 16-year-olds.

 Apurba Ghosh, director of Institute of Child Health (ICH), said: Insomnia among children is difficult to treat, as we dont prescribe sleeping pills. 

 Parents should look out for symptoms of insomnia among children (see box). If they persist for more than four weeks, the child should be taken to a doctor, opined child psychiatrist J.R. Ram.

 Insomnia in children is mostly caused by excessive stimulation through viewing of action films or cartoons, playing of violent computer games, consumption of food with additives, explained Ghosh.

 Ram stressed that parents should create for their wards an atmosphere conducive to sleep. 

 Children should have a fixed bed time. You cannot expect your child to sleep well if you and your spouse quarrel in the bedroom or have a party in the living room, he said. 

 Bedtime books also have a role to play. Avoid reading horror stories to your kids in bed, advised the ICH director.

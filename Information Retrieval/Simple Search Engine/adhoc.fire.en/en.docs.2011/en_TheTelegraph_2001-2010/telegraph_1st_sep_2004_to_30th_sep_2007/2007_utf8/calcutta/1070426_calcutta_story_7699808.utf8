 To pupils, with love

 Students of Saturday Activity

 Club of South Point perform at the programme at Madhusudan Mancha.

 It was a day for teachers to take some lessons on how to deal with and control difficult students. A seminar and an interactive session with teachers of The Heritage School was organised on April 10 on the school premises. Educational counsellor and psychologist Salony Priya conducted the seminar. 

 Classroom trouble is a common problem for teachers. This should never be treated as a battle with students, said Priya. She suggested that half the problem is solved if teachers do not try to identify individuals and punish them. Instead, they should involve the whole class in the lessons or in some activities and win their confidence. If this method can be successfully implemented, the rest of the class will eventually boycott the ones who make trouble. 

 Illustrating this point, Aroop Chaudhury, a teacher of environmental studies at the institution, shared his experience. When he started his career as a teacher, his students made life difficult for him. But he didnt give up. I created a junk corner in class, which had magazines and storybooks. I gave everyone the option of sitting at the junk corner if they did not want to do the class. The boy who used to make the most trouble took that bait, said Chaudhury. He then started an interactive session that would culminate in a play. Everyone except the boy got involved. He felt left out. It was after this class that he came up to me and apologised, the teacher said. 

 If the child gets no support from his friends, his need to belong forces him to rethink his stance and stay out of trouble, said Priya, who interspersed the session with clippings from the famous 60s film, To Sir, With Love.

 We try to identify such problems in our school and help the students through one-to-one interactions, said Meenakshi Atal, principal, The Heritage School.

 Victim of loan dupe duo

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A businessman has lodged a complaint of fraud against two young women who are already under arrest for duping another trader of Rs 25 lakh.

 Paramita Chakraborty, from south Calcutta, and Panchali Deb Burma, from Agartala, in Tripura, had allegedly posed as agents of a private bank and promised to procure a loan of Rs 2 crore for both businessmen. Paramita was arrested in Mumbai and Panchali in Agartala in the beginning of May.

 Bikash Biswas, a businessman of the Girish Park area, had alleged that the duo had showed him forged documents to prove that the bank they claimed to represent had sanctioned a loan of Rs 2 crore in his name. The women took Rs 25 lakh as commission.

 On Saturday, businessman Ajit Kumar Jindal lodged a complaint at Bowbazar police station, saying the two had duped him of Rs 21 lakh.

 Last month, 26-year-old Kuheli Chatterjee was arrested in Behala for allegedly duping a trader of Rs 2.6 lakh using the same modus operandi.

 It took Biswas more than a month to realise that he had been duped. When he contacted the bank officials, they told him that his name was not on the clients list, said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh.

 Paramita and Panchali approached Jindal, who has a business in Blackburn Lane, in central Calcutta, about six months ago. They said they knew the people in charge of the loan disbursement section of the bank. Jindal, who wanted a loan of Rs 2 crore, agreed to pay the women Rs 21 lakh, said an officer of Bowbazar police station.

 Jindal complained to the police when he did not receive a cheque from the bank. On inquiry, he found that all the documents shown to him were forged. The businessmen tried to call Paramita and Panchali, but their cellphones were not working.

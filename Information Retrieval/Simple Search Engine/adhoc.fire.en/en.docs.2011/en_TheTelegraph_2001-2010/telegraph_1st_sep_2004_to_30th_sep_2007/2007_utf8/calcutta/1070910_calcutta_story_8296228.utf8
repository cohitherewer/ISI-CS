The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Welcome to Metro, lend us a hand to keep doors closed 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The next time you take the Metro, dont stand anywhere near the door. It just might open during the ride. 

 On Sunday afternoon, Metro staff and passengers manually opened and kept shut at least four doors of a train as it travelled from Belgachhia to Park Street. 

 The doors started malfunctioning as the train from Dum Dum at 3pm was about to leave Belgachhia station. The driver could not shut all the doors despite repeated attempts owing to a glitch in the hydraulic system.

 After about 10 minutes, a Metro official named K.P. Bhattacharya ran down the length of the platform to detect the problem. Another official, R.N. Burman, joined him. He boarded a coach one of whose doors could not be shut. So, he tried to close it manually.

 At least three other doors in other coaches had the same problem. With not enough Metro staff to attend to all four doors, the passengers themselves tried to shut them.

 The train left for Shyambazar around 3.15pm with the doors forced shut. As the train gathered speed in the tunnel, the defective doors opened up. The passengers panicked and jostled with each other to move away from them.

 Burman held on to his door to keep it closed. I was standing near a door that would not close. The Metro official had shut it forcibly but it would not stay closed. It slid open with the train in motion. I lent Burman a helping hand to shut the door again, said Prasenjit Banerjee, a passenger who boarded the train at Dum Dum.

 In the other coaches, too, the passengers were keeping the malfunctioning doors closed.

 When the train reached Sovabazar, some of the doors did not open, preventing passengers from getting off and making those on the platform wonder what had gone wrong.

 The doors kept malfunctioning on the way to Girish Park, Mahatma Gandhi Road and Central stations. As the train approached Chandni Chowk, the door attended by Banerjee and Burman opened completely. The two hastily shut it.

 The glitch was finally fixed at Park Street station.

 Spokesperson for Metro Railway Pranab Dutta said: A glitch had caused the doors to malfunction and the train was delayed at Belgachhia for 10 minutes and at Park Street for five minutes. One train was cancelled as a result.

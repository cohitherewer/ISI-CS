 The state government is planning to make it mandatory for all autorickshaws in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area to run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to check the pollution level in the city.

 This was declared during a seminar on climate change held to commemorate World Environment Day. 

 The national-level seminar was organised by the state pollution control board, Indian Chamber of Commerce and Jadavpur University.

 Talks are on to push through the change. We are planning to hold a meeting with the transport department on June 14, said environment minister Sailen Sarkar. The government is also planning to bear part of the conversion cost to help autorickshaw-owners.

 Speaking on steps being taken to tackle threats to the environment, the minister said production, sale and use of plastic bags less than 40 micron in thickness will be banned.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: According to an international report, 23 countries will be affected by the rise in the sea level (due to global warming). India is on the list. The Sunderbans is stated to be under danger. But in the absence of adequate data, it is impossible to assess the situation. 

 The scientific fraternity should work to collect data on climatic change in the country, said Siddhartha Dutta, pro vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University. 

 We are planning to set up a climate cell which will look into the issues related to climatic changes, said environment secretary M.L. Meena.

 He added that the coastal regulation management plan would soon be prepared for the state.

 We Ask You Answer

 A sign of times

 Todays question: Should parents make teenaged children sign a bond guaranteeing old-age care?

 Tuhin Purkayastha,

 Parnasree Pally

 Though it is a tradition handed down from olden times that children would look after their parents in old age but this generation has changed it all. Yet I feel we should not force our young generation to look after parents. If parents feel uncomfortable they should move out to old homes to live in peace for the rest of their lives. Signing a bond will not guarantee them a secure future.

 How can parents make their children sign a bond for old-age security?

 Love and care for parents come spontaneously.

 Signing a bond will make it a compulsion. Children might feel that

 parents are a liability because they have signed a bond.

 It will

 be very

 unfortunate if the parents make their children sign a bond

 for their old-age security. The legal procedure will only

 widen the gap between generations. Old-age care is the right of parents

 which they should get without asking for it. Signing a bond can never

 be a solution if the will is missing.

 Nothing can be achieved by force. Then people will tend to break rules. Children should be taught that it is their responsibility to take care of their parents. Mutual love and understanding are the only ways to tackle this social problem. However, there is a law which makes it compulsory for children to take care of dependent parents. It can be a ray of hope for few as legal procedures are lengthy and confusing.

 To make children sign a bond seems cruel on developing young minds. In fact, it can even be detrimental. Imposing responsibilities in this way and at this age might prove detrimental for the normal blossoming of the relationship between with their parents.

 Parents shower unconditional love and care and invest money for their childrens education. After all this, if a child fails to understand that he needs to take care of his parents, nothing can be worse. Girls do take care of their parents despite opposition from their parents-in-law. Trust, faith and mutual understanding between parents and children should be nurtured from a young age. For example, if a kid sees his father ignoring his grandparents, then he will grow up with the same feeling.

 Parents can make their children sign bonds, but what if they dont abide by the rules and regulations? A law cannot inject feelings in children. Unconditional love and commitment are the key to solve such social problems. 

 Sachindranath Mitra,

 The problem is with our social structure. Children just dont care for their parents in their old age when they need them the most. Signing a bond is a childish plan.

Mou Das,

 That would be a bit too harsh on children. During these growing years they are constantly under pressure to prove themselves in all spheres be it studies, extra-curricular activities, in front of friends and peers.

 Return of the Russian

 - POLICE TO THE RESCUE

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A Russian videographer working for a city-based religious group could have been arrested for over-staying in the country, had not police come to his aid.

 Prostaz Zenon has alleged that the authorities of Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math, for which he was making promotional films, had turned him out after he asked for his remuneration.

 I needed at least $1,200 to get back home, but could not raise the amount. With my tourist visa lapsing on May 13, I was counting days for landing in custody, said Zenon.

 Before taking up the assignment, I was assured by the Moscow representative of the math, George Aistov, that I would be paid for the job. But I was not given a single penny. When I asked for money, they told me to leave the math, he added. The Russian consulate had allowed him to stay at Gorky Sadan.

 After failing to lodge a complaint with the local police station, apparently because he could not give the address of the Dum Dum Park math he was staying in, the Russian contacted Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 Acting on Kumars order, officer-in-charge of Lake Town police station Ranjit Chakrabarty summoned the math authorities and persuaded them to bear the expense of Zenons return home.

 The math has given an undertaking that it will take the responsibility of sending Zenon back to Russia, said Kumar. Aistov, now in town, said: The matter has been resolved. The trouble arose out of a lack of communication.

 Poetic paintings

 One of Indias more intriguing artists, Jatin Das creates visual poetry with unmatched passion and power. His imagery is, in his own words, metaphoric and not narrative and is filled with energy and rhythm. The precision of his single lines and the tonal quality of his art, along with the empty spaces between his lines, quietly, yet emphatically, suggest powerful movement. A body-observer, the artist approaches the human body as a space-manipulating, free entity. If experienced deeply, his forms make his paintings appear like silent, expressionist drama. Inspired by craft traditions of India and other lands, his art, nonetheless, is distinctive for its vigour, dynamism and intensity. A sensual being, a lover of poetry, music and fine cuisine, glimpses of his fondness for these can also be found in his artwork. Charged Figures, the ongoing exhibition of Das paintings, serves as an important catalyst for the reinterpretation of his works.

 lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by Jatin Das lWhen: Till March 17 (except Sundays amp; public holidays); 2 pm - 7 pm (Mondays, 3 pm - 7 pm) lWhere: CIMA Gallery, 43 Ashutosh Chowdhury Avenue

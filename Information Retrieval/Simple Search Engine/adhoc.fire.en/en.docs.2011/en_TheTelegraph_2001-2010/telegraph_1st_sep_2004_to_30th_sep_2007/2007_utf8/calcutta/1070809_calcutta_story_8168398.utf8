 The state government will try its best to look after the interests of the residents of Bow Barracks when the buildings are torn down for a makeover, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Wednesday.

 He was speaking after meeting a delegation of the representatives of all seven blocks of Bow Barracks at Writers Buildings in the afternoon. Barry OBrien, the MLA representing Anglo-Indians, accompanied the residents.

 The new estate, to be called Bow Barracks Enclave, will comprise three residential towers (each six storeys high), a community hall and an open space that can be used as a playground and for hosting functions. 

 The residents will be provided temporary shelter till the new buildings are ready, said Bhattacharya.

 The Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) had declared the buildings unsafe in 1980 and stopped collecting rent, but the Bow Barracks residents had opposed any attempt at a makeover.

 The present renovation plan, however, has been endorsed by 111 of the 131 families living in the Barracks, the minister said. 

 Most of the families, OBrien pointed out, are Anglo-Indians, while there are a few Muslim, Chinese and Gujarati families, too.

 The government wants to hand over the dilapidated buildings to a private developer, who will build the new estate. Of the 83 cottahs on the Barracks premises, the buildings and other facilities will come up on 43 cottahs. The rest will be handed over to the private partner. We will soon float expressions of interest to select a developer who can give us the best deal, Bhattacharya said.

 The private partner is expected to build a commercial estate on the 40 acres, for which the CIT is expecting some money.

 The residents will be offered one, two or three-roomed apartments at a price much less than the construction cost, the minister said. We do not want to give them free-hold rights to ensure they do not sell the flats to outsiders. That will ruin the character of the place.

 We are planning a childrens park on the premises and a permanent stage where festivities like Christmas can be held, said OBrien.

 Utmost care should be taken to retain the old-world charm of the Barracks when they are rebuilt, recreating the wide verandahs overlooking the cemented playground, he added.

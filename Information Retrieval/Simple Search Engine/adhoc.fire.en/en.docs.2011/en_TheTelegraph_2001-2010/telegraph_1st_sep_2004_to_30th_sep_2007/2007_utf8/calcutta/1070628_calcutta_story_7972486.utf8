 Swap of students

 - Exchange scheme with Turkish schools

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Student exchange programmes will no longer be restricted to management institutions. Schools in the city, too, will soon be able to reap the benefits from student exchanges with other countries.

 The Indo-Turkish Business Association is set to begin a 15-day student exchange programme to promote cultural relations between the two countries.

 India and Turkey have so many things in common. We share a lot in terms of culture and language. And we thought it was time for more interaction, said Imran Zaki, member of the association.

 Exchange of students has started on a smaller scale. Some students of Learnium School which is run by the Indo-Turkish Friendship Society and has a student strength of 300 have already been to Turkey. The positive response from students and teachers led to the decision of expanding the scope of exchange.

 Our students have spent a month in Turkey and attended schools there. Now, we plan to invite students from Turkey to India, said Cetin Akaya, education in-charge, Indo-Turkish Business Association in Calcutta.

 The exchange will be primarily cultural with Indian students staying with Turkish families and vice versa. Staying with the families will give the students a first-hand experience of the two cultures. They will be visiting the local historical sites and museums and travel around the country, said Zaki.

 The programme will tentatively begin in October, to coincide with the Puja holidays. Fifty students, between Class VIII and Class XII, from schools across the city will be selected to participate in the programme. Schools like La Martiniere for Boys, St James, Birla High, St Augustine, St Thomas and St Josephs have already shown interest. Schools that have been identified in Turkey are Feith High School in Istanbul and Safron School in Karabuk.

 The students participating in the exchange programme will have to pay around Rs 50,000 for the programme, which includes airfare. Food and stay are free. The association will also help students to find sponsorship to cover the expenses, said Zaki.

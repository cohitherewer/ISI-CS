 Woes aplenty at library 

 - Shortage of staff and pilferage plague book address

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 A premier seat of knowledge is mired in a slew of problems. 

 Administrative apathy and pilferage are keeping readers away from books at the National Library.

 A Group-B gazetted officer of the library was recently punished for carrying rare manuscripts out of the premises for personal use.

 This is only the tip of the iceberg. The biggest problem the library is facing is shortage of manpower. For years, there has been no recruitment, resulting in more than 250 posts lying vacant.

 The Group C and Group D staff deal with the readers. Scarcity of staff at this level directly affects the readers. Most books do not reach the racks. Even if they do, there is no Group D staff to guide the readers, explained Saibal Chakraborty, secretary of the National Library Staff Association.

 Library director Sudhendu Mondol stated: After joining as director, I have managed to fill up more than 25 posts. But I admit that some posts are lying vacant. I have written to the ministry concerned regarding this.

 Bhasha Bhavan, the two-year-old annexe of the library that houses over three million rare books, manuscripts, maps, periodicals and other precious documents, was under ankle-deep water after heavy rains in 2005 and 2006.

 The building was erected at a cost of Rs 100 crore, as the old library building is not ideal for storing and preserving rare books.

 After the 2005 waterlogging in Bhasha Bhavan, Rs 20 lakh was sanctioned for repairs. But the problem recurred the following year.

 Even three years after the commissioning of Bhasha Bhavan, thousands of books are lying in the old building because of lack of adequate staff to process the books and transfer them to the new wing.

 In November 2005, a library assistant and information officer (microphotography) was caught by security guards on his way out of the premises with manuscripts. He was showcaused by Mondol.

 A two-member committee was set up to investigate the matter. After the charges against the officer were established, the director punished him on March 1 this year.

 We found the officer guilty of the charges. He will not be entitled to any increment from 2003 to 2011. This has been done to set a precedent, so that others do indulge in such activities, said Mondol. 

 An institution as large as the National Library is bound to have some problems, but the readers should not be inconvenienced as a result of the problems, said Sanjay Mukherjee, head of the political science department of Scottish Church College and a regular at the library.

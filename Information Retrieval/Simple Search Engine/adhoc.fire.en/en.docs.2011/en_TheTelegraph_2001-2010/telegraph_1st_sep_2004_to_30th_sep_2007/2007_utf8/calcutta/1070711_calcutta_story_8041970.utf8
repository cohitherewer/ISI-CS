 - Interaction with educators on development of curriculum

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A group of 16 educators and administrators from elementary, middle and secondary schools in the US, on a month-long tour of India, will interact with their counterparts in the city from Wednesday to Sunday.

 The team will try to drawing upon these meetings to develop an effective curriculum and prepare a model for its implementation in classrooms in the US.

 Under the aegis of the Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad Program, groups of teachers from the US have been visiting India for 20 years. In 2006, the theme was Broadening the knowledge base on India.

 During its stay in the city, the team, comprising teachers from institutions like John Marshall Elementary School, Virginia, and International School of the Americas, San Antonio, Texas, will participate in a panel discussion on Curriculum development in high schools at the American Center on Wednesday.

 The city representatives at the seminar will include English, social sciences, science and mathematics teachers of city schools, including Modern High School for Girls principal Devi Kar, science teacher at the school Rajeshwari Dey, and a teacher of English at St Johns Diocesan School for Girls, Subhalakshmi Nandi.

 The US team will also meet others associated with education in Calcutta. The list includes students and teachers of Jagadish Bose National Talent Search Programme, The Heritage School and Sishu Bikash Academy, a minority institution on the south-eastern fringes.

 The delegation wants to visit every kind of academic institution in Calcutta for a comprehensive idea about the education scenario, said an American Center representative. The US panel will also visit Birla Industrial and Technological Museum.

 The interaction of our students and teachers with the US team will be mutually beneficial, said The Heritage School principal David Rao.

 He added that under a Fulbright Scholarship Program last year, Brad Lewondosky, a chemistry teacher from Hawaii, had come to teach at The Heritage School for six months, while Basabi Ghosh, a biology teacher at the Calcutta school, went to Hawaii to teach there. 

 The US delegation is in India since June 29. In Delhi, its first stop, the team met education board representatives and curriculum planners of NCERT. The team then left for Varanasi, from where they will reach Calcutta by train. The team will also visit Chennai, Kochi and Mumbai.

 Return of AIDS patient

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nitai Adhikary, an AIDS patient, was readmitted to Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday, a day after he was allegedly thrown out for refusing to bribe a ward-boy.

 He was put on oxygen and drip immediately after being admitted to the male medicine ward around 5.30pm.

 His condition is critical. We are ensuring the best possible treatment for him, said Medical College superintendent Anup Roy.

 A probe has been ordered to find out those who denied the 32-year-old goldsmith admission in hospital.

 Adhikary, a resident of Ghatal in West Midnapore, was brought to the hospital on Tuesday morning with respiratory distress and other ailments. 

 After the resident medical officer admitted him on the floor, a one-armed ward boy told his relatives he could arrange a bed for Rs 200. The family refused to pay, after which the ward boy and his colleagues allegedly threw him out. He was then admitted to Arunima Hospice, in Behala.

 The medical college superintendent asked us to take him back to the hospital, said Gautam Roy of the Hospice.

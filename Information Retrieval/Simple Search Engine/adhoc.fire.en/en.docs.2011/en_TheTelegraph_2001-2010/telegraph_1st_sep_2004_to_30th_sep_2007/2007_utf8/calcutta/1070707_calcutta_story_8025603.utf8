 Fresh test of CU Tuesday paper

 - Of the 7 who made it to the exam centre,two fainted, one was injured

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University (CU) will organise a fresh examination of Paper V of English MA (Part II), which was held on Tuesday, when most of Calcutta went under water.

 The test the date for which will be announced later is being held mainly for those who failed to turn up on Tuesday, but students who managed to write the exam can also sit for it.

 The university has postponed all exams since Wednesday, and so have other institutes.

 Considering the immense trouble faced by the examinees on July 3, we have decided to organise a fresh test, said Onkarsadhan Adhikari, the controller of examinations of the university. 

 Those who could not reach the university on Tuesday can take the fresh examination, which will also be open to those who wrote Tuesdays test, he added.

 Adhikari said the authorities could not postpone the examination, as the rain had started the previous night and there was hardly any time to take a decision.

 Of the 253 examinees, seven could make it to the College Street campus. Of the rest, two girls fainted on reaching the university after wading in chest-deep water on College Street. Both were rushed to a nursing home by the university authorities.

 Officials said another girl turned hysterical and showed signs of a nervous breakdown, while a boy suffered severe injuries after falling into a pothole on a waterlogged road. The two sat for the test but had to leave without completing it.

 Several students arrived late and most were drenched and not in a position to sit through the four-hour exam.

 The situation prompted guardians to write to the university authorities, requesting them to hold a fresh test.

 We have never come across such a situation. It was raining heavily and the area around the campus was submerged. The students were shivering, recalled an official.

 The examination was supposed to start at 11am, but as most students turned up late, it was deferred till 1.15pm, he added.

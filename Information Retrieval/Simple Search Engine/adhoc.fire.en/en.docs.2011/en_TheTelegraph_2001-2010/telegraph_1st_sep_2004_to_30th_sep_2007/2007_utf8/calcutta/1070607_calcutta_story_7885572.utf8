 Civic tax act to be amended

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The property tax valuation act is likely to be amended after a Supreme Court rap on Bidhannagar Municipality for not giving property-owners a chance to challenge the valuation rate.

 The amendment will create scope for a public hearing before the final list of valuation is published. The provision existed in the West Bengal Valuation Act, 1978. Rule 10 of the act made it mandatory for municipalities to put up a draft valuation list outside their office.

 The court struck down the Amendment Act, 1994, for the absence of Rule 10. Under the act, property-owners are invited for a review by a four-member committee after publication of the final valuation list. The committee is controlled by the municipality concerned and the valuation board.

 The 1994 amendment was to cut costs and the need for manpower, said Tapas Dasgupta, member-secretary of the state valuation board. 

 The new amendment will take at least five months to implement. The municipalities might not be able to collect tax before that. Bidhannagar Municipality has last week asked for financial aid from the state government.

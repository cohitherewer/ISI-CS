 Murder trail leads to jail, lifer held 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A prisoner serving life sentence was arrested in a solitary cell at Dum Dum Central jail on charges of masterminding the murder of Biju Roy, an employee of Somani Realtors, last month.

 Kausar Ali, alias Dukhuya, was arrested early on Sunday and produced in Bidhannagar court. 

 Dukhuya wanted to retain control over the real estate market in the Dum Dum-Lake Town belt. He commissioned three hired killers to eliminate Biju, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 Police are still probing the motive behind the February 19 murder, in which three unidentified gunmen fired at Biju from point-blank range at a construction site in Dakshindari.

 The involvement of Dukhuya serving life sentence in connection with a March 2003 murder in Dum Dum in the killing became clear after Vicky and Md. Shahid were arrested.

 Interrogation of the duo revealed that Dukhuya had planned the murder and then called the hired killers to jail. They met him as visitors, said an officer of Lake Town police station.

 According to him, Dukhuya is actively involved in planning extortion and other illegal activities in Dum Dum, Lake Town and Dakshindari.

 Dukhuya and Pandit used to run the show in these areas. Though both are behind bars, they have people to carry out orders, added the officer.

 The question is how Dukhuya can communicate with his men. Police have not reported recovery of any communication device from his cell, but surveillance in jails had always been suspect.

 We are aware that seasoned criminals hatch plots from inside the jails We are trying to counter that by boosting surveillance and keeping a close watch on their activities, said a senior jail officer.

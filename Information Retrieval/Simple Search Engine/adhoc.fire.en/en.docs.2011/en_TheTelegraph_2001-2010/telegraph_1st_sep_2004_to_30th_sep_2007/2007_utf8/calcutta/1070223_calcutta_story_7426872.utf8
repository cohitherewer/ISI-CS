 Singapore had been home to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose for several months during World War II, when he led the Indian National Armys campaign against the British. 

 He frequented various places in the city state and was friends with a number of families, with whom he often exchanged letters.

 All these and other details of Boses stay in Singapore will now be the subject of research, to be conducted by Calcuttas Netaji Institute for Asian Studies, at the behest of the government of that country.

 The foreign ministry of Singapore had approached chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to get an institute to carry out research on Netajis stay there.

 The institute agreed to involved itself in the project following an assurance from the chief minister at a meeting at Writers Buildings on Wednesday that the state government would extend all possible help, including funds, to it.

 Netajis Singapore connection has a historical significance and the chief minister wants it to be researched extensively, said Suranjan Das, honorary director of the state-controlled Netaji Institute of Asian Studies.

 The chief minister is chairman of the institutes general council.

 The research will be held jointly by the institute and the Singapore government, Das added.

 Giving an outline of the project, Das said: We will take photographs of the sites that were frequented by Netaji and interview the residents whose families were close to him. 

 The researcher will also try to locate Netajis manuscripts in Singapore. All our findings will be compiled for preservation, said Das.

 Preparations for the project started a few months ago, after the chief ministers office conveyed the Singapore governments request to the institute.

 The chief minister has also advised the institute to carry out research on the economic relations between India and China.

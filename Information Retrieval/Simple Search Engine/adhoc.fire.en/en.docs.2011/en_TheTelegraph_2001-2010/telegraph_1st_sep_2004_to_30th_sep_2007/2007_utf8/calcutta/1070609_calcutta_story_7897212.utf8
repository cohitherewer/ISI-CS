The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Menace and his nemesis

 Meet Vicky

 For years, Kaneet Vicky Bhatia has been a menace at the Lakes. A habitual harasser of women, the 27-year-old had been detained by police more than once for drinking and smoking ganja there.

 Vicky, son of a businessman and an arts graduate, got married in 2001 and is the father of a three-year-old daughter. He lives with his family in Hiland Park, off the EM Bypass.

 Eve-teasing apart, he has been known to drive recklessly while drunk. He was booked for rash driving by officers of Lake police station a few days ago. He got bail, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 In April, Vicky was picked up after he hurled abuses at policemen while speeding in front of Lake police station. He later alleged that the police had tortured him during his detention. His allegation was proved false, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 On Thursday night, he told the police that he had forced a motorcycle rider to lick his shoes and beg for forgiveness after a collision between their two-wheelers on Southern Avenue.

 Vicky is a menace in and around the Lakes. He enters the Lakes late in the afternoon with his accomplices and starts drinking. By evening, they start creating trouble. He has been picked up several times and let off with a warning, in the absence of witnesses willing to press charges against him, said Kumar.

 Meet Rina Gupta and Pramila Dutta

 Vicky met his nemesis in Pramila Dutta, who runs a tea-stall near the Lakes. She witnessed Thursday nights incident from the molestation of the girl to the thrashing of reserve force constables Tamajit Som and Sanjib Jha.

 The girl who was molested refused to lodge a complaint, but Pramila gave us a blow-by-blow account and even agreed to lodge a complaint, said Kumar.

 I saw how a person can behave like a beast. Vicky pounced on the woman and beat up her boyfriend... I frequently see him creating trouble in the area, said Pramila, who testified against Vicky and his three accomplices.

 Pramila was supported by Rina Gupta, who was sitting at the tea-stall when the assault took place. Rinas witness account matched Pramilas and proved beyond doubt that Vicky was the villain.

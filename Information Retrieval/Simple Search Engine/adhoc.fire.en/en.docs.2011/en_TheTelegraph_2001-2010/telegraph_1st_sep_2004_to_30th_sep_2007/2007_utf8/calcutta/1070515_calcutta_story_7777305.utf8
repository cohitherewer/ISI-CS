Eight men were arrested in connection with a brawl between two groups of security guards in the Camac Street area on Sunday evening. 

 The fight started at 22 Camac Street during a promotional event attended by Bollywood star Suniel Shetty. All the eight belong to the agency that provided guards for the programme. They had created nuisance on the premises of a prominent club in the area. 

 Four security guards of the club had tried to enter the makeshift hall at the shopping address where the event was being held, but the security personnel there did not allow them in, said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee.

 A scuffle broke out. The four club guards fled when they found themselves outnumbered. The other group of guards chased them, said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 The four took shelter inside the club. The guards who were chasing them also entered the club. A fight broke out between the two groups of security personnel. Sensing trouble, the club authorities called the police, said Chatterjee.

 The police found the eight guards employed by the programme organisers inside the club. They were immediately arrested.

 Those who organised the promotional event alleged that the security guards of the club had pelted stones and damaged the window panes of the hall. We did not find evidence of such damage at the venue, said an investigating officer.

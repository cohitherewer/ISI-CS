The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Brick load in phone crates

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two crates, out of a consignment of nine, supposed to be loaded with cellphones, were found filled with bricks at Netaji Subash Chandra Bose International Airport on Monday.

 The consignment arrived at the airport from Bangkok around 4am on Saturday by a Thai Airways flight.

 Customs and airport officials are trying to find out if the theft had occurred in Bangkok or Calcutta. We have to find out where the theft was committed, said an official.

 Neither has any FIR been lodged nor anyone arrested. Some ground-handling employees of Air-India have been detained for questioning.

 Airport sources said the officials visited the cargo department of the airport to study the cargo movement.

 The ground-handling staff took the crates for inspection from the cargo hold area around 8.30pm on Saturday, after they found the seals of two of the crates broken.

 They immediately informed the customs officials and a probe was launched. Officials suspect that the seals were broken in Calcutta.

 Ground-handling employees were held responsible for some recent thefts from passengers baggage. Laptops, cellphones, cash, cameras and cosmetics have been stolen in the past few months.

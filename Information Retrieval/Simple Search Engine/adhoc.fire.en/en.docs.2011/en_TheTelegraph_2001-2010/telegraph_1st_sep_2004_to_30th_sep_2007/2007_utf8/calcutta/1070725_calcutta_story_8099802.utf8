 Cop who knows every criminal

 - 45-year-old has been preparing profiles of lawbreakers for 21 years

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 He knows every dreaded criminal in the city by face, has interacted with them and is even familiar with their background. But this cop will never try to catch one of them. 

 Meet Sujit Bhattacharjee, the additional officer-in-charge of the criminal records section of Calcutta polices detective department. He has been taking photographs of arrested criminals, preparing their profiles and sending them to National Crime Records Bureau for 21 years. 

 Bhattacharjee also prepares the crime data that is tabled before the chief minister in the Assembly during question hour. 

 For more than two decades, I have interacted with hundreds of criminals from murderers and dacoits to pickpockets. Preparing their profile is a rigorous job and we have to do it carefully, since the entire force depends on us, says the 45-year-old man, who lives in Liluah with his wife and son. 

 Bhattacharjees job has earned him recognition among those on the wrong side of law. As he boarded a bus near Howrah station recently, three youths jumped off it. The conductor asked me if I was a policeman. When I said I was, he told me that the three were pickpockets and were scared to see me, recalls Bhattacharjee, who plays cricket in his locality in his spare time.

 It is difficult to remember all the criminals I have interacted with. But they remember me. They salute me when they see me on the street. At times, it is an embarrassment, specially when I am with my family. 

 According to the police rules, criminals have to be taken to the criminal records section after their arrest for clicking their photographs and preparing their profiles. The information is later uploaded on computers. 

 After clicking the pictures, I interact with the criminals to find out their backgrounds and how they took up crime. Some of them lie and even refuse to be photographed. But I will never forget a criminal named Rashid Khan, who narrated his lifes story in detail, says Bhattacharjee. 

 He joined the force in 1986 as a sub-inspector after mandatory training of six months. His first posting was at the crime records section and he has been there since. 

 He explains how the wing helps in the detection of crime. A criminal recently snatched a gold chain from a Mohun Bagan club officials relative. We showed him photographs of criminals operating in the area where the snatching had taken place. He identified one of them. We informed the local police station and the snatcher was soon arrested. 

 According to the officer, the crime trend has changed over the past two decades. There is more white-collar crime now. Also, law-breakers from neighbouring states commit crimes here and flee. 

 Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner (I) of the detective department, was all praise for Bhattacharjee. He is the longest serving officer in the criminal records section, which is a very important department. He is very efficient, he says.

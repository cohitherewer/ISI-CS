 Rosa Maria Riera was flying home to Barcelona days after undergoing a cosmetic facial surgery in Bangkok. But while having dinner on board, the knot in her main facial artery came off, resulting in uncontrolled bleeding from the mouth.

 As the condition of the 30-year-old Spanish national fast deteriorated, the pilot of the Swiss Air flight had to make an unscheduled landing at Calcutta airport early on Wednesday. Riera was rushed to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, where a repair surgery later, she is waiting to be flown home.

 An exporter of cosmetics, Riera had been staying in Bangkok for the past six months for business reasons. In the second week of March, she underwent the cosmetic surgery at a clinic in Bangkok.

 She bled once after being released from the clinic and had to be admitted to the emergency ward of a hospital, but recovered soon. The doctors even granted her wish to fly to Spain.

 She took the Swiss Air flight to Barcelona, via Zurich, on Tuesday night. As I have been asked to eat only semi-solid food, the airline gave me spaghetti for dinner. While eating, my mouth was filled with a salty fluid. I spat and to my horror, it was blood, recalled Riera on Friday, sitting on her hospital bed.

 The other passengers screamed and the crew rushed to me. I was taken to the rear of the aircraft, where they asked me to lie down. I closed my mouth but blood was oozing from the nose. I felt helpless and scared, she said.

 Following a suggestion from an on-board doctor that immediate medical intervention be arranged for Riera, the pilot contacted Calcutta airport and made an unscheduled landing at 2.40 am on Wednesday. An official of Lufthansa Airline (which has a tie-up with Swiss Air) accompanied her to the hospital.

 The main facial artery was cut and ligated after the surgery. But the thread came off, causing the bleeding, said Srijon Mukherjee, consultant maxillo-facial surgeon at Apollo Gleneagles, who was part of the team that carried out the repair surgery on Wednesday. 

 When a main artery bleeds, it can be life-threatening, he added. The surgeons later re-ligated the artery with a double-knot. Hospital sources said Riera would be discharged on Saturday. I will fly to Mumbai and from there to Barcelona, said the Spaniard.

 An advanced paediatric unit, a nurses training centre, a diagnostic centre and an auditorium are among the several facilities set to come up at Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan next month.

 The facilities will be housed in a seven-storeyed building on the hospitals Sarat Bose Road premises. Adhish Sinha Memorial Building will be commissioned on July 24 as part of the inauguration of the year-long platinum jubilee celebrations of the hospital.

 The new building and the units have cost Rs 10 crore.

 Critical paediatric surgeries will be performed in the unit, which is equipped with all state-of-the-art gadgets, said hospital secretary Swami Sarvalokananda. The 50-bed unit, spread across the second and third floors of the new building, houses surgical, orthopaedic, ENT and medicine departments.

 The new unit is in addition to the existing 70-bed paediatric unit of the hospital.

 There is also a neo-natal intensive care unit, with ventilators, warmers and other facilities.

 The ground floor of the building will have an emergency ward and a waiting hall for relatives of the patients. A diagnostic centre and a cafeteria will take up the first floor.

 The fourth and fifth floors of the building will house Ma Sarada College of Nursing and School, which is set to be extended. 

 The nursing college and College of Physiotherapy, also run by the hospital, are affiliated to West Bengal University of Health Sciences.

 The nursing college will have 25 seats and the school, 50. The college runs a four-year undergraduate degree course and the school offers a three-year diploma curriculum.

 A London-based NRI has donated two bighas in Kankurgachi to the hospital, where another unit of the college and a hostel will be set up. Work is scheduled to start after Durga puja 2007, said Swami Sarvalokananda.

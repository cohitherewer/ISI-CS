 Open house for higher notes

 Calcuttan of the Week

 Name: Barna Maitra

 Address: 11H Jheel Road, Jadavpur 

 Is proud owner of: A music hall on the top floor of her four-storey house. It looks like a mini-library, but is actually a music lovers paradise. There are more than 10,0000 LPs, CDs and cassettes stacked in a wooden cupboard on one side of the room. The collection dates back to 1902, the year that marks the beginning of recorded music in India. LPs of Satyakimkar Bandyopadhyay, Gopeshwar Bandopadhyaya, Dagar Bandhu and the entire range of the renowned Bengali courtesans khayals and thumris occupy pride of place. 

 Walk in: Here Barna, a frail woman in her early 50s and her husband Rantideb, director, Engineering Export Promotion Council, keep open house. Anyone can walk in, choose a CD and have it played. 

 Sounds too good: But this only hides a deeper purpose. Barna is an activist, advocating the cause of dhrupad, which she fears is gradually moving towards extinction.

 Whats dhrupad? Its one of the oldest forms of Hindustani classical music that doesnt allow too much improvisation. The text is usually an ode to divine powers and royalty. 

 Whats she doing about it? Barna and Rantideb, who is posted in New Delhi, set up an organisation called Dhrupadi in 1995. It now has nearly 25 members. Not all of them are singers. Our objective is to sustain and revive dhrupad because it is a difficult form of music, says Barna, a singer, who switched from light music to dhrupad after her husband introduced her to it. 

 The movement: The couple has tried to revive the Shankar Utsav that stopped more than 50 years ago. The three-day long festival started afresh at the famous Basu Mallick house in 2000. The Maitras also started The Jadubhatta Utsav held every June since 2004. Both are dhrupad revival festivals, adds Barna, who has initiated her daughter into the form. Barna has trained under dhrupad exponent Satyakimkar Bandyopadhyay. The couple organises a Dhrupadi Sondhya once every month. 

 Extra curricular: At other times Barna is rearranging an impressive collection of antiques and paintings. I try my hand on the keyboard sometimes, says Barna, pointing at an old organ in the drawing room.

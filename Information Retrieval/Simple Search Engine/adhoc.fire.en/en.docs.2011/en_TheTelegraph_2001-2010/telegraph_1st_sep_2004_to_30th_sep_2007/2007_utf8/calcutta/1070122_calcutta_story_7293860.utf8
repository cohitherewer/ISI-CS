 Avani 

 Heights, promoted by Avani Group.

 59A Chowringhee Road, oppo site Calcutta Club, next to 

 Exide House.

 The mall sprawls over 30,000 sq ft. The G+12 property has 

 three-level retail racks.

 The soft launch on January 14 has already 

 attracted serious shoppers. There are hardly 

 any walk-ins or window shoppers.

 No advertising, no publicity but footfalls are rising by 

 the hour. 

 The cash registers are ringing loud, proving that price 

 point is no longer a concern for Calcutta. 

 There is ample basement parking facility.

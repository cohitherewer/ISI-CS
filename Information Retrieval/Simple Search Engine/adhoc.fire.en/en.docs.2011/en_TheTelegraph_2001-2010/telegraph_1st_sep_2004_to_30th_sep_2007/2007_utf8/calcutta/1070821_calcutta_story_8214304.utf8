 Art and liberation

 The hegemonic hold over the Indian psyche has continued for several decades after Indias independence. All projects of the changing human situation in India, both in the colonial and post-colonial eras, have been influenced by the over-arching existential reality of Western domination and its effects. In the arena of art and culture, this has been in the form of the conflicts between traditional and modern, local and global, bourgeois and democratic. The ongoing show, Freedom: What it means to me, presents an interesting survey of the extent to which the desire for freedom or a feeling of its denial still motivates painters and sculptors of generations born since August 15, 1947. Participating artists include Aditya Basak, Barun Chowdhury, Chhatrapati Dutta, Debraj Goswami (a painting by him appears right), Farhad Hussain, Jayanta Roy, Kanchan Dasgupta, Manjari Chakraborty, Pappu Bardhan, Rima Kundu and Tapas Biswas. Curator: Pranab Ranjan Ray.

 Event: An exhibition of visual objects by well-known artists When: Till August 22; 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Aakriti Art Gallery, 12/3A Hungerford Street, 1st floor

Biswanath Mondal had long suspected wife Anita of having an affair with his friend Gora Chand Mondal. His doubts were brushed aside by the duo, but Biswanath had to pay with his life for daring to object to the affair.

 The 33-year-old resident of Bishnupur, on the southern fringes of the city, was killed on Kali puja night (October 21) allegedly by Gora Chand and one of his friends. 

 The skeletal remains of the body were recovered from a septic tank near a resort in Joka early on Tuesday.

 Gora Chand and his friend have been arrested in connection with the murder, while Anita has been detained for interrogation. 

 The wife might have been having an illicit relationship with Gora Chand, but there is no proof yet of her active involvement in the murder, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).

 The skeleton has been sent for forensic test.

 Biswanath, who used to run a furniture shop, lived with his wife and two minor sons. His parents live separately.

 Police said Gora Chand, who frequented Biswanaths house, developed an intimate relationship with Anita. Biswanath objected to the affair, but Gora Chand ignored him.

 Gora Chand reportedly told police during interrogation that he, Biswanath and Dinanath (one of his friends) had a drinking session on Kali puja night in Joka. Soon, a quarrel broke out between Biswanath and the duo over the alleged affair. 

 Gora Chand and Dinanath then assaulted Biswanath, who slumped to the ground and died. The duo dragged the body to a farmyard nearby and dumped it in the septic tank.

 Two days later, Biswanaths father, Haradhan, visited his sons house. Anita told him that Biswanath had gone to Bangalore on urgent work. Gora Chand told me not to worry, as he was looking after my daughter-in-law and the grandchildren, Haradhan recalled.

 I became suspicious as my son was not returning. On Friday last, when I visited Bis-wanaths house, I found Anita and Gora Chand in a compromising position. I did not wait a minute and headed straight for Bishnupur police station, said Haradhan. 

 A team picked up Gora Chand from his residence. He admitted to the crime during interrogation. My sons body was recovered after that, Haradhan added.

 Trio held for hawker slay

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Three youths were arrested on Thursday evening on charges of murdering 26-year-old Raju Prasad, the hawker who had stood up against a gang drinking in the open near his house in Gol Park.

 All three Vishak Dey, Abhijit Sadhukhan and Subhasis Dasgupta are former students of a college off Gol Park. Another accused is absconding.

 Police said Subhasis, a resident of Nepal Bhattacharya First Lane, in Tollygunge, had passed out of the college in 2004. Vishak and Abhijit passed out in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Vishak, now doing his MBA, is from Kalighat, while Abhijit lives in Tollygunge.

 The trio was rounded up from Tollygunge Circular Road and booked under sections 304A (death due to rash and negligent act) and 34 (common intention). The three will be produced in court on Friday.

 Police said one of them was arrested by Muchipara police a year ago on charges of rioting and hurling bombs.

 Late on March 21, Raju was on his way back home on Gariahat Road when he spotted a gang of youths drinking near a teashop on the pavement.

 Not used to turning a blind eye to wrongdoing, Raju dared to tick off the youths, said a family member of the hawker, who earned a living selling vests at Gariahat.

 Enraged, the youths caught hold of Raju and started assaulting him indiscriminately to teach him a lesson. On being informed by some local residents, Rajus mother Sandhya rushed to the spot and saw the youths hitting her son on the chest and also trying to throttle him.

 Family members and friends brought Raju back, with the assailants in tow. They kept the hawker confined to his home for the next 36 hours and threatened the family with dire consequences if a move was made to hospitalise him or contact police.

 On March 22 morning, the youths even offered the family Rs 100 to meet Rajus medical expenses. Two days later, Raju started sinking and died after being taken to National Medical College and Hospital.

 As news of the death spread and local residents went berserk, a team from Lake thana swung into action, based on a complaint by Rajus father Murali Manohar Prasad.

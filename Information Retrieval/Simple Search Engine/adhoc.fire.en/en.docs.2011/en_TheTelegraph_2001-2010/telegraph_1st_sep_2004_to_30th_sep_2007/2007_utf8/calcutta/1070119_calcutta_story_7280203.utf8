 Kin hand in Behala killing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A family feud could have led to the murder of Behala jeweller Ramen Saha, alias Hartal. 

 Police are looking for his brother Khokon, who lives in Naihati, for his alleged role in the killing.

 Ramens body was found behind MR Bangur Hospital, in the Regent Park area, on Wednesday. He had been missing since Sunday afternoon. A post-mortem report confirmed that the jeweller had been strangled with his tie.

 Superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta said Khokon had been arrested earlier for duping people. The relationship between the brothers had soured over the shop in Behala, which Ramen used to run. It is a family property and Khokon was probably eyeing it, he explained.

 Police are also on the lookout for others who might have been involved in the murder. It isnt clear who made mysterious calls to the jewellers house after he went missing.

 We are investigating why the family members did not inform police when Ramen did not return home on Monday and even after they received calls from people who did not identify themselves, stated superintendent Gupta.

 Ramens wife Sabita said the calls had been made from a public call office in Kudghat. On Wednesday, one of the callers asked us to go to MR Bangur Hospital to identify my husbands body. My elder daughter Ratri had taken the call, claimed Sabita.

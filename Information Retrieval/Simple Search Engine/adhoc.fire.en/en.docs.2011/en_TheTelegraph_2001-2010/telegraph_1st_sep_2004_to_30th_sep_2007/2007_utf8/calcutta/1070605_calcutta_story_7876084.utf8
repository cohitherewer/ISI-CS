 Five held for shop rob bid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five youths were arrested on Monday in Howrah in connection with the Saturday night robbery at two jewellery-manufacturing units in Shibpur Bazaar. Two pistols and a revolver were seized from them

 On Saturday night, an armed gang of four walked into two jewellery units in Shibpur Bazaar and tried to rob the shops at gunpoint. Sadhan Roy, owner of one of the shops, fought back and caught hold of one of the robbers, Chottu Roy. The rest fled.

 After interrogating Roy, Anil Thakur, Bikash Singh and Prasanta Debnath were arrested from a house in Rameswar Malia Lane on Monday. Shibsankar Debnath and Prasenjit Debnath were rounded from Baksara.

 Superintendent of Howrah police Niraj Kumar Singh said: Shibsankar and Prasenjit worked in a jewellery shop at Batore. Last year, they had robbed a jewellery shop. The gang was also involved in hijacking a truck last year.

 A hunt is on track down the owner of the house in Rameswar Malia Lane, where the gang took shelter after the robbery, Singh added.

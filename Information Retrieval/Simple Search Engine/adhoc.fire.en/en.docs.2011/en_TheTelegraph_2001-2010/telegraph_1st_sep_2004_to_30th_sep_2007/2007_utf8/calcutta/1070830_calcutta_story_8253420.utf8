 Bombs slipped into court

 - Undertrial irked by delay would have hurled explosives at judge

 A STAFF REPORTER

Judicial delay allegedly drove an undertrial to desperation as he smuggled two bombs on to the court premises on Wednesday, with the intention of hurling them at the judge.

 Ataur Rahman was arrested two years ago in connection with a murder case, but is yet to be convicted.

 The undertrial, lodged in Dum Dum Central jail, was brought to Barrackpore court around 11am, along with some other prisoners, in a police van.

 Before being taken to the court lock-up, police ran a check on all prisoners. When Rahman was being frisked, something lumpy was found around his waist.

 When asked what it was, Rahman said it was his lunch wrapped in a plastic bag.

 The policemen took out the bag and found two crude bombs inside.

 How he had managed to smuggle the bombs into the jail and then bring them to the court in the police van remains a mystery, said the additional superintendent of police, Basab Dasgupta.

 The police then combed the court premises and found another crude bomb in one corner of the lock-up.

 Rahman later confessed that he had brought the bombs to hurl at the judge to protest his continued incarceration.

 He said that for more than two years, the case had been dragging on but the judge was yet to pronounce his verdict, an officer said.

 Rahman claimed it was unfair that he should be locked up in jail as he was innocent. He said it was his anger at the injustice of it all that made him bring the bombs to court, the officer added.

 Till late on Wednesday, Rahman had not told the police how he had managed to get the two bombs. The police suspect that someone handed them to him when he was in the police van.

 Sometimes, relatives pass on food to the prisoners while they are in the van by bribing the constables on guard duty, an officer said. In this case, it is possible that instead of a food parcel, someone may have handed him those bombs.

 The police are also not ruling out the possibility that someone may have armed him with the bombs in jail.

 A year ago, a prisoner had escaped from Dum Dum Central jail by placing a ladder against the wall and clambering over.

 But how the third bomb made its way to the court lock-up is something the cops are clueless about.

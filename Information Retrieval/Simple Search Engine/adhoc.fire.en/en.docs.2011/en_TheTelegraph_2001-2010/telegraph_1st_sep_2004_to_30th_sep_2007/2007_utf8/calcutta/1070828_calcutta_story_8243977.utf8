 Book fair sends army third plea for Maidan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Publishers and Booksellers Guild has shot off a third letter to the army, seeking permission to organise Book Fair 2008 on the Maidan.

 Its first plea was rejected by Fort William, while the second letter, seeking any site on the Maidan for the annual event, has met with silence.

 After moving their fresh plea on Monday, Guild officials met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who reportedly advised them not to lose heart. The high court this year had ordered the fair out of the the citys lungs on environmental grounds.

 The third letter has sought permission in the same manner as was granted for Calcutta Festival, Baazi Bazar and Lexpo to be held on the Maidan.

 If the army, the custodian of the greens, still refuses to grant us permission, we will conclude that it is practising double standards, said Tridib Chatterjee, the general secretary of the Guild.

 The Guild officials said the Maidan is their first preference, followed by Shahid Minar, Park Circus Maidan, Rabindra Sarobar stadium and the Milan Mela, off the Bypass (in that order).

 We have to hold the fair between January 30 and February 10. We will discuss the options with our members and try to reach a consensus. We want to hold the fair at a site accessible to all, said Chatterjee, ruling out the Salt Lake stadium, this years venue.

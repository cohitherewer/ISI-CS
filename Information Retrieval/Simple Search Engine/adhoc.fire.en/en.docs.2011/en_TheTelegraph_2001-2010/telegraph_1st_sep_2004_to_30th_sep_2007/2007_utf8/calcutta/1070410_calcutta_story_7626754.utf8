 Delhi referee in cable row

 OUR BUREAU

 The Centre will decide on a dispute between multi-system operator (MSO) Shristi and the Zee Turner group over the telecast of its channels, declared the state government on Monday. 

 The Zee bouquet of channels is not available on Shristi, which operates in Behala. The first phase of the conditional access system (CAS) has been implemented in the area. 

 The MSO wrote to state information and cultural affairs secretary Dilip Chakraborty, alleging that Zee is not allowing Shristi to beam the channels to favour its own MSO, Siti Cable.

 City head of Zee Turner Jayanta Das said: Our engineers checked Shristis control room recently and reported technical problems. We will go through their report and visit the control room again to find out whether the MSO has been able to meet the technical standard needed to receive our signals. Otherwise, we have nothing against the MSO.

 A state government official said: Shristi has mentioned in the letter that the broadcasters partisan attitude has resulted in viewers switching over to Siti Cable.

 After a meeting with broadcasters at Writers Buildings on Monday, Chakraborty said: We will notify the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and the information and broadcasting ministry about the matter, as we are not empowered to take any action.

 According to industry sources, Shristi had brought the matter to the notice of Trai officials during a meeting on April 5 to discuss the launch of next two phases of CAS in the city. 

 It was at the behest of the Trai officials that the MSO has forwarded its complaint through the state government. Unless the issue is resolved, the launch of CAS Phase II in the city, scheduled in August, could be delayed, said a source.

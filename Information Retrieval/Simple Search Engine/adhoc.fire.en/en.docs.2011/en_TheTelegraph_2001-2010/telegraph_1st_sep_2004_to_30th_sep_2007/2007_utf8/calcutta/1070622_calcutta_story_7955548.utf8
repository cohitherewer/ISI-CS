 Court asks for scripts

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Examinations will have to produce the answer scripts of a Behala student who failed in both physics and chemistry for two consecutive years, ruled Calcutta High Court on Thursday.

 The student, Avijit Kumar Mondal, has ranked 891 on the 2007 Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) engineering list and 37 on the medical list, both in the Scheduled Castes category.

 Avijit has scored above-average marks in JEE and its hard to believe he failed in the Higher Secondary examinations, said his lawyer, Ganesh Banerjee. 

 The examinee has been a victim of faulty evaluation by the Higher Secondary council, Banerjee alleged.

 Ruling on the petition moved by Avijit, Justice B. Sommadder ordered the council to produce the answer scripts before the court on June 28. The judge directed Mahestala High School, where Avijit wrote his examination in 2006 and 2007, to submit the answer scripts of Avijits practical papers.

 A student of the science stream, physics, chemistry and biology were Avijits compulsory subjects, while mathematics was his optional paper.

 In 2006, he had scored 40 and 42 in chemistry and physics theory papers, respectively, and failed.

 This year, he got only 29 and 38 in chemistry and physics, respectively, despite having done well in the JEE, said Banerjee.

 The lawyer appearing for the council argued that Avijit should have approached the council for post-publication scrutiny of those two papers, instead of coming to court.

 Subrata Mukhopaddhay, junior standing counsel, who appeared for the JEE board, opined that all doubts would be cleared once the answer scripts were brought before the court.

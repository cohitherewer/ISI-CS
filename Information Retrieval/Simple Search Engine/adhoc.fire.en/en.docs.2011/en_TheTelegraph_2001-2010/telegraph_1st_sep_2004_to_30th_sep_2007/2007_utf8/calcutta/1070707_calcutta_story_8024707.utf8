 Conduits fox engineers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic authorities are clueless about what caused the severe waterlogging on Camac Street following Tuesdays downpour. They had hoped waterlogging on this stretch would be much less this monsoon, as the drainage conduit under AJC Bose Road had been desilted.

 Around 13,000 metric tonnes of silt was scooped out of the underground sewer before the monsoon, yet the conduit could not drain out water from Camac Street and Park Street. Some engineers suspect the sewer got choked after the clean-up.

 The situation in Alipore was the same as in previous years, as the main conduit the desilted sewer under Judges Court Road was full of water from neighbouring Kidderpore.

 Civic officials claimed that waterlogging was minimal in other areas where drainage revamp work has been taken up, such as Syed Amir Ali Avenue, APC Road, CIT Road, Lenin Sarani and Rashbehari Avenue (from Lake Market to Gariahat flyover).

 They also claimed that waterlogging could not affect most arteries, as they have been given a coat of mastic asphalt. Only those topped with bitumen have been damaged.

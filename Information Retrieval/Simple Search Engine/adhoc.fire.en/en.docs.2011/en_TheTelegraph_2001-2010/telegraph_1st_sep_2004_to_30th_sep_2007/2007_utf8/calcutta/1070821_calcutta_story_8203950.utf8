 Funds to upgrade JU water facility

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur University (JU) has set a target other than achieving academic excellence. It will soon undertake a project to provide safe drinking water to students and employees.

 The UGC has decided to sanction Rs 3.45 crore to JU for upgrading the infrastructure of 23 science and engineering departments. The money is to be spent by March 2008.

 According to UGC conditions, the university will have to spend a considerable part of the funds on upgrading drinking water facilities on campus. 

 Among the schemes the UGC has forwarded to the university, augmenting drinking water supply is one.

 Modernisation of the laboratories and upgrade of the library (through digitisation) are the other projects the university will take up with the UGC funds.

 As advised by the UGC, we have decided to improve the infrastructure of our science and engineering departments. Upgrading drinking water supply facilities is a key area, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the universitys executive council.

 A letter from the UGC asking the university to submit proposals for upgrading the departments has reached the Jadavpur campus last week.

 Officials said this is the first time the UGC is providing a special assistance grant for the upgrade of the infrastructure of individual departments. Each of the 23 departments will get around Rs 15 lakh.

 The departments have been asked to prepare reports suggesting ways to utilise the funds. Based on the inputs, the university will prepare a comprehensive report to be sent to the UGC. 

 The report has to be submitted by August 20.

 Officials said some of the departments that have already received UGCs special assistance funds for other purposes have been excluded in this round.

 The facility upgrade funds of the UGC is offered to high-performing universities across the country.

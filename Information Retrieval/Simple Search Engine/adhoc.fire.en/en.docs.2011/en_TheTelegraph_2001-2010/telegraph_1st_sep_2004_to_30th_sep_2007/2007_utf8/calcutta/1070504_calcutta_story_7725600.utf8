 Green fuel-maker shunned

 - CNG-FROM-COWDUNG PROJECT GOES TO NAGPUR

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 An innovation that might have eased the growing demand for clean vehicular fuel has left the city for Nagpur. 

 In the absence of serious takers for their new device, that eases the production of compressed natural gas (CNG) from cowdung, city-based project initiator J. Chaturvedi and the German scientist associated with the project, T.U. Stephani, have decided to transfer their technology to a Nagpur-based company that had floated commercials earlier this month.

 We had earlier worked on many projects to produce energy from bio-degradable matter. We conducted a successful project on the preparation of coal from biodegradable municipal waste. But lack of support made us decide on finding takers outside the state, said Chaturvedi.

 To make the availability of CNG cheaper, the duo has developed a new type of digester, where the gas is fermented to produce biogas rich in methane.

 The traditional 250-cubic-metre digester costs between Rs 12 and Rs 17 lakh. But the digester we have developed costs less than half the amount, even when were using some imported parts, said Chaturvedi. 

 The innovators tied up with P. Brahmachari of Uttar Pradesh, who had developed the technology for bottling the methane gas, and together floated a pilot project. 

 While we were tired of looking for prospective funders here, a private group from Nagpur contacted us and we decided to start commercial production with them, said Brahmachari, from Nagpur, over the phone.

 According to Chaturvedi, the traditional method of generating CNG from cowdung has had some difficulties, as it had to be produced and put to use instantaneously, which restricted its use. 

 The main problem in converting biogas into CNG is the removal of impurities, like carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide from the gaseous mixture. This process is very complicated. But weve edged towards a solution, said Stephani.

 Dry ice and eco-friendly manure, known as vermi-compost, can also be produced from the generated residue, that can further lessen the price of the gas.

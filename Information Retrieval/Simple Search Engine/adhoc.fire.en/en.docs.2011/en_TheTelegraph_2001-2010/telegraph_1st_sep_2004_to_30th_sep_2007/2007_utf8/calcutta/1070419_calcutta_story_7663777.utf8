The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Spurt in cellphone swipe

 JULIUS GOMES

 The number of cellphone theft cases in the city is keeping pace with the growth in the mobile phone market.

 With the number of cellphone connections in the Calcutta circle nearing the 3.5 million mark, the number of cellphone theft complaints is rising.

 People call us up to block their numbers after they lose their cellphones Earlier, we used to receive 10-12 calls a day, but now on an average we receive 50 to 60 such calls a day, said the spokesperson for a leading service provider.

 Though most of the thefts or losses go unreported, according to data available with Calcutta Police, 300 such complaints are lodged every month with 48 police stations in the city. 

 The watch section of the detective department also receives around 60 to 75 complaints every month. 

 The number of complaints has increased, but the recovery rate is only around 10 to 15 per cent.

 According to cellphone manufacturers, the recovery rate should be much higher as all the cellphones have unique international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) numbers.

 In case of a theft, the police can contact service providers and check if the particular handset is in use. It is not difficult to zero in on the thief, said Rana Debnath, GSM service in-charge, Simoco.

 When the user switches on the handset, an SMS with the IMEI number is automatically sent to the service provider requesting network connectivity. So tracking it is not difficult, added Debnath. 

 But the cops pass the buck for low recovery to complainants. The complainants are unable to provide necessary information like the unique IMEI number, which is crucial for investigation and recovery, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department). 

 Failure to provide the unique 15-digit IMEI number can be linked to ignorance about the number.

 A lot of people do not know about the IMEI number, which is stored in the handsets Normally, we tell our customers to preserve the number, said employee of a Nokia shop. 

 But preserving the IMEI number is not enough to ensure recovery of cellphones, as the cops treat these complains lightly. 

 For instance, when Arnab Sarkar, a college student residing on Gardner Lane, went to Taltola police station to report his cellphone theft, the duty officer asked him to lodge a general diary instead of a first information report.

 I could file an FIR only after I approached higher-ups, said Sarkar, who provided all the details to the investigating officers. More than three months have passed, but Sarkars cellphone has not yet been recovered.

 The violence in Kidderpore following the death of Shakil Ahmed Khan, secretary of Vijay Market, in a road accident on Sunday was politically motivated, claimed a senior IPS officer.

 Local politicians had instigated the mob, resulting in the police-public clash. We have got the names of the people who were behind the violence and they will be arrested soon, the officer said. 

 Local Congress leaders exploited the frayed tempers following the death. They even raised the Nandigram issue to incite the mob. Unaware of their motive, the mob went berserk and attacked policemen, including deputy commissioner (port) Rajiv Mishra, he added. The violence was pre-planned. Some of the politicians led the mob from the front.

 Tension was palpable in the neighbourhood even on Tuesday. Hundreds of people had gathered in front of Shakil Ahmeds house, near Five Star Market, since morning, waiting for his body to arrive from the mortuary.

 Later, around 10,000 people took out a funeral procession amidst tight security to Sola Ana burial ground to perform the last rites.

 A large police contingent, led by special additional commissioner Kuldiep Singh and joint commissioner (armed police) Zulfikar Hasan, took control of the area. 

 Around 300 policemen were deployed in the neighbourhood. Pickets were also posted in the lanes to keep the situation under control. The day, however, passed off peacefully, said Singh.

 Recalling Sunday nights events, an officer said: A large number of people had ransacked the emergency ward of SSKM Hospital and took out Shakils body. They headed for Watgunge police station and spread rumours that police had forcibly taken the body from them. This resulted in the violence.

 Outnumbered by the mob, the cops remained mute spectators to the torching of buses and the assault on firemen.

 Deputy commissioner Mishra said: The situation spun out of control as the mob went on the rampage. It was sheer madness. 

 A probe has been ordered and those who were behind the violence will be exposed soon, he added.

 Another senior officer said the situation was similar to that of the 1984 lynching of a deputy commissioner. The port area has always been notorious. Politicians there instigate uneducated people against policemen.

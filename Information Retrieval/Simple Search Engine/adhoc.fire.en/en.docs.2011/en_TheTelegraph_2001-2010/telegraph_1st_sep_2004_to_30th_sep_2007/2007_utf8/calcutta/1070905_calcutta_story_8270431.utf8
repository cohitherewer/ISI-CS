 Funds hitch in transplant 

 SANJAY MONDAL

 On stage, Indra Lahiry had donated blood to save his daughters life two decades back. In real life, the jatra actor wants to donate his kidney to save his daughter but does not have the funds for the transplant. 

 The Lahirys of Dum Dum Park have a college-going son named Shouvik and a school-going daughter named Shruti, who is scheduled to appear for higher secondary next year. The 17-year-old student of Krishnapur Adarsh Vidyalaya suffers from a congenital renal problem. It was detected five years back when she underwent an ultrasonography.

 Shrutis parents took her to Muljhi Bhai Kidney Hospital in Gujarat for surgery. Her condition improved after the operation and she was well for all these years, said Lahiry. The problems resurfaced recently after the creatinine level in her blood shot up. 

 Shruti was again taken to the Gujarat hospital, where doctors said that kidney transplant was a must to save her life. Her father offered to donate one of his kidneys. 

 Because of logistic problems, the transplant could not be done there, said Lahiry. He contacted doctors at a private kidney institute in Calcutta. They also told him that renal transplant was the only way to save the girls life. 

 Her kidneys had become weak by the time the surgery was performed. So its effect wore off. Now the girl is suffering from severe renal failure and transplant is the best option, said Arup Ratan Dutta, a city-based nephrologist. 

 The family was given an estimate of Rs 5.24 lakh for transplant and post-transplant treatment over approximately a year. It is a huge amount for us and we have no idea how to get the money. Income from jatra is seasonal. And these days, my income has gone down, said Lahiry, the only earning member of the family. 

 The family has been able to raise about Rs 2 lakh. They have written to the chief minister and the Prime Minister seeking help but have not received a response.

 Even if the funds are arranged for the transplant, the familys problems will not be solved. After donating his kidney, Indra will find it difficult to perform all types of roles. Doctors told me that I would have to lead a restricted life after donating my kidney. They said I could continue acting, but only in roles that have less action, said Lahiry.

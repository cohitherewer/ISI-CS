 Lawn for the mayors men 

 - Chaplin Park will cover road in front of civic HQ

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters may soon have a lawn, in the form of Chaplin Park.

 The civic authorities are planning to draw the park closer to the municipality main office by digging up the road in between. The road connects Grant Street with Market Street.

 Bringing the park closer will be a value addition for the century-old heritage structure. Civic engineers are examining the proposal. I have to discuss the matter with my mayoral council members before taking the decision, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, civic engineers and officials inspected the area earlier this week and found that the proposal will not be difficult to implement.

 It does not mean that motorists will be deprived of a carriageway. An equally wide road will be constructed on the southern side of the park, said Bandyopadhyay. 

 If the plan is implemented, civic officials will have to park their cars on the southern side of the park and walk through it to the main gate of the CMC headquarters.

 The park and the building used to be part of the same property. Bringing them together will help carve space to park cars. More parking space will be required once Chaplin cinema is turned into a shopping mall.

 The park will also act as a buffer between the mall and the civic office. The civic authorities are also enthused by the fact that bringing the park closer will keep the building main gate free of agitators and squatters.

 To take advantage of the extra space, there is also a proposal to construct an automated parking plaza for about 200 cars. Chairman and managing director of Simplex Projects B.K. Mundra has already inspected the site and expressed interest in the project.

 To make the parking plaza cost-effective, we will have to keep only four feet of it above the ground, said Mundra.

 There is already an underground parking lot on Lindsay Street, on the southern side of New Market.

 Bitter-sweet flavours of life

 Pulitzer Prize-winning American screenwriter Frank D Gilroy, who began his career with television, gained wider fame writing plays for Broadway and later, directing his own scripts for Hollywood productions. This evening, Stagecraft presents A Slice of Life, a quartet of his short plays for mature audiences. The Next Contestant is about the tremendous emotional ordeal a young man endures simply to win a challenge in a TV reality show. Come Next Tuesday depicts the apparently ordinary domestic life of a middle-aged couple, only to shock its audience with a bizarre twist at the end. Match Point, a story of a pair of highly-respectable, happily-married couples, is a sexual comedy with a dash of sardonic, sinister humour, that turns conventional expressions of middle-class morality on its head. A satire that explores and explodes the truth of professional success, Give The Bishop My Faint Regards comes with another truly great ending. Direction: Rohit Pombra.

 lEvent: A quartet of short plays by Frank D Gilroy, produced by Stagecraft lWhen: Today at 7.30 pm lWhere: Starmark, 3 Lord Sinha Road

 CMC gets traffic warning

 - Waterlogging on Buddhas route to work

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city traffic department has set a pre-monsoon deadline for the civic authorities to tackle the problem of waterlogging on a road most frequented by the chief minister on his way to office and back.

 Workers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had taken over two hours to pump out knee-deep water from Syed Amir Ali Avenue on Tuesday last, following a rainfall of 47.5 mm, while chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy made its way to Writers Building.

 The convoy usually takes that road on way to office and back. This year, we have not yet faced problems of waterlogging. But we had to take another route last year because of waterlogging on Syed Amir Ali Avenue after a heavy shower, said A.K. Maliwal, officer on special duty (OSD), chief ministers security.

 But the traffic department has decided not to take chances this year. Many VIPs, too, use Syed Amir Ali Avenue and every year, waterlogging becomes a major source of concern for us. Even the residents of the area go through a bad time whenever there is a heavy shower. This time, we have asked the CMC to quickly tackle the problem, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Javed Shamim.

 However, according to CMC officials, the problem started after last years concretisation of tram tracks on the road.

 Water travels through a two-ft-nine-inch-diameter brick sewer under Syed Amir Ali Avenue, which reaches the Ballygunge pumping station after travelling under Park Circus and AJC Bose Road. 

 The waterlogging problem began only after the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners went through with the concretisation of tram tracks. During construction, portions of concrete slabs, cement and stone chips fell into the brick sewer and blocked it, said Farzana Choudhury, mayoral council member (sewerage and drainage).

 Civic engineers have already inspected the area where the brick sewer has been clogged but the traffic police are yet to give us permission to start work, she said.

 SMS girl denied bail, to appeal

 OUR BUREAU

Denied bail and remanded in judicial custody till March 26, Mehak Ahuja cried out in court: I am not a terrorist. Why are they not letting me go?

 Her parents broke down while the additional chief judicial magistrate, Barrackpore, was reading out the verdict. This is the most unfortunate incident to have happened to us. My daughters academic career will be ruined, said father Maninder. 

 He will move the high court on Thursday against the Barrackpore courts order.

 Mehak, 25, a second-year MBA student at a Delhi-based institute, was arrested on the night of March 11 at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport. She had sent an SMS to her father after boarding a Calcutta-Delhi IndiGo flight earlier in the evening, stating that there were terrorists on board. 

 Her father panicked and promptly called the airline and the airport authorities.

 The flight was called back, but Mehak failed to identify any terrorist. She was taken into custody on charges of violating civil aviation safety norms. During interrogation, she told police that some youths were passing comments at her and later she overheard their conversation on doing something on the plane.

 Mahek was brought to the court lock-up from Barrackpore sub-divisional jail around 2 pm. Will I be imprisoned for 10 years? she asked an officer standing nearby.

 The parents were too shocked to react after magistrate Gopal Chandra Karmakar turned down the bail plea. It was left to the relatives to console Mehak.

 Officers of the district police said they had produced the case diary in court. 

 A strong case has been prepared, as her act could have led to major safety hazards, said an officer. Besides, it caused harassment to all passengers on the flight.

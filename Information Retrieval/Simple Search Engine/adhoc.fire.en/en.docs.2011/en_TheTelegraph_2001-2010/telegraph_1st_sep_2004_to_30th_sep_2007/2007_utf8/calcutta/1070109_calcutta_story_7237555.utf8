 Helen Mirren in The 

 Queen

 This years crop of British films is the strongest in years. And clearly British films and talent will play a major part in the upcoming awards season. These are two undeniable conclusions to be drawn from the Golden Globe nominations, with the awards to be given out next Monday. (You can catch the 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards live on STAR World on Tuesday from 6.30 am with a prime time broadcast at 8 pm.)

 Children

 In a strong year for female performances, three of the five nominees for best actress in a film drama are British Judi Dench, playing a manipulative schoolmistress in Notes on a Scandal, Helen Mirren as the reigning monarch in The Queen and Kate Winslet as an adulterous American wife in Little Children.

 The Queen, which looks likely to spearhead Britains Oscar quest, picked up three nominations and made its presence felt at the Globes. Yet Sacha Baron Cohens Borat a wild-card film if ever there was one cannot be ruled out, given that Cohen and his comedy took a nomination apiece.

 Peter OTooles nomination for portraying an elderly, washed-up actor in Venus feels like an attempt to compensate this remarkable actor for past oversights on awards nights. Or maybe its just that British films are the flavour of the season. Surprisingly, Chiwetel Ejiofor was recognised by the Globes for playing a drag queen in Kinky Boots a British film from last year that was not a contender for any major awards.

 The Globes flatter themselves as reliable indicators of Oscar voting. In truth, they are curious awards, voted on by 86 Hollywood-based entertainment journalists, who contribute to non-American media. The Globes reflect lighter, more populist taste than other awards, and its members favour old-fashioned Hollywood glamour.

 They honour both film and TV, dividing all awards between drama and comedy or musical. Bizarre results can ensue this year Renee Zellweger is nominated for playing Beatrix Potter in the British comedy or musical Miss Potter, which strictly speaking is neither.

 Still, Britains Emily Blunt should be delighted with her nomination as Meryl Streeps secretary in The Devil Wears Prada. Streep, it almost goes without saying, is nominated, too. Tellingly, a lead performance in another British film was also honoured American actor Forest Whitaker, as dictator Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland.

 The hospital in Bishnupur under construction

 Bharat Sevashram Sangha is setting up a multi-speciality hospital in Bishnupur, on the southern fringes of the city, where treatment will be within the reach of the underprivileged.

 If work proceeds according to schedule, the hospital will be thrown open to the public in March next year. We are working hard to finish the project in time, said Swami Brahmatmananda, the chief coordinator of the Sangha.

 Surrounded by greenery, the 500-bed hospital spread across six floors and on seven acres will have all modern facilities. 

 There will be an emergency ward, an outpatients department, a polyclinic, a speciality clinic for medicine, a gynaecology wing, an ENT section, a diagnostic centre and a surgery department.

 There will also be an operating theatre for minor surgeries, a 10-bed daycare centre, facilities for ICCU, ITU and MRI, and a blood bank. The hospital will enroll specialists from various fields, said a Sangha official.

 All our gadgets will be indigenous. The hospital will be readied in phases and the entire project will cost Rs 150 crore, said the chief coordinator.

 There will be quarters for doctors on the premises so they could be contacted by patients or their families round-the-clock. There will also be provisions for technicians, paramedical staff and nurses to stay in the compound. We dont want patients families to face any inconvenience after admission, said the monk.

 While fixing the charges of various facilities, the authorities will ensure that they are within the reach of the underprivileged section. At the same time, there will be no compromise with the quality of treatment. Our motto is to provide the best treatment at an affordable rate, he added.

 At the various health centres run by the Sangha, the consultation fees vary from Rs 2 to Rs 5.

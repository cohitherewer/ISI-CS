 With Valentines Day just a couple of weeks away, love is not just in the air, its on your TV screens too. Sonys English movie channel PIX brings an amazing line-up of great stories all through February to satisfy your love for movies.

 And its not just about those mushy romantic films from the West; the month begins with the intense The End of the Affair (in picture), starring Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes as lovers whose affair ends one fine day without any explained reason. To find out what went wrong, watch the Neil Jordan film on Thursday at 10 pm. 

 Having got you in the mood for love, PIX follows it up with Everytime We Say Goodbye on Saturday, at 10 pm. Tom Hanks plays an American flyer who finds himself in Jerusalem, falling in love with a Jewish girl. So, start February with two great love stories before you inch closer towards the V-evening.

In the UK, the box-office grosses up to Sunday exceeded that of Krrish and Guru as well as Rang De Basanti and Don for the same period.

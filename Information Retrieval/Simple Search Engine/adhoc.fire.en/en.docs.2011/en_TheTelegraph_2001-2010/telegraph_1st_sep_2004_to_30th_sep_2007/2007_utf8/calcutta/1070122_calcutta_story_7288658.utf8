The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week 

 without ...

 Watching SRK on KBC 

 Will lock kiya jaye feature as much in 

 the third edition? Will he be wishing his viewers shabba 

 khaer? Will he be more friendly or less friendly? 

 KBC anticipation (Big B vs King Khan) at last turns 

 to action. At 9 pm on Monday on STAR Plus, the great Indian 

 television gets bigger and maybe better. After all, Shah 

 Rukh Khan is set to take the hot seat, to be the dost 

 (friend), not the host. As for the game, the magic 

 remains the same Rs 2 crore, four lifelines, 15 questions 

 and four options. Are you in it?

 Celebrating Republic Day 

 Ooh Dont we all love these Friday holidays! (Specially 

 when they arent forced upon us by Bengals bandh 

 culture). 

 Wake up, rise, shine and salute 

 your country. After the National Anthem and flag hoisting, 

 make use of the winter sun and plan an eventful day outdoors.

 Leave home with a yummy picnic 

 basket, some games, sunscreen and a pair of sunglasses. 

 And yes, dont forget to wear the colours of patriotism 

 over the weekend.

 Wooing Ma Saraswati

 Its goodbye to books on January 23 and without a 

 trace of guilt. Its time to go desi, decking up Ma 

 Saraswatis idol, with alpana all around and 

 the entire puja process. Time to please the goddess of knowledge 

 (remember your upcoming final exams or promotion-time?) 

 and impress her with your single-minded focus on the anjali 

 session. Bite into that first kul of the season. 

 Also, pick some petals to sprinkle on your books, for good 

 luck all year. The dress code is also desi for the day 

 yellow saris for her and kurta-pyjama for him. All in an 

 effort to impress the mother goddess and maybe your boy/girl 

 friend with a dress rehearsal for Valentines Day, 

 if you please!

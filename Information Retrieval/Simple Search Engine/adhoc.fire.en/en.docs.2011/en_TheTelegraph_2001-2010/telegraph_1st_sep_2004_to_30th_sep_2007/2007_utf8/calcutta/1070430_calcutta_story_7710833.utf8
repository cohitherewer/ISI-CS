 A city consumer court has fined Haldiram Bhujiawala Rs 1 lakh for selling spoiled, spurious and unhygienic snacks. The judgment was passed last week on a complaint filed by two brothers, who suffered food poisoning after eating a packet of the companys snacks seven years ago.

 This is the first time a city consumer court has penalised a company for selling unhygienic food.

 Calcutta District Consumer Redressal Forum president A.K. Das and member L.K. Banerjee, in their verdict, directed the company to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 each to Jay Kumar Verma and Mahesh Verma, residents of Suren Sarkar Road, within 60 days.

 Haldiram Bhujiawala is also directed to pay Rs 3,000 to each complainant as litigation cost within two months, the order stated.

 Owner of the company Prabhusankar Agarwal said he had not received a copy of the judgment. We will act only after getting a copy, he stated.

 On April 29, 2000, Jay and Mahesh Verma had purchased five packets of Haldiram Bhujiawala masala namkin for Rs 90 from authorised dealer Swad Snack Bar on Moti Sil Street. Two of the packets were from batch D and had been packed in April 2000. The rest of the packets, from batch E, showed the packaging date as May 2000. 

 Petitioners counsel Subhash Priyadarshi told the forum that after eating the contents of a batch E packet, the Verma brothers fell ill. Jay had to be admitted to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, where his ailment was diagnosed as food poisoning. 

 Mahesh visited a leading homoeopath the next day. He was told that he, too, was suffering from food poisoning. The Vermas lodged a complaint at Taltala police station on April 30, 2000. The officer-in-charge of the thana seized four packets of the snacks from the dealer.

 The next year, the brothers lodged a complaint with the state district consumer redressal forum.

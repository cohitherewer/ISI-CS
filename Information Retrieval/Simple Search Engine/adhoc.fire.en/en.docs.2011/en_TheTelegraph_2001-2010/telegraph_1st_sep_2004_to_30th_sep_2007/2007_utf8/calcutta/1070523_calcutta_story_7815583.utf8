 Absconding man held for wifes death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nazeem Warsi, who had been absconding with his two children since his wife was found in flames last Thursday, has been arrested.

 A team from Garden Reach police station rounded up Warsi from a relatives house in Ramnagar on Tuesday afternoon. A murder charge has been slapped on him, but sleuths are not certain whether Warsi had set his wife on fire.

 Neighbours were alerted on seeing smoke billowing from Warsis Dhankheti house, in Garden Reach, early on Thursday. They barged in and found Reshma Khatoon, 25, in flames.

 She was taken to a local hospital, where she was declared dead.

 Warsi, a tailor, told police during interrogation that he had had a quarrel with Reshma on Wednesday night over buying a fan.

 Unable to bear the sweltering heat, Reshma demanded that I buy a ceiling fan immediately. I told her that I could not afford a fan now and promised to buy her a table fan next month. But she threatened to commit suicide if I did not bring home a fan by the next day. In disgust, I told her to do whatever she wished to and went to sleep, Warsi reportedly told the police.

 He said he woke up around 3.30am, when the room was filled with smoke. For a moment I thought my house had caught fire. I started looking for my wife and children. To my shock, I saw Reshma in flames. It was a terrible sight. I could not bear it and decided to flee with my children.

 Deputy commissioner of police (port) Rajiv Mishra said Warsi might not have set his wife on fire.

 A murder case has been started against him, but we need to record his statement as well. Our officers are interrogating him. A probe is on to ascertain what had triggered the incident, Mishra said.

 Officers of Garden Reach police station visited Dhankheti and spoke to Warsis neighbours to find out whether he tortured his wife.

 No one said he did, though they added that Warsi and Reshma would fight quite often over what seemed to be trivial matters, said an officer investigating the case.

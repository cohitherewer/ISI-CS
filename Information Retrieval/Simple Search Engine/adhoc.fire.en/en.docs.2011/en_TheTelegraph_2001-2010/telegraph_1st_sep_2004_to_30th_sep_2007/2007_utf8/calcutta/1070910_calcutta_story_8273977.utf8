The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Squalor and neglect bog down Chinese hub

 - A dwindling community fights administrative apathy to keep its restaurants running

 SUBHRO SAHA 

It used to be that wretched strip of swamp to which petty criminals were banished and where even stray dogs didnt go to shit. Squalor and neglect continue to dominate Chinatown in Tangra, despite its lure of chowmein and chilli chicken.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporations (CMC) recent pledge of correcting a serious aberration and extending basic civic infrastructure to Chinatown has brought into sharp focus the plight of the citys ethnic Chinese community, that has shrunk from 15,000-plus three decades back to 1,500-odd now.

 Metro goes to Chinatown

 YESTERDAY

 The outlook was not so grim when I shifted to Chinatown in the early 1970s, recalls Ying W. Chu, the secretary-general of the Huan Bao Tannery Owners Council, comprising the 50-odd members who have agreed to shift to the Bantala leather complex council. The 64-year-old tannery owner was born and brought up on Bentinck Street, part of the 100-odd Chinese families living on the stretch between Paradise cinema and the Chitpur mosque.

 In 1971-72, there was a revolution in the leather industry and there was suddenly a lot of money to be made from selling semi-finished leather to exporters, recalls Chu.

 The Wet Blue variety of semi-finished leather from Chinatown was exported to France, the UK and the East Bloc nations and fresh money got injected into the community. The ethnic Chinese of Chinatown also developed a glazed-finish type of leather called the China Chrome, their biggest contribution to the Indian leather industry. They were the sole suppliers and it was sold at a premium in the London market, remembers Ajit Kumar Sen, the honorary director of the council.

 The 77-year-old leather expert, who joined the United Nations as a consultant in foreign trade after retiring from the Indian Civil Service, says Chinatown used to produce 70-80 per cent of the leather in the Indian industry in the 70s.

 But they didnt have any marketing skills and could never really capitalise on the boom, laments Sen, tracing the neglect of the community back to the Sino-Indian conflict of 1962.

 The trickle of people leaving Chinatown became a flood after 1975, when quota restrictions triggered a slowdown.

 TODAY

 Neither the state government, nor the CMC, has ever done anything for us and we live in the same neglect today as we did five decades ago when I arrived here. Theres no drainage system, we dont have filtered drinking water, there are no streetlights and no garbage disposal, complains 65-year-old Chee Chieng. 

 The lanky leather merchant landed at Dum Dum airport a 13-year-old, making the journey from Hong Kong cramped with dozens of others on a small propeller plane.

 Almost all of us came from the Meihsien district in the state of Canton. It was an arduous bus ride from Meihsien to Guang Zhou, from where we took the boat to Hong Kong, smiles P.L. Chen, who was on the same ferry to Hong Kong as Chieng, and has been living in Chinatown for the past 52 years. 

 Chen, a champion on the national veterans table tennis circuit, is in the tannery trade, battling the step-motherly attitude of the authorities.

 What is galling is that we are all Indian citizens with voter IDs, part of the same taxation structure as the rest of Calcutta, but without basic facilities. We have to fend for ourselves in every sphere, even safety and security of our folk. Look at the condition of the roads here even taxi drivers refuse passengers to Chinatown, points out Yeh Chi Yen, the president of Huan Bao council.

 Most tannery owners who didnt relocate to Bantala have converted their premises into eateries and so Chinatown is now dotted with over 40 restaurants, big and small.

 Others are desperately trying to eke out a living by making fishballs from the top half of the chitol fish a hit with the citys diplomatic community or conjuring up varieties of sauces, or seeking other non-polluting sources of income in a small-scale industry format.

 TOMORROW

 Chee Chiengs two sons, Yung and Chih, are in Canada. Ditto with P.L. Chen Chens sons, Kuo Yen and Kuo Piao. Both the fathers are hoping theyll return to bolster the family business.

 Some boys have indeed returned, fanning hopes of a reverse traffic. For 23-year-old Clayton Lee, who is back after doing his BBA in Toronto, time has stood still in Chinatown since he left it to study abroad. Like Alice Seeli, who has returned after studying banking and finance in Taiwan, Clayton feels the place desperately needs a makeover and the mindset of the community needs to change. 

 We have been working on a plan for an integrated makeover, so that Chinatown becomes a tourist attraction as in major western cities like San Francisco and Vancouver, says Robert Lee, Claytons father and a leading leather merchant. 

 Chinatown is located en route to downtown Calcutta from the airport. With careful planning and proper civic infrastructure, we can engineer a total urban renewal which can not only make it a tourist draw, but also weave the gated community into the citys mainstream, believes veteran architect Dulal Mukherjee, who has been working on a concept urban design for Chinatowns revival.

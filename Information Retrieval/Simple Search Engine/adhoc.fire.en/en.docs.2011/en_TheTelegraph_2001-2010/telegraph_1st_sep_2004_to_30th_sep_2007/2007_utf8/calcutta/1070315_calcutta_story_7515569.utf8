 Crime calling for youth

 PRONAB MONDAL

 They are young, hail from decent families and held steady jobs, but chose to take up crime. Now, officers of the detective department are on their trail, after a series of dacoities and other crimes.

 Four of the youths, who work independently, are among Lalbazars most wanted criminals. According to senior officers, they operate as cleanly as those who have been in the field for decades.

 We were surprised to know that the youths once held good jobs. We know of an IT professional and a call centre employee who have turned robbers, said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh.

 Police found out about the call centre employee, identified as Mohammad Yusuf, a couple of months ago. He used to work in a BPO unit in Salt Lake. We have charged him with three robberies. His victims were either coming out of banks or were on their way to banks to deposit money, said an officer of the detective department. Yusuf had allegedly snatched more than Rs 2 lakh from a private firm employee in Gariahat.

 The IT professional used to earn a salary of Rs 30,000 per month in a Bangalore firm. We have information that he was involved in nearly half a dozen robberies across Calcutta, disclosed the officer.

 Another officer said there are two more youths from decent backgrounds who are absconding. All of them are educated. Their parents had no idea about their involvement in criminal activities. When we told them that their sons had carried out robberies, they were stunned. The young men have not been in touch with their families for a long time, said Singh.

 The youths led fast lives and were regulars at nightclubs frequented by criminals. Thats how they got into crime, explained a senior officer at Lalbazar.

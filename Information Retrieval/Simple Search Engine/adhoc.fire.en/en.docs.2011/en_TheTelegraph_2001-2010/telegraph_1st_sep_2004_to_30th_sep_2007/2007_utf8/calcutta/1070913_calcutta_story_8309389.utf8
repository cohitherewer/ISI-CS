 Suicide by VIP guard

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Power minister Mrinal Banerjees personal security guard committed suicide by shooting himself in the Special Branch office on Lord Sinha Road on Wednesday morning. 

 Asesh Mishra, 44, wrote in the suicide note found in his pocket that he had been going through an acute financial crisis and was hence committing suicide. 

 He addressed a few lines to the minister and the deputy commissioner (special branch), Vineet Goyel, requesting them to look after his family, said an officer.

 Please sir, dont let those who lent me money put pressure on my family, wrote the Special Branch constable.

 Mishra had borrowed money from several people three years ago for his daughters marriage. But he was not in a position to repay the debt, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 The constable left his home in Ballys Ghoshpara in the morning and reported for duty as usual. Mishra was supposed to guard the minister. He collected his service revolver from the armoury and entered a room, added an officer. A group of labourers was working in an adjacent room. Suddenly, there was a gunshot.

 The labourers and the policemen rushed to the room and found Mishra lying on the floor with the revolver in his right hand and blood oozing from his head.

 Banerjee said: He was almost like a family member. He had been my guard since the day I became a minister 11 years ago. Three years ago his daughter got married to my confidential assistants brother. Mishra had never hinted about his financial or personal problems. I was shocked to hear the news of his suicide.

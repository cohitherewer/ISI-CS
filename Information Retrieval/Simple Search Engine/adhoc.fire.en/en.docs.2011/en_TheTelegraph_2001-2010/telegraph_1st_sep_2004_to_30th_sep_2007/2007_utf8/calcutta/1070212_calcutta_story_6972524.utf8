 Pedalling a cause

 - Polio vitim on nationwide cycle crusade

 This is the tale of a crusader on a bicycle. Mahadev Khashaba Patil has polio in his right leg. But the handicap has not deterred the 39-year-old farmer from undertaking a nationwide tour on two wheels.

 He is travelling to all state capitals, meeting the chief ministers and governors. And he is doing it for a noble cause.

 My message to everyone is not to gift us wheelchairs or crutches on World Handicap Day. Give us opportunities. Our brain and other faculties work as well as any other persons, says Patil, who left home in Satara, near Mumbai, on November 25 last year. He is currently camping in Calcutta to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi. 

 Patil has toured Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and now, West Bengal. And his mode of transport for the 6,400 km he has covered has been an ordinary bicycle. 

 He left home with three sets of clothes and Rs 10,000. He admits that though the administrations in some of the states have not been very kind to him, the common people have helped him with food and shelter.

 This is not the first time he is cycling for a cause. In 1999, he had pedalled all the way to New Delhi to meet then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He had to sit on a fast to get an audience. The government has made so many policies for the challenged, like pension schemes and bank loan facilities. But none of these is percolating to the interiors of the country. I once tried getting a job, but failed, says Mahadev.

 He took part in the National Games for the Challenged in 1994 and 2000 and had won medals in cycling and swimming.

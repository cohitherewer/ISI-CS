The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro heads deeper north

 - Six-km proposed extension to take underground railway link past Dum Dum to Baranagar

 SIMI KAMBOJ

With the Metro Railway extension project from Tollygunge to Garia nearing completion and scheduled to be flagged off by 2007-end, the state government is targeting another extension of the underground network.

 And after south, its the turn of the north, as the state government is proposing an underground railway link up to Baranagar, on BT Road.

 In February-end, the state transport department wrote to the Railway Board seeking a six-km extension of Metro Railway, from Dum Dum Junction to Baranagar. Railway minister Lalu Prasad has given his go-ahead for conducting a feasibility study for the project, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Sunday.

 Pegged to cost Rs 500 crore, the project connecting Dum Dum and BT Road will make visits to Dakshineswar, just two km from the terminal Metro station, easier.

 In its letter to the Railway Board, the state government has agreed to consider sharing the cost on mutually-agreed terms, said a state government official. 

 The government wants the board to conduct a feasibility study in 2007-08 and allocate funds in the next fiscal. 

 Passenger flow in Metro will increase if the stretch is added to the existing network. The construction of the second Vivekananda Bridge will be an added advantage, as it will then connect Howrah and beyond to Metro services, right through Calcuttas central business district and up to New Garia, added the official.

 At present, Metro services are available along the north-south axis of the city, over a length of 16.45 km.

 A recent survey has found the Metro occupancy rates to be as low as 33 per cent between 7 am and 9 am and 55 per cent between 7.30 pm and 9.45 pm. The occupancy crosses 70 per cent only during peak hours, between 9 am and 11 am and from 4.50 pm to 7.30 pm.

 The project will lessen the load on the Sealdah Main, Dankuni and Bongaon lines and also in the South Suburban Section, said Amitava Nandy, member of Parliament and member of the railway consultative committee.

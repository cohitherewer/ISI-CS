The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 No English? Dont fly to London

 - Immigration officials harass and detain 55-year-old woman passenger

 SANJAY MANDAL

 As India celebrates the 60th anniversary of Independence, a citizen smarts under the insult meted out to her at Calcutta airport for not speaking English.

 Saleha Iqbal, 55, was harassed and detained by immigration officials for over half an hour on July 7 as she could not reply to their queries in English. The central Calcutta resident, travelling alone, was on her way to London to join her sister, who had lost her husband two weeks before.

 Strangely, her inability to speak English did not land her in trouble at Heathrow airport, in London, said Salehas son Mohammed Asif Iqbal.

 Asif has written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the airport authorities, seeking action against the guilty officials.

 Saleha, who had booked a ticket on an Air-India flight, reached the airport on time and after checking in, went to immigration counter 4 for clearance.

 The immigration officials asked her whether she could speak English, as she was conversing with them in Hindi. When she said she could not, one of them yelled at her, saying she had no business travelling to London if she could not speak the language, said Asif, an executive in a software company.

 The official asked her to wait and took away her passport and ticket. Others then started interrogating her. They asked her what her husband did, why she was travelling alone and where she would stay in London. They had suddenly become suspicious of an innocent woman simply because she was not speaking English, said Asif.

 Nervous and humiliated, Saleha called her husband from her cellphone. My father wanted to talk to the immigration officials, but they refused to speak to him, Asif recalled. When Asif was informed about the situation by his father, he called Air-India officials, who sorted out the matter.

 Immigration officials said an inquiry was conducted. We have asked our officials not to say anything that may hurt passengers feelings, said Basab Talukdar, the foreign regional registration officer. The woman was asked to wait so our officers could question her, as she did not speak English.

 Reformed jailbird cops helpline

 - Killers former aide gave sleuths breakthrough in Posta trader murder

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 A trusted aide of Narayan Mondal, who was wanted by police for the better part of the 1990s, helped them arrest the extortionist responsible for businessman Uttam Chaurasias murder in Posta on Friday night.

 Syria Tanti, 38, is now a reformed man. He sells fruits on Vivekananda Road, off Ganesh Talkies, for a living and lives in a nearby slum with his wife and two children. 

 On Sunday, he told the officers of Posta police station the exact spot where Mondal was hiding after shooting Chaurasia dead. The officers raided the hideout and arrested the extortionist.

 We were in a fix over the case until Tanti provided us the lead. We are planning to reward him for his help. Had he not tipped us off, Mondal could have escaped, says an investigating officer. 

 Tanti was involved in several extortion and dacoity cases with Mondal in Burrabazar in the mid-1990s. 

 He has been to jail thrice. The last term he served six years of rigorous imprisonment for a dacoity in 1996 changed his life.

 Mondal came out, formed a gang and again started extorting businessmen in the area. He also started providing shelter to criminals from other states. 

 But Tanti refused to work with him. Instead, he married a girl from Bihar and settled down.

 I do not want to be in the limelight. I have a family now and want to live in peace. Whatever I did is my duty, he says, sitting in his roadside stall.

 But he is afraid of the consequences of his act. They might attack me for helping the police. The officers have assured me that they will give me protection, but I am not convinced. I am very scared now. Even other criminals in the area might try to eliminate me, considering me as a threat.

 And the past often gets in the way of his future. There are times when the police harass me if there is a crime in the area. But I have buried the past and do not want to recollect anything. I am very happy with my wife and children, he says, quickly getting back to his customers.

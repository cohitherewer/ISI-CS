 Home science and high-pay avenues

 MITA MUKHERJEE

A degree in home science will lead you to a rewarding future.

 A section of educationists has launched a campaign to spread this message among students and parents.

 As part of the campaign, a conference was organised by the home science department of JD Birla College, affiliated to Jadavpur University. Home science experts from across the country attended the seminar.

 Parents and students are unaware of the fact that home science is a blend of fine arts, science and humanities. A degree in the subject will enable students to land a high-income job, said home scientist and adviser to National Assessment and Accreditation Council Mariamma A. Varghese, who attended the seminar.

 The national association of home scientists is trying to find out ways to popularise the subject. We are also planning to change the name of the subject from home science to consumer science, added Varghese.

 The career opportunities for students passing with a B.Sc honours degree or a postgraduate degree in home science are immense, said Deepali Singhee, principal, JD Birla College.

 For instance, those specialising in food and nutrition could work as trainee dieticians or sales and marketing executives in companies dealing with nutritional products, or as nutritionists in bakeries and food preservation units, she added.

 An expert in the subject stressed that the home science curriculum comprises much more than tips on how to become good homemakers by mastering etiquette, needlework, cooking, painting, music and flower decoration.

 JD Birla College has written to the heads of all prominent schools, requesting them to make their students aware of the career opportunities in home science.

 The number of home science colleges in Calcutta has not increased because the parents and students here are more inclined towards engineering and medical streams, said Singhee. In fact, the demand for the subject here is lowest among all prominent cities in the country.

 Apart from JD Birla, the only other college in Calcutta that teaches the subject is Beharilal College of Home Science, affiliated to Calcutta University.

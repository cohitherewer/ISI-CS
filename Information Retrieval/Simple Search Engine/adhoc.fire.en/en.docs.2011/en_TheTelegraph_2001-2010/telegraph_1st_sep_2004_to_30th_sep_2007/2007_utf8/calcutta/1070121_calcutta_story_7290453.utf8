 Birthday bonanza

 On his 73rd birthday, Soumitra Chatterjee got a gift that cine-goers would cherish as much as he would. A portal on him and his achievements was unveiled on Friday. The evergreen cinestar was himself present to click-start the site.

 I am computer illiterate, the birthday boy admitted as the first page of www.soumitralive.com filled the screen. The site has been divided into six sections the man, his career, the Ray connection, nostalgia, bulletins, contributions.

 It traces his story from Krishnagar where he spent the first 10 years of his life. From Mirzapur Street, the residence of his maternal uncle where he put up on reaching Calcutta, to his idolising of and acting with Sisir Bhaduri, his job with All India Radio (AIR), to approaching Satyajit Ray and getting cast as Apu in Apur Sansar, to his more recent exploits on stage and with the pen.

 The site boasts of rare family photographs and film posters. There is a full listing of books by and on Soumitra, plays and films, year by year, alongside cast, producer, date of release and halls where they were released, updated till Padakkhep.

 It is a shame that there is such paltry information on a doyen like Soumitra Chatterjee on the Net while so much exists on actors of the West. We will keep enriching it as we get access to more data, hopefully from readers, said Joy Chatterjee of banglalive.com. 

 As the platinum-haired Soumitra watched the pages scroll, friends from the industry kept him company. Sanjay Mukhopadhyay, director of Roopkala Kendra, later rued the lack of quality film research in the country. 

 Bibhas Chakraborty recounted his contribution to the stage. He came late but once he did he gave us a body of startling work in quick succession, starting from Namjibon to the recent Homapakhi. For Sandip Ray, it was a difficult task to speak about one who is so close to his family. He is one of us since 1959. Gradually, he is taking the place of Chhabibabu (Biswas) in the industry.

 Sabyasachi Chakraborty, who has succeeded Soumitra as Feluda, saluted him as his inspiration. I worked with him in my first work on television as well as film. The first stage production I went to see had him in the lead. The lanky actor went on to claim him as his father-in-law. His elder brother is my father-in-laws classmate back in Krishnagar, he reasoned, to the delight of the audience.

 If Soumitra was happy to have made his virtual presence felt, he made another wish on the occasion similar sites for his contemporaries and predecessors. Joy Chatterjee later hinted that they had taken the suggestion to heart, though they would first see the response to this site.

 Postscript: In under 24 hours, the bulletin board is filling up with laudatory messages from Soumitra fans in Nashville, New Jersey, New Delhi...

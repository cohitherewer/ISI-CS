 Water woes for upgraded buses

 More than half of the 145-odd buses at the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) depots across the city have ceased to be roadworthy, thanks to lack of upkeep. And the rest, despite being upgraded with new engines in the past year, are having a bad run.

 Sources said absence of enough servicing engineers and poor quality of water used in the radiators are affecting the performance of the buses.

 Water used at the Maniktala, Kasba and Salt Lake depots has high iron content, leading to deposition in the box. The Kasba depot used to buy water from tankers even two months ago. The practice has been stopped, though the quality of water available locally remains the same, said an official.

 Passengers often complain that the state buses get stranded midway. Last month, some employees at the Kasba depot had refused to work to protest the lack of proper upkeep of the vehicles.

 The buses would stop mid-way and had to be towed to the depot. We had no idea what went wrong as the engines were new, said the official.

 On Wednesday last, two private companies inspected several buses at the Maniktala depot and concluded that excessive use of the vehicles and sedimentation in the radiators were impeding their smooth run.

 Most state buses are 15-20 years old, whereas the motor vehicle rules state that buses more than 10 years old or those that have run 5,00,000 km cannot ply in the city, said automobile expert S.M. Ghosh, who was in the inspection team. 

 Even the buses with upgraded engines cannot perform to their optimum capacity, as the other parts are in a poor condition, he added.

 Thanks to the sedimentation in the radiators over the years, he pointed out, the water-bearing capacity of the engines has reduced from 22 litre to 17-18 litre. 

 The de-scaling and anti-scaling treatment that usually takes an hour or so took more than three hours during the inspection, Ghosh said.

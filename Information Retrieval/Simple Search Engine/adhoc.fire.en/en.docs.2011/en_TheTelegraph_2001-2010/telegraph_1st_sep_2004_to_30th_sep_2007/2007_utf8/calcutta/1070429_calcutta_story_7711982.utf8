The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Kurseong

 A somewhat lesser known destination in the tourist map of India is Kurseong. Travellers to the perennial favourite Darjeeling often miss this place on their way with a cursory glance. But this dreamy world of the white orchid, kurson-rip in Lepcha, has more to it. 

 Nestled in the lower regions of the Himalayas at an altitude of 1,458 mt (4,864 ft), between Darjeeling and Siliguri, Kurseong is a place that makes a separate impression altogether.

 It is a town of schools, with several institutions more than a century old providing education to students from across the country and from abroad. 

 The heritage Darjeeling Himalayan Railways, recognised by Unesco, has its headquarters in Kurseong.

 One of the most striking sights in the town for a tourist is the colourful toy train which runs on the level of the main streets. 

 It was once considered fashionable for the rich and the famous of Calcutta to have a summer residence at Kurseong. The big names that have been associated with Kurseong include Rabindranath Tagore, Sister Nivedita, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Mark Twain.

 The mild, healthy climate in Kurseong and the tranquil surroundings attract many looking for a relaxing holiday.

 Eagles Crag, which is a short walk from the railway station, has a tourist complex. It is the vantage point for viewing the mountains and the valley. From the garden in the complex, Kanchenjunga can be seen along with other peaks of the Himalayan range. In the distance, the hills flatten out to form the extensive plains of north Bengal.

 Tea bushes are ubiquitous around the town. Kurseong is surrounded by many tea gardens that produce the finest Darjeeling tea. Tea from the towns outskirts can be found at exclusive stores abroad and even at the Nasa space station. 

 A climb to the Dowhill area is a must. The forest museum, deer park and the water reservoir, surrounded by moss-covered conifers are major tourist attractions.

 There are several trekking trails around Kurseong from the short walk along St Marys Grotto to more strenuous climbs. There are also day-long treks from Kurseong to Mirik via Namsu and Balasun River and eco-treks past cinchona plantations and Sherpa villages. 

 You can also ramble on roads like Aranya Sarani that lead to the vast open meadows of Chimney at 7,000 ft. The place derives its name from a long chimney standing there which is reminiscent of the days when there was a bungalow there. The route also leads to Tiger Hill, which offers magnificent view of the Kanchenjunga. Tourists assemble here every morning to view the sunrise. 

 Just outside Kurseong and on the way to Darjeeling is Woodcot. Established and managed by Father Abraham, who is originally from Canada, this innovative eco-friendly farm works towards supporting local villages through a dairy project, compost plant, ingenious solar water heating projects, biogas units for cooking and mushroom cultivation. 

 There is also a school for children, a production facility for jholas and muras by the blind, organic vegetable farming and other innovative practices. 

 The tourist activities around Kurseong include angling in the Balasun river and picnic along its bank near the remnants of an hydel power project, set up by the British. The Kettle valley, just outside the town, is another beautiful picnic spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 You cant get through this week without 

 Tracking bridal buys 

 The countrys biggest annual 

 exhibition of wedding finery, Bridal Asia 2007, is finally 

 here after a one-and-a-half-year gap. With 70 designers 

 offering their trousseau creations, be sure to track everything 

 here from clothes to jewellery, mehndi to stationery 

 designers and choreographers to caterers. Read about the 

 bridal buzz in Delhi right here in GoodLife and update 

 your style quotient from the marriage mart. Watch out for 

 the Calcutta connection. The city will be represented by 

 Anamika Khanna, Monapali, Abhishek Dutta, Arnab Sen Gupta, 

 Minaxi Dadoo and Suman Nathwani for clothes, Vasundhara 

 Mantri, Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons and Siltouch for 

 accessories.

 Night-shopping at Shisha 

 Calcuttas party circuit 

 is about to tread a new path this week as it gets a taste 

 of Le Souks night bazaar. The first edition will be 

 held at Shisha, from 6 pm this Wednesday. The eight participating 

 brands are Vasundhara Mantri, Anupama Jalan, Hugli, Medhavini 

 Khaitan, Sumeru, Leena Kejriwal, Aparna Kumar and Dipiksha 

 Murarka. Drop in for a dose of midnight shopping.

 Rooting for reality amp; Shilpa

 As Shilpa Shetty makes herself 

 comfortable in the first week of Celebrity Big Brother 

 House, Asian viewers of Channel 4 television just cant 

 get enough of her. Shilpa is doing all things right, from 

 waking up early to doing her hair and make-up, cooking breakfast, 

 making conversation and so on. But all those rights are 

 adding up to a wrong she isnt doing anything controversial 

 or scandalous to ensure a long run on the reality show. 

 Cut to India and the desi counterpart Bigg Boss is 

 scaling one dramatic height after another Amit Sadhs 

 uncontrollable sobs and personal problems to 

 the Rupali vs Ravi war. Are you in it?

 Going to see Guru

 Will they, wont they... 

 when will they? Speculation on the Ash-Abhishek wedding 

 can take a backseat for a while as you go and watch their 

 on-screen chemistry (or the lack of it) in Guru. 

 The film is said to be based on the life of Dhirubhai Ambani. 

 Catch the magical music by A.R. Rahman in this Mani Ratnam 

 venture. And if none of this excites you, go catch it for 

 the sake of a certain Mallika Sherawat (and theres 

 much to see, albeit briefly) back with a bang with her first 

 item number in the years first big Bollywood release.

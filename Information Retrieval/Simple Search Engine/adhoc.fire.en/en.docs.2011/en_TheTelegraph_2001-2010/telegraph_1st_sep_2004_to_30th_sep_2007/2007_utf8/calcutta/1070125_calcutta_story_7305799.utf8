 Green activists opposing the Book Fair on the Maidan teamed up on Wednesday to conduct a first-ever study on the effect of the annual mela on the citys lungs.

 The activists measured the levels of respirable particulate matter (RPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) at the fair site during the day. The process will be repeated during and after the fair and the findings submitted to the high court as part of the green lobbys plea not to allow the Book Fair on the Maidan.

 The SPM on the Maidan on Wednesday was found to be 1,675 microgram per cubic metre, against the permissible limit of 500 at this time of the year, and the RPM 280, against the permissible limit of 150. 

 We will be back during and after the fair to make a comparative study of pollution in and around the area, said Sudipto Bhattacharya, of Saviours and Friends of Environment (SAFE), which has been conducting the study.

 The level of pollution is always very high at the fair site. According to the pollution control board, it goes up six times after the fair, he added.

 This is the first time such a move has been made... So far, it had been an individual effort lacking in accuracy, said green activist Subhas Dutta.

 The green lobby also organised a march down Red Road, from Victoria Memorial Hall to Fort William, protesting the armys decision to allow the Publishers and Booksellers Guild to hold the Book Fair on the Maidan.

 Saplings in one hand and books in the other, the protesters shouted slogans against the state governments role in support of the Guild, a profit-making organisation.

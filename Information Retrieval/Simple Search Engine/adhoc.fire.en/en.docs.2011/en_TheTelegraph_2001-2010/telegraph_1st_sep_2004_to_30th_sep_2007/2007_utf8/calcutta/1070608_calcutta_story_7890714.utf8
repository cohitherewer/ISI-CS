 Flat-owners in fraud cry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Owners and allottees of flats in a New Town housing estate have alleged that the buildings suffer from constructional defects and that the promoters have not fulfilled several of their promises.

 An ad hoc committee of flat-owners (MIG and LIG) of Shree Housing Complex has claimed that the promoters, Bengal DCL Limited (BDCL), have not shown any interest in addressing the issues over the past one-and-a-half years.

 The promoters, however, have denied having reneged on any of its promises. As for constructional defects, they say repairs are on, though residents claim these are mere patchwork.

 There are three facilities that were mentioned in the brochure but have not been provided, said Basant Singh, secretary of the committee, which calls itself Shree Housing Society.

 The three facilities are a community ground for cultural activities, a community centre and a residents club with a gym and other facilities.

 Cracks have appeared on the roofs and in the walls, resulting in water seepage. The promoters have done only some patchwork that will not solve the problem, said Singh.

 We do not accept the ad hoc committee, as it does not have the support of at least 51 per cent of the allottees/owners, said Arun Guha, managing director of BDCL.

 The letters the committee has sent us have been forwarded to other allottees/owners. Besides, we have been clarifying all the issues that the committee has raised, including facilities, upkeep and registration, he added.

 The ad hoc committee has called a general body meeting of the owners/allottees on June 24 to form a legally recognised association. Once the association is formed, most of the problems will be solved, said Guha. 

 Shree Housing Complex has three clusters HIG, MIG and LIG. Of the total 212 allottees/owners in MIG (180 flats in nine buildings) and LIG (48 flats in three buildings) clusters, only 39 have moved in. Around 55 have let out their flats.

 Most of the apartments were bought in September 2003, though the buyers got possession in September 2005.

 HS model answers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Friday asked the state Higher Secondary (HS) council to publish the model answers soon after holding the examinations.

 The move, the court observed, will ensure greater transparency in the evaluation process, as the students would be able to judge their own performance by going through the model answers.

 In the existing system, the model answers to the questions set in the HS exams are distributed only to the examiners.

 Justice Biswanath Somadder ruled on Friday: So many students have been suffering in silence. If the model answers are kept secret, the remedy will be worse than the disease.

 The judge also pointed out that the council should set up a committee of experts to prepare the model answers.

 This follows the revelation that the model answers in several subjects were at variance with the information provided in the textbooks.

 The judge cited a case moved by some students of Kanpur University in Allahabad High Court, challenging the model answers in an examination. The court had ruled that the answers were wrong.

 Justice Somadder observed that complaints about evaluation would continue to pour in unless the council changes its reassessment rules. The council should change its rules on review of answer scripts, he noted.

 The present rules do not allow reassessment. A plea for a review is met with a scrutiny retotalling of marks and a check whether any answer has been left unmarked.

 On a petition by Madhumita Mukherjee, an HS 2007 candidate who has alleged that she had been unfairly assessed, the judge directed the council to appoint a panel of three independent experts who will go through her answer scripts in physics, chemistry and mathematics.

 The judge had earlier gone through the answer scripts of Madhumita and the student who had topped the exams, as well as the model answers.

 The council has been given three weeks to carry out the order. During the next hearing, scheduled for September 28, the council will have to table the report of the experts committee.

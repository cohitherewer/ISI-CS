The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 With Guru, 

 we will raise the bar 

 Screen On amp; Off

 The cinematographer of Bombay RAJIV 

 MENON has collaborated with Mani Ratnam after a decade. The 

 maker of Sapnay tells Pratim D. Gupta why Mani 

 comes second only to Ray

 (Top)Abhishek Bachchan 

 and Aishwarya Rai in Guru, releasing this Friday

 You have shot just three films (Bombay, Morning 

 Raga and Guru) and directed two movies (Sapnay 

 and Kandukondain Kandukondain) in over 12 years. 

 Why?

 Ive underperformed (laughs)! 

 See I also run an advertising concern in Chennai and so 

 dont have the chance to do so many films. Also, for me 

 to shoot a film there has to be a certain level of understanding 

 with the director. The aesthetics have to match and we have 

 to get along. Also, I take time to write my own films. Then 

 again, not many people have approached me to shoot their 

 films. And whichever happened kept getting postponed.

 So how did Guru happen, more than a decade after 

 you shot Bombay for Mani Ratnam?

 Mani and I were doing a stage 

 show on 50 years of Tamil cinema. We were working with a 

 lot of old pictures and footage and it was then that we 

 decided to do a period film together. That eventually became 

 Guru.

 How much has Mani changed 

 in all these years?

 Theres hardly any change at all 

 in him. Working with Mani was as fine this time as it was 

 so many years back. Of course he is now more exposed to 

 cinema. Also, we have lot more of technology at our disposal 

 today than we had 10 years back. So, we both have tried 

 to optimise our visualisation keeping the available technology 

 in mind.

 Has the visual language also 

 changed in these 10 years?

 Today, more shots count 

 for than it did before. The concept of starting with an 

 establishing shot and then going into a mid-shot is all 

 gone. It is a day and age of minimalisation, of simplicity. 

 Everything is more precise, more focused. You cant take 

 a single shot just for the sake of beauty.

 How difficult was it to create 

 1950s Mumbai for Guru?

 It was all digitally created but 

 you wont understand that when you watch the film. Like 

 the 1950s Marine Drive shown in the film is actually the 

 seaface of Pondicherry. We shot in Pondicherry and put the 

 Marine Drive picture plate in the background. We researched 

 a lot about that period and Sharda Dwivedis books on Mumbai 

 helped us a lot. 

 The many websites on the history 

 of Mumbai have lots of information, which helped us in lighting 

 the scenes. Like the fact that mercury vapour lamps were 

 used in the streets only after 1968. Before that they used 

 gas. So rather than blue we used a yellow glow for those 

 scenes. Also, the lights used inside homes were more diffused 

 while those used in offices was very Art Deco with 

 stronger shadows. We all hope that with Guru we will 

 be able to raise the bar, technically, for Indian films.

 What have you done with the 

 colour scheme?

 We had to shoot in Turkey and 

 India. We wanted people to really feel the colours when 

 we show India. So for Turkey we went for a very desaturated 

 look to give it a cold feel. We shot in March and exploited 

 the cloudy weather there. Our bible was an interesting book 

 by a Turkish photographer named Ira Uhler the Cartier-Bresson 

 of Turkey which has a lot of black-and-white photographs 

 of the country.

 For the India leg we chose a village 

 in northern Karnataka named Badami, near Hampi. It was an 

 early Chalukya capital and has beautiful rock cut caves 

 of red sandstone. So we could start from that red and then 

 move on to green. The 1970s portions also have a lot of 

 tube light and so theres blue too.

 What was the plan in terms 

 of camera movement?

 Theres a lot of handheld camera 

 in Gurus initial years of struggle. Then as he ages 

 and becomes powerful, we have used a lot of dolly movements. 

 Its like, by then, the camera starts obeying him rather 

 than countering him. Since the film is essentially about 

 faces, how they change in fear, hope, anger, greed, we have 

 used a lot of close-ups. But we had to keep in mind that 

 too many of them can make it a TV serial.

 During your preparation which 

 are the films you looked at for possible inspiration for 

 the look of Guru?

 Road To Perdition in a 

 big way, where Conrad Hall won the Best Cinematographer 

 Oscar. Then we looked a lot into Christopher Doyles work 

 in In The Mood For Love in the way he has used hard 

 light. And finally, for the wide angles, the look is very 

 Amelie. You know the exuberance in the lensing gives 

 a very hip-hop feel to the images.

 Did you do a lot of storyboarding 

 for the film?

 Not really, apart from some important 

 scenes which we call flag-off scenes. In a biopic like Guru, 

 we have to flag scenes where he starts growing as a person 

 and where he starts changing from within. So we flagged 

 key shots in Turkey, 1970s Mumbai, the AGMs held in stadiums.

 Apart from that Mani doesnt want 

 to do storyboarding. His style of working is very organic. 

 He goes to the location, gets his actors, decides the lens, 

 looks at his eyepiece and starts blocking, and then the 

 shooting follows.

 Finally, do you think that 

 Mani Ratnam will be able to break his Bollywood jinx with 

 Guru?

 I believe Guru will get 

 him some maryada. The way he has gone into the interiors 

 of the human relationship is quite something. I have always 

 felt that Satyajit Ray was the master when it came to showing 

 post-marriage relationship on screen, in films like Apur 

 Sansar, Charulata and Mahanagar. After 

 him comes Mani.

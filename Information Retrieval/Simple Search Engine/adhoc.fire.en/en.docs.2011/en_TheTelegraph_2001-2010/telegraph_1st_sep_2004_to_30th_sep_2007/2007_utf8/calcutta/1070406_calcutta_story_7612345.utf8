 Probe nails tardy police station duo

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Forty-eight hours after Amit Yadav died on Prince Anwar Shah Road, police on Thursday kicked off departmental proceedings against two officers of Jadavpur police station who had allegedly refused to act on time.

 The 27-year-old bled to death late on Tuesday after being hit by a bus, while police quibbled over jurisdiction.

 The move comes a day after a team of senior officers, led by D.P. Singh, additional superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), carried out a preliminary probe at Jadavpur police station to ascertain the cause of Yadavs death.

 The report, holding two officers of the police station responsible, mentions that when students from the adjoining hostel of Jadavpur University had rushed in to seek help from the cops to save Yadav, the officers were settling down after a change of shift.

 A probe has been initiated but we cannot divulge the names of these officers. We will call them and ask them why it took them so long to intervene, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).

 It is not right to cite jurisdiction problems when a mishap victim is lying on the road, bleeding, added Gupta.

 The officer-on-duty, when the students had come seeking help, is also under the scanner and so the police brass will question him as well.

 An agent of a mobile phone company, Yadav was on his way to his Burrabazar home on Tuesday night when a speeding state bus knocked him down near Jadavpur police station, on Prince Anwar Shah Road.

 Students from the nearby hostel rushed out and urged the cops in Jadavpur police station to act. By the time they debated jurisdiction and contemplated action, Yadavs struggle for life had ended. He was declared brought dead in MR Bangur Hospital.

 The post-mortem was completed on Thursday and the youths body handed over to his family.

 Trader shot on road

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Businessman Kishan Lal Jain, 48, was shot dead from point-blank range by three men at Bally, in Howrah, on Tuesday afternoon. According to police, the incident took place around 3 pm. Jain, who was on a scooter, was returning from his scrap iron godown in Ghusuri when the motorcycle-borne trio, brandishing revolvers, intercepted him. 

 One of the three dragged him off his scooter at the crossing of Abhay Guha Road and Girish Ghosh Road. They pumped two bullets into his head and another two into his abdomen. The trio fled immediately, an officer of Bally police station said. 

 Jain died on the spot. His body lay in a pool of blood in the middle of the road. Residents of the area turned violent and clashed with officers of Bally police station when they arrived on the spot. They did not allow the policemen to remove the body.

 Around 150 people blocked the crossing, protesting the murder. They turned violent when we tried to reason with them. The situation was brought under control around 4.30 pm and the body taken to Howrah General Hospital for post-mortem, an officer said.

 Preliminary investigation revealed that the murder was a fallout of a business rivalry.

 Jain dealt in scrap iron and he recently bagged a railway tender. His business rivals threatened him to quit the trade or face the consequences, an investigating officer disclosed. 

 Jain had financed Rakhal Das, another scrap dealer. He is suspected of having a hand in the murder. This is a clear case of business rivalry. We have detained one person and interrogation is on. Raids are on to arrest Das and others, said Niraj Singh, superintendent of police (Howrah). 

 Residents of the area said criminals rule the roost and police turn a blind eye. Over the past six months, the zone has witnessed several snatching cases and robberies. Extortion is also on the rise. Todays incident is a grim reminder of the deteriorating law and order, complained Rammohan Gupta, a local trader.

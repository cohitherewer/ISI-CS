The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Speedy relief in airport queues

 - Two of three new security counters to be opened by end of May

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Come June, passengers wont have to wait long to board a flight at the airport. 

 Three security counters are being set up to ease the flow of domestic travellers. A new escalator, X-ray machines and three more aero-bridges are also being planned. 

 Currently, there are only two security counters at the terminal, which leads to long queues of passengers during peak hours. On an average, it takes 90 minutes to complete the formalities before boarding a flight.

 Airport director V.K. Monga said on Tuesday: Two of the security counters will be operational before May-end. 

 On Wednesday, various operating agencies of the airport will meet to discuss the mode of operations at the new security counters. The additional CISF personnel needed to man these counters have been commissioned by the authorities in Delhi.

 There is also a plan to install a new escalator. Three new aero-bridges, which connect the security hold to the aircraft, could also be added to the existing three.

 About 210 aircraft fly in and out of Calcutta airport every day. The number of flights per day was 130 last year. The jump in the number of flights has stretched airport infrastructure.

 An X-ray machine is supposed to scan 300 bags in an hour, but at least 100 more bags are scanned per hour during peak hours, said an airport official.

 Passenger flow for four domestic flights and two international flights can be handled comfortably by the existing staff every hour, said another official.

 But theres little we can do when eight to 10 domestic flights and three to four international flights take off and land at the airport per hour during the peak period, he added.

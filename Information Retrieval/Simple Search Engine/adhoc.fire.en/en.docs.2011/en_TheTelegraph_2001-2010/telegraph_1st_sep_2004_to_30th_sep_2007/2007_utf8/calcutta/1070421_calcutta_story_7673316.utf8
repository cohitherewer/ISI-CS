 Seek loan, walk off with cellphone

 - Two days, two women in crime

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after the arrest of 26-year-old Koyel Mukherjee for duping a businessman, a woman in her 40s was held in Jorabagan on Wednesday for stealing cellphones from offices. 

 The woman, identified as Shyamali Roy, had just come out of a private office with a cellphone allegedly stolen from one of the employees. She visited the office to seek money from the employees for her husbands treatment. According to police, Roy is a key member of a gang of cellphone thieves. 

 We were surprised to come across two women criminals on successive days. No one would suspect Shyamali to be a cellphone thief, but there are cases pending against her at police stations across the city, said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh.

 Her husband is a daily labourer. Shyamali used to enter offices with a sheaf of forged medical records and seek money for her husbands treatment, said Asish Sengupta, officer-in-charge of the detective departments watch section.

 According to him, Shyamali used to keep the documents on a table on which there was a cellphone. While picking up the documents, she would pick up the cellphone, too.

 After interrogating Shyamali, the police have come to know that her accomplices used to wait on the road. She would hand over the handsets to them as soon as she came out of the office, said an officer.

 The police produced Shyamali in front of some men and women whose cellphones she had allegedly stolen. They identified her, stated the officer. We are yet to find out where she stays. She has given us three addresses. All of them proved false, said another.

 Koyel, who is a postgraduate in science, cheated a businessman of Rs 2.6 lakh by promising to arrange a loan for him. Her father is a doctor in Behala. We suspect that she had duped a number of others, said Singh.

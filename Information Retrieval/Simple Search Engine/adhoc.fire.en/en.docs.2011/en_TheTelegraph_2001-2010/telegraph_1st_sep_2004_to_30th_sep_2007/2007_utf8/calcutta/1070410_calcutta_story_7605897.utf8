 For civic forms, ask councillor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has further simplified distribution of civic forms, after allowing them to be downloaded free.

 Citizens without access to a computer or unable to visit the civic counters can now obtain the forms from the local councillor.

 The CMC has 141 councillors. Which means there will be 141 additional counters to collect forms from, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the move is part of the private dialogue initiative under Rs 212.25-crore capacity-building programme, being funded by the British governments department for international development. Forms of public institutions are a forum for public-private dialogue and in this era of transparency, we have decided to make that dialogue toll-free and easier, said Bandyopadhyay.

 Each councillor will be given a set of civic forms. A citizen in need of a particular form can ask the local councillor for a photocopy or can borrow the form and get a photocopy made for himself.

 We have also decided to supply a set of the forms to all public libraries in the city, said Bandyopadhyay. The set will include forms for three national schemes Janani Suraksha Yojana, National Family Benefit Scheme and National Old Age Pension Scheme.

 The authorities have also decided to publish a compendium of all CMC circulars, orders and notifications.

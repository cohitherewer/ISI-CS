 Mailman to marriage linkman

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta postmaster-general Monojit Kumar

 Who says the mailman deals only with letters? On Wednesday, the postal department announced yet another service that adds a novel dimension to the friendly neighbourhood post office. 

 Membership scratch cards of BharatMatrimony.com, a marriage service portal, will now be available at 47 head post offices of Bengal. The facility was available only at the GPO.

 We have entered direct marketing for some time now. Over the past couple of months, we have been selling recharge and ITC cards of BSNL through the head post offices. We also accept electricity bills and income-tax returns, said postmaster-general, Calcutta, Monojit Kumar. 

 The service will take off from Salt Lake. We wanted to utilise the postal departments network of 700 head post offices across 18 states. People grow up trusting the mailman who delivers news of both joy and sorrow. As marriage also involves trust, it was a perfect synergy, explained Uday Zokarkar, business head of the portal.

 The cards are in denominations of Rs 1,390 and Rs 2,190 (for classic cards) and Rs 2,090 and Rs 3,290 (for classic super cards), depending upon the duration of use. For each card that is sold at the post offices, India Post gets paid Rs 140.

 The department has also been handling Western Union money transfers. We are handling 10,000 transactions per month. The growth rate is more than 50 per cent. This has given us the confidence to handle a corporate entity, Kumar pointed out. Tie-ups exist with a number of banks, like UTI and IDBI, too. 

 Another proof of the increasing horizon is acceptance of passport applications at the head post offices. Submit the documents with us; we will send them to the passport office by speed post, Kumar offered.

 And now, electoral lists have been put up at all post offices. In an arrangement with the Election Commission, omissions can be reported by filling up forms available there itself till January 22. 

 The department, that has been hit by decreasing mail volume, is sure finding ways to keep its head above water.

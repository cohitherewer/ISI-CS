 What: Cocktail 

 and dinner party hosted by JSW Steel Ltd.

 Where: Sunderbans, ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 When: Thursday evening, 7.45 pm onwards.

 Take a look: It was a prestige party with an elite guest list to celebrate the signing of the memorandum for the largest steel plant project in Bengal. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, members of the Jindal family and celebrity guests made their way to the green lawns for a cultural programme followed by cocktails and dinner. 

 The decor was classy with a capital C. All the tables neatly arranged on the lawn glowed with white candles placed between bunches of white orchids. Fabric canapes in blue and silver created the top covering under a moonlit night. Up front were special seats for a perfect view of the stage. Sajjan Jindal was the CMs right-hand man for the evening. The backdrop of the stage read Bond of Steel in bold letters.

 A dance sequence by Tanusree Shankar and her troupe held centre stage with excerpts from Rabindranath Tagore recited in the distinctive baritone of Amitabh Bachchan. Amitji was kind enough to recite some of Tagores English poems for us. Our dance presented an innovative approach to Tagore. I wanted to present Tagore in a different way, with a global touch, Tanushree told GoodLife.

 The recital received a standing ovation with chief minister taking a few steps towards the stage to express his appreciation.

 Sip n bite: Appetisers 

 like Shikampuri Kebab, Cajun Spiced Chicken and Thai Corn 

 Patties did the rounds. For the main course there was Murg 

 Rezala, Mahi Masaledar, Qasar-e-Pukhtan, Bagh-e-Subz, Khoya 

 Methi Mutter and Dal Makhni with Masala Kulcha, Pudina Paratha 

 and Butter Naan. Dessert delights included Vanilla Ice Cream 

 with Hot Mixed Fruit Cobbler, Dark and White Chocolate Mousse, 

 Kesariya Phirni and Rasmalai. There was free flow from the 

 bar at one end of the lawn.

 Crowd call: The guest list ranged from British, German and Italian diplomats to business biggies and corporate captains to Tollywood stars. But most eyes were on one man Sourav Ganguly. After stroking his way to a 72 off 73 balls at the Eden, he was relaxed and charming in a blue jacket.

 Voiceover: Sourav certainly made Parths day. The 16-year-old son of Sajjan Jindal was all excited, clutching his most treasured possession, a little bat personally autographed by Dada. 

 My father told me that Sourav was coming but I didnt think that he would actually come. I was so excited to meet him! He is the spirit and the determination that India is all about, gushed the UK-based student. Expressing fondness for the city that his mother Sangeeta Jindal did her schooling from, the teenager smiled and said: If only I was a little older, I would have looked after the factory here myself.

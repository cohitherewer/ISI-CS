 Doctors gherao NRS top brass

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Around 100 members of the Association of Health Services and Doctors gheraoed the authorities of Nil Ratan Sirkar Medical College and Hospital for two-and-a-half hours on Wednesday morning, demanding amenities, restrooms and waiting rooms for patients kin.

 Cops from Entally police station, who arrived on the spot, said the demonstration was peaceful.

 The police said the members wanted to speak to the principal, vice-principal and medical superintendent of the hospital, but were denied entry. It was then that they barged in and gheraoed them.

 According to members of the association, NRS Hospital is a hot spot for touts who have free access to the hospital premises and take unsuspecting people for a ride.

 Relatives of patients are often forced to set up camp on the hospital premises, while their near ones are admitted for treatment. It is unsafe and inconvenient, a member of the association said.

 The hospital authorities finally held a discussion with a team of doctors from the association, who submitted two memorandums to them. The authorities said efforts would be made to improve the situation.

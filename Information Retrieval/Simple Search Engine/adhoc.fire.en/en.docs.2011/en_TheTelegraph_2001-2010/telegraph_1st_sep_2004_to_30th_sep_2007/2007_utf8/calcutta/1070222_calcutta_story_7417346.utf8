 Delay in cataloguing has kept more than three lakh books, journals, newspapers and manuscripts out of bounds for visitors at National Library. 

 Only the catalogued books, which have been transferred to Bhasha Bhavan, built in the complex at a cost of Rs 100 crore, can now be accessed by visitors. Books and journals that have not been catalogued cannot be shifted to Bhasha Bhavan, where the entire library was to be moved in 2004. 

 Three years have passed since the new building was completed, but the important sections and departments of the library are still housed in the old building. It was supposed to have been converted into a heritage property. 

 More than 30,000 titles in Hindi, leave alone other languages, are dumped in the old building. The volumes should have been catalogued and made available to readers long back. There are thousands of other books lying unattended to in the old building, said an official of the Hindi language department of the library. 

 Books in 14 Indian languages and several foreign languages are yet to be catalogued. The acquisition, processing, English journal and administration departments continue to operate from the old building. Even the cash counter is located in the old building, though the photocopiers are at Bhasha Bhavan. 

 Readers are strident in voicing their displeasure at the state of affairs. I often find it difficult to locate books, but there is no library staff to assist me, as most of them are at the old building A world-class library is not expected to operate this way, said Sanjay Mukherjee, head of the political science department of Scottish Church College.

 Even the cafeteria on the ground floor of Bhasha Bhavan has not opened. 

 Library director Sudhendu Mondal told Metro: Books will soon be shifted to the new building. We will also shift our cash office there so that people do not face problems in paying for photocopies. The cafeteria will start operating soon.

 The old building is consuming the same amount of electricity and other resources as before, claimed secretary of National Library staff association Saibal Chakraborty.

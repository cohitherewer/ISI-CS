 Three medical teams from the office of the chief medical officer of health (CMOH) have been despatched to area after the enteric attack last Saturday.

 The deputy CMOH-II, A. Bandopadhyay, who visited the two hospitals on Thursday, said: Unless the leak in the water pipelines is detected and plugged immediately, the spread of enteric disease cannot be checked.

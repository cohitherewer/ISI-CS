 Dumped, twin girls die

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two newborn girls, wrapped in a gunny bag, were found near the Behala airport on Monday morning. Police took the twins to a local hospital, where they were declared dead.

 Witnesses later said the bag was found lying near a bush on Airport Road in Behala. A passerby became suspicious on seeing what he felt was the hand of a baby.

 A crowd soon gathered at the spot. One of them opened the bag and found the babies, hardly a day old. They immediately alerted the police.... It is a most unfortunate incident mirroring the world that we live in despite so much progress and development, said Samir Saha, a resident of the area.

 A team from Behala police station, led by officer-in-charge Swapan Roy, reached the spot and took the twins to Vidyasagar Hospital.

 Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, said: We are trying to find out whether the babies were delivered in any local hospital or nursing home. It seems the twins were premature. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem.

 As news of the dead babies spread, local residents alleged that the area around the airport had become a dumping ground for criminals. A few years ago, the bodies of two youths were found there.

 An airport official said only a part of the premises, spread across 200 acres, has a wall, leaving enough room for outsiders to enter the protected zone after sunset. The police cannot keep an eye on it as they do no not have enough personnel, the official added.

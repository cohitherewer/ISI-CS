 Girl missing, boy blamed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 15-year-old girl, a resident of Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, has been missing since Tuesday.

 Her father, Meghnad Haldar, lodged a police complaint on Thursday, accusing a local youth, also missing since Tuesday, of being involved in the girls disappearance.

 An unidentified man reportedly called the Haldars on Thursday morning and asked them not to contact police.

 Haldar, a resident of Chak Para in Sonarpur, said in his complaint that his daughter, a student of Class IX, went out on Tuesday morning to join her friends in school for Saraswati puja.

 She left home around 10.30 am and told us that she would be back in a couple of hours. But she did not turn up even after sunset. We contacted all her friends but they had no clue where she was, said Haldar, an employee of a private company.

 For the past two days, Haldar called all his relatives but his daughter was with none.

 We are looking into the accused youths track record. We have come to know that he used to tease girls of the locality. His parents have already been grilled, the officer added.

 Police have advised the Haldars to instal a caller-line identification machine at the earliest.

 Additional superintendent of police (industrial) D.P. Singh said teams are being sent to various places in search of the duo. 

 All adjoining police stations have been alerted. We hope the two will be located soon, he said.

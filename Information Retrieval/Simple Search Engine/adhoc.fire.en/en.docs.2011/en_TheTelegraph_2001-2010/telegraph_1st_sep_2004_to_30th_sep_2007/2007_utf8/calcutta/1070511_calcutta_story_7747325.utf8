 CAS II deadline 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The information and broadcasting ministry will issue a notification next week, setting an August deadline for the launch of the second phase of the conditional access system (CAS).

 The launch will cover Kalyani, Dum Dum, Tallah Park, Sodepur, Khardah, Barrackpore, Shyamnagar, Naihati, Kanchrapara and Barasat (comprising Zone II of the Calcutta Metropolitan Area, as decided by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and Esplanade, Park Street, Camac Street, Salt Lake, Lake Gardens, Garia, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge, Tollygunge and the surrounding areas (comprising Zone IV).

 CAS will be launched in Zone III of the CMA, consisting of Howrah, Shibpur, Uluberia, Andul, Liluah, Bally, Uttarpara, Chandernagore and Bandel, in the third phase. The system was launched in Zone I on January 1. 

 The public notification will be out between May 12 and May 15, said a senior official of the ministry on Tuesday. It takes at least three months to roll out CAS in an area, so we have decided to issue the notification well in advance, he stated. 

 According to the official, multi-system operators (MSOs) and cable operators have already made an estimate of the number of set-top boxes required for the second phase of the launch.

 Industry insiders feel the roll-out may not be smooth, with festering disputes between broadcasters and the new MSOs.

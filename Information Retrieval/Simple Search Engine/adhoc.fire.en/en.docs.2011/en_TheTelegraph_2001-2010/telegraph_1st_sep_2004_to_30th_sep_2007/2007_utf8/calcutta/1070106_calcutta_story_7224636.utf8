 Heres one more chance to get up close and personal with the Royal Bengal Tiger. No, this isnt going to win anyone match tickets to Sourav Gangulys next innings, but will surely give people a chance to spot a handsome tiger or two from a fancy deck of a luxury cruise sailing to the Sunderbans.

 In a couple of weeks, Paramhamsa will be ready to set sail from Millennium Park for a 400-km journey, making it the first luxury day-and-night river cruise to the Sunderbans.

 The cruise comes as a complete package that combines luxury with eco-tourism, adventure sports, leisure and nature trek, says M.V. Nath, chairman of Vivada Inland Waterways Ltd, the company launching the river cruise in collaboration with West Bengal Forest Development Corporation (WBFDC).

 WBFDC is going to be playing the role of a guide, advising Vivada Cruises on the routes, signals and information to make every trip a lesson of a lifetime in this Rs 15-crore project. 

 We have joined the venture because Vivada Cruises will showcase the Sunderbans and West Bengal. We will contribute with our expertise of nature, wildlife conservation, Sunderbans and a lot more, says Arin Ghosh, managing director of WBFDC. 

 Paramhamsa will touch Sajnekhali Bird Sanctuary, tiger reserves, Bhagbatpur Crocodile Project and forest reserves on its two-days-and-three-nights trip. 

 Heres what more to expect: The three-deck cruise boasts 32 rooms done by architect and interior designer (and GoodLife columnist) Vivek Rathore, with food and beverage by Pradeep Rosario of Kurry Klub fame.

 We are going to offer a variation of cuisines at the on-board restaurant. There will be a kebab corner, a coffee nook, barbecue facilities and the thrust will be on the Sunderban special menu lots of live tiger prawns, lobsters, crabs and an exotic spread of fish, says Rosario.

 The decor inside Paramhamsa will see the magic of Sunderbans come alive with Rathore turning to the mystique of the delta for inspiration. The colour story will relate to the environment. There will be lots of timber and a sudden splash of brighter colours like magenta, says Rathore. 

 The price tag: Rs 15,000 per passenger for comfort rooms on the main deck and Rs 20,000 per passenger for one of the 12 luxury rooms.

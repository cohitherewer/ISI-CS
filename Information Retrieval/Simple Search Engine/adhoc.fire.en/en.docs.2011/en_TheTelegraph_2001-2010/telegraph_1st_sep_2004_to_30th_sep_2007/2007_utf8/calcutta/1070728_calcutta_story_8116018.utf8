 Father, son held for JEE berth link

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A father-son duo was rounded up in Baranagar on Friday for alleged links with the medical entrance test racket.

 Sourav Das, who ranked 134 in Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) 2007 and took admission at NRS Medical College, and father Sanjib were picked up from their Kashinath Dutta Road residence.

 With their arrest, the number of people behind bars in the case has gone up to 11.

 Sanjib had allegedly settled a deal with Mihir Kumar Jha, the prime accused now in custody, for Rs 5 lakh to ensure his sons entry into a medical college. An employee of a small private firm, he had paid Jha an advance of Rs 1.9 lakh, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department). 

 The sleuths came to know about the duo while interrogating Jha, a first-year postgraduate student of radiology at SSKM Hospital. Jha told us that he had arranged a dummy candidate for Sourav, who was scheduled to attend classes from August, said Kumar.

 Among the others arrested since the scam broke out are Babli Kazmi, who had allegedly taken the test for Rupa Mazumdar, and Syed Abrar, accused of having links with the racket.

 The sleuths have seized a diary of Ranvijay Pathak, a final-year MBBS student at Medical College and a mastermind of the racket.

 The diary revealed that Pathak, now in custody, had plans to set up a coaching centre for medical entrance test in Delhi. He had decided to appoint Ayan Mukhopadhyay, an intern at Medical College and a partner in crime, as head of the centres Calcutta branch, said an officer. He had also planned to earn lakhs by opening yoga institutes.

 More names are surfacing as we are digging deep into the racket. We are hunting for six other key accused, said Kumar.

 The state government is considering handing over the probe to the CBI. Our leads have taken us to Varanasi, Bangalore and Allahabad. If more states get involved in the scam, we may hand over the probe to the CBI, said home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray.

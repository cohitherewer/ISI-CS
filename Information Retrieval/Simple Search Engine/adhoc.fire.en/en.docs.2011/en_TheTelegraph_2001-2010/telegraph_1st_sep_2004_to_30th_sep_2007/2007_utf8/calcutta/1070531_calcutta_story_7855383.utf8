The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Woes soar at airport

 - Flight and passenger count up, but minus a corresponding improvement in facilities

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Tug of war over baggage trolley, one narrow entrance, a severe space crunch, five long queues at five different points before boarding a flight the list of problems faced by passengers at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport is a long one.

 From about 130 daily last year to about 210 daily now, the number of flights has soared, as has the number of passengers. But there has been no proportionate infrastructure development.

 According to airport officials, four domestic and two international flights can be handled every hour at the airport with the existing infrastructure. During rush hour, the flight count rises to 10 domestic flights and four international flights. That explains the chaos, especially in the domestic airport, they point out.

 The Rs 1,500-crore new terminal project is being hailed as the solution to every problem. But that is some distance away. Till then, these are the major problems that passengers will continue to face and fret about at the domestic terminal:

 With just one main entrance to the terminal, passengers have to stand in a long queue at peak time while Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel check each ticket of passengers and visitors. Airport officials say there are no more gates because there are no more CISF personnel to man them.

 Solution in sight: Plan for one more entrance for passengers only once the CISF force increases. (Calcutta airport has around 650 personnel, Mumbai has around 2,000.)

 Although the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has set up 14 more check-in counters, taking the count to 42, there is only one entry point to the check-in area. This causes a bottleneck, with a sole CISF man ushering passengers in after checking each ticket. The queue in the morning stretches way beyond the main entrance. This is unique to Calcutta; why cant they add gates to the check-in zone? demands a frequent flier. Again, because there are not enough CISF personnel.

 Solution in sight: None.

 Trolley trouble greets passengers the moment they step out of the car. There are no trolleys in sight and the few that are, are cornered by helpers (read touts) who often demand a fee for trolley use. As a result, many passengers have to lug their luggage all the way to the check-in counters.

 Officially, there are 2,100 trolleys in the two terminal buildings. But a large number of them cannot be used, either due to poor maintenance or due to them being scattered all around, with those assigned to bring them back to the terminal missing in action.

 The present contractor is running at a loss and so, there is no proper maintenance or service of trolleys, admits a senior airport official.

 Solution in sight: In April, 1,100 new trolleys were sanctioned to end the crisis. These will be added in June, when a new firm is awarded the contract, added the official.

 With passengers spending no less than 90 minutes between arrival at the airport and departure, the need to sit in the lounge is acute. But the number of seats has not been increased for some time now, forcing half the passengers at peak time to be on their feet. Solution in sight: To increase lounge space, a 2,650-square-metre canopy is being built from one end to another. The first phase of the three-phase project is complete; the rest will be carried out by year-end.

 Till recently, there were only two security check counters, causing severe congestion. Five X-ray machines have just been installed in two security holds on the first floor. But officials admit this will not make the queues disappear. A hand baggage X-ray machine is supposed to scan 300 bags in one hour, but during peak hours, the bag count is 400-plus.

 Solution in sight: Slight improvement.

 This year, three cases of missing mobile phones and laptops have been officially recorded. 

 Sources said three mobile phones, on an average, go missing from the security-check counter every week. CISF officials blame it on lack of manpower.

 Solution in sight: A CISF proposal to apply tags on mobile phones and laptops.

 The queue during peak hours is serpentine and slow. Also, the service is not 24x7, as it must be. Those manning the booth said to be patronised by local union toughs refuse to provide services at odd hours. They are even known to demand extra money from passengers.

 Solution in sight: None. Officials insist the pre-paid booth is open 24x7, and alls fine.

 The system often fails to provide accurate information of flight arrival and departure. Sources blame it on frequent system snags.

 Solution in sight: None.

 Its amazing that despite the citys development over the past few years, the schools continue to be run dictatorially. Being an NRI for the 30 years and having stayed in South Africa, the UK and Australia, I read with amusement the article on north Calcutta children being turned away by schools in the south (Distant north, June 24). 

 I have found out over the last two weeks that if you get past the security guard to the principals personal assistant in a good school, you should feel blessed. Trying to admit your child to a good school at this time of the year is almost impossible, unless you have connections. My daughter is losing out on education because I didnt fly in last December to pick up application forms for the best schools in south Calcutta. 

 I believe that the chief minister should look into the functioning of private schools. It is time Calcutta opened its doors to NRIs. In Australia, when a child arrives from another country, the school in the area the child lives in is bound to admit the child.

 The report Rs 15-lakh ransom trap, June 19, could not have come at a better time just before Jamaisashthi and within a couple of weeks of another report on the obsession of girls parents for techie sons-in-law. 

 Half a century back, most marriages were arranged. A network of relatives used to verify the antecedents of the prospective in-laws. That is seldom the case now. 

 Girls parents often lose their sense of reasoning at the prospect of having a techie son-in-law. A colleagues daughter was recently married off to an NRI techie. On reaching the foreign shores, the girl found to her dismay that the husband had a Caucasian wife. And this is not an isolated example. It is important for parents to exercise caution while choosing a groom for their daughter.

 Apropos the report Injection fine on medical store, June 28, such an inhuman crime cannot be punished only by a fine and compensation. It is surprising that the high court ruled that it was a mistake for which licence of the store concerned could not be cancelled. Such negligence in the attempt to make money cannot be termed a mistake; it is a social malady that needs to be eradicated.

 Apropos the report Wrong drug in risk rerun,

 June 29, it is shocking that a woman could have died because of the negligence

 of a chemist who handed her the wrong medicine. The chemist should be punished

 in an exemplary manner. The buyer, too, should not believe the chemist

 or the shop-owner without tallying the name on the prescription with that

 on the medicine. Recently, when I had asked for a cream called Rovate at

 a drug store, the owner, without hesitating for a second, gave me Revital,

 which is a capsule. The customers also need to stop buying medicines without

 prescription.

 The report Body swap in hospital, June 28, was shocking. Handing over a wrong body to the kin of a dead man is the height of negligence. The bodies of accident victims are often covered with a blanket, so the relatives are not able to identify the person right away. But the face should have been checked before taking the body away.

 Apropos the photograph titled Tongue-Tied, June 27, actor Ranjit Mullicks impersonation of a drug addict in the presence of the police commissioner on the International Day Against Drug Abuse was an abuse of the occasion. Any recently rehabilitated addict could have played the role more convincingly. The actor looked more like a bad comedian.

 Apropos the report Quite Contrary, June 18, though we have become more liberal, many still consider homosexuality unacceptable. Such an attitude leads to silent discrimination, which breeds a feeling of insecurity among homosexuals. He or she finds the going tough not only among friends and family members but also at work. Even effeminate people are often branded homo. Every individual must be given a chance to live the way he or she would like to. 

 Tanmoy Das Lala,

 Salt Lake 

Apropos the photograph of Akshay Kumar (Jumping Jack of Hearts, June 21), one fails to understand how he was permitted to perform a dangerous stunt in public. What if a youngster dies in trying to emulate the screen hero? 

 A.S. Mehta,

 New Alipore 

 Mishaps on the road are escalating rapidly (One dies as truck rams rickshaw, June 20). A reason could be that guilty drivers are not punished severely.

 Tribute to the art of Kieslowski

 A towering figure of East European cinema, Krzysztof Kieslowskis early documentaries focused on the everyday lives of city dwellers, workers and soldiers. To evade unfair censorship by an authoritarian regime, he began making films, deciding that fiction not only allowed more artistic freedom, but could portray everyday life more truthfully. As tribute to the master filmmaker, Cine Central, Calcutta is hosting a retrospective of his films, to be concluded today. The films being screened are: Decalogue X and A Short Film About Killing (at 4 pm) and Short Working Day and A Short Film About Love (at 6.30 pm). A Short Film About Love (a scene from the film appears right) tells the touching story of a woman who discovers the true meaning of love from an adolescent boy who stalks her.

 Event: Retrospective of the films of Krzysztof Kieslowski 

 When: Till today; 4 pm and 6.30 pm 

 Where: Nandan II

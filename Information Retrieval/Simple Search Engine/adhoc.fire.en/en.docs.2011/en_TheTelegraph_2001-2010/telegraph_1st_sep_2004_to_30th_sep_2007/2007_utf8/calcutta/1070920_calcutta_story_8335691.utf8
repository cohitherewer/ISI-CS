 Tutors veto Jan. session

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The academic session in schools is unlikely to start from January 2008, as the state government had announced. 

 The All Bengal Teachers Association (ABTA) has opposed the plan of going back to the pre-1988 system from the current schedule of May to April. The organisation of secondary school teachers is the strongest pro-CPM teachers group and has more members than similar groups.

 After discussing the issue, the members of our organisation have come to the conclusion that there is no need to start the academic session from January. If the government wants to bring about a change, it can advance the existing academic session by a month, said Shibaprasad Mukhopadhyay, the ABTA general secretary.

 The ABTA has recently written to the state government, making its stand clear.

 School education minister Partha De, who had announced the plan last year, on Wednesday said the proposal has not been shelved. 

 The committee that was set up by the government last year to examine the proposal of starting the academic session from January is still active. We will take a final decision on the matter only after getting the report of the committee, said De.

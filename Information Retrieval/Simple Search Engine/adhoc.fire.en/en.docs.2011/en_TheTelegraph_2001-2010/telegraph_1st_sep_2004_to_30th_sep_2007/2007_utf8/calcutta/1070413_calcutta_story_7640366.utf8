 Sutapa Bag has recovered but not broken her silence. The wife of the Howrah quack who was found dead along with his daughter last Wednesday, has refused to disclose what happened at the Andul home of the Bags. But her silence will not save her, warned sleuths.

 Sutapa, wife of Jayanta Bag, had told her sister Madhumita that she had strangled nine-year-old Tiyasa to death as she could not bear to see her daughter suffering after her throat had been slit. We have enough reason to slap murder charges on her, a criminal investigation department (CID) official told Metro on Thursday evening.

 Earlier in the day, CID sleuths and officers of Jagachha police station visited the Howrah District Hospital to interrogate Sutapa, but the 31-year-old woman maintained a stony silence.

 The attending doctors told us she was fit and she had spoken to her relatives through the day. But she refused to speak to us saying she could not remember anything about that nights incident, said Milan Kanta Das, additional superintendent of police (town), Howrah. 

 According to police, failing to bear the humiliation at the hands of a gang of four, Bag committed suicide after trying to kill Sutapa and Tiyasa. The youths Ujjwal Biswas, Raju Roy, Jhantu Pal and Chandu Koley had raided the Bag residence in Andul to teach him a lesson for taking photographs of women who had gone to him for abortions. 

 All the four men are in our custody and we have interrogated some local residents, but it is difficult to proceed in the case till Sutapa is in hospital, said Das. 

 On Thursday evening, the hospital authorities issued a release order for Sutapa. But till 10.30 pm , she was still in hospital.

 Investigating officers of Jagachha police station have already seized some crucial evidence a bunch of pornographic VCDs and nude photographs of Sutapa and her sister Madhumita from the Bag residence. 

 We have also got some objectionable pictures of Jouni Oraon, arrested along with Ujjwal in connection with the case, from Bags house, said Das.

 Following the sleaze trail, the investigating officers feel Bags death had some connection with shooting and selling of pornographic material.

 We will also interrogate Sutapas sister Madhumita to find out more about the photographs, said an investigating officer. 

 CID officials have also sought expert opinion on the post-mortem report submitted by Harasit Sarkar, the autopsy surgeon. 

 As the doctors findings do not corroborate the other evidence collected from the spot and statements provided by neighbours, we need to review the report, said Niraj Narayan Pandey, deputy inspector general, CID.

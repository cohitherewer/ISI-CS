 Mexican denied bail

 MID-AIR ANTICS: Feblex Ortiz Aeduardo Antonio. A Telegraph picture

 Feblex Ortiz Aeduardo Antonio, the Mexican national arrested on March 21 for his mid-air antics, was denied bail on Wednesday. He has been remanded in judicial custody till April 11.

 Additional chief judicial magistrate (Barrackpore) Gopal Chandra Karmakar examined the case diary and ordered the investigating officer of airport police station to expedite the probe.

 Arguing for bail, defence lawyer Krishnendu Sarkar submitted that police had failed to produce enough evidence to prove that a drunk Antonio had abused his co-passengers. He might have acted in self-defence, after being provoked by the passengers.

 Antonio, on a Bangkok-Delhi flight, had allegedly misbehaved with some co-passengers, assaulted them and even threatened to blow up the plane. The pilot had to make an unscheduled landing at Calcutta. Commenting on the behaviour, the magistrate said: Such an attitude is not desirable on board.

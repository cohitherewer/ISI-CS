 An award-winning Israeli editor has been roped in to give shape to a documentary on the Bob Dylan of the Northeast. Erez Laufer, who also directs films, spent three weeks in Calcutta supervising the editing of Forever Young, a documentary on Shillong-based performer Lou Majaw. 

 The film by Ranjan Palit traces the evolution of Majaw, who has been singing Dylans compositions for the past 30 years. Erez, who was invited to Calcutta by Steps India, an organisation promoting Indian documentaries, is excited about the project. 

 While editing the documentary, I discovered a wonderful world of music-lovers that I didnt know could exist in this part of the country, he said.

 The last film Eriz edited was Laura Poitras and Jocelyn Glatzers My Country My Country, which bagged this years Oscar nomination for the best documentary.

 The Israeli had assisted rockumentary film-maker D.A. Pennybaker for seven years in New York, before returning to his homeland to make his own films. 

 Erezs film on an Israeli singer called Mike Brant had won him the Israeli Academy Award in 2002. It was also screened at the Cannes Film Festival.

 His body of work includes Woodstock Diary, a three-part documentary featuring unreleased performances at the Woodstocks silver jubilee celebration and unreleased footage of Jimi Hendrixs performance with the Band of Gypsies.

 I have my roots in India, said Erez, while revealing his desire of making a documentary on his father fleeing from the Holocaust through Turkey, Palestine and Iraq to reach Mumbai on a boat.

 Erez recently directed The Darien Dilemma, a story about the plight of 1,000 Jews stranded on the Danube river during the Holocaust. 

 Erez who left the city on Tuesday expressed hopes to return in May for a better tour of Calcutta, before the documentary is ready for its premiere on BBC in July.

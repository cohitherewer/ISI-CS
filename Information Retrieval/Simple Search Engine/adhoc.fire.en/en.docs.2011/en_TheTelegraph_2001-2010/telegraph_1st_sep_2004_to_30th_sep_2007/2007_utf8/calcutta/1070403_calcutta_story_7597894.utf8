 Life term is jail till death

 - Convict freed on bail after 22 years sent back to prison

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Kallol Bhattacharya, 50-year-old convict released on bail by the high court 22 months ago after spending almost 22 years behind the bars, was sent back to jail on Monday.

 A division bench of the court, while rejecting Bhattacharyas appeal against a trial court verdict that found him guilty of murder, stated: The Supreme Court has ruled that life imprisonment means detention in jail till death. As this court upholds the judgment of the trial court, the convict will have to go to jail again. 

 A division bench, headed by former Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar, had granted Bhattacharya bail after being told that the appeal moved by him against the trial courts order had been pending for 21 years. Free the man first. His appeal will be heard later, the division bench had ruled.

 The common man is of the impression that a life term means 14 years in jail. But the apex court has ruled that life term will be treated as jail sentence till end of life. Only the judicial review committees can remit the term, said Bhattacharyas advocate Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee. No judicial committee has reviewed Bhattacharyas case, he added.

 Bhattacharya, a resident of Kalicharan Ghosh Road, in north Calcutta, worked in a firm engaged in Metro Railway projects. According to the prosecutions case, he had murdered his father-in-law on December 28, 1983, after he refused to lend him Rs 2,000 for starting a business. Bhattacharya was arrested the same day. During trial, five witnesses, including his wife Champaklata, testified against him. 

 The 14th criminal court in Alipore, in 1992, convicted Bhattacharya for the murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. His family, comprising his wife, a son and a daughter, did not pursue the case.

 In 2005, the authorities of Alipore Central jail informed the high court that Bhattacharya had been imprisoned for 22 years and no judicial review of the case had been conducted. On that basis, the former chief justice directed the government to release him from jail, said advocate Chatterjee.

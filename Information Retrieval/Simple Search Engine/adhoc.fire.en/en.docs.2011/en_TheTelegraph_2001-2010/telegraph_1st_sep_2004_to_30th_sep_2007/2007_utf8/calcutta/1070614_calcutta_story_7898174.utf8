 The transport department has moved in against taxi drivers using faulty meters or refusing to ferry passengers to destinations they find inconvenient.

 The department, for the first time in the city, will install an electronic device to check taxi meters. The testing centre will come up at the Salt Lake stadium by June-end.

 It will be made mandatory for taxi drivers to get their meters checked every six months at the centre, said a transport department official. The job will be outsourced to a private agency, though our officials will keep a close watch on the proceedings on a daily basis.

 Taxi drivers are now asked to ply a two-km stretch at the Lakes to check whether the meter is giving the right reading. But experts in the field consider the process flawed. The imported device will give an authentic account of the functioning of the meters, the official pointed out.

 Taxi drivers will be issued a certificate if the meters are in perfect condition. But if a meter is found to be tampered with or having a snag, the driver will be penalised and will be allowed to ply only after the flaw is rectified, he added.

 In another move, the transport department has circulated a note among senior officials, asking them to take stringent measures against taxi drivers refusing to ferry passengers till 9pm. After that, they have the right to decline trips to far-off places.

 Recent complaints have prompted the department to think of taking punitive measures against taxi drivers harassing commuters. One can lodge a complaint with public vehicles department director Mohammad Kamran or deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim, said another official.

 However, all are not happy with the move to get taxi meters checked by a private agency. While the decision of hauling up a taxi driver for refusing to ferry passengers is commendable, we are not comfortable with the idea of a private firm checking our meters. The transport department should do the job itself, said Bengal Taxi Association secretary Bimal Guha.

 Citing recent reports on corrupt practices at private auto-emission testing centres across the city, Guha expressed fear that dishonest drivers would buy the certificates from the Salt Lake centre without getting the meters checked.

 We are trying hard to catch errant drivers who have tampered with their meters. Now, if they are armed with the certificate, we have our hands tied, Guha observed.
